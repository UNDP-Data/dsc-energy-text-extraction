working-paper-394-colesanti-senni-von-jagow (PDF)﻿ The risks posed by water
stress to the energy sector and in particular to hydroelectricity generation
have received little attention in the academic literature, yet they are
important to understand because hydropower is a central piece in the low-carbon
transition puzzle and the effects of climate change on water availability will
determine the effectiveness of hydropower projects. This paper studies the
impact of reduced water availability on hydroelectricity generation in Europe
and the United States. The authors match information on the location of
hydropower plants with information on water risk and historical precipitation.
They consider changes in hydropower generation in 2021 – a low-rainfall year –
compared with the historical average. They find that plants located in basins
with a higher exposure to water-related risks produced less electricity than
their historical average compared with plants located in less risky basins. They
also examine changes in precipitation over time and find that an increase in
precipitation is associated with higher levels of electricity generation. These
results show that water stress is material to hydroelectricity generation and
can be used to provide estimates of the effect of water stress on hydropower
generation  for high-income economies . This is important because much of the
literature on economic impacts on natural resource scarcity is focused on
developing economies, arguably because they have a higher dependence on their
natural resource base. However, it is important to note that vulnerabilities
related to natural resources also exist in developed economies. The estimates in
the paper can be used for planning hydropower output as one way to decarbonise
energy supply, as well as for calibrating economy-wide models of climate change
that include hydroelectricity production. The paper also provides a framework
for understanding the impact of other forms of environmental risks on different
sectors and economic activities. Key points for decision-makers Existing
hydropower plants are the largest source of low-emission electricity globally
and the International Energy Agency estimates that hydropower capacity could
double by 2050, representing about 15% of total electricity generation in its
net zero scenario. Changes in water availability that reduce the generating
capacity of hydropower plants might hinder the transition to a low-carbon
economy. Failing to account for these risks in forward-looking risk assessments
could lead to a rapid financial revaluation of the firms and economic activities
exposed to such risks. To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first paper
to provide a multi-country analysis of the impact of changes in water
availability on hydroelectricity generation at the plant level in high-income
economies and using location-specific information on water-related risks and
hydro-meteorological data. They find that hydroelectric plants located in
riskier water basins produced less electricity in 2021, a low-rainfall year,
than their historical average (2015–2020) compared with plants located in less
risky basins. An increase in precipitation is associated with higher levels of
electricity generation. The empirical strategies adopted in the paper offer a
framework that can be replicated across similar datasets for other nature-
related risks.                   Hoover Dam, Nevada. Photo: CC0 Public
