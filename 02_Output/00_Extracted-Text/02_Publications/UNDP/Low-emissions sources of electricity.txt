electricity                 Renewables capacity triples by 2030 led by solar PV
and wind, complemented by growth in nuclear and other sources, raising the share
of low-emissions sources in electricity generation from 39% in 2022 to 71% in
2030 and 100% in 2050.                 Low-emissions electricity generation
