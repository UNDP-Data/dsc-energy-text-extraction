Our work / Research & analysis Africa Carbon Markets Initiative: Roadmap Report
Research    08 Nov 2022 Share this page     Download report Climate change
presents the continent of Africa with multiple challenges. African countries are
particularly exposed to the physical risks arising from the global rise in
temperatures. They also face the question of how to manage and finance the
economic transformation that will be required to curb greenhouse gas emissions
and halt the destruction of nature. One important answer is the subject of this
report — namely the role that voluntary carbon markets could play in Africa’s
energy transition and commercialization of its nature assets. Voluntary carbon
markets (VCMs) represent a major opportunity to accelerate economic development
and simultaneously curb greenhouse gas emissions. But seizing this opportunity
will take thoughtful and deliberate action, especially by African stakeholders.
This document is intended as a practical guide for how this immense potential
could be realised. It sets out an ambition for voluntary carbon markets in
Africa and proposes action to help fulfil that ambition. Sign up to our
