transition: Labour and employer perspectives      A just energy transition – in
which no one is left behind – is critical to ensure broad social acceptance of
the profound changes the transition entails. This Coalition for Action brief
captures the concerns, insights and recommendations of trade unions and energy
sector employers on how the energy transition can develop in a just manner for
all.                         ISBN: 978-92-9260-536-0 August 2023 Home >
Publications > 2023 > Aug >   Newsletter    Go A rapid transition to a renewable
energy system is imperative if the world is to avoid the worst impacts of
climate change; but a just transition – where no one is left behind – is
critical to meet justice and equity demands and ensure broad social acceptance
of the profound changes the energy transition entails. IRENA consulted with
trade unions and energy sector employers to understand their perspectives and
build consensus on a net zero future. This Coalition for Action brief captures
their concerns, insights, and recommendations on how the energy transition can
develop in a just manner for all. A key conclusion drawn from this dialogue is
that all voices must be heard, especially those of workers and communities on
the front line of the transition who will be most affected. If the transition is
to gain the full support of the labour movement, the focus must be on job
quality not just quantity. Social dialogue should play a greater role in shaping
energy transition labour policies. Business requires consistent policy and a
level playing field – such as long-term policies for renewables, robust
regulatory frameworks and effective auction criteria reflecting just transition
demands. In order to build a workforce for the future green economy, training
and education must meet anticipated needs. In addition, greater workforce
diversity, and the participation of women, ethnic minorities and youth, are not
only ethical imperatives but also necessary for broadening the talent pool.
Finally, funding must significantly increase to achieve Sustainable Development
Goals and Paris Agreement commitments. Proactive efforts are therefore needed to
align financial flows with just transition demands.   Related content
