The climate–care nexus: Addressing the linkages between climate change and
women’s and girls’ unpaid care, domestic, and communal work Publication year:
2023 Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to LinkedIn Share to E-mail The
transformation of societies and economies towards paradigms centred on
interdependence, care, and sustainability is urgently needed. In this context,
this working paper sheds light on emerging efforts to address women’s and girls’
unpaid care, domestic, and communal work in a dramatically changing climate. The
paper discusses the ways in which climate change and environmental degradation
disrupt the care economy and increase and intensify women’s and girls’ unpaid
care, domestic, and communal work. The paper analyses emerging national efforts
to address unpaid care and domestic work through multilateral environmental
agreements and valuing paid and unpaid care work in gender-responsive just
transitions. The paper concludes with recommendations for governments,
international organizations, UN agencies, academia, and civil society at a key
moment for rethinking the dominant development model based on the extraction and
exploitation of natural resources, fossil fuels, and human lives, and for making
caring for people and the planet a central concern. Additional documents
