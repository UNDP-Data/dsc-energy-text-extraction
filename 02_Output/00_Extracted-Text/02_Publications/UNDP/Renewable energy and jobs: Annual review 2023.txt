Annual review 2023   Newsletter    Go The tenth edition of IRENA’s  Renewable
energy and jobs: Annual review , produced in collaboration with the
International Labour Organization (ILO), provides the latest estimates of
renewable energy employment globally and an overview of the renewable energy
employment landscape as of 2022. It discusses deployment trends and policy
contexts in selected countries. The report highlights growing interest in
localising supply chains, driven not only by concerns about possible disruptions
due to natural disasters, trade disputes or geopolitical rivalries but also by
interest in boosting domestic value creation and jobs. Numerous countries are
adopting industrial policy strategies to this end, while many resource-rich
countries are taking steps to move beyond being suppliers of raw materials. The
report emphasises that education and training programmes must be expanded to
prevent the widening of skill gaps. Such measures must be paired with efforts to
tap talent among under-represented groups including women, youth and minorities.
It also notes that labour rights and social dialogue are indispensable for an
energy transition that produces a truly just transition for all. Achieving the
energy transition in a manner consistent with climate stability requires much
faster renewables’ deployment, in turn creating more jobs; but it also demands
broader, systemic change, to make the economy more compatible with planetary
limits. Read digital story here:  A decade of progress: Renewables jobs on the
