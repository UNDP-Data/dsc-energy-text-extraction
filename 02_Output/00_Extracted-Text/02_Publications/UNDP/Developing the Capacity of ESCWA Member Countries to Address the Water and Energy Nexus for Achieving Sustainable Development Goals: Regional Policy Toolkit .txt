Water and Energy Nexus for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals: Regional
Policy Toolkit ﻿﻿The water and energy nexus regional policy toolkit was prepared
as part of the United Nations Development Account (UNDA) project on developing
the capacity of ESCWA Member Countries to address the water and energy nexus for
achieving Sustainable Development Goals. This project aims to build the capacity
of ministries and public service providers in the Arab region to examine and
address the water and energy nexus in an integrated manner. ESCWA Member States
recognize the importance of integrating water and energy resources management.
Endorsed by the 27th ESCWA Ministerial Session in May 2012, a recommendation was
issued by the ESCWA Committee on Water Resources to examine the water-energy
nexus and was welcomed by the ESCWA Energy Committee. In response, ESCWA
organized an “Intergovernmental Consultative Meeting on the Water and Energy
Nexus in the Arab Region” (Beirut, June 2012) for members of both ESCWA
intergovernmental committees to exchange views on the water and energy nexus
within the regional context.  The meeting resulted in the identification of
seven priority areas, namely:  (a) Raising awareness and disseminating
knowledge; (b) Increasing policy coherence; (c) Examining the water-energy
security nexus; (d) increasing efficiency; (e) Informing technology choices; (f)
Promoting renewable energy; (g) Addressing climate change and natural disasters.
The water and energy nexus regional policy toolkit contains seven modules, each
addressing one of the identified priority areas. Keywords:  ENERGY PLANNING
