About this report Electricity is central to many parts of life in modern
societies and will become even more so as its role in transport and heating
expands through technologies such as electric vehicles and heat pumps. Power
generation is currently the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions
globally, but it is also the sector that is leading the transition to net zero
emissions through the rapid ramping up of renewables such as solar and wind. At
the same time, the current global energy crisis has placed electricity security
and affordability high on the political agenda in many countries.  The
International Energy Agency’s  Electricity Market Report 2023  offers a deep
analysis of recent policies, trends and market developments. It also provides
forecasts through 2025 for electricity demand, supply and CO 2  emissions – with
a detailed study of the evolving generation mix. This year’s report contains a
comprehensive analysis of developments in Europe, which faced a variety of
energy crises in 2022. The Asia Pacific region also receives special focus, with
its fast-growing electricity demand and accelerating clean energy deployment.
The IEA’s  Electricity Market Report  has been published since 2020. Its
relevance goes beyond energy and climate issues, since electricity supply
impacts economies, regional development, the budgets of businesses and
households, and many other areas. It is indispensable reading for anyone
interested in the multifaceted importance of energy in our economies and
societies today. Published February 2023 License CC BY 4.0 Press release Share
