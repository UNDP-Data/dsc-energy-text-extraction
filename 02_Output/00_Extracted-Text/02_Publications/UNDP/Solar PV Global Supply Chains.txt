About this report Solar PV is a crucial pillar of clean energy transitions
worldwide, underpinning efforts to reach international energy and climate goals.
Over the last decade, the amount of solar PV deployed around the world has
increased massively while its costs have declined drastically. Putting the world
on a path to reaching net zero emissions requires solar PV to expand globally on
an even greater scale, raising concerns about security of manufacturing supply
for achieving such rapid growth rates – but also offering new opportunities for
diversification. This special report examines solar PV supply chains from raw
materials all the way to the finished product, spanning the five main segments
of the manufacturing process: polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules.
The analysis covers supply, demand, production, energy consumption, emissions,
employment, production costs, investment, trade and financial performance,
highlighting key vulnerabilities and risks at each stage. Because
diversification is one of the key strategies for reducing supply chain risks,
the report assesses the opportunities and challenges of developing solar PV
supply chains in terms of job creation, investment requirements, manufacturing
costs, emissions and recycling. Finally, the report summarises policy approaches
that governments have taken to support domestic solar PV manufacturing and
provides recommendations based on those. Published July 2022 License CC BY 4.0
