Characterised by remoteness from global markets due to the absence of
territorial access to the sea, landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) grapple
with myriad special challenges, including complex procedures for border transit,
exacerbated by poor infrastructure, inefficient logistics systems and weak
institutions. LLDCs feature among the poorest of the developing countries; of
the 32 LLDCs, 17 are categorised as least developed countries (LDCs). Many LLDCs
are rich in renewable resources and can take full advantage of decreasing
renewable energy costs to make progress in realising a clean energy transition
and close the access gap, while creating new jobs and advancing socio-economic
and industrialisation objectives. This report was produced jointly by IRENA and
the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed
Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States
(UN-OHRLLS). It provides an overview of deployment trends, drivers, barriers and
opportunities for energy transition in LLDCs, while focusing on the challenges
they face in attracting renewables investment towards achieving universal access
and net zero targets. The report offers recommendations for LLDCs to accelerate
deployment in line with the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. In addition,
this report contributes to the substantive preparatory process on the thematic
area of renewable energy for the Third United Nations Conference on LLDCs in
2024, which aims to formulate and adopt a renewed framework for international
support.    Additional analyses                                Sustainable
