Lighting Solutions in Nigeria                 Derisking Sustainable Off-Grid
Lighting Solutions in Nigeria                Summary The UNDP-GEF Project is
designed to develop a Private Sector-led technology value for making off-grid
renewable energy technologies, such as solar lanterns and solar home systems,
available to base-of-pyramid rural households who would not be electrified at
least until after 2025. The Project will directly support the implementation of
the Rural Electrification Strategy and Implementation Plan (2016) and the energy
access targets in the SE4All Investment Prospectus. The Project rationale is
underpinned by a novel approach to derisk private sector investments in the
market for rural decentralised renewable energy access. The long-term impact of
the project is to achieve Green House Gas(GHG) emission reductions with strong
sustainable development co-benefits through the deployment of off-grid solar-
powered solutions for lighting and electrical appliances (Section IV). The long-
term outcomes of the project relate to addressing the underlying barriers
thereby reducing risks for establishing a private sector led supply chain model
for rural energy access that will be both sustainable and replicable .  
The lifetime global environmental benefits that will accrue from the adoption of
off-grid solar technologies is estimated at ~108 ktCO2e. Consequential emission
reductions amounting to ~5,644 ktCO2e are expected between 2020 and 2029
predominantly through the replication of the sustainable technology value chain.
The project yields a GEF abatement cost of 0.46 US$/tCO2e. Target Beneficiaries
and Their Location   Geographic focus :  coverage: It is estimated that 70% of
Nigerians that live in rural areas currently do not have access to the national
electricity power grid. These communities are typically found in:  i. The far
North-East and far North-West, up to the border with Niger Republic and
Cameroon; ii. The coastal areas of the Niger-Delta; iii. The highlands of the
South-West, up the border with the Republic of Benin; and iv. The mountainous
regions of the South-East, up to the border with Cameroun   Target beneficiaries
:  In this Project, rural communities in at least 12 States representative of
the 6 geopolitical regions of Nigeria will be involved as direct beneficiaries.
            Project Outcomes            The project rationale is underpinned by
a novel approach to derisk private sector investments in the market for rural
decentralised renewable energy access. This will be achieved through three
outcomes: P utting in place appropriate policies, programmes and regulations
that address policy, awareness and financial barriers to facilitate investment
in sustainable off-grid lighting solutions and corresponding business models;  O
ff-grid lighting providers are operating and have access to working capital and
equipment; and  G ood practices, lessons learned, market assessments, demand-
supply surveys, delivery models and business models are documented to support
replication and scaling-up of project results. The number of direct project
beneficiaries is expected to be around 96,380 persons, of which approximately
47,540 women.           Related Materials Annual Workplan 2021/22 Download
