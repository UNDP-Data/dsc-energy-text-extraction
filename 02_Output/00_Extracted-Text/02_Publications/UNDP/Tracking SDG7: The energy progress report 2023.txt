report 2023   Newsletter    Go This annual report tracks global progress toward
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 : Achieving affordable, reliable,
sustainable and modern energy for all. It serves as a guide for policymakers and
the international community in advancing energy access, energy efficiency,
renewable energy and international cooperation to achieve SDG 7. IRENA produces
the report jointly with the SDG 7 co-custodian agencies: the International
Energy Agency (IEA), the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), the World
Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The preparatory process for the
2023 edition was chaired by the WHO. The latest data indicate that the world is
not on track to achieve any of the SDG7 targets. In 2021, 675 million people
still lacked access to electricity. Of those, 567 million people lived in Sub-
Saharan Africa – accounting for more than 80% of the global population without
access. Meanwhile, 2.3 billion people lacked access to clean cooking, largely in
sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. At the current rate of progress, 660 million people
are projected to still lack access to electricity in 2030, and 1.9 billion
people would continue to rely on polluting cooking fuels. Meanwhile, renewable
energy deployment has risen significantly in the power sector, growing by around
27 percent in 2010-2020 and 7 percent in 2019-2020 – the largest annual growth
recorded over the past three decades. The share of renewable sources in total
final energy consumption reached 19.1 percent globally in 2020, compared to
16.7% in 2010. However, current progress is insufficient and renewable energy
deployment must accelerate considerably – particularly in heat and transport.
Progress in energy efficiency measures is also off track, with only a 0.6% rate
of improvement in 2021. Energy intensity must improve at no less than
3.4 percent annually from now until 2030 to make up for the shortfall.
Meanwhile, international public financial flows to developing countries to
support clean energy decreased for the third year running, amounting to USD 10.8
billion in 2021. This is only about 40% of the 2017 peak of USD 26.4 billion. In
order to realise SDG 7 and related SDGs by 2030, the SDG 7 custodian agencies
emphasise the need for: stronger and more tangible commitments to close the gaps
in access to electricity and clean cooking fuels and technologies; a fundamental
transformation of the global energy system as a precondition for sustainable
development and global energy security; and the importance of international
cooperation and financing to deliver on the considerable promise of the energy
transition. Find the dashboards and additional information on the  Tracking SDG
