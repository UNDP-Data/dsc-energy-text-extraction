Regional Energy Transition (2nd Edition)   Newsletter    Go The Southeast Asia
region will see rapid economic growth in the coming decades and energy use is
set to grow significantly. Today, the region stands at a crossroads. On the one
hand, it can pursue a path of continued reliance on fossil fuels, most of which
come from non-indigenous sources, increasing the region’s emissions and exposure
to volatile and increasingly expensive global commodity markets. On the other,
the region could utilise its ample, affordable, indigenous renewable energy
resources to lower energy costs, reduce emissions and drive regional economic
development. This second edition of the ASEAN Renewable Energy Outlook was
developed in collaboration with the ASEAN Center for Energy (ACE) and the ASEAN
Renewable Energy Sub-sector Network. It is guided by IRENA’s  World Energy
Transitions Outlook  and details a comprehensive pathway for the development of
a sustainable and cleaner regional energy system. It explores the role of end-
use sector electrification, expansion of renewable generation, energy efficiency
solutions, emerging technologies such as electric vehicles, hydrogen and battery
storage-systems, as well the importance of expanding regional power sector
integration.  As the region commits to ever more ambitious climate targets,
including net zero commitments, planning must now begin in earnest. While ASEAN
has ambitious renewable energy goals in the near-term, the region needs to think
and plan for the long-term. It has a unique opportunity to develop a sustainable
energy system based on renewable energy resources that can support recovery and
development while addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation
strategies, and accomplishing energy security, universalisation and
affordability goals. An interactive dashboard containing regional and some
country-specific results, covering key energy indicators, energy demand, power
sector, and emissions for IRENA results from the report can be accessed below.
