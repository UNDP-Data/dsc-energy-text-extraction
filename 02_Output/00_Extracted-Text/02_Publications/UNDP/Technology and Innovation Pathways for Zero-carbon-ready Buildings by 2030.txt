zero-carbon-ready codes for new buildings by 2030
arrow-right                                 Renovation of near 20% of existing
building stock to zero-carbon-ready by 2030 is ambitious but necessary
arrow-right                                 Installation of about 600 million
heat pumps covering 20% of buildings heating needs required by 2030
arrow-right                                 Approximately 100 million households
rely on rooftop solar PV by 2030                              arrow-right
Solar PV and wind supply about 40% of building electricity use by 2030
arrow-right                                 350 million building units connected
to district energy networks by 2030, provide about 20% of space heating needs
arrow-right                                 Solar thermal technologies deployed
in around 400 million dwellings by 2030                              arrow-right

right                                 Residential behaviour changes lead to a
reduction in heating and cooling energy use by 2030
arrow-right                                 By 2030 EVs represent more than 60%
of vehicles sold globally, and require an adequate surge in chargers installed
in buildings                              arrow-right         Related content
