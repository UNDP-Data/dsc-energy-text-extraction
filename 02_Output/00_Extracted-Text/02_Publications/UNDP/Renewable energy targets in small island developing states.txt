Technical Papers > Renewable energy targets in small island developing states
Newsletter    Go Climate change, combined with recent geopolitical developments,
has sent shockwaves throughout the global economy, magnifying concerns around
energy security, food security and weather-related disasters. Small island
developing states (SIDS), which are amongst the lowest emitters worldwide, are
most at risk from these potential threats. However, they are increasingly
employing ambitious plans to deploy renewable energy in order to secure its
multiple benefits. This technical paper presents a quantification of SIDS’
renewable energy targets, both in their national energy plans and in their NDCs,
comparing commitments made within their national policies and plans with those
that extend to the Paris Agreement framework. The conditionality of commitments
is explored, where applicable highlighting the urgent need to mobilise
international support to SIDS in the form of financing, technology transfer and
technical assistance, to help meet their renewable energy commitments.   Related
