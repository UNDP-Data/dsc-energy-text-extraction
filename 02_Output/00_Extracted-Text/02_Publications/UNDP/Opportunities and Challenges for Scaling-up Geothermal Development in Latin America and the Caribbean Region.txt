Ramirez, Ximena Rosio; Jayawardena, Migara; Armstrong, John S.; Peabody, Stan;
Turner, Juan Andres; Rivera Zeballos, Sergio Aurelio;    Opportunities and
Challenges for Scaling-up Geothermal Development in Latin America and the
Caribbean Region Geothermal energy can play a substantial role in meeting the
energy needs of many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean
(LAC) Region given the region’s vast potential. The majority of geothermal
resources in the LAC region remain largely untapped, not only in Central America
and Mexico where development is more advanced, but also in the Caribbean and in
South America. If further explored and developed in a sustainable fashion, these
resources could meet a significant share of the base load power needs of the
region, at a competitive cost, resulting in direct economic and environmental
benefits. This report is envisioned to be a decision-makers’ guide for assessing
key challenges and measures to facilitate expanding geothermal development in
LAC. Based on discussions with LAC policy makers, utilities, and developers,
several cross-cutting challenges affecting most countries in the region were
identified, including i) addressing geothermal resource risks; ii) mobilizing
financing for geothermal development; iii) policy, legal, and regulatory reforms
to improve the investment climate; and iv) environmental and social
considerations. Based on the World Bank’s own extensive experience in the
geothermal sector and drawing upon global and regional experience, this report
then presents demonstrated solutions to addressing these key challenges. It
showcases an array of measures from around the world that clients in LAC can
customize for application in their own domestic markets. Citation Berman, Laura
