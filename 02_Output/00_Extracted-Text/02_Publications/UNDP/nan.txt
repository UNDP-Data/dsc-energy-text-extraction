From Waste to Energy: Kaduwela Municipal Council and UNDP work towards
sustainable waste management   March 21, 2021             Colombo, Sri Lanka, 21
March 2021:  To create a transformation in the management of municipal waste, by
generating electricity and producing liquid fertilizer using bio degradable
solid waste, a Biogas system was handed over to the ownership of the Kaduwela
Municipal Council (KMC) this morning, under the leadership of Hon. Mayor
Buddhika Jayavilal with the participation of Mr. Robert Juhkam, Resident
Representative, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka and Mr
Harsha Wickramasinghe, Deputy Director General, Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy
Authority. Following the successful pilot phase of the biogas demonstration unit
capable of processing 1 tonne, this joint initiative of UNDP and KMC aims to
increase the productivity of the Solid Waste Management Unit in Kaduwela, to
process 10 tonnes of bio-degradable solid waste per day. This waste which would
have ended up in landfills, now generates electricity that is exported to the
grid and produces liquid organic fertilizer, resulting in a reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions by 1000-1300 tonnes per annum. Research shows that the
Western Province generates more than 59% of the country’s daily collection of
waste, amounting to over 4200 tonnes, with high degree of biodegradability.
However, the high biodegradability of the waste can also cause problems for the
environment and society, unless effective and efficient waste management systems
are established. UNDP in Sri Lanka entered into a Government Co-Financed project
with the Kaduwela Municipal Council in December 2016 and has since been
supporting the KMC and the Government of Sri Lanka to effectively manage solid
waste and generate biogas energy. The project is a part of the Government’s
plans for a greener Sri Lanka, which aims to increase the use of renewable
energy to 70% by 2023, and the Government’s 2015 Energy Sector Development Plan
to make Sri Lanka an energy self-sufficient nation by 2030. ****         Search
