Socioeconomic Benefits Triggered by Renewables_Nov16-22.pdf PUBLISHED October 26
2022 AUTHOR(S) SRMI Facility   A Sure Path to Sustainable Renewable Energy:
Maximizing Socioeconomic Benefits Triggered by Renewables Over the past decade,
the large-scale deployment of renewable energy (RE) technologies has unveiled
the massive potential of RE to generate socioeconomic (SE) benefits. As a
result, RE and SE outcomes are leaping to the forefront of government
discussions and strategic decision making. This is particularly true in
developing economies, where governments see the growth of the RE sector as an
opportunity to develop new skills and create new jobs for their people, improve
gender equality, contribute to industrial development, and support local
development in sites surrounding RE projects.   However, an assortment of
obstacles can keep countries from realizing the full benefits of RE deployment.
 A Sure Path to Sustainable Renewable Energy: Maximizing Socioeconomic Benefits
Triggered by Renewables, a product of the Sustainable Renewables Risk Mitigation
Initiative, has been designed to address these challenges and spell out the
steps and entry points for boosting the socioeconomic benefits of RE programs.
   The report details the steps involved in developing a program to maximize the
socioeconomic benefits of an RE deployment. It highlights links connecting the
steps and sets out an integrated approach. The handbook also includes a
diagnostic tool to lay the path forward and track national progress toward a
successful RE program that maximizes socioeconomic benefits.     Citation
