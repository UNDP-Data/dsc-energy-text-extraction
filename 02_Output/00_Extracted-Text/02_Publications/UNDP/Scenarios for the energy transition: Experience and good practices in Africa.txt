African nations use long-term scenarios and energy planning tools to inform
national planning. When the right institutional framework is in place, countries
can assess alternative pathways to ensure energy access for all, mainstream the
use of large- and small-scale renewables, and advance toward a just and
sustainable energy system, while building consensus on the desired energy
future.   This report summarises the presentations and discussions held at the
webinar series entitled:  Long-Term Energy Scenarios (LTES) for Developing
National Energy Transition Plans in Africa . It presents key findings and
recommendations that are broadly relevant to African countries, as well as to
stakeholders attempting to improve their planning processes across the world.
Good practices include the implementation of innovative approaches for the
development and use of long-term energy scenarios, diversifying methods of
communicating scenarios with the public, and progress in building and
maintaining local energy planning units.   Additional analyses    Related
