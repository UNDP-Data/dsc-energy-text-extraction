Even during a power outage in the village, the formerly dark street is now well-
lit at night   July 17, 2023             UNDP “Sustainable Communities”
programme has recently completed the installation of 18 km of street lighting
system using green technologies in 17 bordering settlements of Vardenis
community, Gegharkunik region, affected by 2022 September hostilities. Overall,
more than 600 solar-powered luminaries have been installed to ensure safe
nighttime movement and improve the quality of life in beneficiary settlements. 
  “The solar luminaries are making a difference in people's lives. Despite the
frequent and lengthy power outages in the settlement, the street lighting no
longer goes off,” said Sevak Khachatryan, the administrative representative of
Sotk settlement, highlighting the impact of the recently installed off-grid
solar streetlights. The bordering Sotk settlement is home to around 900 people.
The settlement bears the brunt of the conflict in Gegharkunik region, which
caused extensive infrastructure damage and affected accessibility of basic
services, including street lighting. UNDP stepped in with sustainable solutions
for rehabilitating the street lighting system in Vardenis area speeding up post-
conflict recovery and improving the livability of conflict-affected settlements
in Vardenis municipality.    According to Mr. Aharon Khachatryan, the head of
Vardenis community, the partnership with UNDP is bringing about much-needed
change by supporting the municipality to respond to local needs, improve
livelihoods and foster resilience. “As an aftermath of the hostilities, we have
17 more bordering settlements, where the movement after sunset is paralyzed and
the sense of protection and safety are very low during nighttime due to the
absence of streetlights. Thanks to UNDP the situation has changed. Even during a
power outage in the village, the formerly dark street is now well-lit at night”,
Mr. Aharon Khachatryan adds.   UNDP makes also an impactful contribution towards
the stability and resilience of Kut settlement. “The insufficient coverage of
the former outdated lighting system and the inefficiencies of electric bulbs are
solved through solar-powered luminaries additionally producing savings in
community budget,”- said Grigor Avakyan, administrative representative of Kut
settlement. As a result of UNDP work, 5000 people benefit from increased
resilience and sustainability due to restoring and greening street lighting
system in 17 conflict-affected settlements in Vardenis municipality.  The
initiative is funded by UNDP Crisis Bureau.                  Stories Go-karting
