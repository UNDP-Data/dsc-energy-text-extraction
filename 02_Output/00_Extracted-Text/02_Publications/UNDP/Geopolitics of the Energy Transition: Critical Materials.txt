Browse by theme               Critical materials are today the focus of much
international dialogue and diplomacy. Their production and processing are highly
concentrated geographically, posing challenges related to resource security and
geopolitical dynamics. This concentration creates vulnerabilities and
uncertainties for both consuming and producing countries that may affect the
deployment, cost and sustainability of energy transition technologies.
Strategies to diversify the supply and production chains for these materials are
starting to emerge, reflecting multiple economic, political and social
priorities and considerations. The dependency risks and supply dynamics of
critical materials fundamentally differ from those of fossil fuels, owing to
their vastly different characteristics and patterns.  Geopolitics of the energy
transition: Critical materials  highlights that current patterns of production
and processing will remain largely unchanged in the coming years, stressing the
importance of international cooperation and prudent policy choices to ensure
that the energy transition advances at the necessary speed worldwide. It urges
the development of transparent markets with coherent standards and norms,
grounded in human rights, environmental stewardship and community engagement.
The report also examines possibilities for developing countries to advance their
industrialisation strategies and capture greater economic value from their
mineral wealth. The report offers a forward-looking examination of the
geopolitical and geoeconomic aspects and implications associated with the
anticipated increase in the demand for, and supply of, critical materials. It
investigates the evolving landscape of supply chains and trade patterns, as well
as the socioeconomic and sustainability factors surrounding extraction and
processing. Additionally, the report assesses the strategic significance of
critical materials for economic competitiveness and the acceleration of
renewable energy transitions.   Additional analyses
