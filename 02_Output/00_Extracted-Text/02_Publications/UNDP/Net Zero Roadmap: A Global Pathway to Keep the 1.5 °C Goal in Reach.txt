About this report In May 2021, the IEA published its landmark report  Net Zero
Emissions by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector.  The report set out a
narrow but feasible pathway for the global energy sector to contribute to the
Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 °C
above pre-industrial levels. The  Net Zero Roadmap  quickly became an important
benchmark for policy makers, industry, the financial sector and civil society.
Since the report was released, many changes have taken place, notably amid the
global energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
And energy sector carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise, reaching a
new record in 2022. Yet there are also increasing grounds for optimism: the last
two years have also seen remarkable progress in developing and deploying some
key clean energy technologies. This 2023 update to our  Net Zero Roadmap
surveys this complex and dynamic landscape and sets out an updated pathway to
net zero by 2050, taking account of the key developments that have occurred
since 2021. This report is part of the IEA’s support of the first global
stocktake of the Paris Agreement, which will be finalized in the run up to
COP28, the next UN Climate Change Conference, at the end of 2023. Find other
reports in this series on the IEA’s  Global Energy Transitions Stocktake  page.

Net Zero by 2050 report included numerous tables presenting more than 400 key
milestones for different sectors and technologies on the pathway to reach net
zero emissions from the global energy sector by 2050. These proved to be highly
useful for numerous stakeholders, including actors from industry, finance, and
policymaking. In this year’s edition, we have brought together these milestones
in one place as a set of fifteen technology and sector-specific dashboards.
