About this report The 8th Annual Global Conference on Energy Efficiency, in
Versailles, co-hosted by IEA Executive Director Dr. Fatih Birol and French
Minister for Energy Transition Her Excellency Agnès Pannier-Runacher, is the
IEA’s largest energy efficiency conference, with representatives from over 80
countries, 30 ministers, 50 CEOs, and 650 participants. In support of the
meeting, the IEA produced the report  Energy Efficiency – The Decade for Action
, which highlights the importance of energy efficiency actions in the coming
years. The analysis examines recent trends relating to demand and policies and
the next steps for the improvement, implementation and investment required for
an energy efficient future.   The IEA also developed its policy toolkit for
governments,  The Energy Efficiency Policy Toolkit 2023: From Sønderborg to
Versailles,  a set of strategic principles and new and updated policy packages
advanced by the Agency that can help governments seeking to implement efficiency
policies rapidly and effectively. This research underpinned a joint statement
that was released following a closed-door ministerial at the conference, in
which 45 government signatories called for stronger policy action towards a
global goal of doubling energy efficiency progress this decade. The Versailles
Statement is  available here . To download the full versions of all of these
