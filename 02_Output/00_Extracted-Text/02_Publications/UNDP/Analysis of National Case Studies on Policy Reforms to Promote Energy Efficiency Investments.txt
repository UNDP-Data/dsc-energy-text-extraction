978-92-1-057517-1 ISSN 1014-7225 This publication is prepared in the framework
of the United Nations Development Account project “Promoting Energy Efficiency
Investments for Climate Change Mitigation and Sustainable Development”, which is
implemented jointly by all five UN Regional Commissions with UNECE as the lead
agency. It aims to identify existing barriers to energy efficiency policy
implementation and to provide recommendations to the policy makers that would
assist them in development and implementation of policy reforms that can support
market formation and foster favourable climate for investments in energy
efficiency. The publication develops a benchmark that should serve as a
reference point for policy makers and energy experts working in the field of
energy efficiency. This benchmark is a synthesis of policy incentives that
should be in place in order to stimulate and ensure successful energy efficiency
policy outcomes. The desired policies are divided into three groups: 1) legal,
institutional and regulatory; 2) economic and financial; and 3) sociopolitical.
A set of these policies in place at a sufficient degree in a particular country
is a basis for successful formulation and implementation of energy efficiency
policies and related projects.  ABOUT UNECE Mission Executive Secretary
