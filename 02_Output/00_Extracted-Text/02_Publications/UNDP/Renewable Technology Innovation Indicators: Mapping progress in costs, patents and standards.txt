Clean energy technology innovation and research, development and demonstration
(RD&D) plays a critical role in accelerating the global energy transition. IRENA
has, for the first time, collected data on a range of quantitative innovation
indicators on the costs and performance of renewable technologies, patents and
standards; that provide a quantitative measure of innovation progress. These
indicators of innovation ‘outputs’ ( i.e . new or improved technologies,
processes and systems with lower costs), based on a methodology specifically
created for the purpose, provide both qualitative and quantitative insights into
the ways in which seven renewable energy technologies have progressed through
time, either fully or in part due to RD&D activities. This is a valuable
resource for policy makers and researchers, given that the principal focus to
date has been on gathering data on inputs into the innovation process (e.g. R&D
expenditure). The metrics collected by IRENA open up the possibility of a much
more rigorous comparative analysis of the relative performance of innovation
support for different technologies. This could be a crucial support to policy
makers, as insights from past experience can help inform innovation policy for
the next round of technologies that need to be scaled up. The report is divided
into three sections: In its first section, the report maps  cost and performance
indicators  of seven energy technologies in the past ten years. It looks at
solar PV, concentrating solar power, behind-the-meter batteries, onshore wind
and offshore wind, hydrogen elecrolysers and large-scale solar thermal.     In
its second section, the report dives deeper into the past 10 years of progress
in offshore wind and hydrogen through the lens of  patents and standards data .
The visualisation of data is available in  INSPIRE dashboard . In its third
section, the case study that combined all the indicators to holistically assess
innovation progress is discussed based on the pilot analysis for offshore wind
technologies. More detail on this is contained in the report  Tracking the
Impacts of Innovation: Offshore wind as a case study  (June 2021). This work was
supported by the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation
programme (grant agreement no. 899899). The project also contributes to the
Mission Innovation Insights module . In addition to the report, data dashboards
on the cost and performance metrics are available for:   solar PV concentrating
solar power   behind-the-meter batteries   onshore wind   offshore wind
hydrogen elecrolysers   Additional analyses
