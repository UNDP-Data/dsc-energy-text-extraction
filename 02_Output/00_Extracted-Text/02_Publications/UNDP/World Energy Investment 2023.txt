About this report This year’s edition of the World Energy Investment provides a
full update on the investment picture in 2022 and an initial reading of the
emerging picture for 2023. The report provides a global benchmark for tracking
capital flows in the energy sector and examines how investors are assessing
risks and opportunities across all areas of fuel and electricity supply,
critical minerals, efficiency, research and development and energy finance. It
focuses on some important features of the new investment landscape that are
already visible, including the policies now in place that reinforce incentives
for clean energy spending, the energy security lens through which many
investments are now viewed, widespread cost and inflationary pressures, the
major boost in revenues that high fuel prices are bringing to traditional
suppliers, and burgeoning expectations in many countries that investments will
be aligned with solutions to the climate crisis. This report is part of the
IEA’s support of the first global stocktake of the Paris Agreement, which will
be finalized in the run up to COP28, the next UN Climate Change Conference, at
the end of 2023. Find other reports in this series on the IEA’s  Global Energy
Transitions Stocktake  page. This work was supported by the  Clean Energy
Transitions Programme , the IEA’s flagship initiative to transform the world’s
energy system to achieve a secure and sustainable future for all . Published May
