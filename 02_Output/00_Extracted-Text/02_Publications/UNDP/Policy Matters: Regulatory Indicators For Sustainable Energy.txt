December 7 2018 AUTHOR(S) ESMAP   Policy Matters: Regulatory Indicators For
Sustainable Energy RISE 2018 charts global progress on sustainable energy
policies and shows that policies matter – they are a leading indicator and
building block of the world’s transition to sustainable energy. The report finds
that the world has seen a huge uptake in sustainable energy policies. However,
progress is still far from  where it needs to be for the world to reach global
climate goals and the Sustainable Development Goal on Energy (SDG7). RISE 2018
rates 133 countries from 2010-17 on electricity access, renewable energy, energy
efficiency and access to clean cooking to provide useful data to policymakers
and help the private sector make informed decisions about investing in energy
projects. RISE 2018 is the second edition of RISE first released in 2016. As
such, it follows the previous methodology of classifying countries into a green
zone of strong performers in the top third, a yellow zone of middling
performers, and a red zone of weaker performers in the bottom third. It also
incorporates new features including policy time trends since 2010; a greater
emphasis on tracking policies that support enforcement; broader coverage of the
heating and transport sectors; and a pilot assessment of the policy environment
for clean cooking in a dozen large access-deficit countries. Press release  |
