About this report The International Energy Agency prepared this report, within
the framework of a  Global Environment Facility  (GEF) programme aimed at
supporting low- and middle-income economies in their transition to E-mobility.
It is the first deliverable of Working Group Four on Charging, Grid Integration,
Renewable Power Supply and Battery Re-use, Recycling and Safe Disposal. Its
objective is to provide policy makers with a comprehensive overview of the
ecosystem of public charging infrastructure (defined as infrastructure that is
publicly accessible), as well as key recommendations for its efficient
deployment. Although it focuses on charging systems for light-duty vehicles, the
report also discusses implications for two- and three-wheelers, as well as
heavy-duty vehicles. The findings summarised here are informed by the many
contributions and insights provided by international stakeholders. The IEA’s
analysis begins with a definition of charging infrastructure and describes the
different business models associated with it. We present a number of policy
examples and conclude with five key recommendations for ensuring the efficient
roll-out of public charging infrastructure.  Published April 2022 License CC BY
