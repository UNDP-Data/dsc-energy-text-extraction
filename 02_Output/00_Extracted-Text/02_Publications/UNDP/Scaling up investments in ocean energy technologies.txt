brief from the Collaborative Framework for Ocean Energy Technologies and
Offshore Renewables provides options for scaling up investments in ocean energy,
focusing on tidal stream and wave energy technologies.

investments in ocean energy technologies   Newsletter    Go Among the broad
range of renewable energy options available within the global energy transition,
ocean energy offers significant potential to support decarbonisation efforts.
With a global market potential of 350 GW by 2050, ocean energy can provide
clean, local, predictable electricity to coastal nations and islands around the
world. Ocean energy technologies can also interact in a symbiotic way with the
blue economy; contribute to climate change mitigation; create new employment
opportunities; and support overall grid resilience. Despite their potential,
ocean energy technologies face recurring challenges to their deployment,
including a lack of funding opportunities and market visibility. This brief,
produced by IRENA and Ocean Energy Europe (OEE) under the  Collaborative
Framework for Ocean Energy Technologies and Offshore Renewables , presents
practical recommendations for scaling up investments in tidal stream and wave
technologies – as the sub-categories within ocean energy that are closest to
maturity, have the greatest application potential globally and are the most
scalable.   Related content                                  North Africa's
