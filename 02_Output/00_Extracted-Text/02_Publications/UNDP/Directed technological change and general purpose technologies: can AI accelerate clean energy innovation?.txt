paper-378_Andres-Dugoua-Dumas-0 (PDF)﻿ AI green patents - supplementary material
(PDF)﻿ The race between clean and dirty technologies is taking place against the
backdrop of improvements in general-purpose technologies such as information and
communication technologies (ICT) and artificial intelligence (AI). In this
paper, the authors show how, in theory, a general-purpose technology can affect
the direction of technological change and, in particular, the competition
between clean and dirty technologies. Using patent data from the electricity and
transport sectors, they show that clean technologies use and benefit more from
AI and ICT knowledge than dirty technologies do and that energy patenting firms
with higher AI knowledge stocks are more likely to absorb new AI knowledge for
their energy inventions. The authors conclude that ICT and AI have the potential
to accelerate clean energy innovation, which is critical for reducing carbon
emissions.  Key points for decision-makers  The authors study the impact of
information and communication technologies (ICT) and artificial intelligence
(AI) as key ‘General-Purpose Technologies’ (GPTs) on clean energy innovation. 
They argue that theoretically, GPTs can help clean technologies compete with
dirty technologies and could make new technologies more attractive for R&D
investments. If inventors start preferring clean technologies, they will put
more effort into applying the GPT to it, which in turn increases the
technology’s productivity, further encouraging innovators to focus on it.  Some
ICT and AI technologies may have applications essential for the transition to
clean energy – such as smart grids facilitating the integration of distributed
renewable energy with bulk power generation plants and bulk energy storage
systems, and smart buildings benefitting from effective load demand forecasting
and better monitoring through smart meters.   However, given the wide range of
applications for AI, it could also help the productivity of dirty technologies
(i.e., conventional, highly polluting technologies) and prolong their
attractiveness.  The authors use patent data to show the extent to which clean
and dirty technologies have incorporated advances in AI and ICT (or have
‘absorbed spillovers’) over the last two decades and find that, particularly for
AI since 2010, clean inventions consistently incorporate or absorb more.    The
results can help inform energy policy. Because the empirical analysis shows that
firms are an essential locus for knowledge spillovers between the GPT and energy
applications, increasing the development of firm-level capabilities in both
digital and low-carbon technologies is likely worthwhile.
