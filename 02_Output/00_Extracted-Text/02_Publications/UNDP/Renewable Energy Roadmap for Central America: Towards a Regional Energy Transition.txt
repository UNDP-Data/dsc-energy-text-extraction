Energy Roadmap for Central America: Towards a Regional Energy Transition
Newsletter    Go También disponible en  Español Central America is entering a
crucial decade for shaping its future energy system and is strongly engaged in
the energy transition. Although the contribution by the Central American
countries to the global CO 2  emissions in 2018 was just of 0.2%, the region
still expects to experience adverse climate effects such as shifts in
precipitation patterns and average temperature rise.  The  Renewable Energy
Roadmap for Central America  provides a comprehensive pathway for the
development of a sustainable and cleaner regional energy system. It explores the
role of end-use sectors electrification, the feasible expansion of renewable
generation, energy efficiency solutions as well the importance of expanding the
existing regional power sector integration.  Specific sector technological
pathways and investment opportunities and tailor actions are important outcomes
that will enrich the regional debate and help accelerate the energy
transformation. The main areas of action that were identified and that are
further explored in the report are: Renewables expansion in electricity
generation Interconnection expansion Sustainable mobility adoption Fostering of
modern cooking technologies Promotion of energy efficiency Additionally, a Power
BI dashboard can be accessed to explore country specific and regional inputs and
results of the REmap and Flextool analysis in 2018, 2030 and 2050. The content
targets energy analysts, policy makers and other stakeholders in the energy
sector interested in understanding the data behind the results of this study.
