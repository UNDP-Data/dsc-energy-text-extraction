Decentralised Solar Electricity for Agri-food Value Chains in the Hindu Kush

The communities inhabiting the mountainous areas of the Hind Kush Himalaya (HKH)
region, which rely mainly on agriculture and farming for their food security and
livelihoods, face increasingly severe impacts from climate change. Access to
reliable and affordable energy is a key infrastructure input to improve
agricultural productivity, reduce losses and capture value creation
opportunities through processing and enhanced market access.  This report seeks
to identify viable decentralised solar PV solutions to power key food value
chains that are common across all eight countries of the HKH region –
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan. It
assesses the viability of solar PV solutions to meet energy needs at different
nodal points in four selected food value chains of economic importance across
the high-altitude areas of these countries, namely buckwheat, yak milk, potato
and other vegetables.  The solar PV-based solutions suggested here have been
designed based on proof-of-concept, deployed systems for similar farming
processes. The viable mechanised equipment required to automate the production
processes for each of the four food value chains have been discussed and
presented based on their techno-commercial viability.    Additional analyses
