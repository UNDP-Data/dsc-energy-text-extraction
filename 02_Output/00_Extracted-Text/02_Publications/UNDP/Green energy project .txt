panel system at the Nadella Waste Management Centre is capable of generating
13,500 kilowatts of clean energy.   Ashwa Faheem/UNDP Maldives       The Green
Energy Project has installed a 12-kilowatt solar panel system at the Nadella
Waste Management Centre, aiming to end the burning of fossil fuels by converting
the energy used at the centre into renewable energy, in turn cutting down cost
of energy and electricity.  An energy audit was also conducted, according to
which 2.37 tonnes of carbon released into the atmosphere per annum can be
reduced under the project, saving approximately Rf 65,6541 in oil costs,
providing socio-economic relief to the island.  The system is also capable of
generating 13,500 kilowatts of clean energy.       Advocacy and awareness
sessions about renewable energy were held for the students at Nadella School,
and certificates were awarded at the closing ceremony.   Ashwa Faheem/UNDP
