solutions in end-uses: Heat pump costs and markets   Newsletter    Go If the
world is to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, policy makers must address
the challenges of reducing energy use and increasing the share of renewable
energy in end-use sectors. Globally, the buildings sector accounts for around
three gigatonnes (Gt) of direct carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions per year, with
electricity use and associated fossil fuel combustion for district heating
raising that figure to 10 Gt of CO 2  per year. Electrically-driven heat pumps
represent a solution that can increase the share of electrification in buildings
while also dramatically improving the efficiency of energy use for space and
water heating - the largest sources of energy use in temperate and cold
climates. However, data on the costs and performance of heat pumps has not been
widely available to policy makers, researchers or other stakeholders. See the
visual story:  Solutions for Decarbonising Heating in Buildings This report
seeks to remedy that knowledge gap and support better informed decisions
concerning the role of heat pumps. It provides an overview of heat pump
technologies and their applications; discusses building stock and the
implications for the use of heat pumps in both new and old buildings; examines
recent market developments and the acceleration in heat pump deployment –
particularly in Europe; and offers a detailed review of cost and performance
trends for heat pumps by technology, system size and - in some cases - dwelling
type.   Additional analyses                                Renewable Power
