23 About this report With the world in the midst of the first global energy
crisis – triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine – the  World Energy Outlook
2022 (WEO)  provides indispensable analysis and insights on the implications of
this profound and ongoing shock to energy systems across the globe. Based on the
latest energy data and market developments, this year’s  WEO  explores key
questions about the crisis: Will it be a setback for clean energy transitions or
a catalyst for greater action? How might government responses shape energy
markets? Which energy security risks lie ahead on the path to net zero
emissions? The  WEO  is the energy world’s most authoritative source of analysis
and projections. This flagship publication of the IEA has appeared every year
since 1998. Its objective data and dispassionate analysis provide critical
insights into global energy supply and demand in different scenarios and the
implications for energy security, climate targets and economic development.
