Limitations of Marginal Pricing for a Power System Based on Renewables
Marginal pricing wholesale power markets could produce significant barriers for

Browse by theme               Marginal pricing wholesale power markets could
produce significant barriers for the energy transition, and on their own do not
appear to be appropriate organisational structures for renewables-based power
systems. Besides the well-known cannibalisation and merit order effects
(depressing renewable generator revenues as the transition advances), under a
marginal pricing-based power system organisational structure, the high
difference in marginal costs of the technologies needed to operate a renewables-
based power system (bulk renewable generation and flexibility) may lead to
socio-political instabilities such as those experienced during 2022 as a
consequence of high natural gas prices. A way to prevent the misalignments and
transition barriers explored in this Technical paper is to change the power
system organisational structure in such a way that it honours the different
techno-economic characteristics of both bulk renewable electricity generation
and flexibility. IRENA’s dual procurement proposal is an example of such an
organisational structure. Marginal pricing can still play a role but with its
scope limited to the procurement of flexibility.   Additional analyses
