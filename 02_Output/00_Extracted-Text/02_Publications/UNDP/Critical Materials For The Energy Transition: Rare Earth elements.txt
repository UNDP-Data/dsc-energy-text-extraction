Rare Earth elements      The technical paper on Critical Materials for the
Energy Transition emphasises that an accelerated energy transition requires a
growing supply of critical materials, with Chapter 7 of the IRENA’s World Energy
Transition Outlook 2022 further elaborating on these materials. IRENA continues
to publish technical papers on groups of critical materials: the first one
focuses on lithium and this second paper focuses on rare earth elements.

Browse by theme               The technical paper on  Critical Materials for the
Energy Transition  emphasises that an accelerated energy transition requires a
growing supply of critical materials, with Chapter 7 of the IRENA’s  World
Energy Transition Outlook 2022  further elaborating on these materials. IRENA
continues to publish technical papers on groups of critical materials: the first
one focuses on lithium and this second paper focuses on rare earth elements. The
rare earths are a group of 17 chemical elements, several of which are critical
for the energy transition. While conventional energy also relies on rare earths,
the mix of energy-relevant rare earths that are needed going forward differs
from the past. This technical paper examines demand and market growth
projections for electric vehicles and wind turbines and explores the efficiency
of rare earths’ use. It pays special attention to patent activity in magnets
around the world. On the supply side, it explores: the outlook for the mining
and processing of rare earths; current costs and their implications; and
approaches to enhance the security of rare earth elements supply. The paper also
delves deeper into the opportunities that innovation can play in reducing
dependency on rare earths and discusses related policy implications.
