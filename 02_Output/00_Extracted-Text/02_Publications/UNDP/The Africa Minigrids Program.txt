minigrids, active in an initial 18 African countries. AMP is expressly targeting
early-stage minigrid markets, seeking to establish the enabling environment for
subsequent private investment at scale. With GEF funding, the United Nations
Development Programme will be implementing the program together with Rocky
Mountain Institute (RMI) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), linking up
with a wide array of minigrid stakeholders in Africa and beyond. GEF Updates
