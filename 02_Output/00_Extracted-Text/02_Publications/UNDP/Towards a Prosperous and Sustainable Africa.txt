Gains of Africa’s Energy Transition Download the  Executive Summary   The next
ten years will be key for sustainable development in Africa. As Africa is
considered most vulnerable to climate change, African governments, supported by
the international community, must define new pathways to sustainable prosperity.
The best way forward is to adopt and implement changes that can help climate
goals and find solutions that simultaneously enhance equality, justice, and
social inclusion. As joint authors of this report, RES4AFRICA, IRENA and UNECA
call for enhanced co-operation among countries, public and private sectors, and
the international community to accelerate sustainable development goals in
Africa and support a just and inclusive energy transition. IRENA’s analysis of
socio-economic impacts presented in this report shows that Africa will be better
off, across multiple dimensions, if the more ambitious 1.5°C Scenario route is
pursued. Led by government spending, gross domestic product will be higher by an
average of 6.4% to 2050 than in the Planned Energy Scenario. Similarly, economy-
wide employment is 3.5% higher on average in the 1.5°C Scenario compared to the
Planned Energy Scenario. The energy sector will have at least 28 million jobs in
2050, with renewable energy jobs rising from more than 0.3 million today to 8
million by 2050. The five welfare dimensions analysed – economic, social,
environmental, distributional, and access – perform better under the 1.5°C
Scenario. Achieving sustainable energy transitions in Africa and maximising
socio-economic benefits and value creation will require a systematic approach.
To succeed in this effort, co-ordinated and well-defined actions are needed at
three levels. Actions at the  macro-environment level : Integrate inclusiveness
and social justice principles in the definition of energy strategies to leave no
one behind. Establish sound governance and capacitate institutions to deliver on
inclusive energy transition and sustainable development goals. Align energy
infrastructure development planning to socio-economic development agendas and
priorities. Define and create appropriate multi-stakeholder consultative
platforms and partnerships for policy definition and target implementation
Reinforce investments in the social infrastructure needed to deliver on
sustainable economic and energy transition priorities. Enhance public awareness
about the benefits of green industrialisation to build social support and
acceptance. Actions at the  industry value chain level : Leverage South-South
economic and industrial integration to build competitive African supply chains
and manufacturing capacities. Scale up investments in science, technology,
research, and innovation to promote sustainable technology uptake and local
production. Set up smart local content regulations to support local value
creation opportunities aligned with national competitive advantages. Reinforce
technical and vocational training programmes to build the skillsets required to
develop energy transition sectors. Actions at the  business environment level :
Expand the innovative project and corporate financing schemes, such as green
bonds, to increase capital availability for sustainable and impactful projects.
Increase the participation of domestic financing and local financial
institutions in support of sustainable energy projects. Expand the availability
and accessibility of de-risking tools and products to decrease the cost of
capital for sustainable projects. Improve the openness, attractiveness, and
readiness of electricity markets through fit-for-purpose policies and regulatory
reforms and improvements. Redirect public support such as incentives and
subsidies to sustain fragile populations and sustainable energy consumption
behaviours.   Additional analyses                                North Africa:
