September 30 2021 AUTHOR(S) ESMAP/IFC   Key Factors for Successful Development
of Offshore Wind in Emerging Markets Offshore wind holds tremendous promise for
many emerging markets as a large-scale, clean, reliable form of new electricity
generation with the potential to stimulate valuable economic benefits. However,
developing a new offshore wind sector in an emerging market is no easy task.
Decision makers must strike a careful balance as they consider a range of
technical, political, environmental, and social challenges.  The report,
developed by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP),  is a
publication of the World Bank Group’s Offshore Wind Development Program led by
ESMAP in partnership with the International Financing Corporation (IFC),  which
looks at offshore wind development as a potential source of renewable energy.  
The  Offshore Wind Development Program was established in 2019  with the aim of
accelerating the uptake of offshore wind in emerging markets by supporting the
inclusion of offshore wind into the energy sector policies and strategies of
World Bank Group client countries and the preparatory work needed to build a
pipeline of bankable projects.   Video   Citation Washington, D.C. : World

Wind To Emerging Markets For many years, offshore wind was the expensive cousin
of onshore wind with generation costs in the range of $150 to $200 per megawatt
hour (MWh). This changed dramatically between 2016 and 2017 when… October 31
