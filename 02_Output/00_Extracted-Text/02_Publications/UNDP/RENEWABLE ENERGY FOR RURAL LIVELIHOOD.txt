Summary Renewable Energy for Rural Livelihood (RERL) is a joint project of
Government of Nepal (GoN) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The
project has been operational since 2011 after the closure of Rural Energy
Development Programme (REDP) with the main objective of supporting Alternative
Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC) to scaleup renewable energy project
implementation. Since 2019, RERL has also been providing technical support to
AEPC to implement South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) funded by
Asian Development Bank (ADB) to install 4.3MW mini hydropower projects and  
0.5MW solar/solar wind hybrid mini grids in off-grid areas of Nepal. 
Background Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC) has been implementing the
off-grid energy component of the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation
(SASEC) project since 2015 for a period up to 2021, designed to be implemented
with financial assistance of ADB and technical assistance (TA) of AEPC’s
National Rural and Renewable Energy Programme (NRREP). However, with the phasing
out of NRREP in mid-2017, AEPC initiated the implementation of the SASEC project
through its GEF-UNDP funded RERL As both SASEC and RERL had been working closely
for meeting the physical targets of both the projects under complementarity
approach,  AEPC and UNDP agreed to continue RERL TA for implementation of SASEC
Subprojects in March 2020. The TA primarily focuses on community mobilization,
institution establishment and strengthening, construction supervision,
productive energy end use (PEU) promotion and capacity development for smooth
operation and management. RERL is working in 9 mini hydropower projects and 9
solar or solar-wind hybrid mini grids in different parts of the country.
Major Achievements Completed construction of 9 Solar/Solar Wind Hybrid Mini Grid
(SMG) with total capacity of 565kW which provides electricity access to 1,632
households of which 127 are women headed and 971 belong to disadvantaged groups
(DAG) as defined by GoN. Completed construction of 3 Mini Hydropower Projects
with total capacity of 600kW providing electricity access to 2,703 rural
households. 2645 community people of whom 49% are women, received different
trainings and capacity development support Out of 157 executive members of
cooperatives/users’ groups involved in development/operation of RE projects, 31%
are women.   Supported to establish 380 enterprises, out of which 155 of 41% are
women led and provide employment to 561 people of whom 258 or 46% are women.
9 Solar/Solar Wind Hybrid         Mini Grid constructed providing electricity
access to 1,632 households               3 Mini Hydropower         Projects
constructed providing electricity access to 2,703 rural households.
390 enterprises         established in solar mini grids
GESI Component The project has been mainstreaming GESI at every steps. GESI
Action Plan of RERL has been implemented in all stages of the mini hydro cycle
which requires 30% participation of women in decision making bodies and 30%
participants in capacity development activities. So far 35% women in their
Executive Committees both in solar mini grid (SMG) and mini hydro (MHP)
projects. In addition, the project helps identify potential enterprises that can
engage women in the communities where MHP and SMG are operational. As of now,
women and members of marginalized communities were encouraged to engage in
regular saving and credit schemes and over 3000 women are involved in 200 groups
which is more than 91% of the total members.  Furthermore, project requires
electricity access to 30,500 households out of which 30% have to be from
marginalized groups such as female headed, below poverty line and disadvantaged
groups as defined by the GoN. As the energy projects built under RERL are
located at remote off-grid areas, most of the households fall within the
aforementioned three categories. Out of 21,409 households served by the 9
completed SMGs or 7 MHPs that are completed, under construction or planned to be
initiated soon, 12% are women headed, 53% belong to DAG and 18% belong to BPL.
The project has provided cooperative management, financial literacy, social
mobilization, basic accounting and enterprise development trainings for 2,073
members of cooperatives of whom 1,534 were women which is 61% of the total
participants.  Women are supported to access additional fund based on AEPC
subsidy policy and delivery mechanism. Further, women are also supported on
skill development, book-keeping and financial management, access to finance and
other services necessary to establish and operate businesses. So far, RERL has
supported to establish 380 enterprises out of mainly in SMG projects, out of
which 155 or 41% are women led and provide employment to 561 people of whom 258
or 46% are women.   Related Materials      FAQ       Project details: Project
