Power Plant in Cyprus                       First steps for a Bicommunal Solar
Power Plant in Cyprus   July 5, 2023           The European Commission together
with UNDP Cyprus has launched an EU-funded study for a bicommunal solar power
plant in Cyprus, which will be carried out by a renowned company from Germany.
Funded by the Commission's Aid Programme for the Turkish Cypriot community with
EUR 325,000 and managed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), this
study is an important step in building a more integrated and sustainable
electricity system in Cyprus. It is expected to foster cooperation between the
two communities of the island, while supporting the objectives of the European
Green Deal. Experts appointed by each Cypriot community will also participate in
the study. The study will assess the technical, regulatory, environmental,
economic, and financial aspects of the project. It will identify suitable
locations in the buffer zone and explore the most promising technical options,
including energy storage capacity, for a 30-50 MW solar power plant capacity - a
significant leap towards a greener and more sustainable energy landscape in
Cyprus. The results of the study will be finalised towards the end of the year
and provide insights and recommendations for the future development of the
bicommunal power plant.      News International Day of Peace Run 2023  Read more
