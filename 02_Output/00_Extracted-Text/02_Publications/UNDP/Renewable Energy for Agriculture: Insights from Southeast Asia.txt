agriculture sector is a key economic sector in Southeast Asia and an important
driver of socio-economic development, supporting the livelihoods of a
significant share of the region’s population. Access to modern, reliable and
affordable energy is vital to enable growth in the sector; at each step of the
value chain, energy helps to increase yields, add value, reduce losses and
improve market access. Through detailed case studies, this brief examines the
role of renewables in meeting growing energy needs in the agriculture sector in
an inclusive and environmentally sustainable manner, with a specific focus on
meeting heating/cooling needs, given that this end-use sector is often
overlooked in conventional discussions on the energy transition. Key actions to
scale up the use of renewables in the agriculture sector include:  the need to
follow a value chain approach to identify high-impact renewable energy
opportunities;  developing targets and strategies for heating/cooling
applications;  strengthening cross-sector planning and partnerships;  designing
financing products for end-users, enterprises and ecosystem actors; facilitating
technology innovation and piloting; and emphasising inclusivity in programme
design and implementation.   Additional analyses
