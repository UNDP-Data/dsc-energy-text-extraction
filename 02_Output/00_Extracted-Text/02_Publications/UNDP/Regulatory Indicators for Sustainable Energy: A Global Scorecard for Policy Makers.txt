Regulatory Indicators for Sustainable Energy: A Global Scorecard for Policy
Makers Energy is at the forefront of the development agenda. Recognizing
energy's vital role in development and prosperity, the world has committed to
Sustainable Development Goal 7 to "Ensure access to affordable, reliable,
sustainable and modern energy for all" as one of 17 goals for 2030, as well as
to dramatically increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. The
historic climate change agreement in Paris in 2015 also draws attention to the
essential scale-up of clean energy to attain a 2 degrees C° world, with energy
featuring prominently in many countries' Nationally Determined Contributions.
Achieving these global energy goals calls for more than a trillion dollars of
investment annually. Reaching the 2030 targets set by Sustainable Energy for All
(SEforALL) - universal access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, doubling
the rate of improvement of energy efficiency, and doubling the share of
renewable energy - requires an unprecedented scale-up of both public and private
finance. Investment in sustainable energy is affected by many factors, including
market size, country risk, and financial markets, to name but a few. But a
country's policies and regulations also matter, and they are directly under the
control of government. This report—based on a new and comprehensive global
policy scorecard called Regulatory Indicators for Sustainable Energy (RISE) -
answers two important questions. Are policy makers around the world truly rising
to the challenge posed by the new global sustainable energy agenda? Where is
further action most critically needed? Related content Press Release  |  RISE
