English العربية Locations                   Project Summary       The project
intends to address the lack of access to energy in health facilities as well as
the lack of income opportunities for women and youth. In addition, the project
interventions will provide support to improving the access to health services
and livelihoods overall. The overall objective of the project is to contribute
to reduced energy poverty and strengthened resilience capacity of conflict
affected communities through improved health services and sustainable
livelihoods. The project would be implemented in Aden, Lahj, Abyan, Sana’a and
Hajjah governorates, and is expected to reach approximately 205,000 individuals
(106,600 men and 98,400 women). The overall objective of the project is to
contribute to reduced energy poverty and strengthened resilience capacity of
conflict affected  communities through improved health services and sustainable
livelihood. Gender Empowerment  Yemen ranks last on the global gender index, and
ongoing crises have disrupted traditional gender roles for both men and women.
As a result, women are now permitted to engage in economic activities. The
project aims to promote economic and empowerment models for women and youth
through the use of solar micro-grids. Groups of women in selected districts,
will operate a solar micro-grid station that will gain significant community
support.  The micro-grid will also provide women (38% of recipients) with
employment and income earning opportunities, allowing them to meet their
household needs. Lessons learned from the successful operation of the micro-grid
station in 4 governorates (Sana’a, Hajja. Lahj, Abyan and Aden (will be applied
to the proposed scaling initiative.          Expected Outputs          Output 1
: Targeted hospitals have improved access to energy in sustainable manner and
resumed critical facilities and services Output  2: Targeted women and youth
have access to sustained income opportunities through solar micro-grid supported
expenditure for health, medicine and care.         Related Materials Emergency
