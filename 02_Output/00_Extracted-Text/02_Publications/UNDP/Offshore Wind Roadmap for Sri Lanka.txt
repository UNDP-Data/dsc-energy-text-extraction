25 2023 AUTHOR(S)   Offshore Wind Roadmap for Sri Lanka     About the Roadmap
The Government of Sri Lanka has set a goal to have 70% of its electricity
generated by renewable energy sources by  2030, and  achieve carbon neutrality
in electricity generation by 2050.  A currently untapped resource for the
country that can help achieve these goals is offshore wind.     Sri Lanka has
significant potential for offshore wind, and there is already private sector
interest in developing projects. The additional clean energy capacity that could
be generated by offshore wind can not only support the country’s transition to
net zero carbon, but also increase security of supply and help reduce the
economic burden from fossil fuel imports.     To fully assess the country’s
offshore wind potential, the Government of Sri Lanka commissioned a roadmap
published by the World Bank Group under its Offshore Wind Development Program.
The  Offshore Wind Roadmap for Sri Lanka , funded by the World Bank Energy
Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and PROBLUE, provides a full
overview of potential low and high growth scenarios for offshore wind
development in the country, as well as a series of recommendations for the
government to take  in order to  realize these scenarios.     The objective of
this roadmap is to provide strategic analysis and advice on the role that
offshore wind can play in Sri Lanka’s future energy mix, analysis on the key
opportunities and challenges, and recommendations on next steps in terms of
policy formulation, planning, and developing bankable projects. This report is
comprised of main body (chapters 2 to 6), which summarize the key findings and
conclusions of this report, as well as presenting the roadmap. Chapters 7 to 15
present more detailed analysis of the themes of this report.     Watch the
