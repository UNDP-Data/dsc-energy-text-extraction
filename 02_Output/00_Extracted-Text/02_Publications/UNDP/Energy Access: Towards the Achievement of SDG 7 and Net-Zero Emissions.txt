SDG 7 and Net-Zero Emissions Energy can create transformational opportunities.
For the 759 million people in the world who lack  access to electricity, the
introduction of clean energy solutions can bring vital services such as 
improved healthcare, better education and affordable broadband, creating new
jobs, livelihoods and  sustainable economic value to reduce poverty. In regions
such as sub-Saharan Africa where half of  secondary schools and a quarter of
health facilities have no power, clean energy access will help save  lives, and
offer opportunities for prosperity at a transformative scale. An energy
revolution based on renewables and energy efficiency is urgently needed not just
to accelerate economic progress and development, but also to slash emissions
that are rapidly warming our planet. To generate the vital momentum needed for
this transition, the UN Secretary-General is convening the  High-Level Dialogue
on Energy in September 2021, the first such meeting in 40 years. The landmark 
event will offer a global stage for countries to attract new investments and
forge new impact focused  partnerships to drive forward this energy revolution.
The report was prepared based on a series of interactive meetings of the TWG,
which were chaired by the Co-leads, to discuss draft versions in the period of
February to May 2021.  As a foundation for informed deliberations, five
Technical Working Groups were established on the five key themes of the High-
level Dialogue: (1) Energy Access, (2) Energy Transitions, (3) Enabling SDGs
through Inclusive, Just Energy Transitions, (4) Innovation, Technology and Data,
and (5) Finance and Investment. These Technical Working Groups brought together
leading experts on these subjects from across the world to identify key
recommendations for a global roadmap towards the achievement of SDG7 and the
climate objectives of the Paris Agreement. Citation For further information,
