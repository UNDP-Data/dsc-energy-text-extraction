markets to high-efficiency LED lighting and high-efficiency distribution
transformers                 Leapfrogging South Africa’s markets to high-
efficiency LED lighting and high-efficiency distribution transformers
The Leapfrogging South Africa’s markets to high-efficiency LED lighting and
high-efficiency distribution transformers project is designed to advance the
country’s transition towards a low-carbon economy through the adoption of high-
energy efficiency technology. The project aims to achieve this energy efficiency
potential and curtail consumption of (coal-fired) electricity and associated
global environmental impact from appliances and equipment. The transition to an
economy using high-efficiency lighting and distribution transformers is hindered
by the persistence of barriers and challenges that limit the market penetration
of high-efficiency lighting and distribution transformers. 
Expand the availability of high-quality household appliances (specifically high-
efficiency lighting), high-efficiency distribution transformers, as well as
open, accurate market information via national standards, product labelling,
testing and certification, and promotional outreach.         Related Materials
