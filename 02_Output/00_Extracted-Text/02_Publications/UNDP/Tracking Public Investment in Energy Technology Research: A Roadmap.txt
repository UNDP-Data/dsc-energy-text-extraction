About this report A wide range of countries make efforts to track their entire
national public energy research, development and demonstration (RD&D) activity
on an ongoing basis, also sharing the collected data with the IEA through a
standardised template. However, the approaches adopted to collect data vary
significantly across countries.  This roadmap describes the variety of country
approaches, also identifying the most important common components: the
institutional arrangements; the methods for collecting, classifying and
validating the data; the data management and technology processes; and, finally,
the dissemination. It is intended not only as a guide for countries near the
beginning of their journeys towards the collection of energy RD&D, but also for
countries with more advanced systems looking to strengthen specific areas.  The
roadmap is the product of interviews held with representatives of 20 governments
between November 2021 and March 2022, and it is indebted to their generosity in
sharing their experiences with tracking national energy RD&D spending. Case
studies based on the interviews are used to highlight noteworthy methods, while
complete national systems descriptions are included in the annex. It is hoped
that this publication will serve as a reference and inspiration for experts in
this important area of tracking clean energy transitions and that new
experiences can be added in the future. Published September 2022 License CC BY
