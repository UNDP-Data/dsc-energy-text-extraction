Women and UNIDO have joined forces to produce this guide on “Gender equality in
the sustainable energy transition”, which provides an overview of key and
emerging issues in the  gender and sustainable energy nexus , illustrated by
research findings and case studies. This guide has been drafted with a view to
supporting policymakers and development practitioners in government, the private
sector, and civil society, as well as in the UN system, who are involved in
designing and implementing sustainable energy policies, programmes, and
projects. The guide builds on the recommendations of a previous joint
publication from 2013,  “Sustainable energy for all: The gender dimensions” ,
while reflecting global trends and challenges that have taken centre stage in
the years since, including the impacts on gender and energy of the COVID-19
pandemic and the war in Ukraine, unsustainable patterns of consumption and
production, and one of today’s greatest environmental and development
challenges: climate change. Additional documents Publication (PDF, 2MB)
