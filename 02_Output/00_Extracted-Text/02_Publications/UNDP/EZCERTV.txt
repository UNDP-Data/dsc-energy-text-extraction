Summary       The low/zero carbon development of rural towns and villages is
based on the improved development and utilization of renewable energy resources,
adopting renewable energy technologies, integrated energy management and energy
efficiency technologies/techniques to meet increasing energy demand and
accelerate rural energy transformation. Low/zero carbon development will
contribute to improve "ecological livability" in China's rural revitalization
strategy, promote the circular economy, and contribute to the achievement of
China's National Determined Contributions (NDCs) targets under the Paris
Agreement. The implementation of the EZCERTV project, in collaboration with
Ministry of  Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA), will contribute to several
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as set by the United Nations General
Assembly. EZCERTV is relevant primarily  to Goal 7: “Ensure access to
affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, but also to Goal
8: “Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and
productive employment and decent work for all”, Goal 11: “Make cities and human
settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”, Goal 13: “Take urgent
action to combat climate change and its impacts by regulating emissions and
promoting developments in renewable energy”, and to a lesser extent to Goal 2:
“End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote
sustainable agriculture”.                   Background     The energy sector in
rural China faces several challenges:   Since rural villages and towns are very
small and scattered throughout the country, energy delivery is very expensive
and at times unreliable. Electric transmission lines incur losses of more than
7%, which is above the accepted European and American standards. On the other
hand, coal is very expensive at over US$ 150/ton, which greatly affects the
rural economy and its development potential. Most households use a combination
of coal, straw and firewood for cooking and domestic heating. Combustion is
often done inefficiently and in an uncontrolled way, causing severe health
consequences because of the release of air pollutants. In addition, the excess
waste biomass generated from agriculture and livestock is disposed of in
landfills, which threatens both soil and water basins. In an effort to improve
their living standards, many rural villages and towns are moving away from the
use of straw and firewood and are switching towards coal, despite its high
price, which would contribute to significantly increasing greenhouse gas
emissions. Renewable Energy (RE) sources and Energy Efficiency (EE) technologies
and measures are barely utilized because of the inadequate local capacity and
awareness about these technologies. These challenges could be overcome by
increasing the utilization of indigenous RE resources, which in rural China
include solar energy, both thermal and photovoltaic, wind energy, geothermal
energy, and biomass. Increasing the use of indigenous RE resources would not
only lead to considerable environmental and economic benefits, but would also
reduce rising concerns over energy security, since China is increasingly
becoming a net energy importer. However, only biomass is utilized to a
significant extent (although very inefficiently) and there are few and small
applications of solar thermal water heaters and solar photovoltaic panels for
public illumination. China’s central government has made great efforts to
promote RE and EE technologies and measures in rural villages and towns, but the
limited educational level and insufficient financial resources available in
rural areas have so far prevented the achievement of the desired results.
        Project Outcome         Formulate policies and institutional mechanisms
on zero carbon town and village development Integrate renewable energy and
energy efficiency technology applications for zero carbon town and village
development Facilitate rural zero carbon development and lifestyle
popularization, and knowledge dissemination                 GESI Component
Although not specifically targeting women groups as key stakeholders or direct
beneficiaries, the project indirectly resulted in the promotion of gender
equality by enhancing women participation.             Related Materials signed
