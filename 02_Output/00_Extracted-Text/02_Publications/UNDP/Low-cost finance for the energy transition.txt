Low-cost finance for the energy transition      This report identifies the
pressing need for greater private sector engagement in the financing of energy
transition projects, as well as closer public-private collaboration to sustain
the net zero pathway.                         ISBN: 978-92-9260-531-5 May 2023

Newsletter    Go The need to scale up the deployment of technologies such as
green hydrogen, energy storage and offshore wind has become increasingly
critical to the success of the global energy transition and to meeting global
climate goals. To this end, access to low-cost capital for project financing in
G20 Member Countries and beyond is vital. However, this remains challenging –
particularly amid the current global tightening of monetary policies – given
that a substantial portion of the necessary investment in energy transition
technologies has yet to be sourced. This report, prepared by the International
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in close collaboration with the Ministry of New
and Renewable Energy (MNRE) of India, aims to facilitate the discussion of this
vital aspect of the transition under India’s G20 Presidency. The report offers
lessons from historical cost reduction trends for solar PV and onshore wind
technologies, enabling innovative frameworks that can adopted to accelerate the
deployment of new and critical low-carbon technologies, and projected investment
requirements for the global energy transition. The report also highlights the
need to mobilise the resources of the private sector, given the limited
resources of the public sector; active private sector engagement is vital,
particularly in offering low-cost capital for financing energy transition
projects. The catalysing role played by the public sector is also discussed in
the context of the need for deeper public-private collaboration on the journey
to a net-zero future. Finally, the report stresses the importance of developing
a better understanding of the key drivers of the cost of capital for different
technologies and markets.   Related content
