This report provides an overview of existing certification schemes and
identifies gaps that will hinder the development of hydrogen certification
across borders, and the associated demand for certificates.

a global hydrogen market: Certification to enable trade   Newsletter    Go As
renewable hydrogen demand increases to meet the need for global decarbonisation,
regions with limited production capacity will need to import renewable hydrogen.
Trade will be developed with regions that possess plentiful renewable energy and
the potential to export hydrogen. International hydrogen trade will therefore
require a certification system to identify the various forms of hydrogen, their
associated carbon footprints and other sustainability criteria.  None of the
existing hydrogen certification systems are suitable for cross-border trade;
gaps in design, standards and ecolabelling, for instance, mean that certificates
provide insufficient information to allow fair comparison across borders.
Therefore, standardisation and harmonisation are needed in these areas, as well
as in greenhouse gas footprint calculation and compatible regulatory framework
criteria.  Credible quality infrastructure and a transparent chain of custody
are also needed to build confidence and trust in hydrogen certificates. Beyond
facilitating hydrogen trade, certificates can help incentivise trade in hydrogen
derivatives or other green commodities such as steel or ammonia.    Additional
