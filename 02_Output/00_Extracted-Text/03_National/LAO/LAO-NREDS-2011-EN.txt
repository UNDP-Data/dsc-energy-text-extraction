Overview of Renewable Energy 
1.1. 
Introduction 
This strategy aims to develop new renewable energy resources which are not yet widely 
explored  in  Lao  PDR  to  replace  resources  that  will  be  exhausted  in  the  future,  also  known  as 
“non-renewable energy” (fossil fuels, coal, natural gas etc).  These renewable energy resources 
comprise  biomass energy (biofuels, biogas, ...); solar energy; wind; small hydropower. 
Energy  is  essential  for  meeting  the  peoples’  basic  needs  as  well  as  vital  in  fuelling 
economic  development.    The  increase  in  population  and  economic  growth  have  resulted  in 
increase of energy consumption.  Reserves of non-renewable energy, being the dominant traded 
energy commodity, are declining.  In particular, liquid fossil fuels are estimated to be depleted 
within  the  next  few  decades.    Many  countries  in  the  world  have  recognized  the  importance  of 
renewable  energies,  and  therefore  have  undertaken  technology  research  and  development,  and 
have set up goals for the development and effective use of their Renewable energy resources. 
1.2.  Renewable energy development at the international level  
1.2.1.  General overview 
As known,  Fossil fuels are accumulated biomass since ancient past.. A huge amount of 
these fossil fuels had already been consumed in the 20th century. Furthermore,  future extraction 
will  be  more    challenging  and  more  costly.  With  present  fossil  fuel  use  rate  ,  all  available 
reserves of petroleum and natural gas will be exploited within the 21st century (BP, 2003). 
Additional  to  exhaustibility  of  fossil,  usage  of  fossil  energy  resources  also  creates 
harmful  effects  to  to  environment,  particularly  Green  House  Gas  emission,  which  is  the  main 
cause for Global Climate changes. While, nuclear power shall  not the right solution due to the 
limited reserve uranium in the world and security concerns from nuclear energy utilization . 
Recognizing 
the  above  mentioned  challenges  many  countries  have 
to 
reformulation of their energy strategy in order to be self sufficient and secured in energy supply. 
The  first  step  is  to  promote  the  efficiency  of  energy  usage  from  still  available;  and  the  second 
step,  turn  to  development  of  inexhaustible  and  environmental  friendly  renewable  energy 
resources.    
turned 
According  to  International  Energy  Agency  (IEA),  Total  Primary  energy  consumption(1) 
worldwide in 2008 counted for 12,267 MTOE,  share of renewable energy resources  was 12.9% 
(Figure  1.3).  Of  the  renewable  energy  shares,  combustible  biomass  and  wastes  counted  for 
10.0%,  small  change  observed  in  hydropower  2.2%  because  hydropower  development  in 
developed  countries  has  reached  saturation  and  the  slight  increase  is  due  to  developing  world. 
The  use  of  Other  renewable  energies  (such  as  wind,  solar,  geothermal  energy,  ...)    rapidly 
increased from  0.1%  in 2001 to 0.7% (2008), mainly solar and wind.

1.2.2.  International Challenges 
Various  external  challenges  exist  which  affect  the  promotion  and  the  development  of 
renewable energies, and these are: 
•  Climate change due to the release of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; 
•  Developing  economies  are  transforming  from  agriculture  to  industrial  based 
economies.  This results in the growth of energy use as the manufacture of domestic 
products relies increasingly on industrial production; 
•  Expansion of urbanization and  modern  cities shows  change in  energy  consumption 
patterns; 
•  Renewable energy developments are still dependent on foreign donors and investors; 
• 
Income generation and employment derived from renewable energy development are 
not very high. 
1.2.3.  Trend of Renewable energy Development 
 In the reference Scenario, it was estimated that World's Total Primary Energy (TPES) 
Demand will grow with a rate of 45% between 2006-30, or about 1.6% per annum (Figure 1.3). 
Energy Intensity3 decreases 1.7% per annum. Decrease of energy intensity is due to switching to 
market service oriented in many non-OECD and efficiency improvement in energy sector and 
energy consumption in OECD member’s countries.  
Hydropower has become important energy resource for power generation and such role 
will be unchanged in the reference scenario. While large hydropower resources of developed 
countries have already exploited, the large hydropower projects development will take place in 
non-OECD countries. Hydropower growth rate is around 1.9% per year and the share in TPES 
demand will remain 2%. By 2030 the share of hydropower in world total power generation will 
be 14%.  
                                             
3 -is the expense of energy per unit of real GDP (-in term of Purchase Power parity) 
6 
 
The use of combustible  Biomass and waste will increase 1.4% per annum.  This figure 
will  be  different  by  countries,  depending  on  how  these  energy  resources  are  used:  the  use  of 
biomass  for  biofuels  production  and  power  generation  will  increase  rapidly,  but  traditional 
biomass for cooking by low efficient stoves in poor households in developing countries will have 
slower increase. The use of Biomass and wastes for power generation in OECD will grow at a 
rate of 5.4% per annum from the low base.  
  
Figure 1.3  Trend of the world's TPES demand 1980-2030) (WEO IEA 2008)      
Other  renewable,  such  as  wind,  solar,  geothermal  will  increase  most  rapidly  among  all 
energy  resources, with  growth rate 7.2% per annum throughout this period. The share of other 
RE in power generation by 2030 will increase from 1% in 2006 to 4% in 2030. 
The changes in fuel compositions are also different by countries and regions. In OECD 
group, where increase of total demand is rather slow, Oil demand is slightly decrease, but the gas 
and renewable energies exclusive hydropower are the important part in such growth. Demand of 
Eastern  Europe  and  Eurasia      (including  Russia)  will  increase  by  336  Mtoe  between  2006  and 
2030, of which about 60% is due to oil and gas consumption. China and India mainly still relay 
on coal. It is observed that energy demand in other countries of Asia and Latin America rather 
differ.  Although coal demand is the most quickly growing, but Middle East countries still relay 
on Oil and Gas. Gas consumption in the region is counted for 26% of world's total. Biomass and 
wastes  energy,  and  other  energy  resources  is  around  40%  of  total  energy  demand  in  Africa, 
mainly  fuel  wood,  agriculture  and  forestry  residues  and  charcoal  for  cooking  and  heating. 
Contrary,  about  61%    in  biomass  and  other  Renewable  energy  share  excluding  hydropower  in 
OECD  are in the form of modern technology, mainly wind. Biggest share in Biofuels production 
is in North and Latin America (Table 1.1).

South  East  Asian  countries  established  targets  for  renewable  energy  development  at 
around 20 percent of the total energy demand by 2025. 
At  least,  83  countries  (41  developed  and  42  developing)  have  some  type  of  policy  to 
promote  renewable  power  generation  (REN21).  The    most  common  policy  types  are  feed-in 
tariffs, renewable portfolio standards, capital subsidies or grants, investment tax credits, sales tax 
or VAT exemptions, green certificate trading, direct energy production payments or tax credits, 
net metering, direct public investment or financing, and public competitive bidding. 
1.3.  Renewable energy Development in Lao PDR 
1.3.1.  Overview 
In 2009, the average fuel use in Lao PDR was 0.935 tons of TOE. Fuel consumption in 
Lao  PDR  however  remains  very  low  compared  with  other  developing  countries.    Energy 
consumption in the country is mainly in the form of traditional fuels, i.e. the use of biomass such 
as fuel wood (56%) and charcoal (12%) for cooking and heating in rural areas.  This represents 
around 69% of the total energy consumption (Figure1.4).

Figure1.5 Energy consumptions by sectors  (MEM) 
Lao  population  is  around  6.7  million,  average  per  capita  GDP  is  960  US$/year,  The 
average domestic GDP growth rate is between 7.8% per annum (2006-2010). During the last five 
years,  growth  rate  of  industry      reached  13-14%  for  2006-2010.    The    economic  growth  rate 
between  7.5-8  percent  during  the  sixth  five-year  plan  has  resulted  in  rising  domestic  energy 
consumption.    At  present,  although  economic  growth  has  slowed  down  as  a  result  of  the 
international financial crisis, energy demand of the country continues to rise.  On the consumer 
side,  the  demand  of  energy  for  transportation  is  high  due  to  rapid  increase  of  personal  vehicle 
ownership. 
1.3.2.  Potential of Renewable energy in Lao PDR 
Although Lao PDR lacks of conventional energy resources (e.g., Oil or Natural Gas) and 
has some reserve of coal, but there are abundant renewable energy resources, such as Biomass, 
hydropower, solar energy. In some part of the country there are some potential of wind and 
geothermal energy (appendix 1).   
Potential of biomass in Lao PDR includes energy crops and organic wastes. Energy crops 
comprise Oily crop (Palm, Jatropha, Vernicia Montana, Sun flower, Beans, coconut, etc), sugar 
and  starch  (sugarcane,  Cassava,    corn)  and  quick  growing  trees  and  aquatic  cultures.  Organic 
wastes  include  residues  of  agriculture-Forestry  production,  By-products  of  agro-forestry 
industry(sawdust, wood chips, rice husk,  corn cobs, livestock manures...) and municipal wastes 
(Households' wastes, communal wastes, food processing wastes...). It was estimated that utilizing 
of livestock wastes for biogas production could generate around 2.8x108 m3 of biogas per year, 
or equivalent to 5x108 kWh electricity (about 216 MTOE).  
Hydropower  is  the  most  important  energy  resources  in  Lao  PDR,  which  technical 
potential  was  estimated  around  26,000  MW,  where  yet  counted  small  scale  hydropower  sites 
below 15 MW and estimated potential around 2000 MW. In the Lao PDR hydropower projects 
with capacity bellow 15 MW are classified as small-scale hydropower. 
9 
 
Solar irradiance on Lao PDR is between 3.6-5.5 kWh/m2, with sunshine 1800-2000 
hrs/year. With such solar energy potential, if photovoltaic technology was used (overall 
efficiency of 10%), it would generate 146 kWh/m2/year, or 1.5x108 kWh/km2/year (  13 
MTOE/km2/year). 
  There  is  lack  of  data  on  wind  energy  potential,  particularly  at  a  height  above  50  m. 
According to international data sources, there maybe some wind potential in central provinces of 
Lao  PDR,  especially  up  of  high  mountains  along  Lao-Vietnam  border    (Savannakhet  and 
Khammouane provinces) where  at a height 50 m and above, wind speeds reach 5.8 m/s  4. The 
theoretical  potential  for  wind  energy  in  Lao  PDR  is  estimated  to  be  more  than  182,000  MW 
though  the  potential  under  very  good  and  excellent  wind  regimes  is  relatively  small  at  around 
2,800 MW.  These resources are not ensuring due to lack of measurements.  Wind resources are 
identified  to  be  high  in  Khammouane  and  Savannaket  provinces.  At  the  present  Ministry  of 
Energy  and  Mines  is  ongoing  installation  wind  data  logger  in  four  sites  in  these  province  and 
plan to install in other provinces. 
Lao PDR has rather low geothermal energy potential and currently not suitable for energy 
utilization. There some small geothermal resources in the form of hot spring only. 
1.3.3.  Status of Renewable energy development in Lao PDR 
In  the  past,  fuel  crops  plantation  for  the  production  of  biofuels  had  been  initiated  by 
private  investors.  These  developments  however  were  pilot  and  demonstration  projects.  The 
Government  of  Lao  PDR  has  setup  policy  in  order  to  promote  biofuels  production  and  use, 
particularly from jatropha and other appropriate energy feedstock.   
Installation of small solar home systems have been carried  by public as  well as  private 
sectors,  with  funding  from  the  World  Bank,  international  organizations  or  own  investment  of 
local  private  companies.    At  present,  around  20,000  households  have  been  supplied  electricity 
through  solar  home  systems.  Larger  PV  systems  (capacity  up  to  40-100  kWp)  have  also  been 
piloted  within  cooperation  project  between  MEM  and  NEDO  (Japan),  as  a  component  of  a 
hybrid power system with micro hydropower in remote rural area.  
In  addition,  micro  hydropower  and  pico  hydropower  have  been  developed  to  supply 
electric power to households in off-grid remote rural areas. Upto now, installed capacity of small 
scale hydropower projects (capacity less than 15 MW) have reached 23 MW.  
Biodiesel development from Jatropha, Vernicia Montana, Animal Fat, used tires and City 
wastes have been piloted by private sector. Fuel crops plantation for biofuels production has also 
progressed,  especially  Jatropha,  Vernicia  Montana,  Palm,  Sugarcane,  Cassava  plantation 
.Parallel  to  development  of  renewable  energy  resources,  energy  efficiency  and  energy 
conservation (EE&EC) issues have played more and more important role in energy sector of Lao 
PDR. In recent years, several pilot projects on EE&C have been carried out, such as Promotion 
of energy efficiency and energy conservation (PROMEEC) under cooperation program between 
ASEAN  Center  for  Energy  and  Japan;  Renewable  energy  and  energy  conservation  under  the 
framework of ACMECS program between Lao PDR and Thailand.

1.3.4.  Renewable energy stakeholders  
At present, there is no comprehensive renewable energy policy and strategy in Lao PDR. 
Projects  implementations  were  carried  out  by  various  sectors  which  lead  to  gaps  in  the 
management and promotion of the development of renewable energies.  Although there are some 
Private sector investments in fuel crops plantation, but facing significant obstacles due to lacking 
appropriate management mechanism 
  
In recent years, several public organizations and stakeholders have been involved in the 
development of renewable energy: 
•  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines  has  been  actively  involved  in  various  renewable 
energy activities, particularly in the development of solar energy, micro hydropower, 
bio-energy, and bio-fuel; 
•  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  has  been  piloting  project  with  small  family-
seized biogas digester and carried study on the plantation of fuel crops (Jatropha, and 
other); 
•  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology  has  carried  out  research  projects  on  on 
renewable energy utilization in Lao PDR. 
Besides,  other  organizations  and  institutions,  such  as  Universities,  research  institutes, 
Non-profit  organizations,  etc    have  also  been  involved  in  renewable  energy  research  and 
development,  namelyNational  University  of  Laos,  Organic  Production  Promotion  Association, 
Agricultural and Handicraft Promotion Association, Plantation Promotion Association, Lao State 
Fuel  Company,  Kolao  company,  Sunlabob  Renewable  Energy  Co.,  Ltd,  Luangprabang  Teak 
Tree Import-Export Co, Ltd (Kao Oil Tree Protection Promotion Plant and Development Project) 
and Bio-diesel Company. 
1.3.5.  Renewable energy resources assessment  
Based  on  existing  data    and  in  consultation  with  various  stakeholders,  it  was  clear  that  
renewable  energy  potential  assessment  needed  to  be  carried  out.    Several  aspects  are  to  be  be 
considered:: 
 
• 
•  Master plan for each renewable energy, such as Biomass, Wind and Other; 
•  Recently  drafted  Rural  electrification  master  plan  provides  clearer  understanding 
about  energy  demand  and  supply  in  rural  areas,  particularly  community  small 
hydropower and solar power; 
Improvement of Data collection in provincial level; 
•  Study  on  Biofuels  was  completed  by  end  of  2009,  but  no  studies  on  feasibility  and 
socio-economic  impacts  of  land  use  for  biofuels  feedstock  production  were  carried 
out; 
•  Biomass information does not include those from the sugar industry, despite the fact 
that the annual production of sugar is around 750,000 tons; 
•  The carried out studies were mainly concerned energy demand, demand growth rates, 
renewable  energy  potential,  energy  export  plans  and  rural  electrification,  but  the 
11 
 
variety and appropriateness of technologies for the development of renewable energy 
have not yet been seriously considered. 
1.3.6.  Domestic challenges 
Key  challenges  and  constraints  on  the  development  of  renewable  energies  in  Lao  PDR 
are as follows: 
•  No specific policies or strategies on renewable energy promotion; 
•  Lack of coordination between stakeholders in renewable energy projects; 
•  Renewable  energy  policy  has  not  yet  been  clearly  stated  in  the  National  Socio-
economic  Development  Plans  or  in  strategies  on  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  as 
well as five year plans of the government; 
•  Lack of specific regulations and laws on renewable energies; 
• 
•  Users have insufficient  knowledge and understanding on renewable energies; 
•  Lack  of  public  funding  support  for  the  renewable  energy  sector,  especially  for 
It was not clear yet, who responsible for approval of renewable energy projects; 
research and development; 
•  Absence of energy pricing regulation is a risk for investors; 
•  Rural households prefer grid electricity rather than off-grid one; 
• 
•  Electricity access rate in remote areas is still low due to high cost of grid extension. 
Insufficient information on renewable energy potential for provincial level;  
1.3.7.  International Cooperation in renewable energy 
South-East  Asia  is  abundant  of  natural  resources.  In  particular  renewable  energy 
resources, such as hydropower, Biomass energy, solar energy, geothermal power, Wind power, 
etc.  Therefore,  there  should  be  strengthened  cooperation  among  ASEAN  nations  in  order  to 
secure energy self-sufficiency. SEAN member countries have agreed on construction of SEAN 
Power  Network.  Lao  PDR  would  get  benefit  from  this  network  by  supplying  power  from  its 
renewable resources, particularly hydropower.  
Natural conditions and geographical location of Lao PDR are favorable for development 
of  renewable  energy  resources  for  domestic  consumption  and  export.  Lao  government  has  had 
plans  to  development  its  abundant  hydropower  to  meet  needs  of  neighboring  countries  and 
domestic demand. 
1.3.8.  Future trend of Renewable energy in Lao PDR 
The  total  domestic  energy  demand  is  anticipated  to  increase  by  3.6  percent  per  annum, 
increasing from 1.8 million TOE in 2005 to 3.9 million TOE in 2025 (Figure1.6).  Despite the 
fact that the overall demand of energy in various economic sectors will remain high until 2025, 
the share of household sector declines from 77.8 percent in 2005 to 48.5 percent in 2025.  Energy 
demand  in  the  industrial  sector  is  increasing  at  around  8  percent  per  year  or  from  6.1  percent 
share to 16.9 percent during the period 2005 to 2025, while the transportation sector grows at 6.8 
percent per annum during that period. 
12 
 
Electricity generation is predicted to increase at 11 percent annually for the period 2005 
to  2025.    Most  of  produced  electricity  are  for  export  to  neighboring  countries  and  only  10 
percent  is  used  domestically.  The  domestic  demand  for  electricity  will  increase  from  425 
megawatts  in  2006  to  2,863  megawatts  in  2025.    This  increase  will  be  covered  mainly  by 
development of  hydropower and coal-fired power plants. 
The  demand  for  transportation  fuel  is  predicted  to  increase  by  5  percent  per  year.    By 
2025, the total demand for refined petroleum products will reach 1,174 million liters, of which 
45 percent is for gasoline (528 million liters) and 55 percent is for diesel (645 million liters).  
The  available  renewable  energy  resources  in  the  country  can  meet  some  domestic 
demand.  Table  1.2  illustrates  the  potential  of  renewable  energy  resources  of  Lao  PDR,  which 
may  help  achieving  target  of  the  government  for  the  share  of  renewable  energy  up  to  30%  of 
energy consumption by the year 2025.

Section 2. 
Strategy and Policy 
2.1  Vision 
The  Government  of  Lao  PDR  promotes  the  development  of  renewable  energies  as  an 
important  component  of  the  national  economic  development  to  ensure  energy  security,  sustain 
socio-economic development, and enhance environmental and social sustainability. 
2.2  Policies 
The promotion and development of renewable energies is one of the priority policies of the 
Government to stabilize energy supply and to assist in the social and economic improvement of the 
country. 
 
The Lao Government supports domestic and foreign entrepreneurs and investors to invest in 
energy  projects  at  the  village  level.  The  development  of  renewable  energy  resources  while 
responding to the needs of the local people contributes to the process of becoming self-sufficient in 
energy supply and for the development of energy exports.  Renewable energy development involves 
participation of public and private sectors. 
 
Policies  on  the  promotion  and  development  of  renewable  energies  in  Lao  PDR  focus  on 
Small  power  development  for  self  sufficiency  and  grid  connection,  biofuels  production  and 
marketing,  and  development  of  other  clean  energies  in  the  country.    The  government  defines 
priorities for development as follows: 
 
•  Provide financial incentives to investors who aim to produce clean energies to meet domestic 
demand  and,  who  take  socially  and  environmental  corporate  responsibility  in  order  to 
increase investments in renewable energy projects; 
•  Formulate and improve laws and regulations to facilitate renewable energy development. 
For electricity and energy development in rural areas, important aspects being considered are 
 
as follows: 
•  Prioritization  of  policies  which  facilitate  private  sector  investments  in  rural  electrification 
such as provision of incentives and financing; 
•  Development of small power systems, biofuels, solar and biomass energy at the village level 
to provide electricity and energy to rural and remote communities; 
•  Generation of electricity for productive uses at the village level using waste materials from 
agriculture,  biogas,  hydropower  or  other  local  resources.    People  in  rural  areas  will  be 
encouraged  to  use  renewable  energy  to  enhance  self-sufficiency  and  the  GoL  will  seek 
cooperation  with  private  sector,  NGO  and  development  partners  to  encourage  investment 
support for processing equipment and necessary machinery adjustments. 
Integrated  with  national  climate  change  strategy:  Increase  public  awareness  and 
understanding of climate change impacts and the need for mitigation and adaptation. 
2.3  Objectives 
The main objectives of this strategy are the following: 
15 
 
•  To ensure adequate supply of energy, energy efficiency and conservation throughout the 
country and promote cultivation of fuel crops for the production of bio-fuels to replace 
imported fossil fuels; 
•  To bring socio-economic benefits, including:  
o  development of RE industry, contribution to national economic growth; 
o  contribution to poverty reduction through improved livelihoods (income generation 
from RE production and employment opportunities inclusive of vulnerable groups to 
ensure decreased income disparities), and; 
o 
increased gender equality. 
•  To ensure environmentally and socially sustainable development through enforcement of 
adequate safeguards to ensure:  
o 
local communities’ food security, and secure access to adequate land to meet and 
develop their livelihoods for all ethnic groups with special focus on women;  
o  forest cover, biodiversity, agrobiodiveristy, and soil and water quality; 
o  reduction of green-house gases through replacement of fossil fuels and control of 
negative land conversion impacts from climate change. 
2.4 
Targets for 2025 
The Government aims to increase the share of renewable energies to 30% of the total energy 
consumption in 2025.  To reduce the importation of fossil fuels, the Government outlines a tentative 
vision  to  reach  10%  of  the  total  transport  energy  consumption  from  biofuels.  This  target  will  be 
regularly revisited and revised, feeding in results of special studies, lessons learned from on-going 
implementation, and international technological developments in the field of RE. 
 
2.5 
Scope of Policy 
The  government  policy  is  to  promote  investments  in  energy  production  from  public  and 
private  sectors,  and  from  local  and  foreign  investors.    The  focus  is  on  the  development  of  the 
following: 
 
•  Biofuels; 
•  Small  power 
•  Other renewable energies such as solar, biomass, biogas and wind; 
•  Other alternative fuels for transportation. 
2.6  Development Strategy 
Lao PDR has experienced rapid economic growth since the past decade.  During the past five 
years the economy grew between 7-8 per cent per year while the industrial growth rate has doubled 
and reached 14 percent in 2007.  The success in the development of electricity and mines has helped 
spawn this rapid economic growth. 
 
16 
 
This rapid economic growth has stimulated an increase in domestic energy consumption. In 
addition, the demand of energy for transportation is expected to continue to grow due to increase in 
personal vehicle ownership. 
 
Lao  government  defines  the  strategy  for  development  of  each  energy  resource  in  the 
 
following subsections. 
2.6.1  Promotion and development of bio-fuels 
Bio-energy provides an alternative fuel supply for the transportation sector and in the supply 
of  energy  to  rural  communities.    Without  domestic  oil  and  gas  resources,  Lao  PDR  is  completely 
dependent  from  external  sources  for  its  petroleum  fuel  requirements.    The  country  imported  560 
million liters of fossil fuels in 2010, a significant increase 5 percent a year.  With higher economic 
growth  prospects,  oil  imports  are  expected  to  high.    This  increases  the  country’s  vulnerability  to 
external  supply  disruptions  and  fuel  price  volatility,  and  the  negative  impacts  to  the  country’s 
balance  of  payments.    To  reduce  the  importation  of  fossil  fuels  and  optimize  the  use  of  marginal 
lands,  the  Government  will  encourage  and  actively  promote  development  of  fuel  crops  in  the 
country with a preference for smallholder production under maintained community land ownership 
and control. 
 
This  strategy  aims  to  kick-start  the  development  of  the  biofuels  market  in  the  country 
through  the  provision  of  incentives  to  farmers,  domestic  and  foreign  investors  to  engage  in  the 
production  of  biofuels  for  domestic  utilization  and  at  the  same  time  monitor  its  development  and 
ensure proper mitigation of negative impacts. 
 
The tentative vision for the promotion and development of biofuels are the following: 
•  Substitute 10% of the transportation fuel demand by 2025; 
• 
Increase deployment of biofuels technologies in rural areas. 
In meeting these targets, the Government will carry out the following: 
• 
Issue  a  Biofuels  Decree  which  provides  an  overall  legal  framework  for  setting  the  targets; 
stipulates specific development goals; defines incentives, support and obligations of private 
investors including small-scale producers who are committed to produce exclusively for the 
domestic  market;  and  establishes  institutional  arrangement  for  the  promotion  and 
development of biofuels. In the case of oversupply of biofuels, export will be allowed but no 
incentives or subsidies will be given to investors for the production for export; 
•  Establish  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  a  body/agency  responsible  for  the  promotion  and 
development of biofuels as well as in setting reference price for biofuels; 
•  Formulate a Biofuels Action Plan (biodiesel and bio ethanol) as blueprint for development.  
The  Plan  specifies  feedstock  for  biodiesel  and  bio  ethanol  production  based  on  detailed 
feasibility studies, impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the alternative feed-stocks 
with special focus on biophysical land availability and socio-economic feasibility.  Promote 
and  support  contract  farming  schemes,  small-scale  family-based  biofuels  feedstock 
production, and biofuels producer associations, while limiting the development of large-scale 
investor  concessions  and  managed  production  concessions,  and  ensure  adequate  control  of 
existing concessions.  Establish partnership with current investors to ensure stable supply of 
17 
 
feedstock.  Actively promote small-scale family-based production of fuel crops and establish 
model farms to enhance attractiveness of small-scale development; 
• 
In  partnership  with  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry,  establish  a  nationwide  extension 
network  to  provide  technical  assistance  to  small-scale  producers.  Support  research, 
demonstration and large-scale implementation of practices and interventions to increase fuel 
crop productivity and intercropping with food and commercial agriculture crops; 
•  Provide  support  to  research,  demonstration  and  field  testing  of  high  yielding  fuel  crop 
varieties.  Support research and field testing of second generation biofuels feedstock; 
•  Provide  financing  to  small  scale  producers  and  encourage  local  financing  institutions  to 
extend financing services to small-scale biofuels feedstock producers; 
•  Support  the  establishment  and  development  of  nationwide  marketing  network  for  biofuels 
feedstock.  Support farmers’ associations and local traders in marketing biofuels feedstock; 
•  Establish  partnership  with  industry  players  for  the  processing,  production,  blending  and 
distribution  of  biofuels.    Solicit  support  from  the  industry  for  initial  demonstration  of 
biofuels  prior  to  large-scale  implementation  of  biofuels  targets.    Introduce  biofuels 
standardization.    Carry  out  information  campaign  to  raise  consumer  awareness  concerning 
biofuels use; 
•  Carry out research and demonstration of community use, farm machinery use and other rural 
applications  of  biofuels.    Undertake  information  campaign  to  promote  the  utilization  of 
biofuels technologies in rural areas. 
2.6.2  Promotion and development of small hydropower 
Hydropower resource is the most abundant energy resource in Lao PDR.  The development 
of small hydropower (capacity up to 15 MW) could play an important role in meeting the country’s 
objectives of increasing rural electrification coverage from the current level of 70% to 90% in 2020.  
In  addition,  small  hydropower  development  helps  open  avenues  for  economic  improvement  and 
poverty  reduction  in  remote  rural  areas.    Small  hydropower  provides  least-cost  power  supply  to 
remote areas which currently rely on imported electricity.  Local small hydropower plants will also 
help improve the reliability of the country’s power system and reduce transmission and distribution 
line losses. 
Lao PDR has substantial potential for small hydropower development which is estimated to 
be around 2,000 MW.  The  government intends to develop around 650 MW of small hydropower 
capacity between 2010 and 2025 by private and community. 
 
In the past, Small hydropower development, were not sustainable due to natural disaster, lack 
of  management,  lack  of  technical  and  budget  for  maintenance..    To  promote  the  development  of 
small  hydropower  resources,  the  Government  will  implement  measures  to  address  the  existing 
technical,  financial,  procedural  and  institutional  barriers  to  small  hydropower  development  in  the 
country. 
 
•  Carry  out  resource  assessment  and  prepare  small  hydropower  development  plan.    The 
Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) will carry out small hydropower resource assessment, 
18 
 
identify priority projects for development, and develop a small hydropower investment plan 
for each key river basin to optimize usage and benefits of water flow for power generation, 
irrigation,  water  supply  as  well  as  environmental  and  social  protection.    The  plan  also 
includes rehabilitation of old and inefficient small hydropower projects; 
• 
Introduce  procedures  for  solicited  and  unsolicited  small  hydropower  independent  power 
producers  (IPPs).    Proposals  for  small  hydropower  projects  at  preselected  sites  will  be 
solicited  by  MEM  through  competitive  tender  process.    On  the  other  hand,  MEM  also 
accepts  unsolicited  proposals  from  small  hydropower  project  sponsors.    For  both  solicited 
and  unsolicited  projects,  MEM  will  establish  transparent  procedures  in  the  submission, 
evaluation  with  special  emphasis  on  environmental  and  social  aspects  and  processing  of 
projects as well as determination of off-take power tariffs and rules for grid interconnection 
and power dispatch; 
• 
Introduce  simplified  small  hydropower  development  framework.    The  current  framework 
governing  small  hydropower  development  is  the  existing  legal  framework  for  IPP 
procurement.    To  support  the  objectives  of  the  Amended  Electricity  Law  of  18  December 
2008 expediting the development of 5 MW or less small hydropower projects in Lao PDR, 
MEM will introduce simplified procedures for small hydropower project with capacity of 5 
MW  or  less.    The  simplified  procedures  however  ensure  that  environmental  and  social 
safeguards  are  enforced,  and  that  local  communities  are  consulted  and  that  they  possibly 
participate as project shareholders.  This includes exemption from the concession agreement 
requirement and negotiations will be carried out directly with provincial governments.  On 
the  other  hand,  the  existing  IPP  framework  and  the  above  proposed  procedures  remain 
relevant for small hydropower projects with capacity between 5 MW and 15 MW; 
•  Ensure  grid  access  and  promote  third  party  sale  of  power.    MEM  will  coordinate  with 
Electricite  du  Laos  to  provide  undiscriminatory  access  to  small  hydropower  projects  to 
transmission  network  and  provide  priority  dispatch  of  all  the  power  generated  by  grid-
connected  small  hydropower  projects.    In  addition,  small  hydropower  producers  will  be 
allowed  to  sell  the  entire  amount  or  part  of  the  power  generated  directly  to  third  party 
consumers; 
• 
Introduce  legal  framework  for  setting  off-take  tariff  for  small  hydropower  projects  at  an 
appropriate  level  ensuring  investors  to  recover  project  costs  and  earn  reasonable  return  on 
investments; 
•  Establish framework and program to provide financing and guarantees to small hydropower 
projects.    Encourage  local  financing  institutions  including  state  owned  banks  to  provide 
loans and preferential financial packages. 
In  addition  to  the  above,  pico  hydropower  technologies  are  relatively  popular  in  remote 
villages in Lao PDR as source of power generation. The deployment of these technologies is mainly 
market  driven.    Presently,  around  60  thousand  units  are  installed  all  over  the  country  supplying 
electricity services to about 90 thousand households.  Though there is a declining trend on the use of 
this technology due to increased rural electrification rate, pico hydropower is estimated to continue 
19 
 
to play an important role in the next decade.  The use of this technology is however associated with 
technical  and  safety  problems.    To  address  these  issues,  the  Government  will  carry  out  the 
following: 
•  Raise public awareness on benefits and proper installation and use of pico hydropower; 
•  Upscale best practice pilot projects and facilitate information exchange; 
•  Coordinate with other relevant agencies on water utilization for pico-hydropower and other 
economic uses; 
•  Setup supply-maintenance service chain and advisory service network; 
•  Carry out regular training on installation design, installation and maintenance; 
•  Provide support to local entrepreneurs to manufacture components of pico-hydropower. 
2.6.3  Promotion and development of solar energy 
Solar energy is one of the abundant energy resources in Lao PDR.  The country receives an 
average solar irradiation between 3.5 to 5 kWh/m2/day.  Solar energies can play an important role in 
achieving government objectives to provide energy services to off-grid and remote areas, stimulate 
private sector investments, and improve energy efficiency in households and commercial buildings. 
 
To  encourage  the  use  of  solar  energy  in  order  to  reduce  consumption  of  other  types  of 
commercial energies and reduce environmental impacts, the Government promotes the development 
of solar energies in the following service areas: 
 
•  Provide lighting services through the installation of solar home systems in rural and remote 
areas which do not have access to the national grid; 
•  Support  the  development  of  the  solar  energy  business  in  the  country  for  the  installation  of 
large-scale grid connected solar energy systems and hybrid systems and for the provision of 
energy services in off-grid areas;  
•  Promote the use of solar energy in water and space heating for households and commercial 
installations; 
•  Promote the use of solar energy in productive uses such as drying agriculture produce, etc; 
•  For  the  period  2010-2020,  the  Government  under  the  Rural  Electrification  Master  Plan 
(REMP)  aims  to  upscale  the  program  covering  additional  19,000  households  within  331 
villages in 11 provinces. 
In  addition,  the  Government  also  encourages  the  development  of  grid  connected  solar  PV 
systems  and  solar  PV  hybrid  systems,  such  as  the  integration  with  small  hydropower  and  wind 
power,  to  sustain  supply  of  electricity  during  the  dry  season.    To  promote  the  utilization  of  solar 
energy for these purposes, the Government will carry out the following: 
 
•  Carry  out  resource  assessment  to  determine  the  potential  for  off-grid  hybrid  systems,  and 
building integrated and large scale grid connected solar PV systems; 
•  Prepare  a  solar  hybrid  system  program  specifying  appropriate  service  delivery  schemes, 
business models, information and training programs; 
20 
 
•  Develop  a  framework  to  stimulate  private  sector  investments  on  building  integrated  and 
large-scale grid connected solar PV projects; 
•  Undertake pilot demonstration projects, information dissemination and training programs for 
both hybrid and grid-connected systems; 
•  Promote up scaling of hybrid and grid connected solar PV projects. 
In addition to power generation, the Government also promotes the use of solar energy for 
thermal applications for individual households, commercial buildings and industrial applications as 
well as for productive uses. 
 
•  The Government will carry out market assessment and technical studies for solar water and 
space heating, and productive use of solar energy; 
•  Prepare a national program for the promotion of solar water heaters and productive uses of 
solar energy specifying delivery framework and business models, information campaign and 
capacity building; 
•  Carry  out  pilot  demonstration  projects,  information  dissemination  and  training  programs 
targeting domestic, commercial and industrial applications. 
2.6.4  Promotion and development of biogas 
Lao  PDR  imports  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG)  for  domestic  and  industrial  utilization.  
LPG  imports  are  relatively  high  amounting  to  871,800  kg  in  2006.    LPG  imports  could  be 
potentially reduced through the development of household and industrial scale biogas systems in the 
country.    Significant  potential  exist  in  Lao  PDR  for  biogas  production  from  animal  and  livestock 
wastes, agro-industrial wastes, municipal solid wastes and waste water treatment plants. 
 
A  number  of  demonstration  projects  have  been  initiated  and  funded  by  several  donor 
organizations for the development of household and community scale biogas systems using animal 
and livestock wastes.  The Government aims to sustain these initiatives by up scaling and increasing 
the number of households using biogas by 50,000 in 2025 to reduce the importation of LPG, the use 
of  firewood  and  charcoal,  and  the  use  of  electricity  for  heating.    To  achieve  this  goal,  the 
Government will carry out the following: 
 
•  Designate and strengthen the capacity of an agency/organization responsible for up scaling 
household and community-based as well as medium and large scale biogas systems; 
• 
In  partnership  with  private  entrepreneurs  and  non-governmental  organizations,  carry  out 
technical studies, identify the most appropriate business model and support mechanisms, and 
prepare  a  long-term  program  including  monitoring  plans  for  up  scaling  household  biogas 
systems in Lao PDR; 
•  Carry  out  information  campaign  and  training  programs  for  biogas  system  installation  and 
utilization.  Develop an accreditation scheme to certify installers; 
•  Secure program financing, pilot test the new business model, and promote replication at the 
national level. 
21 
 
The  Government  also  promotes  the  development  of  large-scale  biogas  production  for 
lighting,  heating  and  electricity  generation  (either  for  project  owner’s  own  use  or  for  grid-
connection)  using  several  feedstock  such  as  agro-industrial  wastes,  municipal  solid  wastes,  waste 
water  treatments,  and  others.    Key  activities  to  be  undertaken  by  the  Government  include  the 
following: 
 
•  Carry out resource assessments and prepare a list of potential projects; 
• 
In consultation with stakeholders, prepare a framework to support private sector investments 
on medium and large-scale biogas systems, particularly those projects aiming for electricity 
generation for own use, third party sale or grid-connection; 
•  Carry  out  demonstration  projects,  information  campaign,  capacity  building  and  promote 
project replication; 
•  Support research, development and demonstration for various applications of biogas in Lao 
PDR. 
2.6.5  Promotion and development of other biomass energies 
Being a predominantly agriculture-based economy, Lao PDR generates substantial amount of 
wastes from agriculture and forest production and processing such as sugarcane bagasse, rice husks, 
corn  cobs,  wood  wastes,  etc.    Also,  with  growing  urbanization,  main  cities  are  also  generating 
significant amount of solid wastes.  At present, there is no large-scale exploitation of these resources 
for energy generation.  In addition, community forests could also be sustainably developed to supply 
fuel  for  energy  generation.    These  resources  could  potentially  generate  power  for  productive  uses 
and other modern energy services in both urban and rural areas, either for off-grid or grid connected 
systems.    The  Government  recognizes  the  use  of  these  agricultural  and  municipal  solid  wastes  to 
form part of the overall energy mix to ensure energy security of the country. 
 
In  promoting  biomass  energy  for  electricity  generation,  the  Government  will  undertake  the 
following: 
•  Carry out biomass resource assessment and prepare a list of priority projects; 
•  Formulate  a  framework  to  stimulate  private  sector  investments  in  power  generation  from 
various sources of biomass; 
•  Carry  out  pilot  demonstration  to  test  the  framework  developed  and  at  the  same  time  to 
demonstrate the technical viability of a specific biomass-based technology in the country; 
•  Undertake information dissemination and training programs; 
•  Develop biomass technology-based independent power producers (for both grid and off-grid 
power supply). 
 In addition to power generation, biomass fuels such as wood and charcoal are mainly used in 
rural  and  urban  areas  for  cooking.    Biomass  cooking  fuels  are  estimated  to  represent  around  70 
percent of the total energy consumption in Lao PDR.  The high dependence on biomass energies for 
cooking  has  major  implications  with  respect  to  environmental  degradation,  higher  time  spent  in 
wood fuel collection, and indoor air pollution which threatens the well-being of the most vulnerable 
22 
 
household members.  To address this issue the Government promotes the development and market 
deployment of the most efficient and appropriate cooking stoves in the country. 
•  Carry out market assessment and technical studies for improved cooking stoves (ICS) in Lao 
PDR; 
•  Prepare  a  program  on  ICS  which  include  service  delivery  framework  and  appropriate 
business  model,  technology  design,  technology  standardization  and  labelling,  information 
campaign, national capacity building on design and manufacture of technologies; 
• 
Identify projects for pilot demonstration and prepare feasibility studies; 
• 
Implement  demonstration  projects,  carry  out  information  campaign  and  undertake  training 
programs; 
•  Upscale improved cook stove program. 
2.6.6  Promotion and development of wind energy 
Based on the  existing data,  Wind energy  can be  potentially developed for large-scale  grid-
connected power  generation and for hybrid systems providing energy  services to rural and remote 
villages.  The Government aims to develop around 50 MW of wind power by 2025.  To promote the 
development of wind energy in the country, the Government will undertake the following: 
 
•  Expand  the  current  wind  measurement  campaign  and  upgrade  the  current  wind  atlas  using 
ground measurement data; 
• 
Identify potential sites for grid-connected and off-grid hybrid systems and priority sites for 
possible wind energy concessions; 
• 
In partnership with international financial and donor organizations, carry out demonstration 
projects for grid-connected as well as hybrid wind energy systems; 
•  Prepare  wind  concession  framework,  and  electricity  market  access  framework  including 
incentives framework to stimulate private investments in wind power in Lao PDR; 
•  With the support and cooperation from donor governments and international organizations, 
carry  out  information  campaign  and  build  national  capacity  on  wind  energy  power 
generation. 
2.6.7  Promotion and development of other alternative energy sources for Transport 
The government promotes and encourages domestic and foreign, public and private sectors, 
to  invest  in  research,  development  and  demonstration  as  well  as  in  feasibility  studies  of  other 
alternative energy technologies and sources for transportation sector.  
 
More specifically, the Government will undertake the following: 
•  Facilitate coordination among responsible agencies concerning urban transport development 
and possible utilization of alternative transport technologies and fuels; 
23 
 
•  Support  research  and  development  and  carry  out  feasibility  studies  and  demonstration 
projects  for  alternative  technologies  and  fuels  for  urban  transport  such  as  electricity,  fuel 
cells and hydrogen; 
•  Upscale the current demonstration projects concerning the use of biofuels in rural transport 
and farm machineries; 
•  Carry out studies and demonstration projects for the use of higher blend biofuels for freight 
transport; 
•  Based on the technical studies and demonstration projects, develop a long-tern program for 
sustainable transportation system in Lao PDR. 
2.7 
Financial mechanisms 
2.7.1  Participation of the private sector 
The private sector is permitted to invest in the following projects: 
 
•  Small power production (SPPs) projects with non-firm contract (the project is paid only for 
energy production); 
•  Grid  connected  renewable  energy  project  with  non-firm  contract  (for  own  use  and  sale  to 
EDL for surplus production); 
•  Grid  connected  renewable  energy  project  with  firm  contract  (project  is  paid  for  capacity 
provision and energy production); 
•  Off-grid projects; 
•  Activities  in  bio-energy,  biogas  or  bio-fuel  production  such  as  fuel  crops  plantation, 
construction of processing plant and bio-fuel production and blending. 
2.7.2  Financial incentives 
 Financial  related  barriers  to  renewable  energy  development  in  Lao  PDR  are  high  upfront 
investment requirement and lack of available find for renewable energy projects.  The Government 
will  provide  financial  incentives  and  financing  assistance  to  renewable  energy  projects  and 
investors. 
Financial Incentives 
 Investments in renewable energy projects in Lao PDR, whether on biofuels production, grid-
connected or isolated systems, off-grid projects, and individual systems, are entitled to investment 
incentives under the Investment Law of Lao PDR, update in 2009.  The financial incentives include 
the following: 
• 
Import duty free on production machinery, equipment and raw materials; 
• 
Import duty free on chemical materials necessary for biofuels production within 7 years; 
•  Profit tax is divided in to 3 categories: 20%, 15% and 10%.  Profit tax exemption is possible 
for a certain period depending on activities, investment areas and size investment; 
24 
 
•  Subsidies on unit product price depending on energy type and times period. 
Additionally, the investors can obtain also non-fiscal incentives, such as: 
•  Up to 75 years leasing term (for enterprise construction land); 
•  Permission to expatriate earnings to home or third countries; 
•  Right to employ foreign workforce (not more that 10% of the enterprise’s total labors). 
Financial mechanism  
The Government will provide support by seeking assistance from international organizations, 
commercial  banks  and  low  interest  loans  sources  for  funding  renewable  energy  projects;  to 
encourage  private  commercial  banks  in  understanding  and  interests  to  investment  into  renewable 
energy projects.  
Besides, the government shall issue the investment guidelines and development roadmaps to 
attract  internal  and  foreign  investments  in  renewable  energies.    The  Government  will  establish  a 
one-stop  service  centre  for  disseminating  information  and  facilitate  investments  on  renewable 
energies. 
2.7.3  Renewable Energy Fund 
To harmonize the support to renewable energies in Lao PDR, the Government will establish 
a  Renewable  Energy  (REN)  Fund  as  sub-account  to  the  existing  Rural  Electrification  (RE)  Fund.  
The Fund will be used for the following: 
 
•  Financial  assistance  for  the  development  of  renewable  energy  and  biofuel  industry  and 
market in Lao PDR; 
•  Finance barrier removal activities such as resource assessment; research, development, and 
demonstration activities; project preparatory studies, etc; 
•  Fund  capacity  building  activities,  promotional  activities,  dissemination  of  knowledge  on 
effective renewable energy use, etc. 
The Fund will be sourced from the following: 
•  Government budget; 
• 
International  organizations  and  donor  countries,  international  financial  organizations  and 
NGOs; 
•  Financial  contribution  or  investment  from  social  organizations  and  from  domestic  and 
foreign investors. 
Though the REN Fund is a sub-account of the RE Fund, the Government ensures that there is 
a  clear  separation  between  the  two  accounts.    The  existing  management  of  the  RE  Fund  will  also 
manage the REN Fund whose functions are the following: 
•  account, control and disburse funds; 
•  monitor loans and grants. 
The  Government  will  establish  a  Steering  Committee  who  will  be  responsible  for  making 
decisions on the use of funds with MEM acting its Secretariat. Each Province will be represented in 
the Steering Committee to ensure development of renewable energy markets in the provinces. 
25 
 
2.7.4  Carbon Financing 
The Government recognizes carbon financing as one of the measures to improve renewable 
energy project profitability in Lao PDR.  The emissions reductions that could be generated by these 
projects could be traded in the global carbon markets. 
The certified emission reduction (CER) market of the Clean Development Mechanism 
(CDM) is one of the global carbon markets that can be accessed by renewable energy project 
developers.  CDM is one of the flexible mechanisms established under the Kyoto Protocol of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to assist industrialized 
countries in meeting their emissions reduction obligations at lower cost and at the same time to 
stimulate investments that promote sustainable development in developing countries. 
Lao PDR satisfied the participation requirements for CDM.  The government ratified the 
Kyoto Protocol in 2004, appointed Water Resources and Environmental Administration (WREA) to 
be the Designated National Authority, developed sustainable development criteria, and established 
the approval processes for CDM projects.  With recent progress in CDM, the Government ensures 
that small-scale projects such as solar homes systems, pico hydropower, biogas, improved cook 
stoves, solar water heaters, etc will be developed under the CDM Program of Activities or 
programmatic CDM. 
In addition to CDM, the Government also encourages project proponents to access other 
carbon markets such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme where CDM CERs can be converted into 
EU allowance units, and to voluntary markets in Europe and North America that purchase verified 
emissions reductions for clean energy projects. 
2.8  Renewable Energy Road Maps 
In constructing the renewable energy road maps, timelines and milestones were defined for 
the  proposed  policy,  legal,  financial,  market  and  organizational  interventions  for  each  renewable 
energy type to meet the national target and specific renewable energy targets for 2025.  Road maps 
for the following renewable energies are given in the Annex. 
•  Biodiesel; 
•  Bio ethanol; 
•  Small hydropower; 
•  Solar energy; 
•  Biogas; 
•  Biomass; 
•  Wind energy; 
•  Other alternative sources of energy for transport. 
2.9 
Estimated Investment Cost for Renewable Energy Sector 
To  fulfill  the  goals  of  renewable  energy  sector  development,  the  government  encourages 
investments from public and private sectors.  
26 
 
The  government  will  facilitate  and  provide  appropriate  incentives  and  risk  guarantee  for 
investments in the renewable energy sector.  Investments in 2025 is projected to reach around USD 
1,799 million , of which USD 17 million is from the public sector, USD 36 million from domestic 
investors and USD 1746 million from foreign investors (see table 2.1):

o  Improve law and regulations related to renewable energy; 
o  Budget  for  related  sector  to  be  used  for  studies,  research  and  development,  promotion, 
mobilization, dissemination of renewable energy technology; 
o  Access  to  information  on  renewable  energy  such  as  potentials  of  solar  power,  wind 
energy, hydropower and sources of raw materials; 
o  Establish renewable energy technology standards. 
All related sectors should increase cooperation in the implementation of this strategy on the 
development of renewable energy.  Policies and instruments presented in this strategy are improved 
to  fit  with  goals  of  the  policy  in  order  to  attract  investors.    This  strategy  consists  of  three 
components;  the  increase  in  financial  support,  strengthened  legal  framework  and  enhanced 
coordination between public organizations and institutes.

Hydropower 
Potential for the development of hydropower, 
excluding potential sites along Mekong River, is 
26,500 MW. There has not been detailed 
feasibility studies or surveys on small hydropower 
under 5 MW 
The  current  total  capacity  of  small  hydropower  is 
11.5  MW with 22.5  MW more  under construction, 
contracted  with  EdL.  Furthermore,  over  100  MW 
are  under  feasibility  studies  by  the  private  sector.  
At  present,  ADB  is  funding  a  feasibility  study  of 
the hydropower potential under 5 MW 
Solar power plays a large role in rural 
electrification. 25,000 households have been 
supplied with solar home systems.  There are 
private companies and individuals who have been 
operating solar supply and installation business.  
1% of total installations are used for business 
purposes 
Surveyed  data  show  that  around  90%  of  Lao 
population  still  relay  on  biomass  energy  for 
cooking,  and  small  rural  industrial  needs  (such  as 
masonry  production,  tobacco  processing,  alcohol 
production  and  so  on).  There  was  attempt  to  pilot 
small scale gasification power production.   
Solar power 
Lao PDR has 300 days of sun light per year.  The 
potential capacity of solar energy is 4.5-5 
KWh/m2/day. Laos has the good locations for 
solar power, particularly in the southern parts 
Biomass 
Lao  PDR  is  an  agricultural  based  country.  There 
are  a  lots  of  wastes  generated  every  year  from 
agro-forestry production, such as rice straws/husk, 
sawdust, corn cobs, livestock manures, which can 
be  used  as  feedstock  for  energy  generation. 
Besides,  communal  and  organic  industrial  wastes 
are  among 
important  biomass  energy 
resources.  Annual  Energy  Potential  of  Agro-
forestry wastes is estimated around 500 MTOE.  
the 
In  recent  years,  there  have  been  conducted  pilot 
for  biodiesel 
jatropha  plantation 
projects  on 
production.  Kolao  farm  has  invested  on  Jatropha 
plantation  on  2500  ha  and  pressing  factory  with 
capacity  40  ton  per  day,  and  biodiesel  processing 
factory  -  capacity  2000  L/day  in  Kenthao  district, 
Xayabouly province.  
There is also high potential of energy crops in Lao 
PDR,  such  as  oily  crops  (jatropha,  Vernicia 
Montana  nut,  oil  palm,  soybean,  etc),  starch 
culture  (cassava,  corn,)  sugar  (sugarcane)  and 
other  trees,  which  can  be  used  as  feedstock  for 
biofuels production. 
Besides,  a  teak  wood  company  in  Luang  Prabang 
has  piloted  plantation  of  Vernicia  Montana  nut  on 
area of 7000 ha. 
Furthermore,  variety  of  quick  growing  trees  or 
aquatic cultures can also play an important role in 
rural energy production and processing industry.       
SNV  together  with  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and 
Forestry  has  successfully  piloted  small  project  on 
promotion  of  family  size  biogas  digesters.  The 
government supports follow up projects. 
Obviously  to  say,  there  is  still  lack  of  data  on 
biomass resources in Lao PDR. 
MEM recently has installed wind data lodger in 
central Savannakhet province.  
Wind power 
In general, there lack of data on wind potential in 
Lao PDR, especially on height above 10 m.  Based 
on international data sources, it was estimated that 
there are high wind potential in central provinces, 
particularly at high mountainous areas along the 
Lao-Vietnam border of provices Khammouane 
and Savannakhet. At a height more than 50 m, 
average wind speed reaches 5.8 m/s, which 
appropriate for power generation.   
In general, Lao PDR has relatively low potential 
of geothermal energy. Observed geothermal 
resources in some provinces are low temperature 
one, not more than 70oC.  
Geothermal 
energy 
Currently, hot spring sites have used as the tourist 
destinations.
