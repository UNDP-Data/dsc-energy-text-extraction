I.  UNDP  within  the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Cooperation 
Framework 
1.  Nigeria has the largest economy ($429 billion US dollars in 2020)1 and is the most populous 
(211 million in 2021)2 country in Africa. Despite being the largest crude oil producer in Africa,3 
poverty (40 per cent or 82.9 people  million in 2019) and unemployment (33 per cent in 2021)4 
remain high. Nigeria ranked low in the Human Development Index (161 out of 189 countries in 
2020).5 The COVID-19 pandemic, cost-of-living crisis, disruptions to supply chains, and drop in 
revenue all compounded national development challenges. The World Bank estimates the national 
poverty rate may have increased to 42.5 per cent (90.2 million) in 2020.6 Moreover, Nigeria suffers 
from socio-economic deficits where close to 60 per cent of the rural population still lack access to 
electricity7 and only 5 per cent of the population uses clean energy sources for cooking, with there 
being a disproportionate and negative impact on women and girls.   
2.  Nigeria  is  vulnerable  to  conflict-related  and  environmental  risks  (desertification  and  natural 
disasters). Governance, peace, and security deficits (102 out of 104 countries in the Chandler Good 
Government Index, 34 out of 54 countries in the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance, 154 
out 180 countries in the 2021 Transparency International Corruption Perception Index, and 143 out 
of 163 on the 2022 Global Peace Index) constitute direct threats to development and citizen trust 
in Nigerian public institutions and policies. Nigeria ranks 180 out of 193 countries in the world on 
women’s representation in parliament with only 5.8 per cent of female legislators in the House of 
Representatives and 7.3 per cent in the Senate. Nigeria also scored low on the gender development 
index (0.863) and the gender inequality index (0.680) in 2021. Female labour force participation is 
low at  59.6 per cent and  the maternal mortality ratio  is high (917).8 Furthermore, the pandemic 
intensified already  a  high  incidence of  gender-based violence (GBV), which is currently  48 per 
cent.9 
3.  The  Common  Country  Assessment  (CCA)  identifies  key  opportunities  in  agriculture, 
manufacturing,  and  regional  trade  alongside  challenges  such  as  vulnerability  to  oil  shocks, 
increasing  pressures  on  poverty,  inequality,  unemployment,  hunger,  malnutrition,  and  gender 
imbalances.  To  meet  the  ambitious  national  targets  of  generating  21  million  full-time  jobs  and 
lifting  35  million  people  out  of  poverty  by  2025  the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development 
Cooperation  Framework  (UNSDCF)  for  Nigeria  2023–2027  places  people  at  the  centre  of 
development  through  an  inclusive,  rights-based,  gender-sensitive  approach  to  achieve  the 
Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs).  The  UNSDCF  features  four  strategic  priorities,  (i) 
inclusive  economic  growth  and  development,  (ii)  improved  environmental  conditions  and 
increased resilience, (iii) increased access and use of quality basic social services, and (iv) promote 
a peaceful, inclusive, and cohesive society.  
4.  Anchored in the 2030 Agenda and African Union Agenda 2063, and drawing lessons from the 
mid-term review of the 2018-2022 Country Programme Document (CPD), the new CPD for 2023–
2027 represents UNDP contributions to Government of Nigeria development efforts and UNDSCF.  
The  CPD  is  aligned  to  the  National  Development  Plan 2021–2025,  which  aims  to  foster  socio-
economic recovery,  and restore macroeconomic stability, good  governance, and growth through 
socio-economic  transformation  for  sustainable  development.  The  CPD  was  informed  by  the 
analysis  and  recommendations  from  the  Independent  Country  Programme  Evaluation  (ICPE). 
These include adopting a balanced mix of upstream and downstream interventions where gender 
considerations  are  adequately  mainstreamed;  enhancing  peace  building  and  stabilization

programmes;  enabling  public‑private  partnerships  and  climate  change  mitigation  with  well-
articulated  strategies,  and  ensuring  sustainability  of  results  at  the  end  of  programme 
implementation.10 In achieving targets laid out in the UNDSCF and based on the UNDP mandate 
and comparative advantage, the CPD focuses on three pillars: (i) inclusive economic growth, (ii) 
climate change, and (iii) governance, peace, and security. These three pillars will collectively assist 
in  addressing  some  of  the  multi-faceted  and  multidimensional  challenges  identified  in  the 
UNDSCF, including rising unemployment, low productivity, public financial resource constraints, 
food  insecurity,  violence  and  conflict,  displacement  of  people,  limited  social  protection 
mechanisms,  low  public  accountability  and  transparency,  and  environmental  degradation  by 
promoting inclusive and rights-based development processes that leave no one behind. 
II.  Programme priorities and partnerships  
5.  The UNDP programmatic response in Nigeria has two objectives: socio-economic recovery in 
the medium term and structural transformation for inclusive and sustainable development to achieve 
the SDGs by 2030.  This is translated into the three linked priorities of inclusive growth, climate 
change, and governance, peace, and security. Adhering to the principle of “Leaving No One Behind” 
gender equality and empowerment will be prioritized along with vulnerable groups, poor, female-
headed households, and people living with disabilities. UNDP will mainstream volunteerism into 
programme  implementation  strategies  as  a  valuable  way  of  achieving  the  SDGs  by  2030.  The 
programme  is  flexible  and  responsive  to  addressing  emerging  issues  and  reflect  extensive 
collaborations with multiple stakeholders.  
6.  The  UNDP  CPD  for  2023  to  2027  contributes  to  the  United  Nations  development  system 
(UNDS) overall objective in the UNDSCF that promotes inclusive human-rights based and gender-
sensitive  development  in  Nigeria  for  the  acceleration  and  achievement  of  the  2030  Agenda  and 
African Union Agenda 2063. As such, UNDP will contribute to UNDS outcomes in the UNDSCF, 
by  focusing  on  (i)  establishing  a  strong  foundation  for  a  diversified  and  inclusive  economy,  (ii) 
building a solid framework and enhancing capacities to consolidate peace, strengthen security and 
social cohesion and ensure good governance, and (iii) enhancing capacities for climate resilience 
and sustainable access to energy. 
7.  The theory of change for the CPD is based on assumptions that these objectives can be achieved. 
IF  Nigeria  has  sustained  inclusive  economic  growth  and  development  that  provides  equitable 
opportunities for decent employment and livelihoods, and IF people living in Nigeria, particularly 
the most vulnerable, enjoy improved environmental conditions and increased resilience to extreme 
weather  conditions  and  disasters,  and  IF  more  inclusive,  participatory,  transparent  and  gender 
sensitive governance, justice and human rights systems are in place at all levels to promote peaceful, 
inclusive and cohesive society, and ASSUMING policy reforms, including strategies and plans are 
developed  and  implemented  effectively,  upcoming  elections  do  not  disrupt  programme 
implementation, rising insecurity within Nigeria and the Sahel region is under control, THEN all 
people living in Nigeria especially the most vulnerable, will contribute to and benefit from inclusive 
rights-based and gender sensitive development that leads to the acceleration and achievement of the 
2030 Agenda and SDGs. 
8.  The programme will focus on each of these directions to achieve greater development outcomes 
by  integrating  gender  equality  and  strengthening  partnerships  with  international  financial 
institutions  (IFIs),  donors,  and  the  private  sector  to  generate  meaningful  and  impactful 
programmatic interventions. Efforts will be facilitated by a greater focus on three enablers: Strategic 
innovation, digitization, and development financing. These chosen pathways are considered the best 
solutions for addressing development challenges in Nigeria, in part, considering the comparative 
advantage of UNDP in terms of convening power, strategic position, integrator role and its expertise 
in  thematic  areas  such  as  human  development,  development  financing,  inclusive  growth, 
environment,  governance  and  peace  building  as  evidenced  by  continuous  engagement  with  key 
 
10 ICPE Nigeria 2022 (summarized recommendations).

stakeholders including the government and donors. UNDP will work closely with United Nations 
agencies drawing lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. Taking note of CPD evaluation 
findings,  UNDP  will  make  greater  efforts 
transparent  engagement  and  programme 
implementation, fostering improved understanding amongst UNDS partners, and collaborating in 
thematic areas where possible, based on respective comparative advantages.  
in 
9.  Inclusive  economic  growth.  To  contribute  to  UNDSCF  Priority  Area  1  on  sustainable  and 
inclusive  growth,  UNDP  will  support  development  planning;  SDG  mainstreaming  and 
implementation in strategic plans and policies at federal and state levels; policy reforms guided by 
international best practices, economic analyses, and forecasting; data generation; inclusive finance 
and impact investments; leveraging the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, 
entrepreneurship development and employment creation through the SDG innovation Hub, Office 
of  the  Senior  Special  Assistant  to  the  President  on  SDGs  (OSSAP-SDGs),  Innovate  United 
Kingdom Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 
United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and the 
private  sector,  and  the  Accelerator  Lab  on  agriculture  and  value  chain  development  (especially 
involving women and youth).  Aims are to achieve  inclusive economic growth by strengthening 
capacities for generating and analyzing disaggregated data, especially at the National Bureau of 
Statistics  (NBS)  and  state  statistical  offices,  supporting  resilience-building  to  minimize  risk, 
improving  livelihood  and  employment  creation  by  leveraging  the  Nigeria  Jubilee  Fellows 
Programme,  and  scaling  up  social  protection  measures  such  as  cash  transfers  in  targeted 
communities in partnership with the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF.  
10.  Development financing challenges faced by Nigeria have driven UNDP  to partner with the 
government, European Union, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and other primary 
stakeholders in supporting the development of a healthy financial ecosystem through an Integrated 
National  Financial  Framework  (INFF)  and  related  economic  policy  reforms  and  institutional 
changes.  The  launch  of  the  INFF,  partly  through  South-South  cooperation,  will  see  Nigeria 
exchange lessons learned with other African countries on its successful INFF process. In addition, 
UNDP  will  prioritize  SDG  impact  investments  in  partnership  with  the  national  advisory  board, 
Impact  Investment  Foundation  (IIF),  German  Development  Agency  (GIZ),  United  Nations 
Industrial  Development  Organization  (UNIDO)  and  global  investors,  as  well  as  insurance  risk 
financers in collaboration with the Financial Sector Deepening Africa (FSD Africa) and Insurance 
Development  Forum  (IDF).  It  will  engage  in  high-level  policy  advocacy  through  the  United 
Nations  Nigeria  Policy  Advisors  group,  economic  analysis  and  forecasting  to  inform  effective 
policy choices by all stakeholders. 
11.  Environmental sustainability, climate change, and resilient development. UNDP, as the 
lead agency on clean energy and climate action under Priority Area 2 of the UNSDCF, will look to  
mitigate  climate  change  and  empower  communities  by  focusing  on  strengthening  the  nexus 
between economic growth, environmental protection, and security, relying on strategic partnerships 
with  the  Office  of  the  Vice  President,  National  Climate  Change  Council  of  Nigeria  (NCCCN), 
Ministry  of  Finance,  Budget,  and  National  Planning  (MFBNP),  Office  of  the  Security  Advisor 
(OSA),  Federal  Ministry  of  Environment  (FME),  Development  Bank  of  Nigeria  (DBN), 
Infrastructure Bank of Nigeria, and Bank of Industry. Climate-security nexus hubs piloted in the 
northwest of Nigeria, in partnership with development partners like  the governments of Norway 
and Germany, will be leveraged and scaled to foster resilience to shocks. 
12.  UNDP  will  support  the  Government  of  Nigeria  to  achieve  its  objective  of  greening  the 
economy using a set of integrated solutions as per five pathways. 
1)  Supporting  implementation  of  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (NDCs)  towards 
net zero and climate resilience using a broad range of policy options and leveraging the 
Montreal Protocol implementation. Partnerships will be deepened with the British Foreign, 
Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), United States Agency for International 
4/16  
22-27499 
 
 
DP/DCP/NGA/4 
 
Development (USAID), UNICEF, World Bank, and  Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO), tapping into innovation, advocacy, and capacity-building abilities. 
2)  Strengthening  mitigation  measures  to  climate  security  risks  by  enhancing  local 
capacities for proactive de-escalation of conflicts, stabilization, and recovery through youth 
engagement in peacebuilding and climate resilience. This also includes greening the Sahel 
for  sustainable  peace  in  alliance  with  the  Office  of  the  National  Security  Adviser  and 
providing platforms for scaling climate-peace hubs. 
3)  Accelerating  nature-based  sustainable  livelihoods  for  protecting biodiversity  and 
ecosystem  services  through  the  adoption  of  integrated,  effective,  protected  area 
management, enforcement, and sustainable land use agroecological approaches, especially 
targeting women and youth by leveraging the UNDP-led Global Biodiversity programme 
alongside the World Bank and FAO. 
4) Promoting risk-informed green and circular economic development through  emission 
trading  schemes,  scaling  up  access  to  clean  and  affordable  energy,  enhancing  de-
carbonization, de-risking private  investments  and off-grid clean  energy  technologies  for 
productive  uses  through  blended  finance,  and  focusing  on  rural  populations,  people 
affected by conflict or crisis, women and girls, people living with disabilities, and youth in 
collaboration  with  the  national  Rural  Electrification  Agency,  Energy  Commission  of 
Nigeria, and African Development Bank. 
5)  Enhancing  communication  and  data-driven  ecological  stewardship  for  strengthened 
dialogue between government, civil society, and the private sector.  
13.  Governance,  peace  and  security.  A  leading  organization  in  the  development  of  the 
UNSDCF, UNDP supports improved public confidence in key institutions of governance, enhances 
accountability,  public  sector  transparency,  security  and  conflict  management,  and  promotes 
inclusive  governance,  access  to  justice  and  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights.  As  such, 
partnerships with  civil society organizations (CSOs), the  private  sector, and professional bodies 
will  be  nurtured  to  support  engendering  progressive  views  on  public  accountability  and 
transparency, peacebuilding, elections, gender equality and social cohesion, and scaling up local 
governance  systems.  UNDP  will  enhance  the  capacities  of  the  national  assembly  and  primary 
public  finance  and  anti-corruption  agencies  to  enact  public  finance  and  anti-corruption  legal 
frameworks, collaborate with and empower CSOs, women, and youth groups for constructive and 
effective engagement on anti-corruption.  
14.  UNDP  will  support  efforts  aimed  at  promoting  equitable  and  timely  access  to  justice  and 
strengthen human rights institutions by investing in integrated digital solutions; encouraging the 
elimination  of  impunity  regarding  the  violation  of  human  rights  and  gender-based  violence; 
facilitating  domestication  of  all  international  and  regional  human  rights  treaties;  promoting 
elimination  of  inconsistencies  between  customary  practices  and  statutory  laws,  and  supporting 
implementation  of  international  and  regional  human  rights  recommendations  and  reporting 
obligations in partnership with the National Human Rights Commission, Ministry of Justice and 
relevant rule of law institutions. UNDP will prioritize electoral reforms and the implementation of 
the 2022 electoral law for improved election management and expanded democratic space. 
15.  UNDP will promote integrated responses to insecurity, linking peacebuilding, climate action 
and livelihood recovery to conflict prevention and stabilization. Infrastructure for peace, equipped 
with  functional  capacities  for  the  early  detection  of  conflict  risks,  will  be  strengthened  in 
collaboration  with  other  UNDS  partners,  CSOs,  traditional  and  religious  leaders  to  promote 
inclusive  dialogue,  build  consensus,  and  diffuse  societal  conflicts.  UNDP  will  enhance  the 
capacities  of  security  and  governance  institutions,  expanding  options  for  safe  return  and 
reintegration while laying the foundation for sustainable peace and national security. 
16.  To  address  cross  border  governance  challenges,  including  the  proliferation  of  small  arms, 
violent  extremism,  organised  crime,  and  illegal  migration  UNDP  will  collaborate  on  joint 
5/16 
22-27499 
 
DP/DCP/NGA/4 
 
 
programming  with  neighbouring  country offices,  Economic  Community  of  West  African  States 
(ECOWAS), Lake Chad Basin Commission, UNDS stakeholders, development partners, and CSOs 
on  area-based  responses  and  cost  sharing  arrangements  to  maximize  impact.  UNDP,  to  ensure 
connections across security, economic, environment, and governance pillars will work with other 
United Nations partners on preventing and responding to GBV, promote women’s participation in 
peace processes and security efforts, and improve the integration of gender equality into  natural 
resource  management  and  disaster  preparedness  plans  and  processes.  Furthermore,  UNDP  will 
promote  South-South  and  triangular  cooperation  with  stakeholders  from  Kenya,  Germany,  and 
China in governance thematic areas like police reform and elections to deepen best practices and 
exchange knowledge with ECOWAS. 
17.  UNDP will work with national partners  at  federal and  state levels, as well as  UN  Women, 
UNFPA, and UNICEF, in building national capacities to ensure gender equality is mainstreamed 
such that it contributes to policy reforms that address the barriers to women’s empowerment. UNDP 
will  support  strengthening  government  capacities  on  gender-sensitive  economic  policies, 
innovations, planning, and the use of gender-disaggregated data to strengthen efforts that empower 
women and leverage advantages to better respond to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) by 
supporting national and local partners in developing, strengthening and implementing the required 
legislative frameworks and building more gender-sensitive legal and judicial institutions. This will 
involve  UNDP  strengthening  the  evidence  base  to  inform  strategies  to  advance  women’s 
empowerment and gender equality, and support the country in producing nationwide data on SGBV 
for programming, analysis, and policymaking purposes in partnership with the Federal Ministry of 
Women Affairs. 
18.  UNDP  will  deepen  partnerships  with  development  partners,  namely  the  European  Union, 
governments of Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Korea, Canada, the United 
Kingdom, United States, and Global Environmental Facility (GEF)  and establish new ones with 
international financial institutions like the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), and 
the  Islamic  Development  Bank.  Cognizant  of  the  vibrancy  of  the  private  sector  in  Nigeria  in 
innovation,  development  financing,  impact  investments,  ease  of  doing  business,  job  creation, 
climate action and inclusive governance UNDP will further strengthen engagement with the private 
sector  to  build  more  ambitious  and  effective  partnerships.  Collaborative  opportunities  will  be 
explored  with  multilateral  environmental  financing  institutions  to  scale  up  engagements  with 
United Nations funds like the Peacebuilding Fund, Human Security Trust Fund, and the Joint SDG 
Fund.  Moreover,  UNDP  will  develop  long-term  partnerships  with  think  tanks,  chambers  of 
commerce,  innovation  hubs,  and  research  institutions  and  foster  lasting  technical  collaborative 
relationships with CSOs.  
III.  Programme and risk management 
19.  This CPD outlines UNDP contributions to national results and serves as the primary unit of 
accountability  to  the  Executive  Board  for  results  alignment  and  resources  assigned  to  the 
programme at the country level. In accordance with Executive Board decision 2013/9, UNDP will 
systematically  ensure  all  direct  costs  associated  with  project  implementation  are  charged  to 
concerned projects. In addition, UNDP will review structures and procedures to ensure they are “fit 
for purpose” when implementing the programme and agile enough to adapt to evolving contexts, 
United Nations reform actions and the new UNDP Strategic Plan for 2022–2025.  
20.  The  programme  will  be  nationally  executed  as  per  the  Harmonized  Approach  to  Cash 
Transfers (HACT) and in coordination with other United Nations Specialized Agencies to manage 
financial risks and strengthen national execution capacities. In exceptional circumstances, national 
execution  may  be  replaced  by  direct  execution  in  response  to  force  majeure.  UNDP  direct 
implementation will safeguard accountability in complex programming situations that is backed by 
conscious  data  collection  and  analysis,  and  aligned  with  effective  risk  management,  evidence 
generation,  and  adaptive  programmatic  implementation.  National  ownership  and  mutual 
6/16  
22-27499 
 
 
DP/DCP/NGA/4 
 
accountability for development results will be strengthened through joint annual work plans and 
reviews aligned with national priorities.  
21.  Risks associated with the management of political leadership transitions, including elections, 
could derail smooth implementation of the programme. Unrest or tensions related to elections could 
further polarize the operating environment, while protracted election processes could lead to  the 
unavailability of senior government officials with implications for the pace of realizing programme 
priorities  in  various  locations.  To  mitigate  risks,  UNDP  will  adopt  an  electoral-cycle  approach 
providing support to key stakeholders before, during and after  the elections. In addition, UNDP 
will deploy a  robust risk management system  to ensure adaptive programming strategies, direct 
implementation and working with strategic partners including civil society and volunteers so they 
have timely information that will lead to quick and meaningful programmatic decisions prior to, 
during, and after the elections.  
22.  Economic and social challenges may affect the successful implementation of the programme. 
Risks include, (i) prolonged economic slowdown if proposed strategies for economic stabilization 
are not implemented; (ii) limited capacity of government and national stakeholders to implement 
programmes; (iii) protracted crises in the north, south-east, Niger Delta, and the middle belt; (iv) 
difficulties in mobilizing adequate resources; (v) protracted COVID-19 related disruptions, and (vi) 
potential  delivery  challenges  prior  to  and  during  the  2023  general  elections.  Moreover,  lack  of 
political  will,  inadequate  allocation  of  resources,  and  adverse  societal  perceptions  on  gender 
equality,  especially  leadership  and  decision-making  related  interventions,  could  lead  to  risks 
relating to gender inequality and the situation of women and girls. 
23.  The mitigation of programme risks has been built into priorities and interventions. To ensure 
sustainability and effectiveness in the delivery of development and humanitarian assistance, UNDP 
will  focus  on  strengthening  the  capacities  of  government  and  implementing  partners  through  a 
HACT modality. This approach includes a macro-assessment of the public financial management 
system,  and  micro-assessments  of  implementing  partners.  Fast-track  procedures  will  meet 
government  demands  and  ensure  timely  responses  to  crisis  and  emergency  situations.  Surge 
capacity  and  high-level  advocacy,  among  other  contingency  measures,  will  be  considered  to 
mitigate contextual and operational risks by drawing on UNDP regional and global service hubs. 
24.  The  UNDP  partnership  and  resource  mobilization  strategy  will  emphasize  strengthening 
government capacities for domestic resource mobilization and cost sharing at the state level. UNDP 
will rely on its newly approved status as a ‘cluster for asset’ management in the region. Extensive 
collaboration with the Regional Service Centre will be used to collect and disseminate global best 
practices  for  South–South  cooperation,  innovation,  knowledge  management  and  thought 
leadership. 
IV. Monitoring and evaluation 
25.  CPD monitoring and evaluation will be aligned with the  UNSDCF. Following independent 
country  programme  evaluation,  the  focus  will  be  on  defining  results  and  baseline  data  and 
identifying  reliable  data  sources  for  collection  and  use.  In  line  with  UNDP  monitoring  and 
evaluation guidelines, UNDP will also engage third-party monitoring mechanisms for inaccessible 
areas. Field visits and verifications will increase in frequency to ensure targeted vulnerable groups 
benefit from interventions. 
26.  UNDP will rely on nationally owned country-level data sources such as the National Bureau 
of Statistics, Human Development Reports, and credible global reports. Data will be disaggregated 
by  relevant  groups  where  possible.  UNDP—working  with  the  United  Nations  Monitoring  and 
Evaluation Reference Group, third party monitors, joint field visits and partners—will support the 
national statistical system and research institutions to enhance national data generation capacities, 
and improve data quality and evaluation functions, and provide evidence-based, gender-sensitive 
data that informs decision-making and fosters transformational development approaches. The focus 
will  be  on  improving  coverage  of  SDG  targets  and  strengthening  the  quality,  reliability,  and 
7/16 
22-27499 
 
DP/DCP/NGA/4 
 
 
timeliness  of  disaggregated  data.  Performance  indicators  for  projects  and  programmes  will  be 
articulated to reflect changes on the ground and observable and measurable in ways that are relevant 
to  project  beneficiaries.  Two  per  cent  of  the  country  programme  budget  will  be  allocated  to 
evaluation. Project Quality Assessments, including the gender marker, will continue to be used to 
achieve corporate programming quality standards.  
27.  UNDP  will  participate  in  UNSDCF  Results  Area  Groups  to  track  outcome  indicators, 
including using the United Nations INFO online tool for planning, monitoring, and reporting on 
national  United  Nations  development  action.  The  gender  marker  will  be  used  to  monitor 
expenditure  and  improve  gender-based  planning and  decision-making.  HACT,  spot  checks,  and 
financial audits will complement regular programme monitoring for stakeholders. The approved 
evaluation  plan  will  be  the  basis  for  decentralized  evaluations,  the  next  independent  country 
programme evaluation, and the Cooperation Framework evaluation.
