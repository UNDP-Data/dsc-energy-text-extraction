Subject: Submission of SREP IP for Bangladesh 
I  am  pleased  to  submit  the  Investment  Plan  (IP)  of 
Bangladesh’s Scaling-Up Renewable Energy Program (SREP) 
to  the  SREP  Sub-Committee  for  endorsement.  The  SREP 
in 
Investment  Plan 
collaboration  and  consultation  with  representatives  from 
Government, particularly with the Sustainable and Renewable 
Energy Development Authority (SREDA), private industries, 
academia  and  with  the  expertise  and  support  of  our 
development  partners,  the  World  Bank  Group  and  Asian 
Development Bank.  
for  Bangladesh  has  developed 
The  Government  of  Bangladesh  is  committed  to  the  development  of  a  stable  and 
sustainable power supply that will increase electricity access, enhance energy security, 
reduce poverty and mitigate climate change. The Government recognizes the important 
role that renewable energy can play in achieving these goals. The Government has set 
a goal of total electrification by 2020, and has called for the development of domestic 
renewable energy resources to ensure that the share of domestic energy supply would 
remain over 50 percent. Renewable energy resources will ensure a stable and universal 
power supply that will reduce poverty by sustainable socio-economic growth. Though 
Bangladesh has a negligible carbon footprint, but remains one of the most vulnerable 
nations in the world for the effect of climate change, and we recognize the important 
role that renewable energy can play in reducing associated risks.  
This Investment Plan identifies the renewable energy technologies and projects that can 
be  best  contributed  to  the  Government’s  energy  and  economic  goals.  It  outlines  the 
activities that must be carried out to develop technologies that have enormous potential 
to  integrate  renewable  energy  into  the  grid,  and  to  expand  our  successful  off-grid 
electrification programs. SREP will support the Government in reaching its goals for 
the  energy  sector,  and  help  leverage  private  sector  funds  to  expand  investment  in 
domestic renewable energy resources substantially. 
Government of Bangladesh looks forward to the support of SREP for this Investment 
Plan  (IP)  and  to  work  with  our  development  partners  to  successfully  implement  the 
projects and programs identified herein.

This document contains the Investment Plan (IP) for Bangladesh. The IP is the result 
of extensive analysis by the Sustainable & Renewable Energy Development Authority 
(SREDA),  and  a  wide-reaching  internal  and  public  consultation  process,  also  led  by 
SREDA, to identify priorities in the development of renewable energy technologies for 
electricity  generation.  The  consultations  included  a  wide  range  of  government 
agencies,  as  well  as  representatives  from  the  private  sector,  civil  society,  and 
academia. 
Investment Plan Summary 
The  Investment  Plan,  if  implemented,  will  be  transformational  for  Bangladesh, 
launching an aggressive drive toward the integration of renewable energy generation 
into the grid, and a continued expansion of the off-grid electrification programs with 
which Bangladesh has had so much success in the past. 
1.1  Context 
Bangladesh is a low lying country located on the Ganges Delta. Seventy-five percent 
of the country is less than 10 meters above sea level and more than 700 rivers run 
through its borders. Approximately 144 million people live in a total area of 147,500 
square kilometers, giving it the highest population density in the world among large 
countries, and twelfth highest overall (976 people per km2). About 23 percent of the 
population is urban, with the remaining 77 percent living in rural areas.  
Poverty in Bangladesh is widespread, but on the decline. In 2015, about 25 percent of 
the population lived below the national poverty line, down from 32 percent in 2010 
and 49 percent in 2000. Despite this considerable improvement, Bangladesh still has 
substantially higher poverty rates (in terms of purchasing power parity, or PPP) than 
other  countries  in  the  South  Asia  region.  Bangladesh  had  a  poverty  rate  of  43.3 
percent  in  2010  (in  terms  of  purchasing  power  parity,  or  PPP),  while  the  regional 
average was just 24.5 percent. The incidence of poverty in Bangladesh is highest in the 
Rangpur and Barisal administrative divisions and northern Dhaka. 
Nationwide, 74 percent of the population has access to electricity (up from only about 
20 percent in 1990).1 Electrification rates are highest in urban areas, where only about 
one percent lack access to electricity. In rural areas, 34 percent do not have electricity. 
Electrification rates have improved in recent years  because of rapid acceleration of 
grid connection to rural areas, coupled with the installation of solar home systems—
since  2003,  about  3.8  million  solar  home  systems  have  been  installed,  benefiting 
about 20 million people. 
The majority of electricity is supplied through gas-powered thermal generation. Rental 
power producers (RPPs) using diesel generators have been contracted to meet peak 
demand in the summer. Electricity has also been imported from India since September 
2013. In terms of renewable energy (RE), hydropower is the primary grid-connected 
RE source.

1.2 
The  energy  sector  in  Bangladesh  faces  important  challenges  which  include,  among 
others, limited availability of indigenous hydrocarbon resources, limited access to the 
electricity  network,  and  climate  change.  Government  has  been  trying  to  mitigate 
these challenges by undertaking plans and programs to ensure supply of electricity 
according to demand and to maintain a steady GDP growth rate of over six percent 
for  the  next  few  years.  The  Power  System  Master  Plan  2010  set  goals  for  fuel 
diversification  with  an  emphasis  on  increasing  the  role  of  renewable  energy  in  the 
power generation mix.   
The Context for SREP Involvement 
Access to Electricity 
The  primary  challenge  in  the  Bangladesh  energy  sector  is  to  provide  universal 
electricity  access  by  2021,  in  line  with  Government targets.  The  lack  of service  has 
economic consequences for some of the poorest regions in the country. According to 
the 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey, Barisal and Rangpur divisions—
the divisions with the highest incidence of poverty—have the lowest percentage of 
rural households with access to electricity, at 32 and 24 percent, respectively, though 
these electrification rates are improving substantially. In 2010, Rangpur division also 
had the lowest urban electrification rate, at just 69 percent, compared to the  2010 
national rate of 88 percent.  
Energy Security 
Bangladesh  faces  challenges  in  the  form  of  natural  gas  depletion  and  biomass 
availability. It has been estimated that Bangladesh’s natural gas reserves will begin to 
deplete in 2020 if no new gas reserves are discovered or if technology does not allow 
a higher rate of extraction from existing gas fields. The uncertainty about reserves has 
limited  the  development  of  gas-based  power  generation  programs.  Biomass  is 
becoming  scarcer  and  more  expensive,  which  negatively  impacts  poor  households 
that  rely  on  this  fuel  source.  More  than  90  percent  of  Bangladesh  households  use 
traditional biomass for cooking, and biomass accounts for 50 percent of Bangladesh’s 
total energy supply. The common fuels used are rice husks, jute sticks, cow dung and 
wood. 
Declining  indigenous  resources  and  increasing  demand  has  caused  Bangladesh  to 
increasingly  depend  on  imported  fuel  oil.  The  increase  in  fuel  oil  consumption  has 
been driven by increased reliance on fuel oil for power generation to mitigate energy 
shortages. From 2009 to 2015, the share of oil-fired electricity has increased from 5 to 
20 percent. This increase in oil-fired electricity contributed to the fuel cost per kWh 
generated going from 1.1 to 3.42 taka/kWh (US$ 0.014 to US$ 0.04) over the same 
period.2 This leaves Bangladesh’s energy sector vulnerable to political and economic 
instability in nations from which it imports fuel, as well as rising prices generally.   
Climate Change 
Bangladesh is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change, despite 
its negligible carbon footprint. As a low-lying country with many rivers, Bangladesh 
has a very high flood risk, both due to monsoons and sea-level rise associated with

climate change. Rising temperatures have already begun to shorten the life cycle of 
rice; reducing yields. Low crop production could increase poverty up to 15 percent by 
2030. Higher water levels could lead to higher incidence of waterborne disease, such 
as cholera, and result in forced migration due to flooding.3 
The World Bank has noted that Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to an increase in 
poverty headcount rate and risk of chronic poverty as a result of different warming 
scenarios. Climate change could also reduce the availability of clean water supply and 
sanitation.4  
The World Risk Report ranks Bangladesh as the fifth most vulnerable country in the 
world  to  climate  change.5 In  addition,  the  Climate  Change  Vulnerability  Index  rates 
Dhaka  as  one  of  the  five  most  climate-vulnerable  cities  in  the  world.  Bangladesh 
addresses climate change issues through the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and 
Action  Plan,  which  is  implemented  through  the  donor-funded  Bangladesh  Climate 
Change Resilience Fund.  
1.3  Renewable Energy in Bangladesh 
Bangladesh  has  considerable  renewable  energy  potential,  and  significant  past 
experience  in  developing  renewable  energy  projects.  Most  of  the  existing  RE 
investment has been in off-grid technologies such as solar home systems (SHS), solar 
microgrids, and solar irrigation pumps. The GoB has set several investment targets for 
grid-connected technologies including utility-scale solar, wind, and waste-to-energy. 
Despite  significant  potential  the  development  of  these  grid-connected  renewable 
energy technologies, however, has been slow to materialize.    
There are a number of regulatory, financial and technical barriers that, if addressed, 
could accelerate renewable energy investment in Bangladesh. Improved regulations, 
such  as  establishment  of  a  formal  feed-in  tariff  and  provisions  for  compensating 
minigrid investors after transmission expansion, would reduce risk and send strong 
signals  to  investors.  Grant  funding  and  low  interest  financing  can  help  address 
concerns about affordability for both grid-connected and off-grid projects. Reduced 
financing costs can also offset the high cost of procuring land for projects, land scarcity 
being one of the key barriers to investment. Overall the paradox of the investment 
situation  is  that  increased  experience  with  renewable  energy  projects  will  lead  to 
increased investment. Successful renewable projects will provide better access to data 
on renewable energy; demonstrate successful business models that can be replicated 
by  local  banks;  and  allow  local  workers  the  opportunity  to  learn  the  necessary 
technical skills. 
The GoB has two sets of directives for renewable energy investment. The first is the 
500 MW Solar Program, developed in 2012. The objective of the program is to add 500

MW of solar generation capacity by 2016 through financing and implementing solar-
powered  projects  in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors.  The  GoB  has  also  set 
renewable energy development targets for several technologies for each year from 
2015 to  2021  (“RE Development  Targets”). The RE  Development Targets  call  for  an 
additional 3,100 MW of RE capacity to be installed by 2021. Most of the new capacity 
will  be  provided  by  solar  (1,676  MW,  or  54  percent)  and  wind  (1,370  MW,  or  44 
percent). There are also targets for waste-to-energy (40 MW), biomass (7 MW), biogas 
(7 MW) and hydro (4 MW). 
SREP  could  play  a  major  role  in  addressing  some  of  the  investment  barriers  and 
support  the  GoB’s  renewable  energy  goals.  SREP  funds  would  be  used  to  kick-start 
investment in the government priority areas of utility-scale projects and off-grid solar. 
Grants and low cost financing can be used to attract early investors into an unproven 
market and keep the cost of energy more affordable for customers. The successful 
projects developed using SREP funds will then demonstrate the potential for scaling 
up projects and attract other investors into the market.  
1.4 
Each of the potential renewable energy resources were evaluated against national and 
SREP  criteria,  and  prioritized  accordingly.  The  criteria  reflect  the  Government’s 
strategic  objectives, and  the  clear  recognition  that  SREP  funding  should be used  to 
overcome  barriers  to  technologies  that  will  have  the  potential  to  have  a 
transformative  impact  on  the  energy  sector.  The  criteria  considered  included: 
scalability  (the  amount  of  developable  resource  potential  relative  to  other 
technologies),  availability  of  sites,  unexploited  market  potential,  readiness  for 
implementation and financial viability.  
The Proposed Investment Program for Bangladesh 
The prioritization exercise has led to the selection of three areas where Government 
will request SREP support: 
  Grid-connected renewable energy, which includes a combined 200 MW in 
utility-scale solar PV and grid-connected rooftop solar PV. If wind resources 
prove to be sufficient, and there is private sector interest, the SREP funds 
could also be used for a grid-connected wind project 
  Off-grid  solar PV,  which includes  6  MW  in  solar irrigation,  and  25 MW  in 
mini/microgrids 
  Advisory support in preparing a municipal waste-to-energy project. 
Table 1.1 presents a plan for financing the projects described in Section 5. It shows the 
proposed  credits  and  grants  from  SREP  as  well  as  estimates  of  the  amounts 
anticipated from MDBs and the private sector.  
As the table shows, roughly US$ 75 million of SREP funding is expected to catalyse 
over eight times as much investment, most of it from the private sector (as equity or 
debt), and the public sector lending windows of the MDBs. 
The exact financing modalities will be determined at the time of appraisal, but it is 
expected that: 
  Roughly  US$44.45  million  of  SREP  funding  would  be  used  to  leverage 
US$100 million in IDA financing from the World Bank, US$100 million in a 
4 
 
 
partial  risk  guarantee  (PRG) or  similar instrument  if  needed,  $30m  of  IFC 
investment,  and  US$190  million  in  investment  from  other  private  sector 
investors  for  utility-scale  renewable  energy  plants  (primarily  solar  but 
possibly also wind), and rooftop solar. IFC’s assistance would also be sought 
for  additional  technical  assistance  on  possible  business  models  or 
transaction  advisory  on  structuring  of  the  PPP  arrangement  under  which 
private operators would be selected. 
  Roughly US$29.95 million of SREP grant funding would be used to leverage 
US$140 million in concessional financing from ADB for solar irrigation and 
hybrid minigrid projects. 
  The World Bank would provide support for an assessment of technical and 
commercial feasibility of a municipal waste-to-energy project. 
The Government of Bangladesh will contribute by facilitating fiscal incentives for 
services associated with the financing plan.

Bangladesh is a low lying country located on the Ganges Delta. Seventy-five percent 
of the country is less than 10 meters above sea level and more than 700 rivers run 
through its borders. The Chittagong Hill Tracts, Low Hills of Sylhet and the highlands 
in Rangpur are the highest points of elevation. Bangladesh has more than 580 km of 
coastline, and 32 islands in the Bay of Bengal and Padma River.  
Country Context 
According to the 2011 census, approximately 144 million people live in a total area of 
147,500  km2,  giving  it  the  highest  population  density  in  the  world  among  large 
countries, and twelfth highest overall (976 people per km2). Roughly 23 percent of the 
population is urban, with the remaining  77 percent living in rural areas. The largest 
cities are Dhaka, the capital (7.03 million), and Chittagong (2.59 million). Population 
density  of the  administrative  divisions  ranges  from  a  low  of  630 people  per  km2  in 
Barisal Division to a high of 1,521 people per km2 in Dhaka Division. Figure 2.1 below 
shows  the  administrative  divisions  of  Bangladesh,  along  with  relevant  population

Bangladesh is classified as a developing economy by the IMF. Its economic growth has 
averaged  nearly  six  percent  per  year  since  1996.  Bangladesh’s  GDP  was  US$  196.6 
billion in Fiscal Year 2014-2015, with manufacturing (17 percent), motor vehicles (13 
percent), service (13 percent), and agriculture (12 percent) being the largest  value-

added sectors.6 The economy lost about US$ 2.2 billion (about 1 percent of GDP) as a 
result of political unrest in 2013 and January 2015, but economic growth in Bangladesh 
has largely been resistant to political instability, natural disasters, poor infrastructure 
and global shocks.7 Bangladesh was less affected by the global financial crisis because 
of  increased  international  demand  for  low-cost  exports,  and  remittance  growth  of 
22.5 percent in 2008-2009.8 Figure 2.2 below shows the actual and projected annual 
change in real GDP and annual inflation from 2000 to 2020. Inflation in Bangladesh 
has been constrained by reduced global oil prices and conservative monetary policies.  
Figure 2.2: Annual Change in Real GDP and Inflation, 2000-2020 
 
Source: IMF World Economic Outlook (April 2015). 
 
The  economy  added  1.3  million  jobs  per  year  from  2010  to  2013.  The  national 
unemployment  rate  is  five  percent,  but  underemployment  rates  are  much  higher. 
Important  employment  sectors  include  agriculture  (54  percent);  trade,  hotel  and 
restaurant  (16  percent);  and  manufacturing  (12  percent).  About  86  percent  of 
employment is informal.9 
2.2  Poverty 
Poverty in Bangladesh is widespread, but on the decline. In 2015, about 25 percent of 
the population lived below the national poverty line, down from 32 percent in 2010 
and 49 percent in 2000.10 Despite this considerable improvement, Bangladesh still has 
scope to reduce poverty rates. Figure 2.3 shows poverty rates in South Asia in terms 
of purchasing power parity, or PPP, where the poor are defined as those who earn less 
than US$ 1.25 per day PPP. The horizontal line represents the 2011 regional average 
of 24.5 percent. Using this indicator, Bangladesh had a poverty rate of 43.3 percent in 
2010.  The  incidence  of poverty  in  Bangladesh  is  highest  in  the  Rangpur and  Barisal 
administrative divisions and northern Dhaka.

Indigenous fossil fuel supply in Bangladesh is comprised of natural gas, coal and oil 
products. There are 21 natural gas fields in Bangladesh, operated by three national 
and  two  international  companies. 11  There  are  five  coalfields  in  Bangladesh,  in 
Barapukuria, Khalaspir, Jamalganj, Fulbari and Dighipara.12 In 2012, Bangladesh struck 
its  first  oil  in  two  fields  in  Sylhet. 13 In  2013,  Bangladesh  produced  21,000  ktoe  of 
natural gas (up from 18,000 ktoe in 2010), 400 ktoe of coal and 200 ktoe of oil.14 
Energy Supply and Demand 
Natural gas and biofuels are the main sources of energy in Bangladesh. Primary energy 
consumption  increased  74  percent  from  2000  to  2012,  with  natural  gas  and  coal 
consumption growing at the fastest rates (see Figure 2.4).

Biofuels  remain  the  main  source  of  energy  for  residential  consumers;  however 
consumption patterns have changed in recent years. Biofuels as a percentage of total 
residential consumption decreased from 81 to 70 percent between 2000 and 2012. 
Electricity  increased  from  five  to  ten  percent  of  consumption,  and  natural  gas 
increased  from  seven  to  16  percent  of  consumption,  replacing  the  consumption  of 
biofuels (see Figure 2.5).

2.4.3  Government Plans 
The GoB has two sets of directives for renewable energy investment. The GoB has set 
renewable energy development targets for several technologies for each year from 
2015  to 2021  (“RE  Development  Targets”).  The RE  Development  Targets  call for  an 
additional 3,100 MW of RE capacity to be installed by 2021. Most of the new capacity 
will  be  provided  by  solar  (1,676  MW,  or  54  percent)  and  wind  (1,370  MW,  or  44 
percent).  There  are  also  targets  for  biomass  (47  MW),  biogas  (7  MW)  and 
hydroelectricity  (4  MW).  Figure  2.6  shows  the  RE  development  targets  for  each 
technology from 2015 to 2021. 
Figure 2.6: RE Development Targets, 2015-2021 
  
Source: Based on information provided by SREDA. 
 
The  RE  Development  Targets  propose  three  models  for  investment  in  utility-scale 
parks  and  wind  farms:  GoB  investment  on  government  owned  land;  independent 
power  producer  (IPP)  investment  on  government  land;  and  private  investment  on 
private  land.  The  current  plan  for  procuring  the  private  sector  projects  is  to  hold 
auctions  for  IPP  investment  on  government  land  and  to  negotiate  fixed  tariff 
for  private  investment  on  private  land.  Feed-in-tariffs  are  an  option  that  may  be 
considered for these projects but are currently being considered just for small-scale 
generation and microgrid projects. 
Table 2.3 shows the targets for new capacity of solar parks and wind farms (in MW) 
via each of these implementation models from 2015 to 2021.

The second directive is the 500 MW Solar Program, developed in 2012. The objective 
of  the  program  is  to  add  500  MW  of  solar  generation  capacity  by  2016  through 
financing  and  implementing  solar-powered  projects  in  both  the  public  and  private 
sectors.  The  program  will  help  the  GoB  achieve  the  goals  set  out  in  its  Renewable 
Energy Policy (2008) for the percentage of electricity to be generated from renewable 
sources (five percent by 2015 and 10 percent by 2020). Figure 2.7 shows a breakdown 
of the installation goals of the program by application.

The  following  sub-sections  provide  a  summary  of  important  characteristics  of  the 
legal, regulatory, and institutional framework of Bangladesh’s energy sector. Section 
2.5.1 provides information on important institutions in the energy sector, including 
generation, distribution and  transmission  companies and their assets.  Section  2.5.2 
summarizes  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  in  the  energy  sector  in 
Bangladesh. 
Legal, Regulatory and Institutional Framework 
15 
 
 
2.5.1 
Institutional Framework in the Energy Sector 
There are several important institutions responsible for energy policy and regulation 
in  Bangladesh.  Figure  2.8  below  shows  their  responsibilities  and  the  relationships 
between the institutions. 
Figure 2.8: Energy Policy and Regulatory Entities

Note: Although NWZPDCL and SZPDCL are not yet operational, BPDB is still providing distributional 
services to customers in the Northwest and Southwest zones. Those distribution duties and 
assets will later be transferred to the individual entities. 
 
Generation 
The Power Development Board (BPDB) and its affiliates operate 5,803 MW (about 53 
percent) of installed capacity. Rental power producers (RPPs) have been contracted 
on three-, five- and 15-year contracts to address power shortages. Figure 2.10 below 
shows installed grid-connected capacity by owner.

2.6  Access to Electricity 
Rapid  urbanization  is  causing  demand  growth,  but  supply  improvements  have  not 
been able to keep pace. The Government has set a target for nationwide electricity 
access of 90 percent by 2018.  Nationwide, 74 percent have access to electricity (as of 
September 2015), up from about 20 percent in 1990.16 Most of the urban population 
has electricity access (nearly 99 percent). In rural areas, electricity access, including 
solar home systems, is 66 percent. The Rural Electrification Board (REB) has historically 
averaged 90,000 connections per month, but this has increased to nearly 300,000 new 
connections per month in summer 2015. To achieve the 2018 target, this connection 
rate has to rise to 450,000 new household connections per month. Figure 2.11 shows 
electricity access rates for the urban, rural and total population in 2015. Figure 2.12 
presents the change in access to electricity from 1990 to 2015.

Natural gas fueled turbines make up 62 percent of Bangladesh’s installed generation 
capacity,  these  plants  represented  69.5  percent  of  electricity  production  in  2015. 
Rental power producers (RPPs) using diesel generators have been contracted to meet 
peak  demand  in  the  summer.  Electricity  has  also  been  imported  from  India  since 
September 2013. In terms of renewable energy (RE), hydropower is the primary grid-
connected RE source (see Figure 2.13). 
Electricity Supply and Demand

The most common fuel type for generation in Bangladesh is natural gas, which makes 
up  62  percent  of  total-grid  connected  capacity.  This  is  followed  by  furnace  oil  (21 
percent)  and  diesel  (8  percent).  Figure  2.14  shows  the  installed  grid-connected 
capacity  by  fuel  type.  Installed  off-grid  capacity  includes  solar  home  systems  (150 
MW), electricity from biogas and biomass (6 MW), wind (2 MW) and rooftop solar PV 
(14 MW)17.
                                                      
17 The  currently  installed  rooftop  PV  installations  are  mostly  for  on-site  use  and  not  connected  to  the  grid  (an 
exception is the 50 kWp solar installation on the Secretariat building). These installations are the result of the 
government requirement for a certain percentage of lighting loads to come from solar for getting a new grid 
connection.  In  the  absence  of  a  clear  regulation  and  lack  of  inspection  and  monitoring,  many  of  these 
installations are reported to be put up merely to satisfy the requirements for getting a new grid connection, and 
are not up to standards to produce any meaningful energy.

Electricity demand peaks in the summer months, at over 7,000 MW (see Figure 2.15). 
The system load factor is 0.71. Daily demand typically peaks between 5PM and 11PM. 
Figure 2.15: Peak Demand by Month and Average Demand by Hour, 2014

New  capacity  from  IPPs  and  RPPs  have  improved  power  supply  in  recent  times. 
Maximum  load  shed  has  declined  since  May  2012,  and  total  load  shed  days  has 
decreased (see Figure 2.16). Despite the decline in load shed, unserved energy from 
transmission  failures  has  increased  61  percent—a  2,155  MW  jump—from  2013  to 
2014.  Unserved  energy  has  continued  to  rise  in  the  first  five  months  of  2015, 
increasing nine percent over the same period in 2014. While RPPs have added much-
needed  capacity,  they  do  not  represent  a  sustainable  long-term  solution  to  energy 
shortfalls.  Their  ability  to  meet  energy  shortfalls  quickly  makes  them  an  attractive 
option, but not a long-term solution. Moreover, RPP costs increase with the price of 
imported oil.

Additional  capacity  investments  are  needed  for  supply  reliability  to  continue  to 
improve. Sustained GDP growth of six percent per year could lead to an increase in 
annual demand  of  62 percent  by  2020  and 207  percent  by  2030.  If power  demand 
continues to grow at the projected rate, an average of 829 MW per year needs to be 
installed over the next 15 years to meet peak demand in 2030 (see Figure 2.17).

2.8 
The approach for setting electricity tariffs was established in the Bangladesh  Energy 
Regulatory  Act  (2003).  The  Act  calls  for  BERC  to  set  tariffs,  tariff  policy  and 
methodology  in  consultation  with  GoB.  As  part  of  this  role  BERC  has  established 
procedures for the following tariffs: 
Electricity Tariffs 
   BPDB  Bulk  Supply.  BERC  sets  the  price  BPDB  uses  to  sell  energy  to  the 
distribution  companies.  The  tariff  is  supposed  to  cover  the  expenses 
incurred by BPDB in operating their own power plants and also the cost of 
29 
 
 
procuring energy from IPPs and RPPs. The difference between the cost of 
power purchase by BPDB and the bulk supply tariff at which BPDB sells to 
the distribution utilities is provided by the Government as direct budgetary 
transfer to BPDB.18 Procurement and price negotiations between IPPs, RPPs, 
and developers of publically-owned power plants must be in line with Public 
Procurement Rules (PPR) (2008). Procurement processes under the PPR are 
summarized in Box 2.1.19 
  PGCB Wheeling Charges. Price paid by distribution companies to PGCB for 
delivery over the high-voltage transmission network.  
  End-User Tariffs. BERC also sets tariffs for the distribution companies. BERC 
receives tariff applications from the distribution companies periodically and 
performs due diligence, including conducting open public hearings, before 
issuing a tariff order.  
The  Power  Pricing  Framework  (2004)  established  the  distribution  tariff-setting 
methodology.  According  to  the  Framework,  the  average  end-use  tariff  for  each 
customer category20 should cover the costs of supplying power to those customers, 
including generation, distribution, transmission and maintenance costs. It should also 
provide  some  extra  funding  for  coverage  expansion  and  quality  improvement.  Any 
subsidies for consumer types are to be taken directly from the budget. In addition, 
tariffs  should  incentivize  technological  improvement  and  efficiency.  Rates  are 
different for peak and off-peak hours. For BPDB’s generation, a two-part tariff will be 
introduced—one to cover fixed costs and the other to cover variable costs. 
 
                                                      
18 In FY2014, this transfer amounted to about US$ 800 million, compared to US$ 584 million in FY2013 and US$ 
840 million in FY2012. Government has a target to keep the transfer within BDT 60 million (or about US$ 770 
million) for FY2015. 
19 Exceptions to the PPR are allowed for certain periods to expedite installation of power plants under the Power 
and Energy Fast Supply Enhancement (Special Provision) Act (2010). 
20 Customer categories include domestic, agriculture, small industry, non-residential, commercial, medium voltage, 
high voltage, extra high voltage and street lights and pumps. 
30 
 
 
Box 2.1: Public Procurement Rules in Bangladesh 
Bangladesh’s  Public  Procurement  Rules  (2008)  provide  for  several  methods  of 
procurement: 
  Open tendering: competition open to all interested firms via public advertisement; 
  Limited tendering: competition limited to those directly invited to tender; 
  Two-stage tendering: open, publicly advertised tendering in which an initial unpriced 
technical proposal is submitted and evaluated for compliance and responsiveness; all 
responsive tenderers from the first stage are invited to submit priced tenders; 
  Single stage two envelope tendering: similar to two-stage tendering, but technical and 
financial proposals are submitted simultaneously in separate envelopes; 
  Request  for  quotation  (RFQ):  simplified  tender,  advertised  on  company  website, 
requesting quotations for low-value goods and services; 
  Direct  procurement:  procuring  entity  requests  a  priced  offer,  subject  to  negotiation, 
from  a  tenderer  directly,  without  competition,  for  proprietary,  exclusive  or  urgently 
needed goods and services; 
  Request for proposals (RFP): technical and financial proposals used for procurement of 
intellectual  and  professional  services,  sent  to  short-listed  applicants  and  evaluated 
based on specific experience of the applicants, adequacy of methodology and work plan 
proposed, and qualification of key staff. Applicants meeting a minimum technical score 
are then evaluated on their financial proposals, and technical and financial scores are 
combined to select an Applicant for further negotiations. 
Recent BPDB projects (for their own plants) have been procured through either open tender 
or  single-stage two  envelope  processes.  IPPs  tend  to  be  procured  using  an  RFP  under  a 
Build-Own-Operate  (BOO)  model.  IPPs  involve  three  contracts:  (i)  a  power  purchase 
agreement (PPA) with BPDB where BPDB is required to purchase the power produced by 
the IPP; (ii) a fuel supply agreement with the fuel supplier guaranteeing uninterrupted fuel 
supply; and (iii) an implementation agreement with GoB that backstops BDPB’s payment 
commitment and provides fiscal incentives to facilitate the project. IPP tenures range from 
seven to 22 years. RPPs follow a competitive bidding process, but QRPPs are awarded based 
on negotiation. RPP contracts range from three to 12 years. RPPs operate under a “must 
dispatch” obligation up to their declared capacity. 
 
End-user  tariffs  vary  by  customer  category.  Domestic  consumers  have  incremental 
block tariffs (IBT) that increase based on kWh increments or “slabs.” The lifeline tariff 
for residential customers was reduced to 50 kWh per month. Figure 2.18 shows the 
average residential tariff by monthly consumption from 2010 to 2014.  
31 
 
 
Figure 2.18: Average Residential Tariff by Monthly Consumption, 2010-2015 
 
Source: BERC 
 
Agricultural  pumps,  non-residential  customers,  street  lights  and  pumps  all  have  a 
single rate. Small industry, commercial and medium/high/extra-high voltage have flat, 
off-peak  and  peak  rates.  Rural  rates  through  REB  vary  from  those  from  urban 
customers. 
Tariffs  are  set  such  that  commercial  and  industrial  customers  (C&I)  and  high  use 
residential customers subsidize low use residential and agricultural users. Figure 2.19 
shows BPDB’s tariffs versus the actual cost of delivery by consumer group. Note that 
the cost of delivery as shown is based on the costs incurred by BPDB in FY 2013-2014. 
These costs are understated because the cost of fuel is subsidized. Before the latest 
drop in international prices of fuel, Government used to provide about US$ 800 million 
in annual subsidies for fossil fuels, with the power sector accounting for about one-
third of fossil fuel consumption.

Cross-subsidies are not enough to cover the lost revenue for selling the majority of 
electricity  at  below-cost  recovery.  The  average  retail  tariff  (6.2  taka/kWh)  in 
FY 2013-2014 was 16.7 percent below the total delivery cost (7.25 taka/kWh).  As a 
result  only  PGCB  operated  with  a  net  operating  profit  over  that  fiscal  year.  BPDB 
suffered  high  losses  for  both  generation  and  distribution  services,  while  the 
distribution  only  companies  had  moderate  losses.  Figure  2.20  presents  the  net 
operating profit (loss) for the power sector companies in FY 2013-2014.

Two  of  the  most  significant  challenges  facing  the  Bangladesh  energy  sector  are 
provision of electricity access to the rural population and improving energy security. 
SREP funds could potentially address both these challenges.  
Sector Challenges 
2.9.1  Challenge #1: Rural Access to Electricity 
The  substantial  number  of  rural  citizens  without  access  to  electricity  is  one  of  the 
primary challenges in the Bangladesh energy sector. The lack of service has economic 
consequences for some of the poorest regions in the country. According to the 2010 
Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey,  Barisal  and  Rangpur  divisions—the 
divisions with the highest incidence of poverty—have the lowest percentage of rural 
households with access to electricity, at 32 and 24 percent, respectively, though these 
rates  have  been  improving.  Figure  2.21  shows  the  percentage  of  urban  and  rural 
households in 2010 with access to electricity by division. National access rates have 
since improved to 99 percent urban and 66 percent rural, but there is no new data for 
access rates by division. The GoB has goals to provide access to electric services to all 
citizens in rural areas by 2021. SREP funds can help achieve this goal by supporting 
investments in off-grid solar PV generation in rural areas without the potential for grid 
connection.

2010”. 
 
2.9.2  Challenge #2: Energy Security  
Energy security in Bangladesh is threatened by shortages in generation supply and a 
limited  availability  of  domestic  natural  resources.  The  power  sector  has  historically 
had  difficulty  keeping  up  with  the  rapid  growth  in  demand  and  load  shedding  is 
regularly  needed  during  peak  hours.  As  discussed  in  Section  2.7  this  situation  has 
improved in recent years. Days with load shedding decreased from 284 days in 2012 
to 84 in 2014. The trend has continued through the first eight months of 2015 with 
only four load shed days. The supply-demand gap is being addressed partly with new 
baseload gas and coal plants. However, most of the gap has been filled with more than 
2000 MW  of  rental  power  units  procured  on  three  to  five  year  contracts.  The 
increased dependence on these—typically oil fired—units has implications on the cost 
of generation. From 2009 to 2015, the share of oil-fired electricity has increased from 
5 to 20 percent. This increase in oil-fired electricity contributed to the fuel cost per 
kWh  generated  going from  1.1  to  3.42  taka/kWh  (US$ 0.014  to  US$ 0.04)  over the 
same period.21 With demand anticipated to grow at the current level of eight percent 
per year and ambitious electrification goals adding to this growth, SREP funds could 
help  develop  a  more  cost  effective,  long-term  solution  to  meeting  power  demand 
requirements by supporting investment in grid-connected renewable energy.   
The power supply shortage is complicated by a decline in the availability of domestic 
natural gas and biomass resources. It has been estimated that Bangladesh’s natural 
gas reserves will start to deplete in 2020 if no new gas reserves are discovered and 
                                                      
21 PGCB Monthly Operational Reports. 
35 
 
 
new technology does not allow increased extraction of gas from existing fields. The 
uncertainty  about  reserves  has  limited  the  development  of  gas-based  power 
generation.  Biomass  is  becoming  scarcer  and  more  expensive,  which  negatively 
impacts  poor  households  that  rely  on  this  fuel  source.  More  than  90  percent  of 
Bangladesh households use traditional biomass for cooking, and biomass accounts for 
50 percent of Bangladesh’s total energy supply. The common fuels used are rice husks, 
jute sticks, cow dung and wood.22 SREP funds could help increase the role of renewable 
energy in Bangladesh’ generation mix in both grid-connected and off-grid areas and 
reduce dependence on these resources with limited availability.  
Climate change is another significant challenge faced by Bangladesh. Box 2.2 discusses 
why  Bangladesh  is  one  of  the  most  vulnerable  countries  to  the  effects  of  climate 
change. While this is a challenge of vital importance, it is not one that can be overcome 
through SREP support.     
Box 2.2: Climate Change and Bangladesh   
Bangladesh is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change. As a low-
lying country with many rivers, Bangladesh has a very high flood risk, both due to monsoons 
and sea-level rise associated with climate change. Rising temperatures have already begun 
to  shorten  the  life  cycle  for  rice;  reducing  yields.  Low  crop  production  could  increase 
poverty up to 15 percent by 2030. Higher water levels  could lead to higher incidence of 
waterborne disease, such as cholera, and result in forced migration due to flooding.  
The  World  Bank  has  noted  that  Bangladesh  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  an  increase  in 
poverty  headcount  rate  and  risk  of  chronic  poverty  as  a  result  of  different  warming 
scenarios.  Climate  change  could  also  reduce  the  availability  of  clean  water  supply  and 
sanitation.   
The World Risk Report ranks Bangladesh as the fifth most vulnerable country in the world 
to climate change.  In addition, the Climate Change Vulnerability Index rates Dhaka as one 
of  the  five  most  climate-vulnerable  cities  in  the  world.  Bangladesh  addresses  climate 
change issues through the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, which is 
implemented through the donor-funded Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (See 
Table 3.17 for more details).  
 
3 
Bangladesh  has  substantial  technical  potential  for  renewable  energy  generation. 
Resource  assessments  indicate  that  Bangladesh  could  realize  over  6,000  GWh  of 
generation  from  renewable  technologies  annually.  The  Government  has  ambitious 
targets  for  renewable  development,  and  a  robust  and  active  private  sector  has 
substantial  experience  increasing  access  of  off-grid  solutions  to  commercial  and 
residential customers. 
Renewable Energy Sector Context 
                                                      
22 A household energy program has recently been initiated by IDCOL with World Bank support for dissemination of 
one million improved cookstoves by 2018. The program also includes support for biogas digesters for cooking. 
Once this program established the viability of engaging the non-government organizations in demand creation 
and supply-chain development for dissemination of improved cookstoves, the program will be scaled up in Phase 
II (potentially with GCF funding). 
36 
 
 
However,  renewable  energy  remains  a  small  portion  of  Bangladesh’s  generation 
portfolio. Installed RE generation capacity is currently 437 MW (see Figure 3.1), with 
the 230 MW Kaptai HPP  being the only grid-connected RE resource. The remaining 
137  MWs  of  RE  capacity  include  off-grid  installations  and  rooftop  solar  providing 
site-specific  service.  Barriers  preventing  the  scale-up  of  RE  in  Bangladesh  include 
affordability and a lack of available commercial financing; the lack of a comprehensive 
legal and regulatory framework for RE; and a lack of feasibility and technical potential 
data.

3.1  Assessment of Electricity Generating RE Technologies  
An assessment of available data on  the use of RE in Bangladesh was carried out to 
support the preparation of the IP. This section details the results of the assessment 
and  describes  progress  to  date  on  deploying  RE  technologies  in  Bangladesh.  The 
results of the resource assessment are shown in Table 3.1.

The  resource  potential  for  solar  parks  was  a  conservative  estimate  that  excluded 
agricultural  land  and  assumed that  only  two percent  of  the  available land  for  solar 
parks would be suitable for development, in order to take into account potential land 
obstructions. If this assumption were raised to five percent, the resource potential for 
solar parks would be 3,500 MW. This would bring potential RE capacity to 5,766 MW 
in total. 
3.1.1  Solar Parks 
There are currently no complete solar park projects in Bangladesh, but five projects 
with a total installed capacity of 44.9 MW are currently under construction or  have 
financing committed. In addition, the GoB has recently approved a proposal for a 200 
MW solar park on 1,000 acres of non-agricultural land in Teknaf of Cox’s Bazar, to be 
carried  out  by  SunEdison  Energy  Holding  (Singapore)  Private  Ltd.  The  Power 
Development Board will buy electricity from the project at Tk 13.26 per kWh for 20 
years.23 
Data on solar radiation were from a Solar Wind Energy Resource Assessment (SWERA) 
that had been completed by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the 
Global Environment Facility (GEF) in 2007.24 The technical potential of solar parks was 
                                                      
23 The Daily Star, 3 October 2015. 
24 SWERA data consisted of Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data files for eight locations, shown as green dots 
on the resource maps.  
38 
 
 
determined  by  first  evaluating  the  overall  resource  potential,  in  terms  of  solar 
radiation, and then applying exclusions to limit this potential to only areas practical 
for  development.  Solar  park  locations  were  preferred  to  be  within  20  km  of  a 
transmission  line  and  could  not  be  located  on  land  with  a  slope  greater  than  five 
percent,  forest  land,  wetland,  urban  areas,  historical  flood  areas,  military bases,  or 
protected areas.25  
The  GoB  has  stipulated  that  solar  parks  should  only  be  developed  on  government-
owned  non-agricultural  land  or  privately-owned  uncultivable  land.  Two  cases  were 
developed to show the resource potential when agricultural land is excluded (Case 1) 
and when it is included (Case 2). In both cases only two percent of the eligible land 
was assumed to be suitable for development, in order to take into account potential 
land obstructions. Figure 3.2 below shows the resource locations identified; the results 
of the resource assessment are presented in Table 3.2. The two percent assumption 
was used so as to be conservative in estimates of potential but also to ensure that the 
assessment  of  potential  was  roughly  consistent  with  Government  targets  for  solar 
resource development (see Section 2.4).

data were from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) Geospatial Toolkit for Bangladesh. Historical 
flood information for 2000-2014 was from the Bangladesh Water Development Board.

3.1.2  Solar Rooftop 
Solar rooftop systems are grid connected systems that provide onsite power at the 
point of installation and then feed excess power to the grid. Approximately 14 MW in 
solar rooftop PV systems have been installed in Bangladesh but most of this capacity 
produces little energy and is not grid connected. Most of the rooftop PV installations 
on new buildings are the result of a government requirement for a certain percentage 
of lighting loads to come from solar for getting a new grid connection. In the absence 
of a clear regulation and lack of inspection and monitoring, many of these installations 
are reported to be put up merely to satisfy the requirements for getting a  new grid 
connection,  and  are  not  up  to  standards  to  produce  any  meaningful  energy.  The 
remaining capacity is from BPDB installation on several Government buildings, such as 
a 21.6 kWp system on the Prime Minister’s Office, a 32.75 kWp system on the WAPDA 
office  building,  and  a  37.5  kWp  system  on  the  Bidyut  Bhaban  building.  A  50  kWp 
system on the Secretariat building is the only such grid connected rooftop installation.  
The SWERA solar radiation data were again used to assess solar resources. Availability 
of land was assessed using two existing studies on rooftop space available for solar PV 
in  parts  of  Dhaka  and  Chittagong.  Box  3.1  summarizes  the  approach  and  results  of 
these studies.
40 
 
 
Box 3.1: Rooftop Availability Studies   
The following studies on available rooftop space  for solar PV were  used in the technical 
analysis:  
  CEPZ Study (2014). The Chittagong Export Processing Zone (CEPZ) is a 183.37 hectare 
trade zone with 501 industrial plots ranging from 718 to 2,350 m2. Researchers at Go for 
Green and Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology divided CEPZ into six 
zones and used Google Earth line measurement tools to estimate the approximate area 
of roof space in each zone. Roofs were categorized as either south facing, west facing, 
or flat; and roofs covered by obstacles were excluded. Total available rooftop for solar 
PV system in the CEPZ was estimated as 170,810 m2 (0.17 km2).  
  Dhaka City Study (2010). Researchers in the Department of Geography at Humboldt-
University of Berlin estimated the potential sunlit rooftop area within the high building 
density  areas  of  the  Dhaka  City  Corporation  (now  Dhaka  City  North  and  Dhaka  City 
South). The study used Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) on a high-resolution satellite 
image taken in 2006 to estimate rooftop area with bright sunlight. In other words, the 
researchers set color, shape, and scale parameters representative of a bright rooftop 
that OBIA software used to analyze the image and report the total area meeting those 
parameters. The results indicate that there are 10.554 km2 of bright rooftop space in the 
Dhaka  City  North  and  Dhaka  City  South  combined.  There  are  limitations  to  this 
approach-- the study excluded rooftops in informal settlements, but there were no other 
restrictions on the type of building or roof.        
  Dhanmondi  Study  (2014).  Researchers  from  American-International  University-
Bangladesh and the Asian Institute of Technology (Bangkok) refined the results of the 
Dhaka  City  Study  by  manually  measuring  (using  Google  Maps  and  ArcGIS  software) 
bright  rooftops in a 9.83  km2  area around the Dhanmondi neighborhood in southern 
Dhaka City. The researchers considered several factors for excluding rooftops, such as 
construction and design constraints; shade from trees and nearby buildings; obstacles 
on the rooftop; and rooftop orientation. Approximately 50 percent of the bright rooftop 
area found using the Dhaka City Bright Rooftop Study approach was found to actually be 
suitable for solar rooftop systems in the Dhanmondi area.

Chakraborty,  Sanjib  et  al.  “Possibilities  and  potentialities  of  roof  top  solar  PV  system  within 
Chittagong export processing zone (CEPZ), Bangladesh.” Proceedings of 5th International Conference 
on Environmental Aspects of Bangladesh, 2014.   
 
It was assumed that 50 percent of bright rooftop area found in the Dhaka  Rooftop 
Study (5.277 km2) are buildings that would be available for housing a rooftop system, 
combining  the  results  of  the  Dhaka  study  and  the  assumptions  of  the  Dhanmondi 
study.  Because  the  CEPZ  results  include  a  more  comprehensive  analysis  of  the 
structures, the entire estimated area (0.17 km2) is included. A total of 5.447 km2 roof 
space is assumed to be available. The technical potential was calculated by treating 
the estimated areas as one large rooftop  covered with 1,000 W solar modules that 
take  up  approximately  9.29  m2  (100  ft2).  The  technical  potential  also  includes  an 
additional  81  MWs  from  three  national  programs  targeting  (i)  installation  of  solar 
rooftop systems on schools (41 ME), (ii) railroad stations (30 MW), and (iii) commercial 
and  industrial  buildings  (10  MW). 26 In  order  to  calculate  potential  generation,  the 
                                                      
26 It is assumed these targets were based on estimates of actual rooftop availability.  
41 
 
 
capacity factors used for solar parks were modified to take into account the potential 
suboptimal location of a rooftop system compared to a solar park. Table 3.3 shows 
capacity factors for solar rooftop systems and solar home systems.

3.1.3  Solar Home Systems 
Solar  home  systems  (SHS)  are  low  capacity  solar  PV-battery  units  that  provide 
electricity to individual or clustered off-grid customers. SHS installation has already 
been one of the most successful RE initiatives in Bangladesh, with around 3.8 million 
units installed since 2003, with over 35,000 systems installed per month. IDCOL has 
set a target to fund 6 million SHS units by 2017.  
IDCOL’s installation targets are used as a basis for estimating the SHS market. Given 
that  approximately  4  million  IDCOL-funded  installations  that  would  have  been 
completed by the end of 2015, another 2 million more SHS units need to be installed 
to achieve the 2017 target. The installation target was allocated among the 11 SHS 
size options offered by IDCOL, with more units being allocated to the most commonly 
sold sizes. Table 3.4 shows the number of SHS units by size included in the technical 
potential.

3.1.4  Wind Farms 
A 900 kW plant at the Muhuri Dam and a 1000 kW plant on Kutubdia remain the only 
grid-connected wind farms currently in operation.    
42 
 
 
Wind  speed  and  land  availability  were  the  determining  factors  in  assessing  the 
technical  potential.  Wind  resources  were  evaluated  using  AWS  Truepower’s 
WindNavigator data that provide estimates of wind speed, wind speed distribution, 
wind  direction,  and  diurnal  patterns  at  a  height  of  80  m  above  ground  level.  For  a 
location to be considered a viable site it was required to be located preferably within 
20 km of a transmission line. Land not suitable for wind farm installation was excluded 
from the assessment.27  
Flooding is a concern for wind farms because softening of the soil could compromise 
the foundation of the turbines. Two cases were developed by combining the AWS data 
with GIS flood data, showing the resource potential when flood prone land is excluded 
(Case 1) and when it is included (Case 2). The AWS data were also used to evaluate the 
resource  potential  according  to  capacity  factor.  In  both  cases,  fifty  percent  of  the 
eligible  land  was  assumed  to  be  suitable  for  development,  in  order  to  take  into 
account  potential  land  obstructions.  The  results  of  the  resource  assessment  are 
presented in Table 3.5.

3.1.5  Biomass 
Rice byproducts, particularly rice husk and rice straw, are the most readily available 
biomass feedstock for power generation. Because rice straw is more beneficial left in 
the field as fertilizer or for use as a direct cooking fuel, only rice husk is viewed as a 
viable feedstock option. Other options, such as wood biomass, are limited because 37 
of  63  districts  partially  or  completely  protect  local  forests  from  deforestation,  and 
what  resources  are  available  are  used  for  residential  cooking.  There  is  currently  a 
250 kW off-grid rice husk plant in the Kapasia upazlia and a 400 kW rice husk plant 
proposed for Thakurgaon.            
An estimated 10.13 million tons of rice husk are produced annually in Bangladesh.28 It 
is assumed that that only 50 percent of rice husk is available for electricity generation 
and that  only  10  percent  of  the  gross resource potential  is  located  at  a  sufficiently 
large  commercial  rice  operation  to  host  a  digester  for  electricity  production.  The 
energy content of rice husk is assumed to be 16 MJ/kg and that the biomass plant has 
a heat rate of 13,648 btu/kWh. The technical potential results are shown in Table 3.6.

3.1.6  Biogas 
Farms in Bangladesh are installing small-scale biogas plants that use animal waste to 
produce power for own-use purposes. There are currently two IDCOL-funded plants—
400 kW and 50 kW—in operation with four more plants ranging in size from 25 to 100 
kW under construction. Cow manure is also a possible fuel option at large commercial 
operations  where  the  manure  is  less  likely  to  be  needed  for  domestic  cooking

purposes. GIZ has provided technical assistance and some funding to poultry and dairy 
farms that have installed an aggregate of 1,200 kW in small- to medium-sized engine 
biogas fueled generators (5 kW to 50 kW).29   
Resource  potential  was  determined  by  estimating  the  amount  of  animal  waste 
available  for  electricity  generation.  Only  livestock  at  commercial  farms  were 
considered  because  animal  waste  at  subsistence  farms  has  other  uses,  such  as 
cookstove  fuel  and  fertilizer.  Agricultural  statistics  from  the  Bangladesh  Bureau  of 
Statistics  (BBS)  were  used  to  determine  the  number  of  poultry  and  cattle  at 
commercial operations. Yield of waste per animal head was assumed to be 0.01 ton 
per cattle and 0.12 kg per bird.30 Between these two waste-to-energy options, poultry 
is more viable because it is a local product, while cows are imported from India. Figure 
3.4 shows the resource potential by location for poultry and cattle waste.  
Figure 3.4: Commercial Farming Animal Waste Resource Maps

Cattle 
  
 
 
It was assumed that only 10 percent of the resource potential is located at commercial 
operations  large  enough  to  host  a  digester.  The  technical  assessment  from  this 
potential assumes that conversion of waste to biogas is 47 m3/ton of cattle manure 
and 200 m3/ton for chicken waste, and that biogas consists of 50 percent methane. 
The  biogas  plant  is  assumed  to  have  a  reciprocating  engine  efficiency  of  10,000 
kWh/btu and capacity factor of 50 percent. The technical potential results are shown 
in Table 3.7.

3.1.7  Waste-to-Energy (Electricity) 
Waste-to-energy  plants  use  municipal  household  waste  for  power  production. 
Approximately 13,383 tons of solid waste are produced daily in Bangladesh; more than 
4,379  tons  come  from  Dhaka  alone.  As  part  of  a  solid  waste  management  (SWM) 
technical  assistance  project,  JICA  set  target  goals  for  advancing  SWM  in  Dhaka, 
including the development of plans for waste-to-energy.31 In 2012, Dhaka North City 
Corporation and Dhaka South City Corporation announced plans to build two waste-
to-energy  plants:  an  incineration  plant  in  Matuali  and  an  anaerobic  digester  in 
Aminbazar. The plans intended for the plants to be commissioned with a combined 
capacity  to  process  1,000  tons  of  waste  and  produce  10  MW  of  power,  and  then 
increase capacity to process 6,000 tons of waste and 50 MW of power within three 
years.32 Despite a successful bidding process, the construction of the plants has been 
delayed  several  times  and  has  not  yet  started.33 One  reason  construction  has  been 
delayed is the fact that the city governments have had problems developing processes 
for waste collection.  
Despite  vast  resource  potential  (in  terms  of  daily  municipal  waste  production),  the 
actual  technical  potential  cannot  be  estimated  without  established  procedures  for 
delivering  the  waste to a  power  plant.  The  GoB  now  intends  to  start  a 1  MW  pilot 
waste-to-energy project that will be used to establish waste collection practices. The 
technical  potential  is  set  at  the  proposed  pilot  plant  size.  The  capacity  factor  is 
assumed to be 80 percent.

3.1.8  Small Hydropower 
The  only  existing  hydropower  plants  in  Bangladesh  are  the  230  MW  Kaptai 
Hydropower Plant and a 10 kW Micro-hydropower plant in Bamerchara. A 2014 study 
by Stream Tech (a US-based engineering firm) for The Ministry of Power, Energy and 
Mineral Resources identified potential hydropower sites at different locations along 
the  Sangu,  Matamuhuri,  and  Bakkhali  Rivers,  as  well  as  the  Banshkhali  Eco-park 
stream. The technical assessment only includes the sites from this study because other 
studies on potential hydropower sites were either outdated or provided inadequate 
information for a technical assessment. 
The technical assessment consisted of an estimate of the generation potential at each 
site.  Topographic  analysis  was  performed  using  GIS-based  Digital  Elevation  Model 
(DEM) data to determine the available gross hydraulic head at each site. A hydrologic 
model was developed to simulate the river flows at the selected sites over a 15-year 
period based on observed stream flow data (2003-2012) from the Bangladesh Water 
Development Board (BWDB).    
Hydropower has limited potential in Bangladesh due to concerns about land use and 
flooding. The construction of the Kaptai dam in 1961 displaced about 100,000 people 
from the Chittagong Hills Tracts due to flooding caused by the dam’s reservoir.34 
3.1.9  Microgrids/Minigrids 
Microgrids are autonomous grids used to deliver power to customers in remote areas. 
Microgrid activity in Bangladesh involves the use of solar minigrids between 100-500 
kWp. The first minigrid in Bangladesh was commissioned on Sandwip Island in 2010. 
Since then, three other minigrids have been installed in Kutubdia (100 kWp); Rajshahi 
(141 kWp); and Narsingdhi (141 kWp). Another 12 projects ranging from 100 to 228 
kWp  have  been  approved  for  IDCOL  financing  and  are  at  various  stages  of 
development.  
IDCOL currently has a list of 20 minigrid projects for which private companies have 
submitted  initial  requests  for  funding.  The  assessment  assumes  these  20  projects 
encompass the current minigrid technical potential.  
3.1.10  Solar Pumps 
Solar  pumps  use  solar  energy  to  pump  water.  The  systems  are  primarily  used  for 
irrigation  purposes  but  can  also  provide  pumping  for  domestic  water  or  fish  pond 
aeration when the pumps are not in use for irrigation. There are approximately 1.34 
million  diesel  irrigation  pumps  in  operation  in  Bangladesh.  Because  each  solar 
irrigation pump could replace three to four diesel pumps, there is potential to replace 
these  pumps  with  335,000  to  450,000  solar  pumps.  Currently  only  large  11  kWp 
systems  installed  on  three-  to  four-crop  per  year  land  are  assumed  to  be  viable 
projects. IDCOL has plans to install 50,000 of these 11 kWp systems by 2025. As of 
June 2015, 156 pumps have been installed and an additional 149 pumps have been 
approved for installation. The resource potential included in the IP is set based on the

comprehensive-response-required-to-complex-displacement-crisis 
47 
 
 
remaining pump installations needed to reach IDCOL’s 2025 goal. Power generation 
potential was estimated using the same capacity factors used for solar parks.  
3.1.11  Geothermal 
There are several locations in Bangladesh with potential geothermal resources but due 
to a lack of additional technical information on these sites no technical potential can 
be confirmed. A study of Bottom Hole Temperature (BHT) of 13 deep wells drilled for 
petroleum  exploration  in  northeastern  part  of  Bangladesh  measured  temperature 
gradient in each well at depths of 3000 to 15,000 m.35 The results show that 11 of these 
locations have temperature gradients of at least 30°C per km. Extensive investments 
in studies and well drilling are necessary to confirm the resource adequacy of these 
sites. 
3.1.12  Hydrokinetic Generation 
Hydrokinetic generating units are turbines installed in river beds. Technology is being 
developed for the purpose of harnessing river flows without reservoir impoundments. 
When  determining  the  technical  potential  the  effects  of  river  morphology  must  be 
considered, as well as impacts on river navigation. Hydrokinetic generation could be 
considered for Brahmaputra and Meghna river basins. In these areas more than 100 
MW of installed capacity could potentially be possible with lower impact compared to 
conventional hydro. 
However, this technology is still emerging, with only a few MWs of capacity deployed 
worldwide. Hydrokinetic generation has proved to be commercially viable in Germany, 
Austria and Italy, but there is a lack of information on costs and technical viability to 
sufficiently  evaluate  it for the  Bangladesh  context.  Hydrokinetic  generation may be 
well suited for future application in Bangladesh if viability is proven over the next ten 
years. 
3.1.13  Tidal Power 
Tidal power is another emerging renewable energy technology. Dams or barrages with 
water turbines can be built across river mouths or inlets to generate electricity from 
the movement of tides. The benefit of tidal power is that power production is more 
predictable  and  consistent  than  either  wind  or  solar.  The  amount  of  electricity 
generated  depends  on  the  range  of  the  tide.  Bangladesh  has  a  tidal  range  of 
2-8 meters, which may be too low for tidal power to be a viable option. In addition to 
the low resource potential, limited international experience—only seven tidal power 
stations  are  in  operation—make  this  technology  impractical  for  Bangladesh  at  this 
time.      
3.2  Assessment of Other RE Technologies  
As  discussed  in  Section  2.3,  biomass  is  the  main  source  of  energy  for  domestic 
consumers  and  cooking  is  the  primary  use  of  fuel.  RE  technologies  are  being 
introduced  in  Bangladesh  that  allow  for  more  efficient  use  of  biomass  or  aim  to 
provide an alternative to biomass-based cooking. The follow sub-sections describe the 
potential for these technologies.

3.2.1  Solar Water Heating  
Solar water heating systems (SWHS) have potential commercial and industrial uses in 
Bangladesh. For example, the tanning industry has been identified as an industry with 
great potential for solar water heating. UNIDO has already installed three pilot SWHS 
systems  on  tanneries.  If  SWHS  were  installed  to  meet  the  120  million  liters  of  hot 
water required by the 200 tanneries in Bangladesh each year, more than 2.67 m3 of 
natural gas could be replaced annually. Textile factories are also considered locations 
where SWHS can be used to heat water for dying purposes. A GIZ study estimates that 
there  is  the  potential  for  some  10,000  SWHS to  be  installed for  providing  5  million 
liters of hot water daily to textile factories.  
3.2.2 
Improved Cookstoves (ICS) 
Traditional  cookstoves  used  in  Bangladesh  are  inefficient  and  release  smoke  into 
homes. Newer biomass-based cookstoves have been developed that use fuel up to 50 
percent more efficiently and emit less smoke. ICS projects have been some of the most 
successful energy  initiatives  in  Bangladesh,  with more than 1.5  million  ICS  installed 
since  1989.36 More  recently,  IDCOL  has  embarked  upon  an  ICS program  with  World 
Bank  support  to  disseminate  one  million  ICS  by  2018  based  on  the  public-private 
partnership approach of the successful SHS program.  
The GoB’s Country Action Plan for Clean Cookstoves (November 2013) set a target to 
reach  100  percent  market  penetration  by  2030,  a  goal  that  will  require  the 
dissemination of 30 million ICS. As many as 67 percent of households use more than 
one stove; if these are taken into account, there could be demand for an additional 20 
million.37    
3.2.3  Biogas for Domestic Cooking 
Another alternative to traditional cookstoves is to deliver biogas to residential homes 
for  cooking  purposes.  Domestic  biogas  plants  are  small-capacity  (2.4  to  4.8  m3) 
anaerobic digesters designed for individual household use.38 There have also been a 
few medium-capacity systems installed to serve clusters of homes. Digesters are fed 
mostly with cattle and poultry waste, though kitchen and household waste and human 
excreta are also used. More than 33,000 domestic biogas plants have been installed 
using IDCOL funding, with Grameen Shakti implementing the majority of the projects 
as a partner organization. Due to the interchangeability between ICS and biogas plants 
it  is  difficult  to  determine  the  demand  for  domestic  biogas  plants.  A  2005  study 
produced by SNV Netherlands and IDCOL suggests the market potential could be as

high as 950,000 domestic biogas plants.39  IDCOL has set a target to install just 100,000 
domestic  biogas  plants  by  2018.  As  a  conservative  assumption,  the  current  IDCOL 
target is used as the assumed market potential.  
3.2.4  Waste-to-Energy (Natural Gas) 
In  addition  to  generating  power,  municipal  waste  can  also  be  used  as  a  source  of 
natural  gas.  Producing  gas  from  municipal  waste  faces  the  same  waste  collection 
issues faced by waste-to-power projects; therefore, more studies would be needed to 
estimate  technical  potential  for  producing  gas  from  waste.  The  GoB,  however,  has 
proposed  the  Clean  City  Clean  Fuel  project  as  a  pilot  project  to  demonstrate  the 
potential  of  municipal  waste  for  gas  production.  The  Clean  City  Clean  Fuel  project 
plans to install anaerobic digesters in 20 municipalities that each generate around 20-
100  tons  of  solid  waste  per  day.  Natural  gas  would  either  be  piped  to  residential 
houses or picked up by customers at fill stations. Assuming a yield of 367 m3 per ton 
of  waste 40 ,  this  project  could  produce  146.8  to  731  TCM  of  natural  gas  daily.  In 
addition,  the  byproduct  from  the  anaerobic  digester  could  eventually  be  sold  as 
fertilizer following a three-year composting period. 
3.3  Cost of RE Technologies  
The comparative cost of renewable energy technologies is an important factor when 
determining their viability and attractiveness for inclusion in Bangladesh’s electricity 
development  plan. 41 This  section  includes  supply  curves  which  show  the  levelized 
energy  costs  (LECs)  of  the  various  grid-connected  and  off-grid  renewable  energy 
technologies assessed in Bangladesh for the preparation of the Investment Plan, as 
well as the estimated production of each of those technologies.  
The LECs of the various grid-connected renewable energy technologies were assessed 
on an economic and financial basis. The purpose of economic analysis is to understand 
which  supply  options  are  the  best  option  for  Bangladesh,  irrespective  of  the  actual 
cost of financing that would be used for the projects. A social discount rate is used for 
economic  analysis,  where  the  rate  (10  percent)  reflects  an  estimate  of  the  social 
opportunity cost of capital for the country. Concessional financing terms are used to 
evaluate financial viability in order to demonstrate the potential for each technology 
to  attract  private  investment.  The  assumptions  used  for  the  viability  analysis  are 
shown in Table 3.8.

41 The cost of renewable energy was not, however, the only criterion used for selecting project to be included in 
the Investment Plan. It is only one of a number of factors that was considered in the course of developing this 
investment  plan.  Section  4  describes  the  other  criteria  used  to  select  the  projects  for  which  SREP  funding  is 
requested.

representing  the range  in  LEC  of  a new coal plant43.  The price  of diesel  is  meant  to 
demonstrate the competiveness of RE options with RPPs, the short run power supply 
option. The price of coal generation represents a likely long run power supply option 
given the projected depletion of domestic natural gas reserves.

3.3.3  Cost of Other RE Technologies  
This section presents a summary of the costs of the other RE technologies considered 
in the IP. Due to the limited details on the specifics of the Clean City Clean Fuel project 
costs could not be estimated for the provision of gas services from municipal waste.   
ICS 
The most common biomass based ICS is the chulha model. The cost of a chulha stove 
ranges depending on region and material. Concrete models ($10-23) can be built in 
1-2 hours and last approximately three years. Clay models ($10-19) are built in 5 to 7 
days and last more than five years.46 The payback period for ICS is 2-3 months due to 
around 50 percent savings in fuel compared to traditional stoves.  
Biogas for Domestic Cooking 
A biogas cooking system includes both an aerobic digester and a biogas cookstove. 
The system costs range from US$ 330-$615.47 
Solar Water Heating 
A SWHS systems consists of a solar water heating panel and an adjoining water tank. 
The cost of a 1,000 liter SWHS is approximately US$ 8,974.  
3.4  Barriers to RE 
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 provided estimates of the technical potential for RE technologies 
in  Bangladesh,  and  Section  3.3  showed  that  many  of  these  technologies  are 
economically and financially viable. Despite this significant potential  the market for 
many  of  these  technologies  has  been  slow  to  develop.  There  are  a  number  of 
regulatory,  financial  and  technical  barriers  that,  when  addressed  will  accelerate 
renewable energy investment in Bangladesh. New regulations, such as establishment 
of  a  formal  feed-in  tariff  and  provisions  for  compensating  minigrid  investors  after 
transmission expansion, will reduce risk and send strong signals to investors. Grant 
funding and low-interest financing  will help to address concerns about affordability 
for both grid-connected and off-grid projects. Reduced financing costs can also offset 
the high cost of procuring land for projects, land scarcity being one of the key barriers 
to investment. Successful renewable energy pilot projects will provide better access 
to data on renewable energy; and demonstrate successful business models that can 
be  replicated  by  local  banks;  and  allow  local  workers  the  opportunity  to  learn  the 
necessary technical skills.   
Table 3.11 describes some of the most significant barriers hindering the development 
of renewable energy in Bangladesh. The investment program described in Section 5 
includes measures to address many of the most substantial barriers. Moreover, the 
ongoing  IDA  technical  assistance  program  (under  the  Rural  Electrification  and 
Renewable Energy Development II, RERED II project) will support the development of 
legal and regulatory frameworks for grid-connected RE.  Implemented by the Power 
Cell  of  the  Ministry  of  Power,  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources,  the  TA  is  flexible  to

3.5  Role of Private Sector 
The private sector in Bangladesh has been very active in the renewable energy sector 
and  has  helped  increase  access  of  off-grid  solutions  to  commercial  and  residential 
customers through financing mechanisms such as microloans, low interest loans, retail 
sales,  and  some  generation  investment.  The  GoB  has  played  a  substantial  role  in 
incentivizing private sector participation by creating a commercially viable market for 
the uptake of RE technology, using guaranteed refinancing schemes delivered through 
IDCOL and the Bangladesh Bank.48 The most common types of private sector players 
include:  private  commercial  banks,  foreign  commercial  banks,  non-governmental 
organizations (NGO), and retailers.49  
Commercial banks 
The  Bangladesh  Bank  Refinancing  Scheme  for  Renewable  Energy  is  a  revolving 
refinancing mechanism that provides loans for RE and energy efficiency projects such 
as biogas, solar, bio-fertilizer plants, SHS, solar irrigation pumps, and hybrid Hoffman 
kilns  at  low  interest  rates.50 Domestic  and foreign  commercial  banks  have  been the 
leading participants. In 2014, Domestic commercial banks on-lent US$ 287.57 million 
to  finance  RE  projects,  90  percent  of  the  total  amount  disbursed  by  the  revolving 
scheme. Foreign commercial banks on-lent US$ 8.05 million to finance RE projects, 3 
percent of the total amount disbursed by the revolving. Table 3.12 shows the types of 
RE projects which received financing at reduced rates in 2014 under the Refinancing 
Scheme for Renewable Energy.

Non-governmental organizations 
Non-governmental organizations play an important role in expanding the uptake of RE 
technology in Bangladesh. As partner organizations (PO) of IDCOL’s SHS, and domestic 
                                                      
48 The GoB established the Infrastructure Development Company (IDCOL) in 1997 as an implementing agency which 
on-lends grants and loans to partner organizations who in turn procure, install, and often times refinance loans 
to households.

this scheme. http://www.sreda.gov.bd/index.php/investment/financing-schemes

biogas  programs,  NGOs  serve  as  important  intermediaries  between  IDCOL  and 
customers by directly procuring RE technology components from suppliers, installing 
SHS, and on-lending micro loans to customers (see Figure 3.9). Since 2003 when the 
SHS program started, 3.8 million SHS systems have been installed and currently serve 
about 14 percent of the Bangladeshi population. The domestic biogas program which 
was initiated in 2006 has since financed more than 33,000 biogas plants in Bangladesh.

Box 3.2: Financing of IDCOL Projects 
Solar Home System (SHS) 
The Solar Home System (SHS) program was started by IDCOL in 2003, with credit and grant 
support from the World Bank and GEF. The program was later expanded with additional 
financing from GIZ, KfW, ABD, IDB, GPOBA, JICA, USAID and DFID. IDCOL offers refinancing, 
grant support, and technical assistance to 47 Partner Organizations (POs) who implement 
the program.51 The major POs include Grameen Shakti, Rural Services Foundation, Srizony 
Bangladesh, and BRAC Foundation. POs purchase the system components from suppliers 
(who receive  approval from the Technical Standards Committee) and install the  systems 
and provide service to households.52  
Households pay the POs 10-15 percent of the SHS price at installation, and pay the rest of 
the cost over a 3-year micro-credit period at a flat interest rate of 12 to 15 percent. When 
the  life  of  a  battery  is  over,  households  have  a  buy-back  and  replacement  option. 
Households are also offered a discounted price if they accept a shorter repayment period 
and also have the option to buy the SHS outright in cash.53  
After making an installation, POs apply for refinancing of the micro-credit and a capital buy-
down grant from IDCOL. The refinancing from IDCOL covers 80 percent of the micro-credit 
extended to households, and has a 6 percent flat interest rate for a period of 6-8 years. The 
capital buy-down allows POs to reduce the costs of SHS to households. The grant, which 
was initially set at US$ 90 per SHS, is now US$ 20 per SHS of less than 30 Wp size. A US$ 3 
per SHS institutional development grant is also provided to new POs to assist with up-front 
costs of setting up their establishments.54  
Solar Irrigation Program 
IDCOL runs the Solar Irrigation Program with financing from The World Bank, KfW, GPOBA, 
JICA, USAID, ADB and Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF).55 This program 
has  two  business  models:    the  fee  for  service  model,  which  is  currently  in  use,  and  the 
proposed ownership model, which IDCOL is trying to introduce.56  
In the fee for service model, pump operators (private sector sponsors) put in 20 percent of 
the project  cost  as equity and IDCOL provides 40 percent of the cost as a grant  and the 
remaining 40 percent as credit at a 6 percent interest rate, to be repaid over a period of 8 
years.  The  grant  and  credit  funds  are  sourced  from  development  partners.  There  are 
currently  17  sponsor  organizations  which  have  implemented  projects  under  this  model. 
These sponsors purchase TSC-approved equipment (pumps and PV panels) from suppliers, 
who install the equipment and provide after-sale service. The sponsors own the pumps and 
sell  water  to  farmers  who  pay  an  irrigation  charge.  Payments  are  collected  by  pump 
operators.57

The ownership model functions in a similar way for donors, IDCOL, and suppliers, but has 
POs (instead of sponsors) who sell the pump on cash/credit to farmers. Under this model 
farmers will pay 60 percent of what the pump would cost without a grant. They make a 20 
percent down-payment and pay the rest in yearly installments for 5 years, at a 15 percent 
interest rate.58  
Solar Minigrid Projects 
IDCOL runs the solar minigrid projects with financing from The World Bank, KfW, GPOBA, 
JICA,  USAID,  ADB  and  DFID. 59  The  projects  are  implemented  through  sponsors,  who 
contribute 20% of projects costs from their own sources and receive 50% grant financing 
and 30% concessionary financing from IDCOL. The concessionary loans have a 6 percent 
interest rate and are paid in quarterly installments over a maximum of 10 years, with a 2 
year  grace  period.60 The  grants  and  concessionary  loans  are  sourced  from  development 
partners.  Sponsors 
institutions  and  private  sector 
companies. 61  Sponsors  hire  O&M  contractors,  which  provide  O&M  solutions,  and  EPC 
contractors, which purchase equipment from suppliers and provide turnkey solutions. The 
sponsors  provide  grid  connections  to  customers  (including  small  shops,  health  centers, 
schools,  etc.),  who  pay  tariffs  to  the  sponsors. 62  Tariffs  are  US$  0.38  per  kWh,  and 
customers must also pay a one-time connection cost of US$ 38-64 and monthly line rent of 
US$  1-2. 63  After  the  project  implementation,  minigrids  are  monitored  by  IDCOL's 
monitoring team and environmental consultant. Suppliers also provide after-sale service.64

Private investments in RE generation 
There has been growing private sector activity in off-grid RE technologies for electricity 
generation. Much of this investment is for own use purposes, at dairy farms or poultry 
farms where dung or litter is fed into a biogas digester. The bio gas which is produced 
is  used  as  cooking  fuel  or  for  power  generation.  Table  3.16  lists  proposed  and 
completed biogas projects funded by IDCOL from 2010 – 2015.

More recently, Purobi Green Energy Limited (PGEL) and Prokaushali Sangsad Limited 
(PSL) invested and installed the country’s first solar minigrid on Sandwip Island. Purobi 
Green Energy Limited funded 20 percent of the total project costs, while the remaining 
amount was financed through a grant and loan from IDCOL. The minigrid is the first 
utility of its kind in Bangladesh and has a capacity of 100kW, and a 40kW back up diesel 
generator.  
There  is  also  some  private  sector  participation  in  the  RE  generation  investment. 
Parasol  Energy,  a  subsidiary  of  the  poultry  conglomerate  Paragon  Group,  has 
proposed to build a solar park on one of its poultry farms.

   Grid-Connected  Solar  PV.  The  GoB  is  currently  implementing  a  number  of  grid-connected  Solar  PV  Projects, 
including a 7.4 MW solar PV plant at the Kaptai Hydro Power Station in Rangamati and a 4.2 MW (2.2 MW solar +2 
MW diesel) solar-diesel based hybrid power plant in Hatiya. These projects are being constructed on a turnkey 
basis, with assistance from ADB. 
ADB 
  Sustainable  Energy  for  Development  (SED)  Program.  This  program  works  to  promote  the  efficient  use  of 
Gesellschaft für 
Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit  (GIZ) 
renewable energy in Bangladesh through clean cookstoves, biogas digesters, and solar power. 
–  Clean  Cookstoves.  GIZ  has  installed  more  than  400,000  new  domestic  cookstoves  and  3,000  commercial 
cookstoves. 
–  Biogas. GIZ has supported the installation of about 1,500 biogas plants in slaughterhouses, and on dairy and 
poultry farms. These now produce biogas on a commercial scale, which is used for cooking and generating 
electricity. By December 2013, about 5 GW of power was being generated with biogas digesters. SED is also 
working with a tea garden in the Tetulia area of Panchagar District to explore the possibility of using biogas 
powered heaters to dry harvested tea leaves. This would replace/save the diesel fuel the garden presently 
uses for this purpose. 
–   Solar Photovoltaic Pumping (PVP) Systems. In 2010, GIZ started installing Solar Photovoltaic Pumping (PVP) 
Systems  for  drinking  water  supply.  The  program  has  installed  over  100  systems  since  2010,  with  a  total 
installed capacity of 92.32 kW and a total pumping capacity of 2,209,000 L/day. 
Additional support for SED is provided by the Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources. 
  IDCOL Solar Home System Program. The program began in 2003 and works in line with the GoB’s vision of ensuring 
“Access to Electricity for All” by 2021. IDCOL has installed 3.8 million SHS benefiting about 20 million people who 
are getting solar electricity as a result of the installations in off-grid rural areas. About 35,000 SHS are noe being 
installed every month under the IDCOL program. The program replaces 228,000 tons of kerosene (traditionally

used for lighting) haven an estimated value of US$ 285 million per year. Funding for this program is also provided 
by GEF, GIZ, KfW, ADB, IDB, GPOBA, JICA, USAID and DFID. 
  IDCOL Solar Irrigation Program. IDCOL has a target to finance 1,550 solar irrigation pumps by 2017. So far, 156 
pumps have been installed and another 149 have been approved for financing. Funding is also provided by KfW, 
GPOBA, JICA, USAID, ADB and Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF). The BCCRF was established in 
2010 for the implementation of the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (2009), which calls for 
the  development  of  renewable  energy,  improvement  to  energy  efficiency,  and  improvements  in  the  energy 
consumption  patterns  of  the  transport  sector.  The  fund  is  managed  and  implemented  by  GoB,  with  ongoing 
temporary assistance from the World Bank.  Energy projects supported by the fund include the Solar Irrigation 
Program  implemented  by IDCOL.  The  fund  is  financed  through development partners,  including  Denmark,  the 
European Union, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, AusAID and USAID. 
  IDCOL Biomass Based Power Project. IDCOL has created a rice husk-based power plant (250 kW at Gazipur), built 
by Dreams Power Private Limited (DPPL). The plant is connected to a minigrid with the capability of delivering 
power to 200 households and 100 small commercial businesses. However, the plant’s current operating capacity 
is limited to 56 kW allowing it to serve only 50 houses.  
  IDCOL Solar Mini Grid Projects. IDCOL has a target to finance 50 microgrids around the country by 2017. In 2010, 
IDCOL  financed  a  100  kW  solar  microgrid  project  on  Sandwip  Island.  The  pilot  minigrid  project  is  currently 
supplying electricity to a 250 neighboring shops, 5 health centers and 5 schools. Funding for these projects is also 
provided by KfW, GPOBA, JICA, USAID, ADB and DFID. 
  IDCOL Biogas-Based Power Projects. Seven poultry waste-based power plants at different sites with capacity over 
1 MW, have been established under IDCOL initiatives. IDCOL plans to finance 450 biogas projects with an average 
of 50kW. Funding is also provided through KfW, USAID, and JICA.

Projects 
  Market Analysis and Development for Improved Cookstoves (ICS). USAID's Catalyzing Clean Energy in Bangladesh 
(CCEB) funds the project, which began in 2013, and aims to develop a framework to facilitate the installation of 
350,000 improved cookstoves by 2017. 
USAID 
  Enhancing Capacity for Low Emission Development Strategies (EC-LEDS). Wind resources assessment is currently 
occurring at 5 sites and assessments of another 4 sites will be starting very soon. Funding for this wind mapping 
is also provided by NREL. 
  Bangladesh Cookstoves Market Assessment. This market assessment on clean cookstoves estimates that only 2 
percent of households in Bangladesh have a clean cookstove, leaving a potential market of more than 29.4 million 
households. 
  Sustainable  Rural  Energy  (SRE)  Project.  The  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  successfully 
completed the first micro-hydro power unit at Bamerchara, Chittagong. Its installed capacity was 10 kW but due 
to inadequate water head falling, only about 4 kW of power was generated.  
UNDP  
  Investment Prospectus. SE4ALL is coordinating with the GoB, IDCOL, and donors to provide a pipeline for energy 
projects  and  match  investors  to  investment  opportunities  in  the  sector.  Current  projects  under  consideration 
include two clean cooking projects, third generation SHS upgrades, and three minigrid projects ranging from 3kW 
to 100kW, a waste-to-energy project, an LED manufacturing facility, and brick kiln technology upgrades.

Many  of  the  technologies  described  in  Sections  3.1  and  3.2  are  important  for 
Bangladesh, but some are better candidates for SREP support than others. This section 
prioritizes  projects  based  on  criteria  identified  by  stakeholders  in  preparatory 
workshops and one-on-one consultations. 
Prioritization of Renewable Energy Technologies  
Hydrokinetic power and tidal power are not considered because the technologies are 
only  on  the  cusp  of  commercial  viability,  and  because  the  potential  resources  in 
Bangladesh  have  not  yet  been  studied  in  much  detail.  Geothermal  power  is  not 
considered because substantial additional work will be needed to verify whether the 
resource  is  worth  investigating  further.  These  resources  and  technologies  may  at 
some point make important contributions to Bangladesh’s energy mix, but they were 
not considered as viable candidates for SREP support. 
Criteria for prioritization 
The  criteria  reflect  a  consideration  of  criteria  important  to  SREP  as  well  as  criteria 
considered  by  stakeholder  to  be  specifically  important  for  Bangladesh.  The  criteria 
are: 
  Scalability. The amount of developable resource potential relative to the other 
technologies,  as  measured  by  production  potential  (GWh).  Resources  with 
higher  production  potential  were  given  higher  priority.  Scalability  is  an 
important component of the transformation impact SREP seeks to achieve with 
its funding, as well as to one of SREP’s expected program outcomes, increased 
supply of renewable energy. 
  Availability  of  sites.  As  described  in  Section  3.4  availability  of  land  is  an 
important barrier to the development of renewable energy in Bangladesh. 
Land has high value for agricultural use, an important driver of Bangladesh’s 
economy. Land suitable for the development of utility-scale plants is scarce, 
also  because  of  seasonal  variations  in  water  levels  and  the  longer-term 
effects of climate change. 
  Unexploited market potential. The extent to which the technology is used 
or  the  resource 
in  Bangladesh.  Resources  or 
technologies which already have financing available through IFI programs 
or  through  the  private  sector  were  given  lower  priority.  Resources  or 
technologies which are lesser known, with little or no support, were given 
higher priority. 
is  already  exploited 
  Readiness for implementation. Technologies were ranked higher if there 
was  reasonably  good  data  on  resource  availability  and  potential  sites  or 
projects. Options without good resource data were ranked lower. 
  Financial  viability.  Technologies  were  ranked  higher 
if  they  were 
determined in Section 3.3 to be close to being cost-competitive with diesel 
generation and therefore less dependent on subsidies. Technologies were 
ranked  lower  if  it  was  determined  that  they  would  need  substantial 
subsidies. 
69 
 
 
Table 4.1 shows the rankings assigned to each technology under each criterion, and 
provides a brief explanations for why each technology received a particular ranking on 
each criterion. A distinction is made between grid-connected and off-grid projects. 
The ranking criteria were used as rough guides and not absolute decision criteria. In 
the  final  evaluation,  other  factors  (such  as  co-benefits)  were  also  considered  by 
Government in developing the list of priority projects. 
It is important to note that projects not put forward for SREP funding will be considered 
for a  second  phase  (Phase  II)  investment  plan,  with  funding  to  be  sought  at  a  later 
stage from the Green Climate Fund (GCF), MDBs, and other sources. Section 5 describes 
the investments to be included in both the Phase I investment plan (with SREP support), 
and Phase II investment plan (where additional support will be sought). 
Summary of Rankings 
The on-grid projects ranked with highest priority were utility-scale solar, and rooftop 
solar. The principal reasons are: 
  There is abundant solar potential in Bangladesh, and an abundance of sites, 
despite the limited availability of non-agricultural land. 
  Few projects have yet broken ground, despite the potential. Some type of 
support  is  clearly  needed  to  show  that  such  projects  can  be  done 
successfully on a larger scale. 
  Few specific sites have yet been identified, but solar data in Bangladesh are 
of relatively good quality and reliability. 
  Utility-scale  and  rooftop  solar  are  now  close  to  parity,  on  an  LCOE  basis, 
with  the  cost  of  diesel  generation  from  the  PPAs  emergency  diesel 
generators in Bangladesh. 
Utility-scale wind projects ranked nearly as well. Their viability as potential projects 
will depend critically on the wind mapping exercise currently being undertaken by 
the Government of Bangladesh and USAID. If there proves to be a good number of 
sites with good resource profiles, such projects could also be considered for SREP 
support under the umbrella of utility-scale renewable energy projects. 
Waste-to-energy did not rank as high as utility-scale renewable energy, but was 
included because of the substantial co-benefits it could have for Bangladesh’s highly 
populated urban areas in terms of waste collection and management, and as a 
further consequence, public health. 
Grid-connected hydropower was not considered for SREP funding, because of the 
lack of reliable data on sites and because of the social and environmental problems 
Bangladesh has had in the past with hydropower projects. Hydropower projects will, 
however, be studied further for possible inclusion in a Phase 2 investment plan. 
The off-grid projects ranked with highest priority were solar irrigation and minigrids. 
These projects were selected because: 
  The resource potential and number of sites is high. 
  Data  on  the  resource  potential  are  good  and  IDCOL  have  identified  a 
number of potential projects in need of funding. 
70 
 
 
  The technologies are competitive with the cost of off-grid diesel generation, 
especially in rural areas where the price of diesel is likely to be higher than 
in urban areas.  
Solar  home  systems  were  not  prioritized  because  there  is  a  concerted  effort  to 
transition  the  program  to  commercial  financing,  which  seems  close  to  being  viable 
with the economies of scale that have been achieved in Bangladesh. Moreover, there 
is adequate funding available at the moment for this program until full commercial 
financing is available. The use of solar irrigation and minigrids, in contrast, are not yet 
as widespread, and still require considerable concessional financing or grant funding 
to be financially viable. 
Solar  cook  stoves,  biomass  and  biogas  projects  were  reserved  for  Phase  II  of 
Bangladesh’s  investment  plan.  The  improved  cookstove  program  of  IDCOL  has 
adequate financing at the moment with a target to achieve one million ICS by 2018. 
Biomass  and  biogas  projects  were  viewed  as  having  sufficient  support,  given  the 
current understanding—still incomplete—of their potential. Such projects would be 
considered (as described in Section 5) for the Phase II investment plan.

The prioritization exercise described in Section 4 has led to the selection of three areas 
where Government will request SREP support: 
Program Description 
  Grid-connected renewable energy, which includes utility-scale solar PV and 
grid-connected rooftop solar PV. If wind resources prove to be sufficient, 
and there is private sector interest, the SREP funds could also be used for a 
grid-connected wind project 
  Off-grid solar PV, which includes solar irrigation, and mini/microgrids 
  Advisory support in preparing a municipal waste-to-energy project. 
This section describes the projects proposed for SREP support, the delivery models that 
may be used for each project, the priority activities envisioned for each project, and the 
expected  co-benefits  and  environmental  and  social  risks  associated  with  the  proposed 
projects. 
5.1  Grid-Connected Renewable Energy 
SREP  contributions  would  be  used  to  leverage  financing  for  the  development  of 
200 MW of utility-scale solar or grid-connected rooftop solar in major urban areas.67 
The rapid decline in solar PV and battery costs in recent years has made utility-scale 
solar  PV  more  affordable  and  more  competitive  with  the  other  power  generation 
options available to Bangladesh, but few projects have gone forward. SREP support 
would help catalyze private investment in a first round of ground- or roof-mounted 
solar PV plants, and show the potential for deploying solar PV on a commercial basis.  
5.1.1  Utility-scale solar PV 
SREP contributions would be used to finance Bangladesh’s first utility-scale solar plant, 
through a public private partnership (PPP) modality. The project would benefit from a 
mix of concessional finance from SREP and the MDBs, as well as commercial finance 
from IFC and other private sector investors. The plant could be tendered through a 
reverse auction, under which Government issues a tender for a given capacity (some 
number of MW) of new grid-connected solar. The tender may be site-specific or not. 
A  site-specific  tender  would  identify  a  specific  site,  on  publicly-owned  land,  for 
construction  of  the  new  plant  or  plants.  As  an  alternative  to  a  site-specific  tender, 
Government  could  tender  a  request  for  a  given  capacity  of  solar,  leaving  it  to  the 
developers the responsibility of acquiring the land. This model would allow for bidding 
by private sector developers who have their own land at the time of bidding, as well 
as  other  developers  who  do  not  yet  have  land  at  the  time  of  bidding.  There  is 
considerable flexibility on how responsibilities can be allocated under a PPP contract, 
but contracts giving the design, build, operate, and finance (DBOF) functions to the 
private sector are most common in such tenders. These contracts are typically known 
as  Build-Own-Transfer  (BOT)  or  Build-Own-Operate  (BOO)  transactions.  Another 
                                                      
67 According to the respective SREP guideline, it is anticipated that roughly $33.75m of the support provided by 
SREP will be in the form of grant, and $41.25m will be in the form of concessional loans. The Grid-Connected 
Renewable Energy projects will be supported by a mix of SREP grant and concessional loan, while the Off-grid 
solar PV projects will be supported by SREP grant. 
77 
 
 
alternative is to allow developers, outside of the tender process, to submit proposals 
for private land. 
Priority activities for utility-scale solar 
The utility-scale solar PV project would include the following activities: 
  Resource  assessment.  If  a  site-specific  tender  is  used,  or  the  plant  is  to  be 
publicly  owned  and  operated,  SREP  grant  funds  could  be  used  to  fund  more 
detailed resource assessments, and identification of possible sites and possible 
projects. Existing data are generally acceptable for understanding the nature of 
the  resource  and  conducting  a  high-level  financial  analysis.  However,  more 
detailed resource assessment will be needed to characterize the solar resource 
potential in the areas targeted for solar development in more detail. Combined 
with other ongoing resource assessment, this component would enable national 
resource mapping, which will facilitate further potential investment in solar PV. 
  Investment in project or projects. SREP support would be used to offer blended 
finance  to private  bidders.  For  example,  roughly  US$43  million  of  SREP  funds 
could be used to leverage US$ 100 million in IDA financing from the World Bank, 
US$100 million in a partial risk guarantee (PRG) or similar instrument if needed, 
and US$220 million in investment from IFC and other private sector investors for 
utility-scale renewable energy plants (primarily solar but possibly also wind), and 
rooftop solar. A benefit of using IFC financing is that no sovereign guarantees 
are required.  
  Advisory assistance. IFC could assist through transaction advisory or technical 
assistance in identifying project or business models. Transaction advisors could 
be hired to help government tender for the projects identified in the feasibility 
studies; this could include assistance in developing the framework for reverse 
auctions.  As  described  above,  private  operators  would  be  procured  through 
competitive tender. Bidders would be selected based on technical and financial 
criteria, the financial criteria being the level of tariff required or, alternatively, 
the level of concessional support required. Developers offering lower tariffs or 
requiring  less  concessional  support  would  receive  higher  scores.  In  addition, 
technical assistance could be used to analyze electricity and fossil fuel subsidies 
and cross-subsidies. 
  Partial Risk Guarantees. If desired by private bidders, SREP contributions could 
also be used to provide guarantees to investors in utility-scale solar. The best 
form and purpose of the guarantee will need to be determined in parallel with 
the feasibility studies and market sounding (part of the transaction advisory) but 
guarantees could conceivably be used to reduce private investors risk related to 
regulatory changes, or changes in macro-economic variables that are difficult or 
unusually  expensive  to  hedge  (currency  fluctuation,  for  example)  for 
government and the private sector. 
5.1.2  Rooftop Solar 
Two delivery models are suitable for grid-connected rooftop solar in Bangladesh: 
78 
 
 
  Private ownership and operation. Private developers could be incentivized 
to  own  and  operate  a  rooftop  solar  arrays  through  two  possible 
arrangements: 
–  Feed-in-tariffs.  Investors  who  already  own  rooftops  (or  who  intend  to 
build  or  buy  them)  could  be  offered  a  fixed  fee  per  kWh  of  solar 
production,  with  guaranteed  offtake  for  the  life  of  the  facilities.  This 
arrangement  would  likely be  most  suitable  for  rooftop  solar  arrays  on 
large privately-owned roof areas, such as industrial or large commercial 
buildings. 
Competitive  tender  for  concession  areas.  This  is  similar  to  the  PPP  arrangement 
arrangement  described  above  for  utility-scale  solar  PV  projects.  In  this  model,  a 
model, a private investor is granted the right to develop a given site or aggregation of 
aggregation of sites. The investor agrees to make available a given capacity (MW), 
capacity (MW), and sell energy at an agreed price per MWh on a “take or pay” basis. 
or pay” basis. The solar rooftop programs in Gujarat and the Maldives present two 
present two possible PPP arrangements using the concession area approach. 
–  Box 5.1 summarizes the successful rooftop solar program in Gujarat and 
Box 5.2 describes the recently established Maldives program.  
  Public ownership and operation. The public sector could install and operate 
rooftop solar arrays on public buildings, including publicly-owned industries 
and other parastatals. SREP contributions and MDB financing could be used 
to invest in such projects. 
79 
 
 
Box 5.1: Gujarat Rooftop Solar Program 
In 2010, the Government of Gujarat launched its pilot solar rooftop program in the city of 
Gandhinagar,  the  state’s  capital.  The  IFC,  serving  as  transaction  advisor,  helped  Gujarat 
innovate  a  5  MW  solar  rooftop  public-private  partnership  (PPP)  project  to  add  power 
generating  capacity,  develop  contractual  models  for  further  solar  projects,  and 
demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of rooftop-based solar power. Under 
the PPP model used to finance Gujarat’s solar rooftop program, two private firms,  Azure 
Power and SunEdison, each won 25-year concessions for 2.5 MW solar rooftop projects. 
The two developers will install solar photovoltaic panels on the rooftops of public buildings 
and private residences and connect them to the grid in Gandhinagar. The 5 MW of power 
is saving over 7 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.  
Azure  Power  and  SunEdison  will  lease  rooftop  space  from  government  and  residential 
buildings.  The  building  owners  will  receive  Rupees  (Rs)  3  (or  US$0.05)  for  every  unit  of 
power  generated.  The  private  operators  are  responsible  for  installing  the  panels  and 
connecting them to the grid, for which they will receive a feed-in-tariff of Rs 11.21 ($0.18) 
per unit. 
One of the greatest successes of the pilot program has been its replicability for other cities 
in the state of Gujarat. The solar rooftop concept is being replicated in five other cities in 
Gujarat. A 25-year concession to implement Gujarat’s second solar rooftop PPP was signed 
in Vadodara in June 2014. IFC is helping implement similar PPP policy to finance rooftop 
solar programs in four other cities in Gujarat – Bhavnagar, Mehsana, Rajkot, and Surat.

Box 5.2: The Maldives Rooftop Solar Program 
The  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Maldives’  (GoM)  Accelerating  Sustainable  Private 
Investment in Renewable Energy (ASPIRE) is an SREP and World Bank funded initiative to 
support 20 MW of private sector investment in solar PV.  The first sub-project under ASPIRE, 
launched  in  April,  2015,  is  seeking  investors  for  4  MW  of  rooftop  solar  PV  systems  on 
identified public buildings in the Malé and Hulhumalé islands. 
The installation of the rooftop solar PV systems will be based on a Design, Build, Finance, 
Own, Operate, Transfer (DBFOOT) model for 20 years of ownership by the selected bidder. 
Investors will be selected and awarded according to the lowest bid tariff. Once the bid is 
awarded, the investor will sign a PPA with State Electric Company Limited (STELCO) to sell 
electricity  produced  by  the  PV  systems  to  STELCO  at  the  specified  rate  offered  by  the 
winning bidder. The roof spaces will be leased through separate agreements between the 
public entities that own the identified buildings and the selected bidder.

Priority activities for rooftop solar 
The rooftop solar PV projects would include the following activities: 
  Resource  assessment.  As  would  be  the  case  for  utility-scale  solar  PV,  more 
detailed  resource  assessment  is  needed  to  confirm  the  potential  for  rooftop 
solar PV, and lay foundation of further feasibility study and project development. 
As in Gujarat, an incremental approach may be used, beginning with one city or 
an area within a city.  
  Transaction advisory. The private sector transaction advisory arms of the MDBs 
could fulfill the transaction advisory role IFC fulfilled in Gujarat. Alternatively, IFC 
could  provide  support  in  identifying  or  structuring  projects.  For  example,  IFC 
may provide assistance on investment approaches for industries with potential 
for large solar rooftop arrays. Technical assistance could also be used to put in 
place feed-in tariffs. 
  Investment in projects. As for utility-scale solar, SREP contributions would be 
used  to  leverage  additional  IDA  financing,  financing  from  IFC  and  from  the 
private sector. Because of the highly distributed nature of some solar PV sites 
(residential  sites  in  particular),  financing  may  need  to  be  distributed  from  a 
financial intermediary to partner organizations, following the model IDCOL uses 
for other technologies. 
5.1.3  Utility-Scale Wind 
If the current wind mapping exercise shows a sufficient resource, and if there is private 
sector  interest,  SREP  funding  could  be  used  to  support  wind  projects.  The  delivery 
model and priority activities for utility-scale wind would be the same as for utility-scale 
solar.  
5.2  Off-grid Solar PV 
Bangladesh has ample, and successful experience with off-grid solar PV. As described 
in Section 3.1, solar home systems, solar irrigation pumps, and hybrid minigrids have 
already enjoyed considerable success. 
As described in Section 4, the dissemination of solar home systems program is well 
advanced and has begun to attract substantial private sector interest without the need 
for concessional financing. There is still room, however, for concessional financing to 
facilitate scale-up of the solar irrigation and mini-grid programs. SREP grant funding 
would therefore be used to leverage concessional financing from the MDBs to support 
the scale-up of solar irrigation technologies and hybrid minigrids. 
Financing would be on-lent through the Ministry of Finance and/or Bangladesh Bank 
to a financial intermediary. The financial intermediary would make grant funding or 
low-cost  financing  available  to  investors,  developers  or  end-users.  The  models 
currently used for these technologies are described in detail in Box 5.3. Similar models 
would be considered to deliver projects supported by SREP. 
81 
 
 
Box 5.3: Current Business Models for Solar Irrigation and Minigrids 
IDCOL currently finances solar irrigation pumps and hybrid minigrids in the following ways: 
  Solar irrigation. This program has two business models: the fee for service model, which 
is  currently  in  use,  and  the  proposed  ownership  model,  which  IDCOL  is  trying  to 
introduce. In the fee for service model, pump operators (private sector sponsors) put in 
20 percent of the project cost as equity and IDCOL provides 40 percent of the cost as a 
grant and the remaining 40 percent as credit at a 6 percent interest rate, to be repaid 
over  a  period  of  8  years.  The  grant  and  credit  funds  are  sourced  from  development 
partners.  There  are  currently  17  sponsor  organizations  which  have  implemented 
projects under this model. These sponsors purchase TSC-approved equipment (pumps 
and PV panels) from suppliers, who install the equipment and provide after-sale service. 
The sponsors own the pumps and sell water to farmers who pay an irrigation charge. 
Payments are collected by pump operators. The ownership model functions in a similar 
way for donors, IDCOL, and suppliers, but has POs (instead of sponsors) who sell the 
pump on cash/credit to farmers. Under this model farmers pay 60 percent of what the 
pump would cost without a grant. They make a 20 percent down-payment and pay the 
rest in yearly installments for 5 years, at a 15 percent interest rate. 
  Solar  minigrid  projects.  The  projects  are  implemented  through  sponsors,  who 
contribute 20% of projects costs from their own sources and receive 50% grant financing 
and 30% concessional financing from IDCOL. The concessional loans have a 6 percent 
interest rate and are paid in quarterly installments over a maximum of 10 years, with a 
2  year  grace  period.  The  grants  and  concessionary  loans  are  sourced  from  the 
development partners. Sponsors include NGOs, micro-finance institutions and private 
sector companies. Sponsors hire O&M contractors, which provide O&M solutions, and 
EPC  contractors,  which  purchase  equipment  from  suppliers  and  provide  turnkey 
solutions. The sponsors provide grid connections to customers (including small shops, 
health centers, schools, etc.), who pay tariffs to the sponsors. 
 
Priority activities 
The off-grid solar PV projects would include: 
  Investments in solar irrigation, or solar minigrids. Approximately 25 MW 
of new minigrid and 13 MW of solar PV pump capacity would be installed. 
Financing would be on-lent to a financial intermediary and then on-lent to 
various partner organizations, developers, sponsors or end-users.  
  Technical assistance in minigrid business models and regulation. Minigrids 
have,  as  noted  in  Section  3.4,  experienced  a  number  of  challenges  in 
Bangladesh,  related  to how  they  are  planned,  regulated  and  operated  as 
business. SREP funding would be used, as part of the project preparation to 
fund a study aimed at diagnosing the problems experienced with minigrids 
in  Bangladesh  and  identify  possible  improvements  to  the  regulatory 
environment or possible alternative business models for the MDBs or IDCOL 
to consider. 
5.3  Waste to Energy Advisory Support 
SREP support would be used to support the development of  a municipal Waste-to-
Energy (WtE) project for Bangladesh. As noted in Section 3.1.7, the challenges to WtE 
are more managerial than technological. The principal challenges to WtE project in the 
82 
 
 
past  have  been  primarily  in  the  waste  management  functions  required  to  provide 
feedstock for a WtE plant. 
Priority Activities 
SREP support would be used for advisory support, which would identify the technical 
and  commercial  options  for  developing  a  WtE  plant.  The  work  would  include  the 
development  of  a  feasibility  study  and  “business  case”  to  consider  options  for 
ownership  and  operation.  Such options  would  include  a  purely public  arrangement 
(government  owned  and  operated);  and  various  types  of  PPP  arrangements  (for 
example, management contracts, leases, or concessions). Support could be provided 
by the World Bank. 
5.4  Program Implementation Arrangements 
SREDA will be responsible for the coordination of Bangladesh’s SREP Program. As the 
institution established by the GoB to promote renewable energy in Bangladesh, SREDA 
has  the  functional  authority  needed  to  coordinate  the  activities  and  ensure 
compliance  with  monitoring  and  evaluation  requirements  of  the  development 
partners. Implementing agencies will submit quarterly/semi-annual reports to SREDA 
who  will  then  submit  an  annual  report  to  the  CIF  Administration  Unit  through  the 
World Bank. 
The detailed implementation arrangements will be worked out as the specific projects 
are  prepared  and  appraised  by  the  respective  MDBs.  Different  components  of  the 
SREP  program  may  have  different  implementation  agencies  based  on  the  specific 
nature  of  the  project  (private  or  public-private  partnership).  A  preliminary 
implementation  arrangement  is  described  below,  which  may  change  depending  on 
the outcome of individual project appraisals.  
5.4.1  Grid-Connected Renewable Energy 
The  Grid-Connected  Renewable  Energy  Project  will  be  implemented  by  the  World 
Bank  Group  including  the  IFC.  For  the  IDA  supported  grid-tied  project,  a  credit 
line/refinancing  facility  will  be  established  at 
IDCOL,  a  government-owned 
infrastructure finance company. IDCOL has been managing the successful renewable 
energy program of the World Bank (IDA) since 2003 under the RERED program that 
includes the flagship SHS program. IDCOL is run by professional management under 
effective  oversight  by  a  competent  Board.  Following  the  successful  SHS  program, 
IDCOL  has  been  replicating  the  public-private  partnership  arrangement  of  the  SHS 
program for renewable energy based mini-grids and solar irrigation pumps as well. As 
a company, IDCOL is able to offer market based incentive package to its management 
and  staff.  IDCOL  will be responsible  for  day-to-day  management  of the component 
following Bank's fiduciary guidelines and procedures. It will also be responsible for the 
monitoring  of  the  component's  activities  and  results  and  submission  of 
quarterly/semi-annual reports to SREDA.  
5.4.2  Off-Grid Solar PV 
The Off-Grid Solar PV Project will be implemented by ADB. The technical and financial 
business models for scaling up solar irrigation; mini-grids; and hybrid power systems, 
as  well  as  appropriate  institutional  arrangements  will  be  developed  based  on  the 
experiences of existing programs, and harmonized with existing successful business 
83 
 
 
models in the market (i.e., IDCOL). The detailed implementation arrangement for the 
SREP  off-grid  support  to  be  managed  by  ADB  will  be  worked  out  during  project 
appraisal,  and  coordinated  with  Power  Division,  Rural  Electrification  Board  of 
Bangladesh (REB) and SREDA. 
5.4.3  Development Support for Waste to Energy  
The  Waste-to-Energy  advisory  support  would  be  implemented  through  the  World 
Bank. Advisory services would be procured using World Bank procurement rules and 
SREDA would act as the client of the advisors. SREDA could partner with other local 
implementation agencies, most likely this would include IDCOL or Power Division with 
support  from  local  university  renewable  energy  institutes  such  as  the  Institute  of 
Renewable  Energy  of  Dhaka  University  (“IRE”)  or  the  Center  for  Energy  Studies  at 
Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (“CES”). 
5.5 
Utility-scale  solar,  off-grid  solar  PV, utility-scale wind,  and  waste-to  energy  all  have 
potential  environmental,  social,  and  gender-related  co-benefits.  Sections  5.5.1  to 
5.5.5 describe potential co-benefits from these technologies.  
Environmental, Social and Gender-Related Co-Benefits 
5.5.1  Labor and working conditions 
  Some opportunities for local employment (paid and voluntary) and ‘on-the-
job’ training in relation to the preparatory works and deployment of these 
power  sources  (for  example  fixing  of  roof-mounted  solar  PV  panels; 
clearance of trees and vegetation; and, erection of electricity distribution 
poles  under  skilled  supervision).  Depending  on  the  business  models,  this 
in  sales, 
may  also  be 
maintenance and fee collection roles. 
likely  to  provide  employment  opportunities 
  Opportunities  for  skills  training,  educational  events  or  mechanisms  for 
encouraging jobs for women and marginalized communities. This could lead 
to poverty alleviation, increased average earnings and increased GVA per 
capita. 
  Utility-scale  projects,  and  some  off-grid  projects  offer  the  promise  of 
transport infrastructure improvements, as better roads will be needed to 
provide  maintenance  access  to  sites  required  for  utility-scale  RE  sites. 
Transport infrastructure improvements result in secondary benefits to local 
residents, businesses, and tourists. 
  Grid-connected  projects  can  improve  the  reliability  of  energy  supply, 
benefitting  a  wide  range  of  economic  sectors  and  encouraging  new  and 
existing businesses. 
  A waste-to-energy project may also (depending on the plant design) offer 
heat  as  an  important  by-product.  The  heat  could  be  used  by  industrial 
customers near the plant. 
5.5.2  Resource efficiency and pollution prevention 
  The grid-connected projects can improve resource efficiency and prevent 
pollution by providing better reliability of supply, reducing the use of back-
84 
 
 
up diesel generators, and thus reducing the NOx, SOx and carbon dioxide 
emissions resulting from diesel combustion. 
  The  off-grid technologies  will  reduce  the use  of traditional  fuels,  thereby 
reducing air pollution from combustion of these fuels, but also reducing the 
river  sedimentation  and  marine  and  coastal  pollution  arising  from 
deforestation. 
  Utility scale solar, off-grid solar PV, and utility-scale wind have the potential 
to reduce water resource usage compared to fossil fuel technologies, which 
require the abstraction of water for cooling. They also have the potential to 
improve surface water quality compared to fossil fuel technologies, which 
require discharge of treated effluents.  
  Waste-to-energy  has  an  added  benefit  from  production,  because  by-
products (e.g. bottom-ash and residual metals) have market value. 
5.5.3  Community health and safety 
  Electricity  from  off-grid  technologies  may  partially  replace  the  use  of 
indigenous fuels, which produce harmful indoor pollutants. 
  Potential  to  improve  access  to,  or  reliability  of  electricity  supply  for 
hospitals,  health  centers,  and  clinics.  This  is  especially  true  for  hybrid 
minigrid projects where the combination of solar and diesel can provide 24-
hour  electricity  service  suitable  for  refrigeration,  sterilization,  and  the 
offering of nighttime medical services. 
  Utility-scale solar can be designed to alleviate the impacts of climate change 
events locally by incorporating sustainable drainage into sites, as a way of 
mitigating flood risks 
  Waste-to-energy  can  stimulate  improvements  in  waste  management  and 
recycling/disposal, sanitation and quality of life.  There is also potential to 
improve  community-level  materials  handling/  waste  recycling  facilities  as 
part of a waste management regime for solar PV (especially batteries and 
solar PV panels). 
5.5.4 
Indigenous people and cultural heritage 
  For  utility-scale  projects,  there  would  be  the  opportunity  to  use  cultural 
heritage  surveys,  as  part  of  the  ESIA  process,  to  identify,  document  and 
protect  culturally  important  areas/artefacts  for  the  long-term  benefit  of 
Affected Communities. 
  Off-grid  solar  PV  provides  an  opportunity  for  the  empowerment  of 
indigenous  people,  by  providing  them  with  energy  sources  they  did  not 
have before, and allowing them to manage or own energy sources. 
5.5.5  Gender 
  Better  quality  lighting,  and  additional  hours  of  lighting  have  security 
benefits (especially when public areas are lit). 
85 
 
 
  Solar lighting has educational benefits, allowing for longer hours of study in 
brighter  light,  while  solar  home  systems  allow  more  homes  to  have  a 
television and benefit from educational and health programming.  
  Women, children, and the elderly benefit relatively more from lower use of 
traditional fuels, as they are typically at risk of higher exposure to indoor 
pollutants associated with burning of wood, dung or garbage. 
  Potential for operational agreements for the renewable energy projects to 
target the encouragement of jobs for women. 
5.6 
Utility-scale  solar,  off-grid  solar  PV, utility-scale wind,  and  waste-to  energy  all  have 
environmental  and  social  risks.  Many  of  these  risks  are  the  same  across  the  RE 
technologies,  but  each  technology  also  has  its  own  unique  risks  to  be  considered. 
Sections 5.6.1 to 5.6.7 describe some of the risk related to these technologies.  
Environmental and Social Risks 
5.6.1  Labor and working conditions 
  Lack of locally trained professionals could give rise to the need for either 
local professionals to travel overseas for training or for imported technical 
expertise. This could result in the displacement of the local population, as 
well as an increased cost-of-living 
  Unsafe  or  unhealthy  working  conditions  and  poor  health  of  workers  can 
arise  if  measures  are  not  in  place  to  promote  safe  and  healthy  working 
conditions, especially for vulnerable categories of workers such as children, 
workers engaged by third parties and workers in the supply chain. 
  For waste-to-energy and utility-scale projects, transportation of people and 
equipment  might  impact  traffic  patterns  during  construction  near  the 
project site. 
5.6.2  Resource efficiency and pollution prevention 
  Potential for air emissions during the construction stage (vehicle emissions, 
particulate  matter  and  dust),  due  to  material  transportation  and  on-site 
plant movements. 
  Waste-to-energy plants cause air quality emissions from flue gas (including 
CO2, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide amongst many 
others). These emissions can give rise to risks of acidification of soils and 
water bodies. 
  Utility-scale solar and solar PV have a risk of pollution from the generation, 
handling  and  disposal  of  waste  during  construction,  maintenance  and 
decommissioning. This is a special risk for solar PV because there may be 
hazardous materials in solar PV panels (such as gallium arsenide, copper-
indium-gallium-diselenide and cadmium-telluride). Lead-sulfate dust from 
lead-acid batteries, and mercury from compact florescent lighting are also 
pollution risks. 
86 
 
 
  Off-grid  solar  PV,  and  utility-scale  projects  have  a  risk  of  polluting  water 
bodies  due  to  potential  erosion  and  mobilization  of  sediments  by  the 
construction of the plant and inappropriate storage of polluting materials. 
5.6.3  Community health, safety and security 
  Risk of detrimental health effects on local communities through dust and 
other particulate matter during construction. 
  Waste-to-energy  health  concerns  include  odor,  litter,  flies/vermin/birds 
and noise emissions.  
  Unauthorized  access  to  utility-scale  structures  is  a  safety  concern  (for 
example, unauthorized climbing of turbine structures).  
  Risk  of  damage  to  the  RE  infrastructure  due  to  increased  frequency  and 
severity of floods, tropical storms, storm surges and sea level rise associated 
with climate change. 
  Utility-scale solar and minigrids have the potential for increased flood risk 
in  high-risk  flood  areas  due  to  clearing  of  vegetation  for  the  generation 
plant, materials holding and storage areas.  
  Utility-scale projects and minigrids may cause disturbances to communities, 
arising from construction (including vibration, blasting, clearing and grading 
site), operation and decommissioning such as noise, traffic, vibration, odor, 
shadow flicker and blade glint.  
  Utility-scale wind has the risk of electromagnetic interference with aviation 
radar  and  telecommunication  systems  (including  microwave,  radio  and 
television).68 
5.6.4  Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement 
  Utility-scale projects  and  off-grid  solar  PV  have the potential  risk  of  sunk 
cost in infrastructure if poorly planned and located in high-risk flood areas 
or in the path of sea level rise. 
  Utility-scale  projects  and  waste-to-energy  present  possible  conflicts  with 
land  owners  as  a  result  of  the  need  for  loss  of  existing  land  (such  as 
temporary  or  permanent  loss  of  farmers’  croplands),  resettlement  or 
displacement of other economic activities. In particular, conflict could arise 
in  areas  of  community  land  ownership,  where  cultural  sensitivities  and 
landowner negotiations can be particularly difficult. 
5.6.5  Biodiversity  conservation  and  sustainable  management  of  living  natural 
resources 
  Utility-scale  projects  and  waste-to-energy  have  the  potential 
for 
construction  works  and  operational  equipment  to  result  in  the  loss  of 
habitat, habitat fragmentation and impacts on ecosystem services.

approach/risk+management/ehsguidelines 
87 
 
 
  Utility-scale projects have the risk of soil erosion and degradation as a result 
of stripping the working area for infrastructure during construction. 
  Utility-scale solar could cause ecological impacts in local water bodies as a 
result of sediment deposition from storm water runoff.  
  Utility-scale  wind  could  impact  populations  of  bird  species  due  to  strikes 
associated with turbines or transmission lines, and could impact bats due to 
vibration and noise.  
  Utility-scale  wind  has  a  risk  of  harm  to  fauna  arising  from  partial 
decommissioning, and leaving residual infrastructure or polluting materials 
in place. 
  Utility-scale wind construction and maintenance activities for land grading, 
in-ground  equipment  could  cause  disturbances  of 
foundations  and 
contaminated soils and sediments. 
5.6.6 
Indigenous peoples and cultural heritage 
  Ethnic  disputes  over  placement  of  energy  generating  equipment  and 
ancillary infrastructure 
  Potential loss or damage to cultural and natural sites due to construction or 
operation of schemes, including nationally and regionally registered areas, 
unknown or unregistered cultural heritage sites and intangible cultural and 
heritage assets 
  Visual  impacts  of  RE  generation  infrastructure  upon  the  landscape,  with 
potential impacts on the scenic value of Reserves, Sanctuaries and National 
Parks (For example, the stack of a waste-to-energy plant) 
5.6.7  Other cross-cutting topics 
  Utility-scale  projects  have  a  risk  of  pollution  to  water  bodies  (including 
surface  water  and  groundwater  supplies)  arising  from  construction 
activities. 
  Off-grid  solar PV  has  a  risk  of  sulfate  contamination  in  surrounding  lands 
and  water  bodies  (including  groundwater)  due  to  improper  disposal  and 
recycling of lead-acid storage batteries.  
  Waste-to-energy  has  a  risk  to  water  resource  availability,  surface  water 
quality and aquatic ecology (likely abstraction and cooling water discharge 
requirement).  
  Utility-scale  projects  and  minigrids  have  a  risk  of  localized  geological 
damage as a result of creating foundations for RE generation infrastructure 
and laying transmission networks.

Table 6.1 presents a plan for financing the projects described in Section 5. It shows the 
proposed  credits  and  grants  from  SREP  as  well  as  estimates  of  the  amounts 
anticipated from MDBs and the private sector.  
Financing Plan and Instruments 
88 
 
 
As the table shows, roughly US$ 75 million of SREP funding is expected to catalyse 
over eight times as much investment, most of it from the private sector (as equity or 
debt), and the public sector lending windows of the MDBs. 
The exact financing modalities will be determined at the time of appraisal, but it is 
expected that: 
  Roughly US$44.45 million of SREP funding would be used to leverage US$ 
100 million in IDA financing from the World Bank, US$100 million in a PRG 
or  similar  instrument  if  required,  $30m  of  IFC  investment,  and  US$190 
million  in  investment  from  other  private  sector  investors  for  utility-scale 
renewable  energy  plants  (primarily  solar  but  possibly  also  wind),  and 
rooftop solar. 
  Roughly US$ 29.95 million of SREP grant funding would be used to leverage 
US$ 140 million in concessional financing from ADB for solar irrigation and 
hybrid minigrid projects. 
  The World Bank would provide support for an assessment of technical and 
commercial feasibility of a municipal waste-to-energy project. 
The Government of Bangladesh will contribute by facilitating fiscal incentives for 
services associated with the financing plan.

As described in Section 4, the investments associated with the SREP investment plan 
represent the first phase of two-phase investment program planned by Government. 
Support for Phase II will be sought from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The second 
phase will include  a continuation of the grid-connected renewable energy projects, 
clean cookstoves program, and the waste-to-energy project launched as part of Phase 
1, with SREP assistance.   
Table  6.2  shows  financing  plan  for  Phase  II  of  Bangladesh’s  investment  plan.  The 
numbers are meant for the purposes of rough illustration only, and do not imply any 
commitment made by GCF, the Government of Bangladesh, the MDBs or any other 
parties. 
More specifically, the Phase 2 program would include: 
  Grid-Connected Renewables II. This project will be an expanded version of 
the  project  from  Phase  1  with  the  aim  of  supporting  the  GoB’s  RE 
Development  Targets  for  2021  (see  Section  2.4.3).  The  financing plan for 
this project includes more than US$ 3.4 billion in funds for: 
–  Utility-scale solar. The plan for Phase 2 would be to achieve the goal of 
having 1,221 MW of utility-scale solar by 2021 through the financing of 
the remaining target MWs needed after Phase 1. The focus in this phase 
would be to reduce the role played by MDBs and increase private sector 
activity.      
–  Utility-scale wind. A major emphasis of Phase 2 would be to kick-start the 
expansion  of  utility-scale  wind.  MDBs  would  provide  the  majority  of 
financing in order to support wind similar to how utility-scale solar would 
be supported in Phase 1. The plan provides total financing sufficient to 
achieve the 637 MW technical potential for utility-scale wind found in 
Section  3.1.4.  This  installed  capacity  is  nearly  half  of  the  GoB’s  2021 
target.      
–  Rooftop solar. The target for 2021 is to have 48 MW of rooftop solar. The 
plan  for  Phase  2  is  for  MDB  support  any  remaining  MWs  needed  to 
achieve  the  target  and  have  an  additional  110  MW  (approximately  25 
percent  of technical  potential found in  Section 3.1.2) in  private  sector 
investment.   
–  Small hydropower. GoB has a target to install 4 MW in small hydropower 
by 2021. The plan includes sufficient financing to cover installation of 3-4 
small HPPs at sites with 1-2 MW in technical potential.   
  Clean Cookstoves. The clean cookstove project includes US$ 519.2 million 
in funds for the installation of ICS and biogas plants. Existing MDB programs 
have  sufficient  funds  for  these  technologies  through  2018.  The  financing 
plan in this project would aim to continue these existing programs in order 
to support the  national goals of installing 30,000 million ICS and 100,000 
biogas plants. ICS support would be provided through the provision of low 
cost  financing  to  the  POs  that  are  installing  ICS.  Biogas  plants  would  be 
supported  through  a  mix  of  capital  buy  down  grants  and  concessional 
91 
 
 
grants.  In  total,  this  Phase  2  project  would  cover  the  financing  of 
approximately 20 million ICS and 65,000 biogas plants.  
  Waste to Energy Program. This project supports the GoB’s goals to have the 
installed capacity to generate 40 MW from municipal waste; 7 MW from 
biomass; and 7 MW from biogas by 2021. The municipal waste to energy 
project would be developed based on the results of the feasibility study in 
Phase 1. The biomass and biogas financing plan follows the existing models 
to  use  a  mix  of  grants,  concessional  loans,  and  private  equity  for  these 
projects.

connected rooftop PV in 
major urban areas. 
SREP resources could be used 
to finance the development 
of utility-scale wind via 
private investment (through 
a feed-in tariff or reverse 
auctions) or public 
investment (via on-lending 
from MoF). 
SREP resources could be used 
to finance the development 
of 6 MW of solar irrigation 
(through a fee-for-service or 
an ownership model) and 25 
MW of minigrids (through 
sponsors, grant financing and 
concessional financing). 
SREP support could be used 
to support the development 
of municipal WtE schemes, 
through financing a feasibility 
study and business case, 
providing viability-gap 
funding and lending to (or 
investment in) the WtE PPP 
company.

WtE leads to air quality 
emissions from flue gas 
(including CO2, sulphur 
dioxide, nitrogen oxide and

many others) but will 
displace diesel powered 
generation.  
Affordability and 
competitiveness of 
renewable resources 
The rapid decline in solar PV 
and battery costs in recent 
years has made utility-scale 
solar more affordable and 
more competitive with diesel 
generation and likely future 
sources of baseload power 
(e.g., imported coal and 
LNG). 
Grid-connected wind is 
competitive with diesel 
generation and likely future 
sources of baseload power 
(e.g., imported coal and 
LNG). 
Off-grid solar could provide 
power for irrigation at 
cheaper rates than diesel, 
though only replacement of 
large diesel pumps on 3-4 
crop land are considered 
viable. Concessional financing 
makes minigrids and solar 
irrigation competitive with 
diesel generation. 
The cost of WtE schemes 
depend on the introduction 
of efficient waste collection 
processes. With efficient 
collection, WtE is competitive 
with diesel and coal. 
Productive use of energy 
Grid-connected technologies increase access to energy 
supply and could lead to an increase in new businesses, 
supplying new development and workforce, increasing local 
tax returns and diversifying local business base.

lower cost than diesel or coal 
generation. 
The supply curves shown in 
Section 3.3 confirm that grid-

lower cost than diesel or coal 
generation. 
The supply curves shown in 
Section 3.3 confirm that off-

with concessional financing. 
The supply curves shown in 
Section 3.3 confirm that WtE, 
with either concessional or

Leveraging of additional 
resources 
Investments from the private sector, MDBs, and government are estimated to leverage 8.7 times the amount contributed by 
SREP. 
Gender 
Grid-connected technologies create the potential for skills 
training and education for the empowerment of women. 
WtE could provide vocational 
skills training and educational 
opportunities which could 
benefit women. 
Off-grid solar can lead to 
skills training and education, 
and the empowerment of 
women through better 
lighting and longer hours of 
electricity and associated 
security benefits at night. 
Off-grid solar also reduces air 
pollution compared to use of 
fossil fuel technologies, 
improving respiratory health 
in women.

Implementation Potential with Risk Assessment 
The  implementation  risk  of  the  IP  in  Bangladesh  is  moderate.  The  main  risks  are 
regulatory and financial. 
For  the  on-grid  projects,  it  is  not  yet  clear  how  rights  to  own  and  operate  grid-
connected  RE  plants  will  be  awarded  and  how  the  investors  and  operators  will  be 
remunerated. The financial risks are related to the fact that end-user tariffs are still 
well below the cost of supply, meaning that fiscal subsidies are required to cover the 
difference between utility revenue and the cost at which a private bidder would be 
willing to sell power to the grid. 
For the off-grid project, the biggest risk is one of stranded assets. There is a risk that 
transmission expansion or customer anticipation of grid expansion, will stifle interest 
in  investment  in  off-grid  technologies,  as  rural  areas  await  electricity  connections 
instead of investing in their own sources of supply. Off-grid RE also requires a large 
upfront  investment  which,  while  on  a  levelized  basis  may  be  cheaper  than  using  a 
diesel generator, can require substantial upfront payments. 
Most of these risks can be mitigated by project preparation, as can environmental and 
social  risks.  The  GoB  has  well-established  processes  for  mitigating  social  and 
environmental issues associated with the proposed projects, and ensuring that these 
be managed in accordance with World Bank and/or ADB safeguard requirements as 
applicable. Legislation for environmental impact assessments (EIAs) in Bangladesh is 
provided by the Environmental Policy (1992), Environmental Conservation Act (ECA, 
1995)  and  the  Environmental  Conservation  Rules  (ECR,  1997).  The  ECA  requires  all 
industrial  units  and  projects  to  receive  Environmental  Clearance  Certificates  (ECCs) 
from  the  Department  of  Environment.  The  ECR  describes  the  processes  and 
requirements  for  obtaining  ECCs,  and  classifies  projects  into  four  categories  of 
environmental impact and location: Green, Orange A, Orange B and Red. Projects with 
low environmental impact are issued a Green ECC. All other projects must receive a 
site clearance certificate before obtaining an ECC. Applications for Orange B and Red 
projects  must  be  accompanied  by  a  feasibility  report  on  initial  environmental 
examination,  EIA  and  an  environmental  management  plan.  Once  granted,  the  ECC 
must  be  renewed  every  three  years  for  Green  projects,  and  every  year  for  other 
categories. Figure 8.1 below lays out the procedure for obtaining an ECC.

9  Monitoring and Evaluation 
The investments proposed in this plan has the potential to transform grid-connected 
electricity  generation  in  Bangladesh,  moving  the  country  from  a  dependence  on 
emergency,  thermal  generation  to  utility-scale  solar,  wind,  and  waste-to-energy.  It 
would  also  expand  the  use  of  promising  off-grid  technologies  for  households  and 
agriculture, building on the success of existing programs.  
A monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system will be established by the Government, in 
cooperation with the MDBs and other donor partners, for the purpose of tracking and 
reporting on progress in reaching SREP impacts and outcomes. The M&E framework 
will be coordinated by SREDA. 
Table 9.1 summarizes the proposed monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for 
Bangladesh’s SREP IP.

69 The Revised SREP results framework (2012) says that this indicator should be a  “National measure of ‘energy 
poverty’  such  as  the  Multi-dimensional  Energy  Poverty  Index  (MEPI),  or  some  equivalent  mutually  agreed 
measure.” Energy poverty is indeed a multi-dimensional problem which includes problems associated with a 
lack of access to sufficient energy supply, a lack of access to clean energy, and a lack of access to affordable 
energy. The case in Bangladesh is the lack of adequate supply of electricity for those connected to the grid, as 
well as lack of access to electricity for off-grid areas where even solar home systems have not reached. Access 
indicators are therefore used to measure energy poverty. A more robust survey for multi-tier access is currently 
being planned under a World Bank-supported project.

Appendix A:  Assessment  of  Bangladesh’s  Absorptive 
Capacity 
This appendix contains an assessment of Bangladesh’s ability to absorb the financing 
envisioned  as  part  of  Phase  I  of  the  investment  plan  and  the  ability  of  relevant 
government agencies to implement the projects identified. 
A.1  Debt Sustainability 
The amount of Bangladesh's debt has increased over time, but its debt-to-GDP ratio 
has decreased. Economic expansion and consistent annual growth has put Bangladesh 
at a low risk of debt distress, with a debt-to-GDP ratio below the 42.8 percent regional 
average.71 
According  to  recent  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  analysis,  when  subject  to 
multiple macroeconomic shocks, there is a 50 percent chance that Bangladesh's debt-
to-GDP ratio would stay between 36 and 40 percent (and thus a 50 percent chance 
the debt-to GDP ratio would be either above 40 percent or below 36 percent). Even if 
Bangladesh experienced a combination of negative macro-economic shocks, with no 
positive  macroeconomic  shocks, the  debt-to-GDP  ratio  would  still  remain below 42 
percent. Appendix Figure  A.1: shows Bangladesh's recent debt-to-GDP ratios, along 
with IMF projections up to the year 2019. 
Appendix Figure A.1: IMF Debt to GDP Projections, 2003-2019 
 
 
As of the third quarter of FY 2014, the composition of Bangladesh's public debt was 
65 percent external and 35 percent domestic (see Appendix Figure A.2).72 According 
to the Ministry of Finance, the cost of external debt has been low for Bangladesh, since 
most  of  this  debt  is  in  the  form  of  concessional  loans  from  IDA,  ADB  and  Japan. 
Recently,  external  borrowing  has  been  increasing,  partially  due  to  Bangladesh 
receiving a smaller share of grant aid in the external aid package. These external loans 
have  an  average  10-year  grace period  and  an  average  20  year  repayment  period.73

The  Ministry  of  Finance  acknowledges  a  concern  that  interest  rate  payments  are  a 
"substantial  burden  on  the  budget".  Appendix  Figure  A.4  illustrates  a  projection  of 
external  debt  service  payments,  showing  both  principal  and  interest  payments.  By 
continuing  its  efforts  to  maximize  its  share  of  grant  aid  and  seek  low  interest 
concessional  loans  (such  as  those  provided  by  SREP  and  as  leverage  from  MDBs), 
Bangladesh can minimize the burden that interest rates have on the budget, while still 
obtaining the financing needed to meet development goals.

In accordance with the National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (NSAPR), 
the Bangladesh Ministry of Finance has taken on debt management reform measures, 
and  has  developed  strategies  for  public  debt  management.74 This  strategy  includes 
pursuing  stable  and  low-cost  financing,  developing  a  well-functioning  government 
securities market, and minimizing the risks involved with debt management, in order 
to promote debt sustainability in the medium-term.  
A.2 
Financing  will  be  channelled  through  the  Economic  Relations  Division  (ERD)  of  the 
Ministry of Finance and/or Bangladesh Bank. SREDA will be the principal coordinating 
agency  for  the  projects,  and  will  be  responsible  for  applying  the  monitoring  and 
evaluation  framework  outlined  in  Section  9.  These  institutions  have  extensive 
experience implementing and coordinating programs financed by the MDBs. 
Implementing Agency Capacity 
A  number  of  non-bank  financial  intermediaries  (NBFIs)  may  be  involved  in  various 
aspects  of  the  investment  program.75 It  is  expected  that  the  financial  intermediary 
most appropriate for each investment will be selected in conjunction with the MDBs 
responsible for each particular project. 
The  financial  intermediaries  which  may  be  involved  in  various  aspects  of  this 
investment plan include: 
  The  Infrastructure  Development  Company  (IDCOL),  described  in  earlier 
sections. IDCOL was established in 1997 as an implementing agency which 
on-lends  grants  and  loans  to  partner  organizations  who  in  turn  procure, 
install, and often times refinance loans to households. It has established a 
track  record  in  managing  donor  funds  successfully  in  off-grid  renewable 
energy. 
  The Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited (BIFFL), incorporated 
on  21  March  2011  as  a  public  limited  company  with  capital  of  roughly 
US$200 million. The fund is licensed by Bangladesh Bank to operate as an 
NBFI  under  the  Financial  Institutions  Act,  1993.  BIFFL’s  objective  is  to 
provide  predominantly  long-term  financing  for  PPP  projects  through  the 
issuance of bonds, debt instruments, and equity offerings.  
  Investment  Promotion  and  Financing  Facility  (IPFF).  IPFF  is  a  financing 
facility  at  Bangladesh  Bank.  IPFF  finances  PPP  projects.  Its  objective  is  to 
accelerate  private  sector-led  growth  by  providing  term  financing  for 
infrastructure development and promoting domestic infrastructure finance 
capacity. IPFF can work through a range of participating NBFI’s including, for 
Infrastructure  Development  Finance 
example, 
Company, Ltd). IIFDC is a participating non-bank financial institution of IPFF, 
with  the  objectives  are  to  finance  investments  in  infrastructure  and 
industrial sector.

experience in the energy sector.

Relevant Experience 
IDCOL 
As described in Section 3.5, IDCOL has extensive experience appraising and on-
lending to MDB financing to energy sector projects, including off-grid RE 
projects and traditional, thermal power plant projects (IDCOL was 
instrumental in financing for the Meghnaghat and Haripur combined cycle gas 
turbine (CCGT) projects 
BIFFL 
BIFFL has not yet financed any projects in the power sector or worked as an 
intermediary for MDB financing. 
IPFF 
Roughly US$ 60 million of power sector projects have been financed through 
IPFF, adding 178 MW of electricity to the national grid. An additional $300 
million in MDB financing has been allocated for on-lending in the 2nd Phase of 
IPFF, extending the project tenure up to 31 December 2015. 
 
Direct on-lending to commercial banks may also be an alternative to working through 
NBFIs, but commercial banks in Bangladesh are typically conservative in their lending 
because of a lack of capacity for appraisals and risk assessment, and, to some extent, 
regulatory  requirements  for  liquidity.  Lending  to  RE  projects  may  look  risky  in 
comparison to their traditional markets in corporate and consumer lending.

B.1  Grid-Connected Solar  
PROBLEM STATEMENT 
1.  Power  supply  shortages continue  to be  a  problem  in  Bangladesh.  The  country’s 
increased  urban  population  and  sustained  economic  growth  has  led  to  an  18 
percent increase in peak electricity demand from 2011 to 2014. Load shedding is 
common  from  April  to  September,  when  demand  peaks  at  over  8,000  MW. 
Government has minimized energy shortages by contracting with expensive liquid 
fuel-run  rental  power  plants  (RPPs)  as  a  short  term  solution  while  awarding 
contracts for several large independent power plants (IPPs) run on coal and natural 
gas.    New  capacity  from  RPPs  has  improved  power  supply  in  recent  years—
maximum load shed has declined since May 2012, and total load shed days have 
decreased.  However,  the  large  and  relatively  cheaper  base  load  IPPs  have  not 
come  into  operation  in  time,  with  many  of  them  significantly  delayed  due  to 
sponsors’ inability to reach financial closure.  While RPPs have added much needed 
capacity,  they  do  not  represent  a  sustainable  long-term  solution  to  energy 
shortfalls. Sustained GDP growth of six percent per year could lead to an increase 
in  annual  demand  of  62  percent  by  2020  and  207  percent  by  2030.  If  power 
demand continues to grow at the projected rate, an average of 829 MW per year 
needs to be installed over the next 15 years to meet peak demand in 2030. 
2.  Bangladesh  also  faces  challenges  in  the  form  of  depletion  of  natural  gas,  the 
primary fuel for power generation. It has been estimated that Bangladesh’s natural 
gas  reserves  will  be  depleted  before  2020.  Declining  indigenous  resources  and 
increasing  demand  has  caused  Bangladesh  to  increasingly  depend  on  imported 
fuel oil. The increase in fuel oil consumption has been driven by BPDB reliance on 
fuel oil based RPPs to mitigate energy shortages. From 2009 to 2015, the share of 
oil-fired electricity has increased from 5 to 20 percent (correspondingly reducing 
the share of natural gas for power generation). This increase in oil fired electricity 
contributed  to  the  fuel  cost  per  kWh  generated  going  up  from  1.1  to  3.42 
taka/kWh (US$ 0.014 to US$ 0.04) over the same period. This leaves Bangladesh’s 
energy sector vulnerable to oil price shocks in the international market. 
PROJECT OBJECTIVE 
3.  The project aims to increase energy reliability and security by developing a market 
for grid-connected renewable energy. The objective of this project is to support 
the  Government  of  Bangladesh  overcome  key  barriers  that  prevent  the  growth 
and expansion of the utility-scale renewable energy market in Bangladesh. 
The projects consists of three components: 
  Component 1 involves investments in utility-scale solar and wind, as well as 
rooftop solar. SREP contributions would be used to leverage additional IDA 
financing, financing from IFC and from the private sector to achieve financial 
closure. This component will be implemented in two ways: (a) by the World 
Bank establishing a credit line or refinancing facility at IDCOL, a government-
owned infrastructure finance company, to support winning bidders of the 
108 
 
 
competitive  tenders;  and  (b)  by  IFC  in  the  form  of  direct  investment  in 
early/first private sector utility-scale RE plants. In addition, the World Bank 
would  offer  partial  risk  guarantees  to  reduce  risks  that  private  sector 
investors face, if there is a need from private sector bidders.  
  Component 2 involves resource assessment. SREP grant funds could be used 
to fund more detailed resource assessments, and identification of possible 
sites  and possible  projects.  For utility-scale  solar,  more detailed  resource 
assessment  than  existing  data  will  be  needed  to  characterize  the  solar 
resource potential in the areas targeted for solar development. For rooftop 
solar,  a  more  detailed  mapping  exercise  is  needed  to  determine  all  the 
suitable rooftops in the largest urban areas. Combined with other ongoing 
resource  assessment,  this  component  would  enable  national  resource 
mapping, which will facilitate further potential investment in solar PV. If the 
current wind mapping exercise shows sufficient resource potential, and if 
there is private sector interest, SREP funding could be used to support wind 
projects.  The  delivery  model  and  priority  activities  for  utility-scale  wind 
would be the same as for utility-scale solar.  
  Component 3 involves transaction advisory for tendering projects identified 
by feasibility studies. IFC will support transaction advisory on structuring of 
the  PPP  arrangement  under  which  private  operators  would  be  selected. 
Competitive tenders would be used to procure private operators, and the 
bidders  would  be  selected  based  on  technical  eligibility  and  financial 
criteria.  The  financial  criteria  being  the  level  of  tariff  required,  or, 
alternatively,  the  level  of  concessional  support  required.  Since  financial 
closure of projects is a challenge in Bangladesh, advisory work will include 
assisting the implementing agencies in meeting their respective conditions 
precedent  outlined  in  the  contractual  documents  and  facilitating  the 
winning bidder in achieving its conditions precedent so that the financing 
for the project is mobilized. 
PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION TO INITIATING TRANSFORMATION 
4.  Investments in this project will contribute to GOB’s targets to have 1,221 MW of 
utility-scale solar, 48 MW of rooftop solar and 1,370 MW of wind by 2021. Phase 1 
grid-connected  investments  will  establish  that  market  for  grid-scale  RE  in 
Bangladesh. Funds proposed for this project are sufficient to cover up to 200 MW 
of installed utility scale and rooftop solar PV capacity (this is a tentative target and 
will change subject to composition of the resource, e.g. solar vs. wind) supported. 
Funding will be flexible so that wind projects can be added. Specific targets will be 
developed during project preparation. 
IMPLEMENTATION READINESS 
5.  SREDA will be responsible for the coordination of Bangladesh’s SREP Program. As 
the institution established by the GoB to promote renewable energy (and energy 
efficiency)  in  Bangladesh,  SREDA  has  the  functional  authority  needed  to 
coordinate the activities and ensure compliance with monitoring and evaluation 
requirements of the development partners. Components supported by the World 
Bank (including IDA allocation) will be channeled through IDCOL, which has been 
109 
 
 
managing the successful renewable energy program of the World Bank since 2003 
under the RERED program that includes the flagship SHS program.  IDCOL is run by 
professional  management  under  effective  oversight  by  a  competent  Board. 
Following  the  successful  SHS  program,  IDCOL  has  been  replicating  the  public-
private partnership arrangement of the SHS program for renewable energy based 
mini-grids and solar irrigation pumps as well. As a company, IDCOL is able to offer 
market  based  incentive  package  to  its  management  and  staff.  IDCOL  will  be 
responsible  for  day-to-day  management  of  the  component  following  Bank's 
fiduciary guidelines and procedures. It will also be responsible for the monitoring 
of the component's activities and results and submission of quarterly/semi-annual 
reports to SREDA. 
6.  Resource availability for wind and solar was estimated by the Solar Wind Energy 
Resource  Assessment  (SWERA),  completed  by  the  United  Nations  Environment 
Program  (UNEP)  and  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  in  2007.  SWERA, 
however,  does  not  provide  the  micro-scale  mapping  necessary  for  utility-scale 
wind  resource  development,  and  a  more  detailed  wind  resource  assessment  is 
currently underway with support from USAID. Availability of land for roof-top solar 
has been estimated by two existing studies on rooftop space available for solar PV 
in parts of Dhaka and Chittagong; however, these studies are not sufficient for an 
investment-grade estimate of technical potential therefore a detailed assessment 
should take place prior to investment. 
RATIONALE FOR SREP FINANCING 
7.  SREP financing will create enabling environment for grid-connected large scale RE 
applications by supporting detailed resource assessment, which should be ready 
in advance of developing proper PPP arrangements. SREP financing to investment 
in  projects  will  establish  the  bankability  of  RE  projects  within  the  emerging 
regulatory  framework  and  contribute  to  lowering  the  cost  of  electricity.  SREP 
financing  could  help  the  early  projects  mitigate  some  of  the  perceived  risks 
associated  with  first-mover  projects,  which  affect  investor  confidence  and  thus 
limit  the  availability  of  private  sector  financing  for  these  projects.  While  the 
potential returns on investment in utility-scale PV has stimulated interest from few 
developers to date, no project has reached financial close or started construction. 
SREP support will also help lay the ground for leveraging of substantial financing 
from  the  private  sector  for  utility  scale  RE  development  by  helping  the  first 
projects obtain appropriate long-term financing. Successful financial closure and 
development  of  the  first  few  utility-scale  RE  projects  with  support  from  SREP 
should  demonstrate  the  viability  of  RE  technologies  in  the  country,  lowering  of 
tariff  as  market  gets  more  matured  players,  as  well  as  the  soundness  of  the 
regulatory  regime  to  support  them.  SREP  financing  could  be  provided  in 
combination  of  the  partial  risk  guarantees  that  would  be  offered  by  the  World 
Bank,  if  desired  by  private  bidders,  to  reduce  private  investors  risk  related  to 
regulatory changes, or changes in macro-economic variables that are difficult or 
unusually expensive to hedge (currency fluctuation, for example) for government 
and the private sector. 
110 
 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT MITIGATION PLAN 
8.  An environmental and social management framework (ESMF), consistent with the 
requirements  of  the  World  Bank  Group,  will  be  developed  as  part  of  project 
preparation. As part of the RERED program supported by the World Bank, there is 
a  precedence  of  IDCOL  successfully  developing  and  implementing  an  ESMF 
acceptable to the World Bank for the renewable energy program of IDCOL (SHS, 
mini-grids,  solar  irrigation  pumps,  improved  cookstoves,  and  biogas  plants  for 
cooking).    This  ESMF  will  be  the  basis  for  developing  the  ESMF  for  the  SREP 
program. 
RESULTS INDICATORS  
9.  Results  indicators  will  be  determined  during  the  project  preparation  stage. 
Anticipated outcomes of the project include the following: 
  170MW of utility-scale solar/wind generation capacity installed 
  32MW of rooftop solar PV installed 
  increased supply of electricity generated from renewable energy 
  private sector investment leveraged 
  Increased  government  and  private  sector  experience  and  capacity  to 
develop large-scale RE projects 
  GHG emissions reduced or avoided.

LEAD IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES 
10.  The project will be implemented by the World Bank and IFC. The World Bank 
will  support  a  credit  line  or  refinancing  facility  for  the  private  sector  at  the 
government-owned financial intermediary (IDCOL).  Partial risk guarantees would 
be also considered subject to market needs. IFC will undertake a direct investment 
in  grid-connected  RE  or  solar  rooftop  project  and  implement  the  transaction 
advisory  component.  The  timeline  for  the  direct  investment  and  transaction 
advisory  will  depend  upon  the  issuance  of  licensing  and  completion  of  PPA 
negotiations with private developers. 
PROJECT PREPARATION TIMETABLE  
11.  The  World  Bank  will  proceed  with the  component  2 on  resource assessment 
using SREP project preparation grant. The project is expected to be processed for 
World  Bank  approval  in  the  first  quarter  of  calendar  year  2017,  subject  to  the 
progress  of  preparation  activities.  IFC  will  conduct  an  initial  market  assessment 
following  approval  of  the  SREP-Bangladesh  IP.  Depending  on  market  conditions 
and appraisals, it is expected that the project will be submitted to the SREP Sub-
Committee  for  approval  in  the  third  quarter  of  2016  and  presented  to  the  IFC 
Board for approval in the first quarter of 2017. 
PROJECT PREPARATION GRANT 
12.  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  is  requesting  a  project  preparatory  grant  of 
US$0.95 million to undertake site-specific solar resource assessments in support 
of a national resource mapping for solar.

B.2  Off-Grid Solar Photovoltaic 
PROBLEM STATEMENT 
1.  Access  to  modern  energy  services  is  important  in  economic  development  and 
addressing  poverty  reduction.  ADB’s  energy  sector  assessment  of  Bangladesh 
shows  that  the  country’s  demand  for  electricity  growing  at  fast  rate.    The 
government’s “Vision 2021” and Power System Master Plan 2010 aims at achieving 
universal  access  to  grid  connected  electricity  by  2021  with  total  installed 
generating  capacity  of  20,000  MW  by  2020  and  40,00MW  by  2030.  These  are 
ambitious targets but to achieve them, significant investments will be needed in 
both on grid and off-grid power infrastructure. A major effort of the government 
in  addressing  power  shortage  is  to  raise  electricity  coverage—from  47%  of 
households  in  2009  to  74%  in  201576,  with  a  yearly  per-capita  electricity  usage 
reaching  about  321  kWh,  which  is  still  low  compared  to  other  South  Asian 
countries.  The  government    in  recognizing  that  the    sector  challenges  for 
sustainable development is providing secure and high-quality electricity services 
for all by  initiating the 500 MW Solar PV Development .  
 
2.  PV  Pumping  for  Agricultural  Irrigation:  In  Bangladesh  around  80%  of  the 
population earns their livelihood from farming.  Rice constitutes over 90% of the 
country’s  total  food  grain  production  and  about  77%  of  irrigated  land  area  is 
irrigated with ground water. According to statistics from Rural Electrification Board 
(REB),  Bangladesh  Power  Development  Board  (BPDB),  and  Sustainable  and 
Renewable  Energy  Development  Agency  (SREDA),  local  farmers  rely  on  some 
266,000 electrically powered water pumps to irrigate 1.7 million hectares. During 
peak growing season, an additional 1.3 million diesel-run pumps are operated to 
irrigate another 3.4 million hectares consuming about 0.9 million tons of diesel per 
annum,  creating  $280  million  in  subsidies,  while  emitting  more  than  31  million 
tons of CO2 .   The government has set a target for PV pumps of 150 MW by 2021. 
3.  PV  mini-grids:  This  will  mainly  be  implemented  in  remote  areas  where  grid 
expansion is not likely to happen in the next 15-20 years. The government has set 
an installed capacity target for PV mini-grids of 25 MW (the individual mini-grid 
capacity has been assumed to be between 100 kWp and 250 kWp). 
PROJECT OBJECTIVE  
4.  The project will transform lives of rural households through increased access to 
electricity by implementing following 3 components: 
  Component  1:  PV  pumps  for  agricultural  irrigation.  Financing  would  be 
grant  based  to  the  government;  on-lent  to  a  designated  implementing 
agency using financing structures and models available in the market (e.g. 
IDCOL); before being channeled to end-users. 
  Component  2:  PV  mini-grids.  Financing  would  be  grant  based  to  the 
government;  on-lent  to  the  designated  implementing  agencies;  and 
channeled to sponsors or end-users.

  Component 3: Technical assistance for project preparation of components 
1 and 2, including business models; possible participation of private sector; 
related  regulation;  technical  studies  to  diagnose    possible  barriers  and 
issues that may appear during project implementation. 
PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION TO INITIATING TRANSFORMATION   
5.  The  Scaling-up  Renewable  Energy  Program  in  Low  Income  Countries  (SREP) 
financing  will address the gap in the climate finance architecture by ensuring a 
direct assistance in adopting low carbon energy technologies and using renewable 
energy to improve rural energy access. Investments in this project proposal will 
contribute to the government’s global target of implementing 25 MWp of mini-
grid,  and  150  MWp  PV  pump  capacity  under  the  500  MWp  Solar  Development 
Program. The proposed off grid project will provide up to 25 MWp of mini-grids 
(to  be  confirmed  during  project  preparation)  and  6  MWp 77  of  PV  pumping 
capacity 78,  while  contributing  to  the  government’s  goal  in  achieving  universal 
access to electricity by 2020. The mini-grid component has the potential to provide 
75,000 to 100,00079 new electricity connections in more than 150 rural areas. In 
addition, PV pumps can also improve access to electricity by offering use of power 
services during low irrigation season.   
IMPLEMENTATION READINESS 
6.  The  government  has  gained  experience  through  its  extensive  nationwide 
implementation of PV pumping and mini-grids systems, including related business 
models. Both technologies are mature and reliable, however like any other rural 
infrastructure, it will require adequate maintenance systems in place for ensuring 
sustainable operation.  
7.  Compared to conventional diesel motor based pumping and power systems, PV 
pumping and mini-grids are the best low cost supply  options in rural areas, while 
its  application  range  is  constantly  increasing  due  to  price  decreases  and 
improvements of PV generation and pumping technologies. Following advantages 
are key assets for the off-grid projects: (i) use of PV eliminates air pollution, noise 
disturbances,  and  soil  pollution  from  motor  oil  and  fuel  spills;  (ii)  no  fuel 
requirement,  thus  operation  is  independent  of  fuel  availability  and  price 
development issues; (iii) the only practical solution/option in non-electrified areas 
where logistics make it too expensive or even impossible to supply diesel fuel; (iv) 
can be located close to demand centers, thus distribution and transmission losses 
are minimal; and (v) can run automatically and require little O&M (i.e. PV pumps 
can store energy in  tanks, which feeds water by gravity).

RATIONALE FOR SREP FINANCING 
8.  ADB  strongly  supports  Bangladesh  efforts  in  achieving  a  “transformational 
change” towards low carbon development strategies through public and private 
sector investments in the power and energy sectors. The SREP funding will enable 
low carbon energy pathways to be optimized by exploiting indigenous renewable 
energy potential to offset fossil-based energy supply.  In addition, SREP will help 
capturing other co-benefits such as avoid environmental pollution; diffusion of low 
carbon technologies and industries; and improve climate resilience, while reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), where 40% results from energy production and 
use.  
9.  Climate  finance  will  play  a  crucial  role  in  assisting  Bangladesh  in  making  the 
transition to a more environmentally sustainable system of energy production and 
use,  while  also  addressing  development  priorities  of  improving  rural  energy 
access; energy security and poverty.  
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT MITIGATION PLAN 
10.  The comprehensive review and evaluation of PV technologies over the entire 
life cycle has produced a clear picture of their key environmental indicators.  
  The decommissioning of PV modules is seen as an environmental challenge 
for the solar industry. To address this challenge, an international PV industry 
program  that  is  addressing  the  recycling  challenge  in  Europe,  has  been 
established. The first large-scale dismantling facility for end-of-life modules 
was introduced in Europe in 2009 under PV CYCLE; 
  The energy payback period of a PV system has declined to approximately 
one  year.  PV  systems  emit  no  GHGs  or  air  pollutants  during  normal 
operation.  The  material  extraction  and  production  stages  account  for 
almost all emissions in the PV life cycle. The largest concern is associated 
with fluorinated GHG emissions. Recent trends show that releases of these 
gases  are  on  the  decline,  which  may  be  attributed  to  more  efficient 
manufacturing processes and the use of alternative substances.  
  Water use in the life cycle of PV technologies is mainly from upstream usage 
related to manufacturing and is considered to be minimal. No water is used 
during the operation of PV systems, except for when modules are cleaned. 
In addition, the impacts on water quality are considered to be minimal.  
  Ground-mounted  applications  can  have  a  significant,  though  localized, 
impacts on landscape and ecology. As module efficiency increases, land use 
will  decrease.  However,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  when  PV  power 
plants are constructed using best management practices, they can provide 
a positive benefit to biodiversity. Another benefit of PV power plants is that 
they can be located on marginal lands and brownfields. They can also be 
used on higher-quality lands in conjunction with grazing livestock and crops. 
- No social impacts or resettlement are expected

B.3  Waste-to-Energy Advisory Support 
PROBLEM STATEMENT 
1.  Approximately 13,383 tons of solid waste are produced daily in Bangladesh; more 
than 4,379 tons come from Dhaka alone. Despite vast resource potential (in terms 
of daily municipal waste production), the absence of established waste collection 
procedures has acted as a barrier to development of this technology.   
PROJECT OBJECTIVE  
2.  The project consists of transaction advisory to help the GoB identify the technical 
and commercial options for developing a WtE plant. The objective of this project 
is to develop a comprehensive business model for a WtE project that takes into 
account  both  the  technical  and  managerial  challenges  in  Bangladesh.  The  work 
completed  under  the  transaction  advisory  would  include  the  development  of  a 
feasibility  study  and  “business  case”  to  consider  options  for  ownership  and 
operation. Such options would include a purely public arrangement (government 
owned  and  operated);  and  various  types  of  PPP  arrangements  (for  example, 
management contracts, leases, or concessions). 
PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION TO INITIATING RTANSFORMATION   
3.  The GoB’s RE targets for 2021 include 40 MW in waste to power from municipal 
waste. This project would enable investment in future waste-to-energy projects as 
part of Phase 2 of this IP. The WtE model developed in this project could also be 
incorporated  into  future  waste  management  plans  for  Dhaka,  Chittagong,  and 
other major cities. 
IMPLEMENTATION READINESS 
4.  The  advisory  services  would  be  procured  through  the  World  Bank  with  SREDA 
acting as the client. SREDA regularly works with advisors as part of various MDB 
projects, including preparation of the SREP IP.  
RATIONALE FOR SREP FINANCING 
5.  The GoB has shown great interest in developing a WtE plant.  Previous attempts 
have  failed  due  to  the  technical  issues  related  to  waste  collection.  SREP  funds 
would be used to develop a business model that take into account the inherent 
challenges of building the first WtE plant in Bangladesh. 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT MITIGATION PLAN 
6.  There are no environmental or social impacts anticipated as a result of this project.  
RESULTS INDICATORS 
7.  The  project  will  result  in  the  identification  of  a  business  model  to  be  used  for 
building  a WtE plant.  Additional  indicators  may be  identified during  the project 
preparation process.

Appendix C: Stakeholder Consultations 
Bangladesh’s SREP Investment Plan is the result of an extensive internal and public 
consultation process, led by the Government of Bangladesh and represented by the 
Sustainable Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) to identify priorities 
in the development of renewable energy technologies. The consultations included a 
broad  range  of  government  agencies,  as  well  as  representatives  from  the  private 
sector,  civil  society organizations  (CSOs)  and donors.  Feedback  was  sought  through 
one-on-one meetings and group workshops with stakeholders. 
Scoping Mission 
A World Bank Group and Asian Development Bank team Joint SREP Scoping mission 
took place between January 26 and 28, 2015. Participants in the stakeholder meeting 
included representatives from: Power Division; SREDA; Economic Relations Division of 
the  Ministry  of  Finance;  Infrastructure  Development  Company  Limited;  USAID; 
Department  for 
International 
Cooperation Agency (JICA).  
International  Development  (DFID);  and  Japan 
Inception and Data Collection Phase (April 2015) 
The  inception  phase  of  the  project  took  place  in  April  2015.  As  part  of  this  phase 
members of SREDA’s consultant team collected any readily available data and studies 
on renewable energy technology in Bangladesh. Datasets on resource availability for 
wind  and  solar  were  collected  from  the  Solar  Wind  Energy  Resource  Assessment 
(SWERA)  that  had  been  completed  by  the  United  Nations  Environment  Program 
(UNEP)  and  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  in  2007.  Other  information  on 
renewable  energy  projects  was  found  in  academic  papers  and  reports  from  donor 
banks, power companies, and local financial institutions.    
As  a  next  step,  members  of  the  consultant  team  met  with  stakeholders  to  gather 
anecdotal information and any additional studies on ongoing and proposed renewable 
energy projects. A list of the organizations and agencies contacted by the consultants 
is presented in Appendix Table C.1.

First Technical Mission (May-June 2015) 
The purpose of the first technical mission was to solicit feedback from stakeholders 
on  the  technical  and  financial  evaluations  completed  for  the  draft  IP.  The  mission 
included discussions between SREDA, its consultants, the MDB team working on SREP, 
and other key stakeholders. 
The  analytical  work  completed  in  preparing  the  IP  included  a  comprehensive 
assessment  of  renewable  energy  technologies  identified  during  the  data  collection 
phase. The technologies included: solar parks, rooftop solar, solar home systems, wind 
parks,  biomass  for  electricity,  biogas  for  electricity,  small  hydropower,  microgrids, 
solar irrigation, geothermal, and improved clean cook stoves. 
The mission included an open stakeholder consultation workshop to get feedback on 
the analysis. This was held by SREDA on June 8, 2015 and included representatives 
from the government, utility companies, civil society organizations, private sector, and 
donor  organizations  (see  Appendix  Table  C.2).  SREDA  opened  the  workshop  by 
discussing ongoing projects and Government plans for renewable energy investment. 
Recent work highlighted included a PPA agreement for utility-scale solar and a study 
on biomass for electricity. The SREDA representative then discussed the Government’s 
500 MW solar target for 2015 and another plan to install 3,016 MWs of RE capacity by 
2021, in order to achieve the goal of 10 percent generation from renewable resources. 
SREDA outlined three models to be used for procuring utility-scale wind and solar: (1) 
Public Land + Public Ownership; (2) Public land + Private Ownership; and (3) Private 
land  +  Private  Ownership.  SREDA  discussed  the  Government’s  plan  to  have  project 
121 
 
 
developers operate for 20 years with a tariff to cover the levelized cost.  SREDA noted 
that  technical  and  economic  consideration  will  be  needed  if  the  company  has  the 
capability to carry out the project.

Another goal of this mission was to get feedback on the set of criteria to be used to 
evaluate and prioritize projects for the IP. During the stakeholder meeting participants 
123 
 
 
were  asked  to  complete  a  survey  in  which  they  ranked  various  National  and  SREP 
criteria in order of importance. The results of the survey indicated that the 
Second Technical Mission (July 2015) 
An MDB team consisting of the World Bank, International Finance Corporation (IFC), 
and Asian Development Bank (ADB) visited Bangladesh in the period July 27-30, 2015 
to conduct a Joint Mission. The main objectives were (a) to discuss progress on the 
preparation  of  the  SREP  Investment  Plan  (IP)  with  the  Government  and  the  main 
stakeholders; (b) to discuss with the Government and agree on the prioritization of 
renewable energy projects to be supported under the SREP; and (c) to agree on the 
next steps and the timetable to finalize the investment plan and to submit it to the 
SREP Sub-Committee for approval in November 2015.  
As part of the mission SREDA and the Government agreed with the key stakeholders 
and the MDB team on a set of criteria for prioritization of renewable technologies. 
Based  on  the  agreed  upon  priorities,  the  Government  identified  the  following 
renewable  energy  technologies  to  be  supported  with  a  combination  of  SREP  funds 
(subject to approval of SREP IP), public financing, and private sector investments: i) 
utility-scale solar PV and wind; ii) grid-connected solar rooftop; iii) solar irrigation; iv) 
solar/hybrid  mini-grids,  and  v)  waste-to-energy  development  support.  The 
Government  also  agreed  to  include  in  the  IP  a  broader  set  of  renewable  energy 
priorities to help access other sources of climate finance, such as the Green Climate 
Fund (GCF). These included utility-scale wind and other renewable energy, scaling up 
solar  irrigation,  biogas  for  household  and  commercial  use,  scaling  up  improved 
cookstoves, waste-to-energy investment, and grid integration of renewable energy. 
In addition, SREDA and its consultants held two workshops to solicit feedback from 
stakeholders  on  substantive  portions  of  the  draft  IP,  which  had  been  circulated  in 
advance. First, a briefing for the MDB team and representatives from KfW, GiZ, USAID, 
DFID,  and  UNDP  was  held  on  July  28,  2015.  Second,  a  workshop  was  held  for 
representatives  of  private  sector,  civil  society  organizations  (CSOs),  research 
institutions and academia (see Appendix Table C.4) on July 29, 2015.

Appendix E: Comments from Independent Technical 
Reviewer 
Appendix Table E.1 below presents the comments received from the independent technical 
review of the IP and the IP team’s response to each comment.  
Appendix Table E.1: Technical Review Response Matrix  
Comments

Agreed. A section on with additional details on 
implementation arrangements has been added. 
It is surprising that, apart from the very 
successful solar home PV installation program, 
to date the IP suggests that there have been 
relatively few renewable installations. This lack 
of progress raises some concerns as to how 
achievable the targets proposed within the IP 
will be.  A request has been made that the final 
draft of the IP elaborate on the planned 
implementation of the various projects to 
provide some reassurance that the capacity and 
resources are in place to justify the approval of 
funding at the level requested. 
 
It is also important to note that, whereas there 
have been relatively few renewable 
installations, there have been many thermal 
power stations, under both traditional public 
procurement and IPP modalities. 
The filters are very conservative because of the 
scarcity of land in Bangladesh. Technical 
potential was limited to 2% of land shown 
through GIS mapping to be available. This 2% 
limit or “filter” was applied, instead of 1% or 
3%, so as to show a technical potential roughly 
consistent with Government targets. 
For both solar and wind developments an 
assessment is undertaken on actual potential. 
An approach that limits land for grid connected 
solar parks to government owned or non-arable 
land suggests that this might limit the potential 
substantially; on an available land area basis it is 
suggested that only some 2000 MW of PV is 
likely if this limit were applied.  This implies that 
without substantial expansion beyond these 
areas, the 2021 PV target might approach this 
limit. 
 
We have now tried to make this clearer in the 
text. 
 
 
Government plans will of course be adjusted 
over time as Bangladesh achieves better clarity 
on the true technical potential of solar and 
wind. 
Wind power projections on a similar basis, 
limiting installations to land areas where 
flooding is not an issue, suggest an optimistic 
total of less than 1000 MW. 
 
 
It is important that there be a reconciliation 
between these (imposed) limits and the plans 
that the GoB is promoting.  Clearly land access, 
flooding considerations and competing uses are 
of key concern and will no doubt have a strong 
impact on the rate and volume of PV and wind 
installations that can be achieved. 
It also needs to be recognized that while the 
SHS and solar parks use the same fundamental 
PV technology, there are significant differences 
in scale, investment, power sales agreements, 
This is a fair point, but as noted above, 
Bangladesh has extensive experience with large 
scale thermal power stations, both publicly-
owned and IPPs.

operations and maintenance and underlying 
risks in developing and operating large scale grid 
connected PV installations. 
 
Moreover, the benefit of SREP involvement is 
that the IFIs involved can actively help 
Bangladesh work through the challenges 
associated with these new technologies as they 
procure them. 
 
As a final note, the scale of the grid-connected 
installations proposed for SREP-funding are 
small relative to the size of the power sector 
within Bangladesh. These would be modestly 
sized first-projects only, not a major roll-out of 
new plants. 
 
As planning proceeds for projects under the IP / 
SREP, it will be important that the effective 
integration of any projects within the national 
energy plans is clear before final commitments 
to their implementation.  Part of the IP’s 
justification for SREP support is that the 
proposed projects will assist as practical 
demonstrations of what could be achieved with 
wider support from the private sector (and 
other funders). This assumption should be 
revisited as each project is better defined. 
The overall investment proposal that the SREP 
funds will help seed makes assumptions about 
significant additional investments that will be 
secured through MDBs and the private sector. 
Confirmation of the commitment from these 
sources should be a key element in making a 
final decision on the provision of funds under 
SREP. 
Agreed. SREDA’s involvement, as the main 
coordinating entity for the SREP IP ensures that 
project funded under SREP will be tightly 
integrated into national energy plans.  
 
And, as the reviewer suggests, the assumptions 
behind the IP will be revisited during each 
project’s preparation, and checked for 
consistency with SREP criteria for support. 
As noted earlier, the reliance of the overall plan 
on significant co-funding from MDBs and the 
private sector needs to be tested thoroughly to 
ensure that commitments are in place before 
SREP funds are released. There is complexity in 
funding with blended financing, offering partial 
risk guarantees and using PPPs and this should 
not be underestimated as its resolution will 
impact on project execution timelines 
Agreed, the arrangements for financing will be 
clarified, and adjusted, as necessary, during 
each project’s preparation, with extensive 
assistance anticipated from IFIs in deciding on 
the proper financing modalities.  
It may be of value to review the role that the 
SREP funds would play in expanding the off-grid 
PV activities – mini-grids and solar irrigation; are 
these areas where the existing skills within the 
private sector could play a leading role, building 
national capability on the back of the SHS 
Agreed. The private sector, can and does play a 
role in mini-grid and solar irrigation 
technologies. We will make their roles clearer in 
the IP.

experience?  It is noted in the IP that for mini-
grids “IDCOL has a program for micro and mini-
grids but existing projects have run into 
regulatory and operational problems but that 
IDCOL has a pipeline of 21 projects with investor 
interest”. The impact of this situation on 
implementation needs clarification. 
As for the problems IDCOL has experienced with 
such projects, we now highlighted in the draft 
what these problems have been and how we 
anticipate they will be mitigated (see Section 8 
on Implementation Assessment and Risk 
Potential). They are mostly related to areas 
where grid extensions reach areas served by 
mini-/micro-grids or where customers perceive 
that grid connections are imminent. IDCOL and 
SREDA are working with the Ministry of Power, 
Energy and Natural Resources and BPDB to 
achieve better regulatory clarity on this issue in 
a way that will avoid stranding mini-/micro-grid 
assets or dissuading off-grid customers from 
participating in mini-/micro-grid arrangements. 
Catalyze increased investments in renewable 
energy:   
It is useful to view the investment targets in the 
IP in i) the context of the size of Bangladesh’s 
power sector relative to other countries funded 
by SREP and in ii) the level of private sector 
activity in Bangladesh’s power sector. 
Bangladesh is potentially the largest country to 
receive SREP funds in terms of both population 
and GDP. It is nearly the double the largest 
economy (Kenya) to receive SREP funds and its 
population is 64 percent larger than the second 
largest SREP country (Ethiopia). Unsurprisingly, 
the larger economy and population also result in 
Bangladesh having a peak demand 4.5 times 
greater than any other country that has 
previously receive SREP funds (Ghana).    
 
The plan outlines how it is anticipated that SREP 
investments and program support will help 
attract other donor and private funding.  As 
noted this is an aggressive plan with SREP 
funding the basis for what is anticipated would 
see significant leverage of other funds.  This has 
yet to be clearly demonstrated as achievable. 
There does however appear to be a reasonable 
level of private sector interest and capability. 
 
Taking these numbers into context the 
anticipated leverage in funds seems in line with 
a power system of this size combined with the 
significant technical potential. The leverage 
anticipated could actually be considered 
conservative given that SREP plans in Honduras, 
Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania had higher 
anticipated leverage from SREP funds. It is also 
important to consider that the private sector 
has already played a major role in off-grid RE 
investments in Bangladesh. A similar private 
sector market for grid-connected projects is 
anticipated to arise once the first demonstration 
projects come online.  
Enabling environment  
Agreed. SREDA will, in cooperation with the IFIs, 
closely monitor the roles of the implementing 
agencies and, as necessary, change course.

The IP acknowledges that there are a number of 
unaddressed hurdles to renewable 
implementation; there are strategies and an 
allocation of responsibilities to particular 
agencies to address these. Without prior 
engagement with these agencies it is hard to 
assess whether these tasks can reasonably 
achieved by these entities.  This process will 
require close monitoring as the success in 
establishing a sound enabling environment will 
be a key control on the value of the SREP 
investments. 
 
However, it is important to note that the main 
implementing agency for most of the project 
components will likely be IDCOL, which has an 
excellent track record implementing renewable 
energy projects.  
Increase energy access:   
The SREP IP has a balance of grid-connected and 
off-grid energy projects, to reflect the fact that, 
though BPDB is aggressively extending the grid, 
some areas of Bangladesh will for many years 
continue without grid-connected supply. 
 
The need for increased access to energy is clear.  
The SREP support will help accelerate this in 
some areas but is also being targeted at grid 
connected supply which generally may have 
limited impact on improving access at an 
individual level. Mention is made of SREP funds 
being used to reduce cost / increase 
affordability; use of funds for these purposes 
needs to be judicious to ensure that any 
subsidies, their impacts and eventual 
withdrawal are carefully considered. 
 
On the use of SREP funds to reduce 
cost/increase affordability, agreed. IDCOL tracks 
the level of private sector involvement in 
various types of projects and technologies and 
adjusts the level of capital subsidies accordingly. 
For example, subsidies for solar home systems 
are expected to be phased-out in the coming 
years, given the extent of unsubsidized private 
sector involvement outside of IDCOL’s 
programs. 
Implementation capacity:   
Agreed, we have included a section on 
implementing arrangements in the revised 
draft. 
 
It is understood that IDCOL will be the 
implementing agency for the grid connected 
program.  They have successfully overseen the 
off-grid work but as noted the grid 
interconnection of renewables brings a number 
of fresh challenges. The IP authors have agreed 
to define in a limited way the intentions around 
implementation and the capacity of those 
nominated entities.  This area needs close 
consideration; the ability to effectively plan and 
management project implementation and 
ensure timely utilization of funds is critical. 
Improve the long-term economic viability of the 
renewable energy sector:   
Agreed. Please see our response to the 
comment above regarding subsidies. 
 
The renewable energy sector in Bangladesh has 
been largely focused on off grid SHS activities.

that have been engaged in the domestic PV 
market and these notes are encouraging.  
Clearly there are still policy and regulatory 
issues that need resolution; a number of 
“stalled” projects are noted but attention 
appears to be directed at resolving the issues 
that they are facing.  Given the indicated 
limitations on land for large scale PV and wind 
developments, it is clear that the contribution 
that renewables will make is important but only 
part of the solution. 
 
It is often suggested that  SREP funded activities 
will drive a more focused and sustainable basis 
for future growth; there needs to be increased 
private sector engagement and this will only 
occur, on a sustained basis, when regulatory 
and pricing signals are clear and acceptable to 
the market.  SREP funds must therefore be 
directed into projects where conditions are 
conducive to ensuring such outcomes. As noted, 
care must be taken to avoid inappropriate 
subsidies that cause market distortions 
Transformative impact:   
The value of SREP support comes not just from 
the funding and “demonstration effect”, but 
also through the involvement in IFIs in providing 
TA which supports high quality transactions and 
sustainable commercial models. The models 
developed by IDCOL for off-grid projects have 
already been proven. The World Bank and IFC 
will work with Government to ensure that these 
first grid-connected projects funded by SREP will 
be prepared in such a way that they are 
replicable. 
 
The targeted nature of the proposed SREP 
investments in Bangladesh is seen as pragmatic 
given the current energy market status, limited 
electricity access and a need to enhance the 
enabling environment.  Given the renewable 
sector is relatively immature it is not to be 
expected that there will be major 
transformations in the market through SREP 
alone but if well managed and executed the 
proposed program should help  further develop 
the wider renewable energy sector in the 
country. Experience suggests that 
demonstration projects with specialist funding, 
such as SREP, will not necessarily ensure that an 
attractive commercial market place results 
quickly. 
Agreed. 
The Investment Proposal in itself is thorough 
and comprehensive.  With a concern over the 
depletion of gas reserves, the solar and wind 
options appear to offer acceptably priced 
options for generation. A grid connected focus is 
perhaps the preferred option in terms of 
helping grow the renewables contribution as

rapidly as possible; the success of the SHS 
program must continue to address the question 
of broader access to energy for those located 
away from existing grid networks 
The attraction of the private sector into grid 
connected projects is recognized as challenging 
but part of the SREP program will be to test the 
practicality of PPP projects and this experience 
can only be of value in determining the best 
models for future expansion of the energy 
sector. 
Agreed. Please see our response to the 
comment regarding subsidies, above. 
 
Off grid activities, beyond the SHS work, may be 
more immediately attractive to the private 
sector and care should be taken to ensure that 
the availability of SREP funds does not 
discourage this participation 
Generic cost analysis for various technologies 
supports their consideration; more thorough 
business plans for each project should however 
be prepared in due course to ensure that the 
individual aspects of each are adequately 
considered to ensure commercial viability. 
Agreed. More detailed business plans will be 
prepared as part of each project’s preparation.
