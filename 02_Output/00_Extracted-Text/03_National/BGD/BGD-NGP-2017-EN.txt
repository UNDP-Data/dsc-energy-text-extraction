1.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This executive summary follows the outline of the report by first outlining the demand projections 
and quantifying the unmet demand. Secondly, this executive summary summarises the findings 
from the domestic gas supply/production analysis, which shows that any significant increase in 
domestic production is not likely to materialise within the next 6-8 years. In conclusion, and not 
surprisingly, in each and every scenario there is a need for importing gas to Bangladesh both 
through LNG and pipeline. Due to the geography of Bangladesh however, the locational options 
for importing LNG are restricted to the south-eastern part of the country at Moheshkhali. Bringing 
gas from the south to the north, instead of the other way around, requires new investments in 
the gas transmission system. The executive summary presents main features and conclusions 
from the analysis of the performance of the transmission system resulting from the derived 
future demand and supply situation. Finally, the summary presents suggestions to the legal and 
regulatory framework, changes which would support a positive development in domestic gas 
production, facilitation of LNG imports, and a sustainable development of the transmission 
system.              
 
Demand for gas in Bangladesh – large unmet demand  
During the last decade, the gas production and consumption has doubled to 2,750 MMCFD. The 
demand is even higher as there is a large unmet demand and need for curtailment of supply. Our 
analyses in the GSMP 2017 show that it is likely that demand will continue to grow, depending on 
scenarios and use of other fuels like coal and renewable. In the GSMP 2017, we have analysed 
three scenarios; A: base scenario (similar to PSMP2016) with focus on self-sufficiency and hereby 
introduction of coal on large scale, B: a high growth, international oriented scenario with focus on 
gas, and C: climate scenario, where climate change renewable energy supplement use of gas on 
large scale. In order to maintain the flexibility and based on comments received during and after 
the stakeholder workshop, we use Scenario C as our basis for the further analysis.

Supply of gas – indigenous resources, LNG and pipeline gas imports 
The current indigenous gas production in Bangladesh is 2,754 MMCFD. The production level from 
existing discoveries is expected to start declining quickly in the next few years. However, the 
majority of geological areas in the country is still unexplored. The Gas Sector Master Plan 
Consultants (hereafter the Consultants) believe that there are still large upsides in the indigenous 
production in Bangladesh if further exploration successes can be achieved. See charts below.

The Consultants believe that, even at P90 level, the Yet-to-Find (YTF) resources in Bangladesh is 
as large as 34 tcf – a significant volume that could almost double Bangladesh’s current 
production level if all geological areas are to be explored and developed properly. This in turn will 
reduce the total cost of gas to Bangladesh, hence the financial burden for the country would be 
significantly reduced comparing to paying higher prices for imported gas. 
 
For example, we estimate that, in a USD 60/bbl global long-term oil price environment, the net 
cost of indigenous gas production in Bangladesh ranges from USD0.9 to USD5.4/mcf. This is 
lower than potential imported gas from Myanmar USD 5 to USD 6/mcf, LNG from the spot market 
(in the next few years only) USD 5 to USD 7/mcf, and long-term contracted LNG USD 9 to USD 
10/mcf, see Figure 3 below.

In order to capture this significant production potential in Bangladesh, rigorous exploration and 
development programmes as well as adequate resources and time are required. 
 
Firstly, additional gas can be extracted from thin-bed resources as well as deeper prospects so 
that gas can easily be tied-in to existing infrastructure for early production. 
 
BAPEX has already planned to drill a large number of exploration wells within the next few years. 
The Consultants understand the urgency of such exploration programme in order to make quick 
discoveries and sustain current production level. However, we recommend Bangladesh to allow 
itself more time for in-depth and structured G&G preparatory work, as this will improve both the 
likelihood and the size of the discoveries. 
 
As large geological areas in Bangladesh remain unexplored, we recommend a systematic and risk 
based approach for Bangladesh’s exploration and development programmes in order to best 
utilise its resources. Priorities should be given to better known areas (eastern Bangladesh) and 
then gradually move to more frontier areas (western Bangladesh). 
 
As the future E&P of indigenous gas becomes increasingly larger and challenging, it requires 
systematic capacity building and the strengthening of human resources in Petrobangla and its 
subsidiaries. We recommend relevant authorities to give adequate managerial and financial 
support for such development.  
 
We also recommend Bangladesh to invest in multi-client and open seismic surveys in preparation 
for future bidding rounds. Gas prospects in Bangladesh can be made more attractive to 
international applicants when processed and open data packages are made available.

We understand that Petrobangla and relevant authorities have been adjusting its upstream fiscal 
regimes in order to attract IOCs for Bangladesh’s offshore blocks. We support such adjustments 
and believe further engagements with IOCs are a key to unlock these technically challenging 
resources in offshore areas.  
 
From a financial prospective, it could still be rewarding for Bangladesh to invest more in its 
indigenous gas potentials, if there are not enough IOC investments. Looking at this in context, if 
long-term contracted LNG costs Bangladesh around USD10/mmbtu at ex-regasification terminal, 
the purchase of LNG at 800mmcf/d (0.3tcf/yr) will cost over USD3 billion for a single year. Such 
amount of money could be used to finance large exploration and development programmes both 
onshore and offshore, where significant yet-to-find potentials are expected.  
  
In short, we believe that there is still significant potential in Bangladesh’s indigenous gas 
production, and it should be given high importance and explored properly. The scale of future 
E&P success will determine the level of gas required from foreign sources, through LNG and 
pipeline gas.

Bangladesh has already taken some very encouraging steps in increasing gas supply through LNG 
imports. Two FSRUs namely Excelerate and Summit are scheduled to be in operation in mid- 
2018 and end 2018 respectively, while future LNG receiving terminals are under consideration. At 
the time of writing, Bangladesh is in an advanced stage of negotiating an LNG contract with 
Qatar.  
 
The GSMP Consultant supports Bangladesh’s decision in purchasing significant volumes of LNG, 
and recommends further import capacity through both connections to existing India LNG 
terminals and a third LNG terminal in Bangladesh within the next few years in order to satisfy the 
unmet demand for gas in the country. 
 
Often, long-term LNG contracts to Asia are linked to oil price, while the spot LNG price is likely to 
be kept low up to 2020 due to the oversupply situation in the global market; hence, spot LNG is 
likely to offer more competitive prices during this period. Therefore, the Consultants recommend 
  
 
  
5 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bangladesh to import maximum quantity of LNG as its infrastructure allows, with majority of the 
LNG to be purchased from the spot market while small quantity from long-term contracts, 
creating a price and risk adjusted portfolio.   
 
However, the oversupply situation in the global LNG market may start to change after 2020, 
which in turn affects the price differentials in spot LNG and long-term contracted LNG. The 
Consultants therefore recommend Bangladesh to keep fine tuning the balance of its LNG portfolio 
to minimise its spending. Bangladesh can also consider entering joint LNG purchase contracts 
with its neighbour countries (e.g. India) in order to strengthen its negotiation power on LNG 
prices. 
 
Meanwhile, the need for LNG in the longer term is inherently uncertain, and the scale of LNG 
requirement will largely depend on the outcome of the exploration of indigenous gas resources in 
Bangladesh as well as the availability of pipeline gas from foreign countries, e.g. Myanmar, 
Turkmenistan and Iran. Therefore, the Consultants recommend that Bangladesh’s gas supply mix 
strategy and consequently infrastructure plan to be reviewed and adjusted periodically in 
response to the evolving conditions. 
 
Albeit a challenging task, the Consultants strongly recommend Petrobangla and relevant 
Bangladesh authorities to pursuit pipeline gas from foreign countries mentioned above. The 
success of such pursuit will not only enhance the security of supply for Bangladesh, but also bring 
down the overall cost of gas imports and strengthen Bangladesh’s negotiation power in the 
international market. It also needs to be mentioned that there are strong competitions for the 
said pipeline gas, especially gas from Myanmar. Petrobangla and relevant Bangladesh authorities 
are therefore strongly recommended to (re)start the dialogs swiftly. 
 
Bangladesh can also consider acquiring interests in projects from where it imports its gas as 
favourable acquisition costs can be achieved under the current oil price. This could also help to 
hedge against possible high oil and LNG prices in the future, as Bangladesh would be buying gas 
from its own oversea assets. 
 
Transmission infrastructure – investments in large 
diameter pipelines needed flow gas from south to 
north.   
The gas transmission system in Bangladesh will need to 
change to accommodate the increase in demand and the 
need for imports. Specifically, the flow direction which is 
currently from the North to the South will need to change 
as most of the new supplies, LNG, offshore production; 
connection with Myanmar will be brought in from the south.

The current gas transmission system1 has been modelled in Pipeline Studio investigating the 
ability to deliver gas to the 6 franchise areas of the country. The modelling was done for the 
years 2021 (short term) and 2031 (medium term).  
 
In the short term, the demand for gas is expected to increase moderately in all franchise areas. 
In the medium term, 14 years from today (2017), a large increase in gas demand is expected. 
The developments in the franchise areas are presented below in Figure 5.

SHORT TERM (2021) TRANSMISSION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENTS – FOCUS ON CONNECTION TO 
INDIA 
The first key finding in the short term is that with the transmission system as 2021 there will be 
challenges in meeting demand with a potential short fall of around 500 MMCFD. Theoretically, 
this shortfall could be spread out over the entire country; however, realistically, the shortfall in 
gas will be felt mostly at the end of the transmission system specifically in Khulna in the 
Sundarban region, as gas either from the south east or from the north east would have to be 
transported across the country to reach the west. If this area is prioritised at the expense of 
another area, the Elenga compressor station would have to be turned on. The best solution for 
resolving the potential shortfall in volumes and corresponding transmission capacity has been 
identified and comprises of a pipeline from India (connection at Khulna), an additional 3rd LNG 
terminal in south east at Moheshkhali and a large onshore pipeline connection Moheshkhali to the 
west of the country via a system loop with pipelines from Langlband to Khulna.

and Table 25  
  
 
  
7 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
The GSMP Consultant recommends the pipeline from India to Khulna as this connection will 
increase system stability, security of supply, and strengthen the bargaining position of 
Bangladesh towards external suppliers. Given the supply and demand situation in 2021, we 
recommend a third LNG terminal at Moheshkhali which will trigger a need for additional 
transmission capacity from Moheshkhali. It can be argued whether this should be an offshore or 
onshore pipeline solution. Ideally, from a technical perspective, we would recommend the 
offshore pipeline; however, this will take more time to plan and execute. It is also most likely 
that the onshore pipeline can be completed in the short term, and therefore given the urgency 
required for meeting the short-term demand capacity, it is recommended to pursue the onshore 
solution first. The onshore solution also has the advantage that it can be built in sections and that 
investment money largely stays within the country. However, the offshore pipeline is still to be 
required in the mid/long term strategy, hence it is recommended to start feasibility studies 
immediately for this.

The second key finding of the short-term modelling is that if the India connection is not built, 
more volumes and capacity are needed, which will need to come from the south east at 
Moheshkhali with a 4th LNG terminal (triggered by the additional volumes). With the current plans 
for LNG the 4th terminal is likely to be a land based terminal – in that case reaching completion 
by 2021 will be difficult. Alternatively, the volumes could be secured by connecting the 
transmission system with Myanmar (also from the south east); however, we also doubt this can 
realistically be achieved by 2021. In any case, (Myanmar or a 4th LNG) the transmission capacity 
would need to be expanded.   
 
 
 
  
 
  
8 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
System optimisation and usage of existing compressor stations 
Finally, depending on the exact delivery demands and supply locations, it may be beneficial to 
lower the pressure at Ashuganj/Muchai compressor station in order to help the gas flow from the 
south east of the country to the west. A more detailed study is required to definitively determine 
this. 
 
Prepare the system for future growth – exploit economies of scale 
It will be essential for the supply of gas to the west that the 30” x 45 km pipeline Kutumbopur – 
Meghnaghat and the 30” x 140 km Langolbad – Gopalgonj pipelines are constructed. We 
recommend a higher capacity of the pipelines (36”) to accommodate future growth in gas 
demand. We would also recommend connecting Gopalgonj and Khulna to complete the first step 
of the transmission backbone also creating a system loop. The connection would serve as an 
important part of the major transmission backbone of the country and facilitate further 
expansions and connections of power plants. Without these investments, the ELENGA compressor 
must be turned on to supply the west of the country with 500 MMCFD. 
 
Looking at demand post 2021, it quickly becomes evident that the pipelines suggested by GTCL 
are undersized to carry the volume further in the system. Thus, at this stage, we recommend 
installing larger dimensions pipelines to accommodate future demand. Of course, for pipelines 
where materials have already been purchased or even installed this might prove to be a 
challenge. In these cases, we suggest to carry on as is.  
 
Short term gas transmission network development – 2021 
Based on the pipeline studio modelling combined with the need for gas transmission in the long 
term, the Consultants’ recommendations for the short-term network development will be the 
following pipelines and compressor stations in addition to the projects already under 
construction.

MEDIUM TERM (2031) TRANSMISSION SYSTEM MODELLING – SURGE IN DEMAND REQUIRES 
COMPLETION OF THE MAJOR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM BACKBONE 
The medium term (2031) has been modelled building upon the infrastructure included in the 
short term and the connection to India at Khulna. In between 2021 and 2031, we project an 
increase in demand from approximately 4500 MMCFD to just above 6500 MMCFD. On the 
domestic supply side, we would expect that some E&P results have been achieved between 2021 
and 2031 increasing the domestic production from 3000 MMCFD to 4800 MMCFD; however, these 
are uncertain figures and do of course rely on following the recommendations on the E&P. The 
import capacity has been set to allow up to 500 MMCFD from India (connection at Khulna). From 
the south east, we allow up to 2000 MMCFD. We do, however, on purpose not specify the source 
of the volumes from the south east as these can be achieved from either additional LNG, from 
Myanmar or from offshore domestic production. Time will show how these sources develop in 
feasibility and we find that keeping the flexibility to adjust is important and prudent.  
  
Large scale transmission capacity from Moheshkhali onshore and offshore required to 
facilitate import    
Regardless of the source of the gas volumes from the south east, we find that in order to meet 
the gas demand in the Titas, Pashchimanchal and Sundarban regions, the following projects must 
be completed: 
 
Offshore Pipeline between Moheshkhali and the “Langolbad – Gopalgonj/Khulna pipeline” 
We recommend a 36” x 150 km offshore pipeline and a 42” x 150 onshore between Moheshkhali 
and the Langolbad – Gopalgonj/Khulna pipeline. The actual routing of the pipeline will have to be 
adjusted to connection points to power plants and other large consumers as well as to right-of-
way and environmental constraints. The connection will apart from evacuating the gas form south 
east at Moheshkhali, strengthen security of supply not only in the western part of the country but 
in fact help the entire country as dependence on the narrow onshore corridor is reduced. To 
facilitate the transport further in the system, it is necessary that the diameter of the connecting 
Langolbad – Gopalgonj/Khulna pipeline is 36”.

Hatikumrul - Langolbad – Gopalgonj/Khulna pipelines 
As part of the backbone from south east to north west, we recommend that the offshore pipeline 
is continued (36” x 120 km) further to Hatikumrul in the north-western part of the country. The 
routing should preferably follow the existing transmission system. Finally, one intermediate 
compressor station is potentially required between Moheshkhali and Dhaka. A detailed study is 
required to definitively determine this.   
 
Medium term gas transmission network development 
The investments in the medium term will depend on the actual development of the indigenous 
gas production. However, in all cases, we foresee the need to strengthen the gas supply from the 
LNG import facilities and/or Myanmar, which is the nearest country with surplus gas production.  
 
Based on the pipeline studio modelling combined with the view of long term use of the gas 
transmission, the following investments are proposed. The actual of implementation will need to 
be adjusted as the market develops. Also, we have an underground gas storage in the period to 
allow for market integration and system balance. This can facilitate import of gas but also ensure 
security of gas supply, a better utilisation of LNG terminals and possible transit of gas from 
Myanmar to India.

LONG TERM (2041) TRANSMISSION SYSTEM MODELLING – UNCERTAINTY AHEAD FOCUS ON 
FLEXIBILITY AND KEEPING OPTIONS OPEN 
The situation in 2041 has so much uncertainty about the actual gas production, import via LNG 
and pipelines, as well as the actual location of gas consumption. Therefore, the GSMP Consultant 
has decided not to further attempt to get the model to converge for this year but instead 
envisions the design of a flexible system, which will be able to adapt to most of the uncertainty 
by creating a strong backbone of the gas transmission system from the LNG import terminals, 
south of Dhaka and further to the Western part of the country.  
 
As the import of gas supply increases, the indigenous gas production will increasingly be used 
close to the gas production or cease to exist in 2041. This situation may result in an operation 
where the pressure in the system close to production can be some lowered and perhaps even the 
flows reversed. Further to the gas transportation, a system with large diameter pipelines will also 
be able to provide additional line pack flexibility to ensure gas demand variations during the day. 
To further increase flexibility and as back up for LNG supply in case of severe weather conditions, 
the Consultants also recommend converting an existing gas field to underground gas storage.

Post 2031, the GSMP Consultant estimates that there could be possibilities to get 
Turkmen/Iranian gas if the TAPI pipeline is constructed. Thus, an additional connection to India 
at Rangpur in the north is envisaged. The connection should also enable bidirectional flow 
allowing potential excess production from Myanmar to transit through Bangladesh to India. The 
length of the backbone from the Myanmar to the Indian border is approx. 500 km. It is 
recommended to develop this as a large diameter pipeline, even if such diameter is only required 
in the longer term to avoid investing in small diameter pipelines.  
 
In general, the system in Bangladesh has so short pipelines that intermediate compression is 
only necessary in few cases to ensure sufficient flow.  
  One intermediate compressor station between Moheshkhali and Dhaka – location suggested 
at Feni 
  Compressor station could be combined with offshore underground gas storage Sangu field – 
the feasibility of this should of course be investigated before any decision, to date we are not 
aware of any relevant studies. 
  Border station Myanmar 
  Border station India (Khulna) 
  Gas field compression – in particular when fields are being depleted 
 
In addition to line compressor stations, there may be need for field compressor stations when the 
production pressure becomes lower than the needed pipeline pressure. By using increased 
                                               
2 The map shows the general envisioned back bone required for the long term plan of the network. Exact sizes and routings should be 
studied further in feasibility studies but it is recommended at least one 42” pipeline connects the south east to the north west of the 
country and as large as possible pipelines should be implemented.

volumes close to the gas fields, it may be possible to lower the operational pressure of the 
pipelines closed to production.  
 
Long term gas transmission investments  
The long-term investments from 2032 to 2041 are difficult to break down into actual projects. 
However, some of the investments will include at least one large diameter pipeline extra from the 
LNG import point to Dhaka and further to the west as shown in Figure 8.

The actual routing of the large diameter pipeline will have to be adjusted to connection points to 
power plants and other large consumers as well as to right-of-way and environmental 
constraints.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK – LOOKING AHEAD PRICING OF LNG IMPORTS NEEDS TO 
BE ADDRESSED.   
The demand and supply balance and the corresponding transmission plan clearly highlight the 
need for import from neighbouring countries by pipeline and LNG. Thus, Bangladesh is becoming 
connected to the world market and world market gas prices. The costs of imports will be higher 
than the current cost of indigenous gas production. The legal and regulatory part of this project 
focuses in particular on how Bangladesh may handle this situation.  
 
Current practice 
Today’s gas market structure can be characterised as a single-buyer model with a complex 
system of administered internal transfer prices. Petrobangla acquires gas from IOCs at PSC 
contract prices, mixes it with its own gas from subsidiaries, then other subsidiaries transmit and 
distribute it to their customers. In other words, the Government is allocating gas to consumers 
and administering a bundled gas price set by BERC. Bundled prices, which do not differentiate 
between the price of gas as a commodity and the cost of transmission and distribution, have 
some undesirable implications, such as:  
lead to inefficient pricing,  
 
  do not show financial viability of the various segments production, transmission, and 
distribution, and  
result in cross-subsidies 
 
However, since 2014, Bangladesh's gas price has gone up by almost USD 1/MMBTU. There has 
been a sharp increase in the price paid by CNG users, commercial, captive power and domestic 
metered gas consumption. We suggest a 3-step approach in introducing LNG.

STEP 1: MAINTAIN BUNDLED PRICES IN THE SHORT TERM  
From 2018, LNG will be imported at higher costs than the current gas purchases from PSCs and 
Petrobangla subsidiaries, at current oil prices this would be 6-7 USD/MMBTU. This will necessitate 
an increase in the gas tariff in the short term. Despite the undesirable effects of the single buyer 
model, our recommendation is to keep this current model3 in the short term up to 2021 while 
import volumes are not very significant. In the medium term (post 2021), it is not recommended 
to keep this model, as it would continue cross-subsidies, inefficient allocation of resources and 
distorted pricing and potentially reduce the economic growth rate in the medium and long term.  
 
STEP 2: FROM 2022 INTRODUCE DUAL MARKETS FOR GAS TO PROTECT THE DOMESTIC 
MARKET WHILE INTRODUCING MARKET BASED PRICES FOR THE MOST EFFICIENT AND 
CREDITWORTHY USERS 
Several countries, Egypt and Pakistan amongst others, have introduced LNG into their markets at 
world market prices while protecting key customers not able to pay the full price. It is 
recommended to learn from the experiences made in particular with respect to how world market 
LNG was phased in. In that respect, the key learning is that the establishment of two markets for 
gas seems to be the most viable approach to introduce higher priced LNG. A dual market in 
Bangladesh is characterised by: 1) the current low priced gas supplied by Petrobangla 
subsidiaries to their customers at regulated prices, and 2) a market for new gas supply at 
(higher) market prices to customers willing to pay the higher price to get gas supply. LNG 
importers could be government–owned companies (Petrobangla, Power Cell) or private, selling 
gas at unregulated prices to customers willing to pay the price. A key issue is to determine the 
customers willing and able to pay a higher price to get gas supplied by new LNG imports.   
 
STEP 3: THE END GOAL IS A COMPETITIVE MARKET WITH GAS TO GAS COMPETITION – 
REGULATED AND UNREGULATED MARKETS TO MERGE IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM 
It must be noted that dual markets as described and recommended above should not be seen as 
permanent solutions. In time, with the pipeline connections to India and Myanmar, the conditions 
for gas to gas competition will be present and the market should be allowed to move towards one 
price. The dual market solution does indeed allow for such a gradual transition to a more 
competitive gas market. As domestic gas production from existing fields continue to fall over time 
and higher cost supply from new fields increase over time, domestic regulated prices and 
unregulated prices will converge.  
 
 
 
                                               
3 Petrobangla acquires LNG imports, gas from IOCs at PSC contract prices, mixes it with its own gas from subsidiaries, then transmits 
the gas and distributes it to its customers through GTCL and distribution companies

2.  ROAD MAP AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
The road map for developing the gas sector into a direction where domestic production is 
maximised, infrastructure is developed and import is facilitated, consists of a number of decisions 
and uncertainties. Below in Figure 10 the main events, investments, and decisions are outlined 
for the following areas: domestic production, legal and regulatory and infrastructure.  
 
Priority number 1 is to initiate the needed programs within E&P. Since the results and success of 
these programs will only be known 6-8 years from today, it is important to initiate this now. In 
2023/2024, we expect that the industry and government will have a much deeper knowledge of 
how much additional production can be expected.     
 
Priority number 2 is to initiate the technical and economic studies of the optimal solution for 
bringing additional gas from Moheshkhali to the Dhaka region. This will minimise the risk for 
bottlenecks in the system. We expect at least 3 LNG import terminals in the south east. The 
current transmission capacity is not enough to move this to the rest of the country.    
 
Priority number 3 is the approach to LNG pricing and inclusion into the gas market. In the early 
years 2018-2021, we recommend bundling the price to allow for a gradual transition to dual 
markets where selected customers receive gas at higher prices and higher certainty. In these 
years, we recommend preparing key elements of the market opening. That means ensuring that 
third parties can access the transmission network and that the infrastructure ownership is 
separated from the trading activities on the distribution level. We estimate that if the vision of a 
competitive gas market should come true in 2024/2025, work needs to start 2017/2018 by 
updating and in some cases developing the sector legislation.

INDIGENOUS GAS PRODUCTION 
 
In order to capture the significant production potential in Bangladesh, rigorous exploration and 
development programmes as well as adequate resources and time are required. 
 
Firstly, additional gas can be extracted from thin-bed resources as well as deeper prospects, such 
gas can then easily be tied-in to existing infrastructure for early production –first gas can be 
expected between Year 2018 and 2020. BAPEX has also planned to drill a large number of 
exploration wells within the next few years. The Consultants understand the urgency of such 
exploration programme in order to make quick discoveries and sustain current production level. 
However, we recommend Bangladesh to allow itself more time for in-depth and structured G&G 
preparatory work, as this will improve both the likelihood and the size of the discoveries. 
 
As large geological areas in Bangladesh remain unexplored, we recommend a systematic and risk 
based approach for Bangladesh’s exploration and development programmes to best utilise its 
resources. Priorities should be given to better known areas (eastern Bangladesh) and then 
gradually move to more frontier areas (western Bangladesh).  
 
Key years will be 2023-2024 where the outcome of the seismic and E&P work will be known, if 
unsuccessful decisions on for example additional LNG will have to be taken in these years.  
 
As the future E&P of indigenous gas becomes increasingly larger and challenging, it requires 
systematic capacity building and the strengthening of human resources in Petrobangla and its 
subsidiaries. We recommend relevant authorities to give adequate managerial and financial 
support for such development.

INFRASTRUCTURE – ACTION PLAN 
 
Infrastructure action plan is in the short to medium term focuses 3 areas 1) secure the necessary 
transmission capacity from Moheshkhali to the Dhaka region. 2) develop cross border 
connections with India and Myanmar in the short and medium term respectively. 3) develop the 
internal transmission system to avoid bottlenecks from east to west. 
 
Further development of transmission capacity from the south east to the central and western part 
of the country can and should be done both onshore and offshore. Since there is a need for 
evacuating gas from the south east at Moheshkhali, we recommend starting with the onshore 
pipeline. It has been scheduled for 2021 – this ambitious completion would potentially stretch 
into 2022/2023 depending on the level of challenges and obstacles with key issues such as right 
of way. The offshore pipeline will require more time, and we estimate that it at the earliest can 
be operational by 2026. In both cases, the decision to undertake the necessary studies must be 
taken in 2017 in order not to lose time.  
 
To increase system reliability, diversification, and bargaining power, we recommend connecting 
with India (Khulna) in 2021 and Myanmar in 2023. Failure to connect with India will imply a 
shortage of gas in the western part of Bangladesh. The connection with Myanmar we believe 
should be pursued regardless of the developments on indigenous gas production.  
 
The transmission system will have to be upgraded in order to transport the volumes from the 
landing point in the south east to the rest of the system. We strongly recommend increasing 
diameter size whenever possible in order to prepare the system for future growth and to exploit 
economies of scale. Often this means installing 36” pipelines instead of 30”.  
 
We estimate that the year of 2023 marks a decisive year for gas infrastructure investment. By 
then, it should be known whether the E&P programs described previously have been successful or 
not. Lack of success would necessitate further import most likely as LNG unless additional 
amounts and flexibility exists in India and Myanmar.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY ACTION PLAN 
 
The action plan for the legal and regulatory analysis gives recommendations as to how to 
accommodate the higher LNG prices, open the market to competition and update the regulatory 
framework within the upstream sector. The key challenge is the treatment of LNG in the short 
run, establishing the infrastructure and ensuring the smooth flow of gas from the terminals is a 
challenge in itself and requires time and adaptation. Thus, we do not recommend implementing 
the dual markets overnight. A preparation period of 3-4 years is suggested to prepare the 
market, hereunder determining which customers should be eligible for higher prices. Meanwhile 
in the period 2018-2021, we recommend continuing the current practise of pooling/mixing the 
prices, although not optimal it may very well be the only option which is implementable in the 
short term. This implies that unless the State is covering the increased costs of purchasing gas, 
prices will increase for consumers. The distribution of these price increases is at the end of the 
day a political decision. Dual markets should also be seen as a transition. As domestic gas 
production from existing fields continue to fall over time and higher cost supply from new fields 
increase over time, domestic regulated prices and unregulated prices will converge. 
 
Two preconditions for the above development exist, 1) changes to the current legal and 
regulatory environment and 2) development of infrastructure. The changes to the legal and 
regulatory framework must be focused on two separate areas: 
 
  Provision of third party access to the network: third party access could in the future be 
beneficial to Bangladesh and could support on opening of the markets by allowing suppliers 
and producers to supply directly to consumers and retailers. This requires enhancement of 
the responsibilities of BERC regarding tariff determination and licensees for the various 
functions within the gas market. Finally, the network code for the transmission system must 
be developed. This will determine the rules and access conditions for third parties, the 
financial requirements, etc.   
 
  Unbundling of distribution companies and transfers of ownership of all existing transmission 
infrastructure to GTCL; We recommend in the medium term to address the ownership of 
assets in Bangladesh. Currently, some transmission assets are owned by the distribution 
companies, we recommend transferring this to GTCL. Meanwhile, to avoid conflict of interest 
we recommend to legally unbundle the distribution companies into an infrastructure owner 
and a trading/supply company.      
 
The development of infrastructure is outlined in the previous section. With respect to the impact 
on the regulatory changes, it is important to highlight that the opening of the market must go 
hand in hand with the infrastructure developments. In particular pipeline developments as this 
enables competition between different gas sources.

3.  INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT 
3.1  Background 
This Gas Sector Master Plan 2017 is an update of the 2006 plan which was prepared for the time 
horizon up to the year 2025. The primary aim of the present GSMP 2017 is to update the 
GSMP2006 to align it with Bangladesh’s current infrastructure development priorities and guide 
the development of the sector through 2041. In this context, coordination has been carried out 
with the Power Sector Master Plan 2016 and the team behind it. However, assumptions and 
scenarios are different than in the PSMP2016, not least due to the dramatic change in 
international gas prices, in wake of the decline in oil prices in late 2014.  
 
Natural Gas is the principal source of commercial energy which accounts for about 79% primary 
commercial energy supply in the country. It is used for generation of electricity, manufacturing of 
urea fertiliser, industrial, commercial and domestic purposes and also for burning of bricks, tea 
processing and as fuel for CNG operated vehicles. In Fiscal Year 2015-2016, Share of gas based 
on installed generation capacity (MW) is 61.69% and share of gas based on net energy 
generation (MkWh) is 68.33%. The number of discovered gas fields in the country is 26. The total 
reserve of recoverable (Proven + Probable) gas is 27.12 TCF and a total of 14.38 TCF gas had 
been produced up to December 2016, net remaining reserve is 12.74 TCF on January 2017. 
Presently, 20 gas fields are in production producing in aggregate at a rate of about 2,750 
MMCFD. 
 
The Government of Bangladesh has a vision to become a middle-income country by 2021 and a 
developed country by 2041, and it is one of the fast-growing economies in the Asian region. Its 
GDP is growing at a rate higher than 6% per annum. Dependable supply of energy at affordable 
cost is a precondition for sustainable growth. With fast paced growth and uplift in the standard of 
living, demand for energy is growing rapidly in Bangladesh.  
 
The purpose of the GSMP 2017 is to provide a strategic technical plan for the long-term 
development of the gas sector in Bangladesh. The sector faces a critical point as domestic 
production is projected to decline and additional supplies will require increased investment and 
an opening of the sector to import and world market prices of gas. The primary objective of the 
GSMP 2017 would be to identify a possible path for developing additional supply and to lay the 
foundations for informed policy making. 
 
The new GSMP 2017 focuses on:  
  Gas demand-supply projection, with the latter based on long-run marginal cost of supply; 
  Assessment of Oil & Gas exploration possibilities and development of a road map to enhance 
Gas reserve; 
  Gas field development to meet the growing demand; 
  
 
  
25 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Considering the flow patterns from various gas fields to the demand centres using the 
existing infrastructure;  
LNG import facilities;  
 
  Regional gas development and integration of Bangladesh gas system with neighbouring 
countries; 
  Optimising expansion of gas supply and transmission infrastructure in the medium- and long-
term;  
  Recommendations on changes to the policy, legal, regulatory and institutional framework 
required to support long-term gas development. 
 
The expected results of the assignment are:  
  The study is expected to constitute a medium-term plan for least-cost augmentation of supply 
and sustainable development of the gas sector in Bangladesh. 
 
3.2  Problem statement 
Since the GSMP2006, the oil & gas sector has undergone significant changes globally as well as 
locally in Bangladesh. Global energy prices were already in 2006 on the rise supported by rising 
demand and slumps in supply of oil and gas.  
Figure 12: Historical Energy Prices, USD/mmbtu 
 
Source: World Bank 2017 
 
Today, prices of oil and gas have come down and have remained relatively stable at around 50 
USD/bbl. The World Bank outlook for 2030 is presented below showing sustained low prices of 
gas compared to the past 10 years.

Several elements are in favour of a prolonged decline in commodity prices. First of all, there is an 
expectation that the world in the short to medium term will experience a supply glut of LNG 
caused by many of the mega projects initiated during the booming oil and gas years now being 
finished especially in Australia. Secondly, since the GSMP2006, the United States has undergone 
a revolution within its energy sector leading the United States to become an exporter of gas 
instead of importer, as was envisaged back in 2006. Thirdly, some of the high potential markets 
such as the European market are moving away from fossil fuels and will in the future use less gas 
than what was anticipated previously. Fourthly, recent events in the Middle East; 
sanctions being lifted on Iran;  
 
  Qatar lifting its Moratorium on gas exports;  
  and the coalition of Arab states imposing a ban on Qatar might push the LNG markets 
further downwards.  
 
The changed price picture has implications for the choices of Bangladesh – especially now when  
the country is becoming an importer of LNG.  
 
Locally in Bangladesh, GDP has been increasing significantly with year on year growth rates of 
minimum 6.0 % in local real value since 2006. Bangladesh, a self-sufficient country in gas since 
the 1950’ies has experienced difficulties in meeting the growing demand for energy, in particular 
gas. The shortfall in energy has in effect been limiting the economic growth in the society. The 
reasons for demand outpacing supply are many and should be found on both the supply and the 
demand side. On the demand side several factors have facilitated an exceptional growth in 
energy and gas demand, the most significant being:  
 
  The average growth rate over the period 2002-2016 was 6.0%. The exponentially growing 
GDP has had a direct impact on energy demand. 
  
 
  
27 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Population levels have been growing significantly and steady, on average 1.3% per annum. 
Bangladesh’s population in 2016 was estimated to be at 162.9 million, which is a 19.6% 
change compared to 2002 where the population was 136.2 million. 
 
  Domestic gas pricing: Offering gas well below economic prices has implied a high demand in 
some areas of society. The effects of energy subsidies are well-known and have been studied 
intensively by IMF and the World Bank; when natural gas prices are subsidised, it leads to a 
rapid growth in gas consumption and electricity consumption as gas is one of the main fuels 
for power generation. Low natural gas prices lead to underinvestment in the energy sector 
and even in countries where producers and transmission and distribution companies (often 
the National Oil and Gas Company) are compensated in the state’s fiscal budget, the payment 
is often not large enough to invest in new production and infrastructure, resulting in fuel and 
electricity shortages. When international energy prices go up, energy subsidies lead to a 
rapidly rising fiscal burden in gas importing countries. Exporting countries also incur a cost, in 
the form of foregone revenues that could have been invested in new infrastructure or other 
government programs. 
 
Supply has entirely been from domestic resources. However, the current domestic resources 
have not been adequate to supply the energy demands resulting from the growing population 
and GDP. Several of the major producing fields, originally discovered back in the 60’ies and 
70’ies, are in decline. Efforts have been made to increase supply from domestic production during 
various licensing rounds; however, the interest from IOCs has been limited.   
 
Thus, with GDP and population levels continuing to expand, the Government has been faced with 
a limited set of choices in the short term. Initiatives to curb gas demand through regulatory 
changes and demand side measures have been initiated, the most significant being increasing 
prices and reduction in subsidies and an immediate halt to expansions of the domestic 
consumption. 
 
On the gas sourcing side, efforts to meet the demand for gas have been concentrated around 
development of LNG import to the country and maximising the output from the existing 
producing fields. LNG import is expected to commence in 2018.  
 
Thus, Bangladesh faces a number of important choices with respect to the paths that the country 
can chose from. Continuing the present path with future declining production, increasing 
demand, and residual demand to be covered by imports could have a series of negative 
consequences to the country, the most significant are:  
 
Lack of gas and energy to meet domestic demand putting a ceiling on economic growth.  
 
  Significant exposure to international gas and energy prices implying a high risk of an 
increased fiscal burden – which the country cannot afford in the long run.   
  Poor bargaining position vis-à-vis suppliers of LNG.

Lack of investments in gas sector infrastructure – increasing the pressure on the current 
 
system.  
  Political and social instability as a result of the above.  
 
This report outlines alternative paths and has concrete and specific recommendations which 
would support this formulated in a road map for the country.  
 
3.3  Overview of this final report 
The Final Report is divided into the following chapters: chapter 4 gas demand analysis, where 
energy and gas demand is investigated and developed for three different scenarios. In the 
following chapter 5, domestic gas supply is addressed. In chapter 6, the various supply 
possibilities coupled with demand developments are presented to present the least cost of supply 
in the short, medium, and long term. Chapter 7 presents the transmission system of Bangladesh 
bringing together the previous chapters in a simple framework that allows illustration and 
detection of bottlenecks in the system given the different development paths with Bangladesh 
starting to import gas. Chapter 8 presents the cross-border pipeline import solutions for 
Bangladesh – a topic which was not analysed in GSMP2006. Chapter 9 presents the LNG import 
options and plans. Chapter 10 addresses the legal and regulatory changes needed in order to 
achieve the least cost solution and support the development of the sector. Changes in the 
regulatory framework impact both the demand and the supply.

4.  GAS DEMAND 
4.1  Bangladesh energy sector current status – a burning challenge 
 
4.1.1  Primary energy consumption compared to peer countries 
Bangladesh has been facing a severe challenge of energy shortage. In 1994, the primary energy 
consumption per capita of Bangladesh was only 0.13 tonne of oil equivalent (toe). In 2014, this 
figure increased to 0.22 toe, still at a low level comparing to other Asian countries. For example, 
on a per capita basis, Thailand consumes 9 times as much primary energy consumption as 
Bangladesh, see Figure 14.

Looking at this in context, Bangladesh’s GDP per capita in 2014 was USD924 (measured at 
constant 2010 price), similar to that of India in 2004. However, the energy consumption stories 
of these two countries are very different. India’s primary energy consumption per capita in 2004 
was already twice as large as that of Bangladesh in 2014. It can be argued that India has had a 
high concentration of coal in its primary energy mix, less energy efficient than gas; therefore, the 
difference between Bangladesh and India may be overstated when looking at primary energy 
consumption. However, the difference in electricity consumption per capita was 46%, less 
dramatic yet still significant.

According to Bangladesh’s 7th Five Year Plan, the government has the intention to pursuit an 
export-led economic growth model, a strategy that brought rapid GDP growth to China. China 
became a member of World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2001, exporting predominately 
manufacturing products, and the primary energy consumption per capita in China has tripled 
since then. This highlights the need for Bangladesh to secure dramatically more energy in order 
to support its economic development plan. 
 
Bangladesh also has a very high concentration of natural gas in its energy mix compared to other 
countries. In 2016, natural gas made up 76% of the total primary energy consumption of 
Bangladesh, ranking the country number 4 in the world for gas penetration. This is on the same 
level as that of Qatar (a major gas exporter) and twice as high as that of Italy (a gas importing 
country).

Bangladesh’s reliance on gas in its energy mix is a result of what is available from low cost 
domestic production, as well as the lack of development and import of other energy sources.  
 
Natural gas has been vital in fuelling Bangladesh’s economic growths over the past few decades, 
meanwhile, it is widely recognised that the overall energy supply for the country is now lagging 
far behind its economic development. The scale of the energy shortage requires Bangladesh to 
pursuit a substantial level of imports as well as diversifications of its energy mix.   
 
4.1.2  Developments in primary energy consumption components 
In the following the various components of the energy mix are investigated.  
 
Gas 
According to Petrobangla, natural gas consumption in Bangladesh has increased dramatically 
from 698 mmcf/d in 1995/96 to 2,645 mmcf/d in 2015/16, almost 4 times increase over 20 
years.

The power sector has been the biggest consumer of natural gas, accounting for 41% of total gas 
consumption in 2015. This is followed by captive power 17%, industry sector 17%, domestic 
sector 13%, fertiliser sector 6%, CNG sector 5%, and commercial sector 1%. 
 
As shown in Figure 18, while power (grid power), captive power, industry and domestic sectors 
have increased their use of gas, the consumption from CNG sector has remained stable and that 
of fertiliser has in fact dropped in recent years. This is a direct result of the shortages in gas 
supply, creating a significant level of unmet demand as will be showed later on in this report.

According to the Petrobangla estimates, the gas production capacity in 2016/17 was 
2,754MMCFD while the demand is estimated to be 3,736MMCFD, about 1,000mmscf (27%) daily 
shortage in supply even if the maximum production is achieved. As a result of such shortage, 
there is now a severe rationing of gas. Even though priority has been given to the power sector, 
which has come at the expense of fertiliser production and growth in CNG gas consumption, the 
fast-growing demand for gas in power production has far outstripped gas supply. 
 
Historically, natural gas has been the predominant source for power generation in Bangladesh. To 
meet its growing demand, Bangladesh began importing electricity from India in September 2013. 
In Fiscal year 2009/10, about 88.52% of grid power generation (net) was gas based, 5.08% was 
liquid fuel based, 3.75% was coal based, and the remaining 2.65% was hydro based. To meet its 
growing demand, Bangladesh began importing electricity from India in October 2013. 
 
In FY 2015-16, with competing demands for gas and constrained supply, according to installed 
generation capacity, the share of gas based power to the grid fell to 62%. In contrast, the share 
of oil based power surged to 29% of the total. Meanwhile, hydro and coal based power both are 
same as the last year i.e. 2%. The remaining 5% of grid power supply was import based. The 
surge in the share of oil based power supply in recent years is a reflection of a major primary fuel 
constraint in Bangladesh. This has contributed to the rapid increase in the average cost of 
electricity generation. 
 
There is currently neither nuclear nor renewable power supply to the grid. However, there is a 
substantial level of off-grid power generation from captive power and small amount from 
residential solar PV – the exact quantity from these sources are difficult to estimate, while some 
studies suggest that the off-grid power could currently account for around 20% of total 
Bangladesh power generation.

Coal 
Bangladesh is endowed with rich bituminous coal deposit, with the measured and probable coal 
reserves total of 3,300 million tons. Out of five identified coal fields, namely Barapukuria, 
Phulbari, Khalaspir, Dighipara and Jamalganj, only Barapukuria is currently in production. 
Barapukuria’s measured and probable reserve is 390 million tons. This mine has capacity to 
produce one million tonnes per year. 
 
Coal produced from Barapukuria has good heating value, more than 6,072kcal/kg (25.68MJ/kg). 
This level of quality coal can be used for coking coal. Currently, the Barapukuria coal is fuelled for 
the mine-mouth Barapukuria Coal Power Generation (125 MW 2 units) and brick kilns. 
Additionally, another unit of 274 MW in Barapukuria is under construction stage. However, with 
such good heating value, Barapukuria coal could be used for higher energy efficient use, such as 
higher efficient coal-fired power plant (Super-critical or Ultra Super Critical) power plant, or for 
more energy-intensive industry use such as steel production (coking coal). Meanwhile, Coal Bed 
Methane (CBM) feasibility study project was undertaken to evaluate the methane gas reserve as 
well as to examine the commercial viability for extraction of CBM from Jamalganj coal field. The 
project was completed in December 2016; however, the result of the study was not satisfactory. 
 
The Bangladeshi Government has a strong intention to diversify its power mix and rapidly 
develop coal-fired power plants. Given the present status of domestic coal, the implementation of 
these projects will require imported coal for fuel. This will require huge port, rail transport and 
coal stocking infrastructure. However, so far there is only one ongoing deep-sea port project in 
Matarbari Island which will be able to cater ships having 80,000 tonnes capacity. This is currently 
dedicated for Matarbari Ultra Super Critical Coal-fired Power Plant. In the near future, however, 
the Government intends to expand this deep-sea port and develop a coal Centre as “An Energy 
Hub” for the whole country.  
 
According to PSMP2016, the construction of Dighipara coal mine and Khalashpir coal mines are to 
be commenced after 2022 and 2027, respectively. Coal shares 35% of total installed power 
capacity by 2041 as per the PSMP base case, and the annual imported coal to be expected as 
much as 60 million ton by the same year. This projection may be revised as the Bangladeshi 
government reconsiders its options in response to recent developments in the global energy 
sector. 
  
Oil and petroleum products 
Bangladesh’s current oil annual demand is around 5 million tons, and the self-sufficiency rate is 
only 5%. The Bangladeshi Government expects continuous economic development. As a result, 
the industry sector and transport sector demand will lead drastic oil demand growth; 6 times 
higher in 2041 than in 2016 (average growth rate 7.4% p.a.). 
 
In FY2014, Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation imported over 5 million tons of petroleum 
products, worth approximately USD3.5 billion. Out of this, power sector (public and private) 
  
 
  
35 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
consumed 1.364 million tons which accounts for 25.7% of the total consumption, communication 
(transport) sector 2.472 million tons i.e. 46.5%, and agriculture 0.929 million i.e. 17.5%. 
Bangladesh has several plans to extend or newly develop oil refineries; however, if the oil 
demand grows as projected, oil imports will be mandatory to meet the demand and keep 
increasing.  
 
LPG 
In many countries, LPG is a precursor fuel in new areas. The introduction of LPG allows the 
market for gas to develop, substituting for other fuels, such as biomass. By increasing demand 
for gas prior to the introduction of a network, the market is developed at a lower cost and at a 
lower risk than if a distribution network is installed upfront and the market developed afterwards. 
 
In Bangladesh, the situation is different; natural gas supply is declining, and LPG can serve as a 
substitute for natural gas in new residential areas and for CNG in transportation. The market for 
LPG is already created, the main issue seems to be the pricing of LPG. At present, the price of 
LPG is much higher than that of the pipelined gas, and may not be affordable for average 
households in Bangladesh. While Bangladesh rural households spend 4-7 % of their monthly 
income on traditional solid biomass, LPG at the market price would be 25%.  
  
A survey identified the key challenges with LPG in Bangladesh. Gas cylinder is not available on 
regular basis, and there is a transportation problem for gas cylinders from dealers to the 
households, often they need to purchase it far from the household. Also, the price of LPG is not 
stable. 
 
Renewables 
According to the 7th FYP, there is already some significant success in the area of solar energy that 
has delivered 150MW equivalent of power primarily through a highly successful Solar Home 
System (SHS) programme. Some 4 million SHS units have been delivered. While the delivered 
cost of electricity is high (about BDT76/kWh, i.e. USD0.95/kWh assuming 1USD=80BDT), they 
provide basic lighting and other services in areas where the grid is unlikely to reach for a long 
time. 
 
Rooftop solar PV systems are also being introduced in the country with the current installed 
capacity estimated at 32 MW. There is also 180 MW of wind potential that has been identified 
through a USAID project. Mini-grids and grid-connected MW-scale solar PV plants are also being 
explored.  
 
Large scale PV is being planned with the first 100 MW plant. It has been argued that lack of 
space is a hindrance for PV development. However, this argument is more anecdotic and based 
on local conditions.   
 
The Bangladeshi Government had previously planned to generate 800MW of power through 
renewable energy by FY2017 with a target of 10% of the total electricity to be met from 
  
 
  
36 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
renewable resources by FY2020. However, this now appears to be overly challenging and delays 
are expected. 
 
Wind energy is a possibility, but due to low and very fluctuating wind conditions, only a low 
utilisation rate of wind turbines can be expected. This may make wind expensive. However, the 
technological development of wind turbines is now towards low wind turbines which can be 
suitable for Bangladesh.  
 
Waste to Energy could be developed, but need to be adapted to local waste quality.  
 
Biogas is potentially a large source of energy, but is presently hold back of the small size of 
farms.  
 
Nuclear 
There is currently no nuclear power in Bangladesh. However, an agreement with Rosatom was 
signed in February 2011 for two 1200 MWe-class reactors to be built at Rooppur for the 
Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission. Rooppur is close to a HVDC link with India and on the 
route of a planned 600 kV HVDC link running up the western side of the country.

Hydropower 
Currently, Bangladesh has a hydropower plant of 230MW at Kaptai (Chittagong), while further 
hydropower development has been planned and the first unit of a Pumped Storage Power Plant 
(100 MW) is expected to be commissioned by 2030.  
 
Bangladesh also has a strong interest to import hydropower from neighbouring countries, as well 
as to invest in hydro projects abroad. For example, Bangladesh and Nepal have signed an 
agreement to build two hydroelectric plants (1,110MW Sunkoshi II and 536MW Sunkoshi III) 
capable of generating over 1,600 megawatts of electricity in Nepal. 
 
4.1.3  Budgetary impacts and subsidies – the age of cheap energy is over 
The reliance on liquid fuel based power plants and the growing share of fuel oil in power 
generation have progressively increased the average supply cost of power and have strained 
power sector finances. The average bulk supply cost of power surged from BDT 2.65/kWh in 
FY2010 to BDT 6.10/kWh in FY2015, which equates to a staggering 26% increase per year. The 
BERC responded by increasing bulk average tariff at a regular interval. Even so, the average bulk 
supply tariff of electricity is less than the average cost of production. The resulting financial 
losses have created pressure on the national budget.

BPDB has received budgetary support from Government due to loss between bulk supply cost 
and bulk supply tariff, see Figure 21. The electricity budgetary support increased from BDT 10 
billion in FY2010 to BDT 60 billion in FY2012. The budgetary support stayed around BDT 60 
billion in the last few years thanks to the relatively low international fuel oil prices.

Until more recently, the gas prices have been very low in Bangladesh. The adjustments by BERC 
in 2016 and 2017 have increased the end user prices, although they (except for CNG) are still 
below the economic cost of gas.

If economical gas price is considered, the cost of electricity per kWh would be even higher. Even 
without accounting for the economic price of gas, total energy subsidies amounted to BDT 204 
billion in FY13, which is almost 2% of GDP, close to the average of the GCC countries. 
 
Figure 23: Gas subsidies as % of GDP GCC countries

This subsidy excludes capital investments financed entirely from the national budget which 
amounted to BDT 100 billion in FY13. The total gap in energy sector finances was therefore BDT 
304 billion (USD 3.8bn) which is about 3.0% of GDP. Furthermore, in view of uncertainties of 
international oil/LNG prices, and increasing shortage in domestic gas supply, the total energy 
subsidy requirement may become too large and pose serious fiscal challenges to the Bangladeshi 
Government. In addition, research shows that much of the energy subsidies benefit households 
that are not poor.

4.1.4  Energy plans and policies 
In recognition of the energy challenges faced by the country, the Bangladeshi Government set 
out a National Energy Policy (NEP) in 2005. A revision was issued in 2008 adding a particular 
focus on renewable energy. Currently, there are no further updates on the NEP.  
 
However, in committing to the Paris Agreement, Bangladesh submitted its Intended Nationally 
Determined Contribution (INDC) in September 2015, outlining its mitigation contributions for 
climate change. It is also recognised in the 7th Five Year Plan that specific gas sector policies are 
required. These issues are discussed in the texts below. 
 
Energy Sector Policy 
Key objectives of the NEP (2008): 
To provide energy for sustainable economic growth so that the economic development 
 
activities of different sectors are not constrained due to the shortage of energy. 
To meet the energy needs of different zones of the country and socio-economic groups. 
 
To ensure optimum development of all the indigenous energy sources. 
 
To ensure sustainable operation of the energy utilities. 
 
To ensure rational use of total energy sources. 
 
To ensure environmentally sound sustainable energy development programmes causing 
 
minimum damage to environment. 
To encourage public and private sector participation in the development and 
 
management of the energy sector. 
 
Gas Sector Policy 
There is currently no clearly defined gas sector policy in Bangladesh; however, it is recognised in 
the 7th Five Year Plan that specific policies need to be developed for the following: 
 
(i) 
Gas Allocation Policy 
 
Since Bangladesh will be facing extraordinary challenge for gas supply in near future, it is critical 
for Bangladesh to establish clear gas allocation policy to best utilise the limited domestic reserve. 
Even after domestic reserve is depleted, an expensive LNG cannot be used as freely as domestic 
gas was in the past. Therefore, regardless of domestic or import, policy on gas allocation is 
required. “Gas Allocation Policy” may not need to direct cross-sector allocation; rather it should 
direct allocation for more energy efficient users within one sector. For example, within the power 
sector, higher energy-efficient combined cycle power plant should enjoy higher priority of gas 
supply over efficiency-deteriorated aged gas power plants, because lower efficiency means more 
gas consumption to produce one unit of electricity. 
 
In addition, as part of Gas Allocation Policy, policy on how to disseminate gas prepaid meter and 
LPG should also be defined. Some of the current natural gas demand should be curbed by 
  
 
  
40 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
prepaid meter, and be replaced with LPG. A policy should define replacement of existing pipelined 
gas by LPG followed by price adjustment. 
 
Furthermore, in order to promote the use of LPG, the price policy needs to be adjusted to 
minimise the difference between LPG and pipelined gas tariffs. Currently, LPG users are facing a 
more than 9 times higher tariff (at per calorific value) than that of pipelined domestic gas, where 
one 12.5 kg cylinder costs at 1200BDT 
 
In addition to LPG, biogas can also be considered as the alternative of pipeline natural gas. 
Similar to the LPG utilisation policy, biogas utilisation policy may also define how primary energy, 
namely pipeline gas, LPG and biogas can be best mixed. 
 
(ii) 
Indigenous Gas Exploration & LNG Import Policy 
 
Bangladesh still has untapped gas resources. The cost of exploration and development of 
untapped resource is likely to be lower than the cost of LNG import. Therefore, Bangladesh will 
need to focus on investment for exploration and development. Subsequently, LNG import should 
be considered to ensure smooth supply of natural gas. Two LNG FSRU terminals (Excelerate and 
Summit) are scheduled to be constructed and in operation by mid-2018 and end 2018, with a 
nameplate capacity of 500MMCFD for each terminal. 
 
Furthermore, in order to implement exploration and development of undiscovered resources, 
external resources may be required. The untapped resource is likely to lie in coastal/transitional 
areas, hill tract areas or in the offshore areas where seismic survey and drilling is difficult. 
Especially, deep offshore oil and gas exploration requires high technology and huge capital. To 
address such technical and financial issues, Joint Venture or “Strategic Partnership” between 
BAPEX and foreign companies may be sought or Production Sharing Agreement with IOCs who 
are experienced in such areas can be signed. After delineation of maritime boundaries with 
Myanmar and India, a new opportunity has opened up for offshore exploration. Therefore, both 
onshore and offshore oil and gas options could be pursued. 
 
Power Sector Policy 
The Bangladesh Power Division has a vision and mission statement for the universal access to 
quality electricity in a cost-effective and affordable manner, and ensuring reliable electricity for 
all by 2021 through integrated development of power generation, transmission and distribution 
system. In order to seek a practical and short-term solution toward this vision, Power Division 
enacted “Power and Energy Fast Supply Enhancement (Special Provision) Act 2010” is to 
expedite the introduction of highly expensive quick rental power plants. Meanwhile, PSMP2016 
projects Bangladesh to rapidly develop its grid power and start reducing low efficient/high cost 
captive power from around 2020. 
 
 
 
  
 
  
41 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renewable Energy Policy  
In response to the revision of the National Energy Policy (NEP) 2005, the Renewable Energy 
Policy was prepared in 2008. It defines the renewable energy targets; by 2015 Bangladesh will 
introduce renewable energy 5% of all generation, and by 2020, 10%. 
 
In December 2012, the Sustainable Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) Act was 
approved by the Parliament and SREDA was established. The purpose of this authority is to 
ensure the energy security, by promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency and 
conservation. In 2013, the Bangladeshi Government announced “500MW Solar Program” to 
accelerate the renewable/PV solution Deployment.  
 
As discussed in the earlier section, the total installed capacity of SHS is projected to be 220MW 
by 2017. There are also a small number of biogas-based power generations and a wind power 
plant in Bangladesh, adding another 20MW capacity. The total renewable capacity by 2017 is 
therefore only 240MW, less than the 800MW target set by the Government. 
 
Energy Efficiency and Conservation Policy 
In the 7th Five Year Plan, energy efficiency and conservation is recognised as an urgent policy 
priority. The policy effort involves substitution of low thermal efficient gas-fired power plants with 
more energy efficient plants; incentives for adoption of improved fuel use efficiency and energy 
conservation technology in industry; and conserving gas consumption by households through 
proper metering and pricing based on volume of gas consumed rather than a monthly flat rate 
per stove. The potential for conserving gas through these steps is enormous and the value of gas 
saved much exceeds the financial cost of implementing these policies.  
 
Pricing Policy 
In NEP 2005, it points out that “all forms of non-renewable energy are to be priced at their 
economic cost of supply”. The Consultants understand that such policy has yet to be fully 
implemented due to practical challenges; however, such pricing policy demonstrates that the 
Bangladeshi Government recognises the need for further price adjustments, and there have been 
significant increases in end user prices in 2016 and 2017. Further discussions on this topic can be 
found in the Legal and Regulatory chapter of this GSMP report.  
 
Paris Agreement 
Bangladesh is a highly climate vulnerable country and has already been affected by the impacts 
of climate change. For example, extreme temperatures, erratic rainfall, floods, drought, tropical 
cyclones, rising sea levels, tidal surges, salinity intrusion and ocean acidification are causing 
serious negative impacts on the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in Bangladesh.  
 
Moreover, the impacts of climate change are gradually offsetting the remarkable socio-economic 
development which Bangladesh has gained over the past 30 years, which is also likely to 
jeopardise the country’s future economic growth. However, at the same time, Bangladesh is also 
working to achieve lower carbon as well as more resilient development.  
 
  
 
  
42 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
In its commitments to the Paris Agreement, Bangladesh submitted its Intended Nationally 
Determined Contribution (INDC) in September 2015, and it consists of the following mitigation 
contributions:  
 
  An unconditional contribution to reduce GHG emissions by 5% from Business as Usual 
(BAU) levels by 2030 in the power, transport and industry sectors, based on existing 
resources.  
  A conditional 15% reduction in GHG emissions from BAU levels by 2030 in the power, 
transport, and industry sectors, subject to appropriate international support in the form 
of finance, investment, technology development and transfer, and capacity building.  
  A number of further mitigation actions in other sectors which Bangladesh intends to 
achieve subject to the provision of additional international resources. 
 
Bangladesh already has a number of activities and targets that are driving action to reduce GHG 
emissions and help the country to meet its unconditional contribution, including: 
 
  A target to reduce energy intensity (per GDP) by 20% by 2030 compared to 2013 levels 
(EE&C Master Plan) 
  An Energy Management Programme, including establishment of Energy Management 
Systems and energy audits for industry by accredited energy auditors 
  An Energy Efficiency labelling programme to promote sales of high efficiency products in 
the market Energy Efficiency measures for buildings, such as heat insulation and cooling 
measures, and a revised code on energy efficiency of new buildings 
The Solar Homes Programme, providing off-grid electricity access to rural areas 
The country has set aggressive target to scale up the potentials of Solar Irrigation 
 
Pumps, Solar mini and nano grids to address the energy access issue of off-grid 
population 
Improving kiln efficiency in the brick making industry, composting of organic waste and 
 
waste biomass-based thermal energy generation 
  Construction of Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) by the Government of Bangladesh 
and utilities companies 
 
Bangladesh will also need to implement additional mitigation actions in order to meet the 
conditional contribution. Examples of these are set out in the table below:

4.1.5  Conclusions on the energy sector review  
The above findings illustrate the shortage of energy in Bangladesh with regard to absolute 
quantity as well as the range of options. Indigenously produced natural gas has played a key role 
in the nation’s energy supply; however, as Bangladesh’s economy continues to grow, indigenous 
gas production alone is unlikely to meet the nation’s demand for energy. The shortage of energy 
supply in Bangladesh has arguably affected the nation’s economic development, and a growing 
demand-supply gap in the future is in all likelihood to cut back Bangladesh’s economic growth 
further.  
 
As the current indigenous gas production starts to peak, LNG seems to be the only option in the 
short term to improve the energy shortage situation in Bangladesh. The introduction to LNG will 
expose Bangladesh to the risks of fluctuating energy and commodity prices with possibly heavier 
budgetary burdens.  
  
 
  
44 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is a path out of this - a window of opportunity also realised by the Government of 
Bangladesh which has embarked on a journey to reform its gas and power sector. First of all, by 
launching the Power Sector Master Plan in 2016 followed by the completion of this update of the 
Gas Sector Master Plan in 2017, the ground has been laid for a more coordinated and structured 
approach for the future. Secondly, the timing for addressing gas pricing and subsidies might be 
right. With relatively low international energy prices, there is a window of opportunity for 
Bangladesh to initiate a coordinated phase out of subsidies in both the power and gas sector.   
 
The key to the future energy requirement of Bangladesh lies in both the economic development 
of the country and the government’s energy policies.  
 
4.2  Scenarios Setting 
As a country in the early take-off stage of its economic development, Bangladesh faces large 
uncertainties in its long-term GDP growth. At the same time, the country needs to move away 
from the over reliance on indigenous gas supply in order to overcome the growing energy 
shortage. Therefore, the Bangladeshi policymakers need to have various options in designing the 
country’s energy sector policies, as well as enough flexibility to fine-tune and revise these policies 
when necessary. 
 
The Consultants have developed three scenarios to capture a confined range of these 
uncertainties mentioned above, and our gas demand forecasts are then derived based on these 
assumptions. Each of the three scenarios is as described below:  
 
 
 
Scenario A 
Scenario B 
Scenario C 
Modified PSMP2016 
High Growth 
Climate Change 
 
4.2.1  Scenario A - Modified PSMP2016 
In order to provide some consistency across the energy sector, we have made Scenario A to 
reflect some key assumptions in the Base Scenario of Power Sector Master Plan 2016.  
 
In particular, Scenario A assume the same GDP growth projections as that in PSMP2016 Base 
Scenario, where the 7th FYP targets are to be achieved and the GDP growth rates then decline 
gradually from 8% in 2020 to 4.3% by 2041. This makes the GDP in 2041 four times as large as 
current level (2016/17). 
 
Scenario A also assumes the same demand forecast for overall power generation as that in 
PSMP2016. In the meantime, comparing to the original power development schedule in the 
PSMP2016, there have been delays in the commissioning of some coal-fired power plants in 
Bangladesh. Consequently, some inefficient gas-fired power plants are expected to be kept for 
  
 
  
45 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
the next few years and decommissioned only then. Therefore, Scenario A assumes that, in the 
short-term, gas demand from the power sector will increase modestly – rather than drop sharply 
as assumed in PSMP2016.    
 
Nevertheless, the gas penetration in the power generation is assumed in Scenario A to decline 
gradually yet significantly over the forecast period. This is to reflect a policy where coal is seen as 
a more secure and favourable option to future gas import, a policy similar to the recent 
development in India for example. 
 
Except for the power sector, the gas demand for all other sectors in Scenario A is forecasted 
independently to that in PSMP2016, reflecting the Consultants’ own views of the gas sector 
development in Bangladesh. 
 
4.2.2  Scenario B – High Growth 
This scenario assumes that Bangladesh will be successful in pursuing an export-led economic 
growth model as indicated in the 7th five-year plan. In such case, Bangladesh will be able to 
continually increase its export and shift its growth driver from currently a high reliance on textile 
to a more diverse mix of manufacturing goods in the future. Currently, there are already a good 
number of foreign companies (particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) investing in 
Bangladesh, while the Bangladeshi Government has the policy to develop around 100 special 
economic zones and attract further foreign direct investments. 
 
As such, this scenario assumes that the 7th five-year plan’s short-term growth targets will be 
achieved and that the GDP growth rates then maintain at 7% from 2021 to 2041. This makes the 
GDP in 2041 five times as large as current level (2016/17). 
 
In the 7th five-year plan of Bangladesh, China is used as a reference for the export-led economic 
growth model. Until recent slowdown, the Chinese economy had often been growing at around 
10% per annum for a long time although not without environmental and social costs. Therefore, 
albeit challenging, a 7% long-term GDP growth rate seems to be a reasonable assumption for the 
High Growth Scenario if the Bangladeshi Government’s economic development plans can be 
delivered.  
 
Scenario B also implies a strong international environment for trade, suggesting that Bangladesh 
is able to secure enough gas import through pipeline connections from Asian countries as well as 
LNG from even wider global sources. This scenario will therefore be tilted towards use of gas, 
similar to the recent development in the USA for example. 
 
 
4.2.3  Scenario C – Climate Change 
The Climate Change Scenario can develop if rapid change in climate, or understanding of the 
climatic development, takes place. As Bangladesh is one of the countries which are most exposed 
to rising sea level, increased precipitation and more severe storms, there will be a strong focus 
  
 
  
46 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
on the issue inside the country and understanding in the population that there is a need to act on 
climate globally as well as in Bangladesh. Bangladesh therefore decides to become frontrunner on 
cleaner energy and energy savings.  
 
In this scenario, only a few coal fired power plants will be developed, while there will be strong 
developments in renewables, natural gas, nuclear, and hydropower imports. For example, 
although there has so far been lack of support for large solar power plants due to the high 
population density, this scenario assumes the development of a clean energy policy where 
sufficient space will be made available for solar power projects.  
 
In the PSMP2016, it is found that the peak load will change from evening as at present to mid-
day over the coming years. With more solar energy, it is assumed that the midday peak demand 
to a large degree will be supplied by solar energy, while the gas fired power plants will cover the 
evening peaks. It will hence still be necessary to develop further gas network and gas power 
plants in Bangladesh to cover the peak demand too.  
 
This scenario also assumes that the cost of such a cleaner energy policy will have an impact on 
Bangladesh’s economy, so that the GDP growth rates in the scenario coincide with that in 
Scenario A, making the GDP in 2041 four times as large as current level (2016/17). 
 
The GDP growth rates for all three scenarios are as shown as below:

4.3  Gas demand forecast methodology 
4.3.1  Demand vs Consumption 
To forecast the gas demand in Bangladesh, it is important at first to look at the current gas 
market status and make a distinction between demand and consumption of gas.

According to Petrobangla estimate, the gas demand in Bangladesh is 3,736 MMCFD (1.36 tcf/y) 
in 2016/17, made up by the following sectors: grid power 48%, captive power 13%, fertiliser 
8%, industry 15%, domestic 11%, commercial 1%, and CNG 4%. On the other hand, there is no 
imported gas and the current production capacity from existing fields is only 2,754 MMCFD (1.01 
tcf/y) of which IOCs account for 59%, BGFCL 31%, SGFL 5% and BAPEX 5%.  
 
As a result, the consumption of gas in Bangladesh is currently capped by the indigenous 
production; around 1,000 MMCFD of demand for gas is not met. The Consultants have been 
advised by Petrobangla that the demand estimate is based on known customers, while there are 
likely to be some hidden demand, i.e. potential customers who have not expressed their need for 
gas due to the shortage of supply. It should be noted that the actual gas production is on 
average below the production capacity due to normal technical problems. Therefore, the actual 
demand-supply (demand-consumption) gap is even larger although the exact size cannot be 
quantified. 
 
In order to take a practical approach for our forecast, we use the Petrobangla estimate of 3,736 
MMCFD as the current demand for gas in Bangladesh.  
  
4.3.2  GSMP2006 Review 
The results and the approach for the 2006 master plan have been evaluated to determine 
whether the approach is still fit for purpose and complementary measures required in order to 
determine the demand for gas in Bangladesh.   
 
In GSMP2006, a detailed statistical regression analysis was carried out to assess the historical 
(1995-2004) correlations between various gas demand (by sectors and regions) and GDP in 
Bangladesh. The result demonstrates strong correlations between these variables in most case, 
hence the GDP elasticity method was largely used to project future (2005-2025) gas demand 
under three GDP growth scenarios:

Figure 26: GSMP2006 – GDP Growth Scenarios 
 
 
In Case B, the Bangladesh GDP was forecasted to grow on average around 6.5% per year 
between 2005 and 2015, which is close to the 6.2% actual annual growth during this period. 
Therefore, we choose Case B to assess how the GSMP2006 gas demand forecast has performed 
against reality.

Figure 27 above shows that the GSMP2006 has produced a demand projection that is fairly close 
to the consumption of gas in Bangladesh over a 10-year period. It has an error margin of 8% in 
2015, which reduces to less than 5% if we eliminate the difference in the forecasted and actual 
GDP growth rates. However, the actual demand estimated by Petrobangla was 3,200 MMCFD in 
  
 
  
49 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
2015, over 20% higher than the GSMP2006 demand projection. It is therefore in our view 
important to modify the methodology in order to (A) recognise the consumption-demand gap and 
improvements in energy efficiency, (B) recognise sector structure changes, (C) consider impacts 
of power mix and overall energy mix policy changes.  
 
(A)  Demand-Consumption Gap and Improvements in Energy Efficiency 
 
As already discussed, indigenous production has been the only source of gas supply in 
Bangladesh. Despite the significant increases in output over the past 20 years, the production 
level has not been able to catch up with the country’s economic growth. In other words, the 
consumption of gas in Bangladesh has been held back by the shortage of supply, leaving a gap 
between demand and consumption. Turning this around, economic growth could have been 
higher if gas demand was fully met. 
 
This large demand-consumption gap (unmet demand) creates an inaccurate illusion of the 
changes in demand, the correlations derived from GDP growth and gas consumption growth 
therefore need to be modified for demand projection. For example, the elasticity of gas 
consumption to GDP for the industry sector dropped from 2.58 between 1993 and 2003 to 1.68 
between 2004 and 2014. This was a decline largely due to the shortage of gas supply rather than 
slower growth in demand.

In addition, improvements in energy efficiency will reduce the energy intensity for every unit of 
GDP, this in turn reduces the elasticity of gas demand to GDP. 
 
(B)  Sector Structure Changes 
 
  
 
  
50 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
As one sector undergoes structure changes, the demand for energy is also likely to change. It will 
therefore be difficult to identify the relationship between GDP growth and energy consumption. 
Consider Bangladesh’s CNG sector for example: the sector demand for gas increased 20 times 
from merely 1.9 MMCFD in 2003 to 39.3 MMCFD in 2009, reflecting the very early development 
stage of this sector. However, the gas consumption then only reached 46.5 MMCFD in 2015, 
largely due to the shortage of gas supply as well as the fact that the sector was now more stable. 
As a result, the correlation between CNG sector gas demand and GDP during this period was 
relatively weak (with an R-square of 0.74), and the corresponding elasticity of 6.02 is obviously 
not a good fit for future demand forecast.

(C)  Power Mix & Overall Energy Mix 
 
In GSMP2006, gas was forecasted to retain its overarching dominance in the Bangladesh power 
mix, which would only start to give ground to coal from 2015, but still account for around 90% of 
total power generation dispatch thereafter, see Figure 30. This assumption may no longer fit well 
with the Government’s policy nor with the reality of future; therefore, different scenarios for 
power mix need to be considered.

In awake of shortage of natural gas, the Bangladeshi Government has also started developing 
alternative energy such as LPG. A continued trend like this will gradually reduce the gas 
penetration in the overall energy mix. Consequently, the elasticity of gas demand to GDP growth 
will be weakened over time. Nevertheless, it needs to be recognised that it is very challenging to 
quantify such effect and any projections are subject to significant uncertainties.  
 
4.3.3  Approach to projecting demand 
For reasons mentioned above, we will conduct our gas demand forecast based on the specific 
characteristics of each sector, namely power, captive power, fertiliser, industry, commercial, 
domestic, and CNG. In the meantime, we use Petrobangla’s demand estimates as our base for 
Financial Year 2016/2017. 
 
The power sector projections in this study are derived from PSMP2016. In addition to the base 
case scenario in PSMP2016, this study also considers different GDP growth rates as well as gas 
shares of total power generation. Modifications are also made on the short-term outlook to reflect 
a more updated and realistic picture of the development status power plants in Bangladesh. 
 
We use GDP elasticity method for industry and domestic sectors’ demand forecasts. In the 
absence of relevant data, we use the elasticity of gas consumption to GDP as a proxy for demand 
analysis. Meanwhile, we make modifications to these elasticities in recognition of the historical 
consumption-demand gaps as well as higher gas prices and future improvements in energy 
efficiencies. 
 
Finally, we assume constant gas demand from fertiliser and commercial sectors due to food 
security and government energy policy respectively, and a constant rate of demand growth from 
  
 
  
52 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
CNG sector post 2020. In contrast, we assume the gas demand from the captive power sector to 
gradually decline over time due to the development of grid power. 
 
4.4  Power sector gas demand forecast  
 
4.4.1  Historical trend of power consumption 
As shown in Figure 31, the total power consumption of Bangladesh increased by 4 times from 
11,409GWh in 2001 to 45,299GWh in 2016. The domestic (residential) sector is the largest 
consumer and accounted for 51% of the total power consumption in 2016, followed by industry 
sector consuming 34% of the total.

4.4.2  Power Plants 
According to PSMP2016, the total power generation capacity in Bangladesh was 10.9GW in 2015 
where gas-fired power plants accounted for 62%. The total installed capacity of gas-fired power 
has increased since then, and lists of existing gas-fired power plants and planned new gas-fired 
power plants are included in Appendix 2.  
 
4.4.3  Methodology 
In order to provide a reference to the Bangladeshi policy makers, this GSMP adopts the PSM2016 
methodology in forecasting the power demand and subsequently the associated gas demand in 
the power sector. Additional scenarios with different GDP and gas share of total power generation 
have also been included to reflect our views on future possibilities – this in turn leads to different 
power and gas demand forecasts. 
 
  
 
  
53 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, some key assumptions in PSMP2016 are no longer up to date. Therefore, modifications 
are required to give more realistic projections.  
 
For example, PSMP2016 base case forecasts that the gas share of total power generation declines 
rapidly from 69% in 2018 to 62% in 2019 and then to 36% in 2020 – a result of a number of 
new built coal-fired power plants. However, the Consultants understand that practical challenges 
and constraints have already delayed some of the proposed new power plants in the original 
Power Development Plan set out in PSMP2016. Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi Government is open 
to adjust its power mix policy in response to recent significant changes in global energy 
environment, e.g. low international prices for oil and gas. Hence, gas-fired power plants will need 
to maintain a high share of power generation in the short-term. 
 
PSMP2016 base case forecast also assumes a number of old gas-fired power plants to be retired 
over the next few years, while many new gas-fired power plants are to be commissioned during 
the same period – thereby improving the average operational efficiency of gas-fired power plants 
from around 25% in 2019 to around 40% in 2020. This also seems to be unlikely due to practical 
challenges and constraints. It is our view that many old gas-fired power plants will continue to 
operate for a longer period of time until new replacements are gradually in place – hence only 
gradual improvements in the average operational plant efficiency.  
 
4.4.4  Peak demand projection 
PSMP2016 adopted the GDP elasticity method for peak demand projection, we will therefore use 
the same approach in this study. 
 
Deciding the level at which the baseline is to be set is an important factor in peak power demand 
forecasting. Because of the particular situation in Bangladesh whereby rolling blackouts have 
been used as a measure to circumvent power shortages at the peak hours, the recorded 
maximum power consumption does not include such potential power demand. Therefore, an 
accurate forecast of the maximum demand including the potential demand requires a theoretical 
estimation of load curves from the daily operational data with particular attention on the 
characteristics of the seasonal changes in the daily load curve and the frequency and durations of 
rolling blackouts. Because rolling blackouts have been relatively rare on weekends and holidays 
in the winter (between November and January), a daily load curve gives an actual peak load (at 
the hours of the peak power consumption for lighting) that is quite accurate. A daily load curve in 
the summer gives estimates of the base and intermediate loads close to the recorded values. 
 
Therefore, a composite daily load curve representing the peak power demand was created from 
the daily load curve in the summer with part of the peak hours replaced by the same part of the 
daily load curve in the winter as shown in the figure below. The peak power demand in FY2014, 
which was used as the baseline for the peak demand forecast, was set at 8,039 MW by adding 
the base and intermediate load in the summer (5,487 MW and 1,043 MW, respectively) and the 
peak load in the winter (1,811 MW) recorded in FY2015. The peak power demand in FY2015 was 
  
 
  
54 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
estimated at 8,921 MW in the same way and this value was used as the reference value in the 
peak power demand forecast. 
Figure 32: Peak power curves 
 
Source: PSMP2016 
 
Table 7 below shows the results of the maximum load analysis. The maximum load recorded in 
FY 2015 was 7,500 MW, while a maximum load of approximately 8,921 MW was estimated from 
the estimated base load of 6,170 MW, the potential intermediate and peak-hour loads and the 
actual net/gross ratio. Therefore, the 8,291 MW obtained in this analysis is used as the reference 
value in the long-term demand forecast up to 2041. 
Table 7: Peak load estimation 2005-2015 
 
Source: PSMP2016 
 
Table 8 below shows the historical trend for GDP elasticity of power demand in Bangladesh for 
the last 10 years, and the average was 1.27. Considering that the elasticity in some other ASEAN 
countries (Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia) also fell in the range between 1.1 and 1.3, see Table 9, 
this study assumes that this 1.27 will continue in the BAU (business-as-usual) case.

Based on the GDP elasticity method, the Bangladesh peak power demand is projected to grow to 
51GW by 2041 in Scenario A and Scenario C, and 69GW in Scenario B, as illustrated in figure 
below.

4.4.5  Power demand and gas share of total power generation projection 
According to PSMP2016, the plant factor remains stable in between 69-70% between 2017 and 
2030, then gradually declines to 63% by 2041. We have therefore used this set of plant factors 
for power demand (GWh) forecast. In the 5 scenarios of PSMP2016, for each year from 2017 to 
2041, power generation requirement forecast is the same but fuel mix generation is not equal.  
 
In Scenario A, we assume that Bangladesh significantly changes its power sector mix by 
aggressively pursuing alternative energy sources, especially coal. The gas share of total power 
generation requirement in this scenario stays at 70% of total between 2017 and 2020, then 
decreases significantly to merely 20% by 2041. 
 
In Scenario B, we assume gas to have a greater share in power mix, and the gas share of total 
power generation requirement stays at 70% of total between 2017 and 2020, then gradually 
decreases to 40% by 2041.  
 
In Scenario C, the total power generation is the same as that in Scenario A; however, the gas 
penetration is different. The Consultants have incorporated the latest power sector gas demand 
forecast agreed between Petrobangla and BPDP.  
 
The resultant power demand and generation requirement forecasts are as shown below in Figure 
34 and Figure 35.

4.4.6  Gas demand forecast 
The gas demand forecasts in this study are derived from the PSMP2016 base case forecast. The 
difference between Scenario A and PSMP base case is the result of modified timing for various 
power plants, as discussed in the methodology section above. While the difference between 
Scenario B and Scenario A is due to different GDP growth assumptions and policies for gas 
concentration in power mix. 
 
In Scenario A, the demand for gas from the power sector increases from 1,792MMCFD in 
2016/17 to just below 2,000MMCFD in 2019/20, reflecting a modest number of new gas-fired 
power plants to become operational during this period. However, the gas demand then gradually 
drops to around 1,358MMCFD by 2041, reflecting a scenario where existing gas-fired power 
plants to be replaced by new and more efficient gas-fired power plants and even more so by new 
coal-fired power plants. The demand forecast of 1,358MMCFD in 2041 is similar to the base case 
scenario presented in PSMP2016.  
 
In Scenario B, the gas demand increases to just below 2,000MMCFD in 2019/20, then stays at 
this level until 2030. Such stabilised demand level between Year 2020 and Year 2030 is to reflect 
a situation where new and more efficient gas-fired power plants replace those existing inefficient 
plants, hence more total gas-fired power generation from the same amount of gas inputs. The 
gas demand then increases rigorously before reaching 3,690MMCFD by 2041, reflecting additions 
of further gas-fired power plants while there are no further decommissioning of existing plants 
during this period. 
 
In Scenario C, the gas demand increases rapidly by a quarter from 1796MMCFD in 2016/17 to 
below 2,266MMCFD in 2019/20, then steadily reaches almost 3,000MMCFD by 2041. The 
significant gas demand in this scenario reflects a situation where gas is continually to be seen as 
a predominant source of power generation over the next 15 years or so, contributing to a clean 
energy policy before large quantity of renewable energy to be established in Bangladesh.

4.5  Captive power sector gas demand forecast 
 
4.5.1  Status of captive power demand for each industrial subsector 
There is a lack of statistical data on captive power demand from each relevant industrial 
subsector; however, below are insightful findings from PSMP2016. 
 
Textile and Garment 
In the textile and garment industry, both electricity and thermal energy are used in the process 
of manufacturing. Almost every factory is connected to the grid of distribution companies. 
However, it is generally observed that electricity generation from on-site generators is utilised for 
sustaining factory production. 
 
According to existing literature, 80% of factories have their own captive power plant. The textile 
sector alone has a captive generation capacity of 1,100 MW, while the country as a whole has a 
total generation capacity of about 8,525 MW as of December 2012. 
 
There is a commonly observed practice in many factories that the electricity demand mainly 
relies on captive generation from natural gas whereas the power supply from grid is used as 
back-up. This is due to the fact that the tariff of gas supply for captive power is set lower than 
electricity tariff, i.e. electricity supplied by distribution companies to factories is at the rate of 
6.95 BDT/kWh while the cost of electricity generation from captive power is about 3 BDT/kWh, 
  
 
  
60 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
even without utilising waste heat recovery. This is why most industrial facilities prefer using 
captive power generation. 
 
Steel-making and Re-rolling 
Most of the iron and steel factories are connected to the grid; however, many of them also 
generate electricity through gas-fired captive power generation for sustaining factory production. 
The captive generation is said to be cheaper than electricity supply from distribution companies 
by up to 30%. 
 
Cement 
Cement factories usually have grid connections. Though many factories prefer to have their own 
gas connection and generate electricity from natural gas, only 20% of the units have their own 
captive power plant. 
 
Glass, Sanitary and Tiles 
Almost every factory has a connection to the grid. However, electricity supply mainly relies on 
captive power generation, and grid connection is used mainly as backup power when gas supply 
is interrupted or is of low pressure. 
 
New gas connections have been suspended since March 2009, causing the stagnation of 
establishing new factories. Because of the restrictions in new connections of gas supply, some 
new companies use CNG or HSD (High Speed Diesel) as substitute. HSD is also used as the fuel 
for back-up power generation for lighting. 
 
The ceramics industry is characterised by the fact that its manufacturing process is vulnerable to 
low voltage electricity and low gas pressure, and this is said to be the main reason for the recent 
trend of lowered quality and the slump in export. Ceramic tableware processes require 
uninterrupted power and gas supply so that the 360°C temperature is maintained constantly for 
24 hours, and drops in temperature need to take at least 12 hours for recovery which causes a 
huge loss in production. Stable supply of electricity and gas is indispensable. 
 
Chemical, Plastic & Paper 
Many factories in chemical, plastics and pulp & paper industries rely on electricity generation 
through captive power generators for sustaining factory production. About 55% of factories are 
said to have their own captive power plant. Factories that have both electricity and gas 
connections use grid electricity as backup power when gas supply is interrupted or of low 
pressure.  
 
Electricity supply quality is poor and the factories frequently suffer five to six hours of load 
shedding in summer in Dhaka area, where SMEs in the plastics sector are located. Productivity is 
badly affected by shortage or fluctuations in electricity supply. Firms that have gas connections 
for captive power generation enjoy relatively better conditions of power supply, but after early 
  
 
  
61 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
2009, when the government stopped new gas supply connections, firms have experienced 
difficulties with their planned expansion projects. 
 
Agro Processing 
Agro processing plants usually use captive power generation as the energy source for sustaining 
factory production. 50% of the factories have their own captive power plant, and use gas or 
diesel as fuel sources. 
 
4.5.2  Balance between grid power and captive power (gas-fired) 
As seen in the previous section, a common issue in the captive power generation in Bangladesh is 
that the price of natural gas for captive power generation is set at a low level. Thus, the cost of 
captive power generation is less expensive than the cost of power purchase from the grid. 
According to the existing literature, there are many factories that use the electricity from the grid 
not because it’s economically rational, but because the gas suppliers reject new connection 
requests. 
 
Currently, the grid power capacity is insufficient to meet the power demand in Bangladesh. 
Hence, it will take years for the grid power supply to cover the total power demand including the 
part that is currently fed by captive power.  
 
At the same time, there are also many manufacturers who require captive power generation to 
guarantee high quality power supply for their production process, as the power supply from the 
grid is not reliable enough. Such situation will start to change when the grid power becomes 
developed and secure enough.  
 
4.5.3  Gas demand forecast 
We expect captive power generation to gradually decline after 2020s when the capacity and 
quality of grid power supply becomes more strengthened. Petrobangla estimates the gas demand 
from the captive power sector to be 480MMCFD in 2016/17. We therefore forecast the gas 
demand to stay at this level until 2020, which then declines 10% per year before reaching 
58MMCFD in 2041.

Fertiliser sector gas demand forecast 
There are seven Ammonia-Urea Fertiliser plants in Bangladesh listed in Table 10. Six of these are 
BCIC enterprises and one, Karnaphuli (KAFCO), is a joint venture between BCIC and private 
sector interests from Japan, Denmark and the Netherlands.

However, over the past several years, both the BCIC plants and KAFCO have suffered from 
reduced gas supply even though the KAFCO plant has a contractual arrangement for guaranteed 
gas supply with its gas distribution company. 
 
The gas consumption from the fertiliser sector has declined from its peak of 263 MMCFD in 
2004/05 to only 144 MMCFD in 2015/16. This is largely due to the government’s policy in 
rationing the country’s gas consumption due to supply shortages, especially during summer when 
the country experiences peak demand in power.  
 
As shown in Table 11, Bangladesh has been importing more than half of its urea in recent years, 
while demands for fertilisers have not been fully met.

We expect the demand for fertilisers to be largely dictated by the total plant capacity rather than 
GDP or population growth in Bangladesh. Without clear information on future plans on fertiliser 
sector development, we assume that the total plant capacity remains the same. Hence, the 
demand for gas stays at current level of 316 MMCFD which echoes Petrobangla’s own projection. 
 
However, it needs to be pointed out that the 316 MMCFD demand forecast is also largely based 
on the need to protect Bangladesh’s fertiliser sector and consequently protect the food security 
for the nation. The actual supply and consumption of gas in the fertiliser sector can be varied 
based on the availability of gas as well as the commerciality of indigenous fertiliser production 
versus imports. 
 
For example, the average efficiency of the fertiliser plants in Bangladesh is low. 44mcf is required 
to produce 1 ton of urea which is significantly less efficient than the world standard of 25mcf/ton. 
Therefore, it may be more economic for Bangladesh to import fertilisers rather than producing 
them domestically. This also implies that fertiliser plants in Bangladesh may not all need to be 
running at full capacity, and incremental demands for fertiliser due to population growth in the 
future can be satisfied either by utilising more indigenous capacity or by higher levels of imports. 
   
 
4.7 
Industry sector gas demand forecast 
The gas consumption from industry sector was just over 405 MMCFD in FY2014, a relatively small 
increase from 389 MMCFD in FY2013. In the meantime, Petrobangla estimates a demand of 542 
MMCFD in FY2016, suggesting an unmet demand of over 100 MMCFD. This explains why the gas 
consumption from the industry sector has experienced rapidly slowdowns in its growth. As shown 
in Figure 38 below, the elasticity of industry consumption for gas to GDP has dropped from 2.43 
between 1993 and 2003 to 1.67 between 2004 and 2014.

At its take-off stage of economic development, Bangladesh has an underdeveloped industry 
sector. Nevertheless, the success in textile exports has been a key drive for Bangladesh’s 
economic growth in the past decades; this has also increased the industry sector’s share in GDP 
to 28% in 2015. It is in the government’s 7th FYP to accelerate the development of the industry 
sector.

As a result of this pro-industry policy of the Bangladeshi Government, we expect the gas demand 
from industry sector to grow strongly. Given the shortage of gas supply in recent years, the 
elasticity of industry consumption for gas to GDP between 2004 and 2014 understates the actual 
demand growth. Therefore, we choose the average elasticity (i.e. 2.05) of gas consumption to 
GDP between 1994 and 2014 as a proxy for gas demand projection. We also assume that, as a 
result of higher gas prices, energy efficiency improvements and availability of alternative fuels, 
this elasticity declines gradually by 60% by 2041.   
 
It needs to be recognised that there are large uncertainties in the assumptions mentioned above. 
These uncertainties are inherently unavoidable because (1) historical trend in Bangladesh will no 
longer be a good indicator for the future, and (2) there are large uncertainties in the overall 
energy sector both within Bangladesh and internationally. 
 
Figure 40 shows the gas demand forecast for the industry sector. In Scenario A, gas demand 
reaches just over 3,600MMCFD in 2041, while in Scenario B, the figure rises to just under 
4,600MMCFD.

Currently, there are just under 3 million households connected to natural gas, many of these 
domestic users are charged on fixed monthly fees for their stoves, i.e. same monthly bill 
regardless of the actual use of gas. This has supposedly resulted in significant losses due to 
  
 
  
67 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
wasteful use of gas. Initiatives are being taken by the Bangladeshi Government and local 
distributors to improve this wasteful use situation. For example, TGTDCL has been implementing 
the Installation of Pre-paid Gas Meter Project.  
 
In response to the shortage of natural gas, the Bangladeshi Government has a policy to cap the 
gas supply to domestic users, and promote LPG as an alternative to satisfy the future growth in 
this sector.  
 
As a result of the Consultants’ site visits in Bangladesh and interviews with some locals, we 
recognise that domestic users’ demand for LPG is growing fast, although LPG is still seen to be an 
expensive source of energy for many low and mid income families. We also believe that it can be 
practically difficult and economically inefficient to make new customer connections in the suburb 
areas of Dhaka, as it is our view that many of these suburb areas will be restructured and 
redeveloped in the foreseeable future as Bangladesh’s economy continues to grow.     
 
In consideration of the government policy and economic development factors as mentioned 
above, we project that the gas demand from the domestic sector will remain constant for the 
next five years, i.e. until 2022. 
  
However, the majority of the population in Bangladesh are still using biomass (e.g. wood) for 
their domestic fuel usage. This is most likely an impractical option as the population becomes 
wealthier and move into new built residential buildings. The Consultants are of the view that 
indigenous LPG production alone is unlikely to be sufficient for the nation’s growing demand, 
while natural gas is still likely to be required as an important supplement. As such, we use the 
elasticity of gas consumption to GDP between 2004 and 2014 as a proxy for gas demand 
projection. Meanwhile, we recognise the effect of LPG development, weakened gas demand 
growth due to higher gas prices, as well as the expectation that the wasteful use of gas in the 
domestic sector will improve over time. Therefore, we project that elasticity of gas demand to 
GDP gradually declines by around 50% over the forecast period.  
 
Figure 42 shows the gas demand forecast for the domestic sector. In Scenarios A and C, gas 
demand reaches 994MMCFD in 2041, while in Scenario B, the figure rises to around 1,196 
MMCFD, both are significant increases from the estimated current demand of 425MMCFD.

4.9  Commercial sector gas demand forecast 
The historical correlations between gas consumption from commercial sector and GDP has been 
somewhat weak, as the regression results in Figure 43 show R-squares of only 0.53 and 0.72 for 
the periods 1993-2003 and 2004-2014, respectively. Therefore, the GDP elasticity method will 
not be adequate for the future gas demand forecast for the commercial sector.

Currently, the Bangladeshi Government has a policy to promote LPG to replace natural gas for 
additional demand from the commercial sector. Given the small quantity requirement, we assume 
that LPG will be sufficient to satisfy all incremental demand from the commercial sector, while the 
gas demand in the sector will remain at current level, i.e. 38 MMCFD (incl. 8 MMCFD from Tea) 
throughout the forecast period, as shown in Figure 44. This echoes with Petrobangla’s own 
projection.

4.10  CNG sector gas demand forecast 
Started from 2002/2003, the CNG sector in Bangladesh has yet to reach an established/stabilised 
stage of its development. Due to supply shortage, the CNG price is being increased to discourage 
consumption, while the quantity of supply has also more or less been capped. For these reasons, 
there is no strong correlation between historical CNG consumption for gas and GDP growth as 
seen in Figure 45. Therefore, GDP elasticity method will not be used for CNG demand forecast.

At the time of writing, the Bangladeshi Government has a policy to encourage LPG to fill the 
growth of automobiles because of the current shortages of natural gas. However, the Consultants 
are of the view that such policy can be revised as Bangladesh starts importing gas and becoming 
less and less constrained by indigenous production. Furthermore, to support Bangladesh’s goals 
in its economic development, large quantity of additional energy will be required. Therefore, the 
development of LPG alone may not be enough to satisfy the nation’s demand, while the need for 
natural gas will continue to grow albeit at a slower pace. 
 
ExxonMobil projects the global demand for gas in transport sector to increase 3 folds between 
2014 and 2040, an equivalent of 4.5% average annual growth rate. We assume the CNG demand 
  
 
  
71 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
of Bangladesh to hold at the current level up to 2020 and then grow at the rate as the global 
average - a rate lower than the nation’s GDP growth forecast. Given that the CNG sector is 
already facing a high retail price of 17.4 USD/mcf as of 2017, the need for further price increases 
is limited. Consequently, very little impact of price on demand should be included for the gas 
demand forecast for the CNG sector.   
 
As shown in Figure 46, the gas demand from CNG sector is projected to grow from 139MMCFD in 
2016/17 to 335MMCFD by 2041.

4.11  Total Gas Demand Forecast 
Using Petrobangla’s estimation as our base year demand reference, we have derived the total gas 
demand in Bangladesh to be 3,740MMCFD (eqv. 1.4tcf/year) in Financial Year 2016/17. As shown 
in Figure 47, the total gas demand is projected to reach 6,713MMCFD (eqv. 2.5tcf/year) by 2041 
in Scenario A, 10,208MMCFD (eqv. 3.7tcf/year) in Scenario B, and 8,346MMCFD (eqv. 
3.0tcf/year) in Scenario C.  
 
The indigenous production is estimated to be 2,750MMCFD in 2016/17, as much as 1,000MMCFD 
less than the estimated demand. We consequently see a continuous increase in consumption 
when new supply sources are made available.

In Scenario A, the gas demand from power sector is projected to fall if the gas share in power 
generation is to be reduced from current level of around 70% to only 20% by 2041, which is less 
than IEA World Energy Outlook 2016 global average of 23%. The share of power in total gas 
demand drops from 48% in 2016/17 to only 20% in 2041, while captive power to fade away 
during the same period. In contrast, the demand from both industry and domestic sectors is 
forecasted to grow strongly, together accounting for 69% of total gas demand by 2041. 
 
In Scenario B, the gas share in power generation is to be declining from current level of around 
70% to 40% by 2041, much less aggressively than that in Scenario A. By 2041, the absolute gas 
demand from the power sector doubles from current level, although the share of power in total 
gas demand drops from 48% in 2016/17 to 36% in 2041. Similar to Scenario A, captive power is 
projected to fade away whilst the demand from both industry and domestic sectors are 
forecasted to grow strongly throughout the period. 
 
Scenario C projects the same gas demand as Scenario A in all sectors except in Power, where the 
gas demand in this sector reaches around 3,000 MMCFD in 2041, accounting for 36% of total gas 
demand of Bangladesh.   
 
In all scenarios, the gas demand from CNG sector is projected to grow after 2020 at 4.5%. 
Meanwhile, the demand from fertiliser and commercial sector is projected to stay at a constant 
level.

4.12.1  Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited (TGTDCL) 
The discovery of a huge gas field on the bank of the Titas River in Bhramanbaria in 1962 created 
a new horizon for the utilisation of natural gas. Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company 
Limited (TGTDCL) was established on 20 November 1964. The company began its commercial 
operation with the commissioning of gas supply to Siddhirganj Thermal Power Station on 28 April 
1968 after construction of 14" x 93 km Titas-Demra gas transmission pipeline by the then East 
Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation. In October 1968, the first domestic natural gas 
connection was provided to the residence of renowned litterateur Shawkat Osman. 
 
In the beginning, 90% of its shares belonged to the then Pakistan Government, and Pakistan 
Shell Oil Company owned the rest. Under the Nationalisation Order of 1972, all the Government-
owned shares of the company were invested in the Government of Bangladesh (GoB). In 
accordance with an agreement signed between Shell Oil Company and GoB on 9 August 1975, 
the ownership of the remaining 10% shares was transferred to the GoB through Petrobangla. 
After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the company started its journey as a company of 
Petrobangla with an authorised and paid up capital of BDT 17.8 million. At present, the 
authorised and the paid up capitals of the company are BDT 20,000.0 and BDT 9,892.2 million, 
respectively. Presently, Petrobangla holds 75% shares of this company while private shareholders 
hold 25% of shares. 
 
The main objective of the company is to supply natural gas to customers of different categories 
under its franchise area and thereby reduce dependency on imported liquid fuel. Towards this 
end, the company has to construct, operate and maintain pipelines, stations and associated 
facilities. 
 
Currently, the company distributes gas in the districts of Dhaka, Narayanganj, Narsingdi, 
Munshiganj, Manikganj, Gazipur, Tangail, Mymensingh, Jamalpur, Sherpur, Netrokona and 
Kishoreganj. 
 
Presently, total length of pipeline owned by the company is 12,889.03 km including 383.53 km 
built during the FY 2014-15. The total number of customers of the company was 1,897,316 as on 
30 June 2015 which rose to 1,996,801 in December 2015. Bulk customers of the company 
include 3 fertiliser plants, 7 government and 28 private power stations. 
 
4.12.2  Bakhrabad Gas Distribution Company Limited (BGDCL) 
Bakhrabad Gas Distribution Company Limited (BGDCL), previously named as Bakhrabad Gas 
Systems Limited (BGSL), was established on 7 June 1980, initially with the three-fold 
responsibilities of production, transmission and distribution.  
 
Gas supply was commenced on 20 May 1984. Subsequently, Bakhrabad Gas Field was handed 
over to BGFCL putting an end to its production wing. Further, the 2 main transmission pipe lines 
of the company, 24" X 110 km Bakhrabad-Chittagong and 20" X 69 km Bakhrabad-Demra gas 
transmission pipe lines were handed over to GTCL leaving only the responsibility for marketing

gas in the Chittagong Division excluding Brahmanbaria district and Kashba and Bancharampur 
Upazilas (outside its franchise area). As per Government decision, the company has again been 
reconstituted keeping greater Comilla and greater Noakhali Districts under its franchise area and 
adding Brahmanbaria to its operational area. 
 
The cumulative gas pipeline of different categories constructed by the company up to 30 June 
2015 is 3,869 km. During the FY 2014-15, a total of 81,103 domestic gas connections (burner) 
were given. The cumulative gas connection stood at 399,540 as on 30 June 2015 which includes 
15 power, 1 fertiliser, 157 industrial, 74 captive power, 2,140 commercial, 88 CNG and 397,067 
domestic (Burner) connections. In order to enhance the gas supply to the greater Noakhali 
region, a project was undertaken to supply gas to Maijdee Lateral Line from Begumganj Gas Field 
with a cost of BDT 59.9 million. As per approval 10 bar 8" X 5.378 km pipeline from Begumganj 
Gas Field to Maijdee Lateral Line at Setubhanga Point and 30 bar 6" X 207 metre pipeline in the 
premises of Begumganj Gas Field were constructed. One RMS of 20 MMSCFD capacity was also 
installed in the Begumganj Gas Field. 
 
4.12.3  Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution System Limited (JGTDSL) 
Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution System Limited (JGTDSL) was formed under the 
Companies Act on 1 December 1986 with an authorised capital of BDT 1,500 million after 
infrastructural development of gas transmission and distribution system under the management 
of Petrobangla for supplying gas to different categories of customers in Sylhet Division. 
 
During the FY 2014-15, the Company possessed a gas network comprising of 465.08 km 
transmission, 1,336.29 km distribution, 1,205.42 km feeder mains and service lines and 777.34 
km other (customer financing) pipelines. During the year, the company provided 16,546 new gas 
connections - 1 power station, 11 captive power, 7 industrial, 4 CNG, 115 commercial and 16,408 
domestic connections - which was 10.55% higher than the previous year. 
 
4.12.4  Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited (PGCL) 
This is the 4th gas marketing company under Petrobangla set-up with the objective of 
distributing gas in the north-west region of the country. The Company commenced its business 
on 23 April 2000. By the end of June 2015, the Company encompassed a network of 1,626.21 
km pipeline. At the end of FY 2014-15, the company provided gas connection to 1,19,483 
customers.  
 
4.12.5  Karnaphuli Gas Distribution Company Limited (KGDCL) 
Karnaphuli Gas Distribution Company Limited (KGDCL) was formed on 8 February 2010, with 
greater Chittagong and Chittagong Hill tracts area under erstwhile BGSL franchise, 
pursuant to a government decision to rationalise and improve the services of the companies 
under Petrobangla. The commercial activities of the company commenced on 1 July 2010.

At the end of the FY 2014-15, KGDCL had a customer base of 533,273 of which 60,671 (CNG 2, 
Industry 5, Captive Power 1 and Domestic 60,663) were new customers. During FY 2014-15, 
124.83 km distribution pipelines with diameters ranging from ¾" to 8" were constructed. 
 
Following Steps have been taken to prevent misuse and to ensure the accuracy of metering 
system: 
 
Tele-metering system has been introduced initially in the RMS of 5 bulk industrial customers 
(KAFCO, Shikolbaha Power Station, 210MW CTPS, KPM and CUFL) for monitoring the quantum of 
gas supplied to them. Meters with Electronic Volume Correctors (EVCs) are being installed in the 
RMS of load intensive customers. By now, meters with EVCs have been set up in the premises of 
164 customers including 62 CNG, 64 captive power and 38 industrial customers, and they are 
billed on the basis of EVC data. With the finance of Japan International Co-operation Agency 
(JICA), a project for installation of 60,000 pre-paid gas meters for the domestic users in the 
Chittagong city area is in progress to prevent the misuse of gas. Rest of the domestic customers 
will be brought under this system in phases. 
 
Development of customised software by IICT, BUET to bring all the activities of KGDCL under ERP 
software is in progress. Installation of online gas bill system by IICT, BUET is in process to ensure 
easy and fast bill payment by all categories of customer of KGDCL. The company has undertaken 
the work of mapping its network of gas pipelines and gas installation through the Center for 
Environment and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS). 
 
4.12.6  Sundarban Gas Company Limited (SGCL) 
The Sundarban Gas Company Limited (SGCL) was formed on 23 November 2009 with the 
objective of supplying natural gas to the south-western region of the country which includes 
Khulna Division, Barisal Division and 5 districts of Dhaka division.  
 
In the initial stage, the Company has been implementing gas distribution network in 5 districts, 
namely Kushtia, Jhenaidah, Jessore, Khulna and Bagerhat under “South West Region Gas 
Distribution Network Project" since February 2011. The project is being implemented through 
joint financing by the Government of Bangladesh and Asian Development Bank (ADB). To 
implement the project, the necessary procurement of pipeline materials and other items have 
been completed. On the other hand, the Rupsha river crossing work for laying 20" diameter line 
pipe through HDD is in progress. Land acquisition for company’s head office building in Khulna 
and regional offices of other 3 districts have been completed. A MOU has been signed with House 
Building Research Institute as consultant for performing the work of design, drawing, estimating 
and preparing tender document. It is to be mentioned here that “South-West Region Gas 
Distribution Network Project” was closed in 2016 - despite SGCL taking new projects for 
connecting gas to Power and Industrial customers.  
 
Presently, Sundarban Gas Company Limited is supplying gas to the island district Bhola and 
Bheramara under kushtia district. In Bhola one 34.5 MW rental power plant of venture Resources

Ltd, 225 MW power plant of PDB and 3,000 domestic customers and in Bheramara one 360 MW 
power plant are connected with the gas distribution network of this company. Extension of gas 
distribution network in Bhola town and new network at Borhanuddin have already been 
completed. 
 
There have been 3 more MOU signed between SGCL and concerned authority to supply gas to: 
-  Khulna 225 MW power plant (required gas load 35 MMCFD)  
-  Khulna 800 MW power plant (required gas load 125 MMCFD)  
-  Bhola 225 MW power plant (required gas load 23 MMCFD)  
The relevant implementation works are in progress. 
 
4.12.7  Gas Demand Forecast by Franchise Area 
Figure 51 below shows the gas demand estimations for each franchise area in 2016/17. Titas 
franchise area has the largest gas demand which accounts for almost half of the nation’s total, 
Karnaphuli franchise area is the second largest with 14% of the total, Bakharbad, Jalalabad and 
Sundarban franchise areas have similar level of gas demand and each accounts for 10%-11% of 
the Bangladesh total, meanwhile Pashchimanchal francise area has the least demand with 4% of 
the nation’s total.

As Bangladesh is going through the take-off stage of its economic development, there are large 
uncertainties in how each sector and region in the country will develop economically, which in 
turn creates large uncertainties in regional gas demand. Therefore, for simplicity, we assume 
each of the franchise area mentioned above will maintain its share of total Bangladesh gas 
demand, and the demand forecasts are as shown in graphs below:

5.  GAS SUPPLY 
This chapter presents the work carried out on the supply elements of the Updated Gas Sector 
Master Plan and Strategy for Bangladesh. The overall structure of the chapter is based on the 
GSMP (2006); however, updated with relevant new topics. 
 
The chapter is structured into seven sections: 
 
  Review of the upstream supply sector 
  Gas reserve position for Bangladesh 
  Country supply – production forecasts 
  Review of GSMP 2006 
  Analysis of the exploration program by public sector 
  Analysis of the exploration program by private sector 
  Key recommendations for gas supply augmentation 
 
5.1  Review of the upstream supply sector 
This review is based on relevant annual reports provided by Petrobangla and its subsidiaries, as 
well as other relevant documents provided by Petrobangla for this study.  
 
5.1.1  Industry structure 
Upstream,  midstream  and  downstream  activities  for  Oil  &  Gas  in  Bangladesh  are  carried  out  by 
both the public sector represented by Petrobangla and by the private sector represented by the 
International Oil Companies (IOCs) currently operating in the country. 
 
The  public  participation  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry  in  Bangladesh  is  organised  into  four  distinct 
segments  with  individual  companies,  which  are  subsidiaries  of  Petrobangla,  responsible  for 
exploration, production, transmission and distribution of natural gas. 
 
Following  Bangladesh’s  achievement  of  independence  from  Pakistan  in  1971,  a  new  State  oil 
Company, Bangladesh Oil and Gas Corporation (Petrobangla), was established in 1972 to promote 
and regulate petroleum activities in Bangladesh either on its own or in joint ventures with foreign 
parties. 
 
In 1985, Petrobangla was re-organised and formally renamed the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Minerals 
Corporation  (BOGMC)  as  a  public  sector  holding  corporation  with  eleven  subsidiary  companies. 
BOGMC  coordinates,  supervises  and  controls  its  subsidiaries  in  exploration,  production  and 
distribution and are under the direct control of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. The 
organisational setup of BOGMC (Petrobangla) is illustrated in the organisation chart, see Figure 53.

5.1.2  State Upstream Companies  
 
BAPEX 
BAPEX was formed in 1989, by abolishing the Exploration Directorate of Petrobangla with purpose 
of accelerating the exploration of oil and gas within the country and to undertake drilling operations. 
In 2000, BAPEX was turned into an exploration and production company and given permission to 
go  into  production  alongside  with  its  exploration  activities.  Against  this  backdrop  BAPEX  was 
registered as an exploration and production company in 2002.  
 
BAPEX currently employs around 720 (2016) but has in its organisation structure room for 1800 
employees. BAPEX owns three drilling rigs and two workover rigs and offers geophysical, geological 
and laboratory services.  
 
BAPEX  produces  nearly  130  MMCFD  from  Shaldanadi,  Shahbazpur,  Fenchuganj,  Semutang, 
Begumganj, Shahzadpur-Sundulpur and Srikail gas Fields. Since its start, BAPEX has successfully 
completed  work-over  operations  of  27  wells,  drilling  of  8  exploration  wells  and  21  development 
wells. Out of the 8 exploration wells, 5 gas fields have been discovered.  
 
Under Bangladesh Offshore Bidding Round in 2012, two production sharing contracts (PSCs) have 
been concluded with ONGC Videsh Ltd. (OVL) and Oil India Ltd. (OIL) for shallow-sea blocks SS-4 
and SS-9 (Figure 54), and one PSC with Santos Sangu Field Ltd. and KrisEnergy Bangladesh Ltd. 
for shallow-sea block SS-11. The Government of Bangladesh has nominated BAPEX as stakeholder 
carrying 10 percent interests for these blocks. A joint operating agreement was signed with Santos 
Sangu  Field  Ltd  and  KrisEnergy  Bangladesh  Ltd  on  18  June  2016.  Signing  of  a  joint  operating 
agreement with ONGC Videsh Ltd. (OVL) and Oil India Ltd. (OIL) is in the offing. 
 
Participating in an international open tender, BAPEX obtained a contract for drilling Bangora 6 and 
7 development wells which fall under KrisEnergy, the operator of PSC block 9. 
 
Bangladesh Gas Fields Company (BGFCL) 
The Bangladesh Gas Fields Co. Ltd. (BGFCL) was registered in 1956 and was owned by Shell until 
the mid-seventies, when Shell sold it to the Government of Bangladesh. BGFCL became a public 
limited company in 1996. The company owns six gas fields - Titas, Habiganj, Bakhrabad, Narsingdi, 
Meghna and Kamta. During 2014-15, approx. 300 bcf of gas and 180,000 barrels of condensate, 
extracted as by-product from the gas, were produced by the Company, which amounts to around 
35% of Bangladesh’s total gas production.  
 
As per latest report of Petrobangla, total recoverable gas reserve of 6 fields under the company is 
about 12.3 tcf, out of which 7.1 tcf or about 58 % was recovered till 30 June 2015. 
 
The Titas gas field represents 65% of BGCFL’s total production and is the most important field in 
Bangladesh. Gas is produced from 26 wells and due to the requirement to meet the domestic gas 
demand, the field is kept running flat out at almost full capacity. This has led to little reservoir data 
  
 
  
83 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
being  gathered  over  the  field  life  of  some  35  years.  Water  production has  risen  in line  with  gas 
production. 
 
Completed recent projects include appraisal of gas fields with 3D seismic data. The objective of the 
project was to determine the gas reserve, delineate the overall geological features as well as the 
structural extent of Titas, Bakhrabad, Sylhet, Kailashtila and Rashidpur gas fields by conducting 
3D seismic survey. Under BGFCL part of the project, 335 km2 field level 3D seismic survey over 
Titas structure was completed. Based on this, drilling of 11 new wells has been proposed at Titas 
gas field in 2013. Among the proposed 11 wells, drilling of Titas 18, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 has been 
completed.  
 
210  km2  field  level  3-D  seismic  surveys  over  Bakhrabad  structure  were  completed  and  upon 
completion  of  data  processing  and  data  interpretation,  final  survey  report  was  submitted  on  18 
March 2014. In the report, drilling of 3 new wells at Bakhrabad gas field has been recommended. 
Among these, 1 well (BKB#10) has been drilled. 
 
Sylhet Gas Fields Limited 
Sylhet  Gas  Fields  Limited  (SGFL),  a  company  of  Bangladesh  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Corporation 
(PETROBANGLA) under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources is the pioneer in the 
discovery and production of natural gas and mineral oil in the country. Though this Company was 
incorporated  on  8th  May  1982  under  companies  Act  1913,  its  history  of  production  and  sale  of 
natural gas dates back to 1960 under the umbrella of its predecessor, erstwhile Pakistan Petroleum 
Limited (PPL) which discovered gas at Sylhet Well No. 1 at Haripur in Sylhet District in 1955. It 
was the first hydrocarbon discovery in the Country.  
 
At present, the Company has under its umbrella 5 gas fields, namely Sylhet (Haripur), Kailashtilla, 
Rashidpur, Beanibazar and Chhatak with 12 producing gas wells (1 at Sylhet, 4 at Kailashtilla, 5 at 
Rashidpur and 2 at Beanibazar) which produce an average of 140 mmsfd of gas. SGFL shares about 
6% of country’s total gas production. In the FY 2014-15, SGFL produced 54 bcf of gas and 225696 
barrels of condensate and 173730 barrels of NGL. The company also produced 980130 barrels of 
finished  petroleum  products  –  petrol,  diesel  and  kerosene  –  by  fractionating  natural  gas- 
condensate from its own fields and Bibiyana Gas Field operated by Chevron Bangladesh. 
 
The  company  has  been  implementing  various  development  projects  with  the  objective  of 
diversifying  its  activities  and  enhancing  gas  production  capacity.  The  ongoing  projects  are:  (i) 
Installation of 4000 BPD capacity Condensate Fractionation Plant at Rashidpur, (ii) Installation of 
3000 BPD capacity Catalytic Reforming Unit (CRU) at Rashidpur to convert Petrol into Octane, (iii) 
Drilling of well no. Kailashtilla-9 (Appraisal/ Development Well), (iv) Drilling of well no. Sylhet -9 
(Appraisal/  Development  Well),  (v)  Reviewing  of  3D  Seismic  Survey  data  and  reports  of  Sylhet 
(Haripur), Kailashtila & Rashidpur Structures of SGFL & (vi) Workover of 3 wells (KTL-1, RP-2 & 6) 
under SGFL.

5.1.3  International Oil Companies currently operating (IOC) 
 
Chevron 
Chevron  has  the  capacity  to  supply  50%  of  the  natural  gas  produced  in  Bangladesh.  Chevron 
merged with the American company Unocal in 2005 and thus acquired its gas fields from Unocal. 
All the natural gas and condensate that Chevron produces in Bangladesh is sold to Petrobangla, 
the  national  oil  company.  Through  Chevron  subsidiaries,  the  company  operates  three  fields; 
Bibiyana,  Jalalabad  and  Moulavi  Bazar,  under  production-sharing  contracts  signed  with  the 
Government  of  Bangladesh,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Energy  &  Mineral  Resources  and 
Petrobangla. In 2015, net daily production averaged 1,400 MMCFD of natural gas and 3,000 barrels 
of condensate produced with the natural gas. 
 
Chevron operates the Bibiyana Field in Block 12 (Figure 54). In late 2014, the company announced 
the start of production at the Bibiyana Expansion Project. The project includes two gas processing 
trains, additional development wells and an enhanced liquids recovery facility and has a capacity 
of 300 MMCFD of natural gas and 4,000 barrels of condensate per day. The liquid recovery facility 
started up in the first quarter of 2015. 
 
Chevron  operates  the  Jalalabad  gas  field  in  Block  13  which  is  currently  the  third  highest  gas 
producer in Bangladesh. Discovered in 1989, it went into production in 1999. Chevron produces 
natural gas from the Moulavi Bazar gas field in Block 14. It was discovered in 1999 and came on-
line in 2005. 
 
In  April  2012,  Chevron  launched  the  Muchai  compression  project  which  supports  additional 
production from the Bibiyana, Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar natural gas fields. 
 
In 2017, it was announced that Chevron intents to sell its interests to Himalaya Energy. Himalaya 
Energy is owned by a consortium comprising state-owned China ZhenHua Oil and the investment 
firm CNIC Corp. The deal is currently under the consideration of the Bangladeshi Government and 
awaits its approval. 
 
Santos Sangu Fields Limited  
In 2010, Australia’s Santos acquired the interest of Carin and has the operatorship of the offshore 
Sangu field wherefrom production since 1 October 2013 has been suspended. Santos has launched 
an  exploration  targeting  the  offshore  Magnama  structure  under  a  joint  venture  with  BAPEX. 
Magnama is situated close to Sangu in offshore Block 16 (Figure 54) and may hold 1.5 tcf of gas 
in place. A recent exploration well on the structure reportedly was dry suggesting that no significant 
resource is present in the structure. The Consultants have not seen details on the assessment nor 
the drill data. Santos holds a 51% operated interest at Sangu, with Bapex owning the remaining 
49% stake.  
 
In March 2014, Santos was awarded a 45% interest and operatorship in Block SS-11 PSC (in joint 
operation  with  KrisEnergy  [45%]  and  BAPEX  [10%]).  The  majority  of  the  block  lies  in  shallow

waters up to 200 metres with the furthest southwest portion extending into water depths up to 1 
500 metres. Block SS-11 is adjacent to the Bangladesh/Myanmar maritime boundary and is north 
of the about 9 tcf Shwe large gas field situated in Myanmar. The Shwe field was discovered in 2004 
and began production in 2013. 
 
KrisEnergy  
KrisEnergy  Asia  Holdings  BV  acquired  Tullow  Oil  in  2013  and  has  a  production  capacity  of  110 
MMCFD  in  2015  from  5  wells  from  the  Bangura  gas  field  in  Block  9,  Ref.  Figure  54,  onshore 
Bangladesh.  
 
ONGC Videsh 
ONGC Videsh is a wholly owned subsidiary of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, the national 
oil company of India, and is India’s largest international oil and gas E&P Company. ONGC Videsh 
operates  Blocks  SS-09  and  SS-04  and  holds  a  45%  interest  in  the  production-sharing  contract. 
Partners are Oil India Ltd. 45% and BAPEX 10%. 
 
The company had completed a 2D seismic survey over two Bay of Bengal blocks last year (2016) 
and plans to drill the first of two commitment wells on Block SS-09 near Moheshkhali Island during 
2017.  
 
Posco Daewoo 
Posco Daewoo is a fairly new player to the oil & gas business in Bangladesh. The company recently 
signed of PSC with a first entry into exploration phase 1 in March 2017 for Offshore Block DS-12 
(100  %  equity  operator  over  Acreage  of  3,560  square  kilometres).  As  per  the  agreement,  two-
dimensional seismic survey would begin this year, and based on the outcomes of the survey, the 
real picture of gas availability could be known by 2019. According to public available information, 
the Korean company would spend $3-5 million for carrying out a two-dimensional survey, USD5-7 
million for a three-dimensional survey, and USD50-100 million for drilling wells.

5.1.4  Exploration & Licensing 
A comprehensive review of the exploration and licensing from 1950 and up to 2006 is presented in 
the GSMP (2006). The development since 2006 is presented in the report “Bangladesh Gas Sector 
Update” and relevant yearly reports from Petrobangla. Together, these reports provide the basis 
for  the  analysis  of  the  exploration  program  laid  out  by  both  the  Public  and  Private  Sectors  to 
enhance gas reserves. In addition, these reports together with data gathered from questionnaires 
provided  to  Petrobangla  for  completion  form  the  basis  for  the  recommendations  to  enhance 
efficiency and results. 
 
Early Years 
Petroleum exploration in Bangladesh, then part of India, started in 1914, with Burmah and IPPC 
drilling two wells each at Sitakund region, 30 km north-west of the district of Chittagong. Of the 
four, relatively shallow wells, three recorded gas shows. During the next 37 years, the only drilling 
activity was the spudding of two wells by Burmah in 1933. Patharia-1 and -2 were located in the 
very north-east of what is now Bangladesh, but again encountered only gas shows. At this time, 
exploration was based on surface geology and drilling near proven surface seeps. 
  
1950-1990s 
A  spurt  of  activity  occurred  in  the  late  1950s  and  early  1960s  when  the  Rashidpur,  Kailashtilla, 
Titas, and Habiganj fields were discovered by Shell between 1960–1963. There was little drilling 
activity  through  the  1970s  as  the  newly  formed  state  of  Bangladesh  established  a  national  oil 
company, Bangladesh Oil and Gas Corporation (Petrobangla), to oversee the country's petroleum 
sector.  Petrobangla  was  later  re-organised  into  Bangladesh  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Corporation, 
(BOGMC).  Along  with  the  formation  of  Petrobangla,  the  government  passed  the  Bangladesh 
Petroleum Act 1974, to promote activity and six offshore production sharing contracts were signed 
that year. The companies who signed were: ARCO, Ashland, Canadian Superior Oil (CSO), Bengal 
ODC, INA, and Union Oil. All of these contracts were relinquished by 1978, following a combination 
of  unsuccessful  drilling,  poor  incentives  and  political  uncertainty.  The  only  success  was  the 
discovery of the offshore Kutubdia gas field by Union Oil (later named Unocal, now Chevron). 
 
In the 1980s there was sporadic activity with only one or two wells being drilled each year. The 
1980s saw the introduction of Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) with the first being signed by 
Shell in 1981 and the second by Scimitar in 1987. A new model of the PSC was introduced in 1988, 
which  was  followed  by  a  licensing  round  later  that  year,  in  which  the  country  was  divided  into 
twenty-three blocks. The round was unsuccessful, with only Texaco/Unocal JV expressing serious 
interest. 
 
During the beginning of the 1990s, representatives from IOC started to show interest in exploration 
in  Bangladesh.  As  a  result,  PSCs  for  eight  blocks  were  signed  with  four  companies  (Occidental, 
Cairn, Okland/Rexwood and United Meridian). 
 
  
 
  
88 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cairn was the first company to sign a PSC covering Block 16, including the rights to the offshore 
Kutubdia  gas  field.  Three  further  PSCs  were  signed  in  1995.  Cairn  signed  a  PSC  for  Block  15 
including the development rights to the Semutang field, and two PSCs were signed by Occidental, 
the first covering Block 12 and the second covering Blocks 13 & 14, the latter including development 
rights to the Jalalabad field in Block 13. 
 
A  further  six  companies  or  joint  ventures  signed  Memorandum  of  Understandig  (MoU)  with 
Petrobangla.  These  included:  United  Meridian,  McKinzie  Int’l.  Co.,  Total,  Stellar  Oil  and 
Okland/Rexwood. The MoUs were signed for a period of 6-9 months, in which the company could 
make a technical review of the block before committing to a contract. In 1997, PSCs for Blocks 17 
and 18 were signed in by an Okland/Rexwood consortium and Block 22 by United Meridian. 
 
Second Exploration Licensing Round: 1997 to 2006 
After considerable delays during 1996, bidding on Bangladesh’s long-awaited second exploration 
licensing round was opened by the government in mid-March 1997. Although the bidding round 
officially closed on 15 July 1997, with final contract signings scheduled for 15 December 1997, it 
was not until late July 1998 that the first awards were confirmed. 
 
All  of  Bangladesh’s  remaining  open  acreage  had  been  open  to  bidding  as  a  part  of  this  round, 
although several existing fields, all located within blocks 9 and 10, were excluded from the bidding. 
These  included  Kamta,  Bakharabad,  Meghna  and  Salda  Nadi  in  Block  9  and  Begumganj  and 
Shahbazpur in Block 10. 
 
An analysis of the bidding process highlighted the demand for blocks 9 and 10, with these receiving 
seven and six bids, respectively. Overall, a total of 37 bids were submitted on 12 of the 15 blocks 
on offer. Bids were submitted by 21 companies (including Bangladesh state exploration company 
BAPEX). The greatest number of bids came from the Cairn/Shell joint venture with four applications 
for a total of six blocks. 
 
Despite the lengthy delay, the government confirmed the award of only five blocks in its 26 July 
1998 announcement. This was seen as a direct result of the Bangladeshi objective of sharing blocks 
amongst bidders, placing the greater emphasis on ensuring no company dominated the upstream 
sector, rather than awarding blocks based on the individual merits of each bid. 
 
Successful bidders in the second round were Cairn Energy and Shell in Block 5 and Block 10; Triton, 
Unocal, and PTI Oil and Gas in Block 7. Blocks 1, 2 and 23 received no bids, while no licenses were 
awarded for blocks 3, 4, 6, 8 and 21. 
 
BAPEX took part in the round as a carried partner (10%) with Unocal in Block 10 and with Petronas 
and Mobil in Block 9. Later, the government decided to hold a 10% carried interest for BAPEX in 
all the awarded blocks.

Third licensing Round: 2008-2012 
The Offshore Bidding Round 2008 was limited to newly-formed deep water blocks and attracted 
some  bids.  However,  the  ensuing  maritime  boundary  dispute  in  most  of  the  blocks  created  a 
stalemate. In this backdrop, two blocks were negotiated with Conoco Phillips and a PSC for 2 blocks 
were  signed  in  2011.  Conoco  Phillips  completed  the  initial  seismic  survey  in  the  blocks.  They 
relinquished these blocks in 2014 without drilling any exploratory well. 
 
Fourth licensing Round: 2012-2016 
Following  the  delimitation  of  the  maritime  boundary  between  Bangladesh  and  Myanmar  by  the 
International  Tribunal  for  the  Law  of  the  Sea  (ITLOS)  in  March  2012,  Petrobangla  realigned  the 
blocks  considering  the  new  boundary  and  announced  a  bidding  round  in  December  2012. 
Substantial  initial  response  was  received.  Under this  round,  3  PSCs  for  shallow  sea  blocks  have 
been signed. ONGC Videsh, Oil India and BAPEX joint venture has signed 2 PSCs for blocks SS-04 
and SS-09. On the other hand, Santos, KrisEnergy and BAPEX joint venture has been contracted 
for block SS-11. Seismic surveys of all these blocks are in progress. 
 
Petrobangla has planned to conduct 2D Non-Exclusive Multi-Client Seismic Survey in the offshore 
area of Bangladesh to provide the oil and gas industry with 2D Non-Exclusive Multi-Client Seismic 
data of the offshore areas. Bids were invited in December 2015. However, signing of agreement 
with successful bidder is awaiting approval of the Government. Bidding for deep sea blocks DS-12, 
16 and 21 has been initiated by the Government. After evaluation of EOIs, Request for Proposal 
(RFP) has been sent to 3 short-listed companies. 
 
Since the signing of the PSCs, several changes in ownership and restructuring in the contracts have 
taken place. All of the onshore PSCs have matured from the exploration phase to the production 
phase and major areas of the blocks have been relinquished. As of December 2015, PSCs are active 
in production areas of blocks 12, 13 and 14 with Bibiyana, Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar gas fields 
operated by Chevron, and block 9 with Bangura Gas Field operated by Tullow. 
Efforts to kick-start offshore exploration have generally been thwarted by PSC terms held to be 
unacceptable by its IOC partners. ConocoPhillips exited deep water licences DS-10 and 11 despite 
2D seismic data reportedly indicating the acreage could hold 6-7 tcf (170-200 bcm) of reserves, 
according  to  Energy  Bangla  (this  report  has  not  been  available  to  Contractors).  A  subsequent 
review of the PSC conditions led to formulating a new offer for 2016 exploration bidding round.

5.1.5  Seismic data 
A detailed review of the seismic data base is presented by Gustavson (2011) (Figure 55). According 
to this report, the Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. initiated seismic data acquisition in Bangladesh in 1955 
primarily  in  the  greater  Sylhet  district.  SVOC  and  Shell’s  seismic  campaign  started  in  1957.  In 
1963, OGDC started acquisition of seismic data. All these data were singlefold, analogue coverage. 
Approximately 7 000 kilometres of the pre-1971 seismic data are still available. 
 
  
 
  
91 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Digital  multifold  seismic  data  acquisition  started  in  1978  when  Prakla  was  engaged  under  the 
German  Technical  Assistance  Programme.  In  1978,  Petrobangla  also  started  acquiring  multifold 
analogue seismic data and in 1979 digital data acquisition began. Analogue, multifold seismic data 
acquisition continued until 1982. During 1986-87, Shell recorded over 1,500 kilometres of multifold 
data available in the BAPEX Data Center. 
 
From  the  early  nineties,  there  was  an  increase  in  seismic  activity  when  Cairn  Energy  started 
acquiring data within Blocks 16 and 17 and Occidental in Blocks 12, 13, and 14. Occidental acquired 
3-D  surveys  across  both  Bibiyana  and  Moulavi  Bazar.  Both  Okland  Oil  and  United  Maridian 
Corporation (UMC) acquired seismic data. In 2003-2004, Tullow acquired 573 line-kilometres of 2-
D data across the Bangora-Lalmai Anticline. They also acquired a 3-D survey of their PSC block in 
2003. 
 
Additional 3-D surveys have been acquired, are in the process of being acquired, or are proposed 
both onshore and offshore. NIKO, on behalf of their Joint Venture with BAPEX, acquired 3-D surveys 
across Feni and Chattak fields. Acquisition of 3-D surveys of 3320 Sq. Km has been completed over 
Sylhet, Kailashtilla, Rashidpur, Saldanadi, Sunetra, Shahbazpur, Begumganj-Sundalpur, Nassingdi 
and Mubarakpur structures, in order to seismically identify new pay sands and better delineate the 
areal distribution of existing pay sands. 
 
Of  newer  projects  (Table  14),  BAPEX  will  conduct  3  000  km  2D  seismic  survey  under  proposed 
project named “Rupokalpo 9: 2D Seismic Project” from April 2017 to June 2019.  
 
In  early  June  2017,  BAPEX  has  called  for  Expressions  of  Interest  (EoI)  for  the  acquisition, 
processing and interpretation of a 3000 Line-km of 2D seismic survey over Exploration Blocks 3B, 
6B  and  7  (SI  #11  in  Table  14).  The  procurement  of  multirole  survey  vessel  is  therefore  under 
process  for  the  offshore  exploration  which  will  enhance  the  coverage  as  well  as  new  prospect 
identification for future demands.

5.1.6  Drilling data 
According to the data available for analysis by the Consultants, 81 exploration wells were drilled 
between 1910 and 2014 (Ref. Figure 56). Of these exploration wells, a total of 21 wells were drilled 
offshore. This exploration well count, seen in comparison to the over 207 000 km2 of sedimentary 
basins currently identified within Bangladeshi territory, represent an extremely low drilling density 
in comparison to many other countries. The wells have been typically drilled to approximately 3.3 
km  and  have  been  targeting  reservoirs  of  Miocene  age.  The  Petrobangla  Atgram-1  well  is  the 
deepest well in Bangladesh to date and it reached a TD of 4.9 km in 1982. 
 
For the exploration wells, the average discovery rate is 36%, 12% contained shows and 52% of 
the wells were reported to be dry. In overall terms, the general average discovery rate means that 
a discovery is made for every third well drilled, and thus Bangladesh appears very favourable for 
the exploration of hydrocarbon accumulations based on the historical success rate. However, most 
of the discoveries are very small, and thus the discovery rate of significant and important fields in 
terms of gas volume is much lower.  
 
The  most  extensive  drilling  period  after  a  peak in  the  early  1990’ies  was in the  late  1990’ies  to 
early 2000. After a peak in exploration drilling in 2004, the well count has been very low and almost 
stagnant. However, exploration activities got a momentum as in 2009. Since then, a number of 
new gas structures have been delineated, 8 exploration and 43 development wells have been drilled 
and workover of 18 wells have been completed.  
 
However, Petrobangla’s ambition towards 2021 is to increase their activities and a series of projects 
involving drilling of 53 exploratory wells, 35 development wells and workover/remedial of 20 wells 
by BAPEX is currently approved or in the process of approval (Ref. Table 14). Assuming that all 
exploration wells by BAPEX are to be drilled in the period 2016-2021, this means that the drill rate 
will  be  close  to  9  exploration  wells  per  year.  Such  high  drill  numbers  have  never  been  realised 
before  in  the  oil  and  gas  history  of  Bangladesh  and  will  if  fully  implemented,  raise  the  total 
exploration well numbers with 164%.  
 
Data on the commitment by IOC on drilling are currently under questioning by the Consultants.

5.1.7  Growth trajectory of GIIP in fields 
The growth of the volume of Gas Initially In Place (GIIP) versus time from all the discoveries show 
an increase from 0 tcf from the mid 1950’ies to more than 35 tcf in 2012 (Ref. Figure 57). The 
Consultants are aware that not all discoveries made in Bangladesh may have been available to The 
Consultants for the analysis presented in Figure 57. The data available show that the most recently 
discovered field contributing to the total GIIP estimate for Bangladesh is from 2011/2012.  
 
The growth curve is very irregular over the time period and notably two-time periods stand out. 
During the 1960’ies, the cumulated GIIP of discovered fields rose from 4 tcf to nearly 20 tcf with 
the  discoveries  of  the  Titas,  Habiganj,  Bakhrabad,  Kailashtilla  and  Rashidpur  fields.  The  second 
period of rapid growth in the cumulated GIIP was in 1998 with the discovery of the Bibiyana field. 
Since then, discoveries of new fields have not led to significant gas resources being added to the 
known GIIP.

Figure 58: Size distribution of the Gas Initially In Place (GIIP) of the 26 discovered fields. 
 
Source: Petrobangla 
 
From the data available to the Consultants (Ref. Table 16), it is clear that most of the 26 fields in 
Bangladesh are small with respect to its GIIP value (Ref. Figure 58). The cumulated GIIP of the 
smallest 13 fields thus amounts to only 8% of the total GIIP for all 26 fields. On the other hand, 
the cumulated GIIP of the largest 10% of the fields amounts to 56% of the  cumulated GIIP. In 
terms of probability - density relationships then the P90 of the fields is 65 bcf, the P50 is 654 bcf, 
the P30 is 1 000 bcf and the P10 is 2 800 bcf (Ref. Figure 58). 
 
  
 
  
97 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
With  respect  to  future  exploration  activities,  it  implies  that  given  a  discovery  is  made  randomly 
[from a selection of prospects and leads], then there is a 50% chance that it will contribute with 
more than 654 bcf but also a 50% chance that is will contribute with less than 654 bcf. It will also 
be  expected  that  there  is  a  30%  probability  that  the  prospect  will  contain  at  least  1  tcf.  These 
calculations assume that the field sizes occur randomly and only serve to illustrate the nature of 
the field size distribution.  
 
If on the other hand the selection of prospects and leads available are not randomly picked but 
sorted and ranked according to risked GIIP sizes, the likelihood of delivering higher GIIP field sizes 
increase. However, since all prospects and leads are related with a probability of success the risk 
of a dry well may or may not increase by aiming at more high GIIP fields.

5.2  Gas reserve position 
5.2.1  Overview 
A total of 26 fields are recognised in Bangladesh (Ref. Figure 59, Table 15 and Table 16). Since the 
GSMP (2006) study, a large number of reserve studies have been made on the Bangladesh fields 
either using a deterministic material balance approach or a probabilistic gas reserve approach such 
as the one followed by Gustavson (2011). The most comprehensive study of the latter approach 
available  to  the  Consultants  is  presented  by  Gustavson  (2011).  This  report  also  presents  the 
geology of the fields, available data including maps and limited reservoir pressure data.  
 
Since the Gustavson (2011) study, new seismic data have been gathered and better imaging of 
new  and  existing  fields  has  been  made,  and  as  a  consequence  this  has  enabled  better  reserve 
models to be made. For this study, however, no detailed reports of these newer studies and reserve 
models have been made available to the Consultants with latest request for data. The Consultants 
provided  Petrobangla  with  an  integrated  questionnaire  (see  Appendix  8)  requesting  this  to  be 
completed  by  its  relevant  Departments  and  Subsidiaries.  Based  on  completed  questionnaire-
responses on the topic and to the best extend of available data and information, the Consultants 
have attempted to include the results from these studied in the current review for the revision of 
the Gas Section Master Plan.  
 
5.2.2  Reserves Summary  
It is not the purpose of the Consultants to perform another reserve study or reserve certification, 
but rather it is the purpose to review the available reports and prepare proved, probable, possible 
and Yet-to-Find (YTF) production forecasts for the three demand forecasts (Case A, B & C) in a 
similar manner as was done in the GSMP (2006) in order to evaluate whether there is likely to be 
enough gas to meet future demand. 
 
A  summary  of  the  reserves  developed  since  the  GSMP  (2006)  updated  to  the  most  current 
estimates are presented in Table 15. In 2006, the latest reserve estimation performed by HCU in 
2004 was used. At that time, the estimates of the GIIP of Bangladesh was 28.4 tcf distributed in 
22 gas fields with a corresponding recoverable reserve estimated (2P) of 20.5 tcf (Ref. Table 15).  
 
In the reserve studies summarised and presented in the yearly reports by Petrobangla, the GIIP 
from  26  fields  (four  additional  to  the  GSMP  2006  study)  in  Bangladesh  totals  35.8  tcf  with  a 
corresponding recoverable reserve (2P) estimated of 27.1 tcf (Ref. Table 15). In a study by SGFL 
from  2012,  new  reserves  number  are  presented  for  the  Kailashtilla,  Rashidpur  and  Sylhet  fields 
based on new 3D seismic mapping (Ref. Table 15). The updated reserve significantly reduces the 
mid-size Kailashtilla and Rashidpur fields from GIIP values around 3.6 tcf each to GIIP values of 
1.7 tcf and 2.1 tcf, respectively. The reports for this new GIIP assessment are not available for the 
Consultants but nevertheless demonstrated the importance in acquiring new data in order to detail 
the estimation of the resources. The SGFL (2012) estimates are used as in the updated reserve 
position inventory, which form the basis for the forecasting (Ref. Table 16). 
 
  
 
  
99 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Compared  to  the  GIIP  estimates  and  the  reserve  position  presented  in  Table  16,  the  reserve 
position of almost the same fields has risen by 7 tcf or with 25% compared to the values presented 
in the GSMP (2006) study (Ref. Table 15). Such reserve growth cannot be expected to continue 
since there is a finite gas resource in place but highlights the uncertainties that are involved and 
the  need  for  applying  best  available  data  and  models  when  strategic  planning  is  to  be  made. 
However, for situations like this where uncertainties on all data aspects exist within the decision 
process, special care should be made in not making too confident predictions but instead remain 
as flexible as possible in order to accommodate newer and more accurate data and estimation in 
the decision process once they are available.  
 
Similar to the recommendation in the GSMP (2006), the update Gas System Master Plan 
recommends that the Proven + Probable (2P) reserves are used for short and mid-term planning 
and that the Proven + Probable + Possible (3P) reserves together with undiscovered (Yet-to Find) 
resources are only used as a guideline for long term strategic planning.

In  terms  of  the  uncertainties  connected  with  the  reserves,  it  is  appropriate  to  state  the  SPE 
definitions: 
 
Proved Reserves  
Proved reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by analysis of geological and engineering 
data,  can  be  estimated  with  reasonable  certainty  to  be  commercially  recoverable,  from  a  given 
date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic conditions, operating methods, 
and government regulations.  
 
Proved  reserves  can  be  categorised  as  developed  or  undeveloped.  If  deterministic  methods  are 
used, the term reasonable certainty is intended to express a high degree of confidence that the 
quantities  will  be  recovered.  If  probabilistic  methods  are  used,  there  should  be  at  least  a  90% 
probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. 
 
Probable Reserves  
Probable reserves are those unproved reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data 
suggests are more likely than not to be recoverable. In this context, when probabilistic methods 
are  used,  there  should  be  at  least  a  50%  probability  that  the  quantities  actually  recovered  will 
equal or exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. 
 
Possible Reserves  
Possible reserves are those unproved reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data 
suggests are less likely to be recoverable than probable reserves. In this context, when probabilistic 
methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability that the quantities actually recovered 
will equal or exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable plus possible reserves. 
 
The reserves estimates have been derived using a deterministic approach and therefore probability 
numbers do not strictly apply. However, for the sake of this discussion there is approximately a 
10%  chance  that  the  proven  reserve  will  be  less  than  stated,  a  50%  chance  that  the  probable 
reserve will be less than stated and a 90% chance that the possible reserve will be less than stated. 
For the purposes of near to medium planning (0-10 year), it is recommended that only the proved 
and probable reserve estimates be used, whereas for strategic (10-25 year) the 3P and YTF is used 
in addition. 
 
5.2.3  Production history  
A diagram showing the historical daily production data extending back to 1960 has been compiled 
from  the  draft  report  on  the  Five  Year  Gas  supply  Strategy  (Petrobangla,  2015,  draft)  and  is 
presented in Figure 60. The historical production data are the cumulated production of all fields at 
each year and thus does not show the development of one specific field but rather the development 
of the total gas field portfolio in Bangladesh. The production data show a steady increase from low 
numbers in 1960 to peak values above 2750 MMCFD reached in 2017 (Figure 60). From here, the 
forecasted  production  from  existing  fields  is  expected  to  decrease.  The  forecasted  trend  will  be 
dealt with in Section 5.3.

To show the rate of produced reserved versus time then the total production per year has been 
compared to the total recoverable (3P) reserve in all fields as recognised to day (Ref. Figure 61). 
This analysis shows that 25% of the expected ultimate production (3P) in the existing fields was 
produced in 2006 at the time of the first GSMP study, that 50% of the total production was reached 
nine years later in 2015 and that 75% of the gas resource in the current producing fields is expected 
to have been produced during 2023.  
 
It thus took 45 years to produce the first 25% of the total production recognised today, but only 9 
years for the next 25% to be used. This acceleration of the gas usage is an important understanding 
in why timely decisions are very important.

5.2.4  Recovery Factor 
According to the literature the theoretical recovery factor for most volumetric depletion reservoirs 
with  reasonable  permeability  is  that  these  will  produce  70  to  90  percent  of  the  GIIP  value 
(Petroleum  Society  1994).  However,  as  stated  in  the  GSMP  (2006)  “during  the  depletion  of  gas 
reservoirs,  production  performance  is  affected  by  many  factors.  The  basic  characteristics  and 
physical  properties  of  the  gas  and  its  associated  constituents  or  product,  and  its  proximity  and 
interrelationship  to  other  fluids  in  the  reservoir  can  either  enhance  or  adversely  affect  recovery 
from the reservoir. Recovery factor for gas is related to the reservoir drive mechanism. In the case 
of a gas reservoir producing by expansion and without water drive, there is no physical reason why 
the gas may not be recovered down to near atmospheric pressure. In another way, it can be said 
that gas reservoirs under depletion drive can achieve near 100 percent recovery. However, when 
pressure  approaches  near  atmospheric,  production  rate  decreases  rapidly  and  becomes 
uneconomic.  
 
In the GSMP (2006) study, a recovery factor for the 2P resource varied between 66-82% with the 
norm  of  70%  of  the  GIIP  (Ref.  Table  16).  In  the  Proven,  Probable  and  Possible  (3P)  Reserves 
summary table (Ref. Table 17) the 2P to GIIP factor ranges between 41-88% with a mean of 66%. 
The 3P / GIIP ratio ranges between 76% and 90% with a mean of 78% of the producing fields.  
 
In summary, the reported recovery factors are well with the theoretical expected ranges, however, 
the  very  low  2P  recovery  factors  for  some  of  the  fields  merit  further  work.  Ultimately,  the  low 
recovery factors mean that the field is underdeveloped or that production is faced with difficulties 
as addressed below.

5.2.5  Producing Fields Summary 
A comprehensive review of the 19 (2016) producing fields are presented in the work of Gustavson 
(2012) and for three key fields in the GSMP (2006). Study undertaken by Schlumberger (2011) for 
the HCU analysing individual well performance at individual fields is available for some of the fields 
for the Consultants. 
 
Further, the Consultants have requested documentation for the summary report from RPS Energy 
on the reservoir simulation studies conducted for some of the fields (not received).  
 
As started in the previous section, the Consultants find the individual field recovery factors within 
the  industry  standard  for  gas  fields  with  good  to  medium  reservoir  properties.  However,  the 
Consultants agree with the findings in the GSMP (2006) that GIIP can be difficult to determine with 
respect to lack of field pressure data. The individual fields are operated to full capacity, which limits 
the possibility to obtain field pressure data for decline curve analysis or standard P/Z plots for the 
GIIP estimation. Most of the fields also have more than one gas bearing sands, which challenges 
the  use  of  P/Z  plots  as  pressure  and  fluid  communication  between  individual  sands  can 
overestimate  GIIP  for  the  individual  sands  and  then  the  aggregated  value.  Consequently,  the 
reported recovery factors are subjected to relatively high uncertainties. 
 
Overall,  the  Consultants  assess  that  the  Bangladesh  gas  field  production  suffers  the  general 
challenge with gas field development, i.e.; 
i. 
Gas production is directly linked to the market demand which limits the possibility to take 
individual wells off stream for a longer period to determine reliable shut-in pressure. 
ii. 
As production data acquisition and knowledge of the dynamics of the reservoir performance 
starts at day one of the gas-sale contracts, it is difficult to design an optimum development 
plan before production start. Especially in a rapidly growing gas market as in Bangladesh. 
iii.  When the supply-demand balance is tight, individual fields are often depleted with respect 
to demand and not to good reservoir management practice.  
 
The Consultants acknowledge the work of Petrobangla to address the above challenges for future 
developments and re-developments. A draft of the “Five Year Gas Supply Strategy (Year 2015 – 
2019), Petrobangla (2015) was issued to the Consultants.  
 
The Consultants recommend taking the following actions for the future development of Bangladesh 
gas production: 
1.  Incorporate  reservoir  simulation  studies  early  in  project  life  to  model  field  performance. 
Both  the  geological  (static)  model  and  the  simulation  (dynamic)  model  must  be  history 
matched regularly to constrain forecast modelling. (Start simple and update when practical 
feasible). It is imperative that the static modelling captures the contrasts in permeability 
rather  than  a  very  detailed  geology;  gas  flow  is  not  that  sensitive  to  small  scale 
heterogeneities but sensitive to large scale permeability contrasts. So initial flow models 
can  be  rather  simple.  The  Consultants  acknowledges  that  simulation  works  are  already 
  
 
  
106 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
ongoing  at  several  fields,  but  at  present  time  the  documentation  for  the  work  is  not 
available to The Consultants. 
2.  Simple reservoir simulation models can strengthen the interpretation of P/Z plots for gas 
in place evaluations. 
3.  As  production  at  full  capacity  at  all  time  limits  the  possibility  for  data  acquisition  for 
reservoir characterisation, evaluation of production performance, re-evaluation of GIIP and 
adjusted development design, it is imperative to gain excess capacity in the production line 
to take individual wells of-stream.  
4.  Insufficient structural knowledge makes well location uncertain and field depletion risk to 
be ineffective. Compartmentalisation on some fields is also an issue. Accelerated decision 
and  sanction  for  2D/3D  seismic  surveys  for  proper  field  delineation  and  detection  of 
reservoir sands are imperative and worth the investment.  
5.  Water  production  challenges  the  production  strategy/rates;  water  encroachment  can 
maintain  reservoir  pressure  but  can  also  immobilise  gas  volumes  as  residual  gas.  The 
Habiganj field is an example; reservoir simulations can interpret the strong water drive in 
the Upper Sand to return a more reliable GIIP. Further, how fast can the gas be produced 
with minimum residual gas volume left behind. 
6.  Current production is based on technology which has matured and developed – introduce 
new technology such as horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing in tight reservoirs in order 
to maximise outputs from fields 
7.  Insufficient  well  dimensions  and  number  of  wells  can  challenge  production  rates  and 
thereby the possibilities to take individual wells of-stream for a longer period for reservoir 
surveillance. 
8.  Proper reservoir management can increase field performance, i.e. plan for data acquisition 
and early development up-date, reservoir simulation, history matched on regularly basis, 
down  hole  gauge  pressure  monitoring,  well  shut-in  for  pressure  build-up  (reservoir 
pressure),  PLT  logging  (identify  non-producing  zone,  re-completion),  water  production 
monitoring  -  risk  of well  shut  down  due  to  liquid  hold-up,  regular  well  maintenance  and 
workover. 
9.  Production  augmentation;  well  tubing  size  and  down-hole  constrictions,  well  completion 
(shuts  per  inch,  secure  completion  over  all  pay  zones),  fines  –  and  water  production 
surveillance, THB below transmission pressure i.e. installation of compressor. 
10. Plan for final field blow-down. 
11. Re-evaluate  well  design,  tubing  dimensions  and  flow  constraints  down-hole.  Most  IOCs 
tubing design is 5 inch, whereas Petrobangla design corresponds to 4 inch or even 3.5 inch. 
Moreover, monobore should be considered for shallower wells to reduce cost and increase 
production at the same time.  
 
5.3  Country supply – production forecasts 
Long-term  gas  production  (2016-2041)  scenarios  have  been  provided  to  the  Consultants  from 
Petrobangla  and  its  subsidiaries  as  response  to  questionnaires  sent  out  in  the  beginning  of  the 
study.  The  forecast  is  based  on  material  balance  deterministic  approach  and  the  uncertainties 
involving  in  these  estimates  shall  not  be  underestimated.  The  forecasts  are  all  slightly  different 
  
 
  
107 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
from each other but all predict a stable to slightly decreasing production from existing fields, and 
after approximately five years a rapid decline in production is expected to occur (Ref. Figure 60). 
The development in short-term production forecasts is not the main focus here, as it is also dealt 
with in  reports  such  as  the  Five  Year  Gas  supply  Strategy  Pertrobangla,  2015)  and  fields  based 
production forecasts. Here the long term (+10 year) strategic planning is in focus.  
 
The specific forecast used here for each producing field was provided as part of the data return on 
the questionnaires sent to operating companies. In addition to this, the Consultants have reviewed 
the available reserve  data and have  produced a number of forecasts  based on the reserve data 
supplied by Petrobangla. (Note all forecasts are financial year forecasts): 
 
“Proved”  remaining  reserves  of  4.9  tcf  (Table  16,  note  this  number  is  excluding  the 
 
Kailashtilla, Rashidpur, Sylhet fields since these are not provided) 
“2P” remaining reserves of 11.3 tcf at end December 2015 (Ref. Table 16) 
 
“3P” remaining reserves of 14.3 tcf at end December 2015 (Ref. Table 16)4 
 
 
As in the GSMP (2006) study, the objective of forecasting the gas supply here is to determine: 
 
  whether Bangladesh is self-sufficient in meeting its gas demand 
  when new discoveries will need to come on-stream 
and the required volreserves needed to fill any shortfall 
 
 
In the following, three gas supply scenarios are presented and examined:  
 
Case A – Proven, Probable and Possible (3P) Reserves 
This scenario represents best utilisation of existing fields with no additional resources found. 
 
Case B – Proven, Probable and Possible (3P) Reserves with YTF contribution 
This scenario represents best utilisation of existing fields with a YTF contribution of 6.4 tcf. The YTF 
contribution has been provided to the Consultants as BAPEX new, Shallow offshore, Deep Offshore. 
 
Case  C  –  Proven,  Probable  and  Possible  (3P)  Reserves  with  an  additional  YTF 
contribution 
This  scenario  represents  best  utilisation  of  existing  fields  with  an  YTF  contribution  based  on  the 
report  from  Gustavson  (2011),  whereas  it  is  anticipated  that  approximately  16-17  tcf  can  be 
produced  until  2041  according  to  the  Consultants  investigation.  The  YTF  contribution  has  been 
estimated by the Consultants from the available reports combined with an expectation from the 
upcoming  and  accelerated  future  exploration  activities  announced  by  Petrobangla  and  its 
subsidiaries.  Reserve  growth  in  this  model  is  1000  bcf  per  year  reflecting  twice  the  average 
historical rate seen in Bangladesh (Ref. Figure 57) 
 
                                               
4 We believe newer figures may exist.

The conclusion in all scenarios (A, B and C) is that the domestic gas production cannot meet the 
future gas demand as projected by the Consultants and thus LNG import in various amounts will 
be needed to fill the demand gap. 
 
5.3.1  Case A – Proven, Probable and Possible (3P) Reserves  
The production forecast for the period 2016-2041 as presented for the Consultants indicates that 
the gas production per day is 2500 mmcf until 2022 whereafter the production quickly diminishes 
(Ref.  Figure  62).  This  production  estimate  reflects  field  development  plans  either  approved  or 
planned. The field development plans have not been available to the Consultants.  
 
The  Consultants  has  projected  the  addition  2P  reserve  not  accounted  for  in  the  forecasted 
production schemes provided. For this “additional 2P” production no development plan exists for 
its production and thus depends on future development. Consequently, no short-term production 
increase is expected based on this additional 2P reserve although a mid to long terms additional 
production is expected to occur provided the needed development.  
 
The total potential for the additional 2P reserve is 1.6 tcf. Fields with highest reserve within the 
additional  2P  class  and  thus  currently  forecasted  in  the  operator’s  production  forecast  are  the 
Rashidpur and Semutang fields (Ref. Table 17).

For long term strategic planning 3P reserves from existing fields is an important asset to include. 
Based on the forecast for the period 2016-2041 including the additional 2P reserve the 3P reserve 
amounts to additional 4.4 tcf for all producing fields (Ref. Table 17). Fields with a large 3P reserves 
includes the Rashidpur and Bibiyana fields.  
 
The 3P reserve may, if unlocked, extend the production period of the fields but it is not expected 
to contribute to the short term daily production. However, due to the significant volumes within 
this  reserve  class,  production  above  1000  MMCFD  may  be  extended  to  2036  (Figure  62).  This 
reserve needs additional field development and may also be viewed as a “technological dependant” 
reserve.  
 
5.3.2  Case B – Proven, Probable and Possible (3P) Reserves with 6.4 tcf YTF contribution  
In the “Gas Production Augmentation Plan (2016-2041)” provided to the Consultants, production 
from “yet-to-be-found” reserves from onshore and shallow offshore and deep offshore fields has 
been  forecasted  based  on  expectation  in  upcoming  exploration.  The  contribution  of  the  YTF  is 
expected to provide 2.6 tcf from new onshore fields and 2.1 and 1.7 tcf, respectively for shallow 
offshore fields and for deep offshore fields.  
 
The additional of the YTF resource is expected to impact production both on short, medium and 
long term. Addition of new production is in the forecast expected to kick-in already from 2017 and 
is expected to keep production above 3000 MMCFD until 2025 where also production from shallow 
offshore is expected. With the new YTF production rates above 2500 MMCFD is expected until 2031 
(Ref.  Figure  62).  The  details  in  these  expected  YTF  by  BAPEX  and  the  assumptions  behind  the 
impact on the strategic reserve forecast are not available to the Consultants. Most important is to 
know the reserve status used and the risking that is attached to the estimates. Assuming, however, 
that it represents 2P reserves with a 70% recovery, the fields reflect GIIPs between 3.9-2.8 tcf.  
 
The gas demand forecasted by the Consultants shows that gas demand will not be lower than 4000 
MMCFD  from  2017  and  on.  For  this  it  is  clear  that  the  Scenario  B  will  thus  never  meet  the  gas 
demand and that the supply gas will exceed 1000 MMCFD growing to more than 2000 MMCFD from 
2019 (Ref. Figure 63, BAPEX Forecast).

5.3.3  Case C – Proven, Probable and Possible (3P) Reserves with 34 tcf YTF contribution 
The YTF potential in Bangladesh is evaluated in Section 5.3.4. The analysis shows that there is a 
significant YTF resource available in the country. The resource is available both as conventional gas 
but also thin-bed resources at existing fields. As reviewed in Section 5.1, an ambitious exploration 
program has been approved by the Government of Bangladesh and is currently being implemented 
by Petrobangla and its subsidiaries. Based on these initiatives, the Consultants find that a scenario 
with a higher YTF contribution than presented in Scenario B is justified. 
 
The historical data from Bangladesh demonstrate that with a drilling rate of 1-2 exploration wells 
per year an average GIIP growth rate of 500 bcf was achievable. This was obtained with an uneven 
yearly drilling rate. The exploration success was also unevenly distributed over the past 60 years 
(Ref. Figure 56 and Figure 57). The basic assumption in Scenario C is that a structured and well-
planned  exploration  strategy  can  increase  the  average  GIIP  growth  rate  well  above  500  bcf  per 
year.   
 
As LNG import has been sanctioned by the government, the demand for accelerated indigenous 
gas supply is to some extend relaxed. This can leave time for in-depth G&G work before seismic 
acquisition and drilling campaigns are executed. A beneficial balance between pace and preparatory 
work can be met.  
 
On  the  short  term,  the  Consultants  acknowledge  the  announced  5  years  exploration  drilling 
campaign by BAPEX, but stress that the drilling operations must be prioritised based on a qualifying 
G&G work program.  
 
  
 
  
112 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
the Consultants recommend starting with the low risk areas, i.e. areas with a proved petroleum 
system  and  then  work  around  to  more  frontier  areas.  A  constant  evaluation  on  the  volume  of 
available drilling rigs and G&G staffs in general must be taken in order to avoid any bottle-neck 
issues.  Further  details  and  assumptions  for  the  YTF  potential  are  presented  in  Section  5.3.4.  In 
Figure 64 the “BAPEX New” production is included in the different “YTF areas” and in to the “thin 
bed” production.

section 5.3.4 below

5.3.4  Yet to Find Resources (YTF) 
The existence and advanced geological analysis of yet to find resources by two independent sources 
“USGS-Petrobangla Joint Study dated 2001” and “Final Updated Report on Bangladesh Petroleum 
Potential and Resource Assessment 2010” by Gustavson (2011) allow The Consultants to review 
the  yet-to  find  resources.  The  Consultants  also  place  emphasis  on  the  discussion  on  the  YTF 
presented in the report “Bangladesh Gas Sector Update”. 
 
The GSMP (2006) included a review of the various YTF Gas Resource methodologies and the reader 
is  directed  to  this  report  and  the  report  by  Gustavson  (2011)  for  further  in-depth  analysis  of 
methodology.  The  USGS-Petrobangla  (2001)  study  is  a  systematic  and  extensive  study  that 
represents  the  earliest  and  best  study  to  assess  the  Bangladesh’s  undiscovered  gas  resource 
potential. This study determines that the undiscovered gas resources of Bangladesh range from 8 
tcf (95% probability) to 66 tcf (5% probability) with a 50% probability of finding 29 tcf and a mean 
of 32 tcf.  
 
  
 
  
113 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study by Gustavson (2011) provides the current most updated and best document study to 
evaluate the YTF resource for this report. The existing producing fields occur for the most parts 
within the Eastern Fold Belt but a potentially prospective area also exist in the Western Fold Belt 
in addition to shallow and deep offshore areas (Ref. Figure 65). In Gustavson study mapped leads 
and prospects are presented together with unmapped prospects. The risked resource is estimated 
to range between 34 tcf (90% probability) to 80 tcf (10% probability). In additionl to this estimate, 
conventional resource and unconventional resource is expected to be present in Bangladesh and is 
estimated to range between 4 tcf and 19 tcf (Table 18).

For the purpose of supply planning the recommendation in the GSMP (2006) study was that the 
P95 YTF resource estimate should be used. At that time this estimate amounted to 8.4 tcf.  
 
In this updated GSMP, The Consultants recommend that the P90 YTF estimate of 34.5 tcf provided 
by Gustavson (2011) should be used given its more detailed nature of the study. Further, it is not 
the scope of the present update of the gas master plan to present a new and exhausting resource 
assessment for Bangladesh. The Consultants assess the volumetric probability resource estimate 
of Gustavson (2011) to be the present best update.  
 
In order to unlock this potential, the prospect inventory compiled by Gustavson (2011) needs to 
be explored systematically in order to prove up the potential undiscovered volumes. This needs to 
be done on an ongoing basis to ensure that the potential resource is converted into proved reserves 
and developed in time to meet the supply shortfall, especially since the YTF resource has an even 
greater level of uncertainty than possible reserves (3P).  
 
In  addition  to  the  Total  Prospective  Resources  (Table  18),  Gustavson  (2011)  also  provides 
estimates on the Thin-Bed-Resources at existing fields (Ref. Table 19). This resource varies from 
0 tcf (90% probability) to 27 tcf (10% probability). The resource is thus potentially significant but 
with  much  higher  uncertainties  than  the  prospective  YTF  resources.  In  the  long  term  strategic 
planning,  this  resource  should  therefore  not  be  considered.  Nevertheless,  it  illustrates  that 
additional potentials exist for future field developments and field tie-in. Exploration here will see if 
this resource can be un-locked and turned into proven resources.

In addition to conventional resources, unconventional shale gas and coal bed methane amounts 
to 4 tcf (P90) according to the studies by Gustavson (2011). These resources are currently not 
included in the strategic forecast but a study named “Feasibility study for the extraction of coal 
bed methane (CBM) at Jamalganj Coal field” showed that resource is not likely available at 
economic scale.

YTF resource and sectoring of Bangladesh 
The  YTF  resource  estimate  provided  by  Gustavson  (2011)  did  not  allow  for  a  geographical 
subdivision of the P90 estimate of 34 tcf. Such geographical breakdown of the YTF was provided 
by  the  USGS  (2001)  study.  This  study  clearly  shows  that  the  most  prospective  areas  are  the 
geological stretches where the existing fields are located. Here, the geological structuring of the 
subsurface allows for well-defined relatively large four-way closures. In areas to the west of the 
country, the geological structuring is less pronounced leading to less distinct closures.  
 
The current exploration activities are reflected in the licencing currently taken (Ref. Figure 54) and 
in the seismic data coverage (Ref. Figure 55). This shows that part of the country has had a long 
exploration history whereas other parts are almost virgin territories.  
 
To reflect the two above characteristics of Bangladesh, the country has been divided into seven 
sectors (Ref. Figure 66). The definitions and basis characteristics are presented below and in Table 
21. 
 
Timing  and  planning  of  future  exploration  activities  in  Bangladesh  are  crucial  for  a  successive 
indigenous gas reserve growth. The Consultants take a deterministic approach using the already 
gained exploration and development experiences. As the P90 estimate from Gustavson (2011) is 
risked  resource  estimate,  the  Consultants  evaluated  the  probability  of  success  (PoS)  for  the 
different areas and use the PoS to setup timing for exploration planning (Table 20).    
 
Table 22 presents a recommended time-frame for exploration activities for the YTF areas in the 
short- and mid-term time interval. Prioritisation and timing are crucial for the success of discovering 
and developing new prospects and plays with respect to the limited resources available (number 
of drilling rigs etc.). The Consultants have prioritised the different areas A – G in Figure 66, rating 
the areas with the lowest exploration risk the highest priority.   
 
The  time-frame  is  developed  knowing  that  the  near  future  gas  supply  for  Bangladesh  involves 
import of LNG. This gives a unique opportunity for planning G&G work in a timely matter, so future 
seismic acquisition surveys and drilling campaigns can be done on a prioritised list of prospects.

Description of the YTF areas:  
 
Area A:  
Located onshore and includes most of the producing fields. Potential for rapid new resource 
to come on stream are thin-beds (1-3 tcf) and near field exploration (1-3 tcf) that may be 
tied-in within existing infrastructure. Furthermore, 3-5 tcf (P90) of additional YTF that may 
come relatively quick on stream (5-10 years). The PoS for the thin beds are 30% due to 
the risk of missing seals. For new explorations, Area A has a proven petroleum system and 
an  assessed  low  risk  for exploration  (PoS  =  33%).  An  overall  recovery  factor  of  70%  is 
projected, but thin beds will have a substantially lower expected recovery (20%). 
 
Area B:  
Located onshore and includes most of the remaining producing fields not in Area A. It has 
a proven petroleum system and low risk for exploration (PoS = 31%). It has expected 4-6 
TCF (P90) of YTF that may come relatively quick on-stream (7-12 years). Potential for rapid 
new  resource  to  come  on  stream  are  thin-beds  (1-3  tcf)  together  with  Area  A  and  near 
field exploration that may be tied-in within existing infrastructure. A recovery factor of 70% 
is projected. 
 
Area C:  
Located shallow offshore and contains previous production fields. It has a proven petroleum 
system  and  low  risk  for  exploration  (PoS  =  31%)  and  is  currently  under  exploration  by 
IOC. It has expected 4-6 TCF (P90) of YTF that may come relatively quick on-stream (5-
10  years)  if tie  back  to  existing  Sangu  field is  possible,  otherwise  a  timeframe  of  10-15 
years. A recovery factor of 70% is projected. 
 
Area D: 
Located onshore. It has no producing fields and a medium risk for exploration. Currently 
under exploration by BAPEX (PoS = 23%). It has expected 4-6 TCF (P90) of YTF that may 
come on stream (10-20 years) from now. A recovery factor of 70% is projected. 
 
Area E: 
Located onshore. It has no producing fields and a high risk for exploration since a working 
petroleum  system  has  not  been  proven  (PoS  =  13%.  Currently  the  area  is  not  under 
exploration. It has expected 4-6 TCF (P90) of YTF that may come on-stream (15-20 years) 
from now. A recovery factor of 70% is projected. 
 
Area F:  
Located shallow offshore. It has no producing fields and a high risk for exploration since a 
working  petroleum  system  has  not  been  proven  (PoS  =  13%.  Currently  the  area  is  not 
under exploration. It has expected 2-3 TCF (P90) of YTF that may come on-stream (15-20 
years) from now. A recovery factor of 70% is projected. 
 
  
 
  
119 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Area G: 
Located deep offshore. It has no producing fields, but newly discovery in block DS-12 prove 
up a working petroleum system (PoS = 31%). Only limited information was available from 
this area to the Consultants. YTF may come on stream (15-25 years) from now. The long 
development period is due to the deep offshore configuration. A recovery factor of 70% is 
projected. 
 
Production profile including the YTF areas is presented in Figure 64. 
 
For Area A, B and C the main structure is already drilled and new play types and testing of other 
types of accumulation have to be made. It is recommended to perform semi-regional studies to 
also  include  exploration  models  from  neighbouring  India.  Full  utilisation  of  acquired  3D  seismic 
data should be made.  
 
For Area D and E there is relatively spars data coverage by 2D regional lines and need for collection 
of 3D seismic data of structures is urgently needed to be able to make a prioritised prospect list 
for drilling selection for this sector.

5.4  Review of GSPM 2006 
In 2006, the GSMP depicted a scenario in which peak gas production will occur 10 years ahead i.e. 
in 2015-2017 (Ref. Figure 67). According to their models, the peak gas would be followed by rapid 
production decline of the existing fields. According to the models and best judgments at that time, 
peak production was anticipated to be slightly above 2500 MMcfpd. This production level was not 
anticipated if the difficult 3P reserve of existing fields was converted to Proved reserves and if not 
a significant amount of new production from YTF fields was put on stream (Ref. Figure 67).  
Figure 67: Demand Case A – Production Forecast, from GMSP (2006). 
 
 
The analysis provided by the Consultants has shown that the models and expectations with regard 
to peak gas timing and level of production forecasted in 2006 was remarkably true. However, our 
analysis  shows  that  the  conversion  of  3P  reserves  to  Proved  reserved  and  the  additional  of  YTF 
field  to  be  produced  after  depletion  of  existing  fields  will  not  be  sufficient  to  meet  the  future 
demands in gas.  
 
To maintain a high degree of domestic production requires a strong exploration commitment.  
The  Consultants  can  see  that  there  is  a  strong  awareness  of  the  importance  of  showing  due 
diligence with respect to finding new resources. The Bangladesh Government has made an action 
plan  towards  2021  to  raise  the  exploration  activities  since  the  lack  of  reserve  growth  is  a 
consequence of reduced exploration activities - activities that were greatly reduced in the crucial 
time after 2002.  
 
All evidence suggests that there is large YTF resources both offshore and onshore Bangladesh. As 
it  takes  about  7  years  for  a  discovery  to  be  turned  on  stream,  these  resources  cannot  help  the 
current  gas  supply  shortage  and  hence  the  need  of  LNG-terminal  capacity  will  be  important  in 
securing that future demands in gas can be reached.

5.5  Analysis of the exploration program by public sector 
Many recent discoveries have been made within the last decade but none of significant size. The 
historical high success rate for discoveries in Bangladesh may suggest that easy predictable field 
have been in focus. However, future exploration success will depend on unlocking more difficult 
settings and plays. The field size structure in Bangladesh favours many small fields and only few 
mid to large fields exist. The historical GIIP growth has been 500 bcf per year obtained from 1-2 
exploration drilling per year. It is recommended that Petrobangla prioritises target structures that 
may have higher risked GIIP volumes preferentially in order to reserve growth to speed up. The 
ranking of to-be-drilled structures should be made based on a risking process that documents the 
uncertainties associated with the GIIP estimate.  
 
The Consultants have not seen a list of risked GIIP structure aimed with the 53 exploration wells 
that are mentioned to be drilled within the years to come. Specifically, The Consultants recommend 
targeting a risked field size that lies within the P30 range of current fields. This may raise the ratio 
of unsuccessful drilling but will also lead to higher growth rate of GIIP vs time. Furthermore, this 
will also ensure a more restricted spending of development costs to fewer but perhaps larger fields 
that ultimately may provide higher resources per well successfully placed in the field.  
 
The Consultants acknowledge the ambitious exploration program committed by the Government of 
Bangladesh  but  find  based  on  the  drilling  history  and  on  the  fact  that  carefully  geophysical  and 
geological (G&G) work has to be made in planning and selection for each drill location that focus 
should not be on the drill number but rather on the quality of the prospect evaluation and section 
criteria.  
 
Seismic data 
To shoot non-exclusive seismic for the offshore area, it is very important to open up for activities. 
The Consultants urge for speeding up the process.  
 
It is the Consultants’ general understanding that 3D seismic data have been acquired over all major 
fields. The Consultants have, however, not seen the data or evaluation reports on the value gained 
from  the  studies.  Apart  from  field  optimisation,  the  evaluation  of  this  data  set  is  important  for 
identification of near field exploration. 
 
Drilling  
The number of drill rigs onshore are now three with one planned to be acquired. These numbers of 
rigs may be too few to allow for the needed high number of exploration and development wells to 
be  drilled.  Petrobangla  has  ensured  that  drill  rigs  will  be  optimally  operated  but  also  that  drill 
expertise from elsewhere is mobilised to ensure that the ambitious exploration is not halted.  
 
However, it is important that exploration wells are drilled from a carefully prepared and prioritised 
list. Preparing the needed work and selecting drill site for a high degree of wells will demand very 
skilled  work.  Focus  should  be  on  reserve  growth  rather  than  well  drilled.  Time  to  prepare  new 
prospect models inspired by recent successes as wells as successes in neighbouring countries is 
  
 
  
124 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
well  spent.  Preparing  of  semi-regional  studied  involving  all  stakeholders  in  Bangladesh  is 
recommended to help in keeping a high level in the prospect-to-drill inventory. 
 
5.6  Analysis of the exploration program by private sector 
The YTF resource in Bangladesh is significant and most likely at least of similar size order of what 
is currently under production. Significant investments are, however, needed to develop these new 
assets. Given the expected decline in current production and expected dependence on LNG,  energy 
related activities are needed in many parts of Bangladesh. As a consequence, the private sector 
exploration activities and its investment will be an increasingly important component in the future 
development of the gas sector in Bangladesh. Moreover, the activities and work-knowledge from 
this sector is likely to have a positive stimulation on the public-sector activities.  
 
The  results  of  the  licence  rounds  clearly  show  that  the  interest  in  the  areas  is  real  and  widely 
acknowledged by IOC. The efforts in acquiring non-exclusive 2D seismic coverage on a large part 
of the offshore area by Petrobangla are the first very important step to attract IOC and to enable 
local  efforts  to  evaluate  the  area.  It  is  the  Consultants’  judgment  that  better  delineation  of  the 
structures and thus of the potential GIIP will help gaining a common understanding between the 
Bangladesh Government and IOC in signing for PSC for Block areas. 
 
5.7  Key recommendations for gas supply augmentation 
Based  on  the  analysis  of  the  existing  producing  fields  in  Bangladesh  and  the  exploration  -  and 
development programmes for the country – the Consultants assess the potential for an increase in 
indigenous gas supply to be high and to be a valuable contribution to the overall gas demand/supply 
balance.  
 
The  Consultants  find  the  following  recommendations  essential  for  the  realisation  of  the  future 
indigenous gas supply:  
 
Production augmentation from existing fields possible by increasing number of wells and 
well completions in producing zones. New well must have increased tubing size and 
deviated wells must be considered in low permeability formations. 
 
 
  State of the art reservoir management, including both static and dynamic reservoir 
characterisation and modelling, is essential to optimize reservoir performance and 
securing high recovery. 
 
Field re-development should include an evaluation of thin-bed resources as well as 
deeper prospects to tie-in to existing infrastructure for early production.  
 
 
  Exploration potential still huge in Bangladesh; majority of the country unexplored but 
assessed to be hydrocarbon bearing. 
 
To unlock exploration potential, a systematically and risk based approach is necessary to 
best utilise resources; prioritised exploration campaigns opening in less uncertain areas 
and moving to more frontier areas.  
 
 
Intensified and focused E&P work calls for a systematic capacity building and human 
resource strengthening. A national plan for capacity building must be launched and 
prioritized; 
 
  
 
  
125 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  Mandatory to increase number of G&G expert staff to monitor and re-develop 
producing fields.  
o  Exploration and development of new fields with state of the art technologies calls 
for interdisciplinary human capacities.  
Increase expertise in drilling techniques and well completions. 
Increase and strengthen cooperation between academia, national institutions and 
IOC for knowledge transformation and – experiences. 
o 
o 
 
  Mandatory to attract IOCs for investments and technology transferring to develop deep 
offshore areas. 
 
  Mandatory for the country to invest in multi-client and open seismic surveys to prepare 
for bidding rounds.  
 
  Consecutive bidding rounds to open up for new licences; processed and open data 
packages must be available for the applicants

6.  LEAST COST SUPPLY SOLUTION 
6.1  Overall supply and demand 
It is established in the previous chapters that the gas production from existing fields in 
Bangladesh is expected to start declining in coming years, while the demand is forecasted to be 2 
to 3 times of current level by 2041. If nothing is done, the demand-supply gap will continue to 
widen (illustrated below), forcing Bangladesh into a severe energy crisis.

To avoid such a scenario, it is necessary for Bangladesh to consider adding gas supply through 
both indigenous production enhancement and exploration, as well as imports via LNG and 
pipelines. LNG import, even FSRUs, will take some time to put into operation, thus there is likely 
to be a supply shortage in the short-term. In the long-term, significant additions to the 
indigenous supply are not likely to materialise until appropriate measures such as proper drilling 
programs and upgrade of human resource capacity have been achieved. We estimate this to be 
in the range of 6-8 years from today. However, the expected output will in all likelihood be higher 
than if the current short-term focused programs are maintained. The supply-mix strategy will be 
discussed in the later paragraphs. 
 
In this chapter, we will first present some indicative net costs of supply from Yet-To-Find (YTF) 
potentials in Bangladesh, imported gas through pipeline from Myanmar, and imported LNG. To 
make the cost comparisons meaningful, we consider the underlining net cost of gas to 
Bangladesh. For example, assuming the upstream gas price for some indigenous production is 
$10/mcf where the upstream tax and/or government profit share is $6/mcf, the net cost to 
Bangladesh will therefore only be $4/mcf. In contrast, if some imported gas costs $10/mcf, the 
cost to Bangladesh would be the entire $10/mcf.

As shown in Figure 69 above, in the USD60/bbl global oil market environment, the net costs of 
Bangladesh’s YTF potentials are estimated to be between USD0.9/mcf and $5.0/mcf, depending 
on the geological location. Meanwhile, the net costs of imported gas from Myanmar and 
international LNG are estimated to be USD5~6/mcf and USD5~11/mcf respectively. 
Notwithstanding the exploration risks and large volume uncertainties in the YTF gas resources, 
Bangladesh’s potential indigenous supply appears to be a more economical option than imports, 
and it should be explored and assessed in depth. 
 
The methods in deriving these indicative net costs of supply are as discussed in the sections 
below. 
 
6.1.1  Indigenous Supply – Yet-to-Find (YTF) Resources 
As discussed previously, there are still considerable gas potentials in the indigenous resources in 
Bangladesh. Based on historical data and references to both Bangladeshi and international 
projects, we have derived our assumptions (see Figure 71 and Figure 72 below) for new field 
discoveries/developments in Bangladesh. It shall be noted that there have been a lack of 
exploration and development activities in Bangladesh historically. Based on these limited data 
and reference, there are large uncertainties in our assumptions and they should be revised when 
more information becomes available.

There have been 26 gas fields in Bangladesh, with a P50 GIIP of 654 bcf and a Pmean (average) 
GIIP of 1,379 bcf. For the YTF resources, we assume that the discoveries have an average GIIP 
  
 
  
129 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
of 1,000 bcf for Area A-F, and an average GIIP of 2,500 bcf for Area G reflecting the expectation 
that only large prospects will be drilled in deep water blocks. This assumption consequently 
implies fewer explorations and discoveries in Area G than other areas. We also assume a 
Recovery Factor of 70% across all upstream acreages, a new generic field in Areas A-F will 
therefore produce 700 bcf of gas and a new generic field in Area G will produce 1,750 bcf of gas. 
For simplicity, no liquid productions are assumed for future discoveries. 
 
As discussed previously, we define the net cost of gas supply as the net cost to the country, 
excluding any taxes and profit shares taken by the government. This is also the net profit per 
unit of gas that an upstream investor needs to receive so that a project is attractive enough for 
them to invest. To calculate this, we assume the investment hurdle is met when EMV/E&A = 1, 
where: 
 
     EMV = Expected Monetary Value of the project for the investor 
            = PoS*(NPV10 of the project if successful) – (1-PoS)*E&A 
 
     PoS = Probability of Success 
 
     E&A = Exploration and Appraisal cost (incl. seismic)       
 
In essence, we assume that exploration and appraisal investments are made when the risk 
adjusted project value (EMV) is equal or greater than the exploration and appraisal cost (E&A). 
The net gas price required by the investor in this case can therefore be derived at this investment 
hurdle, this is also the economic net cost of supply to Bangladesh as mentioned above.  
 
It should also be recognised that the exploration risks and uncertainties in GIIP can change when 
more information becomes available after each additional exploration. The economic net cost of 
gas can therefore change accordingly. For example, if a 10tcf field is discovered in a deep-water 
block, it will likely increase the PoS and the expected size of potential discoveries in neighbouring 
blocks – the economic net cost of gas of these blocks will therefore go down accordingly. One 
practical implication of such scenario is that Bangladesh can design a highly competitive PSC in 
order to attract IOCs to invest in 2 or 3 of its offshore blocks, and the fiscal terms can be revised 
and tightened up for other blocks once a significant discovery is made.  
 
6.1.2  Import from Myanmar 
According to the EIA, most of Myanmar’s current gas output comes from four offshore basins: the 
Yadana, Yetagun, and Zawtika fields in the Moattama basin, and the Shwe field in the Rakhine 
Basin. 
 
Myanmar’s proved gas reserves have increased dramatically since 2012 (see Figure 73), thanks 
to large investments from IOCs in offshore exploration and appraisal programmes in the country. 
In 2016, Myanmar’s total proved gas reserve increased to 42 tcf (through new exploration and 
appraisal activities), six times as much as that of Bangladesh. For example, the state-run

Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) and Australian stakeholder Woodside Petroleum 
announced in 2016 the discovery of two large natural gas wells at opposite ends of the Rakhine 
Basin, in Block A-6 (Woodside 40%, Total 40%, MPRL 20%) and Block AD-7 (Daewoo 60%, 
Woodside 40%). It is worth noting that Block AD-7 is right next to Bangladesh’s deep-water 
block DS-12 which has been recently awarded to Daewoo International Corporation.

Most of Myanmar’s natural gas production is exported to Thailand and, more recently, to China. 
According to EIA, the natural gas exports to Thailand accounted for roughly three-quarters of 
Myanmar’s natural gas exports, totalled around 340 bcf/y (932 MMCFD) in 2015. Natural gas 
exports to Thailand are supplied from the Yetagun, Yadan, and Zawtika gas fields. The Zawtika 
project is the newest of Myanmar’s major offshore gas projects, with Thailand’s PTTEP launching 
commercial operations in the second half of 2014. The project exports natural gas to Thailand as 
well as serves Myanmar’s growing domestic market. 
 
  
 
  
132 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Meanwhile, the natural gas exports to China commenced in mid-2013 with the development of 
the first phase of the Shwe natural gas project in the Rakhine Basin. In 2015, the Shwe field 
produced over 182 bcf (500 MMCFD) of natural gas, and Myanmar exported about 138 bcf (378 
MMCFD) of gas to China by pipeline in the same year. 
 
Myanmar and China have constructed twin crude oil and gas pipelines running from Myanmar’s 
port of Kyaukphyu to Kunming in southwestern China. A consortium of Asian oil companies, 
including the China National Petroleum Corporation, commissioned the onshore natural gas 
pipeline with a capacity of 424 bcf/y (1,160 MMCFD) to carry exported gas from the Shwe gas 
project to China.  
 
Myanmar’s natural gas production is forecasted to rise as new offshore projects come online. The 
capacity of the China-Myanmar pipeline (784 MMCFD) is likely to be surpassed by additional gas 
production from these new field developments, creating spare gas (currently uncontracted gas) 
for potential export to Bangladesh. Such spare gas can be of significant size as IOCs in Myanmar 
continue making new discoveries and proving large reserves.

Based on our experience on projects in Myanmar, we estimate well-head price for Myanmar 
offshore gas to be around USD4~5/mcf in the USD60/bbl oil price environment. We estimate the 
Myanmar to Bangladesh transmission tariff to be max USD1/mcf, the gross cost of Myanmar gas 
for Bangladesh is therefore estimated to be around USD5~6/mcf. 
 
6.1.3  LNG  
Given the uncertainties and lead time in developing the indigenous supply and pipeline gas 
imports from Myanmar, LNG undoubted offers greater flexibility and security in gas supply for 
Bangladesh. However, LNG is also expected to be the most expensive option. 
 
  
 
  
133 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bangladesh can choose to source its LNG supply from both the spot market and long-term 
contracts (5~10 years). The spot market LNG price is determined by market dynamics, i.e. short-
term demand fluctuations and marginal cost of supply. Meanwhile, many long-term LNG 
contracts are directly linked to oil price (e.g. Japan Customs-cleared Crude (JCC)) and others are 
mostly based on US Henry Hub price; negotiations for some new project are said to be based on 
a hybrid of JCC and Henry Hub, e.g. new projects in Mozambique and Canada as well as 
contracts with portfolio sellers e.g. IOCs.    
 
Spot Market 
Figure 76: Spot LNG DES prices in Europe and Asia, USD/mmbtu 
 
Source: European Commission Quarterly Report on European Gas Markets, Q1 2017 
 
As shown in Figure 76, spot LNG prices are highly sensitive to global market conditions. For 
example, the spot LNG price in Japan was as high as USD20/mmbtu in February 2014 and 
plunged to only around USD4/mmbtu in early 2016, as a combined result of weak demand in 
Asia, increasing global supply, and the fall of oil price. Similar trends are also observed in Europe 
although less dramatic. 
 
During the 2016-2017 winter, Asian LNG prices rebounded to around USD9/mmbtu as a result of 
the cold weather, as well as a number of disruptions, including an outage at Train 1 of Australia's 
Gorgon facility lasting more than a month (from late November to early January). Prices fell back 
from February as demand weakened while Australian and US output continued to grow. 
 
The total global traded LNG reached a historical high in 2016 at 258 MT. A 13.1 MT increase from 
the previous year, according to IGU. There is a consensus in the market that the global LNG 
demand will continue to grow. However, such growth in demand is most likely to be outpaced by 
the increases in supply capacity up to 2020, as additional liquefaction capacities are scheduled to 
come on stream in Australia and US over this period.  
 
  
 
  
134 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
As a result of this persisted oversupply of LNG up to 2020, we expect the spot LNG price during 
this period to be around USD4~6/mmbtu at DES in Bangladesh, which gives USD5~7/mcf ex-
regas terminal.  
 
However, the spot LNG price beyond 2020 is difficult to forecast and subject to greater 
uncertainties. 
 
Long-term Contracts 
According to our market intelligence, major LNG buyers like Japan are currently able to secure 
long-term LNG supply at 11.5-12% to oil price for Delivered Ex Ship (DES) contracts, while such 
slope is 12.5% for smaller buyers like Pakistan. We expect Bangladesh to achieve similar terms 
as Pakistan with a price formula as the following: 
 
    LNG DES = 12.5%*Oil + 0.5 
 
The significant shale gas production in recent years has turned the US from an LNG import 
country to an LNG export country, with the first export project commissioned in early 2016. The 
pricing for such LNG is different from the conventional oil linked formula (Brent linked) but based 
on Henry Hub price instead. The LNG pricing formula for US gas can be expressed as below:  
 
    LNG DES = Henry Hub + Pipeline Tariff + Liquefaction Tariff + Shipping 
 
We assume the regasification tariff to be USD0.8/mmbtu for the LNG receiving terminals in 
Bangladesh. Adding this tariff to the LNG DES prices, we can estimate the ex-regasification 
terminal prices for the potential LNG arrives at Bangladesh.  
 
At USD60/bbl oil price environment, we calculate that an oil-linked LNG long-term contract costs 
Bangladesh USD9/mcf, whereas a Henry Hub based long-term contract costs USD10/mcf. We 
also assume that long-term contract LNG via India terminals to Bangladesh requires additional 
USD1/mcf for transmission, therefore it would cost USD10~11/mcf when it reaches Bangladesh.

It should be recognised that, as a new and relatively small LNG buyer, Bangladesh may be 
offered less favourable terms for long-term LNG contracts. To improve its negotiation position, 
we recommend Bangladesh to consider (i) making joint purchase agreements with its neighbour 
countries, (ii) balance its LNG supply portfolio with multiple suppliers, (iii) balance its LNG supply 
  
 
  
135 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
portfolio also with purchases from the spot market, and (iv) avoid destination clause in the long-
term contracts, so that Bangladesh has the flexibility to resell the LNG to other markets when 
there is no or less need for LNG or when there are markets where the gas price is higher. Any 
success in securing pipeline gas imports from Myanmar and other countries should also help to 
improve Bangladesh’s bargaining power in the LNG market. 
 
Traditional LNG long-term contracts tend to cover 20 years at large volumes. However, new LNG 
buyers tend to sign for much shorter-term contracts at smaller volumes (see Figure 77), due to 
the uncertainties in the gas demand as well as upstream exploration in their respective countries. 
Such approach can also be adopted by Bangladesh to create greater flexibilities.

6.2  Short-term Strategy (2017 – 2021) 
In the short term, it is clear that the only secured option to increase supply is LNG imports. There 
can be additional production from thin bed sections of the existing fields as well some new 
discoveries in Bangladesh, however, such potential productions are coupled with significant 
uncertainties. It is also clear that the LNG import through Excelerate and Summit (1,000 MMCFD 
total capacity, assuming 800 MMCFD maximum average throughput) will still not be sufficient to 
meet the demand.

Therefore, the Consultants support additional LNG regasification terminals to be commissioned by 
2021 where possible, e.g. Reliance FSU (500 MMCFD).  
 
As discussed, long-term LNG contracts are linked to oil price, while the spot LNG price is likely to 
be kept low up to 2020 due to the oversupply situation in the global market; hence spot LNG is 
likely to offer more competitive prices during this period. Therefore, the GSMP Consultants 
recommend Bangladesh to import maximum quantity of LNG as its infrastructure allows, with 
majority of the LNG to be purchased from the spot market while small quantity from long-term 
contracts, creating a price and risk adjusted portfolio.   
 
It needs to be recognised that the gas demand of Bangladesh is unlikely to be fully met during 
this period, due to infrastructure (LNG terminals and Transmission system) limitations. However, 
the development of infrastructures should be given high priority in order to avoid persistent 
infrastructure bottlenecks in the medium and long term.

In the medium term, more gas can be imported through additional LNG regasification terminals 
in Bangladesh as required. In addition, Bangladesh can make connections to LNG terminals in 
India, utilising spare capacities of these terminals. If such pursuit with India is successful, the 
southwestern region of Bangladesh can benefit from an accelerate gas supply at a large volume. 
There can also be additional indigenous gas production if Bangladesh is successful in exploring its 
yet-to-find resources. 
 
Moreover, Bangladesh can also greatly benefit from gas imports (via pipeline) from Myanmar, if it 
can successfully secure gas contracts from new discoveries in Myanmar. The Consultants also 
recommend the Bangladesh authorities to pursuit pipeline gas imports from Iran and 
Turkmenistan, although there are many challenges and the negotiations and developments can 
be a gradual and slow process. Nevertheless, successes in securing pipeline gas imports will likely 
to offer Bangladesh more affordable prices, as well as strengthen its negotiation power in LNG 
purchase.     
 
Given the inherent uncertainties in the yet-to-find resources in Bangladesh, we recommend a 
flexible approach in sourcing its gas imports. For example, Bangladesh can negotiate for shorter 
contract length and flexibility in volumes for its long-term LNG contracts, so that it can easily 
reduce the level of LNG imports if indigenous gas explorations turn out to be very successful. 
Similarly, more pipeline gas and LNG imports should be pursuit if the early signs of indigenous 
gas explorations do not appear encouraging. 
 
As discussed previous, the oversupply situation in the global LNG market may start to change 
after 2020, which in turn affects the price differentials in spot LNG and long-term contracted 
LNG.  The Consultants therefore recommend Bangladesh to keep fine tuning the balance of its 
LNG portfolio in order to minimise its spending.  
 
From a financial prospective, it could be rewarding for Bangladesh to invest more in its 
indigenous gas potentials, if there are not enough IOC investments. Looking at this in context, if 
long-term contracted LNG costs Bangladesh around USD10/mmbtu at ex-regasification terminal, 
the purchase of LNG at 800mmcf/d (0.3tcf/yr) will cost over USD3 billion for a single year. Such 
amount of money could be used to finance large exploration and development programmes both 
onshore and offshore, where significant yet-to-find potentials are expected.  
 
Bangladesh can also consider acquiring interests in projects from where it imports its gas, 
favourable acquisition costs can be achieved under current oil price. This could also help to hedge 
against possible high oil and LNG prices in the future, as Bangladesh would be buying gas from 
its own oversea assets. 
 
6.4 
Long-term Strategy (2031 – 2041) 
Our recommendation for the long-term strategy is largely a continuation of the medium-term 
strategy.

However, as the demand for gas grows, it can be a practical challenge to import enough gas if 
little indigenous gas is developed. Take a somewhat extreme example, Scenario C forecasts 
Bangladesh’s gas demand to be 8,346 MMCFD (3 tcf) in 2041; assuming all of such demand is 
supplied with LNG, it will require 10~15 regasification terminals to be built in the limited region 
of Bangladeshi coast. The cost of such LNG import would also be significant: at USD10/mmBtu, it 
would cost Bangladesh more than USD30 billion in that year. 
 
Therefore, it re-enhances the recommendation for Bangladesh to pursuit rigorous exploration and 
development programmes on indigenous yet-to-find resources as well as pipeline gas imports. It 
needs to be recognised that these options have a longer lead time than LNG imports. Therefore, 
Bangladesh is recommended to start developing such options at the earliest possible date.   
 
 
Since the official submission of this Gas Sector Master Plan, Bangladesh has made speedy and 
impressive progress in its LNG import development, some of the key achievements are outlined 
in Appendix 9.

7.  TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN 
7.1  Gas transmission infrastructure planning 
Gas transmission planning in Bangladesh is moving from serving the indigenous production with 
demand mainly around Dhaka to a system based on combination of production and import of LNG 
and connections to India and Myanmar for import of gas.  
 
According to the scope of work, the main activities with respect to transmission system is to 
review and mature the following:  
“Transmission infrastructure plans of Petrobangla, GTCL and other state-owned 
 
entities, including inter alia issues to be addressed in the context of extension of 
network to the West and South Zone, including 
  Review of the identified options for incremental capacity expansion of the 
existing gas transmission infrastructure to cope with the projected growth in 
demand in the short-term 
  Review of the adequacy of the stand-alone pipeline projects to serve the 
demand of the so far un-served market, in particular supplies to new power 
plants and to the West and South Zone; and 
  Completion of spatial assessment of further expansion needs 
  Analysis should provide project-by-project details on CAPEX and OPEX, 
including the timelines needed to develop each segment of the infrastructure” 
 
As part of the work, the GSMP Consultant has worked with GTCL to obtain information and obtain 
access to plans and feasibility studies. The GSMP Consultant got access to operational reports for 
the recent years and three feasibility reports. Further, the GSMP Consultant worked with the 
GTCL experts on pipeline studio flow model for steady state simulation of the transmission 
system.  
 
In comparison with the GSMP 2006, there has been an increase in production and consumption of 
gas. This means that Bangladesh has moved to another league with respect to gas infrastructure 
and instead of smaller pipelines connecting fields and consumption, there should now be a focus 
on creating a major backbone connecting the new LNG import terminals with the existing system 
and allow space for future growth. Whereas the GSMP 2006 was much focused on recommending 
compressor stations to help bringing the domestic production from north to south, the present 
plan is more tilted towards increase in pipeline transmission capacity and hereby also creating 
line-pack for short term intraday storage.  
 
The proposed transmission plan is guided and developed by the following principles and 
parameters: 
 
1.  Need for flexibility of the system as the future production and import mix is uncertain. The 
system should hence be developed with a high focus on flexibility.

2.  High gas demand in comparison to area – Bangladesh gas consumption by area is in line with 
Germany and already three times higher than France and Denmark. Within the planning 
period, the gas density will become in line with UK and Japan in the medium term and The 
Netherlands in the long term. Location of demand is uncertain which suggests large diameter 
pipelines as it would make it possible to connect new consumers.  
3.  High cost of land and hereby high cost for right-of-way, which will favour large diameter 
pipelines and offshore pipelines. 
4.  Technically, the main challenges are crossing of rivers, flooding and environmental impact. 
5.  Relatively constant gas consumption over the year as compared to countries using gas for 
heating. This ensures a high utilisation of gas pipelines and focus should therefore be on gas 
pipelines rather than compressors, which will have a high operational cost if market prices 
shall be paid for fuel gas. 
6.  Need to meet demand in all parts of the country, in particular the Western and Southern part 
of the country.  
7.  Integration with India and Myanmar, and hereby ensuring the possibility for import of gas.  
 
7.2  Natural gas transmission fundamentals 
 
Gas transmission – economics of scale 
 
The foreseen increase in Bangladesh gas demand makes it possible to achieve 
economics of scale to bring down unit transmission cost. So far, the largest 
installed pipeline in Bangladesh is 36”, while 42” pipelines are planned. For 
comparison, the largest onshore pipelines normally used in Europe are up to 
56”. However, for practical reasons the pipeline diameter is often limited to 48”.  
 
In Bangladesh, the main technical hindrance for use of large diameter pipelines 
will be the crossing of rivers by horizontal drilling. Here it is possible to have 
difference in diameter between crossings and the rest of the system, which will 
require additional valve stations and pig launchers/receivers.  
 
The economics of scale is due to the difference in capacity and cost as function 
of diameter. The capacity of a pipeline is proportional with D^2.5, while the cost 
is almost proportional with the diameter. Consequently, the largest possible 
diameter pipelines will be the preferred solution if the capacity can be used. 
Even if the pipeline capacity is not fully used during the initial years, there will 
be advantages as less use of compressors and line-pack.

Transmission and line pack – a dynamic approach for short term storage  
 
The main purpose of the transmission pipelines is to transport gas from entry to 
exit points in the integrated system. However, due to the interday variation in 
the gas consumption with highest electricity consumption and production during 
the evening, there is not a constant flow in the system. In order to maintain a 
constant production from gas fields, it is therefore necessary with short term 
storage of gas. This is also provided in the pipelines by increasing pressure 
during night and decreasing during day and evening.  
 
The line pack capacity ensures the short-term storage for variation in 
consumption during the day. The maximum line pack capacity is: 
 
Line pack (max) = volume of the gas pipeline system * Max-Min operational 
pressure 
 
As an example, a 42” pipeline with 100 km length will have a line-pack capacity 
of approx. 100 mmscf, assuming a pressure difference between 100% and 50% 
of design pressure. A 24” pipeline will only have a third of this line pack 
capacity.  
 
 
 
 
Design and operational pressure  
 
The Bangladesh gas transmission system has in general been designed for an 
operational pressure of 1000 psig. The new system is designed for 1135 psig (78 
bar). This is in line with some European countries, while some new European 
pipelines are designed for higher pressure up to 1500 psig. In view of the 
interconnection with the existing gas transmission system in Bangladesh, we find 
it reasonable to use 1135 psig. For offshore pipelines it will be possible to use 
higher pressure, up to 2000 psig or more.

Gas or electricity transmission – balance between power and gas 
master plan 
 
New power plants are one of the drivers for new gas transmission projects, as 
the alternative is to locate power plants close to the gas sources and transport 
electricity with higher losses. To illustrate the choice between power and gas 
transmission; 
-  42” pipeline – capacity 1000 mmscf/day – 15,000 MW 
-  400 kV AC overhead line 500-1000 MW 
 
Assuming an efficiency of 50 percent for a power plant, it will hence require 
up to 15 overhead lines to transport the same amount of energy as a 
large diameter gas pipeline.  
 
For Bangladesh this is relevant for the location of the power plant when starting 
import of LNG. Should the power plants be located close to the LNG import or 
should gas be transported to power plants distributed over the country.  
 
In the PSMP2016, a number of power plants are foreseen close to the LNG 
import as no certainty was given for gas transmission. The aim of this update of 
the gas sector master plan is to create sufficient gas transmission capacity to 
secure a distributed location of power plants.  
 
In the overall economic optimisation, the cost of gas and electricity transmission 
should be combined and optimally a combined plan should be developed. As this 
is outside the scope for the present study, the aim has been to give flexibility 
with respect to location of power plants.

Onshore versus offshore gas pipelines 
 
Bangladesh has the possibility to install offshore pipelines in combination with 
onshore pipelines. This includes connection to offshore field development on 
shallow and deep water, but also offshore pipelines in parallel to the coast from 
the LNG import terminals to the Western part of Bangladesh.  
 
The advantages of offshore pipeline versus onshore are that it can be shorter and 
can be designed to higher pressure. Further, the offshore gas pipeline can be 
used as a manifold for future connections of offshore gas fields.  
 
The advantages of onshore pipelines are that there is less need for advanced 
offshore installation equipment and that onshore gas pipelines can be looped in 
sections as the need occurs. In any case, one onshore pipeline is needed to 
supply the gas consumers along the coast from LNG import to Chittagong and 
further to the centre of the country.  
 
 
 
 
Land acquisition and Right of Way 
 
Land acquisition and Right of Way constitutes significant part of pipeline cost. 
Examples available show a range from 15 to 40 % for different diameters of 
pipelines. Typically, the need for land is not much different for different diameter 
pipelines, which gives incentives to install large diameter pipelines.  
 
 
 
 
7.3  Underground gas storage, small scale LNG and biogas 
 
7.3.1  Underground gas storage  
With the introduction of LNG, there will be increased dependence of external gas supply and of 
the weather conditions. It can be expected that the LNG terminals will only be operational 
between 80 and 90 percent of the time.  
 
Underground gas storage of larger onshore LNG storage can ensure the continuous supply of gas. 
One of the options is to convert existing gas production fields to underground gas storage. This 
can be on- or offshore gas fields.  
 
As an example, the offshore Sangu gas field could be converted to underground gas storage. In 
this case, compressors and process facilities could be located onshore. Hereby, the compressors 
  
 
  
144 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
can be used for normal line compression when not used for injection into the storage. The 
feasibility of such gas storage should of course be investigated before any decision, to date we 
are not aware of any relevant studies. 
 
The cost of conversion of the offshore gas field to underground gas storage is assessed in the 
order of 200 m USD. There is a need to develop the concept before accurate numbers can be 
given.  
 
Underground gas storage has not been explicitly modelled in pipeline studio. 
 
7.3.2  Small scale LNG 
When LNG import is established, it will be possible also to use small scale LNG for peak load 
plants in the western part of the country and for supply to part of the country not yet connected 
by pipeline. This can be done by barge transportation along the rivers. As an example, it will be 
possible to use LNG barges to transport gas to Khulna for peak load supply and hereby obtain a 
better utilisation of the overall pipeline system. LNG can also be used for ship and heavy road 
transport.  
 
Small scale LNG has not been explicitly modelled in pipeline studio. 
 
7.3.3  Biogas 
Biogas may become a considerable gas supply in Bangladesh. In some European countries up to 
10 percent of gas supply is coming from biogas produced on manure, wood or other sources. In 
Bangladesh the infrastructure is still lacking and no input is taken into account in the modelling 
and planning.  
 
7.4 
Existing and planned gas transmission system  
 
7.4.1  Existing system  
The existing gas transmission system in Bangladesh has been developed over the last four 
decades based on the indigenous gas production and has grown organically by adding more new 
gas transmission pipelines and compressor stations.

Consequently, the system is most developed in the North-Eastern part of the country with 
connections to Dhaka, while the South and the West of the country has less developed gas 
transmission systems.  
 
Due to the historical development of the system, the pipeline dimensions are small, with most 
pipelines having a diameter of 30” and less. This system has suited the historical supply/demand 
  
 
  
146 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
situation with a total daily consumption of up to 2500 mmscf. The demand has been higher, but 
has not been served due to lack of supply.  
 
The challenge for the future gas transmission system is that the Bangladesh gas market will 
change in the following ways:  
  Growth in gas demand  
Import of natural gas, via:  
 
LNG import facilities located south of Chittagong at Moheshkhali 
o 
Import via pipeline from respectively: 
o 
-  Myanmar 
- 
India 
Location of new demand centres more evenly distributed over the country with new gas fired 
 
power plants and industries also in the South and Western part of the country 
 
As the demand of natural gas will increase in the coming years, there is a need to install large 
diameter gas pipelines in order to achieve economies of scale and limit the number of pipelines in 
order to take up less space.

The aims of these pipelines are to strengthen the connection from the future LNG terminals and 
to create connection to the West of the country. This also includes creation of an east-west 
connection.  
 
As described in the supply chapter about pipeline connections from Myanmar and India, there is a 
possibility to connect Bangladesh from Myanmar via the same pipeline which will be used for the 
LNG import. The most obvious connection from India will be in the western part of the country to 
Khulna from Haldia in India. Later on, there will be possibilities to connect with India in the 
North-West. 
 
In our analyses of the need for new gas transmission systems, we assume that the projects 
under implementation and proposed Table 24 and Table 25 will be implemented as planned. In 
some cases, our analyses show that larger diameter pipelines should be used than proposed by 
GTCL.

7.5 
Transmission system modelling  
The transmission model aims to evaluate the capacity of the existing pipelines network that is 
used to supply Bangladesh with gas. The model is also used as a tool in order to investigate new 
pipeline sizes and routings within Bangladesh.  
 
This investigation will make sure that from a technical stand point it is possible to meet the 
predicted increase of gas demand to different geographical areas within the Bangladesh gas 
transmission system. The model will fundamentally be used to run various scenarios on 
infrastructure based on the future gas demand and supply forecast.    
 
7.5.1  Simulation tool  
As the world standard for gas transmission system simulations, Pipeline Studio™, provides design 
and operations analysis for complex gas pipeline networks. A Pipeline Studio™ (gas) model for 
the country of Bangladesh’s current transmission system has been built together with GTCL.  
 
This includes the complex looped network system containing the multiple intakes from the 
individual gas fields, the main city gate delivery points, the major gas consumers as well as the 
compressor stations. The simulator incorporates advanced numerical solutions, detailed 
equipment modelling, and a graphical configuration environment as shown in the example in 
Figure 82.

This model is to be used for designing any new required pipelines, to give an overall hydraulic 
analysis of the system network and to give an analysis of alternative development scenarios in 
line with future projections.  
 
7.5.2  Model Input data 
The model was built in conjunction with GTCL where their engineers supplied the exact input data 
and information required to represent the current operating infrastructure.

7.5.3  Short term modelling with proposed new pipelines 2021  
The Consultants have performed an analysis of the gas transmission system for the foreseeable 
short term focusing on the proposed projects up until 2021 and using the The Consultants 
production and demand forecast for 2021 from the previous sections. It is to be noted that only a 
steady state analysis has been performed and in reality the system is dynamic. Details of the 
modelling assumptions are given below.  
 
Other model Assumptions: 
a)  The steady state is achieved by adding or increasing capacity wherever bottlenecks are 
identified.  
  
 
  
150 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
b)  Indigenous gas production is 2639 MMCFD; 
c)  Up to 1500 MMCFD of R-LNG is available at Moheshkhali; 
d)  Up to 500 MMCFD of R-LNG is potentially available from Odisha via a 70 km border 
pipeline with INDIA; 
e)  Total gas demand is 4610 MMCFD;   
f)  Gas fields can meet 1030 psig; 
g)  Gas is available via the cross-border connections at 1050 psig.       
 
The transmission system is able to operate and supply the following amount of gas to each 
region: 
Bakhrabad 
518 
Jalalabad 
482 
Karnaphuli 
657 
Pashchimanchal 
175 
Sundarban 
524 
Titas 
2254 
Total 
4610 
 
The first key finding in the short term is that with the transmission system as 2021 there will be 
challenges in meeting demand with a potential short fall of around 500 MMCFD. Theoretically, 
this shortfall could be spread out over the entire country. However, realistically, the shortfall in 
gas will be felt mostly at the end of the transmission system, specifically in Khulna in the SGCL 
franchise area, as gas either from the south east or from the north east would have to be 
transported across the country to reach the west. If this area is prioritised at the expense of 
another area, the Elenga compressor station would have to be turned on. The best solution for 
resolving the potential shortfall in volumes and corresponding transmission capacity has been 
identified and comprises of a pipeline from India (connection at Khulna), an additional 3rd LNG 
terminal in south east at Moheshkhali and a large onshore pipeline connection Moheshkhali to the 
west of the country via a system loop with pipelines from Langlband to Khulna.  
 
The GSMP Consultant recommends the pipeline from India to Khulna as this connection will 
increase system stability, security of supply, and strengthen the bargaining position of 
Bangladesh towards external suppliers. Given the supply and demand situation in 2021, we 
recommend a third LNG terminal at Moheshkhali. This will trigger a need for additional 
transmission capacity from Moheshkhali. It can be argued whether this should be an offshore or 
onshore pipeline solution. Ideally from a technical perspective, we would recommend the offshore 
pipeline; however, this will take more time to plan and execute. It is also most likely that the 
onshore pipeline can be completed in the short term and therefore given the urgency required for 
meeting the short-term demand capacity. It is recommended to pursue the onshore solution first. 
The onshore solution also has the advantage that it can be built in sections and that investment 
money largely stays within the country. However, the offshore pipeline is still to be required in 
the mid/long term strategy, so it is recommended to start feasibility studies immediately for this.

The second key finding of the short-term modelling is that if the India connection is not built, 
more volumes and capacity are needed which will need to come from the south east at 
Moheshkhali with a 4th LNG terminal (triggered by the additional volumes). With the current plans 
for LNG, the 4th terminal is likely to be a land-based terminal – in that case reaching completion 
by 2021 will be difficult. Alternatively, the volumes could be secured by connecting the 
transmission system with Myanmar (also from the south east); however, we also doubt this can 
realistically be achieved by 2021. In any case (Myanmar or a 4th LNG), the transmission capacity 
would need to be expanded.   
 
System optimisation and usage of existing compressor stations 
Finally, depending on the exact delivery demands and supply locations, it may be beneficial to 
lower the pressure at Ashuganj/Muchai compressor station in order to help the gas flow from the 
south east of the country to the west. A more detailed study is required to definitively determine 
this. 
 
Prepare the system for future growth – exploit economies of scale 
It will be essential for the supply of gas to the west that the 30” x 45 km pipeline Kutumbopur – 
Meghnaghat and the 30” x 140 km Langolbad – Gopalgonj pipelines are constructed. We 
recommend a higher capacity of the pipelines (36”) to accommodate future growth in gas 
demand. We would also recommend connecting Gopalgonj and Khulna to complete the first step 
of the transmission backbone also creating a system loop. The connection would serve as an 
important part of the major transmission backbone of the country and facilitate further 
expansions and connections of power plants. Without these investments, the ELENGA compressor 
must be turned on to supply the west of the country with 500 MMCFD. 
 
  
 
  
152 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Looking at demand post 2021, it quickly becomes evident that the pipelines suggested by GTCL 
are undersized to carry the volume further in the system. Thus, at this stage, we recommend 
installing larger dimensions pipelines to accommodate with future demand. Of course, for 
pipelines where materials have already been purchased or even installed this might prove to be a 
challenge. In these cases, we suggest carrying on as is.  
 
Short term gas transmission network development – 2021 
Based on the pipeline studio modelling combined with the need for gas transmission in the long 
term, The Consultants’ recommendations for the short-term network development will be the 
following pipelines and compressor stations in addition to the projects already under 
construction.

MEDIUM TERM (2031) TRANSMISSION SYSTEM MODELLING – SURGE IN DEMAND REQUIRES 
COMPLETION OF THE MAJOR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM BACKBONE 
The medium term (2031) has been modelled building upon the infrastructure included in the 
short term and the connection to India at Khulna. In between 2021 and 2031, we project an 
  
 
  
153 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
increase in demand from approximately 4500 MMCFD to just above 6500 MMCFD. On the 
domestic supply side, we would expect that some E&P results have been achieved between 2021 
and 2031 increasing the domestic production from 3000 MMCFD to 4800 MMCFD. These are 
uncertain figures and do of course rely on following the recommendations on the E&P. The import 
capacity has been set to allow up to 500 MMCFD from India (connection at Khulna). From the 
south east, we allow up to 2000 MMCFD. We do, however, on purpose not specify the source of 
the volumes from the south east as these can be achieved from either additional LNG, from 
Myanmar or from offshore domestic production. Time will show how these sources develop in 
feasibility and we find that keeping the flexibility to adjust is important and prudent.  
  
Large scale transmission capacity from Moheshkhali onshore and offshore required to 
facilitate import    
Regardless of the source of the gas volumes from the south east, we find that in order to meet 
the gas demand in the Titas, Pashchimanchal and Sundarban regions, the following projects must 
be completed: 
 
Offshore Pipeline between Moheshkhali and the “Langolbad – Gopalgonj/Khulna pipeline” 
We recommend a 36” x 150 km offshore pipeline and a 42” x 150 onshore between Moheshkhali 
and the Langolbad – Gopalgonj/Khulna pipeline. The actual routing of the pipeline will have to be 
adjusted to connection points to power plants and other large consumers as well to right-of-way 
and environmental constraints. The connection will apart from evacuating the gas form south 
east at Moheshkhali, strengthen security of supply not only in the western part of the country but 
in fact help the entire country as dependence on the narrow onshore corridor is reduced. To 
facilitate the transport further in the system, it is necessary that the diameter of the connecting 
Langolbad – Gopalgonj/Khulna pipeline is 36”.

Hatikumrul - Langolbad – Gopalgonj/Khulna pipelines 
As part of the backbone from south east to north west, we recommend that the offshore pipeline 
is continued (36” x 120 km) further to Hatikumrul in the north-western part of the country. The 
routing should preferably follow the existing transmission system.    
 
Finally, one intermediate compressor station is potentially required between Moheshkhali and 
Dhaka. A detailed study is required to definitively determine this.   
 
Medium term gas transmission network development 
The investments in the medium term will depend on the actual development of the indigenous 
gas production. However, in all cases, we foresee the need to strengthen the gas supply from the 
LNG import facilities and/or Myanmar, which is the nearest country with surplus gas production.  
 
Based on the pipeline studio modelling combined with the view of long term use of the gas 
transmission, the following investments are proposed. The actual of implementation will need to 
be adjusted as the market develops. Also, we have an underground gas storage in the period in 
order to allow for market integration and system balance which can facilitate import of gas but 
also ensure security of gas supply, better utilisation of LNG terminals and possible transit of gas 
from Myanmar to India.

LONG TERM (2041) TRANSMISSION SYSTEM MODELLING – UNCERTAINTY AHEAD FOCUS ON 
FLEXIBILITY AND KEEPING OPTIONS OPEN 
The situation in 2041 has so much uncertainty about the actual gas production, import via LNG 
and pipelines, as well as the actual location of gas consumption. Therefore, the GSMP Consultant 
has decided not to further attempt to get the model to converge for this year but instead 
envisions the design of a flexible system, which will be able to adapt to most of the uncertainty 
by creating a strong backbone of the gas transmission system from the LNG import terminals, 
south of Dhaka and further to the Western part of the country.  
 
As the import of gas supply increases, the indigenous gas production will increasingly be used 
close to the gas production or cease to exist in 2041. This situation may result in an operation 
where the pressure in the system close to production can be somewhat lowered and perhaps 
even the flows reversed. Further to the gas transportation, a system with large diameter 
pipelines will also be able to provide additional line pack flexibility to ensure gas demand 
variations during the day. To further increase flexibility and as back up for LNG supply in case of 
severe weather conditions, the Consultants also recommend converting an existing gas field to 
underground gas storage.  
Figure 85: High level Long Term Gas Transmission Plan5 
 
Source: Ramboll 
 
Post 2031, the GSMP Consultant estimates that there could be possibilities to get 
Turkmen/Iranian gas if the TAPI pipeline is constructed. Thus, an additional connection to India 
at Rngpur in the north is envisaged. The connection should also enable bidirectional flow allowing 
potential excess production from Myanmar to transit through Bangladesh to India. The length of 
                                               
5 The map shows the general envisioned back bone required for the long-term plan of the network. Exact sizes and routings should be 
studied further in feasibility studies but it is recommended at least one 42” pipeline connects the south east to the north west of the 
country and as large as possible pipelines should be implemented.      
  
 
  
156 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
the backbone from the Myanmar to the Indian border is approx. 500 km. It is recommended to 
develop this as a large diameter pipeline, even if such diameter is only required in the longer 
term to avoid investing in small diameter pipelines.  
 
In general, the system in Bangladesh has so short pipelines that intermediate compression is 
only necessary in few cases to ensure sufficient flow.  
  One intermediate compressor station between Moheshkhali and Dhaka – location suggested 
at Feni 
  Compressor station could be combined with offshore underground gas storage Sangu field – 
the feasibility of this should of course be investigated before any decision, to date we are not 
aware of any relevant studies.  
  Border station Myanmar 
  Border station India (Khulna) 
  Gas field compression – in particular when fields are being depleted 
 
In addition to line compressor stations, there maybe a need for field compressor stations when 
the production pressure becomes lower than the needed pipeline pressure. By using increased 
volumes close to the gas fields, it may be possible to lower the operational pressure of the 
pipelines closed to production.  
 
Long term gas transmission investments  
The long-term investments from 2032 to 2041 are difficult to break down into actual projects. 
However, some of the investments will include at least one large diameter pipeline extra from the 
LNG import point to Dhaka and further to the west as shown in Figure 8.

8.  REGIONAL GAS NETWORK  
8.1 
The regional Euroasian gas network and supply possibilities 
The Bangladesh gas system is at present isolated from other countries. As gas networks in Asia 
are being developed, it will be possible to integrate the Bangladesh gas network to neighbouring 
countries and hereby also to supply from countries with large gas reserves. Most obvious will be 
the integration with India and Myanmar. However, if such integration shall make sense, it is also 
important to view how these two countries are connected to the rest of Asia.  
 
In recent years, a number of major decisions on development on creation of an Euroasian gas 
market have been made, of which the more important are Myanmar-China pipeline, Myanmar-
Thailand pipeline, Turkmenistan- China pipelines and Russia-China pipelines. With the demand 
developments in Bangladesh, it would be obvious to connect Bangladesh with the gas 
transmission systems of the neighbouring countries.  
Figure 86: Pipeline infrastructure in the region 
 
 
The next big step in this development may be the TAPI pipeline between Turkmenistan and India 
via Afghanistan and Pakistan. Iran-India is another possibility, either via Pakistan or via Oman 
and an offshore pipeline between Oman and India.  
 
So far, the pipelines between Turkmenistan and Iran to India have been hold back due to lack of 
market in India. With a renewed increase in gas consumption in India and possible connection 
between India and Bangladesh there could be sufficient market for development of the pipelines.  
 
For Iran, which so far does not have any LNG facilities, the South Asian market is interesting as 
gas prices have fallen so much that development of greenfield LNG facilities for the time being 
are hardly economically viable. Also for Turkmenistan, which the South Asian market is an 
  
 
  
158 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
attractive alternative to the EU market (via Iran and Turkey) or China (via Kyrgistan, Kazakhstan 
and Uzbekistan) is an attractive solution, with ensured long term demand. Russia and India have 
recently announced the study for a Russia to India pipeline, either directly via Himalaya or via 
Iran and Pakistan. 
 
8.1.1  Tapi (international gas transmission pipeline) 
The Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India  pipeline  will  transport Caspian  Sea natural  gas 
from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan into Pakistan and  then  to India.  The  total  length  of  the 
TAPI pipeline will be 1,814 kms. A 214-km section of the pipeline will run through Turkmenistan, 
a 774-kilometer section will run through Afghanistan and an 826-kilometer section will run through 
Pakistan. The pipeline will be 56 inch diameter with a working pressure of 10,000 kPa. The capacity 
will  be  33 billion  cubic  metres  per  year  of  which  5 billion  cubic  metres  will  be  provided  to 
Afghanistan and 14 billion cubic metres each to Pakistan and India. Six compressor stations would 
be constructed along the pipeline. The pipeline is expected to be operational by 2019. 
 
8.1.2  India – Bangladesh – Myanmar gas pipeline (mbi pipeline) 
This  pipeline  project  has  been  conceived  under  the  Hydrocarbon  Vision  2030  for  North-eastern 
region and is planned to connect Chittagong, Bangladesh then Sitwe, Myanmar with north-eastern 
states. A lot of gas is burned in the north-east as it cannot be supplied due to lack of infrastructure. 
As  part  of  Hydrocarbon  Vision  2030  for  North-eastern  region,  6,900  km  pipelines  would  be  laid 
connecting  Sitwe  (Myanmar),  Chittagong  (Bangladesh),  most  north-eastern  states,  Siliguri  and 
Durgapur. Thirteen routes with a total length of about 6,900 km of pipelines have been proposed 
for the purpose.  
 
8.1.3  Russia – India gas transmission business & plans 
India  and  Russia  have  agreed  to  explore  building natural  gas  from  Siberia  to  India.  The  project 
envisions connecting the Russian gas grid to India through a 4,500-6,000km pipeline. The natural 
gas  produced  in  East  Siberian  fields  is  to  be  pumped  into  Russian  gas  grid,  which  would  be 
connected to India through the cross-country pipeline network. 
 
The shortest route will entail bringing the pipeline through Himalayas into northern India, a route 
which  poses  several  technical  challenges.  Alternately,  the  pipeline  can  come  via  Central  Asian 
nations,  Iran  and  Pakistan  and  into  Western  India.  However,  the  route  will  be  expensive  when 
compared to the long discussed but shorter and cheaper Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline. Tehran may 
suggest India take its gas through IPI rather than building such an expensive pipeline. 
 
8.1.4  Sage pipeline 
Based  on  the  discovery  of  Farsi  Block  gas  field  in  Iran  by  OVL,  India  has  already  planned  to 
transport the produced gas through pipeline or by means of LNG. Hence, India developed a master 
plan in early 2008 to transport the produced natural gas from Iran to India through subsea pipeline 
across the Arabian Sea & revalidated the same in 2010. This plan has been given to SAGE (South 
Asia Gas Enterprise Pvt. Ltd.) to develop further.  
 
  
 
  
159 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
SAGE  is  promoted  by  the  New  Delhi  based Siddho  Mal  Group, in  Joint  Venture  with  a  UK-based 
Deepwater Technology Company.  SAGE Pipeline Infrastructure plans to transport 8 TCF of Natural 
Gas over the next 20 years from the Gulf Region to the coast of India using the Deep-sea route. 
The pipeline passing through the Arabian Sea will reach depths of 3,400 metres under the sea and 
will have a length of approximately 1,300 kms.  
 
Qatar, Iran, Iraq and Turkmenistan together have enormous Natural Gas reserves to the tune of 
2,000  TCF  and  SAGE  plans  to  transport  some  of  this  to  India  through  its  Deepwater  Pipeline 
Infrastructure. The option of Gas Swaps between these nations is also being explored.  
 
8.1.5  Jagdishpur-Haldia gas transmission pipeline (Gail) 
Jagdishpur-Haldia  Pipeline  (JHPL)  is  an  extension  of  gas  transmission  pipeline  from  Jagdishpur, 
Uttar Pradesh to Haldia, Kolkata. This pipeline connects the eastern part of the country with the 
national  gas  grid.  JHPL  will  feed  natural  gas  to  industrial,  commercial,  domestic  and  transport 
sectors in West Bengal. The other phase of the JHPL will also connect Patna, Bihar. MoPNG has also 
proposed future extension of JHPL which would feed far North-eastern part (Guwahati, Assam) of 
India.  
 
The JHPL is said to be 2620 Kms long and it will be constructed in different phases to connect Gaya, 
Patna and Haldia. The JHPL is laid with different size of pipes based on its requirement and it is 
expected to handle 16 MMSCMD of gas flow. As of now, 90 Km of pipeline has been laid and it is 
anticipated to be commissioned in 2019 - 2020.  
Figure 87: Ongoing JHPL (Red Route) & Future Pipeline Extension to Assam (Blue Route) 
 
 
 
8.2 
Feasibility for gas transmission hook-up to Bangladesh from India 
Due to increase in demand for natural gas in Asian countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, India & 
Bangladesh, several Gas Transmission Pipelines have been proposed with mutual agreements and 
discussions  to  import  natural  gas  from  Gulf  countries.  Based  on  the  recent  pipeline  project, 
  
 
  
160 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
development & extension of the gas transmission grid which connects Haldia & Guwahati eastern 
region of India marks the possibility of hook-up connection to Bangladesh.  
 
The  JHPL  network  which  terminates  at  Haldia  is  forecasted  to  have  Gas  Boosting  Station  and 
considered  to  be  hub  for  gas  distributing  city.  Haldia  is  located  approx.  125  kms  southwest  of 
Kolkata. This JHPL network is under construction which connects Gaya in between. From Gaya, it 
runs to connect Patna & Barauni, Bihar as well. A 750-km proposed natural gas pipeline will link 
the Northeast with the national grid to meet increasing fuel needs of households and factories in 
the region. The proposed pipeline will have a capacity of 15 MMSCMD and will source gas at Barauni 
from Jagdishpur-Haldia pipeline being built by GAIL to connect Guwahati, Assam. 
 
OPTION-1 
For  the  transport  of  natural  gas  from  India  to  Bangladesh,  the  feasible  hook-up  location  will  be 
Haldia, Kolkata as Jagdishpur-Haldia Pipeline is an ongoing project and from Haldia the natural gas 
can  be  transported  to  South-West  part  of  Bangladesh.  A  pipeline  of  approx.  135  kms  can  be 
connected to Boalia, Satkhira, Bangladesh from Haldia, Kolkata This hook-up connection can supply 
gas to the southern region of Bangladesh. 
 
OPTION-2 
For  the  transport  of  natural  gas  from  India  to  Bangladesh,  the  feasible  hook-up  location  will  be 
Kishanganj, Bihar. A pipeline of approx. 120 kms can be connected to Dinajpur, Bangladesh from 
Kishanganj, Bihar which shall see few river crossings as well. This hook-up connection can supply 
gas to the northern region of Bangladesh. It is to be noted that the blue route pipeline in the below 
figure is still under proposal stage by India.  
Figure 88: Feasibility Options for Hook-up 
 
 
The  provided  options  above  for  the  gas  transmission  pipeline  which  connects  Dianjpur  from 
Kishanganj  and  Ishwaripur  from  Haldia  will  see  an  important  advantage  as  these  cities  will  be 
nearby locations to planned Gas Transmission Grid in Bangladesh.

8.3  Myanmar gas network and supply situation  
8.3.1  Reserves, production and consumption  
Myanmar gas reserves have increased rapidly in recent years as the political development has 
attracted renewed interest in the sector. In 2016, the reserves according to BP more than 
doubled to 42 tcf from 2015 to 2016. The gas reserves in Myanmar are consequently more than 
six times the Bangladesh gas reserves and of the same size as the Indian gas reserves.  
 
Gas production in Myanmar has increased rapidly in recent years and is now 1.8 bcf/year, while 
consumption is limited. Consequently, most of the gas was exported to China and Thailand, 
respectively.  
 
Myanmar has the highest R/P ratio in South and South-East Asia.  
 
8.3.2  Gas transmission infrastructure Myanmar  
The gas transmission system in Myanmar is based on export of gas to Thailand and China, 
respectively.  
 
The Myanmar-China gas pipeline connects the offshore gas fields of Myanmar to China. The 
pipeline was commissioned in 2013 and production and export have slowly increased. 
 
The Myanmar-Thailand pipeline connects the Total operated gas fields in Myanmar with Thailand 
via off- and onshore gas pipelines.  
 
8.3.3  Myanmar- Bangladesh trade options 
For the GSMP2016 the import of gas from Myanmar was not considered. Instead, the Myanmar 
gas reserves were developed for export to China and continuous export to Thailand.  
 
India has been developing plans for import of gas from Myanmar to India, with a possibility of 
crossing Bangladesh.  
 
From a technical point of view, the development of gas trade between Myanmar and Bangladesh 
can take place by installing a short pipeline of around 300 km from the landfall of the Myanmar 
offshore gas fields to the planned LNG import terminals in Bangladesh, and hereby using the 
same infrastructure from this location to Chittagong and further to Dhaka. This route can also 
constitute a part of a future route to India.  
 
As long as there are new discoveries and developments in Myanmar, it may be possible to 
purchase such spare gas.  
 
8.4  Recommendations for integration in “Bay of Bengal” gas market  
Based on the development in India, it is recommended to initially evaluate the possibilities for 
interconnection of India and Bangladesh already in the short run to share the LNG developments 
  
 
  
162 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
and need for back-up facilities. This will only require a relatively short pipeline of less than 200 
km. A connection between Myanmar and Bangladesh will make Bangladesh an important bridge 
between South and South-East Asian gas markets.  
Figure 89: Myanmar – Bangladesh – India pipeline connection possibility  
 
 
On the longer term, Bangladesh can become part of an integrated Euroasian gas market with 
indirect connections and agreements to Russia, Iran and Turkmenistan. By connecting 
Bangladesh to Myanmar and India it is possible to create a “Bay of Bengal” gas transmission 
system and consequently also a gas market.  
  
 
  
163 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 90: Possible “Bay of Bengal” integrated gas transmission system in Euroasia market  
 
 
By integrating the gas transmission systems in Bangladesh with India and Myanmar, it will be 
possible to share the LNG import facilities in India and Bangladesh and hereby improve technical 
security of gas supply. This is in particular important as severe weather conditions in the Bay of 
Bengal can close more terminals in Bangladesh at the same time.  
 
In the short term, it will be possible to increase the utilisation of the Indian LNG import terminals, 
which is presently only around 50 %.  
 
Myanmar can benefit by having both Bangladesh and India as new markets for gas in addition to 
Thailand and China. This may make it easier to attract international oil and gas companies for 
exploration and development.  
 
The Consultants strongly recommends accelerating the work on integration between the three 
countries. This can initially be done by creating a forum with participants from the three 
countries.

9.  LNG IMPORT 
LNG supply availability is of paramount importance to the continuity of gas supply in Bangladesh, 
since  indigenous  production  is  declining  and  there  is  no  short-term  production  to  offset  the 
demand-supply gap. 
 
As  of  January  2017,  the  total  nominal  capacity  of  global  liquefaction  plants  is  340  MTPA. 
Liquefaction capacity additions are poised to increase over the next few years as 114.6 MTPA of 
capacity  was  under-construction  as  of  January  2017.  Furthermore,  given  the  abundant  gas 
discoveries globally and the shale revolution in the US, it can be expected that this figure will grow 
significantly in the years to come. According to the World IGU Report, this figure is around 879 
MTPA. Global Regasification capacity increased nearly 800 MTPA by the beginning of 2017, mainly 
supported  by  additional  capacity  coming  online  in  established  markets  such  as  China,  Japan, 
France, India, Turkey, and South Korea. 
 
With respect to LNG trade World, IGU report for 2017 informs that for the third (3) consecutive 
years,  global  LNG  trade  set  a  new  record  reaching  258  MT.  This  marks  an  increase  of  13.1  MT 
(+5%) from 2015. The growth rate in 2016 was a noticeable increase from the average growth of 
0.5% over the last four years. The continued addition of supply in the Pacific Basin, primarily in 
Australia, as well as the start of exports from the United States Gulf of Mexico (US GOM) enabled 
this increase.  
 
As there are sufficient worldwide LNG resources to supply Bangladesh's gas import requirements, 
the import of LNG seems to be favourable. 
 
9.1 
Locations for all LNG Import facilities 
As  described  previously,  gas  supply  and  demand  balance  forecast  revealed  the  tremendous 
shortage of the natural gas supply. Therefore, the introduction of LNG would be the practical option 
in order to compensate the huge gap between the demand and supply. The LNG receiving facilities 
must be constructed in Bangladesh. The constructions of proven onshore facilities require a great 
amount of cost and time. While contrary, the offshore gas receiving facility has developed and does 
not require that much expenses and time.  
 
The purpose of this section is to review the key elements that will allow securing the stable natural 
gas supply to bulk users such as power stations and fertilisers in the future. Several key challenges 
are anticipated from the technical perspective in order to achieve an economic and energy effective 
LNG terminal. 
 
9.2  Overview of LNG Terminal Development Plans 
Bangladesh will need to install sufficient LNG receiving and distribution facilities to support domestic 
gas demand requirements. Minimum commitments to purchase LNG will be necessary at levels to 
support the long-term financing, construction and operations of these faculties.

Based on the analysis done in Chapter 4, Bangladesh will need to procure significant amounts of 
natural gas until 2041. And the latter objective is aimed to be achieved with the following projects 
listed in the table below, provided by RPGCL:

Both projects will be constructed in the south of Bangladesh as shown below and indicated by the 
grey spot. The proposed sites are situated at the south-eastern region of Bangladesh within the 
Upazilla Moheskhali under the district of Cox’s Bazar and spread along the Bay of Bengal.

Comparing with the present & future gas consumers of the entire country, the LNG infrastructure 
development proposals are mainly centred in the Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar (South-East regions 
of the country) areas. This will require significant investments in pipelines to transport natural 
gas through pipelines to the Western regions of the country. Therefore, RPGCL opines that in 
addition to the projects at Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar areas, Mongla Port and Paira Port areas 
(proposed) may be considered as LNG terminal development locations, directly feeding natural 
gas into the gas grids for the Western regions of the country; this will ensure energy security 
also. RPGCL is working along with the Government policy and has keen interest for the success of 
the Government through proper implementation of the SDG action plans (Mid-Term and Long-
Term development plans) up to 2030 and Vision – 2041 as well. 
 
The Consultants support this approach as one of the steps in optimising LNG import 
configurations. At the same time, we encourage relevant stakeholders to have sufficient data

available, e.g. site selection study, bathymetric and metocean data, feasibility study to justify 
these new locations. A thorough cost-benefit analysis should also be carried out against 
alternative options, before committing to any significant investments.    
 
 
 
9.3  Update of FSRU terminal planning in Bangladesh 
The FSRU will be located offshore near Moheshkhali Island in the Bay of Bengal.  
The terminal will serve as a hub to provide the crucial infrastructure required for the country to 
access natural gas from global markets.  
 
Moheshkhali Floating LNG will be a fully integrated turnkey floating LNG terminal with Excelerate 
Energy to develop, design, construct, install, finance, and operate the terminal. Excelerate Energy 
will operate the terminal for the first 15 years, after which the company will transfer ownership to 
Petrobangla.  The  FSRU  will  have  138,000  cubic  metres  of  LNG  storage  capacity  and  a  base 
regasification capacity of 500 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) with the possibility of 
expansion to 600 mmscfd. The terminal is expected to be in operation in 2018.

Another FSRU project has been signed and confirmed between the Summit Group and Petrobangla.  
A  company  of  Summit  group  will  install  a  Floating  Storage  and  Re-gasification  Unit  (FSRU)  at 
Moheshkhali Island in the Cox's Bazar. The state-owned Petrobangla signed on 20th of April 2017 
a deal with Summit Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal Company in this connection. The Summit 
will set up the floating storage and FSRU terminal, which is expected to go into operation after 18 
months in October 2018.  
 
The  floating  terminal  will  supply  500  million  cubic  feet  of  natural  gas  per  day.  The  contractual 
agreement will be on Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis. Summit will transfer the facilities 
to Petrobangla after operating it for 15 years. Summit will implement the project jointly with US-

based GE (20%) as equity investment partner. On completion of the project, the gas supplied by 
the  FSRU  can  potentially  supply  to  existing  oil-run  power  plants  like  Meghnaghat  and  possibly 
reduce power generation cost by less than half.6 
 
Figure 93: Floating Storage and Regasification Unit illustration 
 
 
Both projects proposed are based on the installation of an FSRU. Generally, the rapid growth of 
the FSRU market is mainly due to the lower cost, faster schedule, commercial flexibility and 
reusable asset feature of FSRUs when compared to land based (onshore) terminals which cannot 
be relocated and must be regarded as a sunk cost. 
 
The following table provides pros and cons of FSRU over onshore LNG receiving terminal.

9.4 
Economic Comparison between FSRU and Land-based LNG Receiving Terminal 
The main purpose of this section is to compare and provide key aspects of the two different LNG 
Import infrastructures, FSRU and Land based LNG terminal. It is essential to note that each method 
has its own features and advantages.  
 
FSRUs are based on LNG tankers and use essentially the same technology as onshore terminals. 
The only real difference is that the equipment is engineered to be suitable for shipyard construction 
and marine operation. For a new build vessel the equipment is normally integrated into the vessel. 
For a conversion the equipment is normally built as a separate module or modules and retrofitted 
to the LNG vessel in a shipyard to minimise time.   
 
LNG loading to FSRU will be carried out by STS (ship to ship transfer). In order to supply 500MMCFD 
of gas, more than 60 shipments will be required in a year. The construction of FSRU is almost the 
same as that of LNG tanker. Old LNG tankers can be remodelled as FSRU to save construction cost.  
 
Operation of FSRU is in general vulnerable to weather condition, and emergency evacuations plan 
must be in place if it is operating in the cyclone prone area. Land based LNG Terminal on the other 
hand requires a larger onshore footprint to minimise investment to the infrastructure and also to 
secure freedom to construct additional tanks to meet the incremental demand. The space required 
for such a land based LNG regasification plant is considered conservative. Initial tank numbers are 
assumed to be two and to be expanded with the increase of demand. 
 
Many of the original FSRUs were based on Moss or Membrane LNG tanker conversions. The recent 
trend has been to construct new build vessels with typically around 170,000 m3 geometric storage 
  
 
  
170 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
and a 600-750 mmscfd send out rate. However, it is interesting to note that Höegh LNG has just 
placed  an  order  with  Maritime  (engineering)  and  Wärtsila  Oil  and  Gas  for  the  conversion  of  an 
existing Moss tanker. It appears that the order is for the engineering and procurement of the long 
delivery  equipment  items  only,  to  enable  physical  conversion  work  to  be  completed  in  just  12 
months,  rather  than  the  normal  18  months  if  the  equipment  had  to  be  ordered.  Both  of  these 
conversion options are less than the 27-36 months required to construct a new vessel. 
 
As earlier mentioned, the operation of FSRU is vulnerable to weather condition. The bay of Bengal 
is known as Cyclone. Frequency of Cyclone landing at Moheshkhali area is not high in comparison 
with  other  areas,  but  influences  every  year.  The  scale  of  Cyclone  is  reported  to  be  increasingly 
larger than before. Thus, this is another fact which supports the idea of taking extra precautions, 
such as emergency evacuations plans etc.

Concerning  the  operation  expenditure  (OPEX)  and  capital  expenditure,  the  following  table 
summarises the key differences between FSRU and Land-based LNG Terminal.

In terms of the construction time, the majority of construction work of FSRU is carried out at a 
shipyard  and  amount  of  on-site  construction  work  is  relatively  small.  Project  schedule  from 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to the commencement of operation is short and takes less 
than 3 years as depicted in the table below.

The project schedule for Land-based LNG terminal is longer than that of FSRU. Significant time and 
effort must be taken into account as illustrated in the following table. This includes EIA agreement 
with  the  local  people  and  re-settlement  plan  associated  with  land  acquisition.  Large  scale  land 
preparation  work  and  infrastructure  construction  such  as  breakwater  will  be  carried  out  if 
necessary.  Construction  of  tank  foundation  to  avoid  uneven  settlement  is  also  time-consuming 
work.

10.  LEGAL AND REGULATORY 
10.1  Objective 
The objective of the legal and regulatory analysis is to discuss the policy and institutional reforms 
necessary for a sustainable development of the sector and provide a path for implementation of 
these reforms. The link between such reforms and reduction in cost of supply will be investigated 
to  ensure  that  investment  is  directed  towards  the  efficient  development  of  least  cost  options. 
Assessment of the policy framework includes a discussion of the ability of government to spur the 
development of least-cost solutions.  
 
10.2  Review of legal and regulatory documents  
The Consultants have reviewed key legal and regulatory documents for the gas sector, in 
particular:

10.3.2  The role of Petrobangla 
The single-buyer model applies in Bangladesh through a complex system of administered internal 
transfer prices. Petrobangla acquires gas from IOCs at PSC contract prices, mixes it with its own 
gas from subsidiaries, then transmits the gas and distributes it to its customers. Ultimately, 
Petrobangla is allocating gas to consumers and administering a bundled gas price set by the 
BERC. 
 
Petrobangla also has a role as the upstream regulator, supervising and monitoring the PSCs at 
the same time it is the counterpart to the contracts. It is also self-regulating its own operations, 
including its subsidiaries. 
 
  
 
  
176 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Petrobangla Annual Report for the year ending 30 June 2015 included a Statement of Profit or 
Loss, that showed an operating loss of BDT 1,272,296,773 (USD 15.7 million), net surplus of BDT 
461,364,554 (USD 5.7 million) and a deficit on the Appropriation account of BDT 30,547,281,756 
(USD 378.6 million) mainly from deficits brought forward from previous years. 
 
10.3.3  Financial flows in the gas sector 
The flow of gas and money in the Bangladesh gas sector is shown in Figure 96. Starting from the 
top of the figure, there are gas productions from IOCs and the Petrobangla subsidiaries i.e. 
BAPEX, BGFCL and SGFL. The IOC gas production under Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) is 
split in “Cost Gas” (cost recovery of the investment and operational expenses) and “Profit Gas” 
(revenues in excess of cost).

The Profit Gas which Petrobangla receives is free of charge and is provided for free to its 
subsidiaries, called “Distribution companies” in Figure 96. The IOCs could in principle sell their 
profit gas to the highest bidder; however, in practice Petrobangla exercises its “right of first 
refusal” to purchase cost and profit gas and provide it to its subsidiaries.    
  
 
  
177 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
The gas produced by Petrobangla subsidiaries BGFCL, SGFL and BAPEX is sold at gas tariff set by 
BERC, which include the transmission charges to GTCL and distribution charges. The Distribution 
companies sell gas to consumers at gas tariffs set by BERC. 
As can be seen from Figure 96, the subsidiaries collect the revenue from the sale of gas and 
receive a margin to cover their expenditures. This structure results in a profit for all subsidiaries, 
while Petrobangla’s consolidated account shows a loss, mainly due to the low-end user prices.   
 
10.3.4 Petrobangla subsidiaries 
Aside from exploring oil and gas and drilling, BAPEX is producing nearly 130 mmcfd. BAPEX made 
a post-tax net profit of BDT 654.0 million in FY 2014-15. BAPEX has formulated a time-bound 
action plan with a view to accelerating the exploration of oil and gas and augmenting production 
by 2021. 
 
Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited (BGFCL) is the largest state-owned natural gas 
production company in Bangladesh. It is a public limited company registered under Companies 
Act and contributes about 35% of total gas production of the country. BGFCL earned a gross 
revenue of BDT 32,116.7 million and a pre-tax profit of BDT 6,983.8 million during the FY 2014-
15.  
 
Sylhet Gas Fields Limited (SGFL) is the second largest state-owned gas company. SGFL 
produced 54.08 BCF of gas in FY 2014-15 The gas is supplied to Jalalabad, Bakhrabad, 
Pashchimanchal and Karnaphuli gas distribution companies. During FY 2014-15, the company 
earned BDT 4,155.8 million from the sales of gas and BDT 12,515.5 million from the sales of 
finished liquid products. Company earned pre-tax profit of BDT 6,144.3 million in FY 2014-15.   
 
Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) was incorporated in 1993 with the objectives 
of (i) centralising operation and maintenance of the national gas grid; and (ii) expanding the 
national gas grid and as required, ensuring balanced supply and usage of natural gas in all 
regions of the country. Gas transmission pipelines built by other companies before creation of 
GTCL have been integrated with the GTCL system. It operates 1560 km of gas transmission 
pipelines, delivering gas to franchise areas of Jalalabad, Titas, Bakhrabad, Karnaphuli and 
Paschimancahal gas marketing and distribution companies respectively. GTCL earned an amount 
of BDT 6,369.7 million as revenue and BDT 5,340.3 million (USD 66.3 million) as pre-tax profit 
FY 2014-15.  
 
Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited (TGTDCL) is the largest transmission 
and distribution company with a 62% share of the Bengali market serving 12 districts including 
Dhaka. It owns and operates around 450 km high-pressure transmission pipelines, with lower 
capacity than those of GTCL. Petrobangla holds 75% shares of this company while private 
shareholders hold 25% of the shares. The company earned a net profit on operations before tax 
of BDT 12,101.3 million (USD 150.3 million) in FY 2014-15.   
  
 
  
178 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are five other distribution companies, of which Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution 
System Limited (JGTDSL) owns and operates transmission pipelines, same case for Karnaphuli 
Gas Distribution Company Limited (KGDCL), the youngest company established in 2010. 
 
10.3.5  Unaccounted for gas 
Unaccounted for gas, explained by Petrobangla as System loss, plus pifferage/system gain was at 
its maximum 33.7 bcf in 2005/2006, or 6.4% of total production, which was due to a sudden 
sharp growth in gas demand and had affected the pressure factor on gas metering, and fell to 
0.4% in the second half of 2015 from 1.7% in 2014-15 (after some years in the negative (i.e., 
system gain). If this figure is correct and sustainable, Petrobangla has reached a level for 
Unaccounted for gas comparable to international best practice. The National Transmission 
System in the UK estimates Unaccounted for gas for gas transmission to 0.2-0.3 % of throughput 
in recent years. 
 
10.4  Gas tariffs 
The BERC Act from 2003 gave the Commission the mandate to regulate downstream gas tariffs. 
The Notification on Gas Tariff Methodology, 29 December 2010, provides the procedure and 
methodology to gas companies to calculate and request gas tariff revisions. The methodology 
determines how to calculate, how to allocate average and peak costs, the cost of service for 
different customer classes and the calculation of Revenue Requirement for service to each class. 
Rate of Return for distribution licenses on qualifying assets or rate base is determined based on a 
calculation of the weighted average cost of capital. To determine the return on equity, the 
Commission gives preference to a Capital Asset Pricing Model, but allows other calculation 
options. 
 
BERC sets tariffs for 7 customer classes and residential consumption, which can be metered or 
unmetered.  These customer classes are defined in the Gas Act. The latest price increases were 1 
March and 1 June 2017 resulting in current prices shown in Table 38 By international standards 
these are low, in particular prices paid by the power stations, which take around 40% of all gas in 
Bangladesh, and the prices paid by fertilisers taking around 7% of the gas. Other large gas 
consumers, captive power and industry pay around three times as much as power stations and 
fertiliser for the gas, but still less than in most countries.

Figure 97 provides an international comparison of wholesale gas prices in 2016. It shows that 
Bangladesh's gas prices are in the lower half compared with other gas markets (around the 40% 
benchmark). Since 2014, Bangladesh's gas price has gone up by almost USD 1/MMbtu, while gas 
prices have gone down in many countries due to lower oil prices and oversupply in the LNG 
market. 
 
The exception to low prices in Bangladesh is the price of CNG.  Its price is based on the price of 
the fuels it substitutes (Gasoline and Diesel): the price of 1400 BDT/Mcf (or USD 17.39/Mcf) 
translates into more than USD 100/barrel of oil.

The latest gas price increases were the first since 2015 and before that, 2011. Figure 98 shows 
the development in gas tariffs in Bangladesh since 2002 for the key customer classes. Price 
increases for power and fertiliser have been moderate over these years and the prices are still 
low based on international comparisons. There have been recent sharp increases in the prices 
paid by commercial, captive power and domestic metered gas consumption. These three classes 
of customers account for almost 30% of total gas demand in Bangladesh, the commercial sector, 
however, consumes only a fraction of this (less than 1%). 
 
CNG is not shown in the graph. The price for CNG has more than doubled since 2011 and 
increased five times since 2008. CNG consumption accounts for around 5% of total gas demand 
in the country. Also not shown is the fixed payment for unmetered burners, which has doubled 
since 2009.   
 
In 2009 and 2010 BERC rejected price increase applications from Petrobangla, on the grounds of 
the profitability of its retail, transmission and wholesale businesses and in 2016, BERC rejected 
the proposal of increasing gas prices, placed by Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company 
Ltd, saying that the company did not need to increase its distribution charges because the 
estimated revenue was above the revenue requirement7.

The breakdown of the gas prices is shown in Table 39 The end user price is shown in the left 
column. The key components are a Government tax around 50% of the end user price, which is 
high by international standards. The other approx. 50% are allocated to Petrobangla companies 
in the form of margins: 
Thin margins for upstream operations: BAPEX and wellhead margin. 
 
Transmission and distribution margins are also very thin. 
 
Payments to provide a return on assets. 
 
  Contributions to the petroleum development fund and the gas development fund.  
 
BERC ordered the gas development fund to be set up when it increased natural gas tariffs in 
2009, with the condition that the additional revenue generated following the increase would be 
transferred to the fund. The funds are used to carry out gas exploration and development and to 
enhance the capacity of the national exploration and production companies. In 2014-15, 19 
investment projects financed by the gas development fund were under development.

While the BAPEX and wellhead margin for upstream operations are thin, funds from the Price 
Deficit Fund Margin and a Deficit Wellhead Margin for BAPEX more than double the funds 
available for upstream activities under Petrobangla (in addition to investments from IOCs).   
  
The transmission and distribution margins are extremely low, around 2% respectively 4% of the 
average gas price. The transmission margin does not provide GTCL sufficient funding for the 
expansion of a reliable transmission system to facilitate transport of new production and 
imported LNG to consumption areas. GTCL’s reliance on public funding and donor assistance 
(ADB, JICA and World Bank) has meant that it has been unable to invest sufficiently to develop 
transmission infrastructure. In 2014-15, only two pipeline projects were self-financed by GTCL. 
 
The Distribution margin is higher than the transmission margin as gas distribution of smaller 
volumes at lower pressure is more costly. The Distribution company margin is vital for a 
sustainable operation of the low pressure grid delivering gas to consumers. The margin does not 
support the distribution companies’ capability in investments to expand the network. Distribution 
companies are also relying on donor assistance for investment projects. 
		
The gas price breakdown shows that much larger funds are set aside for shortfall and energy 
security and funds set aside to carry out gas exploration and development and for the gas 
development fund. The margin for transmission and distribution should be increased, either 
through a higher gas price, possibly from funds set aside for other purposes. A better solution 
would be to develop tariffs for transmission and distribution of gas, providing transmission and 
distribution companies with sufficient funds for self-financing of their investment in expansions.

10.5  Gas allocation and pricing 
10.5.1  Gas Utilisation Guidelines8 
This Guideline reviews gas supply and demand balance, projects the future supply and demand 
balance and reviews gas fuel efficiency in the main sectors, including for various plants and 
equipment. It concludes with a sector-based priority for domestic gas allocation when shortages 
begin: 
1.  Fertiliser  
2.  Electricity  
3.  Industry/tea garden  
4.  Captive power  
5.  Residential/commercial  
6.  CNG  
 
The guidelines also recommend a number of efficiency measures: 
To reduce gas to the fertiliser sector by 10%, and to increase the efficiency of fertiliser 
 
factories using more than 35 Mcf/ton of fertiliser, and closing the most inefficient plant; 
To limit the total allocation of gas to the power sector to 40% of the daily gas supply, 
 
only provide gas supply to new power plants that have more than 50% fuel efficiency, 
and are based on combined cycle technology and duel-fuelled. Suspend gas supply to low 
efficiency power plants; 
To reduce gas supply to filling stations, price increases for CNG, and  
 
To reduce gas supply to low-efficiency captive power plants.  
 
 
An ADB study estimated the economic value of gas in domestic, transport, power and fertiliser 
sectors in 2011 in Bangladesh9. Willingness to Pay for natural gas used as CNG was concluded to 
be the highest, which was followed by gas substituting petroleum products in power generation, 
gas used to produce fertiliser and for household cooking.   
Table 40: Actual price of gas, Marginal Value Product and Willingness to Pay for gas, 2011 
 
Source: TARIFF REFORMS AND INTERSECTORAL ALLOCATION OF NATURAL GAS, ADB 2013 
 
The study showed that the current gas allocation and pricing does not reflect economic values of 
gas. Only 9.3% of the value of gas is captured in the power sector when substituting petroleum 
products (although oil prices averaged USD 104 per barrel, around the double of the 2017

average until July, the value captured is still low today), and 21.6% substituting coal. The bulk of 
the gas is allocated for power generation. In the fertiliser sector only 12% of the economic value 
was captured. The highest price was charged for CNG but it was only 66% of the Willingness to 
Pay. In the household sector the gas price was only about 36% of the Willingness to Pay for gas. 
Household sector received only 12% of the gas. This indicates severe under-pricing and 
inefficient allocation of natural gas in Bangladesh. If the economic efficiency is strictly followed, 
more gas should be allocated to the sectors where the economic value is highest, i.e., CNG, 
replacing petroleum products in the power sector, and in the fertiliser sector. 
 
10.6  Upstream fiscal terms for the PSCs and Bidding process 
The 2012 Offshore bidding round attracted little interest from private investors. The reason for 
the lukewarm response may include low gas prices and Petrobangla’s right of first refusal to buy 
the gas production. The lack of access to good geological data was also a factor reducing 
contractors’ interest.   
 
The fiscal terms for the 2012 Round can be summarised as follows10: 
  Exploration period: Seven years for onshore and eight years for offshore blocks. 
  Contract term is 20 years for oil and 25 years for gas after approval of the Development 
plan. 
  Contractor can dispose gas freely but Petrobangla has first right of refusal and will pay a 
discounted price (1-4%). 
  Contractor has obligation to sell gas in the domestic market. Exports are not allowed. 
  Biddable profit share on a sliding scale. 
  Maximum annual cost recovery: 55% of the revenues.  
  Offshore Gas Prices: Arithmetic Average Asian Petroleum Price Index for High Sulphur Oil 
180 CST FOB with a floor at USD 100 per tonne (normally 20-30 percent below crude oil 
prices, approx. USD 2.6/MMBtu) and ceiling at USD 200 per tonne (approx. USD 
5.2/MMBtu). 
  Onshore gas prices are 75-90% of the Offshore price. 
  Carried interest of 10% in all shallow water gas blocks for BAPEX.  
 
In 2016, Petrobangla changed the strategy away from bidding rounds towards direct negotiations 
with interested parties. Petrobangla invited EOIs from interested IOCs for specific offshore blocks. 
Instead of finalising the model production-sharing contract before launching the bidding round, 
the contract terms will be fixed on the basis of the bids received, with following negotiations. 
 
Compared with other countries in the region (see Appendix 5 for case studies of India, Pakistan 
and Vietnam), the lessons to be taken away are: 
 
India introduced an Open Acreage licensing policy. Contractors can select exploration blocks 
 
throughout the year without waiting for the formal bidding round from the government.  It 
                                               
10 OIES: Natural Gas in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Current issues and Trends. Ieda Gomes. 2013 
  
 
  
185 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
also introduced freedom for pricing and marketing of gas produced in the domestic market for 
contractors, a uniform licensing system and reduced royalty in all areas. 
 
India also linked the gas price for producers to prices in international gas hubs, rather than 
 
bunker fuel and set a higher ceiling for the gas price from high cost fields, such as those in 
deep sea and high-pressure high-temperature areas.   
 
Myanmar had some success in its offshore waters adjacent to Bangladesh’s continental shelf. 
Woodside Energy has made three gas discoveries in 2016 and 2017. Shell has an equity share in 
two of these and is operating five other blocks. Total has been operating the Yadana field since it 
started production in 1998 and started up production in Badamyar in 2017. Chevron, however, 
after signing a new PSC in 2015, put its assets up for sale in 2016. Key features of Myanmar’s 
petroleum fiscal terms for PSCs are summarised in Appendix 6.  A key difference from the terms 
in Bangladesh’s PSCs is that exports of gas are allowed and that gas prices are not presented in 
the contract. On the other hand, the profit share in the Bangladesh contract is biddable, i.e., 
more flexible.  
 
As for the bureaucracy involved in the selection of investors, there are no specific studies of the 
oil and gas sector.  There are, however Benchmark studies of Public Procurement11 providing a 
comparative evaluation of legal and regulatory environments that affect the ability of private 
sector companies to do business with governments in 180 economies. The Benchmarking shows 
that Bangladesh on average does better than other South Asian countries, including the two 
other oil and gas producers in the region, India and Pakistan, on needs assessment, call for 
tender, and bid preparation, bid submission phase, bid opening, evaluation, contract award phase 
and management of the procurement contract12.  Bangladesh scores lower than the other 
countries on performance guarantee and on the time and procedure needed for suppliers to 
receive payment. 
 
Having ruled out systematic barriers in the legal and regulatory environment, the reason for the 
low response to the bidding rounds in Bangladesh may be found in the institutional setup of the 
bidding round and the obligation to sell the gas in Bangladesh at a pre-determined price formula. 
Bangladesh has to align the risk/award framework to attract foreign investors in competition with 
other countries.

Box no. 1 Lessons learned from gas regulation in India, Pakistan and Vietnam 
Appendix 5 reviews lessons for Bangladesh from case studies of gas regulation in India, Pakistan 
and Vietnam. Some lessons are: 
 
Separate Regulation from policy function and operations: In India, the Upstream Regulator, DGH 
is the technical arm of the ministry and acts as a regulatory body having oversight on all 
concessions relating to oil and gas to avoid potential conflicts of interest between the NOCs and 
IOCs. In Pakistan, the upstream oil and gas activities are regulated by the Directorate General of 
Petroleum Concessions (DGPC). The downstream regulator in Pakistan is independent from the 
Ministry, and the government-controlled companies. Both DGH and DGPC are managing bidding 
rounds in their countries. Like Bangladesh, Vietnam has a dominant state-owned oil and gas 
company that is delegated by the government to carry out petroleum exploitation and 
exploration, signing oil and gas contracts and supervising IOCs operating in the sector. Its 
subsidiary, PV Gas links gas from the upstream gas supplies to the end-users and has the sole 
rights to distribution pipeline development. This model can benefit the sector in the early stages 
of oil and gas development but can also delay later developments due to potential conflicts of 
interest, self-regulation, and lack of independent regulation. 
 
Update Petroleum policies: The Governments of both India and Pakistan issue petroleum policies 
on a regular basis, to adjust to the country’s needs, to international markets and developments 
and to attract international investors. Bangladesh issued a Petroleum policy 1993 that has not 
been updated. 
 
Options for a more competitive gas industry: The Government of Pakistan has been assessing the 
performance of Pakistan’s natural gas sector and developed options for the future direction of the 
sector towards a competitive and deregulated sector with increased private sector participation. 
This would among other things involve overcoming the current barriers to selling directly to 
customers at prices that are higher than today and at the same time fully cover costs, including 
future gas supply and LNG imports.   
 
10.7  Regulatory framework 
 
10.7.1  Upstream Regulation 
Petrobangla has a role as the upstream regulator, supervising and monitoring the PSCs at the 
same time it is the counterpart to the contracts. It is also self-regulating its own operations, 
including its subsidiaries.  
 
PSC Directorate of Petrobangla has 30 years experience of administering the PSC and some 
opportunities are still left behind to strengthen the existing PSC structure of Petrobangla to boost 
up exploration activities. 
 
The current model for upstream regulation in Bangladesh has been benefitting the sector 
especially in the early stages of oil and gas development. However, in the future it may delay oil 
  
 
  
187 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
and gas developments in later stages due to potential conflicts of interest, self-regulation, and 
lack of an independent regulator. The introduction of independent regulation can give potential 
investors confidence that conflict of interests between Petrobangla and the investors will not lead 
to biased decisions. Alignment with international best practice in the long term can therefore 
increase the investments in the offshore and boost gas production. 
 
In the meantime, Bangladesh currently has a more complex bureaucratic system comparing to 
international average – some simplifications on this can accelerate investment cycles, and be 
more attractive to foreign investors as a result. It needs to be acknowledged that a tie-in of 
upstream regulation and exploration activities by two different organizations/agencies can be a 
time-consuming event. Petrobangla’s experience of administering the PSC for last 30 years also 
needs to be recognised, such that Petrobangla’s focus to boost up exploration activities should be 
supported but not hammered if relevant authorities consider setting up an independent 
regulation agency in due course. 
 
Below are some key characteristics of an independent upstream regulator: 
  Have regulatory functions only 
  Not have Policy functions – they should be in the Ministry’s domain 
  Be an Adviser to the Ministry: Ministry signs Petroleum contracts on the advice of the 
Regulator 
  Upstream Regulator should be placed under the line Ministry, not in the State-owned Oil and 
Gas Company 
  Have independent funding and staggered staff appointments 
  Streamline data and information gathering from the companies and provide information to 
the public  
  The Upstream regulator manages the bidding rounds, and direct negotiations with petroleum 
investors 
Link the Upstream Regulator’s funding to the revenue received from industry fees, but budget 
 
is still approved by the government   
  Give incentives to improve efficiency and capabilities of staff 
 
 
 
10.7.2  Downstream Regulator BERC 
The Gas Act 2010 regulates the downstream gas sector: the transmission, distribution, 
marketing, supply and storage of natural gas. The Act regulates almost all forms of gases with 
energy content: Natural Gas, LNG, CNG, LPG, SNG, NGLs, CBM.   
 
BERC is empowered to apply the provisions of the Gas Act to issue, renew, amend and cancel 
licenses for pipeline construction for gas transmission, distribution, supply and storage. The Act 
defines the customer classes for that are used for the gas tariff (see Table 39). BERC sets the 
price for gas supply and storage of gas, except for gas sold under PSCs for which the price is set 
  
 
  
188 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the contract. Finally, the Act determines penalties for operating without a license or not 
following the license.  
 
BERC was established by an Act in 2003, as an independent and impartial regulatory commission 
for the energy sector in Bangladesh. It is situated within the Ministry of Power, Energy and 
Mineral Resources. 
 
The Commission shall consist of a Chairman and four Members who are full-time officers, 
appointed by the President on the basis of the proposal of the Ministry. The Chairman shall be 
the Chief Executive of the Commission. Each member is appointed for a three-year term. The 
date of appointment of each member is different and thus date of expiry of tenure of each 
member is also different.   
 
The decision of the meeting of the Commission shall be taken by a majority of votes of the 
Members present. However, in practice most of the decisions are taken unanimously on 
consensus.  
 
The main functions of the Commission include: 
to ensure efficient use, quality services, determine tariff and safety enhancement of 
 
electricity generation and transmission, marketing, supply, storage and distribution of energy 
(i.e., the electricity, gas and petroleum products), which includes the mandate to regulate 
downstream gas tariffs. 
to determine gas tariffs for transmission, marketing, supply, storage and distribution of gas 
 
(and other energy).    
to issue, cancel, amend, determine conditions of licenses, and exemption of licenses. 
 
to approve the overall program of the licensee. 
 
to promote competition amongst the licensees. 
 
to resolve disputes between the licensees, and between licensees and consumers, 
 
to ensure control of environmental standard of energy under existing laws. 
 
 
10.7.3  Tariff Determination 
Section 34 of the BERC Act 2003 provides the following policy framework for tariff determination:  
1.  harmonisation  of  the  tariff  with  the  cost  of  production,  transmission,  marketing, 
distribution, supply and storage of energy; 
2.  efficiency, least cost, excellent service, excellent investment; 
3.  consumers’ interest. 
 
BERC’s License Regulations and Funding are summarised in Appendix 7. 
 
10.8  Imports of LNG and move towards a competitive gas market 
The costs of imports will be higher than the current cost of indigenous gas production. 
Bangladesh should start a discussion of how to price the higher LNG costs and which customers 
are going to pay the higher price.  
  
 
  
189 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Today’s gas market structure can be characterised as a single-buyer model with a complex 
system of administered internal transfer prices. Petrobangla acquires gas from IOCs at PSC 
contract prices, mixes it with its own gas from subsidiaries, then other subsidiaries transmit and 
distribute it to their customers. In other words, the Government is allocating gas to consumers 
and administering a bundled gas price set by BERC. Bundled prices, which do not differentiate 
between the price of gas as a commodity and the cost of transmission and distribution, have 
undesirable implications as they lead to inefficient pricing, they do not show financial viability of 
the various segments production, transmission, and distribution, and they result in cross-
subsidies. 
 
Petrobangla has right of first refusal on all gas produced by IOCs under PSC contracts; if it does 
not exercise this right, producers can sell to third parties in Bangladesh at a price equal to the 
price Petrobangla pays. Producers compete to explore for and produce gas through the bidding 
on PSCs. Competition for PSC contracts is in theory good, but it will not necessarily reduce the 
price of gas for consumers as Petrobangla has no incentive to buy gas at the lowest possible price 
and pass through the cost savings to consumers under the current system. In addition, there is 
no pressure or incentive to reduce transmission and distribution costs. 
 
In general, the options for introducing LNG in the current gas market structure in Bangladesh 
include: 
1.  As a single buyer of gas, Petrobangla can continue to mix the higher priced LNG imports 
with gas from PSCs and its own gas. GTCL and Petrobangla subsidiaries then transmit 
and distribute the gas to its customers at a bundled gas price set by the Government. 
2.  Establish two markets for gas: 1) The current low-priced gas supplied by Petrobangla 
subsidiaries to their customers at regulated prices, and 2) a market for new gas supply at 
(higher) market prices to customers willing to pay the higher price to get gas supply.  
LNG importers could be government–owned companies (Petrobangla, Power Cell) or 
private, selling gas at unregulated prices to customers willing to pay the price.  
 
Single Buyer of gas 
The first option continues the single buyer model: Petrobangla acquires LNG imports, gas from 
IOCs at PSC contract prices, mixes it with its own gas from subsidiaries, then transmits the gas 
and distributes it to its customers through GTCL and distribution companies. This would of course 
result in a higher cost base and reduce Petrobangla’s margin, so higher sales prices would be 
required. These could be a general tariff increase to all consumer categories, or focusing the price 
increases to certain customer categories, able to pay the higher price. 
 
This option is not recommended as it would continue cross-subsidies, inefficient allocation of 
resources and distorted pricing and reduce the economic growth rate in the medium and long 
term. 
 
Dual markets for gas  
  
 
  
190 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
The key issue in this option is to determine the customers’ willingness and ability to pay a higher 
price to get gas supplied by new LNG imports. These customers would be creditworthy industries 
and new efficient power plants that have high base load and that are not able to get sufficient 
gas at the current tariff due to gas supply shortages. The remaining gas customers would 
continue to buy gas under the current tariff schedules. i.e. at regulated prices. These customers 
would be fertiliser, old power stations, tea gardens and residential/commercial.  
 
To allow private or public importers of LNG to sell gas to creditworthy industries and power plants 
unable to get sufficient gas at the current tariff, they would need access to the transmission and 
distribution network to reach their customers unless they supply new customers close to the LNG 
landing points through their own pipelines.   
 
Non-discriminatory access (Third Party Access (TPA)) to gas transmission and distribution 
networks will allow third parties to reach the customers using the existing gas infrastructure. The 
national gas transmission company, GTCL, was established to separate gas transmission system 
from distribution, and while not all gas transmission assets have been transferred to GTCL from 
other Petrobangla subsidiaries and while GTCL does not provide third party access today, its 
articles of association permit it to operate as a common carrier.   
 
What does it take to introduce third party access?  Box no. 2 shows the experience in the 
European Union, which of course is a more complicated case since it involves both opening up to 
competition in gas trade within countries and to cross-border trade between countries.   
 
Box no. 2 Introduction of Third Party Access and competition in European gas markets 
 
One of the core objectives of the European Union was a single market for gas. It took about 15 
years to reach that objective.    
 
1998 Gas Directive 
It started with the 1998 Gas Directive, which introduced a new legal framework aimed at opening 
the gas networks to third parties. This was to be achieved through unbundling of the existing 
vertically integrated gas operators, thus allowing competition for supplies and customers within 
the natural monopoly network. Initially, big gas customers, such as power plants and big 
industrial consumers could choose their gas supplier. At least 20% of the national market had to 
be open for competition.   
 
To ensure transparent and non-discriminatory access to all potential suppliers of the market, the 
operator of the transmission system was to be unbundled, minimum at an accounting level.   
 
The monitoring of this new system was assigned to a regulatory body in each country, which had 
to be independent from the market and from the state, to ensure transparent and non-
discriminatory operations on the market. 
 
  
 
  
191 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
2003, the Second Gas Directive  
Several markets opened more up to competition than the required consumption level (79% vs. the 
minimum  of  20%).  The  second  Gas  Directive  mandated  regulated  TPA  as  the  basic  rule  for  all 
existing  infrastructure,  opening  of  the  market  for  all  customers,  as  well  as  moving  the  level  of 
unbundling  of  Transmission  System  Operators  to  the  level  of  legal  separation  (e.g.  regulated 
activities under the responsibility of separate entities).  
 
2009, Directive on Internal market in gas 
This  Directive  ruled  that  from  2012  Member  States  had  to  unbundle  transmission  systems  and 
transmission system operators.   
 
Some of the first steps shown in Box 2 have already been implemented in Bangladesh. A 
regulatory body has been established to monitor the transmission system: BERC regulates the 
downstream gas sector. A part of the transmission system has been unbundled as GTCL is 
unbundled at the accounting level. However, TGTDCL, KGDCL, and JGTDSL also own and operate 
transmission pipelines in their supply areas. These are integrated with GTCL’s transmission 
pipelines, but owned and operated by the regional companies. These transmission assets need to 
be unbundled at the accounting level. 
	
The next step would be to mandate non-discriminatory regulated TPA as the basic rule for the 
GTCL transmission network and legally separate GTCL from Petrobangla.  
 
BERC’s Act and License Regulations would need to be updated to include appropriate tariff 
methodology, new licenses and additional responsibilities for the regulation of TPA to pipelines to 
enable the downstream regulator to promote competition in the gas market and ensure a smooth 
transition. 
 
The opening of the gas market could start with GTCL’s 1396 km network and GTCL is currently 
expanding transmission capacity from Cox’s Bazar where the LNG will be landed to Bakhrabad.  
However, it is recommended to continue the transfer of all transmission assets to GTCL, so that 
more industries and power plants could be served by TPA from the high-pressure pipelines or by 
a spurline connected directly to these pipelines. 
 
For  TPA  to  work,  a  number  of  technical  matters  needs  to  be  solved.  Licenses  for  import  of  gas 
(LNG), transmission, shipping and sale of gas (and later distribution of gas) will need to be drafted 
and agreed by the gas companies, traders and consumers and the regulator. A network code would 
need to be introduced for gas transmission to support market liberalisation. This includes a set of 
rules  for  gas  flows  in  the  system  ensuring  that  competition  can  be  facilitated  on  level  terms.  It 
includes transmission tariffs, determines Entry and Exit points for gas in the system, and governs 
processes such as the balancing of the gas system, network planning, and the allocation of network 
capacity.  It  should  also  be  considered  to  include  offshore  pipelines  in  the  TPA  system  to  give 
incentives to the development of marginal offshore fields.   
  
 
  
192 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To reach a fully competitive gas market, the operation of GTCL would need to be unbundled from 
the  Petrobangla  ownership,  and  competition  should  be  extended  to  customers  served  by  the 
distribution  companies.  These  companies  would  need  to  legally  separate  their  trading  and 
distribution  functions  to  provide  third  party  access  through  their  networks  and  introduce 
distribution system network codes. 
 
As part of the gas sector reforms in Pakistan, the Government decided to open up the 
country’s gas market to third parties to promote imports of pipeline gas and LNG and facilitate 
the growth of the gas sector. The Government has issued policy documents for public comments 
to set the high-level principles for TPA, network code and gas transportation tariff (see Appendix 
5). 
 
 
10.9  Timing of introduction of dual markets  
LNG imports are expected to start in 2018 when the first FSRU is commissioned, followed by a 
second FSRU in 2019 and a third unit in 2021 (see Gas Sector Roadmap).  The Roadmap for the 
pricing and regulatory changes is based on the assumption that it will take 4-5 years to decide 
and implement the regulatory measures required to open the gas market to TPA. In this period, 
the higher costs of LNG imports should be mixed with gas from PSCs and Petrobangla’s own gas.  
From around 2021, the licenses, rules for TPA and network codes will be in place so that eligible 
customers can buy gas directly from suppliers.

Our analysis and review of the institutional and regulatory framework in Bangladesh has been 
centred around answering the central question of how reforms could support a least cost supply 
solution to Bangladesh. It is clear from the previous analysis that the infrastructure needs are 
very much dependent on the development in both gas demand and supply. Gas demand and 
supply is in many ways a function of the regulatory environment, thus the choices and 
recommendations made in this respect will have an indirect impact on the infrastructure 
requirements.

MAIN FINDING: SHORTAGE OF GAS NECCESITATES RECONSIDERATION 
OF THE GAS UTILISATION GUIDELINES 
 
RECOMMENDATION: RECONSIDER THE ALLOCATION OF GAS ON SECTORS AND THE GAS 
UTILISATION GUIDELINES FOR DOMESTIC GAS ALLOCATION WHEN GAS SHORTAGES 
PREVAIL.  
 
The Economic value of gas is highest when used for CNG in vehicles, replacing oil products in 
power generation and to produce fertiliser. The Guidelines put fertiliser as the top priority and 
CNG as the lowest priority. The Consultants does not agree with this priority; More gas should be 
allocated to the sectors where the economic value is highest, i.e. CNG, replacing petroleum 
products in the power sector, and in the fertiliser sector. 
 
 
 
MAIN FINDING: PRICING OF LNG IMPORTS AND SEGMENTATION OF 
THE MARKETS NEEDS TO BE ADRESSED 
 
Since 2014, Bangladesh's gas price has gone up by almost USD 1/MMbtu. There has been a 
sharp increase in the price paid by CNG users, commercial, captive power and domestic metered 
gas consumption. However, Bangladesh's gas prices are in the lower half compared with other 
countries (around the 40% benchmark). 
 
Soon LNG will be imported at higher costs than the current gas purchases from PSCs and 
Petrobangla subsidiaries. This will necessitate an increase in the gas tariff in the short term. 
However, a continuation of the current model in which Petrobangla acquires LNG imports; 
purchases gas from IOCs at PSC contract prices, mixing it with its own gas from subsidiaries, 
then transmits the gas and distributes it to its customers through GTCL and distribution 
companies, is not recommended as it would continue cross-subsidies, inefficient allocation of 
resources and distorted pricing and reduce the economic growth rate in the medium and long 
term. This should be phased out over the medium term. 
 
RECOMMENDATION: INTRODUCE DUAL MARKETS FOR GAS PROTECTING THE DOMESTIC 
MARKET WHILE INTRODUCING MARKET BASED PRICES FOR THE MOST EFFICIENT AND 
CREDITWORTHY USERS 
 
This option allows for a gradual transition to a more competitive gas market. As domestic gas 
production from existing fields continue to fall over time and higher cost supply from new fields 
and imports increase over time, more gas will be sold at the new, higher price. This may also 
spur new domestic production to come on stream. A key issue is to determine the customers’ 
willingness and ability to pay a higher price to get gas supplied by new LNG imports.

The analysis in Table 40 showed that in key sectors, power generation and fertilizer, less that one 
quarter of the of economic value of gas is captured. At today’s lower oil prices this would be 
correspond to less than 50% captured, indicating that the gas has a higher economic value for 
the customers in these sectors and they should be able to pay a higher price. 
 
RECOMMENDATION: INTRODUCE NON-DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS TO TRANSMISSION 
AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS  
 
The introduction of non-discriminatory access to transmission and distribution networks will 
contribute to a move towards more competition. Today, GTCL is already unbundled at the 
accounting level. However, three transmission and distribution companies also own and operate 
transmission pipelines in their supply areas, although integrated with GTCL’s transmission 
pipelines. These transmission assets need to be unbundled at the accounting level. 
 
It is recommended to develop tariffs for transmission and distribution of gas, that will ensure 
both transmission and distribution companies sufficient funds for self-financing of their 
investment in expansions of the gas networks to accommodate future growth. 
 
RECOMMENDATION: EMPOWER BERC TO DETERMINE THIRD PARTY ACCESS TARIFFS 
FOR TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION OF GAS  
 
BERC regulatory capabilities should be enhanced to determine transmission and distribution 
tariffs for third parties to enable customers to buy gas at deregulated prices. Third party access 
to storage should be added when relevant. BERC should also issue licenses for import of gas, 
transmission, distribution, shipping and sale of gas. 
 
Network codes for transmission, distribution (and storage, when relevant) of gas should be 
developed by BERC. 
 
 
 
MAIN FINDING: REGULATORY INDEPENDENCE DOWNSTREAM BUT 
UPSTREAM INDEPENDENCE LACKING  
Although situated within the ministry, the setup of BERC provides a framework for independent 
downstream regulation through the Gas Act, the BERC Act, the funding provisions, appointment 
procedures and statutes. Petrobangla has a potential conflict of interest role as the upstream gas 
regulator, supervising and monitoring the PSCs and self-regulating its own operations, including 
its subsidiaries.   
 
 
 
  
 
  
195 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
RECOMMENDATION: CONSIDER MOVING THE TECHNICAL UPSTREAM REGULATION 
INTO AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY AND KEEP THE POLICY FUNCTIONS IN THE MINISTRY 
 
An independent upstream Regulator, for example BERC, separate from Petrobangla and the 
Ministry could potentially reduce potential conflicts of interests between Petrobangla, its 
subsidiaries and the regulated industry. It would be able to focus on regulatory functions only, 
and not have any policy functions, as they should be handled by the Ministry. This could create a 
more effective regulator to monitor and approve petroleum activities for compliance with 
regulations and work programs, collect and store data, manage bidding rounds and direct 
negotiations with petroleum investors, and granting PSCs. This could ensure a more timely 
execution of petroleum sector oversight, leading to increased activities and production in the long 
term. The 2006 Gas Sector Master Plan recommended an Upstream Licensing Authority to 
supervise and monitor the activities of the IOCs. This has not yet been implemented.  
 
Nevertheless, it needs to be acknowledged that a tie-in of upstream regulation and exploration 
activities by two different organizations/agencies can be a time-consuming event. Petrobangla’s 
experience of administering the PSC for last 30 years also needs to be recognised, such that 
Petrobangla’s focus to boost up exploration activities should be supported but not hammered if 
relevant authorities consider setting up an independent regulation agency in due course.

APPENDIX 3: GAS SUPPLY VIA INDIA  
 
Background 
India’s economic progress is closely linked to energy demand. As the economy expands, the need 
for oil and gas is expected to grow considerably. Due to increase in demand of Natural Gas, India 
decided to expand its in-house production of fossil fuel across the nation. Hence, vision 2030 has 
been formed to meet the supply demand of Natural Gas. Thereby, MoPNG (Ministry of Petroleum 
& Natural Gas) India started its survey across country for untapped fossil fuel reserve in remote 
areas as well despite ongoing political situations.  
 
The  Eastern  region  of  India  which  marks  the  border  for  Bangladesh  is  endowed  with  abundant 
resource of Natural Gas particularly Assam & Tripura, which started contributing to India more than 
2 centuries. The Natural Gas produced in Eastern region is being transported via pipelines to supply 
the Natural Gas requirements to several sectors like, Power & Fertiliser, Domestic & commercial 
industries.  
 
The  laying  of  new  pipelines  to  connect  Eastern  region  of  India  will  benefit  the  neighbouring 
countries  like  Bangladesh  and  Myanmar  to  have  transnational  gas  pipelines  for  their  country’s 
ongoing  and  future  demand  for  natural  gas.  The  last  part  of  this  section  provides  our  optional 
views/possibilities for the gas pipeline hook-up to connect with Bangladesh.  
 
Demand prediction in India 
The Power, Fertiliser, Industrial and CGD segments are expected to contribute to the bulk of future 
growth of natural gas demand in India. Natural gas demand from the power sector is expected to 
be driven, not only by the shortage of domestic coal supply and the rising cost of its substitute i.e. 
imported  coal  but  also  by  increased  domestic  gas  supply  and  power  sector  reforms.  Fertiliser 
industry  is  the  only  industry  that  uses  chemical  and  thermal  heat  of  gas  for  its  production  and 
remains  a  major  contributor  to  natural  gas  demand  in  the  country.  Due  to  latest  technology 
innovations  in  the  fertiliser  industries,  it  has  been  proposed  to  use  LNG  as  feed/raw  material 
replacement, leading to a higher demand from fertiliser sector. A higher emphasis on food security 
in India and increasing import price of urea are expected to drive the demand from the fertiliser 
sector.

Figure 100: Future India gas demand break-Up 
 
 
Supply prediction & plans in India 
Currently, the natural gas demand far exceeds domestic supply in India and the situation is likely 
to continue in the future. The country’s production of natural gas falling and additional demand is 
likely to be catered through LNG in the future or through transnational pipelines in absence of any 
large domestic discoveries, leaving the country to import natural gas as LNG from LNG exporting 
countries like Oman, Iran & Qatar.  
 
An Indian consortium comprising ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL) and Oil India 
Ltd (OIL)  won  a  bid  for  the  Farsi  block  in  2002  from National  Iranian  Oil  Co. (NIOC).  The  Farsi 
Block  has  an  in-place  gas  reserve  of  21.7  Trillion  Cubic  Feet  (TCF)  of  which  12.5  TCF  are 
recoverable. OVL is preparing a Master Development Plan for the gas field. Gas produced from the 
field  can  either  be  converted  into  LNG  by  freezing  at  sub-zero  temperature  and  shipping  in 
cryogenic ships to India or transported through a pipeline. 
 
LNG plays a critical role in partially bridging the gas supply gap in the country. India is currently 
the  world’s  fourth-largest  importer  of  LNG.  Currently,  India  has  the  infrastructure  to  annually 
  
 
  
211 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
import and re-gasify 25 MMTPA of LNG through the four terminals (Dahej, 10 MMTPA; Hazira, 5 
MMTPA;  Dabhol,  5  MMTPA;  and  Kochi,  5  MMTPA)  established  on  the  west  coast.  However,  the 
actual  import  capacity  is  less  than  17  MMTPA  due  to  lower  utilisation  of  the  Kochi  and  Dabhol 
terminals on account of pipeline connectivity issues and incomplete marine facilities. 
 
India has remained interested in sourcing gas through cross-border pipelines from countries like 
Turkmenistan,  Iran  and  other  Middle-East  countries  for  a  long  time.  The  Turkmenistan-
Afghanistan-Pakistan-India  (TAPI)  pipeline  is  proposed  for  transporting  Caspian  Sea  natural  gas 
from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan into Pakistan and then to India. India plans to import 30-
40 MMSCMD of natural gas from Turkmenistan through this pipeline, and negotiations are under 
way with Afghanistan and Pakistan over transit fee and other related matters. 
 
Earlier  to  TAPI  pipeline,  India  proposed  a  transnational  pipeline  which  will  transport  natural  gas 
from South Pars field in Iran via Pakistan and to India. But, due to some political and several other 
reasons this proposal is shelved. However, India is pursuing transnational pipelines to meet rising 
energy needs. The country is reliant on imports to meet about half of its natural gas needs. Hence, 
with  support  from  Russian  companies,  India  started  reviewing  the  possibilities  of  Iran-Pakistan-
India offshore pipeline in Arabian Sea. If this offshore pipeline comes into reality, India will have 
the required supply to meet its future demands. 
 
Presently, India is importing natural gas apart from indigenous natural gas productions in terms of 
LNG  to  meet  the  current  market  demands.  However,  if  the  aforesaid  pipeline  projects  rule  out, 
India has already planned to import more LNG from LNG exporting countries. There are a number 
of Greenfield and Brownfield LNG projects at different stages of conceptualisation and development 
on the eastern and western coasts of India. Their viability and actual development is also predicated 
on the emergence of a robust gas market in India, with an appropriate policy framework to address 
the challenges faced by different segments of the industry. 
Figure 101: LNG terminals India 
 
 
India is expected to have approximately 32,727 km of natural gas pipeline with a design capacity 
of 815 MMSCMD in place by 2030. However, the identification of new natural gas fields in India the 
  
 
  
212 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
supply point capacity to the markets is likely to increase to 582 MMSCMD. This capacity indicates 
the potential of the gas transport pipeline infrastructure to meet the demand in the country. 
 
India’s gas transmission infrastructure 
For a country with huge population and extreme growth in all means, the demand for Natural Gas 
across  the  nation  soars  every  day.  The  nation’s  MoPNG  encompass  its  gas  transmission 
infrastructure  in  terms  of  Gas  Pipeline  Network  to  supply  natural  gas  across  the  country.  India 
currently operates the longest Gas Transmission Pipeline connecting three major states (Gujarat, 
Karnataka & Andhra Pradesh). The gas transmission pipeline from these states is used to transport 
natural gas which is being produced in the country itself. The natural gas reserve in the country is 
on  lower  side  compared  to  the  current  demand.  Hence,  India  started  importing  LNG  form  Gulf 
countries as well. For LNG import India operates Dahej, Gujarat and Kochi as LNG import terminals 
mainly.  At  these  terminals,  the  LNG  is  re-gasified  and  transported  via  pipelines.  Based  on  the 
demand for natural gas in the country, design capacity of pipeline network in India is expected to 
reach 815 MMSCMD in 2029-30.  
 
The  Gas  Transmission  Pipeline  network  in  India  is  being  controlled  by  two  major  stake  holders 
(GAIL – Public Corporation and RGTIL – Private Corporation). 
 
GAIL 
Gas Authority of India Limited referred as GAIL operates the country’s 70% of gas transmission 
market. GAIL played a key role as gas market developer in India for decades catering to major 
industrial sectors like power, fertilisers, and city gas distribution. GAIL owns the country's largest 
pipeline network, the cross-country 2300 km Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur pipeline with a capacity to 
handle 33.4 MMSCMD gas. Presently, the company owns and operates a more than 11000 km long 
cross-country  Natural  Gas  Pipeline  in  India  with  presence  in  22  states  in  the  country.  GAIL  has 
been  given  the  responsibility  of  construction,  operation  &  maintenance  of  Jagdishpur-
Haldia/Bokaro-Dhamra  Pipeline  which  is  the  extension  of  existing  Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur 
pipeline.  
 
RGTIL 
In  the  recent  past,  a  private  owned  Gas  Transmission  Pipeline  Network  emerged  in  India  to 
transport natural gas to the rest of the country. The private gas transport pipeline is owned and 
operated by RIL (Reliance Industries Limited) in the name of RGTIL (Reliance Gas Transportation 
Infrastructure Limited). RGTIL laid a gas pipeline of 1460 Kms to transport natural gas from east 
coast of the country to west.  
 
The pipeline is referred as East West Pipeline (EWPL). The EWPL is currently transporting natural 
gas  produced  in  Kakinada,  Andhra  Pradesh  at  KG-D6  Block  to  Baurach,  Gujarat.  This  gas 
transmission supports Gujarat’s power sector and Fertiliser industries.  
 
RGTIL  is  now  planning  to  extend  its  Gas  Transmission  Pipeline  network  from  Kakinada,  Andhra 
Pradesh (East Coast) to North-East region and Southern region of the country. The extension of 
  
 
  
213 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
pipeline  for  these  2  regions  will  be  done  with  hook-up  possibility  in  the  GAIL  pipeline  network. 
Since, RGTIL/RIL has proposed LNG terminals which shall be referred as RLNG at East coast region 
and newly identified definitive natural gas resource in the deep locations of East coast.  
 
Figure 102: EWPL Route Map 
 
 
The  newly  proposed  pipelines  are  referred  to  as  Kakinada-Haldia  pipeline  (KHPL);  Kakinada-
Chennai pipeline (KCPL); Chennai-Bangalore-Mangalore pipeline (CBMPL); and Chennai-Tuticorin 
pipeline  (CTPL)  capable  of  carrying  around  80  million  metric  standard  cubic  metres  per  day 
(MMSCMD) of gas. However, MoPNG stated that the entire natural gas produced at KG-D6 Block 
will be given to the existing pipeline leaving no gas transport for the proposed pipelines by RGTIL. 
Hence, the MoPNG declined RGTIL’s interest on extension of gas pipelines on basis of declining gas 
production at KG-D6 Block.

Natural gas demand in east India 
The Government of India (GoI) announced a new agenda i.e. Power for All (PFA) jointly with every 
State  Government  in  India.  The  aim  is  to  achieve  24X7  availability  of  reliable  power  to  all 
  
 
  
216 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
households,  industrial,  commercial  and  all  other  electricity  consuming  entities.  Due  to  raise  in 
Global Warming awareness and other environmental impact, GoI has planned to produce electricity 
by Natural Gas and Solar energy. Hence, the demand for greener fuel is escalated in all parts of 
the country.  
 
Particularly, West Bengal located in the eastern region of the country is considered as the largest 
consumer  of  energy.  Hence,  to  provide  the  need  for  energy,  MoPNG  has  given  GAIL  the 
responsibility of natural gas transmission to the eastern part of the country. Though the eastern 
region of the country is identified with abundant resource of natural gas, the demand is still on the 
higher side. The lack in supply can be fulfilled by JHPL which is estimated/expected to transport 
the required demand by the region.  
 
Figure 103 represents the Gas Transmission Grid in India to meet the supply demand graph for 
current and future natural gas requirement.

APPENDIX 5: LESSONS LEARNED FROM GAS REGULATION IN OTHER 
COUNTRIES 
 
This appendix reviews lessons learned from gas regulation in other countries with an expanding 
natural gas sector with participation from international oil and gas companies, and who are 
considering importing (more) gas, have high population density, and strong economic growth. 
The countries whose gas sector the Consultant draws lessons from for the Update are India, 
Pakistan and Vietnam. 
 
Case study 1: Pakistan 
Background13 
Like Bangladesh, Pakistan projects a strong increase in gas demand over the next decades, and 
domestic gas production is expected to decline if no new discoveries are made. In 2015, the gas 
deficit was around 20 bcm (2000 MMCFD/d) and it is expected to triple. Several import projects 
are planned to fill the gap. In this respect, it is very similar to Bangladesh.  
 
The upstream gas sector consists of Government-controlled companies like the Oil and Gas 
Development Company Limited., OGDCL and Pakistan Petroleum Limited, PPL, local private 
companies and IOCs. The private companies produce around 50% of Pakistan’s gas output, 
OGDCL 28%, and PPL around 20%. 
 
Two partially Government-owned gas utilities; Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Ltd (SNGPL) and Sui 
Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGC), engage in the purchase, transmission, distribution, and 
supply of natural gas in Pakistan. They operate and maintain high-pressure gas transmission and 
distribution systems in their respective territories in the Northern and Southern provinces. In 
addition, independent pipeline systems supply gas to power and fertiliser plants. These are also 
owned partially by the government through OGDCL and Mari Gas Company Ltd. 
 
Petroleum policies 
The Government of Pakistan has issued Petroleum policies since 1991 and revised them on a 
regular basis. The latest is from 2012. It aims at attracting both local and foreign private sector 
investments in the Pakistani oil and gas sector. It determines the licensing process based on 
three onshore and one offshore Zones and provides four types of licenses. The system is based 
on Petroleum Concession Agreements in the onshore zones, and Production sharing contracts for 
the offshore zone. 
 
Gas exports is subject to the “L15” concept:  Gas reserves that exceed the net proven gas 
reserves, including firm import commitments, vis-à-vis the projected gas demand, can be 
exported. Given the current gas deficit, exports are hypothetical.

The E&P companies operating in Pakistan can sell their share of the gas to SNGPL, SNGC or to 
other transmission and distribution companies and to third parties (other than residential and 
commercial customers) at negotiated prices. Alternatively, E&P companies can request the 
Government to purchase 90% of their share of gas through a nominated buyer. They also have 
the right to sell 10% of their share of the gas to any buyer (with the consent of the Provincial 
Government). 
 
The Petroleum Policy and decisions by OGRA (the downstream regular, see below) allow for third 
party access to existing transmission and distribution pipelines. After an exclusivity period for 
SNGPL and SNGC to supply gas to their existing customers (which lasted until 2012), large 
consumers, such as industry and power, could in principle be supplied directly by gas producers 
through third party use of SNGPL or SSGC network up to a certain portion of their production.  
However, this has not worked in practice. 
 
Gas Pricing 
The price to producers for Associated or Non Associated Gas is linked to a basket of crude oil 
import in Pakistan. The Petroleum Policy determines a floor of $10/barrel of oil corresponding to 
a gas price of $1.75 per MMBtu, and applies a sliding scale up to a ceiling for the oil price of 
$110, resulting in a max price of $ 6 per MMBtu in Zone III, $ 6.6 per MMBtu in Zone I, and $8 
per MMBtu Offshore (Deep) and $9 per MMBtu (UltraDeep). 
 
OGRA advises GOP on the price of gas for each retail consumer category, and MPNR notifies end-
user tariffs for various tariff categories based on OGRA’s determinations.  
 
Upstream regulation 
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR) serves multiple roles in the sector, 
including policy-making, allocation of gas to various consumers, and regulation of upstream 
petroleum activity. MPNR also has a role in the setting of wellhead prices. The Government 
Holding (Private) Limited (GHPL) manages the Government's ownership interest in petroleum 
exploration and production joint ventures. GHPL is also a Licensee of the Government for 
Offshore petroleum exploration and production operation. 
  
MPNR’s mission statement14 is to ensure availability and security of sustainable supply of oil and 
gas for economic development and strategic requirements of Pakistan and to coordinate the 
development of natural resources of energy and minerals. 
 
The MPNR is responsible for dealing with all matters relating to petroleum, gas and mineral 
affairs. Its detailed functions are: 
  Policy, legislation, planning regarding exploration, development and productions policy 
guidelines to regulatory bodies in oil and gas sectors;

  Policy guidelines and facilitation of import, export, refining, distribution, marketing, 
transportation and pricing of all kinds of petroleum and petroleum products; 
  Matters bearing on international aspects; 
 
Federal agencies and institutions for promotion of special studies and development 
programmes; 
 
Facilitate the development of petroleum and mineral sectors; 
  Attract the private investment. 
 
The upstream oil and gas activities are regulated by the Directorate General of Petroleum and 
Concessions (DGPC), which is situated in MPNR’s Policy Wing as one of five directorates. The 
other directorates are Oil, Gas, Special projects (LNG), and Administration. 
 
DGPC functions are to: 
  Grant petroleum rights, i.e. reconnaissance permits, exploration licenses, development and 
production leases; 
 
Facilitate exploration & production and services companies/activities;  
  Analyse Oil and Gas fiscal regimes and recommend adequate policies in view of international 
practices; 
  Promote petroleum exploration, negotiations with foreign and local petroleum exploration 
companies;  
  Manage petroleum exploration, development and production operations in accordance with 
good international oil field practices, applicable rules and Petroleum Concession; 
  Ensure realisation of the Government receipts (dividend, royalty, rents, application fees etc.);  
  Compile investment data and manage and scale technical data. 
 
Downstream regulation 
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) regulates midstream and downstream activities of 
the oil and gas sector. OGRA was formed in 2002 to foster competition, increase private 
investments and ownership in the midstream and downstream petroleum industry and protect 
public interest. 
 
OGRA is independent from MPNR and the government-controlled companies, and is situated in 
the Government’s Cabinet Division. In the gas sector, OGRA regulates gas transmission and 
distribution, and Liquefied Petroleum gas (LPG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), and 
determines revenue requirement for transmission and distribution companies (including allowed 
Unaccounted-For Gas, or UFG).  
 
LNG 
Pakistan began importing spot cargoes of LNG in January 2016. Cargoes were delivered to the 
151,000 cob FSRU provided by Excelerate Energy. The FSRU is operated by Engro Elengy and 
was Pakistan’s first import terminal at the Port Qasim, Karachi and has a 690 MMCFD send-out 
capacity. 
  
 
  
223 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In February 2016, Pakistan signed its first long-term LNG contract with Qatar. Qatargas will 
supply fuel to state-owned Pakistan State Oil (PSO) from 2016 to 2031. The price for each LNG 
cargo in a particular month has been agreed at 13.37% of Brent where Brent value is average of 
the preceding three months. Qatargas will supply 3.75mn MT/yr of LNG to PSO. 
 
In October 2016, Qatargas and Pakistan’s Global Energy Infrastructure (GEIL) signed a 20-year 
LNG deal. According to the contract, Qatargas will supply 1.3mn MT/yr of LNG to Pakistan for 20 
years, with provisions allowing the volume to increase to 2.3mn MT/yr. The price is confidential. 
The LNG will be supplied from Qatargas 2 with the first cargo expected to be delivered to 
Pakistan in 2018 by Qatargas-chartered Q-Flex vessels. GEIL signed a long-term contract with 
Höegh LNG for a FSRU in Port Qasim in December 2016. The project is the first private LNG 
import terminal in Pakistan.     
 
Options for a more competitive gas industry 
The Government of Pakistan has been assessing the performance of Pakistan’s natural gas sector 
and developed options for the future direction of the sector towards a competitive and 
deregulated sector with increased private sector participation. This would among other things 
involve overcoming the current barriers to selling directly to customers at prices that are higher 
than today and at the same time fully cover costs, including future gas supply and LNG imports.  
To remove barriers to competition, the separation of trading and infrastructure operations and 
transmission and distribution are being discussed.  
 
A key issue to decide is the timing of the revisions to the regulatory framework, the restructuring 
of the gas sector and the price increases to cover the higher costs of future gas supplies.    
 
In general, options include: 
  Establish two markets for gas: The current low-priced gas supplied by SNGPL and SSGC 
to their customers at regulated prices and a market for new gas supply at (higher) 
deregulated prices.   
  How to introduce LNG imports? As a private sector import at unregulated prices sold to 
customers willing to pay the price? Or introducing regulation of the price for LNG? 
Introduce a single buyer in the form of a transmission company 
 
  
Provincial ownership 
An Amendment to the Constitution in 2010 changed the ownership of oil and natural gas in 
Pakistan. In particular Article 172(3) vests oil and natural gas resources jointly and equally 
between the Federal Government and the oil and gas provinces. Article 158 gives each province 
precedence over gas produced in its territory. Article 154 enshrines the provinces’ role in the 
Council of Common Interest (CCI).   
 
Lessons for Bangladesh 
Separate Regulation from policy function and operations 
  
 
  
224 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
BERC regulates the downstream gas sector in Bangladesh and is empowered to apply the 
provisions of the Gas Act. It is situated within the ministry. The downstream regulator, OGRA in 
Pakistan is independent from the Ministry, MPNR and the government-controlled companies, and 
is situated in the Government’s Cabinet Division.   
 
The regulation of the upstream sector is different in the two countries; 
The upstream oil and gas activities in Pakistan are regulated by the Directorate General of 
Petroleum and Natural resources (DGPC), situated in Ministry’s Policy Wing. The Government's 
ownership interest in petroleum exploration and production joint ventures is managed by a 
private Government Holding company.   
 
In Bangladesh, Petrobangla has a role as the upstream regulator, supervising and monitoring the 
PSCs. At the same time, petrobangla is the counterpart to the contracts which can pose potential 
conflicts of interests. The Government has authorised Petrobangla to enter into agreements with 
international oil companies on behalf of the Government. Pakistan’s upstream regulatory system 
is cleaner than that of Bangladesh; however, an independent agency would be even better placed 
to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Examples of countries with more independent upstream 
regulators are Canada and Norway. 
 
Petroleum policies 
The Government of Pakistan revises the Petroleum policies on a regularly basis to keep them up 
to date with development. Bangladesh issued a Petroleum policy in 1993. 
 
Provincial ownership of resources 
In Bangladesh, the Government has the ownership of the oil and gas resources. In Pakistan, oil 
and natural gas resources are owned jointly and equally between the Federal Government and 
the Provinces. The upstream regulator in Pakistan is under consideration to be re-organised. The 
first step of the reform is to separate the regulatory and the policy roles, and investigate how to 
integrate the Provinces in policy and regulation. This must be further advanced before a 
conclusion can be drawn about the impact and results on regulation. 
 
LNG Imports  
Pakistan has started importing LNG through a state-owned company and soon LNG will be 
imported by a private company as well. The costs of these imports are higher than the cost of 
indigenous gas production. Bangladesh should start a discussion on how to price the future 
higher LNG costs and which customers are going to pay the higher price. 
 
Case study 2: Vietnam 
Background 
The gas industry started in 1994 with the production of associated gas from the Bach Ho oilfields 
in the Cuu Long Basin in the South-East offshore continental shelf. This was followed in 2003 
when the first non-associated gas field came on stream in the Nam Con Son basin also in the 
South-East offshore, followed by other blocks in the same basin. 2007 saw the first deliveries of 
  
 
  
225 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
gas from the PM-3 development in the Malay-Tho Chu in the Phu Khanh in the South West 
offshore area, jointly administered with Malaysia, and more recently gas production began in the 
Song Hong basin in Northern offshore. This production is expected to increase gradually. The 
largest gas discovery in Vietnam, Blue Whale in the Central offshore is expected to come on 
stream around 2025. Other fields in the South West are under negotiation to be developed. 
Figure 104: Oil and Gas Basins in Vietnam 
 
 
The three gas producing areas are not connected by pipelines. In each case, the projects have 
been developed on a project-by-project basis to supply gas to power projects and in some cases 
fertiliser production as well. Very little gas is consumed by the industry. In 2016, Vietnam 
produced 10.7 bcm of natural gas15. Around 80% of the gas is consumed in power generation, 
11% in fertiliser production and 9% in industries. Gas accounts for around 15% of Vietnam’s 
energy matrix. Around one third of the country’s power is generated with gas and around three 
quarters of the fertiliser production. There is very little commercial and residential consumption 
of natural gas in Vietnam.

226 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gas production has been around 10 bcm since 2013 as production in old fields is declining. New 
fields are coming on stream replacing these fields and investments in infrastructure are 
overcoming bottlenecks, such as the capacity of the Nam Con Son pipeline.  
 
Gas Master Plan 
In January 2017, the Prime Ministry approved the Master Plan for Vietnam Gas Industry 
Development to 2025 with an outlook up to 203516. The goal is to achieve a gas production of 13-
19 billion cubic metres per year by 2025 and 4 bcm of LNG imports, and a production of 17-21 
bcm and up to 10 bcm of LNG imports by 2035. 
 
On the demand side, the plan will continuously develop the gas-fired power plants which should 
use about 70 – 80% of total production (including imports of LNG); develop an oil and gas based 
petrochemical sector, strengthen investment in natural gas processing; develop domestic 
industrial production; continuously sustain and extend gas distribution with an aim to protect 
environment and increase the value of gas use; at the same time develop low pressure and 
compressed natural gas distribution systems. 
 
PetroVietnam 
Vietnam Oil and Gas Corporation (Petrovietnam) is delegated by the government to carry out 
petroleum exploitation and exploration and signing oil and gas contracts. It also cooperates with 
international partners in either Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) or joint ventures for 
upstream operations and approve and supervise work programs of PSCs. In practice, 
PetroVietnam self-regulates. Under authority of the Prime Minister, Petrovietnam has the sole 
rights to buy gas offshore and to sell gas to end users.   
PetroVietnam’s subsidiary Petro Vietnam Gas Corporation (PV Gas) is responsible for the 
midstream and retail gas activities in Viet Nam. PV Gas has sole rights to distribution network 
development and sells gas to the state-owned power utility, Electricity Vietnam (EVN), to IPPs, 
and is also increasingly participating in downstream consumption of gas, including power 
generation facilities through its ownership of the Ca Mau power plant in the South West receiving 
gas from gas from PM-3, and at the Nhon Trach power complex receiving gas from Nam Con Son, 
and in fertiliser production as well. 
 
Gas pricing 
Gas pricing issues are dealt with project-by-project, rather than generically. Each project has 
been negotiated in its own rights with the IOC holding the license/PSC in terms of the volume, 
build up period, price and which customers to serve. For instance, for the first non-associated gas 
project, the pricing was negotiated by Petrovietnam with a consortium led by BP (which included 
a Petrovietnam stake) to supply gas from the Lan Tay and Lan Do fields in the Nam Con Son 
basin to the power complex at Phu My outside Hi Chi Minh City. With the addition of gas supply 
from additional fields in the Nam Con Son Basin and new power plants, including two IPPs, the 
total capacity reached 3,800 MW, and gas is also consumed in fertiliser plants at Phu My.

The price for gas delivered at Phu My was agreed at around USD 3.2 per mmbtu with an 
indexation of 2% p.a. when gas started flowing in 2003. This was higher than the price of the 
associated gas from Bach Ho, but still low by international standards setting an expectation of 
low gas prices for later developments. This expectation has delayed new field development as 
higher development and production costs have not been recognised and alternative fuel pricing, 
linking the gas price to the fuels it would substitute, coal, LNG, petroleum products, has not been 
considered.   
 
Legal Framework 
The Legal framework is summarised in Box. No 3. There is no independent gas regulator. The 
ministry is responsible for the state management of petroleum activities. PetroVietnam is 
responsible for technical regulation and self regulates (see previous section).

How to meet the objectives of the Gas Master Plan and LNG imports 
The objectives in the Gas Master Plan will be met in each of the four gas producing regions as 
follows: 
  
 
  
228 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Northern region:   
Find solutions for the collection of gas from the dispersed small fields with an aim to 
 
strengthen gas supply ability for industrial customers in the region  
  Study and invest in infrastructure for LNG imports to supply industrial customers and 
power plants, according to the Power Master Plan 
 
Central region:  
  Develop infrastructure to collect, transport and handle gas from Blue Whale field for 
supplying gas-fired power plants according to the Power Master Plan;  
  Develop petrochemical industry based on Blue Whale gas   
  Develop low pressure gas distribution system, and small-scale CNG/LNG for supplying 
industrial customers in the region 
 
Southeast region:  
  Strengthen exploration and field development to maintain gas supply in the region  
Invest in infrastructure for LNG imports to supplement the depletion of domestic gas 
 
production  
  Supply power plants according to the Power Master Plan 
 
Southwest region:  
Improve infrastructure to collect and transport gas 
 
Invest in infrastructure for LNG imports to sustain gas supply for customers and develop 
 
new power plants using LNG 
 
Options for a more competitive gas industry 
The lack of physical interconnection between the regional gas markets and the limits on the size 
of the markets are barriers for gas trade in Vietnam. The legal and regulatory framework 
described in Box no. 1 and Petrovietnam’s role in the gas sector does not support a development 
towards a competitive gas market. Petrovietnam is self-regulating and negotiates prices on a 
project by project basis, and PV Gas has the sole right to distribution network and sales to EVN 
and IPPs. There is no separation of policy making from economic regulation and no independent 
body responsible for economic regulation. 
  
The GMP projects an introduction of LNG in all four regions, probably in around five years. 
International LNG prices are higher than current gas prices in Vietnam and the start of the LNG 
imports could be a first step towards market based pricing. However, LNG is likely to be 
introduced before any market reforms which implies that Petrovietnam will import LNG and PV 
Gas will transport it, giving rise to a number of questions: 
  Would LNG be integrated as an additional supply source or a standalone supply option? 
Is it priced separately so that dual markets are established? And how would that impact 
 
the demand?

Conclusion  
Gas development in Vietnam has been delayed by the lack of a gas pricing policy and a market 
for gas. By negotiating projects and prices on a case by case basis, the industry has difficulty 
evaluating the financial returns on oil and gas production from prospective fields, and the 
government has difficulty deciding on an efficient development for energy resources and 
optimising the petroleum fiscal system to provide the right incentives and fiscal revenues. 
 
The three (soon four) regional gas markets in Vietnam are not connected by pipelines, which is 
not desirable from a supply security perspective and for the creation of a functioning gas market.    
Most of the gas is consumed by the power sector whose power transmission network connects 
the gas producing regions. 
 
The shortage of natural gas in Vietnam can be explained by the “circle of unsustainability”. The 
Gas Shortage shown at the top in the left panel in Figure 105  is due to insufficient investment  in  
domestic  exploration  and  lack of  clarity  and slow   decision-taking   on   the   price   for   gas   
in   new   developments. This leads to fewer investments in gas fired power generation and 
potential shortage of power. This is the “circle of unsustainability”. 
 
If clear pricing signal and market mechanisms for gas are introduced, investments in exploration 
and production will increase gas supply and more gas can be sold to the power sector increasing 
the power supply to fuel Vietnam’s large demand for power. This is the “circle of sustainability”.

Lessons for Bangladesh 
Develop an appropriate gas pricing policy 
The development of a gas pricing policy that meets the interests of the government, industry and 
consumers, sends clear pricing signals and is a step in the direction of developing a market for 
gas which will get Bangladesh into the “Circle of Sustainability”.   
 
Reconsider the role of the SOE 
Like Bangladesh, Vietnam has a dominant state-owned oil and gas company delegated by the 
government to carry out petroleum exploitation and exploration, signing oil and gas contracts 
and supervising IOCs operating in the sector. Its subsidiary, PV Gas, links gas from the upstream 
gas supplies to the end-users and has the sole rights to distribution pipeline development. 
This model can benefit the sector in the early stages of oil and gas development but also delay 
later developments due to potential conflicts of interest, self-regulation, and lack of independent 
regulation. 
 
Determine an LNG pricing policy 
Vietnam is planning to import LNG. The costs of these imports will be higher than the cost of 
indigenous gas production. Bangladesh should start a discussion of how to price the future higher 
LNG costs and which customers are going to pay the higher price. 
 
Case study 3 India 
Background 
In 2015, India produced 29.2 bcm of natural gas and consumed 50.6 bcm. The difference is LNG 
imports of 21.7 bcm, 13.5 bcm of which was imported from Qatar. 
 
Currently, the majority of gas is produced in the western offshore region and almost all of it 
comes from conventional hydrocarbon sources. Gas production is set to rise in the next four to 
five years as western and eastern offshore discoveries are brought into production. Chapter 4 
described the main public and private companies in the sector, the main transmission pipelines 
and demand centres, including planned projects and projections.   
 
This section will focus on the policy and the legal and regulatory framework in the gas sector in 
India. 
 
All minerals in India are owned by the state which holds exclusive authority to mine. India has a 
quasi-federal constitution where both the federal and the state governments have legislative 
powers. However, under the Indian constitution, only the federal government is empowered to 
make laws relating to regulation and development of oil and gas. Offshore licenses are granted 
by the federal government. Onshore leases are granted by the state government with prior 
approval from the federal government.  
 
 
 
  
 
  
231 of 244
 
 
 
 
 
 
Legal Framework 
Exercising its constitutional powers, the government passed the Oilfields (Regulation and 
Development) in Act 1948 and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules in 1959. Together, they 
regulate the grant of petroleum mining leases and provide the provisions for regulating 
petroleum operations and granting licenses and leases for exploration, development and 
production of petroleum in India.  From time to time, the government formulates policies under 
which concessions for exploration of oil and gas are awarded through a transparent competitive 
bidding system to private/foreign investors and national oil companies (NOCs) on the same fiscal 
and contractual terms17.  
 
The Petroleum and Minerals Pipelines (Acquisition of Right of User in Land) Act 1962 provides the 
framework for acquiring rights to lay pipelines for transporting petroleum, minerals and other 
connected substances. 
 
Government policies 
The Government formulated a policy called New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) in 1997. The 
main objective was to attract significant risk capital from Indian and foreign companies, state of 
art technologies, new geological concepts and best management practices to explore oil and gas 
resources in the country to meet rising demands of oil and gas. Since then, licenses for 
exploration have been awarded only through a competitive bidding system and NOCs are 
required to compete on an equal footing with Indian and foreign companies to secure Petroleum 
Exploration Licenses. Nine rounds of bids were concluded under NELP, in which production 
sharing contracts (PSCs) for 254 exploration blocks were signed18.   
 
The Integrated Energy Policy was developed by an expert panel of Planning Commission and 
adopted by the government in 2008. The policy seeks optimal exploitation of domestic energy 
resources and also vigorous exploration and acquisition of energy assets abroad, so that energy 
security can be attained effectively. The broad vision behind this policy was to create a regime to 
reduce dependence on imports and reliably meet energy demands with safe, clean and 
convenient energy at minimum cost. 19 
 
More recently, India announced a new Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy (HELP) to correct 
various issues that had arisen in NELP. These included separate policies and licenses for different 
hydrocarbons. New unconventional hydrocarbons (shale gas and shale oil) have entered the 
market. NELP was based on PSCs that have some well-known advantages and disadvantages. 
While the contractor takes the exploration risk, the Government pays the contractor costs back in 
the form of cost of oil or gas, which in most cases implies that the profit sharing of the oil and 
gas produced comes after the cost recovery of the contractor’s investments is completed

(depending on how much cost oil or gas that can be deducted each year). The process of 
approval of the contractor’s activities and their cost is a major source of delays and disputes 
between the government and the contractor in many countries. Another feature of NELP was the 
bidding system: exploration was confined to blocks that have been put on tender by the 
Government.20 
 
As for pricing under NELP, the producer price of gas was fixed administratively by the 
Government and royalties were uniform. They did not distinguish between shallow water fields 
and deep/ultra-deep water fields where risks and costs are much higher. 
 
The HELP introduces: 
  A single license to explore conventional and unconventional oil and gas resources. A uniform 
system covering all hydrocarbons (such as oil, gas, coal-bed methane, shale gas/oil, tight gas 
and gas hydrates).  
  Marketing and pricing freedom. Departing from earlier policies, the HELP introduces 
marketing and pricing freedom. The contractor will have freedom for pricing and marketing of 
gas produced in the domestic market. (see gas pricing below) 
  A Revenue sharing model. Production sharing contracts are replaced by Revenue sharing 
contracts that will be simpler, easier to administer and provide operational freedom, i.e. the 
contractor does not recover any costs directly, but retains a larger share of the revenue 
stream to cover the cost.   
  An Open Acreage licensing policy. Contractors can select exploration blocks throughout the 
year without waiting for the formal bidding round from the government.  
  A concessional royalty regime will be implemented for deep water (5%) and ultra-deep water 
(2%) areas. In shallow water areas, the royalty rates shall be reduced from 10% to 7.5%. 
 
Apart from HELP, the government also adopted the Marginal Field Policy in 2015 to bring 
marginal fields belonging to national oil companies (which have not been monetised to production 
as soon as possible. The first round of auctions for discovered small and marginal fields (67 fields 
in 46 contract areas) took place in 2016. The government used a revenue-based contract to 
auction its marginal fields. 
 
HELP also set up a central repository for E&P data, the National Data Repository for ease of 
access to existing data, for sharing and secure storage of data. 
 
Regulation 
Upstream 
The Upstream Regulator, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), was established in 1993 
under the administrative control of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas through Government of

India Resolution. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas manages and oversees upstream oil 
and natural gas exploration and production21.  
 
The DGH is the technical arm of the ministry and acts as a regulatory body having oversight on 
all concessions relating to oil and gas, including coal bed methane, shale gas etc. Objectives of 
DGH are to promote sound management of the oil and natural gas resources having a balanced 
regard for environment, safety, technological and economic aspects of the petroleum activity.  
Most of the manpower requirement of DGH is provided by the NOCs (ONGC, Oil India Limited, 
Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd., Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. 
and GAIL (Gas Authority of India Ltd). 
 
Downstream 
The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) regulates the midstream and 
downstream sector. It is an independent regulator constituted under the Petroleum and Natural 
Gas Regulatory Board Act 2006.  
 
The PNGRB’s objective is to protect the interests of consumers and entities engaged in 
petroleum, petroleum products and natural gas activities and to promote competitive markets. 
 
Pipeline regulation 
Permission to construct and operate both oil and gas pipelines is granted after a bidding process 
by the PNGRB under its regulations. The tariff for transporting oil and natural gas is determined 
by the PNGRB (Determination of Natural Gas Pipeline tariff) Regulations 2008. 
 
Third Party Access 
Third party access to pipelines and other infrastructure is permitted. The regulations provide a 
contract carrier system and a common carrier system to make excess capacity available for 
transporting natural gas or petroleum products through the pipelines. The period of use covers 
one year and the parties are free to agree their own terms within the confines of the law. The 
company laying, building, operating or expanding a common carrier or contract carrier pipeline 
has the right of first use for its own purposes. The common carrier capacity is allocated to any 
company seeking it on a "first come first served" basis. 
 
Gas pricing  
In 2014, the Indian government issued Gas Pricing Guidelines22. The Guidelines contain the 
following key features:  
 
The wellhead gas price is determined in USD per MMbtu based on a formula that includes 
 
annual average of daily prices at Henry Hub in the USA, the National Balancing Point in 
the UK, annual average of monthly prices at Alberta Hub in Canada, and Russia (Federal

Tariff) less the transportation and treatment charges (estimated at USD 0.50/MMBTU). 
It is reviewed and updated by the government every six months.  
 
For the North-East region, the government is to provide 40% subsidy on the price of 
 
gas.  
  With the new price guidelines there is no distinction between the previous Administered 
Pricing Mechanism (APM) and non-APM, and the price notified by the government under 
the policy is applicable to all gas produced in India (conventional, shale, or coal-bed 
methane), except in the following circumstances where:  
o  prices have been fixed contractually for a certain period of time;  
the PSC provides for a specific formula to index or fix the price of natural gas; 
o 
the PSC pertaining to the regime prior to the NELP does not provide for 
o 
government approval of formulae or the basis for gas prices;  
o  natural gas is produced from small or isolated fields in the nomination blocks of 
NOCs;  
o  gas is produced in the Krishna Godavari field (KG-D6). 
 
Since the gas pricing guidelines were issued there has been a shift in the government's policy on 
gas pricing towards more flexibility in the recent policy initiatives. The HELP policy introduced 
pricing and marketing flexibility for gas in the domestic market. The Marginal Field Policy 2015 
helped marginal fields and producers can charge a higher price for gas from discoveries in deep 
water/ultra-deep water/high temperature-high pressure areas.  
 
The latest price revision for the April-September 2017 period based on prices in international gas 
hubs set the wellhead price at USD 2.48 per MMbtu, and the ceiling for gas from difficult fields 
such as those in deep sea and high-pressure high-temperature areas, which is linked to 
alternative fuels, was set at USD 5.56/MMbtu23. Since the introduction in 2014, the wellhead gas 
price has dropped more than 50% due to the decline in international gas prices. 
 
Domestic wellhead gas prices have fallen below the average cost of production for many 
companies, such as ONGC and Oil India Limited, which have an average cost of production of 
USD 3.59 per MMBtu and USD 3.06 per MMBtu24  
 
Under the new price regime, there is no clear guideline on the end-user price mechanism. When 
the gas pricing guidelines were issued in 2014, they resulted in an increase in the wellhead price 
which raised the issue of pass-through of gas costs to consumers. The more than 50% decline 
since then has helped resolve this issue.    
 
Imported LNG prices are market-based. India has renegotiated contracts with Qatar since the oil 
and gas prices started falling in 2014 and the average import price is estimated to USD

Lessons for Bangladesh 
Separate Regulation from policy function and operations 
 
In India, the Upstream Regulator, DGH is the technical arm of the ministry and acts as a 
regulatory body having oversight on all concessions relating to oil and gas to avoid potential 
conflicts of interest between the NOCs and IOCs. 
 
Petroleum policies 
The Government of India issues policies on a regular basis, New Exploration Licensing Policy 
(NELP) in 1997, the Integrated Energy Policy 2008, and Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy 
(HELP) in 2017 to adjust to the country’s needs, to international markets and developments and 
to attract international investors. Bangladesh issued a Petroleum policy 1993 that has not been 
updated since. 
 
Gas Pricing  
The Government of India has linked domestic wellhead gas prices to international gas prices to 
attract international investors, and LNG is imported prices at international prices and passed 
through to the customers.

APPENDIX 6: KEY PETROLLEUM FISCAL TERMS FOR PRODUCTION 
SHARING CONTRACTS IN MYANMAR 
 
Three types of PSCs are awarded; onshore blocks, shallow water offshore blocks, and deep water 
offshore blocks. 
 
Deep Water Offshore: The exploration period is for three years and requires seismic in the first 
year, one well drilled in year 2 and in year 3. It can be extended one year two times. The 
production period is 20 years, signature bonus and data fee payable with 30 days of the contract 
signing. Royalty is 12.5 % of available petroleum. Cost recovery 50%-70% from 600-2000 feet 
water depth. Domestic Market Obligation 25% of natural gas of contractor’s share (at 90% of fair 
market value). State participation up to 20 % (25% if reserves are greater than 5 Tcf), income 
tax 25% (5 years tax holiday), 25% local content. If a significant discovery is made, the 
contractor submits an appraisal work program for approval. If commerciality of the field is 
determined, the contractor can go ahead on the terms in the PSC, although a renegotiation 
clause opens the possibility for renegotiation of the fiscal terms. 
 
The production split for gas is a sliding scale depending on water depth and gas production. In 
waters less than 2000 feet, the contractor receives 35% up to 300 MMcf/d, 10% over 900 
MMcf/d. Over 2000 feet, the contractor receives 45% up to 300 MMcf/d, 20% over 900 MMcf/d.

APPENDIX 8: FEASIBILITY STUDIES OF CURRENT PROJECTS  
 
For some of the pipeline projects is given a short summary with description of challenges and 
cost.  
 
Moheshkhali-Anowara   
For this project a feasibility study report is available from GTCL.  
 
The main parameters from the selected solution are:  
  Design throughput: 
1200 mmscfd 
Length: 
83 km 
 
 
  Design pressure: 
1135 psig 
  Dimension: 
42” 
  Wall thickness: 
19,1 mm API X 70 
 
The main cost break-down for this pipeline will is estimated to the following: 
Lakh Taka

The average cost per m and inch is hence 40, which we find normal for such terrain and including 
one big river crossing.  
 
The Consultants agree with the use of 42 inch pipelines, even if the capacity will not be fully used 
at the commissioning of the project. This is in order to prepare for future market development.  
 
Kutumbopur-Meghnaghat  
For this project a feasibility study report is available from GTCL.  
 
The main parameters from the selected solution are:  
  Design throughput: 
250 mmscfd 
Length: 
45 km

100% 
 
The average cost per m and inch is hence 69, which we find to be high, but can be explained by 
many river crossings, requiring foreign contractors.   
 
The Consultants find that with such high cost for land acquisition, crossing of rivers and need for 
a further strong East-West connection, a larger diameter pipeline should be chosen. Otherwise 
there will be a need for looping of the pipeline when LNG supply has to be transported to the 
West of the country. Depending on the technical possibilities, we recommend at least a 30 inch 
pipeline, but preferably a 36 or 42 inch line. This will also contribute to line pack capability for the 
power plant in Meghnaghat.

APPENDIX 9: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN BANGLADESH’S LNG 
IMPORTS  
 
Bangladesh has made speedy and impressive progress since the latest submission of this Gas 
Sector Master Plan. As part of this report update, some of the key developments are outlined as 
below: 
 
In order to set up an FSRU with the capacity of 1000 mmcfd (7.5 mtpa) at Payra, EoI is invited 
for short-listing potential terminal developer. Besides, Tokyo Gas Engineering Solutions (TGES) is 
conducting feasibility study to select sites in Moheshkhali/Payra/ any other suitable places for 
land based LNG terminal and in order select Terminal Developer for the Construction of the Land 
Based LNG Terminals in Moheshkhali/Payra or any other suitable places, shortlist has been made 
after evaluation of received proposals against EoI.  
 
Regarding LNG importation, the activities are as follows: 
 
To import LNG for Long Term Contract basis, Petrobangla and RasLaffan Liquefied Natural Gas 
Company Limited (3), Qatar have signed LNG Sales Purchase Agreement (SPA) for 15 (fifteen) 
years. 
 
Again, to import LNG, Petrobangla and Oman Trading International (OTI); Petrobangla and 
Pertamina (Indonesia) have signed separate MoU on G to G basis. It may be signed Long Term 
Contracts between them. 
 
Petrobangla and Astra Transcor Energy (Swizerland); Petrobangla and Gunvor (Singapore) have 
signed separate MoU and it may be signed Mid-Term contracts between them. 
 
To import LNG from Spot Market, shortlist has been made after evaluation of received proposals 
against EoI. 
 
The LNG pricing will be determined according to Oil index based Brent formula or Henry Hub 
formula as per contracts.

Objective and deadline 
With reference to the on-going project “Update of Gas Master Plan of Bangladesh” (contract 
package No. S-75) authorized to the Consultant (Ramboll Denmark A/S in cooperation with the 
Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) and EQMS) the present questionnaire aim 
to facilitate data and information transfer between Petrobangla and the Consultant. 
The Consultant kindly request response no later than 20th of March 2017 in order to include 
nature of response in the Interim Project Report due by 29th of March 2017. The Consultant also 
request for power to revert with clarifying questions. 
Introduction 
A Gas Sector Master Plan (GSMP) was prepared for Petrobangla and the World Bank by Wood 
Mackenzie Ltd. in 2006 with a time horizon to 2025. The update of the GSMP is designated to a 
time horizon to 2041, consequently the present questionnaire focus on the development in the 
gas field sector from present day to 2041.  
The main focus for the questionnaire is to update the Consultant on the present-day and future 
gas deliverability from the gas fields in Bangladesh. As the main focus of the update of the GSMP 
is the future gas demand-supply projection to strengthen a long-term plan for the development 
of the gas sector in Bangladesh it is critical that individual gas reserve numbers are documented 
as well as any assessment on future reserve increments. Further, the Consultants ask for 
  
242 of 244 
 
 
 
documentation for known plans for gas production augmentation and an assessment for the 
future potential (not yet planned).   
The questionnaire is divided into four sections; 1) exploration, 2) field development and 
operation, 3) production augmentation and 4)  current geo-scientific technology stock and human 
resources in the Public gas sector.  For each section a series of questions are listed and needs to 
be answered field by field and by prospects.
