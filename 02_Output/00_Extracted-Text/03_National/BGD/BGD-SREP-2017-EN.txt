such arrangements shall be consistent with the above requirements.
As per paragraph 5.4 of the Procurement Regulations, the “Letter of Acceptance of the World Bank’s Anticorruption

(c) sustainable procurement;

Regulations; and 
(e) best and final offer.
3. The  determination  of  whether  a  contract  meets  the  procurement  prior  review  threshold  is  based  on  the 
estimated  value  of  the  contract  or  the  package  -when  the  selection  document  contains  more  than  one

Invitation of Bids/Proposals No.__________
To:  ___________________________________________________________________________
We, along with our sub-contractors, sub-consultants, service providers, suppliers, agents (whether declared or 
not) consultants and personnel, acknowledge and agree to abide by the World Bank’s policy regarding Fraud and 
Corruption (corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive, and obstructive practices), as set out and defined in the 
World Bank’s Anti-Corruption Guidelines2 in connection with the procurement and execution of the contract (in 
case of award), including any amendments thereto.
We declare and warrant that we, along our sub-contractors, sub-consultants, service providers, suppliers, agents 
(whether declared or not), consultants and personnel, are not subject to, and are not controlled by any entity or 
individual that is subject to, a temporary suspension, early temporary suspension, or debarment imposed by a 
member of the World Bank Group, including, inter alia, a cross-debarment imposed by the World Bank Group as 
agreed with other international financial institutions (including multilateral development banks), or through the 
application of a World Bank Group finding of non-responsibility on the basis of Fraud and Corruption in 
connection with World Bank Group corporate procurement. Further, we are not ineligible under the laws or 
official regulations of [Insert name of Employer as per bidding document] or pursuant to a decision of the United 
Nations Security Council.
We confirm our understanding of the consequences of not complying with the World Bank’s Anti-Corruption 
Guidelines, which may include the following:
a. rejection of our Proposal/Bid for award of contract;
b. in the case of award, termination of the contract, without prejudice to any other remedy for breach of contract; 
and
2Guidelines  on  Preventing  and  Combating  Fraud  and  Corruption  in  Projects  Financed  by  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and 
Development Loans and the International Development Agency Credits and Grants, dated October 15, 2006, and revised in January 2011 
and July 2016, as they may be revised from time to time. 
6
c. sanctions, pursuant to the Bank’s Anti-Corruption Guidelines and in accordance with its prevailing sanctions 
policies and procedures as set forth in the Bank’s Sanctions Framework. This may include a public declaration 
of ineligibility, either indefinitely or for a stated period of time, (i) to be awarded or otherwise benefit from a 
Bank-financed  contract,  financially  or  in  any  other  manner;3  (ii)  to  be  a  nominated4  sub-contractor,  sub-
consultant,  consultant,  manufacturer  or  supplier,  or  service  provider  of  an  otherwise  eligible  firm  being 
awarded a Bank-financed contract; and (iii) to receive the proceeds of any loan made by the Bank or otherwise 
to participate further in the preparation or implementation of any Bank-financed project.
We understand that we may be declared ineligible as set out above upon:
a. completion of World Bank Group sanctions proceedings according to its prevailing sanctions procedures;
b. cross-debarment as agreed with other international financial institutions (including multilateral development banks); 
c. the application of a World Bank Group finding of non-responsibility on the basis of Fraud and Corruption in connection 
with World Bank Group corporate procurement; or 
d. temporary  suspension  or  early  temporary  suspension  in  connection  with  an  ongoing  World  Bank  Group  sanctions 
proceeding. 
For avoidance of doubt, the foregoing effects of ineligibility do not extend to a sanctioned firm’s or individual’s 
execution of its ongoing Bank-financed contracts (or its ongoing sub-agreements under such contracts) that are 
not the subject of a material modification, as determined by the Bank.
3 For the avoidance of doubt, a sanctioned party’s ineligibility to be awarded a contract shall include, without limitation, (i) applying for 
pre-qualification or  initial selection), expressing interest in a consultancy, and bidding, either directly or as a nominated sub-contractor, 
nominated consultant, nominated manufacturer or supplier, or nominated service provider, in respect of such contract, and (ii) entering 
into an addendum or amendment introducing a material modification to any existing contract.
4A nominated sub-contractor, nominated consultant, nominated manufacturer or supplier, or nominated service provider (different names 
are used depending on the bidding document) is one which has been: (i) included by the bidder in its pre-qualification or initial selection 
application  or  bid  because  it  brings  specific  and  critical  experience  and  know-how  that  allow  the  bidder  to  meet  the  qualification 
requirements for the particular bid; or (ii) appointed by the Borrower. 
 
7
We shall permit, and shall cause our sub-contractors, sub-consultants, agents (whether declared or not), 
personnel, consultants, service providers or suppliers, to permit the Bank to inspect5 all accounts, records, and 
other documents relating to the procurement process and/or contract execution (in the case of award), and to 
have them audited by auditors appointed by the Bank. 
We agree to preserve all accounts, records, and other documents (whether in hard copy or electronic format) 
related to the procurement and execution of the contract.
Name of the Bidder/Proposer/Consultant:
                                                          
Name of the person duly authorized to sign the Bid/Proposal on behalf of the Bidder/Proposer/ Consultant:
Title of the person signing the Letter:
