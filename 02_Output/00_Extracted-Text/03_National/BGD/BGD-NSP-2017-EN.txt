FOREWORD 
 
Its  my  pleasure  to  present  you  the  Bangladesh  Strategic  Plan  for  Agricultural  and  Rural 
Statistics-SPARS that was approved by Ministry of Planning on 27-07-2017. 
The Bangladesh SPARS translates the five core strategic goals with 37 output and 87 actions for 
improvement of agricultural  and rural  statistics  synergized with  the goals of National  Strategy 
for  the  Development  of  Statistics-NSDS,  National  Agricultural  Policy-NAP  as  well  as  7th  five 
year plans. 
The SPARS was prepared with the support of FAO in line with the Global Strategy to improve 
Agricultural  and  Rural  Statistics  (GSARS)-a  global  initiative  that  was  developed  under  the 
guidelines of United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and was endorsed in 2012 by United 
Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC). It will facilitate to buildup strong basis of agriculture 
and rural statistics in the country to provide data for monitoring Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). 
The document is a living one for the period of 2016-2030 and will be adjusted according to the 
changes  in  relevant  sector.  It  covers  all  statistics  somehow  aligned  with  agricultural  and  rural 
sectors  with  clear  emphasis  on  crops,  fisheries,  livestock,  agricultural  marketing,  land  water 
resource,  forest  and  environment  statistics.  The  clear  roadmap  that  has  been  depicted  in  the 
document  will  help  to  improve  statistics  related  to  above  issues  through  implementation  of 
stipulated actions. The reliable and timely data of agricultural and rural sector will contribute to 
the development prospects of this sector in Bangladesh.

Executive Summary 
 
Preparation of Strategic Plan for Agriculture and Rural Statistics (SPARS) for Bangladesh has 
been  done  by  adaptation  of  the  process  followed  in  developing  National  Strategy  for 
Development of Statistics (NSDS). The approach provides opportunity to the users to assess the 
current  status  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Statistics,  review  data  needs,  evaluate  the  degree  of 
integration  of  the  agricultural  sector  in  the  National  Statistical  System  (NSS)  and  develop  a 
medium  and  long-term  sustainable  perspective  addressing  key  constraints  in  meeting  data 
demands.  
 
The  Bangladesh  SPARS  is  prepared  in  line  with  Global  Strategy  to  improve  Agricultural  and 
Rural  Statistics  (GSARS).  The  GSARS  was  formulated  by  World  Bank  and  FAO  under  the 
guidelines  of  United  Nation  Statistics  Division  (UNSD)  and  that  endorsed  by  United  Nations 
Statistical  Commission  (UNSC)  in  2012.  In  line  with  Global  Strategy,    Bangladesh  Bureau  of 
Statistics (BBS) carried out the In-depth Capacity Assessment (IdCA) program with the support 
of FAO and published the report in 2014. The preparation of SPARS is also the continuation of 
fulfillment  of  proposal  I  recommended  in  IdCA.  Countries  having  the  national  plan  on 
improvement of national statistical system have been considered important in SDG document. 
  
The SPARS is a living document for the country to meet its medium to long term requirement 
for  strengthening  and  development  of  well-coordinated  and  integrated  agriculture  and  rural 
statistics  system  in  cooperation  with  relevant  ministries/departments  as  well  as  international 
agencies. The approach adopted ensures release of coherent, reliable, internationally comparable 
and timely  Agriculture and Rural Statistics (ARS).  
 
The  SPARS  has  given  emphasis  on  development  of  professionalism  in  the  statistical  work 
through  regular  training,  introducing  higher  course  in  statistics  and  close  connection  with 
Institute  of  Statistical  Research  and  Training  (ISRT)  of  University  of  Dhaka  and  Bangladesh 
Agriculture University. The restructuring the Agriculture Wing of BBS as well as  establishing 
statistical cell in planning wing of all ministries and departments has  also been recommended. 
Establishing  good  coordination  among  relevant  ministries/agencies  are  vividly  discussed  in 
SPARS. 
 
Considering  the  importance  of  reliable  statistics  for  measuring  SDG,  National  Five-Year  Plan 
and  other  strategic  plan,  focus  has  been  given  to  best  use  of  administrative  data  to  lessen  the 
burden on BBS as well as to increase the use of administrative records as official statistics. Clear 
guidelines have been provided in SPARS to address the issue.  
 
The  Bangladesh  SPARS  will  help  in  ensuring  availability  of  core  indicators  identified  in 
(GSARS). A census and survey calendar has been prepared (shown in Annexure-II) in SPARS 
that will give clear idea of number of census and surveys important for the country.  
 
The SPARS also identifies the areas like best use of ICT infrastructure for statistical purposes 
including data collection, processing and dissemination. It emphasized on continuous evaluation 
of data demand, common data management system and data sharing protocols. 
There are ten broad parameters of SPARS itself that is explained in introduction. These will help 
to understand the processes of implementation of SPARS activities. The SPARS has identified 
the necessity of statisticians in preparing national plans for getting technical support in assessing 
the progress of the plan.  
VI 
 
  
Five  Strategic  Goals,  37  outputs  and  87  strategic  actions/activities  have  been  identified  in 
SPARS for their achievement over the period 2016 to 2030. The Strategic Goals are as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Strategic  Goal  1:  Improve  competencies  of  National  Statistical  System  to  produce  and 
disseminate core set of ARS in accordance with international standards and best practices  
Strategic Goal 2: Strengthen partnership and coordination among Ministries / Departments 
and  attain  harmonized  definitions  and  statistical  practices  to  efficiently  produce  coherent 
ARS 
Strategic  Goal  3:  Strengthen  capacity  to  adopt  cost  effective  and  scientific  survey 
methodology using sampling frame based on Censuses 
Strategic  Goal  4:  Develop  a  comprehensive  human  resources  and  capacity  building 
mechanism  with  corresponding  organizational  setup  to  ensure  participation  in  policy 
formulation 
Strategic  Goal  5:  Improve  ICT  infrastructure,  develop  ICT  applications  for  collection, 
compilation  and  processing  of  ARS  and  establish  Integrated  Data  Management  and 
dissemination system 
  
The  document  has  been  developed  following  Result  based  Management  approach.  Hence, 
Logical Framework has been developed to identify output(s) to be achieved to meet each of the 
above  mentioned  strategic  goals.  Further,  corresponding  to  each  output,  number  of  strategic 
actions/activities has been identified. For each activity to get completed, Objectively Verifiable 
Indicators (OVI) has been identified. These would be used for reporting progress of SPARS.  
 
A  Committee  chaired  by  Secretary,  Statistics  and  Informatics  Division  and  co-chaired  by 
Director General, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has been proposed in SPARS for monitoring 
and evaluation of implementation of SPARS. The committee will evaluate the progress of it and 
provide direction for proper implementation of SPARS.

CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Bangladesh  is  the  country  with  distinct  agricultural  setting.  The  substantial  part  of  its 
typographically  and  climatically  diverse  economy  is  set  in  the  Sundarbans  Delta,  the  largest 
delta of the world. It is the most populous country in the world with 156.8 million populations 
(2014)  with  high  population  density  of  1063  person  per  sq.  km.  Sixty  six  percent  population 
lives in  rural  areas. Agriculture is  main occupation of the working population with  45 percent 
being engaged in these activities. Contribution of agriculture in GDP is more than 15 percent in 
2015-16.  Its diverse sub-sectors comprising of crops, livestock, fisheries and forests account for 
55 %, 14%, 22 % and 9% respectively in its agriculture economy.   
1.1 Importance of Agriculture and Rural Sector in Bangladesh 
 
1.1.1  There  is  paramount  importance  of  agriculture  and  rural  sector  in  Bangladesh  to  meet  its 
diverse  development  challenges.  The  agriculture  sector  is  the  major  contributor  to  sustained 
food, nutrition and livelihood security of its large population to achieve self-sufficiency in food 
production, reduce rural poverty and foster sustainable economic development. Development of 
agriculture  in  Bangladesh  is  therefore  accorded  high  priority  by  the  Government  with  special 
emphasis  on  agriculture  related  policies,  planning  and  informed  decision  making.  In  this 
process, the need for scientific measurement of changes in agriculture related indicators is duly 
recognized. It has, therefore, emerged timely availability of quality data on different aspects of 
the food and agriculture. Meeting such data demand requires concerted and organized efforts by 
various organizations dealing with agriculture related issues. The advancements in technology in 
capturing and analysis of data have opened new frontiers to interpret, understand and infer about 
the issues confronting the sector.  Statistical system is facing serious challenges in meeting this 
rising  demand.  There  is  a  need  to  improve  and  strengthen  the  system  with  specific  focus  on 
agricultural and rural statistics. 
 
1.2 Emerging Needs for Strategic Plan on Agricultural and Rural Statistics 
 
1.2.1  Creation  of  enabling  conditions  to  improve  statistical  system  and  taking  sustainable 
measures to improve timely availability of quality statistics is at the centre stage of strategies for 
increasing food security, reducing poverty and promoting overall economic growth. This aspect 
has been re-stressed in the 7th Five Year Plan (SFYP) of Bangladesh. One of the distinct features 
of contemporary planning process in Bangladesh is the emphasis on building up evidence based 
decision  making  and  periodic  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  development.  Towards  this  end, 
FYP document has made particular mention on need to improve system of relevant data in terms 
of quality, timeliness and adequacy.  
 
1.2.3  This  distinctive  recognition  of  an  efficient  data  system  incidentally  converges  with  the 
global context in which GSARS is evolved under the aegis of United Nations. The genesis of the 
GS was in the experienced prevalence of general weakness in the timely availability of quality 
statistics,  resultant  handicaps  faced  in  decision  making  and  universally  recognized  need  for 
desired  set  of  direct  and  derived  statistical  indicators  on  different  aspects  of  sector  for 
formulating  programs  and  policies.  The  main  objective  of  the  GS  is  to  reposition  the  national 
and  international  agricultural  and  rural  statistics  systems  to  meet  the  requirements  of  various 
stakeholders  for  monitoring  of  national  and  global  development  goals  in  synergy  with  the 
national  development  priorities.  Bangladesh  is  one  of  the  anchor  countries  in  the  Asia-Pacific 
1 
 
region  for  GS  implementation.  The  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations 
(FAO) has provided necessary support in this endeavour. 
 
1.2.4 One of the important elements of GS implementation is to develop SPARS in accordance 
with the national priorities and development plans, shared by all stakeholders. The Bangladesh  
SPARS  envisages  strategizing  its  goals  for  realization  of  GS  objectives  synergized  with  the 
national context, and articulated in its vision and mission.  It includes a concrete plan of action 
to implement it. SPARS process provides a means to raise the profile of agricultural  and rural 
statistics,  build  a  constituency  for  the  future  and  ensure  that  main  priorities  are  agreed  and 
shared by stakeholders. 
 
1.3 ARS to measure achievements for Sustainable Development Goals1 
 
1.3.1 Bangladesh is rigorously working on Sustainable Development Goals to achieve targets by 
2030.  The  goals  address  broad  range  of  issues.  These  17  SDGs  has  major  emphasis  on 
sustainable  development  and  has  focus  on  issues  like  inequality,  unsustainable  consumption 
patterns,  weak  institutional  capacity,  and  environmental  degradation.  The  2nd  SDG  goal 
articulated  as  “End  hunger,  achieve  food  security  and  improved  nutrition  and  promote 
sustainable  agriculture”  directly  concerns  the  agricultural  and  rural  development.  This  goal 
has  a  series  of  targets  to  support  the  three  interrelated  components:  ending  hunger,  achieving 
food security, improved nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture. There are 21 targets in 
all  the  SDGs  which  have  direct  impact  on  agriculture  related  activities.    Achieving  the  SDGs 
would be possible only if these targets are included in policy formulation, planning, budgeting, 
programme  development  and  implementation.  Therefore,  there  is  a  need  to  produce  the 
agriculture and rural statistics relevant to SDGs keeping in view the importance of this sector in 
the  context  of  Bangladesh  society  and  economy.    The  SPARS  provides  an  opportunity  for 
developing pathway towards taking agriculture development programmes for meeting the targets 
in SDG and monitoring the achievements. 
1.4 Broad parameters adopted in development of SPARS 
 
1.4.1  The  SPARS  process  is  an  adaptation  of  the  process  followed  in  developing  NSDS  of 
Bangladesh. The approach provides opportunity to the stakeholder to assess the current status of 
statistics, review data needs, evaluate the degree of integration of the agricultural sector in the 
National  Statistical  System  (NSS)  and  develop  a  medium  and  long-term  and  sustainable 
perspective addressing key constraints and data demand. Systematically designed SPARS, thus, 
will  be  a  living  document  for  the  country  to  meet  its  medium  to  long  term  requirement  of 
strengthening  well-coordinated and integrated agriculture and rural  statistics system, co-shared 
by  its  different  stakeholders  for  their  specific  data  needs.    The  SPARS  has  been  developed 
keeping the following parameters in view: 
(i) 
Complementary  to  NSDS:  The  SPARS  BD  is  a  document  complementary  to  NSDS 
goals especially in the areas of agriculture statistics. All the strategic goals and activities 
therein have to be in consonance with implementation of NSDS. 
(ii)  Medium  and  Long  Term  Strategic  Plan:  The  SPARS  is  designed  to  integrate 
agriculture  and  rural  statistics  into  national  statistical  system.  Although  this  is  a 
continuous process, the activities envisaged are expected to start immediately to achieve 
                                                           
1http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/news/communications-material/ 
 
2 
 
strategic  goals.  The  activities  are  to  be  taken  in  such  a  manner  that  SPARS  is  fully 
implemented by 2030. 
(iii)  Continuity:  The  SPARS  has  to  be  implemented  within  the  stipulated  time  frame.  But 
this will be a living document and will be adjusted over time. 
(iv)  Reliability and Accessibility: Main focus of the SPARS is to emphasize issues that will 
ensure the reliability of disseminated data and its accessibility to the users. 
Capacity  Development  for  Sound  National  Statistical  System:  Focus  on  the  sound 
national Statistical System has been given with due importance to agricultural and rural 
statistics.  This  will  characterize  professionalism  in  statistical  work,  organizational 
reform,  human  resource  management,  efficiency,  use  of  scientific  methodology  and 
ensuring evidence-based decision making. 
(v) 
(vi)  Effective  Coordination:  Specific  strategies  are  to  be  built  for  achieving  effective 
coordination between BBS and ARS dealing Ministries. 
(vii)  Delineation  Coverage  of  Agricultural  and  Rural  Statistics:  The  SPARS  has  to 
critically delineate the country specific scope and coverage of agriculture and rural sector 
keeping connection with the guidelines of Global Strategy. 
(viii)  Supply  of  Core  Statistics:  The  SPARS  has  to  emphasize  on  supply  of  core  set  of 
agricultural  and  rural  indicators  based  on  relevant  census  and  survey  data  as  well  as 
administrative data. This should support the country perspective as well as five-year plan 
and sectoral plan and SDG monitoring. 
(ix)  Data Analysis and Policy Interpretations: The SPARS would provide mechanism for 
statistical  analysis of census  and survey data with required policy interpretation  for the 
policy makers. 
International Comparability: The SPARS would ensure adoption of UN Fundamental 
Principles  of  official  statistics  as  well  as  the  guidelines  of  Global  Strategy  to  ensure 
international standards and comparability. 
Survey  Calendar  and  Log  Frame  Analysis:  The  SPARS  would  have  census  and 
survey  calendar clearly indicating the core census and surveys essential for Agriculture 
and Rural Statistics and with their periodicity. 
(x) 
(xi) 
(xii)  Monitoring  of  SPARS  Implementation:  For  implementation  of  SPARS,  a  committee 
chaired  by  Secretary,  SID,  Ministry  of  Planning  co-chaired  by  Director  General,  BBS 
has been proposed to monitor the proper implementation of Strategic Actions to achieve 
Strategic Goals of Bangladesh SPARS. 
1.5  SPARS Process in Bangladesh 
 
1.5.1 Overall direction for preparation of SPARS was given at the highest level of Government. 
SPARS  preparation  is  led  by  the  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BBS),  Statistics  and 
Informatics Division (SID), Ministry of Planning, Government of Bangladesh. The first phase of 
launching  the implementation of GS  in  Bangladesh commenced in  December 2013.  In 2014  a 
comprehensive  In-depth  Capacity  Assessment  (IdCA)of  its  system  of  Agriculture  and  Rural 
Statistics (ARS) and that of its national institutions engaged in production of core ARS data was 
made  by the  BBS  in  close  collaboration  with  various  departments  of  the  Government  of 
Bangladesh dealing in subjects relating to  agriculture and allied activities. This was done  with 
technical support of FAO.  
 
1.5.2  SPARS  has  been  designed  and  developed  using  two  tier  structure.  There  is  a  high  level 
Steering Committee headed by Secretary, SID and its members are senior officers from BBS and 
the line ministries dealing with agricultural and rural statistics as well as data users. This body 
3 
 
has all the powers to approve and implement activities relating to SPARS. This body is assisted 
by a Technical Working Committee headed by Director General, BBS which has members from 
the concerned data producing departments. Director, Agriculture Wing, of BBS is the National 
Coordinator for formulation of SPARS. 
1.5.3  Standardized  SPARS  designing  process  gives  due  consideration  to  existing  sub-sectoral 
institutional  and  administrative  structure  and  priorities  and  the  statutory  framework  of  official 
statistics in the country. It envisages determination of in-country governance structure to oversee 
the  integration  of  agriculture  into  the  NSS,  identification  of  country  specific  set  of  core  data 
items,  existing  gaps  in  data  availability,  assessment  of  resources  and  methodologies  in  vogue, 
the institutional and statistical methodology aspects related to integrate agriculture into the NSS, 
application  of  information  technology  and  data  management  requirements.  Development  of 
SPARS also ensures consistency and complementarities of future investments and resources in 
the system and sustainability of impact of interventions. 
 1.5.4  The  SPARS  designing  process  started  through  a  consultation  workshop  under  the 
Chairmanship  of  Secretary,  Statistics  and  Informatics  Division  (SID),  Ministry  of  Planning  in 
collaboration  with  all  stakeholders  involved  in  generating  ARS  on  15  November,  2015.    The 
workshop  was  attended  by  32  participants-  20  from  BBS  and  SID  and  12  from  different 
departments  concerned  with  agriculture  and  allied  activities.    The  workshop  deliberated  on 
issues, approaches, practices and institutional  arrangements for  effective  strategic planning for 
agriculture and rural statistics development. A meeting was held on 26 November, 2015 chaired 
by DG, BBS where different issues in preparing SPARS were discussed. In  a meeting on 30th 
March,  2016,  draft  SPARS  document  was  presented  to  the  Technical  Working  Committee 
(TWC) which constituted of 36 members from the different line departments. The draft SPARS 
was scrutinized in the meeting chaired by DG, BBS on 21 August, 2016 with all Directors of the 
different  wings and Project Directors, BBS, for incorporating additional comments and further 
observations  on  the  SPARS  document.  Later  on,  the  document  was  sent  to  the  relevant 
ministries/departments  for  comments/suggestions  and  was  improved  accordingly.    This 
document  along  with  the  earlier  document  was  discussed  in  BBS  in  a  meeting  chaired  by 
Director  General,  BBS  on  7  November,  2016  where  all  Directors  of  BBS,  representatives  of 
SID  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Livestock  and  concerned  agencies 
participated. This document has been modified based on the suggestions made in the meeting. 
1.5.5 The document on SPARS  was  placed  before the Technical  Working  Committee meeting 
on  23  February  2017  that  was  chaired  by  Director  General,  BBS.  Representatives  from  all 
relevant ministries/departments were present. The document was widely discussed and finalized 
there.  The  first  meeting  of  the  Steering  Committee  headed  by  Secretary,  Statistics  and 
Informatics  Division  was  held  on  4  May  2017.  The  final  meeting  of  Steering  Committee  was 
held on 22 May 2017 and the SPARS was approved in that meeting.  After the approval of the 
SPARS by the Government,  the implementation  of various activities under each strategic  goal 
shall commence.

CHAPTER II: INSTITUTIONS AND POLICY CONTEXT FOR ARS 
2.1 Institutional Framework of National Statistical System (NSS) 
 
2.1.1  After  the  independence  in  1971,  the  institutional  strengthening  and  organizational 
structuring in statistical system was done as the Government realized the necessity of forming a 
strong national statistical organization. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics was established in 1974 
consolidating Bureau of Statistics under Ministry of Planning, Population Census Commission 
under  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  Bureau  of  Agriculture  Statistics  and  Agriculture  Census 
Commission under Ministry of Agriculture. The  Statistics Division  was also  formed under the 
Ministry of Planning in  1975 to provide policy support and guidelines. The Statistics Division 
was further renamed as Statistics and Informatics Division in 2013 with greater responsibilities. 
The NSS Bangladesh has evolved as a centralized system with Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics 
(BBS) is the lead and a nodal institution for generating, coordinating and disseminating official 
statistics on various social and economic aspects of the country. 
 
2.1.2  BBS  is  the  major  source  of  key  agricultural  and  rural  statistics.  It  has  experience  in 
conducting four agricultural censuses since the country’s independence.   The Annual Survey on 
Crop  Production  is  one  of  the  priority  surveys  of  the  BBS,  generating  annual  area  and 
production estimates  for  126  crops, which include major  crops such  as  aus, aman, boro  (three 
paddy crops), jute, potato and wheat. The BBS also collects price statistics and brings out price 
indices and other macroeconomic aggregates. 
 
2.1.3  The  NSS  Bangladesh  includes  not  only  the  BBS  but  also  various  Ministries  and  public 
agencies  that  participate  in  collection  and  dissemination  of  statistical  data.  Decentralized  and 
distinct  administrative  and  management  responsibilities  assigned  to  sub  sectors  of  agriculture 
viz, crops, livestock, fisheries, forestry etc. has also resulted in decentralization in the statistical 
system.  
 
2.1.4 Recently enacted Statistics Act, 2013 is an institutional milestone of NSS in Bangladesh. 
The  Act  entrusts  the  BBS  with  the  responsibility  for  collection,  compilation,  analysis, 
dissemination  and  coordination  of  all  types  of  statistics  including  agricultural  statistics  in  the 
country  in  a  methodological  and  timely  manner.  The  Act,  in  Clause  Ga-6  mandated  BBS  to 
conduct Population Census, Agriculture Census, Fisheries and Livestock Census and Economic 
Census. It also empowers BBS to conduct all types of surveys including agriculture related and 
land  use  surveys.  It  may  be  mentioned  that  an  approval  from  BBS  will  be  required  if  any 
organization  likes  to  conduct  survey.  Thus,  the  Act  has  entrusted  BBS  with  the  functions  of 
supporting,  coordinating  and  endorsing  the  statistics  generated  and  disseminated  by  other  line 
ministries, departments  and organisations.  This,  in  the long  run, is  expected to  streamline the 
methodological and reporting differences of many key national statistics, enhance credibility of 
statistics and improve access and availability to different users and stakeholders. 
 
2.2 Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics 
 
2.2.1 The BBS is the National Statistical Office (NSO) authorized and mandated for collection, 
processing,  dissemination  and  coordination  of  almost  all  major  official  statistics  of  national 
importance.    The  key  functions  of  BBS  are  to  organize  and  conduct  national  censuses  & 
statistical  sample  surveys,  management  of  human  resources 
their  capacity 
development,  create  and  organize  a  unified  service  for  all  statistical  personnel,  advise  and 
including 
5 
 
coordinate statistical works for all offices of the government and authenticate statistics produced 
by the other departments for maintaining statistical standards. 
2.3 Aligned Ministries and Departments 
2.3.1 Not all activities concerning agricultural statistics are carried out by the BBS and there are 
also  some  important  activities,  such  as  generation  and  dissemination  of  fisheries  statistics  that 
are  organised  in  a  decentralised  manner  by  the  Department  of  Fisheries  (DoF)  under  the 
Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Livestock  (MoFL).    On  some  other  subjects,  such  as  livestock  and 
poultry,  generation of statistics is  not regular and  well-organised.  There are sporadic and less 
statistically structured data collection/compilation activities carried out by other agencies such as 
the  Department  of  Agricultural  Extension  (DAE),  Department  of  Agricultural  Marketing 
(DAM),  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forest  (MoEF),  Bangladesh  Agricultural  Development 
Corporation (BADC), Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) etc.  
2.3.2 Outside the NSO, very little statistical activities are performed to generate data and even if 
they have been performed, standard operating procedures are lacking. Most noticeable statistical 
activities  in  the  line  departments  are  by  Department  of  Fisheries  and  Bangladesh  Forest 
Department.  The  annual  fisheries  statistics  of  Bangladesh  is  released  since  1982  by  the 
Department  of  Fisheries  (DoF).  Statistics  on  forest  area  cover  and  forest  produce  is  generated 
through administrative procedures of  Bangladesh  Forest  Department.  Department  of  Livestock 
Services also  uses  statistics for its  subsector but  there is  no systematic statistical  operation for 
this purpose.  
2.3.3  Ministry  of  Agriculture  also  undertakes  surveys  for  monitoring  of  crops  and  prices  of 
commodities  albeit  without  proper  statistical  considerations.  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  has 
the mandate of management, development  and  efficient use of water  resources in the country. 
Irrigation and water statistics is compiled by the Ministry. Information is regularly available for 
major  irrigation  projects.  However,  there  are  some  methodological  and  use  of  appropriate 
classification related issues in the data collected. No information is at present available on minor 
irrigation. 
2.3.4 Some of these statistics do get  generated out of the administrative procedures. Important 
among these are statistics on agricultural trade and rural credits (Bangladesh Bank), government 
budgetary  support  to  agriculture  sector  (Ministry  of  Finance)  and  rural  infrastructures  such  as 
rural electrification and communication. 
2.3.5 Different departments use statistics for their respective sectoral requirements. Most prolific 
user of ARS for informed decision making is Food Planning and Monitoring Unit (FPMU), for 
its mandate to manage food security situation in the country. Besides data on availability of food 
and its distribution in the country, FPMU is also concerned with the early warning system on the 
domestic  and  international  availability  of  food  as  well  as  market  indicators.  Planning 
Commission  and  Ministry  of  Finance  are  other  important  user  organisations  of  specified  ARS 
statistics for informed decision-making.  
A list of user organizations along with source of data providing organization is at Annex-I 
2.4 Coordination Mechanism in NSS 
2.4.1 Prior to the Statistics  Act,  2013, the highest  advisory body of  the BBS  was the National 
Statistical  Council  to  meet  periodically  to  take  broad  policy  decisions  and  consider 
recommendations on collection, compilation and dissemination of statistics. In the provisions of 
the Statistics Act, the apex decision body to approve the broad technical and policy issues of the 
6 
 
BBS  is  the  Steering  Committee  (SC),  headed  by  the  Secretary,  Statistics  and  Informatics 
D+ivision  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning.  There  is  a  Technical  Committee  (TC)  headed  by  the 
Director General, BBS to look into technical details and operational issues. Besides these, inter-
ministerial effort to synchronize statistics of greater national interest is also underway.  
2.4.2 During the consultations for the NSDS it became clear that the links between the BBS and 
other  producers  were  very  limited  and  immediate  improvements  in  coordination  were  needed. 
NSDS  also  considered  for  establishing  the  Statistical  Cells  of  the  BBS  in  the  key  line 
departments.  The establishment of statistical  cells  is  significant  in  data production, to  promote 
consultation and coordination and such cells are envisaged to provide overall management and 
policy  guidance  to  the  ministries  and  to  review  and  harmonise  all  statistical  concepts, 
classifications  and  methods  used  by  them  in  data  collection,  processing  and  dissemination. 
Furthermore,  they  will  be  responsible  for  compiling  statistics  from  the  data  of  the  respective 
ministry.   
2.4.3 The NSDS also provides for signing Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) between the 
BBS  and  other  agencies  so  as  to  build  a  strong  and  sustainable  relationship  with  them.  
Furthermore, it seeks to use, where possible, the field strength of the ministries/agencies during 
censuses or large scale surveys, which will help accelerate the statistical work and improve data 
quality at low cost.      
2.5 National Strategy for the Development of Statistics-NSDS 
2.5.1  Focusing  on  the  needs  of  all  data  users,  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  prepared  the 
National  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Statistics  (NSDS)  in  2012  in  consultation  with  a 
number  of  development  partners  and  agencies.  The  NSDS  document  states  that  the  Vision  of 
NSS Bangladesh is to become a world-class provider of authentic, relevant and timely data 
in  a  holistic  and  user-friendly  manner.  It  inter  alia  promotes  better  generation  and 
dissemination of statistics and strengthens all statistical services so that they meet the needs of a 
rapidly  developing  nation,  ensuring  availability  of  comprehensive  and  coherent  statistical  data 
while making effective and efficient  uses  of national  resources.  The formulation of NSDS has 
taken  note  of  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  NSS  and  stated  the  Mission  of  the  NSS  (1)  to 
establish an integrated, professional, efficient and effective national statistical system, under the 
guidance and leadership of the BBS; and (2) to produce official statistics that meet the current 
and evolving needs of national and international users in a transparent and timely fashion, using 
international standards and the best statistical practices. 
 
Proposed NSDS priorities for the next ten years within the proposed budget and capacity:  
 
i. 
Focusing  on  improving  the  quality,  coverage  and  use  of  core  statistics  required  for 
national  planning,  economic  management  and  for  monitoring  progress  towards 
national goals.   
Strengthening the professionalism of the national statistical system, which involves: 
increasing the skills and expertise of the work-force and increasing the proportion of 
the staff with professional qualifications; providing strong professional leadership for 
BBS  and  the  statistical  system  generally;  and  developing  and  strengthening  internal 
procedures to make the statistical system more open and accountable and to build trust 
in statistical products.   
Enhancing capacity to collect, compile, disseminate and, especially, use statistics at 
the  local  level,  providing  statistical  information  to  help  empower  the  citizens  of 
Bangladesh.  
Promoting and strengthening access to and the use of official statistics at all levels of 
society, based on an “open-data” strategy.

2.5.2 The NSDS is to be implemented through the BBS with responsibility shared by its eight 
wings.  NSDS  recognizes  the  importance  of  coordination,  both  internally  within  BBS  and 
externally with other departments. Strong coordination set up has been created in BBS through a 
Committee  chaired  by  Director  General  to  monitor  implementation  of  activities  under  NSDS. 
Directors of the BBS and Directors from other departments are members of the committee.  
 
2.5.3  NSDS  has  also  laid  emphasis  on  improvement  of  quality,  coverage  and  timeliness  of 
agriculture and related statistics using latest ICT and space technology. 
 
2.5.4 During the consultations for the NSDS it became clear that the links between the BBS and 
other producers were very limited and immediate improvements in coordination were needed.  
2.5.5  NSDS  also  considered  for  establishing  the  Statistical  Cells  of  the  BBS  in  the  key  line 
departments.  The establishment of statistical  cells  is significant  in  data production, to  promote 
consultation and coordination and such cells are envisaged to provide overall management and 
policy  guidance  to  the  ministries  and  to  review  and  harmonise  all  statistical  concepts, 
classifications  and  methods  used  by  them  in  data  collection,  processing  and  dissemination. 
Furthermore,  they  will  be  responsible  for  compiling  statistics  from  the  data  of  the  respective 
ministry.   
2.5.6 The NSDS also provides for signing Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) between the 
BBS  and  other  agencies  so  as  to  build  a  strong  and  sustainable  relationship  with  them.  
Furthermore, it seeks to use, where possible, the field strength of the ministries/agencies during 
censuses or large scale surveys, which will help accelerate the statistical work and improve data 
quality at low cost.      
2.6 National Plans (Perspective & Five Year) 
 
2.6.1  The  7th  Five  Year  Plan  (FYP),  referencing    2016  –  20202  identifies  the  contemporary 
national  priorities  and  the  vision  for  the  development  of  agriculture  sector  to  ensure  food  and 
nutritional  security,  enhancement  of  sustainable  intensification  and  diversification  of  climate 
resilient  agricultural  production  with  increased  commercialization,  livelihood  improvement 
through  technological  innovations  and  use,  strengthening  of  research  and  extension  system, 
developing  marketing  extension,  value  addition  of  agricultural  products,  and  linking  farming 
community  with  markets, both  local  and global.  National  planning process  assigns key role to 
subject  Ministries  to  implement  government  policies  and  programmes  and  in  developing  and 
implementing projects.  
 
2.6.2  Despite  several  constraints  faced  by  the  farm  sector  and  food  security  concerns  in  the 
country, there has been encouraging response to the stimulus provided by the successive Plans 
and sub sector policies.  
2.7 Sub Sector Policies 
 
2.7.1  In  addition  to  the National  Agriculture  Policy3formulated  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture 
and updated from time to time, respective policies on fisheries, livestock, as well as environment 
and forestry are formulated and directed by the respective Ministries. This is in consonance with

the  need  to  address  the  recent  developments  and  the  problems  concerning  the  overall  food 
sector, involving different ministries and departments dealing with inputs, resources, production 
and distribution of food commodities.  
 
2.7.2 The National Food Policy for food management and food security connects with all these 
sub-sectors  policies.  The  policies  framed  by  different  departments  are  synergised  with  the 
overall  planning  and  development  priorities  of  the  government.  The  National  Food  Policy 
envisages  wider  statistical  input  for  addressing  food  management  and  food  security.  Statistics 
not only relating to crop production and the inputs and resources used for crop production but 
also  to  distribution,  availability,  access  and  consumption  by  the  people  are  required. 
Accordingly,  the  plan  of  action  for  the  Food  Policy  has  statistical  input  on  the  aspects  of 
marketing, storage, prices, distribution and availability not only from domestic production but in 
the situation of deficit availability  from  imports or other sources, stocks, employment, income 
and consumption of diversified food for proper nutrition. 
2.8 Policy Derivative on NSS 
 
2.8.1  There  is  an  expanding  demand  for  statistics.  The  7th  FYP  expressed  the  limitation  of 
quality and timely data experienced in the past. It has invoked an inbuilt mechanism of Result 
Based Monitoring and Evaluation of set targets and goals entrusting Planning Commission the 
focal point of M & E Strategy and specifying prime role of BBS to generate data and indicators 
and its analysis for the purpose. A brief of agriculture sectoral strategies and policies in 7th FYP, 
summarised  in  table  below  supplements  the  SPARS  development  in  consonance  with  the  sub 
sector requirement.

2.9 In-depth Capacity Assessment of ARS 
 
2.9.1 The recently completed In depth Capacity Assessment (IdCA)4 to produce Agriculture and 
Rural  Statistics  in  Bangladesh  as  a  part  of  implementation  of  Global  Strategy  to  improve 
Agricultural and Rural Statistics (GSARS) reviewed all the major statistical activities relating to 
agriculture and  rural  sector carried out  by  BBS and the line departments, their methodologies, 
data users’ needs and gaps, data duplication and resources availability in different agencies.  
2.9.2 The review brought to notice the strengths and weakness in NSS in producing agricultural 
statistics. The  IdCA also took  note of the issue of duplication in  crop production estimates by 
BBS and Ministry of Agriculture. Some of the user departments found to be lacking appreciation 
of statistics in their respective fields of work.  
2.9.3 The comprehensive assessment has been made in the context of minimum set of core data 
and  its  availability.  The  identified  core  data  are  mapped  on  the  agencies,  responsible  for  their 
generation.  Several  datasets  relating  to  minor  crops,  livestock,  fisheries,  forestry,  farm-gate 
prices and data on environment were observed to be suffering from one or more deficiencies.   
2.9.4  Some  key  observations  from  the  IdCA  capacity  assessment  synthesis  are  availability  of 
strong  legal  framework  and  existence  of  appropriate  institutions  to  produce  ARS  which  is  in 
consonance  with  the  observation  of  NSDS.  It  has,  however,  identified  need  for  a  separate 
strategy  for  agriculture  statistics  removing  financial  and  human  resource  constraints,  specially 
training and capacity development. It has also recognized the need for capacity development in 
user departments to strengthen agricultural market and price information, fisheries and livestock 
and water statistics. Gaps in several core data and the statistics also needed to be addressed to 
prepare  food  balance  sheets,  commodity  balances  for  crops,  stocks,  livestock,  and  agro-
environmental indicators.  
2.10 SWOT Analysis of Agricultural and Rural Statistics

CHAPTER III:  REVIEW OF ARS DATA SYSTEM 
 
3.1 Overview of Agriculture and Rural Statistics 
3.1.1  Profile of agricultural and rural statistics has expanded in coverage over years. This now 
includes  crops,  livestock,  fisheries  and  forestry  cross  cutting  with  the  economic,  social  and 
environmental  dimensions.  Besides  the  activities,  production,  size  and  magnitude  of  farm 
entrepreneurship,  the  aspects  of  trade,  resources,  inputs,  processing,  prices,  infrastructure 
demographic  and  social  economic  aspects  of  well-being,  macro-economic  indicators  and 
environmental data relating to land water and air now fall under the ambit of ARS. This diverse 
data dimension on one hand is to meet requirements of different stakeholders on the other hand 
it  has  to  provide  meaningful  inference  to  address  the  aspects  of  food,  livelihood  security  and 
well-being of the people.  
3.2.2  There  is  expectation  from  the  system  of  ARS  to  provide  coherent  and  consistent  set  of 
data.  Traditionally  the  system  of  ARS  was  seen  from  the  perspective  of  crop  statistics.  In  the 
contemporary context, the statistics on subsectors of livestock and fisheries, production system 
and  market  information,  value  addition,  consumption,  income,  employment  have  also  become 
significant. These statistics need to be sourced from several statistical operations. Some of these 
statistical  operations  such  as  population,  economic  and  agricultural  censuses,  crop  surveys, 
social economic surveys and  administrative reporting systems  are  carried out  by the  NSO and 
remaining information  may be provided by other agencies. Such statistical  operations together 
form the system of ARS. There remains considerable unmet demand of data in the system.  
3.2.3 The limitations and constraints in the NSS in general and system of ARS in particular have 
often  surfaced  in  recent  years.  The  plan  to  improve  system  of  ARS  having  multiplicity  of  the 
institutions and statistical  operations with  the respective strengths  and weaknesses necessitates 
strategic thinking and approach.  
3.2 Main Statistical Operations related to BBS 
3.2.1  Main  statistical  operation  to  generate  statistics  on  agriculture  and  rural  sector  is  the 
Agriculture Census periodically conducted by the BBS. There is considerable improvement in 
the conduct of decennial Agriculture Census over the years. The Agriculture Census 2008 was 
fourth  in  the  series  and  was  more  comprehensive  in  geographic  and  data  coverage  to  provide 
several  benchmark  indicators  on  the  aspects  of  farm  and  non-farm,  rural  urban  operational 
holdings  in  size  class,  land  and  crop  use  with  irrigation  and  variety  particulars,  livestock 
holdings  and  livestock  population,  some  aspects  of  fisheries,  agricultural  labourer,  farm 
machinery  etc.  The  population  and  economic  censuses  are  also  major  statistical  operations 
providing statistics on select social and economic dimensions of ARS.  
3.2.2  Amongst  the  surveys  generating  ARS,  Agricultural  Crop  Production  (ACP)  survey 
conducted by BBS is one of the main source of national and sub-national estimates of crop area 
and production for 126 crops. For six major crops, Aus, Aman  and Boro paddy and jute, wheat 
and potato,  the yield estimates are based on  crop cutting experiments. ACP adopts household 
interview approach to estimate area of all the crops and yield for the remaining 120 minor crops.  
3.2.3  Other  statistical  operations  by  BBS  concerning  ARS  are  ad-hoc  surveys  on  cost  of 
cultivation  for  select  crops,  survey  for  crop  forecast  for  major  crops,  household  surveys  on 
income  expenditure  for  determination  of  prevalence  of  poverty,  labour  force  surveys  and 
computation of national accounts that includes agriculture as sub sector in GDP.  
11 
 
3.2.4 The BBS also holds responsibility of dissemination of ARS through publications, survey reports and 
through  its  website.  BBS  is  the  nodal  agency  for  human  resource  management  of  statistical 
professionals  engaged  with  NSO  and  also  associated  with  ARS  and  foster  partnership  for 
development and improvement in methodologies. 
3.3 Major Gaps in ARS 
In  IdCA,  all  the  major  statistical  activities  carried  out  by  BBS  and  the  line  departments,  their 
methodologies, data users’  needs and  gaps, data  duplication, resources  availability in different 
agencies, were reviewed with a view to identifying strengths and weakness in NSS in producing 
agricultural statistics. Several data relating to minor crops, livestock, fisheries, forest data, price 
data and data on environment have been observed to be suffering from one or more deficiencies, 
as summarised in the table below:

Chapter IV: Vision, Mission, Strategic Goals, Outputs and Activities for 
ARS 
4.1 Planning Process 
4.1.1 The strategic evolution of a comprehensive plan of action for sustainable strengthening of 
agriculture and rural statistics involves consultative synthesis of national  statistical system and 
its  institutional  framework.  This  also  addresses  diverse  data  demand  of  the  multifaceted 
agriculture  and  rural  sector  in  the  perspective  of  national  plan  and  development  policies.  This 
document  has  prioritised  statistical  activities  to  be  performed  in  medium  to  long  term  in  an 
integrated manner. The Strategic Plan has to be cost-effective and should meet the expectations 
of  different  stakeholders.    Following  the  approach  of  NSDS,  the  SPARS  has  defined  mission 
and vision statement  for Agriculture and Rural Statistics System followed by its strategic goals, 
outputs and the activities to be taken up to achieve targets. Thus, the SPARS is a results based 
plan of activities resulting in  outputs meeting strategic  goals  and ultimately  achieving mission 
and vision of SPARS. 
4.2 SPARS Vision and Mission 
4.2.1 Based on the discussion with stakeholders comprising of users and producers of agriculture 
and rural statistics the following reflects the Vision of Agriculture and Rural Statistics System in 
Bangladesh. 
 
 
The Vision of SPARS is: 
 
Agriculture and Rural Statistics System is to be a well-coordinated, integrated and 
efficient  system  conforming 
the 
requirements of stakeholders 
 
international  standards  and  meeting 
to 
 
 
4.2.2 To achieve this vision, the mission of the system is the following: 
 
 
The Mission of SPARS is:

Produce  and  disseminate  agricultural  and  rural  statistics  (ARS) 
transparent, timely and user friendly manner, adopting international standards, 
best  practices  and  latest  technologies  through  strengthening  the  capacity  of 
producers  with  human  and  financial  resources  to  meet  contemporary  and 
evolving needs 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.3 SPARS Strategic Goals 
 
4.3.1 The SPARS planning process is basically aimed at helping the stakeholders of agricultural 
statistics  system  to  identify  achievable  goals  reflecting  the  reality  as  highlighted  in  the 
assessment of the current status of the agricultural statistical system and designed to accomplish 
14 
 
above stated vision and mission. Core element of SPARS is identification of strategic goals and 
related  outputs  that  are  aimed  to  be  accomplished  in  a  realistic  and  feasible  manner  in  the 
implementation phase (5-10 years).  
 
4.3.2  Considering  the  multiplicity  of  the  factors  and  crosscutting  issues  identified  in  the 
assessment, the strategic goals are identified keeping in view the multi-dimensional aspects  of 
institutions,  statistical  operations  and  methodologies  dovetailed  to  subsector  characteristics, 
human resource and infrastructure, technology and interface with stakeholders and development 
partners. 
4.4   Strategic Goals in SPARS of Bangladesh

4.5  Goal-wise outputs and related strategic actions/activities 
 
4.5.1 Strategic Goal 1: Improve competencies of National Statistical  System 
to produce and disseminate core set of ARS in accordance with international 
standards and best practices 
The capability of BBS and Ministries/departments dealing in agriculture related subjects is to be 
strengthened in producing useful and reliable statistics. There is also need to promote statistics 
friendly attitude amongst the staff in these Ministries.  
To  produce  reliable  statistics,  National  Quality  Assurance  Framework  for  all  the  census  and 
surveys  need  be  developed.  There  is  also  need  to  establish  system  of  maintaining  Statistical 
Business Process Model (SBPM) in all ARS. Obligation in following the QAF will increase the 
credibility of statistics and would ensure international comparability. 
 
FAO  recommended  core  set  of  indicators  have  suitably  adapted  in  the  context  of  the  country. 
There has to be awareness of these indicators amongst relevant Ministries/Departments so that 
these  indicators  could  be  used  for  achieving  targets,  and  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of 
progress. These indicators should also be available to other stakeholders.  As BBS has the legal 
mandate to produce all basic indicators of all the sectors, it also has the responsibility to support 
and  coordinate  the  statistical  activities  carried  out  by  other  Ministries/Departments  and  finally 
endorse these products.  
 
It is essential to ensure the ARS generated in the country is internationally comparable. For this, 
it  is  necessary  that  recommendations  of  FAO  for  conducting  census  and  surveys  and  the 
guidelines  and  statistical  principles  set  by  UNSD  are  strictly  followed.  It  is  also  necessary  to 
assess and utilize the experiences and good practices of other countries. These experiences are 
shared  through  relevant  Global  and  Regional  Committees  and  therefore  participation  in  these 
committees would be useful for improvement of competencies of ARS in the country.

(NSS)  so  that  the  policy  and  decision  making  process  in  the  Government  becomes  evidence 
based.  The NSDS has identified the process of strengthening the NSS including Agriculture and 
Rural  statistics.    The  primary  goal  of  SPARS  is  to  develop  strategy  for  improvement  of 
16 
 
agriculture and rural statistics. As this sector is concerned with the large number of Ministries 
and Departments, it is important to establish organisational set-up in those ministries/department 
to smoothly deliver the reliable statistics in timely manner.

4.5.2  Strategic  Goal  2:  Strengthen  partnership  and  coordination  among 
Ministries  /  Departments  and  attain  harmonized  definitions  and  statistical 
practices to produce coherent ARS 
Establishing partnership between BBS and other line ministries at an optimum level is the key 
factor to develop agricultural statistics. For the whole agriculture sector, production statistics of 
crops, fisheries and livestock and their prices are very important.  For this,  strong coordination 
among  BBS,  DAE,  DoF,  DLS,  and  DAM  is  required.  NSDS  has  clearly  recommended 
maintaining  good  coordination  with  line  ministries/departments  through  Memorandum  of 
18 
 
Understanding  (MoU).  BBS  will  start  working  immediately  with  DAE,  DoF,  DLS  and  DAM. 
Statistics Act, 2013 has mandated BBS to produce official statistics. It also empowered BBS in 
streamlining the data generated by line ministries. BBS is to support, coordinate and endorse the 
data  generated  by  other  line  ministries/departments  to  avoid  data  duplication  in  government 
agencies. 
Outputs under the goal: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)  Harmonized concepts and definitions used by all ministries/agencies of ARS 
(iv)  More administrative data used as official statistics 
(v) 
Efficient production of coherent and consistent agriculture and rural statistics 
Improved coordination between BBS and other data producing agencies of ARS 
Increased participation of stakeholders for assessing data demands 
 
Output 2.1: Efficient Production of coherent and consistent agriculture Statistics 
The primary goal of SPARS is to produce coherent and consistent agriculture and rural statistics.  
One  of  the  key  factors  for  development  of  ARS  is  close  partnership  and  coordination  of  BBS 
with agriculture related Ministries. There is a need to form a committee duly recognized under 
the  Statistics  Act,  2013  for  coordination  and  monitoring  the  process  of  implementation  of 
SPARS.  
There  is  also  need  to  issue  a  notification/  Government  order  from  BBS  clearly  stating  the 
statistical  products  to  be  brought  out  by  each  Ministry/Department  in  agriculture  related 
activities along with periodicity and timeliness.  
 
Strategic actions/activities: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Development of integrated calendar for Census and surveys for ARS 
Organize regular training with updated manual for field staff 
 
Output 2.2 Improved Coordination among data producing agencies of ARS 
To achieve better coordination among agencies engaged in production of ARS, it is necessary to 
prepare a compendium of standard concepts and definition used in ARS. This would be required 
to  be prepared in  close  cooperation  and consultation with  all the concerned departments.  BBS 
will have to take the responsibility of bringing out this compendium. In this process, inconsistent 
definitions,  if  any,  would  also  get  streamlined  and  uniform  and  internationally  accepted 
definition would be adopted and used for future data collection and dissemination. Preparation 
of  MoU  among  other  related  ministries  /departments  will  facilitate  to  improve  the  quality  of 
ARS product. 
According to the responsibilities stipulated in MoU, coordination with related departments will 
be done. The MoU can be prepared on the basis of following matrix;

(iii)  Establish coordination through MoU for defining responsibilities 
(iv)  Appoint focal point official of line ministry/department to BBS for coordination 
 
Output 2.3 Harmonized concepts and definitions used by all ministries/agencies of ARS 
BBS has to take initiative to harmonize the concepts and definitions related to ARS that is used 
by  different  ministries  and  departments.  This  activity  is  prime  to  avoid  discrepancies  of  data 
among the agencies. Necessary publication on all the definitions and concepts will be prepared 
and circulated. 
Strategic actions/activities: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Prepare compendium of standard concepts and definitions on ARS

ministries 
Collaborate line ministries/agencies to preserve administrative records systematically 
(ii) 
Output 2.5 Increased participation of stakeholders for assessing evolved data demands 
BBS  needs  to  institutionalize  the  mechanism  for  continuous  assessment  of  data  demand  of 
stakeholders.  For  this,  BBS  can  organize  consultation  workshop  on  stakeholder’s  opinion. 
Assessment  of  data  needs  through  structured  questionnaire  is  essential  instrument  to  identify 
current data needs. 
BBS needs to be familiarized with the changing concepts and domains of agricultural activities. 
The sustainable agriculture and the Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) are the issues like that. 
BBS needs to  collect  this type  of data to  facilitate decision making process  through providing 
data on current issues and practices. 
Strategic actions/activities: 
(i)  Conduct ad-hock survey on data demand  
(ii)  Organize meeting/consultation workshop on use of agricultural and rural statistics 
(iii) Assess SDG indicators/other relevant policy documents and determine data gap 
 
4.5.3 Strategic Goal 3: Strengthen capacity and adoption of cost effective and 
scientific survey methodology using sampling frame based on Censuses 
To achieve the goal, the following ten (outputs) are planned to be generated. These outputs will 
be achieved by set of activities described in each case.  
Outputs under the goal:

division/district/upazila/union/  mauza  levels.  To  measure  inter-censal  annual  changes,  sample 
surveys  are  being  conducted  to  provide  estimates  with  minimum  time,  cost  and  effort.  The 
statistical  sample  survey  methodology  adopted  for  the  purpose  provides  information  close  to 
actual information. This information is effectively used in estimation of value addition of sector 
to  GDP,  food  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  sectoral  progress  and  policy/  plan

BBS is planning to conduct next Agriculture Census in 2018 covering crops, fisheries, livestock, 
and  forestry  and  environment  sectors  in  an  integrated  manner  following  modular  approach  to 
data  collection.  This  approach  will  be  cost-effective  for  generating  reliable  ARS  and  will 
increase  the  scope  for  analysis  covering  social,  economic  and  environmental  dimension  of 
activities  in  the  sub-sectors.  This  integrated  approach  to  Census  and  Survey  planning  will 
facilitate establishment of sampling frames to support future surveys.  
The forthcoming Agriculture Census is intended to comply with the recommendations of FAO 
World Programme for Census of Agriculture (WCA 2020) which is  for the period 2016-2025. 
The modular approach proposed to be followed in Agriculture Census 2018 will be an extension 
of the modular approach used in the last Agriculture Census 2008 with a view to capture more 
data  on  items  keeping  in  view  the  demands  from  sub-sectors  of  fishery  and  livestock.  The 
census  will  be  designed  keeping  in  view  follow-up  surveys.  Core  Census  module  will  collect 
data on structural items which will be more or less the same as the Agriculture Census 2008 so 
as to allow measurement of change since the last census. Key questions on fisheries, livestock 
and forestry will be included to provide crucial structural data on these sectors.  
Strategic action/activity: 
(i) 
Conduct agriculture census covering crops, fisheries and livestock sub-sectors 
Output 3.2 Sampling Frames using census data base for annual survey on production of 
crop, fisheries and livestock developed 
One of the essential prerequisite for conducting scientifically designed statistical surveys is the 
Sampling  Frame.  A  suitably  designed  Census  provides  such  frames  for  follow  up  surveys  for 
more detailed data aspects. Considering a very large data requirement on the diverse aspects of 
crops,  livestock  and  fisheries  and  the  gaps  and  limitations  in  the  existing  data  system,  it  is 
22 
 
envisaged to develop sample frames from the agriculture census.  The annual production survey 
on crop, fisheries and livestock, cost of production and other agriculture related household and 
farm survey would be conducted on the basis of master sample frame. 
There  has  been  recommendation  of  FAO  that  follow  up  surveys  should  be  carried  out  using 
Sample frames which may help  integrate data on different  aspects.  Further, issues  relating to 
food security or poverty can be properly understood only if it is possible to analyse the data in 
comprehensive  manner.  However,  keeping  in  view  the  conditions  in  each  country  some 
integration should be achieved.  
BBS itself will prepare sampling frames for annual crop production, fisheries and livestock and 
other related survey with the adequate involvement of DAE, DoF and DLS. 
 
Strategic actions/activities: 
(i) 
Develop Sampling Frames to meet requirement of crop, livestock, fishery and forest 
surveys 
Establishing  a  Census  /Survey  Methodology  Wing  in  BBS  for  guiding  the  survey 
designs for the surveys to be carried out by BBS and other ministries/ department   
(ii) 
Output 3.3 Census and Survey Calendar related to ARS followed 
To  facilitate  long  term  sectoral  plan,  food  management,  estimating  contribution  to  GDP  and   
market  price  data  available,  there  should  be  programme  of  census  and  survey  that  would  be 
conducted regularly or ad-hock basis. Keeping this into consideration the evolved census/survey 
calendar (appendix-) needs to be followed.   
Strategic action/activity: 
(i) 
Conduct  Agriculture,  Fisheries  and  Livestock  Census  and  other  necessary  Surveys 
following Census/survey calendar 
Develop methodology and generate data on good agricultural practices 
(ii) 
 
Output 3.4 Annual crop production survey conducted using improved methodology 
The  economic  contribution  of  crop  sub-sector  to  Gross  Domestic  Production  annual  crop 
production  estimation is  inevitable. For the sake  of accurate GDP  calculation, the annual  crop 
production  (acreage,  yield  and  total  production  data  and  their  economic  value  needs  to  be 
calculated  using  improved  methodology.  BBS  has  taken  substantial  steps  to  improve  crop 
estimation  methodology  with  the  support  of  FAO.  This  also  includes  production  forecasting 
fore  casting  and  crop  monitoring.  The  survey  method  has  been  recommended  for  crop 
forecasting.  On  the  other  hand,  using  econometric  model  as  well  as  RS  data  is  also 
recommended for crop forecasting.

Output 3.5 Annual fish production survey conducted using improved methodology 
The  annual  production  of  fish  is  required  for  many  purposes.  One  of  them  is  to  know  the 
economic value for GDP calculation. The Department of Fisheries is  currently  providing this 
estimation using the methodology as well as sample design that requires being up-dated. After 
the  Agriculture  Census  2018,  the  new  sampling  frame  will  be  reconstructed  for  reliable  and 
authentic estimates of annual fish production. Department of Fisheries will have to take support 
from BBS in this regard.

Bangladesh  has  been  facing  serious  difficulty  in  getting  latest  and  current  information  on 
output  of  livestock  products.  At  present  the  information  for  years  subsequent  to  the  year 
Agriculture  Census  is  carried  out,  is  projected  based  on  past  trends  and  other  ancillary 
information.  This  does  not  reflect  the  correct  situation.  There  is  a  need  to  take  up  specific 
annual survey for the purpose.  Thus, the activity for the purpose is to design and implement 
Integrated Sample Survey for Livestock Products. BBS may do this with close cooperation of 
Department of Livestock Services. 
Strategic action/activity: 
(i) 
Design integrated sampling frame for livestock and conduct annual survey 
Output  3.7  Annual  surveys  on  input  costs  of  crops,  fisheries  and  livestock  conducted 
using improved methodology  
Survey on cost of production is used mainly for the purpose of government procurement and for 
GDP calculations (value addition issues). As it is very important BBS needs to conduct regular 
input  cost  survey  for  major  cereal  crops  and  input  cost  survey  for  other  crops,  fisheries  and 
livestock  with  certain  periodicity  to  improve  this  information.  For  improvement  of  these 
estimates, FAO guidelines on input cost survey may be useful. 
Strategic actions/activities: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)  Design and conduct input cost survey for livestock production on regular interval 
Design and conduct annual input cost survey for major cereals and other crops 
Design and conduct input cost survey for production of fish on regular interval

(iv)  Design and conduct survey on supply chain and value chain of crops, fisheries and 
livestock production 
Design and conduct livestock resources survey on half decadal basis 
(v) 
Output 3.8 Annual food balance sheet prepared 
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics has recently prepared Food Balance Sheet for the years 2009 
to  2013  under  the  support  of  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO)  of  United  Nations.  
This  work  has  to  be  continued  and  annual  Food  Balance  sheet  should  be  prepared  for  each 
year. A time line in this regard also should be decided. 
Strategic action/activity: 
(i) 
Prepare food balance sheet annually 
Output 3.9 Survey on Private Food Grain Stock conducted 
In  consideration  of  supporting  the  scientific  food  management,  annual/ad  hock  survey  on 
measurement of private stock of food grain in essential. BBBS is conducting this survey for the 
first  time  in  2017  with  support  of  FAO.  BBS  may  follow  the  guidelines  provided  by  FAO 
describing the sapling frame/methodology and the questionnaire of this survey. This survey is 
crucial as the marketable surplus of food grain can be known through this survey. 
Strategic action/activity: 
(i) 
Conduct annual/ad-hock survey on private stock of food grain survey on supply and 
value chain 
Output 3.10 Survey of irrigation systems conducted 
Bangladesh has regularly compiled information related to major large irrigation projects. The 
information  from  these  projects  relates  to  area  cultivated,  type  of  crops  etc.  However,  the 
information on irrigation by minor irrigation systems is not captured. There is a need to carry 
out  such  survey  so  that  comprehensive  information  on  irrigation  is  available.  There  are  also 
some  issues  relating  to  definitions  and  concepts  used  in  collection  of  information  at  present. 
There  is  a  need  to  develop  survey  guidelines  keeping  in  view  international  standards.  The 
survey of minor irrigation projects should be introduced. 
Strategic action/activity: 
(i) 
Develop survey guidelines and conduct survey on irrigation 
Output 3.11 Survey on Land Use conducted  
There is a need to adopt latest land use classification in land use surveys specially keeping in 
view  the  emerging  demands  from  SDGs  for  sustainable  development  and  measurement. 
25 
 
Therefore,  the  Land  Use  classification  presently  in  use  should  be  revisited  in  the  context  of 
latest guidelines and adopted.  
 
Strategic action/activity: 
(i) 
Revisit land use classifications and compile land use statistics 
Output 3.12 Survey on forest product conducted 
There  are  many  forest  products  and  its  economic  value  which  may  not  be  available  in  other 
surveys. Specialized type of survey is needed to be conducted for this. 
Strategic action/activity: 
(i) 
Conduct survey on forest products 
Output 3.13 New databases to measure Natural Resources (land, Water and Air) changes 
developed 
There  is  increasing  concern  towards  natural  resource  management,  degradation  of  natural 
resources and its effect on climate change. Sustainable Development Goals have placed special 
emphasis  on  sustainability  of  such  development  processes  which  do  not  adversely  affect 
natural resources. There are sporadic data collection on the issues relating to Soil degradation, 
pollution  in  water  especially  due  to  agricultural  practices  adopted  or  fishery  activities 
undertaken and emission in the environment specially emission due to agriculture. There is  a 
need to develop guidelines for collection of regular information on each of the parameters to be 
identified  after  detailed  deliberations  keeping  in  view  the  context  of  the  country  and 
international standards. The parameters have to be representative of various provinces, Zila and 
Upazilas  so  that  action  points  may  be  identified.  There  would  be  requirement  for  interaction 
with  the  officers  of  the  concerned  Ministries/  Departments  and  also  outside  experts. 
International expertise may also be required for the purpose. 
Strategic action/activity: 
(i)   Conduct survey on soil degradation, water pollution, air pollution and emission in the 
environment due to agriculture 
4.5.4  Strategic  Goal  4:  Develop  a  comprehensive  human  resources  and 
capacity building mechanism with corresponding organizational setup  
The  capability  of  Ministries/Departments  dealing  in  agriculture  related  subjects  is  to  be 
strengthened in producing useful and reliable statistics. It is also necessary to promote statistics 
friendly attitude amongst the staff dealing various subjects in these Ministries. There is a need to 
develop  a  comprehensive  human  resource  development  plan  for  ARS  system.    The  human 
26 
 
resource  plan  will  be  based  on  engaging  adequate  work  force  having  statistics  background  in 
BBS and Ministries/Departments to establish sound statistical system in the country.

Output 4.1 Qualified personnel in BBS and other ministries/departments having statistics 
background available 
Recruiting sufficient  number of  statistics graduates in  BBS is  the prime  step.  In  each ministry 
and department, statisticians should be recruited to prepare data base through systematic use of 
administrative  data/records.  For  this,  each  ministries/department  will  have  to  create  posts  of 
statisticians in their own organizational set-up. They will work in coordination of BBS and will 
be able to  formulate their administrative data in  a systematic way. This  will help  in  preparing 
data bases of their own and increase the use of statistics.  
Strategic actions/activities:

planning  and  plan  formulation.  Statistical  officers  from  BCS  (Statistical)  cadre  under  the 
administrative  control  of  Statistics  and  Informatics  Division,  Ministry  of  Planning  can  be 
appointed  in  these  positions.  These  officers  will  work  in  ARS  related  Ministries  to  coordinate 
with  BBS  and  other  Ministries/Departments.  They  will  also  help  in  developing  data  bases  by 
extracting  the  information  from  the  administrative  records  according  to  the  principles  and 
methodologies  recommended  by  BBS.  This  will  create  congenial  working  environment  for 
effective  use  of  administrative  data  for  decision  making.  It  will  also  help  in  meeting  evolving 
demand of statistics in different  Ministries/Departments in a cost  effective and timely manner,

ensure that all personnel working in the area of statistics are regularly trained and remain abreast 
with  the  latest  developments.  A  faculty  of  agriculture  statistics  will  be  needed  with  sufficient 
number of members.  They  will develop  course curriculum  for short and long term training on 
agriculture statistics. They will also involve in research activities with agriculture, fisheries and 
livestock  census  data  and  contribute  policy  planning  for  the  sector.  Reputed  national  and 
international experts can be invited for lecturing on agriculture statistics. 
The training Academy will be required to work in coordination with other related organization 
like  Agriculture  University,  ISRT  etc.  The  area  of  cooperation  will  be  in  designing  of  course 
curriculum, providing experts for training, establishing long term training courses etc. This can 
be done through signing MoU with these organizations.

Output 4.5 Agriculture Wing in BBS reorganized 
There is increasing activity in horticulture, livestock and fishery sector in the country. BBS in its 
agriculture  wing  is  not  in  a  position  to  adequately  focus  in  generation  of  statistics  in  these 
sectors. Statistics generated from the concerned Ministries is also at times not timely and not in 
accordance  with  fundamental  principles  of  official  statistics.  To  address  the  weakness 
effectively,  it  is  felt  that  the  present  agriculture  wing  may  be  divided  in  two  wings:  (i) 
Agriculture Statistics (Crops and Land use) Wing, and (ii) Agriculture Statistics (Fisheries, 
Livestock & Others) Wing. Agriculture Statistics (Crops and land use) Wing will handle only 
crops and land use statistics which will include crop production, horticulture and vegetable crops 
including  spices  etc.  Agriculture  Statistics  (Fisheries,  Livestock  and  Others)  Wing  will  handle 
statistics relating to livestock, fisheries, forestry and others.

Considering  the  necessity  of  strengthening  the  agriculture  price  information  system  is  very 
important  to  strengthen  Department  of  Agricultural  Marketing  (DAM)  to  improve  price  data 
collection System of Agricultural Produces. Existing staff in DAM is not adequate for collecting 
price  information  to  capture  price  volatility  at  Upazila  level.    Strengthening  is      required  for 
supporting and protecting farmers’ interest as well as sustainable agricultural development.  
Strategic actions/activities: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)  Conduct ad-hock survey by DAM for collecting price data 
Expand the organizational structure of Department of Agriculture Marketing (DAM) 
Improve data collection methodology by DAM with support of BBS 
Output 4.7 Remote Sensing Data Analysis Unit in Agriculture Wing of BBS created 
A unit of Spatial Data Analysis under proposed Agriculture Economics Statistics (Crops) Wing 
will  be  required  for  improvement  of  crop  area  and  land  use  statistics.  The  unit  will  also  use 
satellite data in conjunction with data on meteorology, soil condition, temperature etc. Adequate 
number of experts will be required for the purpose.

and land use) Wing 
(ii)  Generate RS based crop statistics 
4.5.5 Strategic Goal 5: Improve ICT infrastructure, develop ICT applications 
for  collection,  compilation  and  processing,  and  establish  Integrated  Data 
Management and dissemination system for ARS 
Conduct  of  surveys  on  agriculture  related  subjects  is  primary  activity  for  generation  of  ARS. 
Survey work is carried out by BBS and Agriculture related Ministries / Departments throughout 
the  year.  Availability  of  reliable  and  timely  data  is  possible  only  through  the  use  of  ICT. 
Therefore,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  required  infrastructure  in  BBS  and  other  data  collecting 
organization like DoF, DAM both in the field and headquarter. Personal Data Assistant / tablets/ 
laptops need be used for collection of data from the field. The data should be transferred from 
the  field  using  telecommunication  network  and  should  be  processed  and  compiled  at  the 
headquarter of these Ministries.  For BBS, agriculture data may be processed and compiled in 
agriculture wing with the help of ICT trained personnel. This will facilitate quick dissemination 
and timely use of data.  Using the ICT would result in minimization of cost and time, and also 
substantial reduction in non-sampling errors.  
 
Outputs under the goal: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)  Meta data on each AR statistics product available 
(iv)  Visibility of AR statistical product in public domain improved 
(v)

Statistical products generated using ICT tools 
Infrastructure for using GIS and Remote sensing techniques developed 
Data sharing protocols developed 
Integrated data dissemination platform established 
Output 5.1 Statistical products generated using ICT tools 
There  has  been  increasing  use  of  ICT  tools  in  collection,  compilation  processing  and 
dissemination of statistics. This capability should be further strengthened. There are number of 
ICT tools available for Data Collection. CAPI of the World Bank is one tool. There are many 
similar products available in the market. There is a need to assess this tool and suitably adopt in 
data  collection  process.  These  tools  may  also  be  required  to  be  customised  to  meet  the 
requirement of a particular survey. Internet based systems may have to be developed to transfer 
the data from the field to a server after due validation.   Such system will have to be introduced 
for each of the survey undertaken by BBS and the Ministries/ Department dealing in agriculture 
and rural statistics.  
Strategic action/activity: 
(i) 
Use of GIS/ Remote Sensing and other ICT applications for collection of agriculture 
related statistics 
30 
 
Output 5.2 Infrastructure for using GIS and Remote Sensing data developed 
GIS and Remote Sensing technology is currently used for generating land use information. It is 
commonly used for estimating crop area and for estimating crop yield even. The RS technology 
is useful for production forecasting and crop monitoring. In Bangladesh SPARSO is generating 
area  coverage  for  boro  and  aman  crop.  However,  the  information  for  other  crops  is  not 
available  due  to  pre-occupation  of  SPARSO  with  its  own  mandate.  Further  the  Geographic 
information need be further analysed with data from meteorology and related departments. It is 
therefore necessary that an inter-disciplinary crop forecasting mechanism is to be developed in 
coordination  of  agriculture  wing  of  BBS.  BBS  needs  a  set-up  of  RS  for  providing  crop 
coverage as this activity is prominent in agriculture statistics. 
Strategic actions/activities: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)  Develop integrated data management system 
Develop required infrastructure 
Human capacity building for use of GIS and Remote sensing 
Output 5.3 Meta data on each AR statistical product available

information  like  (i)  Data  Collecting  Agency,  (ii)  Data  Collecting  Frequency,  (iii)  Data 
Collection Methodology, (iv) Data Collection Staff, (v) Sample Size, (vi) Sample Selection (vii) 
Frame,  (viii)  Data  Collected,  (ix)  Data  Processing,  (x)  Data  Dissemination,  (xi)  Level  of 
disaggregation, (xii) Timeliness of data release, (xiii) Latest data available etc.  
Strategic action/activity: 
(i) 
Prepare of meta data of each AR statistical product 
Output 5.4 Visibility of AR statistical product in public domain improved 
A good coordinated system of data sharing and dissemination is proposed to be established so 
that the user can easily find the data in a same web-page getting the links of the relevant data. 
Strategic actions/activities: 
(i) 
Improve user participation in AR statistics usage, identification of new data needs 
and further action 
Organize Agriculture and Rural data user’s workshop 
Establish a modality to measure user satisfaction 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Output 5.5 Data sharing protocols developed 
The Bangladesh  Bureau  of Statistics will need to develop  data sharing protocols with  national 
and international agencies. This will create more visibility of data. The scope of deeper analysis 
and uses of data will be increased that will further improve planning process. 
31 
 
Strategic actions/activities: 
(i) 
(ii) 
Disseminate data in common management 
Prepare Rules and Regulations of data sharing 
Output 5.6 Integrated data dissemination platform established 
An integrated  approach  should be followed in  dissemination of agricultural  and rural  statistics 
where BBS and all the relevant Ministries/ Department would participate. This would require a 
coordinated  arrangement  on  behalf  of  the  Government  where  BBS  will  play  central  role.  A 
national Data Repository on ARS shall be established in BBS. ARS data would be accessible to 
the  users  and  stakeholders  through  the  website  of  BBS  which  will  provide  linkages  with  the 
websites  of  other  relevant  Ministries.  The  arrangement  of  such  sharing  will  be  developed  by 
signing of MOU between BBS and other Ministries. 
Strategic action/activity: 
        (i)       Create central data hub with BBS’s coordination 
 
Detailed Strategic goal-wise outputs, strategic actions/activities and objectively verifiable 
indicators are presented in the Logical Framework Document at Annex-IV.

CHAPTER V: IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING & EVALUATION, 
FINANCING AND ADVOCACY 
 
5.1 Implementation of SPARS 
5.1.1  Strategic  plan  on  ARS  is  a  document  for  future  activities  for  meeting  the  national  and 
international  demand  for  data  confirming  to  the  global  standard.  The  future  activities  must  be 
executed through institutional process and the institutional responsibilities shall be distributed to 
implement  the  projected  activities  in  a  timely  manner.  The  plan  will  help  to  implement  the 
programme effectively and efficiently. The activities and Objectively Verifiable Indicators have 
been listed in Logical Framework for each implementing institutions for achieving the strategic 
goals  of  SPARS.  The  ARS  will  meet  the  requirement  for  policy  makers,  development 
organizations  and  measure 
through 
implementation plan and appropriately execution of plan.      
indicators  of  specific  sectors 
the  performance 
5.1.2  SPARS  will  be  implemented  by  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  through  BBS  being  the 
focal  organization  and  all  the  agriculture  related  Ministries/  Departments.  Responsibility  for 
implementation  on  each  of  the  activities  identified  in  Logical  Framework  will  have  to  be 
assigned to each agency under the guidance of Coordination and Monitoring Committee. Apart 
from technical issues, this committee will also ensure that adequate resources, both financial and 
human, are provided for implementation. The Committee may setup sub-committees or technical 
working  groups  keeping  in  view  the  need  for  an  activity  and  kind  of  guidance  /  assistance 
required.  The Committee will review on the progress of work done and provide guidelines for 
implementation. 
5.2 Monitoring & Evaluation 
 
5.2.1 There should be a monitoring strategy for SPARS. It is expected that BBS as the custodian 
of SPARS should keep track of the implementation of SPARS activities with support from other 
line  ministries.  The  Objectively  Verifiable  Indicators  listed  in  the  Logical  Framework  for 
SPARS should be used for monitoring purposes.  Apart from half yearly review of the progress, 
Mid-term review of the progress may be done by the coordination and monitoring committee so 
that any course correction, if required, may be done.  
5.2.2 As the SPARS is designed to improve the agriculture and rural statistics, it will require to 
establish  the  follow-up  process  for  proper  implementation  of  SPARS.  For  this,  a  national 
committee  headed  by  Secretary,  Statistics  and  Informatics  Division  is  recommended  to  form 
where Director General, BBS may act as Co-chair of the committee. The committee will include 
the  main  stakeholders  of  agriculture  and  rural  statistics.  The  committee  will  evaluate  the 
progress  of  implementation  of  SPARS  for  monitoring  and  provide  guidelines  to  BBS  for 
achieving the SPARS goals. 
 
33 
 
5.3 Financing 
5.3.1 Immediate External Resource requirement 2017-2020 
At present the external resource requirement has been identified on two items: Agricultural 
Census and setting up of crop forecasting centre. Details are given below: 
1.  Agricultural Census 2018 
At this stage most important priority for the Government is to conduct an Integrated Agriculture 
(Crop, Livestock, Fishery and Forestry) Census planned for 2018. The project document is yet to 
be  approved  with  a  proposed  budget  BDT  34.50  million.  This  activity  is  the  basis  of 
establishment of Integrated National Survey Calendar based upon Sampling Frames. Keeping in 
view the technical support to other similar Censuses, it is expected that there will be a need for 
about USD 0.75 to 1 million. This assistance would be required on items like Census Planning 
(USD 150 thousand), Conduct of Census (USD 100 thousand), trainings and study tours (USD 
50  thousand),  IT  hardware  and  software  (USD  100  thousand),  tabulation  and  dissemination 
(USD  200  thousand),  Establishments  of  sampling  frames  (USD  100  thousand)  and  Data 
archiving, fine tuning survey calendar and preparing appropriate sampling designs etc. 
5.3.2 Financing through Five Year Plans 
The  main  thrust  of  BBS  work  in  the  next  three  years  will  be  conduct  of  Agricultural  Census 
which  is  a  major  national  undertaking.    A  clearer  picture  of  partnerships  and  Work  Plan  will 
emerge during/after the census, particularly on fish and livestock sub-sectors. 
The implementation of SPARS will be reviewed sometimes in 2019, and revised SPARS would 
have more precise work plan of activities. At that stage it will also be possible to estimate the 
resource  requirements  more  precisely  as  scope  of  many  statistical  activities  would  have  been 
clarified by that time. It is also expected that SPARS will be fully integrated in the Eighth Five 
Year  Plan.  The  planning  for  the  eighth  plan  (2021-25)  will  begin  in  2019.  Based  on  clearer 
picture at that time, line ministries may also propose for funding SPARS activities through their 
national budget. 
5.4 Advocacy 
4.1.1 It is expected that the SPARS document will be endorsed through due government process 
involving  all  the  stakeholders.  After  this  is  accepted  as  a  government  document,  consultative 
sessions will be organized with development partners to elicit their interest in supporting any of 
the identified activities.
