WITH THE GRACE OF THE ALMIGHTY GOD 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBUC OF INDONESIA, 
To stipulate: 
PRESIDENTIAL  REGULATION ON  NATIONAL  ENERGY 
POLICY. 
Considering: 
a,  that,  to ensure sufficiency of domestic energy sup- 
ply and to support sustainable development,  it is nec- 
essary to stipulate National Energy Policy as guide- 
lines for national energy management; 
CHAPTER I 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Article  l 
Hereinafter  referred t o  as: 
1,  Energy is power exploited to do various activities con- 
sisting of electricity, mechanics, and heat. 
b.  that,  based on the considerations as meant in para- 
graph a,  it is necessary to stipulate Presidential Regu- 
lation on National Energy Policy; 
2.  Source of Energy is part of natural resources, amongst 
others,  oil  and gas,  coal,  water,  geothermal,  peat 
moss,  biomass,  etc,  directly  or indirectly  exploited 
as energy. 
I n  view of: 
1.  Article 4 paragraph (1) of Constitution of 1945; 
3.  Certain  sources  of  alternative  energy  are  certain 
2.  Law No. 11/1967 on General Rules on Mining Affairs 
(Statute Book of  1967 No.  22,  Supplement t o  Stat- 
ute Book No.  2831); 
sources of energy as substitutes of oil fuel. 
4.  New Energy is energy produced by new technology, 
whether from renewable energy or unrenewable en- 
ergy,  amongst others,  hydrogen; coal bed methane, 
liquefied coal,  gasified coal,  and nuclear.

No. 74,  Supplement to Statute Book No.  3317); 
4.  Law No. 10/1997 on Nuclear Power (Statute Book of 
1997 No. 23,  Supplement to Statute Book No. 3676); 
5.  Renewable Energy is source of energy produced'from 
energy sources,  which  will  not naturally be used up 
and sustainable if managed properly, amongst others, 
geothermal,  biofuel,  river flow,  solar heat,  wind,  bio- 
mass,  biogas, sea waves, and sea-depth temperature,

2001 No. 136, Supplement to Statute Book No. 41 52) 
as already amended by Decision of the Constitutional 
Council  No. 002/PUU-1/2003  dated  December 21, 
2004 (State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia No. 
1/2005); 
6 ,   Energy Diversification is diversification of supply and 
exploitation of various sources of energy in the frame- 
work of energy supply optimization. 
7.  Energy Conversion is exploitation of energy efficiently 
and  rationally without  reducing  exploitation  of im- 
portant energy,  which is really needed.
