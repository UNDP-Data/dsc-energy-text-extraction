1  ExecutiveSummary
The  Administration  of  the  State  Historical-Architectural  Reserve  “Icherisheher”  has  committed  itself  to
reduce  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  up  to  20%  from  2011up  to  the  year  2020  in  its  fields  of  activity
within  the  Administration’s  sphere  of  authority.  2011  was  chosen  as  the  baseline  year,  due  to  the
availability of reliable data. The achieved reduction in emissions will be a result of both long-term energy-
saving work and attitude changes of the local public.
The  Administration  of  the  State  Historical-Architectural  Reserve  “Icherisheher”  is  able  to  control  and
reduce  the  carbon  dioxide  emissions  caused  by  its  own  energy  use,  but  it  is  also  partialy  possible  to
influence  emissions  caused  by  energy  use  in  other  sectors,  through  tools  such  as  building  retrofitting,
increasing  the  awareness  and  the  provision  of  energy  conservation  campaigns, and  more  generally  by
acting  as  a  good  example and  spreading  information  of  the  best  practices. Approximately  36  %  of  the
emissions in the Reserve “Icherisheher” are estimated to be within the power sector of the city. Over 70
percent of electricity consumption is accounted for public lighting and municipality buildings. Hence, major
focus of the action plan is on the electricity sector. The actions presented under Scopes 6 are the sources
of emissions which Old City of Baku (Icherisheher) has a jurisdiction for intervention. Sustainable Energy
Action  Plan  envisages  programmed  actions  which  are  designed  to  reduce  CO2  emissions  within  the
boundaries of the Old City.

Introduction
2.1  CountryBackground
The economic development of the country in the last decade was strong with an averagegrowth rate of
GDP of around 10% for the period 2000–2005; in 2005–2007 it increased almostthreefold, reaching 28%
on  average  and falling  down  to  10%  in  2008–2009  annually.  Oil andgas development  and  export have
been  central  matter  for  Azerbaijan’s  economic  growth.  The  volumeof  production  has  increased  due  to
visible progress in almost all the fields of  industry as well as inoil and gas, chemistry and oil chemistry,
machinery, metal processing, building materials andindustry.

At present, Azerbaijan provides 100% of its gross energy consumption through domesticproduction, which
is currently largely reliant on the exploitation of the country’s hydrocarbonreserves, namely oil and natural
gas.  Azerbaijan  is,  at  the  present  time,  a  net  exporter  of  oiland  natural  gas.  There  are  a  number  of
perspective fieldsin Azerbaijan that are under development and it is expected that new exploration fields
willpositively contribute to an increase in the country’s oilproduction.
Securing long-term energy independence is a stated policy goal for fostering economicgrowth. However,
as  the  country  is  already  energy  independent  and  is  a  net  energy  exporter,the  momentum  towards
harnessing a renewable energy sources (RES) potential appears to belinked to recent high international
oil and gas prices.
The  Azerbaijani  Government  has  adopted  the  State  Programme  for  the  Development  of  theFuel  and
Energy  Sector  (2005–2015),  which  identifies  and  sets  development  targets  for  thevarious  sub-sectors
within  the  energy  sector  along  with  a  package  of  specifically  definedmeasures  aimed  at  achieving
theabovementioned targets and goals within the prescribedperiod over the next 10 years. The overall goal
of the state programme is to meet the electricpower, gas and other energy demands of both thepopulation
and  economy  fully  throughthe  continued  development  of  the  fuel  and  energy  sector.  There  is  limited
competition due toexisting monopolies in the gas and electricity sectors.
Azerbaijan  joined  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)in  the
category of  a non-Annex  I country  in 1995, and  is  also a signatory  to other  internationalagreements  on
climate change, such as the Kyoto Protocol. Its Climate Change Programme(CCP) focuses on three main
areas: the greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory, vulnerability andadaptation and GHG mitigation and carbon
financing.  The  second  national  communicationon  climate  changes  was  submitted  to  the  UNFCCC  in
2010.
The renewable energy resources will help  Azerbaijan to reach to the next stage in its future development.
Azerbaijan is known as a rich country which possesses renewable and alternative energy potential and
intends  to  increase  the  share  of  renewable  and  alternative  energy  resources  in  the  total  energy
production up to 20 percent until 2020.  Moreover, Azerbaijan possesses very fruitful natural conditions
for  elaborating  renewable  energy  resources.    At  the  outset,  Absheron  peninsula  has  got  enormous
potential for wind power energy. The speed of the wind is ranging between 3 - 7 m/sec along a year which
isconsideredas very good circumstance for the wind power generators.

The  Order  of  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  dated  01.02.2013  on  Improvement  of
Management  System  in  the  field  of  Alternative  and  Renewable  Energy  in  the  country  resulted  in
establishment  of  State  Agency  on  Alternative  and  Renewable  Energy  Resources  of  the  Republic  of
Azerbaijan.
The Agency is a central executive body whichdeals with management and arrangement of the state policy
on  Alternative  and  Renewable  Energy  and  its  efficient  comsumption,  effective  management  and
coordination  of  theactivities  on  Alternative  and  Renewable  Energy  Resources  and  implementation  of
State supervision on these activities within the Republic of Azerbaijan.
The  Agency  takes  part  in  formation  of  unique  state  policy  on  the  related  field  and  guarantees  the
realization  of  this  policy,enables  the  development  of  Alternative  and  Renewable  Energy  field  and
establishment of its infrastructure, and ensures the application of alternative and renewable energy in the
economy and social field.
2.2  The OldCityof Baku
6
The  Old  City  of  Baku  or  Inner  City  (Icherisheher)  is  the  historical  centre  of  Baku.  This  small  town  has
managed  to  preserve  its  ancient  architectural  and  cultural  heritage  throughout  the  centuries.  The  Old
Cityhas  managed  to  preserve  its  ancient  architectural  and  cultural  heritage  throughout  the  centuries.  It
has been classified in 2000 as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
Nowadays  historical  center  of  Baku  –  Icherisheher  is  under  State’s  Protection.  The  area  of  the  State
Historical-Architectural  Reserve  “Icherisheher”  is  22  hectares  and  encompasses  about  500  historical
monuments.  There  are  4300  residents  living  in  Icherisheher,  several  museums,  theatres,  hotels,
handicraft shops and restaurants at the disposal of residents and visitors, turns this ancient city into oneof
the most attractive destinations for tourist visiting Azerbaijan.
2.3 LegislativeandInstitutionalFramework
Among the three main priorities of Azerbaijan’s environmental policies set by the Ministry of Ecology and
Natural  Resources  (MENR),  one  is  the  ‘Efficient  Use  of  Natural  Resources  for  Meeting  the  Needs  of
Existing  and  Future  Generations,  Benefiting  from  Renewable  Energy  Sources  through  Non-traditional
Methods  and  Achieving  Energy  Efficiency’.  The  Azerbaijani  Government  puts  special  emphasis  on  EE
and relevant targets are set through various state programs.
‘The National Program on Environmentally Sustainable Social and Economic Development for the period
2003–2010 recognizes the rationalization of the use of non-renewable sources of energy as an important
factor  in the  implementation of environmental and  sustainable development. The program  proposes  the
following actions in relation to this purpose:
(cid:127) introducing highly efficient technologies in heat power plants and optimizing the structure of the energy
system;
(cid:127) promoting modern energy saving technologies in both production and non-production
sectors; and
(cid:127) developing and implementing national and regional programs aimed at better use of
energy saving means in households.
The  State  Programme  for  the  Development  of  the  Fuel  and  Energy  Sector  (2005–2015)  targets  the
reduction of losses and prevention of the theft and inefficient use of energy in order to cover the electric
power and  natural  gas  demands.  It  is  stated  that full payment  of  the  cost  of  electricity  and  natural  gas
7
consumed is one of the factors that would ensure efficient use of these resources. The State Program on
the  Use  of  Alternative  and  Renewable  Sources  (approved  in  2004)  also  envisages  more  efficient
utilization of hydrocarbon energy sources as one of the objectives.
Although the government sets the targets for an energy efficient economy, there is no law nor secondary
legislation specific to EE activities. The basic elements for the promotion of EE are captured in the Law on
the Use of Energy Resources, which took effect in 1996.
3  Governance
In order the long-term protection, conservation and continuation of restoration of Icherisheher, as well as
the  intensification  and  increasing  systemization  of  this  work  has  established  a  state  agency  -
Administration of the State Historical-Architectural Reserve “Icherisheher” under the Cabinet of Ministers
of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  by  the  decree  of  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  dated  10
February 2005. Administration combines the function of a local executive power (municipal authority) and
central  executive  power  agency.  Today  the  Administration  is  fully  staffed  and  functional,  and  has  8
entities within its structure that enable it to fulfill its mandate.
Administration  has  full  authority  in  the  area  in  all  the  matters  relating  to  the  city  management,
infrastructure,  protection  of  monuments,  research  and  protection  of 
the  cultural  heritage  etc.
Administration is directly reporting to the Cabinet of  Ministers and its Director is being appointed by the
President  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan.  The  entire  heritage  area  has  been  declared  a  preserve  in  the
domestic legislation.
In  2009  Protection  Buffer  Zone  of  the  State  Historical-Architectural  Reserve  “Icherisheher”  has  been
identified and approved by the Decision of Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
During  the  last  7  years  the  Administration  has  developed  number  of  strategic  documents  aimed  at
conservation  and  development  of  the  city.  These  include  –  Conservation  Master  Plan,  Integrated  Area
Management Action Plan, and most recently Integrated High Level Economic Development strategy and
action  plan.  Various  international  experts,  architects  and  management  consulting  companies  were
engaged for the development of these documents.
Conservation Master Plan(CMP) was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan
in November 2010.

The  Charter of  the  Administration  of  the  State  Historical-Architectural  Reserve  “Icherisheher” under the
Cabinet  of  Ministers  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  was  approved  by  a  Decree  of  the  President  of  the
Republic of  Azerbaijan  on May  16, 2007, and  the  Administration  has been  operating  since  that time. In
order  to  fulfill  its  duties,  the  Administration  has  the  authority  to:  prepare  regulatory  and  legal  acts
concerning  to  the  reservedarea  or participate  in  the  preparation  of  such acts; ban  the  execution  of  any
renovation,  rehabilitation,  reconstruction,  regeneration  and  construction  repair  works  not  authorized  by
the  Administration;  issue  mandatory  instructions;  stop  transfer  for  use,  including  the  leasing  of
monuments  under  state  (municipal)  ownership  where  such  transfer  has  not  been  approved  by  the
Administration; suspend archeological and excavation works in the Reserve area; set up structures and
facilities  providing  services  on  a  temporary  and  permanent  basis  and  generate  income  from  their
operation in compliance with legislation, etc.
Charter on the Special Legal Regime Regulation of Buffer Zone of Icherisheherhas been approved by the
Cabinet  of  Ministers  (September,  2011).  It  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  proposals  of
relevant  state  authorities  (namely,  State  Committee  of  Urban  Planning  and  Architecture,  Ministry  of
Justice,  National  Academy  of  Sciences  and  the  Executive  Power  of  Baku).  The  document  stipulates
special  legal  regime  for  buffer  zone  where  all  kind  of  activities  that  may  endanger  the  historical
monuments are prohibited.
 In order to study scientific-technical achievements and advanced experiences related to the Reserve the
Scientific and  Technical  Council  under  the State Historical-Architectural  Reserve “Icherisheher”  is being
created.
Significant conservation and restoration works affecting public areas and facades of the public buildings
and  squares  has  been  carried  out.  A  Number  of  objects  of  tourist  infrastructure  were  developed  and
procured in order to respond to the growing number of visitors to the Old City. Fully computerized system
of traffic management has been developed and operated with the purpose to limit the maximum number
of cars that can access Old City at any given time.
3.1  Socio-economicalcharacteristics
There are 4300 inhabitants of the Icherisheher. Meanwhile, 22 percent of the inhabitants are the youth.
The  residential  density  of  the  people  is  19460  capita  per  km².  There  are  1023  apartments  in  424
residential  buildings  in  the  area  of  Icherisheher.  These  buildings  are  classified  as  per  their  stroys  as
follows:
-  One – stroyed   building -   37 pieces
9
-  Two – stroyed   building   - 286 pieces
-  Three – stroyed building - 87 pieces
-  Four – stroyed building   - 9   pieces
-  Five – stroyed building -   2 pieces
-  Seven – stroyed building   - 3 pieces
Besides  the  residential  buildings,  there  are  39  administrative  buildings  (9  museums,  6  diplomatic
missions,    9  state agencies,  10  mosques,  2  public unions,  1  kindergarden and  1  fine  arts  school),  341
commercial  enterprises  (28  hotels, 24  service enterprises,  26  catering  establishments,  15  groceries, 87
non-food product stores,  4 banks, 141 offices, 11 exhibition halls, 5 workshops).
The  new  vacant  places  are  created  for  ensuring  the  employment  of  inhabitants  of  the  Icherisheher.
These  vacant  places are  mainly  covers  tourism sector and  craftsmanship.  In  order  to  pave  the  way  of
development of traditional mastership and create mastership blocks the rehabilitation of the houses had
been implemented. Administration of the State Historical-Architectural Reserve “Icherisher” along with the
UK  based  Prince’s  School  of  Traditional  Arts  established  “Icherisheher  Centre  for  Traditional  Arts”  for
reviving the decorative applied fine arts  types which are threatened to disappear.
Meanwhile,  there  are  a  lot  of  work  done  to  improve  the  services on  public  utilities.    In  the  first time  in
Azerbaijan the selective transportation of household waste had been applied in the Inner City.  In order to
ensure the quick response on applications of inhabitants of the “Icherisher” State Historical-Architectural
Reserve and improve the rendered service quality, the new online application system has been created in
the Housing Maintanance Service .
The special measures are carried out for reducing the engagement problems amongst the inhabitants of
Inner City.
 In order to ensure the comforts and health of the inhabitants, the special medical point was opened.
The  Council of  Elders  consisting  of  persons  highly  respected  by  the  inhabitants, has  been  established
and  provided  with  special  office  for  paving  the  Council  to  organize  its  duties  accordingly  in  order  to
increase the role of inhabitanats in decision-making processes, to get benefit from the experience of local
inhabitants  on  construction,  maintanace  and  rehabilitation  running  in  the  area  of  “Icherisher”  State
Historical-Architectural Reserve.

4  Objective (s) andTargets
Energy analysis and current energy consumption trends demonstrate that the energy demand and
electricity has been growing in the last decade at around 2,78% per year.
The objective of reducing 20% the greenhouse emissions by 2020 to compare to the baseline year 2011
in global terms. This is the main aim of the SEAP: to overcome the increasing energy demand tendency
and invert it to reach 20% reduction of the green house gas emissions with respect to the baseline year
2011.
The total emissionof CO2 in 2011(baseline) was 2794.1 MtCO2, so 20% off that value means a reduction
of    558.8 MtCO2 by the year2020. Based on this calculation the overall objective of the SEAP is to
reduce a total of 558.8 t CO2from the baseline levels by 2020.
5  Current framework and vision for the future
The replacement of electric energy by other sources, particularly renewable energy sources, could lead to
a considerable reduction in emissions.
The  potential  sources  of  GHG  (Green  House  Gas)  in  the  oil  and  gas  sector  in  Azerbaijan  are  Azneft
Production  Unity,  the  HeydarAliyev  Oil  Refinery  in  Baku  and  the AzerneftYag  Oil  and  Gas  Refinery,  all
belonging to the state oil company (SOCAR). Every year, 3 million tons of GHG in CO 2 eq. are emitted by
SOCAR,  by  operating  companies  and  joint  ventures  in  Azerbaijan.  1.3  million  tons  ffthis  amount  are
associated  gas.  Starting from the  end  of  2009,  as  a  result  of  actions by SOCAR,  600  thousand  tons of
emissions  were  utilized.  During  oil  extraction  about  500  thousand  tons  in  CO 2  eq.  of  associated  gas  is
released to atmosphere per year, but by taking appropriate actions the GHG emission that result from the
release  of  associated  gas  can  be  reduced  by  1.2  million  tons  (Second  National  Communication  to  the
UNFCCC,  MENR,  2010).  SOCAR  has  been  taking  regular  actions  to  deal  with  climate  change.  It  has
established  the  Ecological  Park  in  order  to  meet  the  demand  for  trees  and  shrubs,  and  to  inform  the
population  about  environmental  issues.  In  order  to  meet  part  of  the  peak  demand  for  electricity  from
alternative energy sources and RES, four wind generators with 10 kW each and solar panels with a total
capacity of 20 kW have been installed as a pilot project.
11
With the purpose of implementing the utilization of low-pressure associated gases at the Oil Rocks project
within  the  CDM,  a  project  documentation  developed  jointly  with  the  Gazprom  Germany  Consulting
Company has been filed with the Executive Council of the Kyoto Protocol on CDM for registration, and is
now in the process of verification. After the completion of technical and installation works, 200 million m3
of associated gases will be prevented from being emitted into the atmosphere.
The plan to reduce the amount of  associated gases emitted by SOCAR and by the projects of  SOCAR
has been developed by SOCAR jointly with the Partnership for Reduction of Global Gas Burning initiative
of the World Bank.
According to the status of  the Administration of  theState  Historical-Architectural  Reserve  “Icherisheher”,
area as “historical and architectural reserve”, all kinds of industry are prohibited in this area, except small
entrepreneurship  such  as  cafes,  tea  houses,  shops  which  mainly  sell  historical  and  cultural  handicraft
illustrate Azerbaijani history, culture and local traditions.
The main sources of greenhouse emissions in this area are transport, electricity and gas supply. There is
no  centralized  heating  system  functioning  at  the  area  of  State  Historical-Architectural  Reserve
“Icherisheher” and residents and organizations having offices here use energy and gas to warm buildings
in a cold season.
6  Baseline Emission Inventory
Baseline emissions were calculated by defining following categories:
Category 1
Municipality Buildings Natural Gas Consumption
Residential Buildings Natural Gas Consumption
Tertiary Building
Category 2
12
Municipality Buildings Electricity Consumption
Public street lighting
Residential Electricity Consumption
Category 3
Municipality Employee’s Service Transportation Fuel Consumptions
Private and Commercial Transport
Emission reduction targets of municipality of the Old City towards 2020 are set by considering following:
ü 
In order to calculate the reliable carbon emission inventory of the district the year 2011 is chosen
as a base year.
ü  Data are taken from several sources. For the building sector the data has been gathered from
Municipality own database.
ü  Electricity consumption rates of the region has been given by the local stakeholder
BAKIELEKTRIKSHEBEKE (the entity which distributes electricity in Baku region)
ü  Natural gas consumption which is used in many areas for heating, cooking and etc. for the year
2011 has been taken from AZERIGAZ national gas distributor.
ü  Tertiary buildings contain hotels, museums, office buildings etc.
ü  For the fuel consumption of fleet of the municipality data has been taken from its own database.
ü  Public lightings are also under jurisdiction of the Administration, so it has been shown in the
report and was included to the action plan.
Total  baseline  emissions  calculated  was  2794.1  T/CO2.  The  largest  share  of  emissions  belongs  to
Buildings and Facilities with 1001 T/CO2. Emission levels for each sector provided in Figure 6.1 and 6.2
below.

14
Note. Emissions form Transport Sector is only 0.02% of total, hence, neglected in the chart.
Private industry is not included in the objective of reduction of CO 2 emissions and therefore no any
measures are planned for this sector.
6.1  Naturalgas
Gasification  of  Icherisheher  started  in1950.  “AzeriGaz”  –national  gas  utility  company  is  the  supplier  of
natural  gas.  The  gas  distributionnetwork  are  regularly  maintained,  and  checked  by  relevant  branch  of
“AzeriGaz”. Total length of gas pipeline network is 9038 m of which 60 % laid underground.
There  are  no  leakages  in  gas  distribution  network  reported  in  last  ten  years.  The  gas  consumption
tendency in State Historical-Architectural Reserve “Icherisheher” is given in Table 1.

6.2  Buildingandfacilities
At least 70% of the energy is used for warming (water warming and heating) and cooling, that means that
introduction of different applications of renewable energy sources and using more environmentally friendly
technologies  is  very  important  condition  to  save  the  current  spending.    And,  of  course,  it  reduces  the
impact  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  that  the  State  Historical-Architectural  Reserve  “Icherisheher”
exposes to the environment.
Total area of administrative buildings is 6780,53 m2 and it was the largest single source of CO2 emissions
(1000 tons) in baseline year (2011).
6.3  Transportation
During  past  years,  traffic  had  become  a  threat  to  the  UNESCO-listed  World  Heritage  Sites:  Cars  and
trucks damaged the narrow streets of an area that was not designed for motorized traffic. Exhaust fumes
both  degraded  the  air  quality  of  the  district  and  threatened  the  historical  buildings,  damaging  their
surfaces.  Moreover,  vibrations  caused  by  traffic  harmed  their  structures.  To  counter  these  negative
impacts, the district Reserve launched a project in 2007 that aimed at finding a solution to the damages
caused by road traffic in IcheriSheher. In September 2009, an automated traffic control system was set up
to strictly monitor vehicles going in and out of the district. The entrance into Icherisheher is regulated and
limited  by  two  gates on  paid  basis, except for  residents of  the  city and  representatives of  organizations
and firms having office space inside of the Icherisheher.
16
During the  summer  before  the  measure  was  put  in  place,  the  authorities progressively  restricted  traffic
and  at  the  same  time  informed  both  car  drivers  and  residents  about  the  new  traffic  regulation  to  be
implemented.  The  system  enables  the  identification  of  vehicles,  records  the  vehicles  entrance  tothe
district and gives access (or not) to the vehicles, depending on the number of vehicles already present in
the  old  town.  The  goal  is  to  be  able  to  manage  the  volume  of  vehicles  inside  the  district  to  protect
monuments and historic buildings, to development tourism, and to enable the safe and easy movements
of  pedestrians within  the  area. Supplementing  the  introduction  of  the  access restriction, all roads in  the
historic center were transformed into one-way roads.
Access to the district is controlled with electronic cards. There are two access gates, and the system is
able to record any car no matter which gate it uses to enter or exit. Only car drivers who live or work in the
historical center have free access, as do public service vehicles.
Magnetic access cards are issued to the following categories of vehicle users:
·  Ambulances, fire, police and emergency services enter for free, without cards, without tickets
·  People living in the district get two free cards for private cars
17
·    Food delivery vehicles get one free card
·  Public institution vehicles get two free cards
·  Cars used by museums and exhibition centers are provided with one free card
·  Cars used by local businesses and facilities have to pay to subscribe to a card
The  drivers  of  all  other  vehicles  intending  to  enter  the  district  have  to  buy  an  e-card  before.  They  can
access the district on the condition that the maximum number of vehicles driving in Icherisheher has not
been reached already. The cost of the e-card varies depending on the amount of time spent on site, with
a minimum of one hour. The funds raised from the toll are dedicated to staff housing, communal services
and to the administration of the district. They are also used to finance the transportation system and pay
the staff responsible for managing the system.
As an additional feature, the software used to run the system allows adjusting the maximum number of
vehicles present in the historical district. As of today, it is kept at 450 vehicles. When this limit is reached,
only people with permanent access cards can enter the district. In this case, information is displayed on
the  monitors  at  the  entrance  gate  to  inform  visitors  that access is temporarily  suspended for cars.  The
implementation of this system led to a six-to-seven fold reduction in the number of vehicles entering the
district.
The  Administration  of  the  State  Historical-Architectural  Reserve  “Icherisheher”continues  to  study  and
learn from experiences in foreign countries to improve the system. Generally, the number of cars on the
roads in Baku has increased during the last decade, and exhaust fumes obviously have a negative impact
on  the  environment,  particularly  on  the  historical  buildings  of  "Icherisheher".  For  the  convenience  of
visitors  and  residents  in  the  old  town,  local  authorities  are  currently  also  evaluating  the  option  of
introducing electric cars.
The Administration of the State Historical-Architectural Reserve “Icherisheher” was the first in Azerbaijan
among  municipalities  starting  using  electro  cars  to  reduce greenhouses emissions  and  promote  energy
efficiency.    10  electro  cars  are  owned  by  municipality  which  mostly  used  for  transportation  of  tourists

The state of technological infrastructure of “Icherisheher” Administration is presented in Annex1.
6.5  Heatingsystem
There is no heating system exist in “Icherisheher” area and all buildings are heating by electricity of gas
during cold season.
7  Planned Actions and Measures for the Duration of Plan
7.1  LongTermAction
Planned actions and measures for the full duration of the plan until 2020.
7.1.1  Construction of new gas distribution networks
It is recommended to develop a hydraulic scheme of theIcherisheher gas supply, taking into consideration
the  workload  of  new  consumers.  This  would  enable  reliable  supply  of  gas  to  consumers  over  the  long
term.
7.1.2  Promotion of energy efficient products and services
Following three actions will be undertaken by Old City administration to support energy efficient product
and services:
23
·  The  Administration  of  Icherisheher  will  introduce  requirements  of  energy  efficiency  criteria  in
tender conditions for all services and infrastructures in municipality area.
·  The Administration will promote annual city competitions to identify business and institutions that
have achieved highest performance indicators of social and economic development.
·  The  Administration  will  award  green  prize  to  any  manufacturer,  business  for  installation  of
renewable energy facility and use less traditional sources of energy.
The  Administration  of  “Icherisheher”  plans  to  save  100,000  Kwh  of  energy  through  above  mentioned
measures. This is equivalent of 89 tons of CO2.
7.2  ShortTermAction
Administration of “Icherishsher” will take short-term actions with quick impacts on the reduction of
emissions given below:
7.2.1  LED bulbs for Outdoor lighting
Outdoor  lighting  account  for  7  %  of  total  emissions  with  its  lion  share  in  electricity  consumption.  The
Administration  of  Old  City  plans  to  replace  all  outdoor  lighting  bulbs  with  more  efficient  LED  bulbs.
24
Assessment  undertaken  by  the  Administration  proved  that  this  would  enable  to  save  approximately
303,900kwhper year.
LED bulbs are proven to have up to 30,000 hrs of lifespan and are the most efficient technology available
in  the  market.    All-LED  based  outdoor  lighting  will  consume  only  170,000  KW  hrs  of  electricity  versus
473,900 Kwh consumed in base year. The detailed description of  proposed bulbs for outdoor lighting is
provided in Annex 3.
Public street lighting (PSL) comprises of two parts: 1) Street lighting and 2) facade lighting for buildings.
Total electricity consumption by PSL facilities in base year (2011) was 473900 Kw hours. Outdoor lights
operate for 13 hours daily providing lighting for public.
Assessment undertaken by the Municipality proved that this measure would enable to save approximately
303,900  kwh  per  year  which  is equivalent of 271  tons  of  CO2  per  year  which  accounts for  48% of  the
target.
7.2.2  Sensorsinbuildings
People  do  not  occupy  spaces  for a  large percentage  of  time, and  are  not  diligent  about  controlling  the
lighting  in  their  spaces  both  during  the  workday,  and  after  hours  and  weekends.  This  applies  to  both
public spaces as well as personal spaces. The majority of this energy waste occurs during the weekdays,
not  during  the  weeknights  or  over  the  weekends.  This  pattern  of  energy  waste  is  particularly  suited  to
control by occupancy sensors, which not only prevent runaway operation after typical business hours, but
also capture savings during the business day.
Although the majority of observed savings opportunities occurred during the weekday, the peak savings
contributions  from  occupancy  sensors  for  several  space  types  did  not  fall  within the  typical  peak  utility
billing  periods  (early  afternoon)  or peak  commercial  building  demand  periods  (10  a.m.  to  4  p.m.).  This
suggests that while sensors may help to save expensive kilowatt-hours, they would have a variable effect
at reducing a building’s peak demand, given their variable performance in when they provide high levels
of  savings  among  the  various  space  types.  This  would  be  a  useful  topic of  additional  research,  where
assigning specific kilowatt-hour rates to each kilowatt-hour saved would yield more accurate indication of
the economic benefits of installing sensors within these various space types.
Finally,  modeling  control  scenarios  with  5-  to 20-minute  time  delay  periods indicated  savings  potentials
that were within the ranges suggested by the industry estimates. The time delay settings used for these
25
analyses showed that energy savings can range from between 6% and 13% depending on the application
and  on  which  time  out  setting  is  used.  In  addition,  the  highest  savings  were  obtained  in  the  restroom
application (47% to 60%), and the lowest in the break rooms (17% to 29%). Thus, the time delay selection
can  greatly  impact  energy  savings.  Although  these  savings  are  significant  they  do  not  consider  the
increased  maintenance  lamp  and  labor  replacement  costs that  could  result  due  to  more  frequent  lamp
switching.Approx. 80 sensors can be installed which would enable to save 100,000 Kwh per year which
will enable to save 89 ton of CO2 per year.
7.2.3  TransportSystem
Among  energy  saving  actions  in  transportation  sector  of  Icherisheher  could  be  further  limitation  in  a
number of cars allowed to entrance to the city.
26
Besides, Administration of “Icherishsher” consider different options for placement of environmental check
point  services    at  entrances  to  the  Municipality  to  control  greenhouses  emissions  exhausted  by  cars
engine before they will enter to the city. In case emissions from the car will exceed standards the owner of
the car will be informed and driving of the car in Reserve area will be banned.
Among  other  possible  measures  resulting  from  this  investigation  it  might  be  creation  of  new park&ride
systems, promoting using of environmentally sound transportation and development of bicycle system.
Nowadays, any city cannot be sustainable in terms of mobility if does not create favorable conditions for
the  bicycle as  the  cleanest and  healthiest  mean  of  transport.  Modern  cities  are  replacing  their  cars  for
bikes and closing the city centers to the cars.
The  Administration  of  “Icherisheher”  plans  to  provide  series  of  informative  campaigns  for  promotion  of
usage of bicycle in Icherisheher with involvement of professional sportsmen’s and to design locations for
bicycles also, especially in locations where intensive traffic is observed.
All measures listed above will result in reduction of 0.2 tons of CO2.
27
7.2.4  Residentialbuildings
The total area of residential buildings is 45000 m 2 which mostly consist of the old buildings with more than
100-150 years of history.
Administration  of  “Icherisheher”  carries  out  all  necessary  maintenance  activities  during  year  based  on
local residents requests. 150-180 houses maintained annually and most works are related with renovation
of the roofs, renovation of window, different kinds of lagging activities.
Renovating  of  windowscarried out by  the  Administration  of  “Icherishsher”  upon  request of  residents.  All
windows  are  made  of  wood  and  in  order  to  maintain  the  cultural  value  of  the  buildings,  hence  only
wooden windows are installed. Nevertheless, insulation measures such as filling the gaps in windows by
insulation  materials  shall  bring  energy  saving  and  CO2  emission  reductions.  It  is  planned  to  apply  this
measure to 50 houses, area of  repaired windows estimated at 170 m 2.With this measure the estimated
saved energy is 14 MWh/year and the estimated reduction of CO 2 is 13.5 tCO2.
28
Renovation of roofs
Ceiling  and  roofs  are  accounted  generally  for  20%  of  energy  loss  in  buildings.  Administration  of
“Icherishsher”  plans  to  renovate  3343  m2.of  roofing  during  SEAP  implementation  period.  Majority  of
residential  buildings  have  flat  roofs  and  renovation  works  include  sealing  the  roof  with  insulation
materials. It is estimated that this measure will enable to achieve 5 MWh saving per annum on electricity
and respectively 4.48 tCO2.
7.3  Public activities with citizens and stakeholders
7.3.1 Publicawarenessprograms
Administration  of  “Icherisheher”  carries  out  intensive  public  campaign  to  promote  renewable  energy
sources, energy saving technologies and energy efficiency actions, especially among children and youth
at least four times in a year.
During of the public campaign in reserve area the lecturers, art completions and song contest organized
by the Administration to promote sustainable energy development, 20% emissions reduction commitment
for citizens.
29
7.3.2  Bicycleculturepropagandaactions
30
