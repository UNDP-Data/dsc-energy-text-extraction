EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Rapidly rising energy demand and reliance on fossil fuels
India’s energy needs are rising fast, with growth in electricity demand and other energy uses among 
the highest in the world. In one direction lies a future heavily reliant on fossil fuels; and in the other, a more 
diverse energy mix based on greater use of renewables� If India follows the first route, it risks locking its 
energy system into today’s pattern – with increasing levels of air pollution, uncertainties around meeting its 
sustainability targets and concerns about supply and sourcing for coal, oil and natural gas� The government, 
contemplating  a  better  path,  has  taken  steps  to  increase  renewables  and  move  the  country  towards  a 
sustainable future� Still, much remains to be done� This report provides a perspective on the changes required 
for India to achieve an affordable, secure, inclusive and environmentally friendly energy system�
India’s  socio-economic  characteristics  make  it  unique  among  the  world’s  major  energy-consuming 
economies. Per capita income is low, but is expected to grow quickly as India becomes the world’s most 
populous  country  towards  the  end  of  this  decade�  Population  and  economic  growth,  combined  with 
accelerating urbanisation, will increase the number of people living in cities and towns from approximately 
435 million in 2015 to 600 million by 2030� Urban populations consume more energy and – importantly in 
India’s case – significantly more electricity�
India’s total demand for energy will more than double by 2030, while electricity demand will almost 
triple. Ensuring that India’s growing population has access to energy, and meeting the country’s ambitious 
economic growth targets, will require massive investments in the power, transport, buildings and industry

sectors� Despite rapidly growing demand and significant renewable energy potential, India is set to install less 
renewable power-generation capacity than China, Germany or the United States� India’s electricity demand 
has grown by 10% a year over the past decade� Rapid growth is expected to continue, requiring massive 
investments in power-generation capacity and related infrastructure� This creates an important opportunity 
for renewable energy deployment, assuming the right policies are in place and policy makers start planning 
for it now�
Despite rapid strides in adding power capacity, India continues to be plagued by widespread energy 
poverty.  Much  of  the  population  lacks  access  to  clean  and  affordable  energy�  Estimates  suggest  that 
80  million  households,  or  more  than  300  million  people,  have  limited  or  no  access  to  electricity�  While 
the  electricity  grid  now  covers  much  of  the  country,  reaching  rural  or  remote  areas  with  the  necessary 
transmission and distribution infrastructure often remains a challenge� Supply constraints, therefore, persist�
In economic terms, the health impact of outdoor air pollution costs about 3% of India’s annual gross 
domestic product, and indoor air pollution adds significantly to this total. The World Health Organization 
estimates  that  the  number  of  deaths  from  ambient  air  pollution  reached  700 000  in  2010�  Besides,  400 
million Indians (90% of them women) are exposed to respiratory, pulmonary and vision hazards associated 
with indoor air pollution from burning traditional biofuels� Both outdoor and indoor air pollution must be 
addressed through clean and sustainable rural and urban energy supplies�
If business continues as usual and present energy and environmental policies persist, fossil fuels will still 
dominate India’s total energy mix in 2030 and beyond. Such a pathway, known as the Reference Case in 
this report, relies heavily on fossil fuels along with unsustainable and inefficient uses of bioenergy to meet 
most of the country’s rising energy demand� While the growth of renewable power generation will accelerate, 
even faster increases are expected in the use of coal for industry, natural gas in residential and commercial 
buildings, and oil in transport� India’s demand for coal is set to triple by 2030� As a result, the share of modern 
renewables could decrease from around 17% to only 12% of India’s total energy mix by 2030� A large share 
of energy demand will need to be supplied by imports, increasing energy security risks� Growing reliance on 
coal imports will add to India’s existing import dependency for oil and gas�

India’s  total  gross  power  capacity  will  more  than  double  from  284  gigawatts  (GW)  in  2015  to  an 
estimated 670 GW by 2030, while electricity generation more than triples from 1 100 terawatt-hours 
(TWh) per year to over 3 450 TWh per year. More than three-quarters of this new production is to be met 
by new coal-based capacity, according to current plans and policies (the Reference Case in this study)� The 
planned growth in renewable power capacity, while significant, is low by comparison� India has set a target 
of 175 GW of renewable energy in power generation by 2022, but developments after that date are uncertain�
Policy  makers  have  thus  far  overlooked  the  potential  of  renewable  energy  in  heating,  cooling  and 
transport. Apart from the rising electricity demand, India has started to witness very rapid energy demand 
growth for heating, cooling and transport� National plans currently envisage the vast majority of this being 
met with fossil fuels� The significant renewable potential in these end-use sectors could also be harnessed to 
address India’s energy supply challenges�
An affordable, secure and sustainable energy mix
With  one  of  the  world’s  largest  and  most  ambitious  renewable  energy  programmes,  India  can  take 
a  leading  role  in  a  renewable  energy  transformation  both  regionally  and  globally.  The  International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has developed a roadmap to 2030 (REmap) to explore different energy 
technology  options,  highlighting  ways  to  increase  the  uptake  of  renewable  energy  beyond  the  country’s 
present policies and plans� This report has benefited from consultation and input over the course of two

years from India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and numerous other stakeholders� The 
country has already devoted considerable attention to renewables in its energy policy, becoming the first 
in the world to set up a ministry dedicated exclusively to new and renewable energy sources as long ago as 
1992� Wind and solar policy and targets have, however, only achieved mixed success over the past two and 
a half decades� India has set a target to install 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, showing an 
awareness of how the marketplace for renewable energy technologies is changing�
Renewable energy has emerged, with growing frequency, as the least-cost option to meet India’s rising 
energy needs. Wind, bioenergy, small hydropower and solar photovoltaics (PV) have all become increasingly 
competitive with fossil-fuel-based power generation: a 2016 tender for solar PV in India, for example, produced 
bids of around United States dollar (USD) 0�06-0�07 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) (Indian Rupee (INR) 4�78/kWh)� 
But increasingly competitive production costs are not the only reason to promote renewable energy� Other 
motivations  include  reducing  exposure  to  fossil-fuel  price  volatility,  improving  a  heavily  burdened  grid 
infrastructure, further expanding access to modern energy services, curbing air pollution and meeting the 
country’s sustainability targets�
India must help to drive a comprehensive solution to climate change. Its Intended Nationally Determined 
Contribution (INDC), submitted in October 2015, confirmed the country’s previous, voluntary goal to reduce 
its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity by 20-25% by 2020 (compared with 2005 levels) and went 
further to pledge a reduction target of 33-35% by 2030 and to increase the share of renewables in installed 
capacity to up to 40% by the same year� This report confirms that India can achieve these targets – and 
shows how far it can realistically go beyond them� In addition, the REmap analysis also shows that the country 
has the potential to contribute 10% of the global carbon dioxide (CO2) emission mitigation potential from 
renewable energy by 2030 that is needed, when combined with increased energy efficiency, to set the work 
on a pathway consistent with the Paris Agreement�

Renewable power will maintain its strong growth in the Indian market reaching 35% share of generation, 
and  60%  share  of  power  generation  capacity.  The  REmap  Options  –  outlined  in  this  report  represent 
accelerated  uptake  of  renewable  energy  beyond  the  country’s  current  plans  to  2030�  Accordingly,  total 
wind power capacity would reach 185 GW by 2030, almost eight times its level at the end of 2015� Solar PV 
capacity would increase even more than wind, a total installed capacity of almost 200 GW by 2030, with 
additional capacity in off-grid� Renewable power’s share of total power generation capacity would increase 
to 60% in REmap, compared to 39% with expected developments (the Reference Case)� Thus, India’s INDC 
pledge of reaching a renewable energy share of 40% by 2030 is possible – and much more can be achieved� 
Similarly, the country can achieve a 35% share for renewables in power generation�
Integrating large shares of variable power generation requires planning, and developing a future grid. 
Much of the additional renewable electricity generation deployed in REmap would be variable (such as solar 
PV and wind), and often split into relatively decentralised generation units� As a result, variable renewable 
electricity would account for around 20% of total electricity generation, and 45% of installed power capacity 
in REmap by 2030, placing an increased strain on India’s already stressed transmission and distribution grid� 
Solutions are needed to reinforce, expand and increase the grid and enhance the flexibility of power-system 
infrastructure, while incorporating storage options, demand-response, flexibility measures and reducing grid 
losses�

India can raise its final renewable energy use to approximately 9.3 exajoules (EJ) by 2030 – equivalent 
to 222 million tonnes of oil or a quarter of the country’s total final energy demand. Realising this potential, 
however, calls for more than increasing renewable power generation� Electricity would account for around 
only 40% of the country’s total final renewable energy use by 2030, even with REmap Options put into effect� 
The remaining 60% of renewables would be used in heating, cooling and transport�
Bioenergy and solar energy are essential parts of the resource mix to realise India’s renewable energy 
potential.  Various  forms  of  biofuel  –  for  transport,  as  well  as  for  generating  electricity  and  heat  –  could 
account  for  62%  of  total  final  renewable  energy  use  in  REmap  in  2030�  Solar  (both  photovoltaics  and 
thermal), at 16%, would represent the second largest source of renewable energy use, followed by wind at 
14%, and hydropower at 7%�
India  could  have  23  million  electric  four-wheeled  vehicles  and  300  million  electric  two-and-three-
wheelers  on  the  road  by  2030.  While  biofuels  are  also  becoming  prominent,  the  use  of  electricity  in 
transport needs to increase as part of the country’s transition to renewables� Structural changes – including 
highly improved, increasingly sustainable options for both urban and longer-distance travel – could shift 7% 
of the country’s passenger activity from individual vehicles to electrified mass transit�
India could become the fourth largest renewable energy market worldwide by 2030. It could account 
for  9%  of  all  global  final  renewable  energy  use,  after  China,  the  United  States  and  the  European  Union, 
assuming all countries achieve the potential highlighted in REmap studies� REmap – IRENA’s global roadmap 
– indicates the technology and policy choices needed to significantly increase the share of renewables in the 
global energy mix by 2030�
Benefits of more renewable energy
The  higher  renewable  energy  uptake  taking  place  in  REmap  would  result  in  savings  twelve  times 
higher than costs. This  is  the  result  of  reduced  costs  from  fossil  fuel  externalities  related  to  air  pollution

and  climate  change  related  savings  due  to  renewable  energy�  Savings  from  reduced  air  pollution  alone 
would total between USD 45 billion and USD 160 billion per year� Cutting energy-related CO2 emissions by 
750 megatonnes a year by 2030 would save another USD 13 billion–USD 63 billion per year� Other benefits 
of renewables – related to energy access, energy security and other macroeconomic factors (e�g� impact on 
the trade balance or gross domestic product (GDP)) – would add more to India’s savings�
Accelerated energy efficiency improvements can ease India’s supply constraints as well as yield a higher 
renewable energy share. Along with restraining overall demand, improved energy efficiency will help  to 
meet India’s ambitious GHG emission-reduction goals�
Studies  indicate  that  India  could  have  over  a  million  jobs  in  solar  energy  and  over  180 000  in  wind 
energy by 2022. The prospect of rapid job creation, a major driver of policy in India, is among the strong 
macroeconomic benefits of the transition to renewables� To achieve this employment potential, the country 
must first meet an urgent, and currently unsatisfied, need for training and skills development in the renewable 
energy sector�
India has limited sources of fossil fuels and is not geographically adjacent to any major sources of oil or 
natural gas supply, making it vulnerable to geopolitical and geo-economic shocks. Local coal resources 
are  of  poor  quality  (with  high  ash  content),  prompting  the  country  to  turn  increasingly  to  imports�  This 
will add to concerns about the security of energy supply� Renewable energy offers the dual advantage of 
improving  energy  access  for  poor  communities  and  bolstering  energy  security  through  diversified,  and 
7
largely indigenous, sources of supply� The renewable energy technologies identified in REmap would lower 
the demand for coal and oil products between 17% and 23% by 2030�
Investment in renewables can help drive India’s future economic growth. The energy transition envisaged 
in this report would involve average annual investments of USD 42 billion in renewable energy technologies 
between now and 2030� These include the USD 16 billion annually taking place in the Reference Case, and 
the USD 26 billion for additional renewable energy options identified in REmap�
Challenges for renewable energy deployment
Investment in renewable energy capacity needs to gain impetus to meet near-term targets, as well as 
achieve India’s longer term potential. The investment challenge must address the higher upfront costs of 
renewables  and  the  uncertainty  of  long-term  revenue  generation�  Currency  hedging  can  impede  project 
development: investing in local currency adds 6-8 percentage points to the weighted average cost of capital, 
compared to investments made in US dollars�
While the transition to renewables calls for a more decentralised energy market, this entails its own set 
of challenges. One of these is public perception, which continues to favour centralised grid-based electricity: 
this is compounded by the absence of strong regulatory frameworks for distributed renewable energy� The 
big  challenge  for  distributed  renewables  is  to  develop  business  and  financing  models  that  trigger  rapid 
deployment  and  growth  in  ownership,  particularly  at  the  residential  scale�  At  present,  the  decentralised 
market is characterised by numerous different subsidies and standards, which are often not monitored or 
implemented effectively�
Reliable,  affordable,  secure  electricity  production  is  essential  to  ensure  continued  industrial  and 
commercial  growth  and  satisfy  rising  residential  demand.  India’s  grid  infrastructure  is  already  strained 
and needs major improvements� Transmission and distribution losses are among the highest in the world: 
one-quarter of total electricity generation, rising as high as two-thirds in some states� As the share of variable 
renewables  (solar  and  wind)  increases,  the  pressure  will  continue  to  mount  on  India’s  already  stressed 
transmission and distribution grid� Integrating this growing variability will require greater flexibility in power-
system infrastructure and storage�
India needs to develop a skilled and knowledgeable workforce to realise significant growth in renewable 
energy. The lack of employees trained in the skills needed to construct and operate decentralised renewable 
energy systems is a continuing challenge and a barrier to meeting renewable energy targets�
Modern bioenergy can be a key source of heat and power, particularly for rural populations. There is 
a  pressing  need  to  increase  access  to  modern  energy  sources  for  hundreds  of  millions  of  India’s  people� 
Households consume nearly 39% of total energy in India, with around three-quarters of this consisting of 
traditional uses of bioenergy, which is unhealthy and unsustainable� In contrast to such traditional sources, 
modern bioenergy offers important socio-economic and human health benefits, particularly through efficient 
cookstoves�
Transport accounts for more than half of India’s total petroleum consumption, and electrification offers a 
way to reduce this demand. The country requires massive infrastructure investments to realise the potential 
of electric mobility and electrified mass-transit� It must also make the resulting electricity use secure and 
sustainable�
The interlinkage between water, energy and food supply is a major consideration in India. Demand for 
all three is rising fast as the population and economy grow� 79% of India’s new energy capacity is expected 
to be built in areas that already face water scarcity or water stress�
8
Areas for Action
India is a country with a tremendously dynamic and vibrant renewable energy market� The country is seeing 
activity taking place on many fronts, with lots of on the ground innovation and technology development 
occurring, and policy measures being taken on many levels� However, there are key areas where additional 
solutions are needed for India to realise significantly higher renewable energy uptake�
The full report discusses these solutions and associated challenges in greater depth� It outlines five main 
areas of action:
Establishing transition pathways for renewable energy
1. 
Policy support for renewables needs to be durable and credible� It should be supplemented by intermediate 
targets that are monitored and, when necessary, revised� Specific advances would include:
 ●
Improving the enforcement of renewable energy purchase obligations (RPOs);
 ●
Creating conducive land acquisition policies; and
 ●
Establishing priority-sector lending for renewables;
 ●
Increasing outreach to banks and establish a Green Bank; and
 ●
Promoting energy efficiency and renewable-based energy access�
Creating an enabling business environment
2. 
Improvements in the business environment and the development of new business models would help to scale 
up renewable energy technologies in India� Unstable policies, administrative delays, bureaucratic malpractice 
and the absence of clear information all hinder the growth of renewables in the country’s energy mix�
Solutions include:
 ●
Developing policy frameworks that provide a level playing field for renewable energy and facilitate 
the formation of markets;
 ●
Ensuring  transparent  bidding  processes,  with  rigorous  selection  criteria  and  broad  stakeholder 
participation;
 ●
Reduce  or  mitigate  red  tape�  Existing  policies  are  often  shackled  by  slow-moving  bureaucratic 
procedures that discourage interest from investors and project developers;
 ●
Mobilise  investments  and  reduce  the  costs  of  financing  and  currency  risks  by  establishing  risk 
mitigation instruments and other funds and facilities dedicated to renewables; and
 ●
Reflect the true costs of fossil fuels in energy pricing by including externalities relating to air pollution 
and carbon emissions�
Integrating renewable energy
3. 
The Indian transmission and distribution grid is strained� Increasing its robustness and capacity is paramount 
for  the  transition  to  a  sustainable  energy  future�  Along  with  integrating  renewable  power,  India  needs  a 
holistic  approach  to  energy  development  that  recognises  the  linkages  between  electricity,  heating  and 
9
transport needs� These linkages include both an emphasis on utilising renewable power in end-uses, but also 
better collection of biofuel wastes and their utilisation�
Some solutions include:
 ●
Strengthen transmission grids, reducing grid losses, and improving the resilience of the power system 
by investing in more flexible, dispatchable capacity, demand-response, interconnectors and storage, 
as well as utilising transport/power-sector synergies�
 ●
Giving  incentives  to  renewable  energy  project  developers,  such  as  first  access  to  the  power  grid 
through priority dispatch schemes;
 ●
Encouraging  the  use  of  information  and  communication  technologies  for  managing  peak  loads, 
especially in cities, which can also help to integrate renewable power;
 ●
Supporting  research  into  the  synergies  between  electric  mobility  and  renewable  power,  while 
developing renewable solutions that are applicable to India’s often unique energy environment; and
 ●
Creating a national bioenergy mission focused on helping to meet industrial energy demand, including 
increasing the collection of agricultural, forest and waste residues�
4.  Managing knowledge
India needs better data and increasingly specialised skills and knowledge to maximise its renewable energy 
potential� Timely and robust data must be made available, and relevant skills must be developed�
Knowledge-management measures could include:
 ●
Regular data collection from developers on the status of projects, capacity added per year, and the 
jobs created;
 ●
Information platforms for lending institutions to encourage partnerships between banks;
 ●
Improved air pollution emission standards raised to the level of those in Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries; and
 ●
Programmes to increase the awareness of modern energy technologies and their maintenance�
Unleashing innovation
5. 
Renewable energy deployment around the world depends on a combination of technological improvements, 
new applications of existing technologies, systemic creation of new business or financing models, and new, 
more  inclusive  policy  mechanisms�  India,  with  its  endemic  problem  of  access  to  energy,  has  seen  much 
innovation in low-cost renewable applications and is constantly evolving distribution and financing models�
Further ways to spur innovative solutions include:
 ●
Incorporating renewable energy standards into the building codes for all new buildings in cities; and
 ●
Promoting  technological  development  in  energy  storage,  energy  monitoring  and  mechanisms  to 
maintain a system balance�

1.  INTRODUCTION
12% in 2030 (excluding traditional uses of biomass1)� This 
Reference Case is conservative on renewables and does 
not  include  all  the  accelerated  commitments,  such  as 
in India’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 
(INDC)�
REmap is the global renewable energy roadmap of the 
International  Renewable  Energy  Agency  (IRENA)�  It 
shows  how  accelerating  the  penetration  of  renewable 
energy  in  individual  countries  could  contribute  to 
doubling its share of the global energy mix by 2030�
India  has  significant  potential  to  go  further  if  all  the 
potential renewable energy options identified in REmap 
are deployed in addition to those in the Reference Case� 
The  deployment  required  to  fill  the  gap  is  called  the 
‘REmap  Options:’  these  include  –  but  also  go  beyond 
– meeting India’s commitments in the INDC� Given the 
size  of  the  country,  renewable  energy  technologies  – 
and their related potentials – vary from region to region: 
which  include  geothermal,  wind  and  various  forms  of 
solar and biomass�
Key  factors  in  achieving  such  a  doubling  include 
increased  use  of  wind  and  solar  technologies,  greater 
electrification,  and  the  use  of  biomass  for  heating, 
cooking,  power  generation  and  biofuels�  Based  on 
analysing  40  countries,  representing  80%  of  global 
energy  demand,  REmap  suggests  that  existing  and 
future renewable energy expansion, as currently planned, 
will result in a 21% share of total renewables worldwide 
in  2030  (IRENA,  2016a)�  A  doubling  would  result  in  a 
36%  share,  so  there  is  a  15%  gap  (World  Bank,  2015)� 
Each country will play a role in the global doubling, but 
this does not mean that every country would double its 
renewable energy share�
This national potential is of global importance� Figure 8 
provides  a  breakdown  of  total  renewable  energy  use 
across  the  40  countries  that  have  developed  REmap 
Options�  Four  countries  account  for  half  of  the  total 
renewable energy that could be consumed by 2030, and 
if the European Union (EU) is considered the share rises 
to two-thirds� India would be the third largest country 
consuming  renewable  energy,  accounting  for  9%  of 
the global total� So engaging India – together with the 
other largest users such as Brazil, China, the EU and the 
United States (US) – is essential if the goal of doubling 
renewable energy’s global share is to be achieved�
REmap is the result of a collaborative process between 
IRENA,  national  REmap  experts  within  the  individual 
countries  and  other  stakeholders�  The  current  report 
focuses  on  the  actual  and  potential  role  of  renewable 
energy in India, a major energy producer and consumer, 
which accounts for a growing share of carbon dioxide 
(CO2)  emissions�  India  is  one  of  the  world’s  largest 
energy consumers with a total final energy consumption 
(TFEC)  of  17�4  exajoules  (EJ)  in  2010,  5%  of  the  total 
global TFEC (International Energy Agency (IEA), 2014)� 
India’s TFEC is growing on average by 5% per year and 
stood at more than 20 EJ in 2014� The country is home 
to 16% of the world’s population, has very low per capita 
energy consumption and is growing rapidly – so many 
see it as one of the world’s largest sources of increased 
energy demand in the coming decades�
Four countries (Brazil, China, India and the 
US) could account for half of global use of 
renewable energy by 2030
The  objective  of  this  report  is  to  provide  detailed 
background  data,  and  the  results  of  the  India  REmap 
country  analysis,  and  to  then  make  suggestions  as  to 
how these results could be translated into action�
India’s TFEC is projected to more than double between 
2010 and 2030, according to the baseline scenario of the 
Planning Commission of the Government of India (GOI, 
2014b)� Over the same period, – according to this study 
and  estimates  by  the  Council  on  Energy,  Environment 
and Water (CEEW) – the share of modern renewables 
in  India’s  TFEC  would  decrease  from  17%  in  2010  to 
1  Estimates for traditional uses of biomass vary widely depending on 
the source�

This report starts with a brief description of the REmap 
methodology (Chapter 2)� It continues by explaining the 
present energy situation and recent trends of renewable 
energy use (Chapter 3)� Chapter 4 discusses the current 
policy  framework  and  drivers  for  renewables  in  India� 
Chapter 5 discusses the potential of different renewable 
energy resources in India� Chapter 6 provides details of 
the India Reference Case findings – the business-as-usual 
scenario – to 2030� Chapter 7, the heart of the report, 
quantifies  the  REmap  Options  –  the  potential  to  go 
beyond the uptake of renewable energy outlined in the 
Reference Case� This is followed by a discussion of the 
opportunities  and  barriers  for  renewable  energy  use 
in  India  (Chapter  8),  while  Chapter  9  provides  policy 
recommendations  for  accelerating  renewable  energy 
uptake�

2.  METHODOLOGY AND DATA SOURCES
This  section  explains  the  REmap  methodology  and 
provides information about the background data used 
for the analysis of India� Annexes A-G provide the data 
and background assumptions in greater detail�
for the selection of what constitutes a Reference Case 
was  made  based  on  discussions  with  the  Ministry  of 
New  and  Renewable  Energy  (MNRE),  as  many  of  the 
aims of India’s INDC are consistent with an accelerated 
renewables case�
REmap  is  an  analytical  approach  for  assessing  the 
gap between current national renewable energy plans, 
additional  renewable  technology  options  potentially 
available  in  2030,  and  the  Sustainable  Energy  for  All 
(SE4All)  objective  of  doubling  the  share  of  global 
renewable energy by 2030�
Once  the  Reference  Case  was  prepared,  additional 
technology  options  were  identified,  known  in  this 
report as the REmap Options� The choice of an options 
approach instead of a scenario one is deliberate: REmap 
is an exploratory study, not a target-setting exercise�
As  of  March  2016,  40  countries  representing  80%  of 
global  energy  use,  are  included  in  Remap:  Argentina, 
Australia,  Belgium,  Brazil,  Canada,  China,  Colombia, 
Cyprus,  Denmark,  the  Dominican  Republic,  Ecuador, 
Egypt,  Ethiopia,  France,  Germany,  India  (the  present 
study), Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, 
Kuwait,  Malaysia,  Mexico,  Morocco,  Nigeria,  Poland, 
the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  Russian  Federation,  Saudi 
Arabia,  South  Africa,  Sweden,  Tonga,  Turkey,  Ukraine, 
the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the US 
and Uruguay�
The  sources  of  the  REmap  Options  for  India  originate 
from a range of research that includes:
 ●
For  the  power  sector:  Planning  Commission 
(GOI,  2014b)  and  Global  Change  Assessment 
Model  (GCAM)  estimates  of  the  CEEW,  and 
India’s INDC;
 ●
For  heating  (in  the  buildings  and  industry 
sectors): Solar Water Heaters in India (GOI, 2010) 
and  the  IRENA  renewable  energy  in  industry 
roadmap (IRENA, 2014b) with its accompanying 
data;
The  analysis  starts  with  national-level  data  covering 
both the power generation and end-use energy demand 
(in  buildings,  industry,  transport  and  agriculture)� 
Current national plans, using 2010 as the base year of 
this  analysis,  form  the  starting  point�2  The  Reference 
Case represents policies in place or under consideration, 
including any energy efficiency improvements contained 
in these projections� It includes the TFEC of each end-
use sector and the total generation of power and district 
heat sectors, and a breakdown by energy carrier for the 
period  2010–2030�  The  Reference  Case  for  India  was 
based on the estimates from the Planning Commission 
of the Government of India (GOI, 2014b) and the CEEW� 
Where  necessary,  2010  IEA  energy  balances  for  India 
have  been  updated  with  information  originating  from 
other national sources or other estimates� The Reference 
Case  assessment  was  prepared  before  the  release  of 
India’s  INDC  in  late  2015�  The  choice  of  this  approach 
 ●
For  the  transport  sector:  Planning  Commission 
(GOI,  2014b),  Vision  2020  –  A  Blueprint  for 
Railway  Electrification  Programme  (GOI,  2011), 
and National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020 
(GOI, 2012) were mainly used; and
 ●
Additionally, expert opinions from MNRE, IRENA 
and  external  authorities  were  incorporated  into 
the  analysis�  These  were  primarily  the  sources 
of some biomass, off-grid and renewable power 
technology assessments�
IRENA  has  developed  a  REmap  tool  that  allows  users 
to  input  data  into  an  energy  balance  for  2010,  2020 
and  2030,  and  then  assess  technology  options  that 
could  be  deployed  by  2030  that  are  consistent  with

detailed  list  of  these  technologies  and  the  related 
background  data  are  provided  online,  in  addition  to

what is contained in the Annexes to this report� The tool 
includes the cost (capital, operation and maintenance) 
and  technical  performance  (reference  capacity  of 
installation,  capacity  factor  and  conversion  efficiency) 
of renewable and conventional (fossil fuel, nuclear and 
traditional use of biomass) technologies for each sector 
that  is  analysed:  industry,  buildings,  transport,  power 
and district heat�
energy taxes, subsidies and a national cost of capital of 
12% for India) in order to generate a national cost curve, 
showing  the  cost  of  the  transition  as  calculated  by 
businesses  and  investors�  Assessment  of  all  additional 
costs related to complementary infrastructure – such as 
transmission lines, reserve power needs, energy storage 
or fuel stations – are excluded from this study� However, 
the  report  discusses  the  implications  of  infrastructure 
needs on total system costs, where relevant, based on a 
review of comparable literature�
Each  renewable  energy  technology  is  characterised 
by  its  costs,  and  the  cost  of  each  REmap  Option  is 
represented  by  its  substitution  cost  –  the  difference 
between the annualised cost of the REmap Option and 
that of a conventional technology used to produce the 
same amount of energy, divided by the total renewable 
energy use in final energy terms (in 2010 real US Dollar 
(USD)  per  gigajoule  (GJ)  of  final  renewable  energy)�3 
This  indicator  provides  a  comparable  metric  for  all 
renewable energy technologies identified in each sector�
Throughout  this  study,  the  share  of  renewable  energy 
estimated  is  related  to  TFEC�4  It  includes  all  six  forms 
of  renewables:  biomass,  geothermal,  hydropower 
(small  and  large),  ocean,  solar  and  wind�  It  can  be 
estimated  including,  or  excluding,  traditional  forms  of 
biomass:  if  they  are  excluded,  the  share  would  refer 
only  to  modern  renewables�  It  can  be  estimated  for 
the  total  of  all  end-use  sectors  of  India  or  for  each  of 
them  individually  (with  or  without  the  contribution  of 
renewable  electricity)�  The  share  of  renewable  power 
generation  is  also  calculated�  Further  details  of  the 
REmap  methodology  can  be  found  online  in  IRENA’s 
REmap  webpage  at:  www.irena.org/remap  and  in  the 
REmap global reports (IRENA 2014a, 2016a)�
Substitution  costs  are  the  key  indicators  for  assessing 
the economic viability of REmap Options� They depend 
on the type of conventional technology substituted, on 
energy prices and on the characteristics of the Option� 
The  cost  can  be  positive  (incremental)  or  negative 
(savings), as many renewable energy technologies are 
already  cost-effective  compared  with  conventional 
technologies,  or  could  be  so  by  2030  as  a  result  of 
cost-reduction  driven  by  technological  learning  and 
economies of scale�
This  report  also  discusses  the  financial  needs  and 
avoided  externalities  that  relate  to  renewable  energy� 
Several financial indicators are developed:
Incremental  system  costs:  This  is  the  sum  of  the 
differences  between  the  total  capital  (in  USD/yr) 
and  operating  expenditures  (in  USD/yr)  of  all  energy 
technologies based on their deployment in REmap and 
the Reference Case in a given year;
Based  on  the  substitution  cost  and  the  potential 
of  each  REmap  Option,  country  cost  supply  curves 
were  developed  from  two  perspectives  –  government 
and  business  –  for  the  year  2030�  In  the  government 
perspective, costs exclude energy taxes and subsidies, 
and  a  standard  10%  discount  rate  was  used,  allowing 
comparison  across  countries  and  aggregation  of 
results on a regional, sector or global level� Estimating 
a  government  perspective  allows  for  a  country  cost-
benefit  analysis  and  for  comparison  of  the  40  REmap 
countries with each other; it shows the cost of doubling 
the  global  renewable  energy  share  as  calculated  by 
governments�
 ●
investment  needs:  This 
is  the 
Incremental 
difference between the annual investment needs 
of all REmap Options and the investment needs 
of  the  substituted  conventional  technologies� 
Investment needs for renewable energy capacity 
are estimated for each technology by multiplying 
its  total  deployment  (in  gigawatts  (GW))  to 
deliver the same energy service as conventional 
4  The share of renewable energy share is estimated by dividing total 
final  renewable  energy  use  by  the  TFEC�  Total  final  renewable 
energy use includes: (i) total renewable fuel use in end-use sectors 
to  generate  heat  (process  heat,  space/water  heating,  cooking, 
etc�);  (ii)  renewable  motor  fuels  in  the  transport  sector;  and 
(iii)  total  power  and  district  heat  consumption  generated  from 
renewable sources�
For the business perspective, the process was repeated 
to  include  national  prices  (including,  for  example, 
3 
Indian Rupee (INR) was equivalent to 0�0219 US Dollars (USD) in 
2010�
1 4
capacity  and  the  investment  costs  (in  USD  per 
kilowatt  (kW))  for  the  period  2010-2030�  This 
total is then annualised by dividing the number 
of years covered by the analysis;
per  tonne  of  CO2  is  assumed  (IPCC,  2007)  and 
is applied only to emissions of CO2, and not for 
other greenhouse gases� According to the IPCC 
(2007), the carbon price should reflect the social 
cost of mitigating one tonne of CO2 equivalent in 
GHG emissions�
 ●
Subsidy  needs  (also  labelled  as  ‘investment 
support’ in the report): Total subsidy requirements 
for  renewables  are  estimated  as  the  difference 
in  the  delivered  energy  service  costs  for  the 
REmap Option (in USD/GJ final energy) relative 
to its conventional counterpart multiplied by its 
deployment  in  a  given  year  (in  petajoules  (PJ) 
per year)�
The external costs related to human health are estimated 
separately,  which  excludes  any  effect  related  to  GHG 
emissions�  Outdoor  air  pollution  is  evaluated  from: 
outdoor  emission  of  sulphur  dioxide  (SO2),  nitrogen 
oxides  (NOx)  and  particulate  matter  of  less  than 
2�5  micrometres  (PM2�5)  from  fossil  fuel-based  power 
plant  operation;  and  outdoor  emissions  of  NOx,  and 
PM2�5 from road vehicles
 ●
External  effects  related  to  CO2  emission 
reductions  and  improvements  in  outdoor  and 
indoor  air  pollution  from  the  decreased  use  of 
fossil  fuels  have  also  been  estimated�  As  a  first 
step,  CO2 emissions  from  fossil  fuel  combustion 
are estimated for each sector and energy carrier, 
multiplying  the  energy  content  of  each  type  of 
fossil fuel by its default emission factors (based 
on  lower  heating  values)  as  provided  by  the 
Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change 
(IPPC) (Eggleston et al�, 2006)� Emissions were 
estimated  separately  for  the  Reference  Case 
and REmap: the difference between them yields 
the  total net  CO2 emission reduction from fossil 
fuel  combustion  due  to  increased  renewable 
energy use� A carbon price range of USD 17-80 
To  evaluate  the  external  costs  related  to  outdoor 
emissions of SO2, NOx and PM2�5 from fossil power plant 
operation,  the  following  parameters  were  used:  the 
emission factor (i�e� tonne per kWh for 2010 and 2030 
taken from the International Institute for Applied Systems 
Analysis  (IIASA)  GAINS  database  ECRIPSE  scenario 
(IIASA, 2014)); and the unit external costs (i�e� Euro-per-
tonne average for the EU, adapted for India from the EU 
CAFE  project  (AEA  Technology  Environment,  2005))� 
Values  for  the  potential  differences  in  external  effects 
between the EU and India are accounted for based on 
the  difference  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)�  An 
extended  version  of  the  methodology  of  the  REmap 
analysis can be found online�5

3.   RECENT TRENDS FOR RENEWABLE 
ENERGY AND THE PRESENT ENERGY 
SITUATION
Key points
Nuclear  power  accounts  for  the  remaining  2% 
(5�8  GW)�  The  share  of  renewables  fluctuated 
between  13%  and  19%  between  2000  and  2015, 
meeting 17% of electricity supply in 2015�
India  can  take  the  lead  in  driving  the  energy 
transformation  both  regionally  and  globally 
with  one  of  the  largest,  and  most  ambitious, 
renewable energy programmes anywhere in the 
world� It has set a target of 175 GW of installed 
renewable  energy  capacity  by  2022,  including 
100  GW  of  solar,  60  GW  of  wind,  10  GW  of 
biomass and 5 GW of small hydropower�
 ●
 ●
As  of  2012,  75%  of  India’s  population  had 
reliable  access  to  electricity�  Annual  growth  in 
grid electrification has attained 2% per year, but 
renewables-based off-grid systems are often the 
most economical solution� There are a significant 
number of rice husk gasification mini-grids and 
solar  systems, 
including  solar-with-storage 
mini-grids�
Government agencies are producing increasingly 
strong financial support schemes for renewables� 
international 
Support 
development  banks  has 
reached  over 
USD 1 billion per year� Most of the focus has so 
far been on generating renewable power� Efforts 
on  end-use  are  concentrated  around  improving 
energy efficiency and enabling access to modern 
energy services�
 ●
from 
regional  and 
 ●
India’s grid infrastructure is already strained and 
needs  major  improvements�  Its  transmission 
and  distribution  losses  are  among  the  highest 
in  the  world,  averaging  26%  of  total  electricity 
generation�  When  such  non-technical  losses  as 
energy theft are included, average losses are as 
high as 50% in some regions�
India’s  TFEC  has  been  growing  at  around 
5% per year over the past decade� In 2010 – the 
base  year  for  this  analysis  –  it  stood  at  17�4  EJ 
per year� Renewable energy’s share of that was 
40% – split into 17% for modern renewables and 
23%  for traditional uses of biomass for  cooking 
in  the  residential  sector�  The  share  of  modern 
renewable  energy  included  2�6%  for  renewable 
power, 6�9% for biomass industrial process heat 
and 7�8% for modern biomass for cooking�
 ●
 ●
Bioenergy remains the main source of renewable 
energy in the buildings and industry sector� Solar 
heating,  cooling  and  cooking  technologies  are 
also  used�  Total  installed  solar  water  heating 
capacity reached 8�61 million m2 (6 GW) in 2014 
and solar water heaters meet 0�1% of the building 
sector’s  total  final  energy  demand�  By  March 
2013, there were 4�75 million biogas and manure 
plants in India, around one third of the estimated 
potential� But the consistency and availability of 
data  on  the  use  of  renewables  for  heating  and 
cooling is mixed
Total power generation has been growing at an 
average  annual  rate  of  6%  per  year  during  the 
past decade – exceeding 1 000 TWh in 2014/15, 
double the 2000 level of 500 TWh�
 ●
 ●
India submitted its INDCs to the United Nations 
Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change 
(UNFCCC)  in  October  2015,  pledging  to  reduce 
the emission intensity of its economy, by 2030, 
by  between  33%  and  35%  from  the  2005  level� 
It  has  also  committed  to  increasing  its  share  of 
By March 2016, India’s installed power generation 
capacity had reached 302 GW: 69% of it is thermal� 
Most  of  the  remainder  is  large  hydropower 
(42�6  GW)  and  other  renewables  (37�4  GW)� 
 ●

renewable energy capacity to 40% by 2030� The 
Reference Case shows this share growing to 37%: 
the REmap Option increased it to 60%�
About  two-thirds  of  this  would  be  installed  in  desert 
regions  in  northern  and  western  parts  of  the  country� 
The  plan  is  to  use  5-15%  of  the  wasteland  available  in 
these  regions  to  realise  their  large  potential  for  solar 
and wind� Using 95% of the available potential on 10% 
of the area would be equivalent to 271 GW of total solar 
photovoltaic (PV) capacity and 29 GW of total wind�
 ●
India  increasingly  is  importing  fossil  fuels�  Its 
demand  for  coal  is  expected  to  reach  1 300 
million tonnes per year (Mt/yr�) (35 EJ) by 2025 
with  15%  of  it  (200  Mt)  being  met  from  other 
countries�  The  country’s  crude  oil  production 
has reached 1�6 EJ, and it imported an additional 
7�9  EJ�  Annual  domestic  production  has  been 
stagnant  at  0�83  million  barrels  per  day  over 
past years, and the import dependency of crude 
oil and refinery throughput are 76% and 84�7%, 
respectively�  The  Twelth  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP) 
expects  imports  to  increase  by  50%  between 
2012 and 2017� Total natural gas production was 
1�3 EJ with 0�3 EJ being imported� Consumption 
of natural gas is growing the fastest among fossil 
fuels, increasing by 12% per year, between 2007 
and 2012�
The new Indian government is pushing for investments in 
renewable power generation technologies amounting to 
USD 100 billion over the period to 2019� There is also strong 
financial support for renewables in the country� In 2015 
clean energy investment increased to USD 10�9 billion, in 
line with expectations� This represented an increase from 
the previous two years, but was still below the 2011 record 
of USD 13�1 billion� The amount of support received from 
such  institutions  as  the  US  Export  Bank,  KfW,  the  Asia 
Development Bank (ADB) and the European Investment 
Bank (EIB) has reached USD 1 billion in recent years� India 
is also to receive funds from the World Bank to support 
one  of  its  first  ultra-mega  solar  projects,  with  a  total 
installed  capacity  of  750  megawatts  (MW),  in  Madhya 
Pradesh�  (Cleantechnica,  2014c)�  The  Government 
is  now  permitting  full  foreign  direct  investment  and 
is  encouraging  the  transfer  of  foreign  technologies, 
including  renewables  (GOI,  2014a):  so  far,  co-operation 
frameworks  have  been  established  with  44  countries� 
(MNRE, 2016a)�
3�1 
 Recent developments and 
long-term objectives
India ranks sixth in the world in total installed renewable 
power generation capacity after China, the US, Germany, 
Spain  and  Italy�  It  recently  set  a  target  of  175  GW  for 
2022, which implies that renewable energy would then 
contribute  close  to  20%  of  the  country’s  total  power 
consumption� The Government has raised the increase 
in  solar  power  capacity  from  22  GW  to  100  GW  by 
2022,  while  wind  is  to  increase  to  60  GW�  There  are 
also targets of 10 GW for biomass and 5 GW from small 
hydropower for 2022 (Cleantechnica, 2015a)� No target 
for concentrated solar power (CSP) exists�
A target of 4 460 MW additional capacity has been set 
for  2015/16,  just  a  quarter  higher  than  the  one  set  for 
2014/15� The Government has allocated USD 400 million 
to  facilitate  deployment  (Cleantechnica,  2015a)�  It  is 
collecting  considerable  tax  revenue  from  coal  imports 
and  production,  which  goes  to  the  National  Clean 
Energy  Fund  to  finance  renewable  energy  projects� 
Coal  taxes  have  been  doubled  to  USD  3�3  per  tonne 
(t)  of  coal  to  increase  revenue  (Cleantechnica,  2015a)� 
But  the  industry  views  the  fund  availability  as  limited, 
when set against the growing renewable energy targets 
(The Hindu, 2015)�
This would require 15 GW of annual solar installations in 
the next five years, slightly higher than China achieved 
in  2015�  India’s  new  government  plans  to  use  solar 
power to electrify the homes of over 300 million people 
who do not now have access to power by 2019, as part 
of enhancing its plans to implement the National Solar 
Mission (Cleantechnica, 2014b) using panels designed to 
light two bulbs and to operate a cooker and a TV set in 
each home (Bloomberg, 2014a; Cleantechnica, 2014b)�
So  far,  most  of  the  focus  on  renewable  energy  is  in 
the  power  sector,  while  efforts  in  end-use  sectors  are 
concentrated  around  improving  energy  efficiency� 
The  Government  has  set  a  fuel  economy  standard  for 
new  cars  and  trucks:  petrol  mileage  was  projected  to 
increase by 14% by the beginning of 2016, followed by a 
mandate to increase it by 38% between 2021 and 2022� 
The current average efficiency of 37�6 miles per gallon 
According to Desert Power India, the national target is 
to add 455 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2050� 
1 7
(mpg) (16 kilometres per litre, (km/l)) should increase to 
42�8 mpg (18�2 km/l) by 2016/17, and 51�7 mpg (22 km/l) 
by  2021/22  as  a  result  (GreenCarReports,  2014)�  The 
Jawaharlal  Nehru  National  Solar  Mission  (JNNSM) 
Phase-II set targets of 15 million square metres of solar 
water heating collectors by 2017, and 20 million by 2022, 
respectively�
capacity is included, renewable power capacity in India 
increases to around 42 GW� In 2015-16, 3�1 GW of new 
grid-connected  renewable  power  capacity  (excluding 
large  hydropower)  was  installed�  By  the  end  of  2015, 
wind  energy  accounted  for  the  largest  share  of  total 
capacity at 25�1 GW, followed by solar power at 4�9 GW, 
biomass  power  at  4�6  GW  and  small  hydropower  at 
4�2 GW (MNRE, 2016b)�
India should take a leadership role in driving 
the energy transformation both regionally 
and globally with one of the largest 
and most ambitious renewable energy 
programmes in the world
Wind  power  has  accounted  for  the  majority  of  the 
capacity  growth,  with  an  average  installation  rate  of 
2  GW  a  year,  though  this  fell  to  1�65  GW  in  2015/16� 
The  year  2011  was  exceptional,  with  3�2  GW  wind 
capacity installed� Annual solar PV capacity installation 
is  increasing,  averaging  900  MW  per  year  since  2011 
(2015/16  saw  an  annual  1�1  GW  increase)�  Prior  to 
2011,  annual  installed  capacity  was  below  30  MW 
(MNRE,  2014b)�  Indian  Railways  now  has  10  MW 
of  solar  capacity  in  small  solar  PV  plants  in  about 
500 stations and buildings, and is targeting 1 GW solar 
power capacity over the coming years (Cleantechnica, 
2014d)�
India submitted its INDC to the UNFCCC Secretariat in 
October  2015�  In  the  past  it  had  declared  a  voluntary 
goal  of  reducing  the  emission  intensity  of  its  GDP  by 
20%  to  25%,  from  the  2005  level,  by  2020,  despite 
having  no  binding  obligations  for  mitigation�  The 
INDC  pledged  that  India  will  increase  this  target 
from  33%  to  35%  by  2030,  again  from  the  2005  level 
(Cleantechnica, 2014a)� It also committed to increase its 
share in renewable energy to 40% of installed capacity 
by  2030�  The  INDC  includes  numerous  specific  goals, 
including increasing solar and wind energy to 100 GW 
and 60 GW respectively by 2022, biomass to 10 GW by 
2020, and nuclear power to 63 GW by 2032�
Announcements  for  new  solar  PV  projects  indicate 
a  significant  scale  up  of  utility-scale  ones,  including 
single  projects  as  big  as  1  GW  (Cleantechnica,  2014d; 
2014e;  CEEW,  2015e)�  The  utility  National  Thermal 
Power Corporation Limited has completed a successful 
2  GW  tender  for  solar,  and  additional  tenders  were 
expected  into  2016�  One  of  the  cheapest  solar  power 
purchase  agreements  (PPA)  in  2015  –  at  a  rate  of 
USD  0�077/kWh  –  was  announced  in  Madhya  Pradesh 
(Hindustan  Times,  2015a),  and  more  recent  bids  early 
2016 came in at around USD 0�06-0�07/kWh�
3�2 
 Recent developments in the 
renewable energy sector
Power sector
Installed  power  capacity  in  India  reached  284  GW 
in  December  2015,  and  302  GW  in  March  2016�  Of 
the  total  69%  is  thermal  capacity  (coal,  natural  gas 
and  oil)�  Large  hydropower  makes  up  42�6  GW  and 
other  renewables  38�8  GW,  together  they  represent 
27%  of  the  total  installed  capacity  (excluding  off-grid 
and captive renewable power capacity)� Nuclear power 
accounts for just under 2% at around 5�8 GW of capacity 
(MNRE,  2016b;  Central  Electricity  Authority  (CEA), 
2016)�
The  annual  installation  of  biomass  power  averages 
150  MW  (excluding  off-grid  and  captive  power 
plants)�  Biomass 
in  bagasse  and  non-
bagasse  cogeneration  plants  as  well  as  in  gasifiers, 
biomethanation  and  power-alone  plants�  There  were 
more  than  300  biomass  cogeneration  plants  (500, 
including  non-cogeneration)  with  a  total  installed 
capacity  of  4�5  GW  at  the  end  of  2015�  The  majority 
of  this  capacity  (close  to  3  GW)  is  located  in  sugar 
mills  producing  power  from  bagasse�  Other  grid-
connected  biomass  power  and  gasification  plants 
follow with a total installed capacity of around 1�5 GW 
(MNRE, 2016b)� Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh 
and Uttarakhand – which are also the largest sugar cane 
producing states in India – account for a large share of 
is  used 
In  the  past  five  years,  renewable  energy  capacity 
(excluding 
large  hydropower)  has  experienced 
impressive annual growth that reached 20%� It has more 
than  doubled  since  2009  from  14�8  GW  to  38�8  GW�

depreciation, concessional import duty, and excise duty� 
(see Box 1) (MNRE, n�d� a)�
MNRE  estimates  showed  that  biomass-based  grid-
connected  and  off-grid  power  capacity  targets  have 
been  missed�  The  key  issues  were  the  availability, 
collection, processing, and pricing of such agro-residues 
as  rice  husk,  cotton  stalk,  coconut  shells,  soya  husk, 
coffee waste, and sawdust� (AIREC/SSEF, 2014)�
The total installed off-grid and captive renewable power 
generation  capacity  reached  1 237  MW  by  the  end  of 
2015  (excluded  from  Figure  9)�  Half  of  it  (603  MW) 
was  biomass  (non-bagasse)  cogeneration�  The  total 
installed capacity of biomass gasifiers stood at 179 MW, 
nearly  all  of  it  (161  MW)  in  industrial  plants  with  little 
(18  MW)  in  rural  areas�  The  capacity  of  solar  home 
systems is growing fast: 55 MW capacity was installed in 
2015� Waste-to-energy (147 MW) is the other important

Biomass  power  generation  receives  about  USD 
100  million  of  investment  each  year  in  India:  the 
various  incentives  to  promote  it  include  accelerated 
Box 1: Bagasse-based CHP policy
The  Indian  Government  is  pursuing  its  bagasse-based  cogeneration  potential  through  financial  and  fiscal 
incentives� Plants benefit from a capital subsidy ranging from USD 24 000 to USD 28 800 for privately owned 
sugar mills� The subsidy is also available to existing co-operative or public sugar mills – up to a maximum of 
USD 1�3 million per project – and includes support for surplus power exported to the grid� Fiscal incentives are 
also provided, including 80% accelerated depreciation and concessional import and excise duties� Tapping 
the total industrial co-generation potential in India would require wider policy programmes that also included 
non-bagasse  co-generation  applications�  Such  measures  as  a  more  comprehensive  co-generation  feed-in 
tariff  (FiT)  system,  that  included  biomass  and  other  co-generation  applications  and  open  access  without 
cross-subsidy surcharge, could help achieve greater deployment of co-generation (IEA, 2014)�

Total power generation in India has been growing at 
an average annual rate of 6% during the past decade� 
In  2015/16,  total  generation  reached  1 107  TWh 
(CEA,  2016b),  more  than  double  the  level  in  the 
year  2000  of  500  TWh�  The  country  now  accounts 
for  approximately  4%  of  total  global  electricity 
generation�
economical  solution  to  their  needs  (Szabo  et  al�,  2011; 
Breyer,  2012)�  By  2012,  India’s  electrification  rate  had 
reached  75%  and  the  urban  electrification  rate  that 
year was 94%, with the rural areas reaching 67%� Growth 
rates for grid electrification in India – as in Indonesia and 
the Philippines – have reached 2% per year� (The simple 
arithmetic of expanding centralised grids is misleading, 
however,  especially  in  view  of  the  geographic  realities 
of  mountain  ranges  with  limited  access  such  as  in 
northern  India�)  Fuel  and  light-related  expenditures 
account  for  7-10%  of  total  household  expenditures 
in  India,  significantly  higher  than  in  other  developing 
countries (Dalberg, 2013)�
Renewable  power  generation  has  also  more  than 
doubled  over  the  same  period,  from  about  80  TWh 
in  2000  to  over  200  TWh  in  2015  (see  figure  10)�  It 
represented  17%  of  total  generation  in  2015  made  up 
of: 10% hydropower, 3% wind, 3% biomass, 1% solar PV 
and  0�1%  CSP  (GlobalData,  2016)�  Renewable  power 
generation’s share of the total fluctuated between 13% 
and 19% in the period 2000-2015�
Renewables  for  distributed  generation  are  becoming 
common  to  minimise  the  impact  of  blackouts  and 
load-shedding�  India  frequently  experiences  blackouts 
ranging from a few to eight hours per day, as a result 
of  inadequate  transmission  and  distribution  capacity, 
as  well  as  energy  theft�  Some  cities  and  states  have 
load  shedding  schedules,  giving  some  populations 
access to electricity for only 4-6 hours per day� Kerala, 
for  example,  has  load-shedding  scheduled  between 
6-10  p�m�  each  day�  So  households  are  adopting 
Rural electrification
Seventeen  percent  of  the  world’s  population  –  an 
estimated 1�16 billion people – now live without access 
to electricity� An estimated 615 million of these people 
live in Asia, almost half of them – 304 million – in India� 
Renewables-based off-grid systems are often the most 
2 0
renewables  to  secure  their  electricity  supply  during 
these  hours,  and  manufacturing  industry  is  installing 
biomass supplies and other renewable units to ensure 
continuous power to their businesses�
About  860 000  solar  home  systems,  and  around  750 
mini-grid systems, were installed in India by March 2012� 
The  latter  include  135  biomass  rice  husk  gasification 
systems and 599 solar PV mini-grids, each with between 
10 and 400 customers and a total capacity of 8�2 MW� 
Sales of solar lanterns in Asia amounted to as high as 
3�2  million  systems  per  year  in  2011,  much  of  them  in 
India�  Biomass-based  power  systems  are  promoted 
inter  alia  where  a  handful  of  companies  are  installing 
them�  One  company,  Husk  Power  Systems,  started  in 
2007,  operated  around  80  rice  husk-based  mini-grids 
in 2013: their capacity ranged from 32-100 kW and they 
provided  electricity  to  over  200 000  people  across 
300 villages and hamlets�
Bringing electrification to more than 90% of India’s rural 
population would require USD 90 billion -190 billion in 
total  investment  between  2010  and  2030,  mainly  in 
transmission grids (Daioglou, V�, et al�, 2012)� Mini-grid 
and  off-grid  systems  offer  an  important  alternative 
for  reducing  these  investments,  and  India  is  already  a 
leading country for off-grid systems�
Off-grid  systems  play  an  increasingly  important  role 
in  rural  electrification  in  India�  Mini-grids  are  seen  as 
stepping stones towards centralised grid extension� The 
Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) is the 
main policy initiative promoting solar energy, including 
off-grid power development, but there are several other 
programmes for other renewable energy technologies�
Some  40%  of  the  power  required  by  India’s  740 000 
telecom base stations – averaging 3-5 kilowatt electrical 
(kWe) each and requiring 2-4 GW of capacity in total – 
comes  from  the  grid,  the  rest  from  diesel  generators� 
The  government  mandated  that  half  of  rural  sites  be 
Box 2: Renewable energy manufacturing in India
India’s National Manufacturing Policy seeks to increase the contribution of manufacturing to 25% of GDP with 
a focus on ‘greener and cleaner’ technologies� The policy recommends that a green manufacturing committee 
apply objective criteria to identify such technologies, consistent with the National Action Plan on Climate 
Change (NAPCC)� Yet, the Indian wind and solar manufacturing industries have seen significant fluctuations 
in the last decade� Once highly competitive, the solar sector has recently been unable to compete in the global 
market both on price and quality� This has led to a decline in exports and an increasing presence of foreign 
manufactured products in domestic installations�
Indian  wind  manufacturers  are  still  able  to  meet  domestic  expectations�  Both  industries  have  had  to  rely 
largely  on  their  overseas  suppliers  and  collaborators�  Indian  manufacturers  suggest  that  the  high  cost  of 
finance, lack of working capital and an insufficient credit line also put them at a disadvantage� It has been 
noticed that – while the Indian wind sector is the more competitive of the two as a result of maturity over 
time – its solar counterpart has been propped up by the demand created by the MNRE’s proposed minimum 
Domestic Content Requirement for all solar projects�
Domestic  module  manufacturing  capacity  stood  at  approximately  2�3  GW  at  the  end  of  March  2014,  but 
only 0�9 GW of solar PV plants were installed in India that year, a significant portion of them using imported 
crystalline  silicon  (C-Si)  and  thin  film  modules�  At  the  time  domestic  PV  cell  production  capacity,  which 
amounted  to  approximately  1�2  GW,  was  close  to  overall  PV  installations  during  2014�  However  the  cell 
manufacturers  were  exposed  to  extremely  low  capacity  utilisation,  producing  around  250  MW  that  year, 
because module manufacturers could source imported PV cells on account of their lower costs
The  Chinese  and  other  growing  markets  were  supported  by  increased  local  deployment  of  renewables 
and  policies  that  promoted  research  and  development  (R&D)  and  expansion  of  domestic  manufacturing� 
These policies included co-ordination with state and local governments, providing low-cost finance, making 
2 1
significant  economies  of  scale  and  ensuring  the  availability  of  such  supporting  infrastructure  as  cheap 
electricity and domestic sourcing of components� Indian manufacturers, on the other hand, faced a number 
of challenges such as high interest rates, imported machinery, high electricity costs, slow technology upgrade, 
and high lead times�
The  domestic  content  requirement  imposed  to  promote  solar  manufacturing  has  been  controversial  and 
widely debated, and has failed to be effective� One reason is that it favoured local manufacturing for crystalline 
silicon-based cells and modules and not thin-film� Secondly, the policy was focused on manufacturing rather 
than adding value� This meant that the focus was merely on making cells and modules, inadvertently ignoring 
the large value-creation opportunities further upstream and in the balance of the projects’ systems� Thirdly, 
it ran the risk of attracting trade disputes from countries that considered such a policy to be in violation of 
World Trade Organization rules: the resulting global surge of trade disputes has created further uncertainty 
in an already fragile market� And finally, the policy was bypassed by other countries using their donor and 
export credit agencies to finance installations that used thin-film technology� Besides creating distortions, this 
created a false sense of financial comfort among developers while failing to prepare the domestic financial 
sector to take on a greater burden of financing solar projects in subsequent phases�
The  domestic  content  requirement  provisions  were  modified  in  the  second  phase  of  the  National  Solar 
Mission� They became technology-neutral but applied to only 375 MW of the 750 MW central government 
procurement  of  solar  power  in  the  first  round  of  bidding�  Subsequently,  the  GOI  committed  to  providing 
financial support up to approximately USD 167/kW to central government public sector units for setting up 
large  scale  solar  capacities  with  domestically  manufactured  panels  (at  around  10-15%  of  the  installation’s 
costs)� The government has termed this scheme ‘World Trade Organization compliant’�
Nineteen firms in India manufacture wind turbines in the 225 kW to 2 500 kW range� Indian manufacturing 
– representing a capacity of over 9�5 GW – caters to both domestic and global markets, providing systems 
to the US and countries in the Middle East, South Asia, Africa and Latin America� As average wind turbine 
size increases worldwide, Indian manufacturers are losing their share of the global export market� Once a 
large  player,  their  export  share  of  12%  in  2008,  has  since  been  on  the  decline�  With  the  exception  of  one 
manufacturing company, no other wind or solar manufacturer has any exports from its Indian manufacturing 
base�
powered by renewables by 2015� By 2020, 75% of rural 
and 33% of urban stations will need to run on alternative 
energy  (Scientific  American,  2013)�  In  2013,  9 000 
telecom  based  stations  were  operating  on  renewable 
electricity,  and  India  installed  1 417  wind  water  pumps 
that year (IRENA, 2015a)�
its  total  ethanol  production  is  about  2�2  billion 
litres,  with  the  end-products  of  the  spirits  industry 
representing  three-quarters  (USDA,  2015)�  Its  total 
fuel  ethanol  production  ranks  third  among  Asian 
countries,  after  China  and  Thailand�  India  is  also  the 
world’s  second  largest  sugar  cane  producer,  and 
sugarcane  molasses  is  the  main  raw  material  for  its 
ethanol production (USDA, 2014)� Meanwhile, national 
biodiesel production reached 135 million litres in 2015 
(USDA, 2015)� Typically, vegetable oil, animal fats and 
used cooking oils are used as feedstock for biodiesel 
production in India�
Transport sector
Global  fuel  ethanol  production  reached  97  billion 
litres  in  2015  (RFA,  2016),  of  which  India  produced 
about  800  million  litres  or  0�8%�  By  comparison,

The government planned to achieve an ethanol blending 
mandate to 10% in 2015, up from just under 5% today� 
Government-owned  petroleum  companies  –  known 
colloquially  as  oil  marketing  companies  (OMCs)  – 
procured  550  million  litres  of  ethanol  in  2014,  a  slight 
increase from 475 million in 2013� If the mandate increase 
succeeds,  production  could  reach  up  to  700  million 
litres (USDA, 2014)� However, the goal of achieving 5% 
blending was for 2013, and is only expect to be reached 
by the end of fiscal year 2016, so achieving 10% looks 
unlikely in the near future (Business Standard, 2016)�
potential  of  12�3  million�  Solar  heating,  cooling  and 
cooking  technologies  are  also  used  in  the  end-use 
sectors  and  there  were  about  70  concentrated  solar 
cooking  units,  and  680 669  box  type  and  25 185  dish 
type solar cookers in India� (MNRE, 2015a)�
In  2014,  total  installed  solar  water  heating  capacity 
reached  8�61  million  m2  (6  GW),  and  in  that  year, 
0�53 million m2 capacity was installed� This was higher 
than  the  target  of  0�5  million  m2,  but  lower  than  the 
achieved installations in previous years, which exceeded 
1  million  m2�  Eighty  percent  of  the  total  capacity  is 
installed in the residential sector, 14% in the commercial 
sector  and  6%  in  the  industry  sector  (MNRE,  2014b)� 
About  three-quarters  of  the  total  installed  capacity  is 
flat-plate  collectors,  the  other  quarter  is  made  up  of 
evacuated  tube  collectors  (ETC)�  Solar  water  heaters 
in  India  have  an  average  capacity  utilisation  factor  of 
approximately  14%�  The  result  is  total  generation  of 
about  7  TWh  per  year  of  solar  heat,  which  represents 
about  0�1%  of  the  building  sector’s  total  energy 
demand� Examples of the use of solar thermal in Indian 
industry  include  plants  in  such  large  energy-intensive 
industries  as  iron  and  steel  or  pulp  and  low-energy 
consuming  textile  or  food  plants�  In  2013,  there  were 
28 concentrated solar thermal plants in India for process 
heating: a new one was commissioned in October 2014 
with  a  total  concentrator  area  of  450  m2  to  provide 
process  heat  at  280  degrees  Celsius  (o  C)  for  a  drug 
processing company�
There is growing government interest, largely driven by 
air  pollution,  in  electrifying  transport�  It  has  allocated 
USD 12�5 million to accelerate the domestic production 
of  electric  and  hybrid  vehicles�  This,  combined  with 
renewable electricity, could result in increasing the share 
of renewable energy in the national mix�
In  early  2015,  a  memorandum  of  understanding  was 
signed in the Punjab for constructing the first cellulosic 
bioethanol  plant  in  India,  using  paddy  straw  as  a 
feedstock,  with  a  total  capacity  of  60 000  tonnes  per 
year  (75  million  litres)�  Using  this  straw  for  biofuel 
production  will  minimise  the  environmental  impact  of 
burning it (Hindustan Times, 2015b)�
Heating and cooling sectors
Bioenergy remains the main source of renewable energy 
in Indian buildings and industry, but the consistency and 
availability of data for the use of renewables in heating 
and cooling is mixed: data is not available for the most 
recent years�
Cooling  is  one  of  the  largest  energy  consuming 
applications in Indian industry, with a current demand 
of about 35 GW� It is traditionally provided by electric 
units, causing significant spikes in electricity demand on 
hot days� Increasingly these units could be powered by 
renewable sources such as wind and solar PV: electricity 
production  by  the  latter  generally  coincides  well  with 
cooling demand on hot days� Figure 11 gives an example 
of  how  cooling  demand  in  New  Delhi  can  result  in 
an  increased  electricity  load  of  around  1 600  MW  in 
summer compared to winter, and this effect is expected 
to increase as demand for cooling in cities rises� By 2013, 
however, there were fewer than five concentrated solar 
cooling units in India�
According  to  the  IEA  (2015a),  a  total  of  7�3  EJ  of 
solid  biomass  was  used  in  India  in  2012  –  6  EJ  in  the 
building  sector  and  1�3  EJ  in  the  industry  sector�  The 
bioenergy  used  in  the  residential  sector,  mainly  for 
cooking, is defined as a traditional use of biomass (see 
the  next  section  for  a  detailed  discussion)�  Bioenergy 
represented 55% of the total final energy demand of the 
industry and building sectors (excluding electricity use 
and the total energy demand of the agriculture sector)�
As  of  March  2013,  there  were  4�75  million  biogas  and 
manure plants in India, about one third of the estimated 
2 3

 Base year renewable energy 
situation
In  2014  the  shares  are  slightly  different  from  what 
they  were  in  2010,  which  is  partly  due  to  differences 
in  sources  for  statistics  and  energy  growth�  By  then  a 
larger share of the TFEC was consumed in the building 
sector, with 40% in the form of fossil fuels and biomass, 
and  6%  as  electricity�  This  shows  the  increasing  use 
of  electricity  as  electrification  increases�  Modern  fuels 
include  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG)�  The  share  of 
TFEC  consumed  in  industry  also  increases  from  37% 
to  41%  for  fuels,  and  3%  to  5%  for  electricity�  Both 
agriculture and transport saw a decline in their relative 
shares� The share of electricity in the TFEC was relatively 
low, so the consumption of renewable electricity adds 
relatively  little  to  the  renewable  energy  share  when 
expressed in TFEC�
Sector-level breakdown
The  REmap  analysis  base  year  is  2010�  India’s  total 
primary energy supply was then 29 EJ (excluding non-
energy use of around 1�3 EJ) (IEA, 2015a)�6 In terms of 
final energy, this translates to 17�4 EJ� The buildings and 
industry  sectors  accounted  for  41%  each  of  this  total, 
with 13% consumed by the transport sector and 5% by 
the agriculture sector (Figure 12)� Electricity accounted 
for 12% of the TFEC� Industry accounted for nearly half 
of  the  total  consumption,  with  one-third  consumed  in 
buildings  and  18%  by  the  agriculture  sector,  which  for 
example, requires power for irrigation pumps�
Modern  and  traditional  forms  of  renewable  energy 
accounted for 40% of the TFEC in 2010� Distinguishing 
between  the  amount  of  biomass  used  in  traditional 
versus  modern  forms  is  not  easy,  as  little  data  is 
available  about  whether  the  cookstoves  currently  in 
use  are  modern  or  traditional�  When  traditional  uses 
of  bioenergy  are  excluded  from  the  mix,  modern 
renewables account for 16% of TFEC (IEA, 2015a)�
This  TFEC  breakdown  has  changed  in  the  past  three 
decades  (IEA,  2015a)�  In  the  1980s  building  energy 
demand  accounted  for  more  than  60%,  the  industry 
sector’s share was about 25%, and transport had a share 
of around 10%�
6  Primary  energy  supply  refers  to  the  direct  use  or  supply  of  all 
energy  carriers  (e.g.  crude  oil)  without  their  being  converted  or 
transformed to another form of energy (e.g. heat)� It is therefore 
higher than TFEC, which only looks at the consumption of energy 
carriers  such  as  fuels  for  the  transport  sector  or  electricity  for 
appliances (see footnote 1)�
Excluding the use of electricity, the share of renewable 
energy in India’s building sector was 84%� This is because 
of the significant volume of traditional biomass used for 
cooking:  when  this  is  not  counted  as  renewables,  the

renewable  energy  shares  drop  to  4%�  By  comparison, 
renewable  energy  use  is  20%  in  the  industry  sector, 
as  a  result  of  various  forms  of  gasifier,  residue  boiler 
and other specific applications (e�g� in small-scale steel 
mills)� Its share in transport is negligible,7 but 13% of total 
electricity generation was renewable in 2010�
is  related  to  heating,  ventilation  and  air  conditioning 
(HVAC) systems (GOI, 2014b)� India has the largest air 
conditioning demand worldwide, accordingto Davis and 
Gertler (2015), with an average of 3 120 cooling degree 
days8 (Pune, for example, has 2 485 cooling degree days, 
Mumbai  has  3 567)  (GBPN,  2014)�  Its  total  potential 
cooling demand is more than 12 times higher than that 
of  the  US�  However,  as  in  other  low-income  countries, 
the use of air conditioning is still limited� The same study 
also  shows  that  household  income  and  space  cooling 
adoption are closely related, especially in warmer areas: 
ownership levels increase by 2�7 percentage points per 
USD  1 000  increase  in  annual  household  income�  So 
demand for cooling – and the installation of equipment 
to meet it – can be expected to increase significantly in 
the next few decades�
India is leading in renewables for industrial 
applications, but somewhat lagging in the 
power and building sectors
The  building  and  industry  sectors  are  equally  the 
largest  energy  users  in  India,  each  accounting  for 
41%  of  its  TFEC�  Cooking  accounts  for  the  majority  of 
total  energy  demand  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas� 
Electricity  demand  has  been  growing  at  annual  rates 
reaching  more  than  10%  in  the  past  decade�  In  2010, 
India’s  building  sector  consumed  236  TWh  electricity, 
of  which  72%  was  in  the  residential  sector  and  28% 
in  the  commercial  sector�  Fans  (34%),  lighting  (28%) 
and  refrigeration  (13%)  account  for  three-quarters  of 
total  power  demand  in  the  residential  sector,  while  in 
commercial  buildings  55%  of  the  total  power  demand 
India’s grid faces its peak at around 7 p�m�, and cooling 
has  a  significant  impact�  Peak  load  in  New  Delhi,  for 
example, is between 3-4 GW in summer and 1�3-3�2 GW 
in winter� Cooling demand is 40-60% of summer peak 
load  (Shah,  Wei  and  Phadke,  2015),  and  this  peak  will 
grow� The room air conditioner (AC) market has grown 
from one million in 2003 to 3�5 million in 2012, with split 
units accounting for three-quarters of the total� In 2010 
7  The  renewable  energy  share,  excluding  power  and  district  heat 
demand,  provides  the  contribution  of  renewable  technologies  in 
the sector’s total fuel use only� This is important to know to exclude 
the effect of renewable power and district heating, which are often 
outside the boundaries of end-use sectors�
8  Degree-day is a measure of heating or cooling, which is the integral 
of a function of time that varies with temperature�
2 5
AC use in urban households reached the low saturation 
level  of  3%�  AC  demand  in  India  has  been  growing  at 
around  20%  per  year  in  the  past  decade�  Estimates 
show  that  related  electricity  demand  could  reach 
239  TWh/yr  by  2030�  That  would  translate  to  a  peak 
demand  contribution  of  about  143  GW,  or  an  increase 
in  units  from  around  3�5  million  to  116  million�  Three 
hundred new coal-fired power plants of 500 MW each 
would be needed to power them� By contrast, there is 
a potential to reduce the demand by 40% with efficient 
ACs: these could reduce the need for 100 new coal-fired 
power  plants,  and  have  a  peak-saving  potential  of 
60 GW (Phadke, Abhyankar and Shah, 2014)�
in  the  congested  western  and  eastern  parts  of  the 
country� Improvement in the rail sector, which will shift 
freight  traffic  from  roads  to  rail,  and  is  one  of  the  key 
determinants  of  energy  use  in  transport:  efforts  are 
ongoing, but are likely to take a long time�
Car  ownership  in  major  cities  ranged  from  as  low  as 
10  cars  per  1 000  people  in  Aurangabad  to  as  high  as 
175  cars  per  1 000  in  New  Delhi�  Two-wheelers  made 
up  75%  of  on-road  passenger  vehicles  in  2011�  Buses 
accounted  for  75%  of  the  total  road-based  passenger 
activity�  They  are  also  responsible  for  half  of  the  total 
road  passenger  vehicle  energy  use,  followed  by  cars/
jeeps and two wheelers, which each account for 19% of 
energy  demand  (The  Energy  and  Resources  Institute 
(TERI), 2015)�
Air conditioning demand growth has 
averaged 20% over the past ten years, and 
by 2030 the number of AC units is expected 
to increase from around 3.5 million today to 
116 million
Coal has played an important role in the Indian energy 
industry�  It  made  up  42%  of  the  total  primary  energy 
supply in 2010 and 70% of it was used for  generating 
electricity, accounting for two-thirds of the total power 
generation of 960 TWh/yr� Generation from natural gas 
was 12% of the total, while and nuclear and oil products 
each accounted for 3%�
India’s  industrial  energy  demand  has  been  growing 
fast� Large shares of it come both from bulk materials 
production – such as cement, steel and textile fibres – 
and  from  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  that 
produce various goods from food products to textiles: 
indeed,  much  of  India’s  bulk  material  production  is 
from small-scale sectors� (The United Nations Industrial 
Development Organization, (UNIDO) says there are 388 
energy-intensive  SMEs  manufacturing  clusters)�  There 
are also about 13 million micro, small and medium-size 
enterprises (MSME) in India contributing about 45% of 
its total manufacturing output, and 40% of its exports� 
Nearly  70  million  people  were  directly  and  indirectly 
employed in SMEs (Kumar, 2012)�
Hydropower accounted for 70% of total 
renewable electricity generation in 2010
Current  issues  faced  by  the  Indian  power  sector 
include: capacity shortages in the order of 15% of peak 
power  demand  and  10%  of  total  demand,  with  about 
75%  of  all  households  being  connected  to  the  grid; 
regular  blackouts;  structural  under-investment;  and 
market  and  institutional  failures�  Besides,  the  average 
electricity  price  covers  only  a  limited  share  of  the 
average  production  cost�  As  a  result,  power  is  not 
used efficiently, and is being wasted – especially in the 
agriculture sector, where electricity is used excessively� 
Furthermore, the conversion efficiency of Indian power 
plants  is  quite  low:  the  average  gross  efficiency  of 
thermal  power  plants  is  about  30%  or  even  less  – 
according  to  a  time  series  analysis  of  the  1990-2011 
period  (Hussey  et  al�,  2014)  –  thanks  to  the  high  ash 
content of India’s coal� The average age of the existing 
coal-based power plant stock is 13 years, and larger new 
coal  power  plant  capacity  is  being  rapidly  added:  the 
average capacity of the plants added in 2014 was 500 
MW� These include an increasing number  of new ultra 
large coastal power plants burning imported coal with 
lower  ash  content  and  higher  conversion  efficiencies� 
 
In 2010, more than 90% of the transport sector’s energy 
use  was  related  to  road  transport,  with  6%  related  to 
railways�  85%  of  its  passenger  activity  was  related  to 
road  transport  with  buses  and  omnibuses  making  up 
three-quarters of this total� The share of cars was low, 
at approximately 10%� The remaining passenger activity 
was largely related to rail transport, with aviation’s share 
remaining  less  than  1%  of  the  total�  Meanwhile  road 
accounted for 58% of freight transport, with rail taking 
the remaining 42%�
Every year India’s railways transport 927 million tonnes 
of freight and every day they carry 21 million passengers� 
is  expanding  railway  systems

Still,  the  average  conversion  efficiency  of  coal-based 
power generation is much lower than in other countries�
(based on the 2011 Indian census) mention that between 
two-thirds  and  70%  of  all  households  use  traditional 
biomass�
Traditional uses of biomass
Three-quarters  of  rural,  and  approximately  20%  of  all 
urban, homes in India use biomass fuel (Fernandes and 
Mesquita,  2014)�  The  conversion  to  modern  fuels  has 
been  relatively  high  in  urban  areas:  two-thirds  of  the 
urban  households,  according  to  the  2011  census,  used 
LPG for cooking: just 3% relied on crop residue and cow 
dung  cake�  By  contrast,  86%  of  rural  households  use 
firewood, cow dung cake and crop residues�
The  largest  populations  relying  on  the  traditional  use 
of  biomass  for  cooking  are  found  in  the  developing 
regions  of  Asia:  by  far  the  largest  number  of  these 
people  live  in  India�  The  total  population  relying  on 
traditional  biomass  ranges  from  700  million  to  more 
than  800  million  (IRENA,  2013a)�9  Using  biomass  for 
cooking  is  inconvenient,  and  procuring  the  fuel  takes 
time and effort – while its use in traditional cookstoves 
imposes severe ill effects on health� Women spend up 
to 7-8 hours per day in cooking, with 20% of that time 
devoted  collecting  fuel�  Four  hundred  million  Indians 
(90%  of  them  women)  are  exposed  to  respiratory, 
pulmonary and vision problems associated with indoor 
air pollution from burning biomass� The pollution causes 
875 000 deaths – and 16�9 million Disability Adjusted Life 
Years (DALYs), a measurement of overall disease burden 
– in India each year� About 525 000 of the total fatalities 
can be attributed to acute lower respiratory infections, 
the other 350 000 to chronic pulmonary diseases� One 
hundred  and  forty  thousand  children  under  the  age 
of  five  die  each  year  from  indoor  air  pollution  related 
diseases  (Dalberg,  2013)�  Advanced  biomass  cooking 
stoves  (or  other  options  with  clean  fuels)  can  avoid 
570 000  premature  deaths  in  India  –  as  well  as  4%  of 
India’s  total  annual  GHG  emissions  (Venkataraman  et 
al�, 2010)� It is vitally important to obtain current, robust 
energy statistics for the traditional use of biomass and 
then  identify  realistic  potential  for  substitution�  There 
is a particular need for modern cook stove initiatives in 
Central and South India, where the scale and intensity of 
solid fuel use for cooking is high (Dalberg, 2013)�
India has the world’s highest bovine population, which 
produces significant amounts of dung (Ravindranath and 
Balachandra, 2009)� Wood and crop residues are other 
typical biomass feedstocks (Mukhopadhyay et al�, 2012)� 
According  to  the  IEA  (2015a),  biomass  accounted  for 
around 8 EJ, or a quarter of India’s total primary energy 
supply  of  31�4  EJ  per  year  in  2011�  Eighty  percent  of 
this  biomass  use  was  in  the  residential  sector�  In  the 
absence  of  detailed  information,  the  IEA  defines  this 
as  traditional  uses  of  biomass  burned  in  inefficient 
cookstoves  or  on  open  fires  mainly  for  cooking,  but 
also  for  water  and  space  heating�  In  most  cases,  such 
biomass is unsustainably sourced�
The main challenges now being faced by the residential 
sector  are  access  to,  and  the  availability  of,  energy 
sources  and  the  efficient  use  of  energy  (TERI,  2015)� 
Average  per  capita  expenditure  on  cooking  fuels  has 
been  increasing,  on  average,  by  9%  per  year,  in  both 
rural and urban areas� Cookstoves need to have region-
specific characteristics to meet needs (Dalberg, 2013)� 
Depending on cooking habits, India can be classified into 
five broad food zones which determine heat density, the 
equipment required and key cooking activities�
Available  data  for  traditional  biomass  use  in  India  is 
mixed�  About  60-70%  of  the  total  population  relied 
on  solid  fuels  for  cooking  in  2010,  and  ten  states 
account  for  three-quarters  of  the  total  solid  fuel  use 
in  India  (Dalberg,  2013)�  Three-quarters,  or  at  least 
700  million  people,  rely  on  biomass  for  cooking  and 
heating (Fernandes and Mesquita, 2014)� Other surveys 
A modern cook stove programme was started in India in 
the mid-1980s and reached a peak dissemination rate of 
about 2�9 million stoves a year in the mid-1990s� By 2003, 
55�2 million modern cookstoves had been disseminated, 
mainly  to  rural  households�  Some  restaurants,  hotels 
and other businesses used biogasifier cookstoves that 
were as efficient as any cookstove� There are also biogas 
plants,  which  burn  a  mixture  of  methane  and  carbon 
dioxide�  Biogas,  as  a  modern  form  of  biomass,  offers 
socio-economic  and  environmental  benefits  (Minde, 
Magdum and Kalyanraman, 2013) and by 2006, nearly 
4  million  biogas  plants  had  been  built  for  cooking  in 
9 
In  2011,  the  total  population  of  India  reached  1 190  million  – 
834  million  living  in  rural  areas�  In  the  same  year,  the  urban 
population was 358 million� There are 167 million rural households 
and  79  million  urban  ones�  This  translates  to  5  and  4�5  people 
per  household  in  rural  and  urban  areas  of  India,  respectively 
(Census Info India)�
2 7
households  (Ravindranath  and  Balachandra,  2009)� 
Comments by Indian officials, however, have pointed to 
only 2 million biogas plants -around half – still being in 
operation in 2014� A recent announcement by software 
giant  Infosys,  which  plans  to  build  over  7 500  units  in 
the  Ramanagara  district  of  Karnataka  over  a  10-year 
period, shows that the potential of biogas is starting to 
be recognised (Economic Times, 2016a)�
need total energy of some 34 GJ� Total energy demand 
for cooking is lower in urban areas at 3�5 GJ per capita or 
some 16 GJ per household of five� Useful cooking energy 
demand, however, is between 1�7 and 2�7 GJ per capita 
so the efficiency of cooking is 25-40% in rural areas and 
50-75% in urban ones (van Ruijven et al�, 2011)�
Based on these capita demand values, the total energy 
demand  for  cooking  in  2010  would  be  approximately 
7 EJ� That would require 4�6-5�2 EJ of traditional uses of 
biomass in 2011, assuming that 66-75% of all households 
require it (Daioglou, van Ruijven and van Vuuren, 2012)� 
That, in turn, is 80-90% of the reported total use of solid 
biomass use in the residential sector according to IEA 
energy balances (2015a); hence around 10-20% of total 
solid biomass use would be in modern forms� Traditional 
uses of biomass would be equivalent to 4-5 EJ in 2010� 
This report assumes the lower end of this range for the 
year 2010�
There  is  only  a  marginal  difference  between  solid  fuel 
(firewood,  charcoal)  and  modern  fuel  prices,  with 
solid  fuels  being  slightly  more  expensive�  However, 
the  cost  savings  are  significant  when  the  benefits  of 
modern  fuels  are  included  (Dalberg,  2013)�  Biogas 
cookstoves are the most cost-competitive of all modern 
and  traditional  uses  of  fuels,  with  levelised  costs  for 
household  and  community-scale  ones  between  600-
900 INR/GJ according to the CEEW (2015b)� Firewood 
and LPG-based cookstoves generate heat slightly more 
expensively, at between 1 000-1 150 INR/GJ� Electric and 
induction stoves are more expensive still, with costs in 
the  range  of  1 550-1 650  INR/GJ�  Clearly  biogas-based 
cookstoves are cheaper and, in view of the availability of 
the resource, offer considerable potential in substituting 
traditional uses of biomass�
Heating and transport sectors
Most  of  the  use  of  renewable  energy  in  heating  and 
transport  is  made  up  of  biomass  for  cooking�  Next 
in  importance  are  solar  water  heaters  in  domestic 
and  industrial  processes�  Their  installed  capacity  in 
residential  buildings  reached  2 790  MW  in  2010 
(about  4  million  m2)  –  mostly  as  flat-plate  collectors 
(2 413  MW;  AEE-Intec,  2012),  representing  about 
810 000 systems� India, with new capacity of 622 MW, 
ranked fourth in annual installations worldwide in 2010, 
after China, Turkey and Germany, and capacity factors 
reaching 14%� The yield from solar thermal has reached 
3�4 TWh per year, or 0�2% of the Indian building sector’s 
Biogas offers socio-economic and 
environmental benefits, and is a modern 
and clean alternative to traditional 
cookstoves with great potential
Per capita energy demand for cooking – based on 2004 
values (Shukla, 2004) – is approximately 6�7 GJ in rural 
areas, meaning that a household of five people, would 
Box 3: LPG use and the role of subsidies
Domestic Indian consumption of LPG has grown strongly, with almost 45 million new connections installed 
between 2010 and 2013� However, the 2011 Census showed that only 70 million households out of the 110 
million with connections use LPG as their primary cooking fuel� The subsidy for supporting this growth in 
LPG use stood at approximately USD 8 billion in the financial year 2013/14, but a study of who benefits from it 
shows that 50% of it goes to the top 30% of the population while the bottom 30% get only 15% (CEEW, 2014)� 
With more than 70% of LPG distribution channels located in urban areas, about 50% of the urban population 
use LPG as their sole cooking fuel, as opposed to just 6% of rural people: yet 68% of the population lives in 
rural areas� While urban consumption of LPG and compressed natural gas for cooking has been growing, 
the  use  of  electric  kettles,  electric  water  heaters,  and  induction  stoves  based  on  electricity  has  also  been 
increasing�  If  gas  subsidies  are  withdrawn,  there  may  be  a  tendency  to  shift  to  using  electricity  in  urban 
households, given the availability of such electrical products in an ever-increasing consumer market�
2 8
total fuel demand� For comparison, energy demand for 
water heating in India from all sources is about 1-2% of 
the building sector total (GBPN, 2014)�
power deficit, and businesses are put at a competitive 
disadvantage as a result of their need to pay for batteries 
and diesel generators for back-up power (Federation of 
Indian  Chambers  of  Commerce  and  industry  (FICCI), 
2013)�
Residential  buildings  represent  more  than  90%  of  the 
total  installed  capacity  of  solar  water  heaters  in  India: 
the  remainder  is  in  applications  in  the  industrial  and 
commercial  sectors,  which  made  up  approximately 
30 000  m2  of  collector  area  representing  more  than 
150 systems, including process heat� India’s Arun dish-
type installations provide process heat at temperatures 
around  120o  C�  Paraboloid  dish  systems  in  a  drug 
manufacturing  company  generate  heat  at  280o  C� 
Several  other  similar  technologies  are  used  in  the 
country’s manufacturing industry�
Todays’  grid  infrastructure  challenges  stem  from  the 
high  growth  rates  in  electricity  consumption  by  both 
industry and residents� The total length of transmission 
and  distribution  lines  grew  by  just  50%  in  2002-2013 
period,  while  total  electricity  demand  doubled�  Over 
the  longer  term,  peak  load  is  expected  to  increase  to 
283  GW  by  2022  and  more  than  600  GW  by  2034 
(CEA,  2015)�  The  lag  in  transmission  and  distribution 
infrastructure is partly due to land acquisition or Right-
Of-Way  (ROW)  issues,  which  led  to  more  than  120 
transmission projects facing delays in 2011 (FICCI, 2013)�
There  were  some  120  Indian  distilleries  in  2010  with 
a  capacity  to  produce  1�8  billion  litres  of  conventional 
ethanol  production  per  year  to  meet  the  demand 
generated  by  5%  blending  with  petrol�  Its  production 
is  mainly  from  sugar  molasses:  advanced  bioethanol 
production  is  only  in  the  R&D  phase�  Production  of 
biodiesel  (from  jatropha)  was  small,  at  just  140-300 
million  litres  per  year:  it  is  mainly  used  to  replace 
replacement  diesel  in  power  generation  and  heating, 
instead of as a transport fuel (USDA, 2011)�
Relieving  grid  congestion  and  improving  the  power 
grid  infrastructure  is  a  main  priority  for  the  central 
government, which will need to work with a variety of 
actors  to  achieve  its  aims  (see  Figure  13)�  The  “green 
corridors”  programme,  which  will  allow  electricity 
produced from renewables to be fed into the public grid, 
is  one  effort  to  address  this  issue  while  enabling  the 
scale-up of renewable energy� Funding is being sourced 
for  constructing  transmission  lines  from  international 
development  banks,  including  KfW,  the  Germany’s 
Development  Bank,  which  recently  concluded  a 
USD 1�1 billion loan agreement to expand the grid with 
an Indian power transmission company (KfW, 2014)�
3�4  Transmission and 
distribution grids
Reliable, affordable and secure electricity production is 
essential in ensuring the continued growth of industrial 
and  commercial  activities  and  in  satisfying  residents’ 
rising  demands�  However,  India’s  grid  infrastructure  is 
already  strained  and  in  need  of  major  improvements� 
Its transmission and distribution losses are among the 
highest in the world, averaging 26% of total electricity 
generation,  and  rising  as  high  as  62%  in  some  states� 
When  such  non-technical  losses  as  energy  theft  are 
included,  total  average  losses  are  as  high  as  50%� 
Billing  efficiency  is  55%  and  collection  efficiency  only 
41%�  Power  producers  lose  money  as  a  result�  Losses 
in distribution power lines also depend on the system’s 
geographical spread: in extreme cases, such as in rural 
India,  these  may  exceed  30%,  even  45%  during  peak 
load periods�
The  existing  Indian  Power  system  is  divided  into  five 
regional  grids  (Northern,  Southern,  Eastern,  North-
eastern,  and  Western)�  By  the  end  of  2013,  all  these 
grids  had  been  interconnected  through  high-voltage 
transmission  lines,  but  inter-regional  transmission 
capacity is relatively low compared to installed capacity: 
in 2012, India had around 200 GW of power generation, 
but only 25 GW of inter-regional transmission capacity 
(Lall,  2012)�  In  July  2014,  total  transmission  capacity 
reached  250  GW  (MoP,  2014a)  and  inter-regional 
transmission  capacity  is  expected  to  reach  around 
65 GW in 2017 (PGCIL, 2012), by which time renewable 
energy  capacity  (excluding  hydropower)  is  estimated 
to  be  83  GW  (MoP,  2014a)�  An  estimated  135  GW 
of  non-hydropower  renewable  generation  is  expected 
in  2022  by  which  time  the  Northern  and  Southern 
regions are expected to experience deficits up to 20 GW 
(MoP, 2014a)�
Power  shortages  resulted  in  a  0�4%  loss  of  GDP  in 
2012/13�  Load-shedding  is  common  due  to  the  peak

Meanwhile, India is diversifying its power generation mix 
through  growth  in  biomass-based  power  generation, 
CSP, wind power and solar photovoltaics� A Renewable 
Energy Purchase Obligation (RPO) has been introduced, 
requiring power distribution companies to buy 5-10% of 
their electricity from renewable sources, or to purchase 
renewable energy certificates (REC)� Each REC, which 
can  be  traded  across  the  various  States,  stands  for  1 
MWh  of  renewable  power  generation,  and  there  is  a 
separate market for Solar Renewable Energy Certificates 
(SREC)� By 2014, some 15 million RECs had been issued: 
more  than  six  million  RECs  had  been  traded  since 
the  implementation  of  the  REC  mechanism,  whose 
nodal  agency  is  the  National  Load  Despatch  Centre� 
Additionally, the Indian Energy Exchange that has been 
in  operation  since  2009,  offers  day-ahead  and  longer 
term markets for power providers, supplying around 5% 
of the country’s electricity consumption� It also operates 
a Renewable Energy Certificate Market where RECs can 
be bought and sold�
Following the National Solar Mission, and the continued 
expansion of wind power, the Indian Government asked 
the  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  (POWERGRID) 
in  2012  to  assess  the  transmission  infrastructure  and 
control  equipment  needed  to  achieve  the  added 
renewable  power  generation  capacity  outlined  in  the 
12th  plan�  The  result  envisioned  164  GW  of  wind  and 
35  GW  of  solar  in  2030�  The  so-called  “Green  Energy 
Corridor”  report  found  that  additional  Intra-State 
Transmission  networks  would  be  required  to  facilitate 
transfer  of  renewable  power  from  states10  rich  in  it  to 
10  Renewable energy rich States examined were Tamil Nadu, Andhra 
Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Himachal 
Pradesh�

others�  It  added  that  smart  grid  technologies  –  like 
forecasting  methods,  STATCOMs,  synchrophasors, 
dynamic  compensators  and  switchable/controlled  bus 
reactors  –  would  be  required  to  maintain  frequency 
and  voltage,  while  renewable  energy  management 
centres would need to be established to exchange data 
and  models  to  support  the  integration  of  renewables� 
The  Indian  Electricity  Grid  Code  is  the  right  venue  for 
addressing such topics as low voltage ride-through – to 
provisions, voltage and reactive power (VAR) support, 
frequency  and  inertial  response  support,  and  reserves 
response (NITI Aayog, 2015)� The Central Transmission 
Utility (CTU), the CEA, and the Power System Operation 
Corporation  were  identified  as  key  stakeholders  to 
examine  the  role  of  energy  storage  for  renewable 
energy grid integration� Table 1 provides an overview of 
the  estimated  costs  associated  with  different  options 
for integrating renewable power generation (Power Grid 
Corporation, 2012)�
of renewable energy would be needed to deal with the 
power  surplus�  On  the  policy  and  regulatory  side,  its 
report recommended exploring energy storage options 
in more detail (TERI, 2015)�
Since  then,  the  CEA  has  introduced  connectivity 
standards for wind and solar PV generation plants with 
requirements  for  harmonics,  direct  current  injections, 
flicker,  fault-ride  through,  reactive  power  support,  as 
well as active power injection for those wind generation 
stations  connected  at  higher  voltage  levels  (>66  kV) 
(CEA, 2013)�
The CEA has also been examining additional strategies 
for  integrating  large  scale  renewable  power  projects 
and  has  suggested  that  states  should  set  their 
renewable  power  purchase  obligations  according  to 
their  capacity  to  balance  the  combined  variability  of 
load  and  renewable  power  generation�  States  should 
examine technical and regulatory measures to enhance 
the  flexibility  of  conventional  generation  to  increase 
balancing  capacity,  and  seek  co-operation  with  the 
renewable  energy  management  centres  in  renewable-
rich  states  to  make  optimal  use  of  transmission

Similar  studies  have  been  conducted  at  state  level� 
The  State  of  Gujarat,  for  example,  assessed  the  policy 
and  regulatory  challenges  needed  to  integrate  up  to 
10  GW  of  solar  PV  and  35  GW  of  wind  power  into  its

Box 4: Telecom towers in India
The Indian telecom industry has grown at an annual rate of 28% in the last five years and the country now has 
about 740 000 mobile telephone towers – 60% of them in rural areas� Another 200 000 towers are expected 
by 2020� Rural areas are expected to drive telecom sector growth�
Of percentthe current towers, 70% have less than 16 hours of grid supply per day� Each consumes 6000 litres 
of  diesel  per  year  to  cover  the  remaining  8  hours  or  so  that  are  unsupplied�  In  all,  telecom  towers  are 
consuming 5�12 billion litres of diesel per year�
The Green Telecom directive aims to address this challenge, and mandates:
 ● Making telecom operators as of 2015 run at least 50% of all rural towers and 20% of the urban ones on 
hybrid power (renewables technology or grid power);
 ● Increasing clean energy implementation to 75% of rural towers, and 33% of urban towers by 2020; and
 ● Enforcing a directive in line with the Government’s priority of decreasing the fiscal deficit by cutting down 
the subsidy expenditure on diesel�
Various options exist for power supply to telecom towers, these include technologies such as:
grid + battery + distributed generation (DG);
grid + Solar PV + battery + DG; or
grid + Solar PV + battery + Fuel cell�
The cost of power for many of these systems would range between 20-40 INR/kWh (ICF, 2014)�

ambition  for  renewable  power  generation  since  the 
‘Green  Energy  Corridor’  report,  and  accelerated  its 
implementation (MNRE, 2014a)�
China  and  is  expected,  from  2020,  to  be  the  country 
most  driving  worldwide  demand  increases�  India  also 
imported 3�8 EJ of coal or 20% of its total consumption; 
it used 70% in power generation and 10% for steel and 
cement  production�  Demand  is  projected  to  double  in 
the next decade, with the structure of the coal market 
remaining similar, but coking coal and power generation 
accounting for growth according to the Working Group 
for Coal and Lignite in the 12th FYP)�
The  Ministry  of  Power  is  implementing  an  Integrated 
Power  Development  Scheme  (IPDS)  with  funds 
to  strengthen  sub-transmission  and  distribution 
networks  in  urban  areas,  to  meter  urban  distribution 
transformers/feeders/consumers,  and  to  provide  for 
the deployment of solar panels, and smart grids (MoP, 
2014a)�  Meanwhile  the  Deendayal  Upadhyaya  Gram 
Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) programme has been launched 
to  strengthen  sub-transmission  and  distribution 
networks,  including  metering,  in  rural  areas  (MoP, 
2014b) Furthermore, the Cabinet approved the North-
eastern  Region  Power  System  Improvement  Project 
(NERSPSIP) in November 2014 to strengthen the Intra 
State Transmission and Distribution System (Business 
Standard,  2014):  19  GW  of  additional  transmission 
capacity  is  under  construction,  with  another  21  GW 
expected to be built before 2018�
Demand  for  coal  is  expected  to  reach  1 300  Mt/yr 
(35  EJ)  by  2025,  with  15%  of  it  (200  Mt)  met  by 
imports�  Some  assessments  expect  this 
import 
volume  to  be  reached  as  early  as  2017  as  domestic 
production  is  not  likely  to  keep  up  with  growing 
demand (Krishnamoorthy, n�d�)� An energy system that 
increasingly  relies  on  coal  will  be  subject  to  energy 
security  risks�  Furthermore,  a  high  demand  for  coal, 
and more imports, will bring India a larger energy bill� 
The high ash content of the type of coal used in India 
poses  multiple  problems�  Its  calorific  value  is  typically 
low,  resulting  in  the  transport  of  large  volumes  and 
increased storage requirements� The efficiency of coal-
fired  power  plants  is  also  low  compared  to  the  world 
average� Renewables can help reduce both the growing 
dependency  on  importing  coal  and  reduce  problems 
related to its use�
Interconnector  capacity  with  neighbouring  countries 
will also play an important role in strengthening India’s 
grid  and  improving  reliability  and  load  factors  while 
accommodating  higher  shares  of  renewable  energy: 
several  neighbouring  South  Asian  countries  have 
abundant  natural  resources  and  operate  their  grids  in 
common frequencies and similar voltages�
In the Reference Case, India will consume 
one-third of global coal production in 2030
India  has  a  total  interconnector  capacity  of  1 416  MW 
with Bhutan, creating major possibilities for importing 
hydroelectricity� Another 1 200 MW capacity is planned, 
as  is  a  1 517  MW  interconnector  capacity  with  Nepal� 
There is also, an important opportunity to expand it to 
use Nepal’s hydropower potential� India has no installed 
interconnector capacity with Sri Lanka, but 1 500 MW is 
planned for the future (NEA, n�d�)
India’s  crude  oil  production  has  reached  1�6  EJ,  and  it 
imports an additional 7�9 EJ� Annual production has been 
stagnant at 0�83 million barrels per day (mbd) over past 
years� The import dependency of crude oil and refinery 
throughput are 76% and 84�7%, respectively� Imports are 
expected  to  increase  by  50%  between  2012  and  2017 
according to the 12th FYP (Krishnamoorthy, n�d�)�
The  country’s  total  natural  gas  production  was  1�3  EJ, 
and it imported 0�3 EJ� The consumption of natural gas, 
including LNG, is growing the fastest of all fossil fuels, 
with demand increasing by 12% per year between 2007 
and  2012�  (Krishnamoorthy,  n�d�)�  Its  share  in  India’s 
total energy system is expected to reach 20% in 2025, 
up  from  11%  in  2010�  According  to  Natural  Gas  Vision 
2030,  demand  is  projected  to  more  than  triple  from 
242 million cubic metres per day in 2012 to 746 million 
by 2030� The fertiliser sector’s present 25% share could 
drop to 15% as a result of increasing demand from other 
3�5  Conventional fuel markets and 
short-term expectations
India both produces and imports fossil fuels� It has 10% 
of  global  coal  reserves,  the  5th  largest  of  any  country 
in  the  world  (Krishnamoorthy,  n�d�)�  They  are  mostly 
in  the  eastern  side  of  the  country,  which  is  important 
since it necessitates transport links to other regions� Its 
coal production reached 14 EJ (more than 550 million 
tonnes)  in  2012�  It  has  the  biggest  coal  demand  after 
3 2
sectors,  such  as  other  petrochemical  production  and 
city gas, but mainly from power production� Domestic 
sources  would  account  for  half  of  the  total  supply, 
with  LNG  (45%)  and  cross-border  pipelines  (5%;  e�g� 
from Turkmenistan and Trans-Afghanistan) accounting 
for  the  other  half  by  2030  (Petroleum  &  Natural  Gas 
Regulatory Board (PNGRB), 2013)�
gas  (MNRE,  2014b)�  Coal  will  remain  a  key  energy 
source  in  meeting  rapidly  expanding  power  needs 
despite the apparent water conflicts� India is a relatively 
water-scarce  country,  with  only  4%  of  the  world’s 
freshwater resources� Worldwide, about 1 200 new coal 
power  plants  are  being  proposed  representing  nearly 
1 000  GW  of  installed  capacity:  Three-quarters  of  the 
total number of plants planned are in China and India 
(Burt, Oris and Buchanan, 2013)� About one-third of the 
total capacity is in India�
The  US  Energy  Information  Administration  estimates, 
India has more than 250 trillion cubic feet of shale gas 
resources in four basins, equivalent to more than 1 000 
years  of  natural  gas  consumption  based  on  today’s 
level of demand� National oil companies are allowed to 
explore  and  exploit  such  unconventional  hydrocarbon 
resources  (Krishnamoorthy,  n�d�)�  India  also  has  an 
installed nuclear capacity of 5 GW, with a plan to reach 
60 GW by 2032 (Krishnamoorthy, n�d�)�
Seventy-nine  percent  of  India’s  new  energy  capacity 
is expected to be built in areas that already face water 
scarcity or water stress� The country plans, for example, 
to build a cluster of 71 coal plants in the Vidarbha region 
of  Central  Maharashtra,  a  highly  water-stressed  area 
where lack of water for irrigation has been documented 
over the last decade� The Ministry of Water Resources 
predicts that the national demand for water in energy 
production will increase 16-fold by 2050� According to a 
study by an Indian electricity regulator, the most water 
efficient technologies (dry cooling) reduce consumption 
by 90% but result in an 8-9% increase in the electricity 
tariff�
Increasing  demand  and  reduced  domestic  production 
is  causing  all  fossil  fuels  to  face  import  dependency 
in India� Crude oil has the highest share of imports, at 
three-quarters of total consumption in 2010� The share 
of  imports  of  natural  gas  and  coal  were  22%  and  13% 
of  total  consumption  in  2013�  A  recent  study  by  TERI 
(2015), concludes that the average import dependence 
of fossil fuels will increase from 40% in 2011 to 74% by 
2030/31  under  a  business  as  usual  scenario,  mainly 
driven by the tripling of dependency in both coal and 
natural gas� A scenario that prioritises energy security 
through  better  energy  efficiency  involves  switching 
toward  natural  gas  and  higher  shares  of  renewables� 
This can help to limit the growth in import dependency 
to only 44% at the same time period� Crude oil and coal 
dependencies would remain the same as now, though 
that of natural gas would triple�
Increasing the deployment of solar PV and wind turbines 
reduces  the  water-intensity  of  electricity  generation, 
and  a  recent  analysis  for  China  demonstrates  by  how 
much� It shows that a combination of improving plant 
cooling technologies and increasing renewables, based 
largely  on  Solar  PV  and  wind,  can  reduce  the  water-
intensity  of  Chinese  power  generation  by  as  much  as 
42%  by  2030  (IRENA  and  China  Water  Risk,  2016)� 
Though the study focused on China, its conclusions can 
generally be applied to other countries heavily reliant on 
coal for power generation, such as India�
In the next 15 years, deployment of 
renewables will be key to securing India’s 
energy supplies
There are about 26 million pumps in Indian agriculture� 
At  least  12  million  of  them  use  grid-based  electric 
motors and 10 million operate with diesel� The number 
of electric tube wells (pipes bored into the ground that 
pump water to the surface) has increased from 12 million 
in  2001  to  nearly  20  million  today�  Nearly  20%  of  all 
India’s power generation is used for agricultural water 
pumping�  When  rainfall  is  low,  water  stress  increases� 
India  spends  over  USD  6  billion  on  energy  subsidies 
annually,  and  farmers  pay  only  an  estimated  13%  of 
the true cost of electricity� With very low power prices, 
excess water use has even further impacts, especially on 
groundwater resources� India is the world’s largest user 
3�6  Nexus issues
The interlinkage between water, energy and food supply 
systems  is  a  major  consideration  in  India�  With  its 
growing population and economy, demands for all three 
are increasing equally fast�
The electricity mix in India is dominated by coal-based 
power  plants,  followed  by  hydropower  and  natural 
3 3
of  groundwater  for  agriculture:  it  accounts  for  nearly 
80% of all freshwater use� As groundwater levels drop, 
more power is needed to retrieve it, thus increasing the 
energy intensity of extraction (IRENA, 2015b)�
use, but it also is more capital and energy intensive, may 
not  be  suitable  for  all  irrigation  applications,  and  may 
reduce the replenishment of groundwater as a result of 
limited flow from seeps to aquifers�
During  2014/15,  the  Government  undertook  to  install 
100 000 solar water pumping stations for irrigation and 
drinking water� In 2015/16, 22 000 were installed (MNRE, 
2016a)� The Government has also recently announced a 
piped water supply programme deploying 20 000 solar 
pumps in select tribal and rural districts (IRENA, 2015b)� 
Replacing  five  million  diesel  pump  sets  with  solar 
systems could lead to savings of nearly 18�7 GW worth 
of  installed  capacity,  23�3  TWh  electricity,  10  billion 
litres of diesel and 26 Mt of CO2 emissions� Renewables 
offer an important alternative for agricultural pumping 
with  multiple  benefits  (IRENA,  2016c)�  The  benefits 
of  a  large-scale  deployment  of  solar  pumps  include 
expanding water services to underserved communities 
and  unirrigated  lands,  while  reducing  dependence 
on  grid  electricity  or  fossil  fuels�  They  also  help  to 
mitigate the local environmental impacts of using diesel, 
enhance overall grid stability in agrarian economies, and 
reduce the burden of electricity and fossil fuel subsidies� 
The  technology  is  mature  and  has  been  successfully 
deployed at scale�
The types of biofuel crops grown and their location in 
India,  also  makes  a  difference  to  overall  water  use�  A 
litre of ethanol made from irrigated sugarcane in India, 
for example, needs more than 25 times as much water 
as one made from mostly rain-fed sugarcane in Brazil� 
Approximately 93% of India’s sugarcane area is irrigated 
and there little availability of land for rain-fed sugarcane 
production�
In view of these resource constraints, sugar cane may 
have limited potential for large-scale biofuel production 
in  India�  Efforts  to  further  increase  its  area  and 
production would undoubtedly intensify already severe 
competition  for  land  and  scarce  water  resources�  An 
alternative  option,  technologically  similar  and  proven 
for the production of bio-ethanol, yet agro-ecologically 
much better suited to the Indian context, is producing 
ethanol from a feedstock of the stalks of sweet sorghum� 
Unlike  sugarcane,  sorghum  can  be  grown  with  good 
success  under  rain-fed  conditions  in  nearly  all  of  the 
country, is drought tolerant and is much less demanding 
on soils (IIASA, 2014)�
On the other hand, there is also evidence of risks posed 
by solar-based pumping� Since the operational cost of 
PV  pumps  is  negligible,  and  the  availability  of  energy 
is predictable, they could cause overdrawing of water� 
Many  solar  pumping  promotion  programmes  package 
financial support with the deployment of drip irrigation 
technology  so  as  to  mitigate  this  risk�  Drip  irrigation 
technology can indeed improve the efficiency of water 
Another interesting issue is how the use of biomass in 
rural areas impacts food productivity and whether it can 
improve India’s food security� Diverting cattle dung from 
farm  manure  to  household  cooking  fuel,  for  example, 
can reduce the amount of time spent on collecting and 
preparing traditional biomass fuel� Additional research 
is needed on nexus issues like these�

AND THE CURRENT POLICY 
FRAMEWORK
Key points
carried out by CEEW and the Natural Resources 
Defense  Council  (NRDC)  estimates  that  more 
than  one  million  full  time  equivalent  jobs  will 
be created between now and 2022 by the solar 
deployment  industry  alone�  Similarly,  the  wind 
sector would create 183 500 jobs by 2022, as its 
capacity  increases  to  60  GW�  The  job  creation 
potential  of  the  renewable  energy  sectors  is 
therefore  significant,  but  it  is  accompanied  by 
an urgent, and currently unmet, need for training 
and skill development�
 ●
India’s  widespread  energy  scarcity,  and  its 
vulnerability to energy price shocks, have led to 
a long history of initiatives to promote renewable 
energy� Also, reducing the environmental impacts 
of  using  fossil  fuels  and  climate  change  are 
increasingly main drivers of renewables in India�
 ●
installed 
India’s  recent  target  of  175  GW 
renewable  energy  capacity  is  indicative  of  its 
firm commitment to scaling renewables up� This 
ambitious target has led to much enthusiasm in 
the market, and recent efforts are bearing fruit – 
such as auctions for solar PV – but further efforts 
will be needed for its timely realisation�
India’s target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy 
capacity by 2022 was officially announced in the 2015 
budget  speech�  As  the  country  approaches  the  next 
budget  announcement,  the  country’s  total  installed 
renewable  energy  capacity  is  close  to  43  GW,  nearly 
25%  of  this  target  (MNRE,  2016b)�  Historically  India 
has  paid  much  attention  to  renewables  in  its  energy 
policy�  In  1992,  it  was  the  first  country  to  set  up  a 
ministry  dedicated  exclusively  to  renewable  and  new 
energy  sources  (previously  it  had  been  a  dedicated 
department,  which  started  operating  in  1982)�  Wind 
and  solar  technologies  have  been  promoted  through 
various policies and measures in the past two decades, 
if  with  mixed  success�  Figure  14  below  highlights  the 
timeline of the various policy measures adopted, along 
with  the  growth  of  the  country’s  renewable  energy 
capacity�
 ●
The drivers for renewables are different in India 
than  in  countries,  which  are  advanced  in  their 
use, such as the US and Germany, and even China� 
Some  of  India’s  socio-economic  characteristics 
are  unique�  Its  population,  income  levels  and, 
thus,  energy  demand  are  all  projected  to  grow 
faster  than  in  these  countries�  The  growing 
demand  will  need  to  be  met,  and  the  trend 
shows that fossil fuels will meet more of it than 
renewables�
 ●
India will be the world’s most populous country 
towards  the  end  of  this  decade�  By  2017/2018 
its population will equal China’s and by 2030 it 
will  be  18%  larger  than  at  present�  More  people 
will live in urban areas by then: some 610 million 
compared  to  today’s  415  million,  up  from  32% 
to  40%  of  the  population�  That  would  mean 
building nearly 200 new cities of a million people 
each� Most of India’s population, furthermore, is 
expected to be under the age of 30�
Despite  rapid  strides  in  adding  power  capacity,  India 
continues to be plagued by widespread energy poverty� 
A significant proportion of its population lacks access to 
clean and affordable energy� Estimates suggest that 80 
million households, with more than 300 million people, 
have  inadequate  access  to  electricity�  Advances  have 
been made in extending the electricity grid across the 
country,  but  extending  it  to  remote  and  rural  areas  is 
often economically prohibitive and faces the persistent 
problem  of  variable  supply�  Energy  access  is  pivotal 
for holistic human development and economic growth

applications�  Efforts  to  use  biogas  effectively  –  and 
to extend the reach of the electricity grid to evacuate 
power and distribute it to people in remote locations – 
are being undertaken� There has also been a big push for 
decentralised  energy  systems  powered  by  renewable 
energy in the last decade�
Renewable energy in India is seen as a 
supplement to energy supply from other 
traditional sources in meeting rapidly 
growing energy demand
India’s widespread energy scarcity – and 
its vulnerability to energy price shocks – 
have led to a long history of initiatives to 
promote renewable energy
India’s  energy  policy  is  primarily  focused  on  bridging 
ongoing  supply  and  demand  gaps,  while  bearing  in 
mind  the  advantages  from  transitioning  away  from 
a  mix  highly  reliant  on  fossil  fuels�  Despite  several 
pro-renewables  policies  in  place,  however,  the  share 
of  renewable  energy  has  fluctuated  between  13%  and 
19%  over  the  past  years  and  has  yet  to  make  a  dent 
in  the  share  of  electricity  generation  from  fossil  fuels� 
In  recent  years,  central  and  state  governments  have 
adopted  programmes  that  give  impetus  to  the  wind 
and  solar  markets,  including  non-electricity  driven 
India’s  growing  trend  of  policy  focus  on  renewables 
continues�  In  July  2015,  MNRE  released  the  draft 
National Renewable Energy Act (NREA), which specifies 
the need for large scale consumption of renewables� It 
also  mentions  that  increasing  the  share  of  renewable 
energy would require changes both in domestic energy 
policies and in the planning guidelines for India’s energy

Macroeconomic Drivers
system�  The  act  promotes  renewables  in  line  with 
climate, environmental and macroeconomic objectives 
and aims to reduce India’s import dependency on fossil 
fuels  and  GHG  emissions�  India  released  its  INDC  in 
October, 2015 with specific targets for deploying solar, 
wind  and  biomass  energy,  and  a  collective  target  of 
40% of power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources� In 
early 2016, the country also amended its National Tariff 
Policy  (NTP),  which  aims  to  promote  faster  adoption 
of  renewable  energy  and  sourcing  of  power  through 
competitive bidding�
Table  2  compares  a  number  of  socio-economic  and 
renewable energy indicators for India, China, Germany 
and the US to show how their different population and 
economic drivers affect energy demand� The table shows 
that India’s per capita income level is the lowest, but is 
expected to grow quickly� Around 20% of its population 
currently does not have access to electricity� Like China, 
it  has  a  large  share  of  traditional  biomass,  and  has 
experienced significant growth in energy demand over 
the  last  10  years�  The  table  shows  that  India  is  unique 
among  these  major  energy  consuming  economies  in 
some  of  its  socio-economic  characteristics,  as  well  as 
having different drivers than the US and Germany, and 
even China�11
4�1  Drivers of renewable energy 
in India
Drivers  for  renewable  energy  vary  from  country  to 
country� In China, the main ones have been air pollution 
and  local  job  creation�  Phasing  out  nuclear  power  is 
one  reasonfor  Germany’s  energy  transition�  In  the  US, 
improving  energy  security  and  cost-competitiveness 
were  the  main  drivers  for  shifting  to  renewables�  The 
drivers behind India’s transition to a greater renewables 
energy system are different again: as discussed above, 
they  include  economic  growth,  energy  access,  energy 
security,  and  reducing  the  negative  environmental 
impacts of increased fossil fuel use, such as air pollution�
Despite  its  growing  energy  demand,  India  installs 
the  least  amount  of  renewable  power  generation 
capacity each year of the countries shown in Table 2 (if 
hydropower is excluded)� China has installed very much 
more  renewable  power  than  any  other  country  in  the 
world, around 10 GW per year (excluding hydropower)� 
With its ambitious targets, India is now aiming to use its 
rich renewable resource potential to catch up with other 
advanced countries�

Table 3 looks forward to 2030 and some of the major 
changes India can expect, identifying the major drivers 
for  the  country’s  forecasted  growing  energy  demand� 
India will be the world’s most populous country towards 
the  end  of  this  decade�  By  2017/2018  its  population 
will equal China’s and by 2030 will be 18% larger than 
today� More people will live in urban areas by then: some 
610 million compared to today’s 415 million, up from 32% 
to  40%  of  the  population�  That  would  mean  building 
nearly 200 new cities of a million people each� Most of 
India’s population, furthermore, is expected to be under 
the age of 30�
India has already used most of its hydropower potential, 
and  intends  to  add  the  bulk  of  this  non-fossil  fuel 
capacity in the form of solar and wind power� In China, 
large hydropower and nuclear together contribute 24% 
of  its  installed  capacity  mix�  That  is  significantly  more 
than the 7% contributed by solar and wind power, though 
their  share  is  rising  rapidly�  In  comparison,  renewable 
energy  (excluding  large  hydro)  contributes  13%  of 
India’s  installed  capacity  mix,  with  large  hydropower 
and  nuclear  together  contributing  17%�  India  will  add 
236 GW of non-fossil-fuel capacity, compared to China’s 
800-1000 GW, up to 2030, to reach a 20% share of total 
primary energy demand�
India’s  total  primary  energy  supply  has  also  been 
growing  fast,  increasing  by  64%  over  the  2000-2011 
period� By contrast, it has declined in both the US and 
Germany� China’s growth was even higher, at 135%, but 
in  recent  years  it  has  been  slowing  down  and  this  is 
expected to continue in the short-term� By comparison, 
India’s energy demand is expected to double over the 
2014 to 2030 timeframe, driven by increasing population 
and per capita income, as well as the need to reach the 
goal of 98% electricity access� The growing demand for 
power in India will need to be met by a combination of 
fossil fuels and renewables� India is expecting to surpass 
China’s coal demand over the next few years, and will 
require a power capacity of over 800 GW by 2030, up 
from  around  275  in  2014�  It  is  to  raise  non-fossil-fuel 
capacity  from  today’s  84�5  GW  (37  GW  of  renewable 
energy, 5�5 GW of nuclear and 42 GW of large hydro) to 
320 GW in 2030� At present, non-fossil fuels contribute 
just over 30% of the total capacity of 277 GW� As India’s 
total  electricity  capacity  multiplies  almost  three  times 
over  between  now  and  2030,  non-fossil  fuel  capacity 
will have almost to quadruple if it is to reach the target 
of a 40% share of the total�
In  addition,  there  are  a  host  of  policies  which,  if 
implemented,  will  enable  the  country  successfully  to 
pursue sustainable development� They include reforming 
building  codes  and  rationalising  prices  in  freight 
transport by eliminating subsidies (Bloomberg, 2014b) 
and  would  complement  current  policy  support  for 
renewable energy and energy efficiency�
Indian manufacturing is being given a boost – under the 
National Manufacturing Policy of 2011 and the “Make in 
India” programme pursued by the current Government 
–  so  that  it  can  contribute  25%  of  GDP  in  the  coming 
decade,  up  from  15%  at  present�  This  policy  identifies 
focusing on ‘greener and cleaner’ technologies and local 
value  chain  creation  as  priorities�  It  recommends  that 
the  green  manufacturing  committee  applies  objective 
criteria  to  identify  such  technologies,  consistent  with 
the  NAPCC�  Similarly,  the  National  Solar  Mission  (one 
of the eight missions under the NAPCC) aims to create 
a  conducive  environment  for  manufacturing  in  the 
solar  energy  sector,  to  reduce  the  dependency  on 
imports  and  to  develop  India  as  a  solar  energy  hub�

Box 5: Renewable energy jobs in India
Analysis by IRENA (2016d) estimates that 416 000 people work in the renewable energy industry in India� This 
excludes large hydropower which is estimated to employ another 104 000�
The solar PV industry employs an estimated 103 000 people in grid-connected (31 000 jobs) and off-grid 
applications (72 000 jobs)� The biogas sector employs 85 000 people and the wind energy sector employs 
an estimated 48 000� India has the largest market for solar lanterns, with an estimated 700 000 – 800 000 
units as of 2010� About 40% of the 110 companies active in the solar portable light manufacturing industry 
worldwide are headquartered in India and make up 30% of global sales� (IRENA, 2013a)�

India has an installed total of 4�1 million family-size biogas plants (with 1-6 m3 capacity), making it a distant 
second to China (MNRE and CII, 2010)� MNRE has estimated that available dung could support some 12 million 
plants (Arora et al�, 2010)� Slightly more than 100 000 such plants were installed during the financial year 
2008/2009,  saving  120 000  tons  of  fuelwood�  The  Government  estimates  that  some  200 000  jobs  could 
eventually be created in the biogas sector, up from the present 85 000� An assessment concluded in October 
2010  that  Indian manufacturers of biogas  plants were “steadily improving their technology and products, 
which has led to an establishment of Indian companies in the global market� Thus, foreign companies trying to 
break into the Indian market face strong competition from established Indian companies in the Indian market 
who have knowledge of local conditions and requirements�” (IRENA, 2013a)�
A report by Bridge to India and Tata Power Solar, concludes that there is a realisable potential of between 
110 GW and 145 GW for solar PV in India, which could create 670 000 jobs (India Today, 2014)� If India achieves 
its new target of 100 GW of installed solar energy by 2022, as many as 1�1 million full-time equivalent jobs could 
be created (IRENA, 2016d) – including over 210 000 skilled plant design and site engineering jobs, 18 000 
highly skilled jobs in business development and over 80 000 annual jobs in performance data monitoring� 
Another approximately 183 500 full-time equivalent jobs would be generated if India were to reach its target 
of installing 60 GW of wind energy capacity by 2022� Looking ahead, solar and wind companies in India can 
support the clean energy market by reporting the numbers of jobs their projects create (CEEW, 2015c)�
Furthermore,  the  Government  has  been  developing 
international  collaborations  to  enhance  the  transfer  of 
clean technologies to India� All these efforts are aimed 
at spurring local value creation and growth in green jobs 
while pushing for local innovation�
jobs by 2022 (CEEW, 2016)� Unlike in other developed 
countries, where a transition to renewables may result 
in  job  losses  in  the  fossil  fuel  sector,  the  renewable 
energy  sector  in  India  is  supplementary  to  it  and  so 
generates  new  employment  rather  than  redirecting  it, 
since  renewable  energy  capacity  is  often  in  addition 
to  that  of  fossil  fuels�  However,  developers  do  not 
report  job  numbers  voluntarily,  as  in  other  countries, 
so  the  absence  of  a  clear  mandate  to  do  so  by  the 
Job creation is a major driver for policy makers around 
the world, and India is no exception� The country could 
have over one million solar jobs and over 180 000 wind

Box 6: The existing National Solar Mission
The JNNSM (often referred to as the National Solar Mission in this report) was launched in January, 2010 as 
one of eight missions under the NAPCC� It originally set a target of deploying 20 000 MW of grid connected 
solar power, and 2 000 MW of off-grid power by 2022, but this was recently revised up to 100 000 MW� The 
mission aims at reducing the cost of solar power generation in India in order to achieve grid tariff parity by 
2022 through: long term policy; large scale deployment goals; aggressive R&D; and domestic production of 
critical raw materials, components and products,
The National Solar Mission follows a phased approach that allows the government to modify guidelines and 
policies based on the experiences gained and lessons learnt in earlier phases� It has, thus far, successfully 
driven investment, taking India from a cumulative installed capacity of grid connected solar photovoltaic of 
nearly 10 MW in early 2010 to more than 2 500 MW by May 2014�
During its first phase (2010-2013), more than 500 bidders competed for 63 projects allocated during two 
reverse auctions, driving prices to record lows� New solar energy investments in India increased to more than 
USD 2�5 billion in 2011� Phase 1 activities focused largely on achieving 1 000 MW of solar energy through an 
equal split between solar thermal and solar PV project technology�
Competitive bids for the National Solar Mission projects have rapidly driven down tariffs� Phase 1 bids revealed 
prices as low as INR 7�49 (USD 0�15) per kilowatt-hour for PV projects making it competitive with diesel-fired 
captive electricity generation� Phase 2 of the National Solar Mission has set tariffs even lower, to stand at 
INR 5�45/kWh (USD 0�09/kWh) with viability gap funding, and INR 4�75/kWh (USD 0�08/kWh) with accelerated 
depreciation�  Bids  in  2015  and  early  2016  all  came  in  at  around  INR  4�2-5�0/kWh  (USD  0�06-0�07/kWh) 
indicating that prices are at the lower range of the Mission’s target (Gambhir, 2016)�

Note: Analysis based on MNRE, 2016c
Although Indian industries have responded positively to the Solar Mission, it faces several hurdles in moving 
ahead,  if  it  is  to  scale-up  solar  energy�  The  central  government  —  with  co-ordinated  action  by  states, 
developers, financial institutions, manufacturers, research institutes, and communities — needs to develop 
effective solutions for more credible project bids, enforceable RPOs and RECs, strong financial structures, 
increased domestic manufacturing, and reliable power evacuation and transmission�
4 0
The ambition of the programme has been scaled up significantly, with India now targeting 100 GW of solar 
capacity by 2022; 40 GW from rooftop solar projects, and the remaining 60 GW from utility scale ones� The 
next  phase  of  the  National  Solar  Mission  aims  significantly  to  increase  annual  installed  capacity  to  reach 
the goal of 100 GW by 2022� Its annual target has increased from 2 GW in 2015 to 12 GW in 2016� By 2017 
annual installations should amount to 15 GW, reaching 17�5 GW by 2021� (The targets under each phase count 
total  progress  in  installed  capacity  under  both  the  direct  central  government  programme  and  the  state 
programmes)� The level of capacity installation growth is shown in Figure 16�

Security of affordable energy supply
central  government  creates  a  roadblock  in  analysing 
job creation�
Despite the competitive direct costs of fossil fuels, broad 
motivations for promoting renewable energy in India are 
provided by such factors as exclusion for the poor (who 
either do not have access to the energy markets or are 
unable to pay for energy services), the instability caused 
in  the  energy  market  by  fluctuations  in  energy  prices, 
and other real and potential market failures� Renewables 
are also increasingly emerging as the least-cost option 
for meeting the country’s rising energy needs�
In India, as in other developing countries, public support 
helps to drive the deployment of renewables and this, 
in  turn,  drives  down  their  price  and  encourages  job 
creation across the value chain, such as in manufacturing, 
installations, financing, and maintenance
A broad motivation for promoting 
renewable energy in India is to respond to a 
series of real and potential market failures, 
in energy access, energy security, climate 
change, and local environmental challenges
Ensuring  access  to  energy  is  central  to  India’s  policy, 
which  aims  to  address  the  underlying  demand  for 
energy services� The household sector consumes nearly 
4 1
39%  of  the  total  energy  supplied  in  the  country:  a 
significant  proportion  of  this  (around  three-quarters) 
is  provided  by  traditional  biomass  based  fuels  –  like 
firewood,  dung  cakes,  and  charcoal  –  which  are  not 
accounted  for  in  official  statistics�  This  indicates  the 
pressing need for increasing access to modern energy 
sources for millions of Indians�
by  a  history  of  policies  and  programmes  aimed  at 
enhancing  rural  electrification  going  as  far  back  as 
1969  when  the  Rural  Electrification  Corporation  was 
established�  The  Corporation  promotes  and  finances 
a  wide  range  of  rural  energy  projects,  including  grid-
connected,  off-grid,  renewables  or  conventional  fuel 
driven  power  generation,  power  conservation  and 
power distribution network initiatives�
The energy policy also aims to cater for India’s growing 
energy demand and domestic supply gaps� Even under 
an  aggressive  scenario  of  global  climate  stabilisation, 
India would consume at least 60% more energy in 2035 
than today� Varying output from domestic fuel sources, 
volatile prices of imports and uncertainty in geopolitical 
conditions, all lead to concerns about the predictability 
and stability of fuel supplies�
India  has  limited  sources  of  fossil  fuels  and  is  not 
geographically  adjacent  to  any  major  sources  of 
supplies,  making  it  vulnerable  to  geopolitical  and 
geo-economic  shocks�  The  country’s  energy  security 
policy, therefore, needs to be viewed through a wide 
lens,  considering  supply  and  demand  issues  from  a 
planning  and  financial  perspective  at  both  the  micro 
and  macro  scale  (TERI,  2015)�  Renewable  energy 
should be considered as a viable alternative that can 
mitigate this risk, at least in part, and offer the double 
advantage of allowing energy access to the poor and 
aiding  energy  security  by  diversifying  the  sources  of 
supply�
The pursuit of energy access and energy security enjoys 
considerable political support, and is recognised in the 
Integrated Energy Policy (IEP), which considers energy 
security as providing all Indians with an energy lifeline, 
regardless of their ability to pay for it� This is supported 
Box 7: Climate Change
India now accounts for 6% of total global CO2 emissions, making it the world’s third largest national emitter, 
after China (23% of the global total) and the US (16%) (this excludes the EU-28 which accounts for 11%)� It 
will also play a key role in reducing the growth of global CO2 emissions� It released its INDC in October, 2015, 
pledging to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33% to 35% of the 2005 level by 2030�
It realises that its ambitious renewable energy targets will help to reduce emission growth, but is nevertheless 
simultaneously  expanding  its  coal  mining  activities,  the  largest  contributor  to  its  increasing  emissions 
(Reuters,  2015), mainly because it needs to grow its economy (CEEW, 2015a)� India still  needs  to  provide 
energy access to a quarter of its population, and will try to do this at the least cost, so as to provide affordable 
electricity� Renewables can play an important role in realising this objective if deployment starts now and 
their cost-effectiveness improves� Otherwise, there is a risk that coal will continue to be used for meeting the 
exponentially growing electricity demand�
So far, the contribution of manufacturing industry to India’s economy is less 25% of GDP, much lower than 
in  China,  for  example�  It  will  have  to  grow  at  much  higher  rates  if  India  is  to  overcome  its  development 
challenges,  and  will  thus  increase  the  country’s  energy  demand  and  related  emissions�  Renewables  offer 
industry an alternative to fossil fuels, and India is one of the world’s frontrunners in deploying solar thermal 
energy and various forms of biomass for process heat� If such practices can be significantly expanded to cover 
increasing demand, emission growth can be reduced while the economy expands�
Various analyses (e�g� CEEW, 2015a) show that India could increase its renewable energy ambition significantly 
by 2030 to meet its growing energy needs, while reducing emissions� The country would, however, need to 
consider the related costs of realising such targets while ensuring it overcomes its development challenges� 
So any commitment to climate change must be built on technology partnerships and financial mechanisms�
4 2
Environmental Concerns and Climate Change
to  INR  400/tonne  (USD  6)  in  the  2016/2017  period 
(Economic Times, 2016b)�
Climate change mitigation in India, as in most countries 
around  the  world,  is  addressed  by  such  measures  as 
end-use energy efficiency and pursuing renewables� The 
country’s INDC includes a commitment to decrease the 
emissions intensity of its GDP by 33% to 35% from 2005 
levels by 2030 (see box 7)� India launched its NAPCC in 
June 2008, setting out eight ‘missions’ to support action: 
the  most  prominent  are  the  National  Solar  Mission 
(see  Box  7)  and  the  Mission  for  Enhanced  Energy 
Efficiency�  The  NAPCC  was  seen  as  a  way  to  connect 
climate change mitigation and energy security, and to 
pursue  both  goals  collectively�  An  analysis  of  Indian 
and global governance highlighted the availability of a 
vast  market for future investment in clean  technology 
and a corresponding need to deepen bilateral relations 
to  develop,  and  secure  access  to,  energy  and  climate 
related technologies�
4�2  Key characteristics of 
the India’s energy policy 
framework
India’s  target  of  175  GW  installed  renewable  energy 
capacity by 2022 is indicative of its firm commitment to 
scaling it up� This target has led to much enthusiasm in 
the market, and recent efforts are bearing fruit – such 
as  auctions  for  solar  PV  –  but  further  efforts  will  be 
needed  for  timely  realisation  of  this  ambitious  target� 
Governmental policies need to be strengthened in order 
to tackle problems of policy uncertainty, governmental 
clearances,  availability  of  finance,  health  of  the 
transmission  and  distribution  networks,  and  financial 
health  of  the  state  electricity  boards,  if  the  country  is 
realistically to pursue the target�
Local environments, in a country greatly reliant on coal-
based thermal power, are plagued with multiple issues 
beyond the challenge of climate change� These include 
air  pollution  (see  box  8),  related  respiratory  diseases 
and water pollution (New York Times, 2015)� Renewable 
energy deployment has gained impetus from growing 
civil  society  opposition  to  the  local  environmental 
impacts  of  coal-based  power�  Environmental  Impact 
Assessments  (EIA)  have  been  prevalent  in  India  since 
the late 1970s and the Environmental Protection Act has 
been in place for 30 years (since 1986)� An amendment 
to  the  act  in  2006  excluded  wind  and  solar  projects 
from EIA requirements in order to accelerate renewable 
energy�
The 
feasibility,  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of 
governmental  policies  depends  on  the  characteristics 
of  the  national  energy  policy  system  of  governance� 
Policies  applied  in  China,  Europe,  or  the  US  are  not 
directly applicable to India� However, adopting general 
recommendations and lessons from countries at more 
advanced  levels  of  renewable  energy  adoption  is 
possible, helpful and ongoing� In setting its targets, India 
has drawn from the experience of countries around the 
world that have scaled up renewable energy by relying 
significantly on rooftop solar systems: thus the 100 GW 
solar target contains a 40 GW solar rooftop sub-target� 
This indicates how policy lessons are transferable, even 
if  the  modalities  of  implementing  them  with  support 
policies  like  FiTs,  net  metering  policies  or  financial 
support schemes are unique to each country�
In  late  2015,  the  Indian  Ministry  of  Environment  and 
Forests  announced  stricter  standards  for  coal-based 
thermal power generation so as to minimise pollutants� 
These  revised  standards  are  to  be  implemented  in  a 
phased  manner,  based  on  the  age  of  the  coal  power 
plant,  with  three  groups:  those  installed  before  2014; 
those installed from 2014-2016; and those installed after 
2016�  The  new  standards  aim  to  reduce  emissions  of 
PM10  (maximum  emissions  of  0�98  kg/MWh),  sulphur 
dioxide  (maximum  emissions  of  7�3  kg/MWh)  and 
nitrogen  oxide  (maximum  emissions  of  4�8  kg/MWh) 
(MOEF,  2015)�  Water  consumption  in  new  plants  will 
be  limited  to  2�5  litre/kWh  (Gambhir,  2016)�  The  clean 
energy  tariff  on  coal  will  increase  from  INR  50/tonne 
The  government’s  ambitious  renewables  target  can 
easily  be  achieved  if  some  of  the  key  issues  faced  by 
the private sector are addressed� However, the process 
of  doing  this  is  complex,  as  in  most  countries,  and  is 
often  drawn  out  over  a  long  period�  Policy  initiatives 
have  been  put  in  place  at  the  central  and  state  levels 
for both grid-connected and off-grid renewable energy� 
Scaling  up  the  renewable  energy  sector  hinges  on 
the  combination  of  funding  mechanisms,  legislative 
frameworks,  institutional  arrangements,  and  other 
efforts  which  work  together  to  support  implementing 
strategies, policies and programmes�

Box 8: Economic impacts of fossil fuel combustion related air pollution in India
The  economic  cost  of  outdoor  air  pollution  health  impacts  has  reached  3%  of  India’s  GDP  (World  Bank, 
2013b) and the estimated number of deaths from ambient air pollution (related to PM and ozone) reached 
700 000 in 2010, up from 692 000 in 2005� The Global Burden Disease report has estimated that there are 
620 000 premature deaths in India from air pollution-related diseases each year (Down to Earth, 2013)� The 
Years of Life Lost (YLLs) from air pollution reached 18 million in 2010, while the DALYs reached 19 million 
(OECD, 2014)� DALYs from indoor air pollution from biomass combustion stand at 5�5 million
Coal used in power generation is alone estimated to shorten life expectancy in India by 2�5 years on average, 
according to a study that modelled its effects (Burt, Oris and Buchanan, 2013)� Changing climate trends and 
air  pollutants  also  hit  agricultural  yields�  According  to  Burney  and  Ramanathan  (2013),  they  had  reduced 
yields by 36% by 2010, and by as much as 50% in densely-populated areas�
Fossil-fuel  based  heat  and  power  and  transport  results  in  outdoor  and  indoor  air  pollution�  Emissions  of 
fine particulates are some five times higher than the recommended threshold� Domestic sources and waste 
burning contribute 10-20% of total urban air pollution (Dalberg, 2013)�
Traffic  growth  is  the  main  driver  of  deteriorating  air  quality  (OECD,  2014)�  India  has  been  adopting  Euro 
vehicle classes quite ambitiously – Euro 4 had been adopted in 13 major cities by 2009 (UNEP Risoe, 2013)� 
Half of the 180 cities monitored in 2010, and 60% of their population, are exposed to critical levels of PM10 
emissions� Air pollution is increasing in large and small cities alike, thanks to both transport and other emission 
sources like coal combustion for power generation and polluting industries such as ceramics next to densely-
populated areas�
One reason that emissions are rising so fast is that rather old emission standards are still in force in India 
(New  York  Times,  2012),  though  new  standards  are  coming  into  effect�  Varying  climatic  and  geographic 
conditions over India’s large territory mean that the economic costs of health impacts vary from place to 
place� New Delhi, for example, has an air pollution problem when diesel heaters start operating, making it one 
of the world’s most polluted cities in winter� A huge cloud of pollution cloud stands in front of the Himalayas, 
whereas  the  effects  of  coastal  coal  plants  is  rather  limited  since  wind  disperses  their  emissions�  Burning 
biomass is a prime source of both indoor and outdoor pollution�
India,  concludes  a  study  by  Yale  and  Columbia  universities  that  assessed  132  countries,  has  the  worst  air 
pollution in the entire world� Its high PM2�5 levels are about five times above the threshold considered unsafe 
for human beings� PM causes acute respiratory diseases – the most common causes of deaths in children 
under five in India (NY Times, 2012) – and is linked to cancer� The benefits of cleaning up coal power plants are 
25 times higher than the costs (Burt, Oris and Buchanan, 2013)� Markandya et al� (2009) found much higher 
benefits from mitigating carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector in India (USD 46-49/t CO2) than 
for the EU and China (in the order of 2-7 USD/t CO2), but this includes savings from a switch to renewables, 
which also offer significant benefits�
A  shift  from  burning  coal  to  generate  electricity  will  reduce  both  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  fine-
particulate  air  pollution�  Several  studies  have  estimated  the  probable  health  benefits�  Roughly  90 000 
premature deaths could be averted in India every year (Haines, et al�, 2012)�
A  theoretical  case  study  suggested  that  a  programme  providing  150  million  low-emission  household 
cookstoves over a decade would provide 87% of Indian households with clean combustion, either through 
advanced biomass stoves or through graduating to clean fuels� By 2020, some 240 000 children under 5 
years would be saved from death from acute lower respiratory infections, and more than 1�8 million premature 
adult deaths from ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would be averted� The 
total savings for the decade would amount to 55 million DALYs, an average of 5�5 million DALYs per year 
(Wilkinson et al�, 2009)�
4 4
The  key  legislation  guiding  the  development  of 
renewable  energy  in  India  is  the  Electricity  Act,  2003, 
which, amongst others, mandates the State Electricity 
Regulatory  Commissions 
to  promote 
generating  electricity  from  renewable  sources  by 
providing  suitable  measures  for  connecting  to  the 
grid  and  selling  electricity  to  any  person  and  also 
specify,  for  purchase  of  electricity  from  such  sources, 
a percentage of the total consumption of electricity in 
the area of a distribution licensee� The Ministry of Power 
is responsible for the administration of this Act and the 
Energy Conservation Act 2001 and for amendments to 
them� The NTP of 2006 directs States to fix minimum 
percentages for purchasing renewable power and – as 
amended  in  early  2016  –  to  promote  faster  adoption 
of  renewable  energy  and  power  sourcing  through 
competitive  bidding�  Procuring  renewable  power  for 
future  requirements  is  to  take  place  through  such  a 
bidding process� MNRE released bidding documents for 
grid-connected  renewable  energy  in  December  2012 
after several rounds of consultations with stakeholders�
India�  The  National  Institute  of  Solar  Energy  (NISE)  – 
an  apex  national  R&D  institute  –  has  testing  facilities 
accredited  by  the  National  Accreditation  Board  for 
Laboratories  (NABL)  for  solar  PV  modules,  lighting 
systems,  batteries,  water  pumping  systems  and  small 
and large solar thermal systems� Similarly, MNRE set up 
the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) for wind 
energy technologies� The Sardar Swaran Singh National 
Institute  of  Renewable  Energy  is  focused  on  solid, 
liquid  and  gaseous  bioenergy,  biofuels  and  synthetic 
fuels  for  transport�  Also  the  Alternate  Hydro  Energy 
Centre  (AHEC)  provides  expertise  in  developing  small 
hydropower in hilly areas�
(SERCs) 
State  governments  have  nodal  agencies  and 
departments  operating  under  their  purview  for 
effectively  implementing  all  renewable  energy  and 
cogeneration schemes� These promote local renewable 
energy  deployment  by  channelling  subsidies  from  the 
centre�  The  MNRE  provides  them  with  grants  for  their 
recurring  and  non-recurring  expenditure�  Financial 
assistance  to  renewable  energy  projects  is  provided 
through  the  Indian  Renewable  Energy  Development 
Agency  (IREDA)  –  the  financial  arm  of  the  MNRE, 
operating  like  a  green  bank  –  which  provides  loans 
and  channels  funds  and  other  initiatives  (TERI,  2014)� 
It is registered as a non-banking financial company and 
arranges  its  resources  through  market  borrowing  and 
lines  of  credit  from  bilateral  and  multilateral  lending 
agencies�  The  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural 
Development (NABARD) – a development bank set up 
by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  –  channels  money 
received from Finance Ministry or MNRE to rural areas 
for  developing  off-grid  solar  power  generation  and 
applications related to rural development� Rural banking 
arms  of  various  private  banks  also  actively  finance 
developing  small  and  large  scale  renewable  energy 
projects�
The allocation for solar power has already taken place 
through competitive bidding, under the National Solar 
Mission  and  state  solar  policies,  but  these  guidelines 
seek to also cover all other renewable energy sources, 
such as wind, small hydropower, geothermal, biomass, 
and  tidal  energy�  They  seek  to  create  competition  in 
the  grid-connected  renewable  energy  sector,  to  bring 
transparency  and  fairness  in  allocation,  to  reduce 
information  asymmetries  among  bidders,  to  achieve 
standardisation, and hence to reduce ambiguity in the 
whole process of project allocation (TERI, 2015)�
Multiple  agencies  are  involved  in  India’s  renewable 
energy sector� At the centre, the MNRE is the GOI’s nodal 
ministry for all matters relating to new and renewable 
energy, with the broad aim of developing and deploying 
them to supplement the country’s energy provision� It 
also conducts resource assessments for renewables and 
supports  R&D  in  renewable  energy  technologies  and 
has  initiated  programmes  to  support  grid-connected 
power  generation  and  off-grid  standalone  micro-grid 
generation, to demonstrate technology and to develop 
human resources�
The Government of India has also get up a commission 
called NITI Aayog (formally the Planning Commission) 
which looks into various aspects of the Indian economy� 
In  2015  it  released  a  Report  on  India  Renewable 
Electricity  Roadmap  2030  (NITI  Aayog,  2015)  which 
aims  to  accelerate  renewable  electricity  deployment� 
While the report does not detail targets or an estimated 
energy mix for 2030, it does have a thorough discussion 
on policy, finance and grid integration issues related to 
vigorous deployment of renewable electricity�
The  Ministry  has  also  formed 
independent  and 
collaborative  institutes  to  promote  the  research  and 
enhancement  of  renewable  energy  technologies  in 
4 5
Box 9: International Solar Alliance
The International Solar Alliance is a platform to bring together countries with rich solar potential, along with 
solar innovators, developers, and financiers� It aims to aggregate demand for solar energy across member 
countries, thus creating a global buyers’ market, and thereby reducing prices, facilitating the deployment of 
existing solar technologies at scale, and promoting collaborative solar R&D and capacity�
Countries around the world are adopting and advancing their targets in order to transition to a solar-rich 
energy future while international, national and regional organisations are working to support governments to 
advance development and deployment� There are, however, three important roadblocks in the way of rapidly 
scaling up solar energy:
 ● The high cost of financing solar in many regions;
 ● The speed, scale, and skill requirements of deploying available solar technologies; and
 ● The ‘solar technology trap’ of becoming overcommitted to a particular technology�
The International Solar Alliance will accordingly focus on:
 ● Helping to coordinate action to lower the cost of finance for each type of solar energy, whether industrial 
captive power, commercial rooftop, residential rooftop, rural off-grid solar, or utility scale solar;
 ● Simultaneously experimenting with and replicating various business models and tailoring action to the 
needs of countries, so as to allow rapid scaling up with the most suitable business and financial model, and 
an easily available trained technical and managerial workforce; and
 ● Promoting  the  development  of  strategic  and  collaborative  solar  R&D  so  as  to  avoid  getting  locked 
into  a  single  type  of  technology�  Encouraging  and  rewarding  R&D  advancement  in  future  and  related 
technologies to improve the efficiency and integration of solar power, as well as to increase the number of 
available solar applications�
Encouraged  by  the  success  of  the  National  Solar 
Mission,  several  states  announced  their  own  state 
solar  policies  and  programmes  (though  Gujarat  took 
a lead in announcing its solar policy a year before the 
Mission)�  State  policies  are  broadly  aligned  with  the 
Mission’s objectives, though there are some differences: 
several state policies, for example, have not followed its 
approach of mandating domestic content requirements 
for  projects�  India  has  also  spearheaded  the  creation 
of  the  International  Solar  Alliance,  expected  to  begin 
operations in late 2016, to further promote solar energy 
in the country and worldwide (see Box 9)�
renewable  energy�  It  mandates  SERCs  to  fix  quotas 
for the percentage of electricity being handled by the 
power utilities so as to procure power from renewable 
energy sources� It requires SERCs to determine the tariff 
for  all  renewable  energy  projects  across  their  states 
and to ensure connectivity to the grid for project sites 
in  remote  locations  and  far  from  major  load  centres� 
The  Act  necessitates  the  preparation  and  notification 
of  a  National  Electricity  Policy,  a  Tariff  Policy  and,  a 
Grid Code, so as to use the country’s energy resources 
optimally� These are periodically amended and updated 
in  order  to  stay  relevant  to  the  constantly  changing 
energy portfolio�
4�3  Overarching power generation 
and transmission policies
The  Electricity  Act  also  stipulated  that  the  CEA 
prepare a National Electricity Plan� The Plan would be 
for  a  short-term  framework  of  five  years  while  giving 
a  15  year  perspective  that  includes:  short-term  and 
long-term  demand  forecasts  for  regions;  suggested 
areas or locations for capacity additions in generation 
India’s  Electricity  Act  of  2003  paved  the  way  for 
regulatory 
interventions,  which  supported  and 
accelerated  the  development  and  deployment  of 
4 6
and  transmission;  outlining  areas  where  improvement 
of  the  transmission  system  could  occur  and  where 
development  of  a  national  grid,  efficient  generation, 
a  better  transmission  and  distribution  could  be 
implemented;  and  finally  what  types  of  fuels  should 
be  chosen  based  on  economic,  energy  security  and 
environment  considerations�  The  first  plan  with  five-
year  perspective  was  notified  in  2007,  and  released 
several  years  later�  The  second  plan  (the  latest)  was 
notified to be in preparation in 2013, and the first draft 
volume  focused  on  generation  (the  second  volume 
focus  is  on  transmission)  was  released  in  December, 
2016 (MoP, 2016)� It assesses the peak load and energy 
requirement  for  the  period  2017-2022,  and  provides  a 
perspective forecast for the 2022-2027 period�
different  energy  sources�  It  emphasises  the  need  to 
step away from capital subsidies towards performance 
incentives,  such  as  a  tradable  tax  rebate  certificate 
(TTRC) that could be based on actual energy generated� 
It also suggests that power regulators create alternative 
incentive  structures  such  as  mandated  feed-in  laws 
or  differential  tariffs  to  support  utilities  in  integrating 
power  from  renewable  energy  sources  into  their 
systems� Several states are moving in this direction with 
the  development  of  net-metering  policies  and  FiTs: 
at least 9 (of 29) states have announced net-metering 
policies in support of distributed renewable energy�
Other approaches that assist in supporting decentralised 
renewables (i�e� rooftop solar PV) by providing subsidies 
to  lower  capital  expenditure  are  also  being  pursued, 
while  policies  that  support  self-consumption  are  also 
being implemented� The IEP envisions a limited role in 
power  generation  for  renewable  energy  sources,  with 
them only providing 5-6% of electricity in the grid as late 
as 2032 – a share that was already exceeded by 2010� 
The  policy  also  suggests  that  they  would  only  prove 
a  crucial  component  to  India’s  energy  independence 
beyond  2050�  However,  other  policies  and  recent 
initiatives  by  both  the  central  government  and  some 
state governments like those in Gujarat, Rajasthan, and 
Tamil Nadu, indicate the growing role of renewables in 
the energy mix�
The  National  Electricity  Policy  calls  for  better  use  of 
non-conventional  energy  sources,  including  solar  and 
wind,  for  additional  power  generation  capacity,  and 
recognises  the  need  to  reduce  the  capital  costs  of 
renewable energy projects by promoting competition�
The NTP mandates SERCs to fix a minimum percentage 
of  RPOs  from  renewable  energy  sources,  taking  into 
account their availability in the region and the impact on 
retail tariffs and procurement by distribution companies 
at  preferential  tariffs  that  the  SERCs  determine�  The 
policy  was  amended  in  January  2011  to  prescribe  that 
solar-specific  RPOs  be  increased  from  a  minimum  of 
0�25 % in 2012 to 3% by 2022 – and was further amended 
in early 2016 to enable faster promotion of renewables 
to meet the country’s recent targets�
The NAPCC – announced by the GOI on 30 July, 2008 – 
outlined eight national missions to achieve a low-carbon 
growth  path  Missions  on  Solar  Energy,  on  Enhanced 
Energy Efficiency, on Sustainable Habitat, on Conserving 
Water,  on  Sustaining  the  Himalayan  Ecosystem,  on 
creating a “Green India”, on Sustainable Agriculture and, 
finally, on establishing a Strategic Knowledge Platform 
for Climate Change�
The  Indian  Electricity  Grid  Code  (IEGC)  2010  was 
developed  by  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory 
Commission  (CERC),  which  lays  down  both  the 
methodology  for  scheduling  wind  and  solar  energy 
and  a  basis  for  compensating  the  states  with  a  large 
wind  and  solar  energy  potential  for  dealing  with  the 
potentially  large  degree  of  variability  in  generation� 
This  is  done  through  a  renewable  regulatory  charge 
operated  through  the  Renewable  Regulatory  Fund 
(RRF)  mechanism�  The  Code  stipulates  that  power 
system operators (state/regional load dispatch centres) 
shall  make  all  efforts  to  evacuate  the  available  power 
from renewable energy sources�
Government targets include the 100 GW solar PV and 
60 GW wind energy goals to be achieved by 2022, plus 
targets  for  biomass  (10  GW)  and  small  hydropower 
(5  GW)�  However,  the  decade-long  Remote  Village 
Electrification Programme (RVEP) – under which solar 
home lighting solutions were distributed to about 10,000 
villages – was discontinued in 2012� Some of its systems 
are suspected of having fallen into disuse, and batteries 
will reach the end of their useful lives and will need to 
be replaced� Whilst several policies have an impact on 
– and encourage – rural electrification, no replacement 
for the programme has yet been introduced�
The  IEP,  formulated  by  the  Planning  Commission  of 
India  in  2006,  provides  a  broad  framework  for  all 
policies  governing  production,  distribution  and  use  of 
4 7
As  one  of  its  strategies  to  combat  climate  change, 
NAPCC  envisages  renewable  energy  as  constituting 
around 15% of India’s total final energy mix by 2020� To 
achieve  this,  a  minimum  share  of  renewable  energy  is 
pegged in the national grid at 5%, starting in 2009/10 
and  this  is  to  be  increased  by  1%  per  annum  so  as  to 
reach 15% by 2020 (MNRE, 2016a)� (As noted earlier in 
this section, the NAPCC targets are not in alignment with 
those already-realised in the IEP)� Another clean energy 
initiative under the NAPCC includes promoting trade in 
RECs across states in order to increase compliance with 
RPOs�
from the energy sector� This indicates the urgent need 
for  policy  mechanisms  to  encourage  the  uptake  of 
renewable energy in transport while reducing increasing 
reliance  on  imported  petroleum  fuels�  India  has  the 
largest  light-duty  vehicle  fleet  in  the  world  without 
efficiency  or  CO2  emission  standards�  The  country’s 
Bureau  of  Energy  Efficiency  has,  however,  proposed 
instituting  new  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Consumption 
standards,  which  could  result  in  higher  fuel  efficiency 
for the light-duty fleet, mandating a 14% increase in fuel 
efficiency by 2016, and additional increases in discussion 
could require a further 38% increase by 2021/22�
While the use of renewable fuels for transport is still at 
a  very  nascent  stage,  the  government  has  developed 
policies, through several different agencies, to support 
its  uptake�  The  Indian  Ministry  of  Railways  launched  a 
‘Vision 2020’ plan in December 2009 proposing that a 
target of 10% of the total energy consumed by the Indian 
railways should be sourced from renewables� However, 
no significant progress has been made in reaching this 
target, though pilot projects at railway stations, railway 
signals and level-crossing gates are underway�
4�4  Heating, cooling and cooking 
policies
A large proportion of the policies aimed at renewable 
energy  integration  in  India  are  focussed  on  power 
generation,  but  renewables  offer  a  suite  of  other 
applications,  particularly  for  heating,  cooling,  cooking 
and  mechanical  operations,  and  these  would  greatly 
enhance  the  acceptance  of  renewables  amongst  the 
population of the country at large�
The Ministry has also entered into a joint venture with 
RITES Ltd�, so as to set up a railway energy management 
company  to  undertake  projects  harnessing  renewable 
power�  These  include  solar  and  wind  power  plants, 
power  trading  activities,  transmission  lines  and  power 
evacuation  planning,  energy  conservation  initiatives, 
efficient  co-ordination  in  power  generation  through 
captive power plant, and energy audits� The company 
will also facilitate faster execution of renewable energy 
and energy conservation works with the aim of reducing 
of  Indian  Railways’  energy  bill�  Similarly,  the  Ministry 
of  Heavy  Industries  &  Public  Enterprise  launched  a 
‘National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020’ in August 
2012� This includes interventions to reduce dependence 
on  fossil  fuels  and  promote  the  transition  to  electric 
vehicles  powered  by  renewable  energy�  Advances  on 
electrifying vehicles have so far been limited�
MNRE provides policy support for various renewables, 
bearing  in  mind  the  substantial  scope  of  such  non-
electricity applications in providing energy to people on 
both small and large scales� Schemes run by both the 
central and state governments include a capital subsidy 
for solar water heaters as part of the NAPCC, subsidies 
under  the  national  solar  mission  for  solar  desalination 
systems,  and  policy  support  to  wind  desalination 
systems through the MNRE programme on small wind 
energy  and  hybrid  systems�  India  has  local,  state  and 
regional programmes to support clean cooking, and is 
working  with  such  international  organisations  as  the 
Global  Alliance  for  Clean  Cookstoves  to  help  promote 
greater adoption of modern and clean forms of cooking� 
Some  important  renewable  sources  have  largely  been 
overlooked: there are, for instance, no support policies 
for geothermal cooling systems�
4�6  City and state level policy 
making for renewables
4�5  Transport policies
India’s  transport  sector  is  a  major  energy  consumer, 
accounting  for  more  than  half  of  the  country’s  total 
petroleum consumption and a quarter of its total energy� 
It  accounts  for  about  13%  of  the  carbon  emissions 
Some  of  the  support  framework  required  for  up 
scaling  renewable  energy  in  India  has  to  be  provided 
at state level� State nodal agencies have been set up to 
implement  the  policy  measures  determined  nationally 
4 8
by  the  MNRE  and  to  decide  additional  state-specific 
policy  that  promote  implementing  renewable  energy 
projects�  The  states,  however,  often  tend  to  support 
incumbent  energy  actors  and  their  state-level  public 
utilities,  and  to  subsidise  power  for  consumers�  They 
also determine how to implement national policies, and 
this can result in big differences in how programmes are 
administered�  An  overview  of  some  states’  renewable 
policies show how important, and dynamic, such local 
policy implementation can be�
(in  the  form  of  developed  land,  water,  gas  availability 
and  access  roads,  and  power  transmission  systems) 
to  set  up  solar  power  generation  plants  by  private 
developers� The advantages of solar parks include:
 ●
Reductions  in  the  cost  of  solar  power  by 
providing  economies  of  scale  in  procurement, 
the acquisition of permits, and the development 
of power;
 ●
Reductions in the risks of project implementation 
for  developers  and  the  expedition  of  project 
execution; and
So far ten Indian states have announced their own solar 
policies� The Rajasthan Solar Policy, adopted in 2011, is 
indicative of  the type developed and  implemented  by 
various states� Targeting 700 MW of solar power by 2017, 
it  is  administered  by  the  state  nodal  agency  –  the 
Rajasthan  Renewable  Energy  Corporation  Limited�  It 
provides a preferential tariff, and promotes developing 
solar  parks,  setting  up  an  infrastructure  development 
fund, providing government land at concessional rates, 
it  also  provides  exemption  from  the  cost  of  electricity 
transmission  and  single  window  project  clearance� 
Similar policies have been adopted by Tamil Nadu, Uttar 
Pradesh,  Andhra  Pradesh,  Karnataka,  Punjab,  Madhya 
Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Jharkhand�
 ●
Preserving  grid  connectivity,  which  has 
not  emerged  as  a  major  issue  in  Gujarat  and 
Rajasthan  (where  the  majority  of  solar  PV  is 
being  deployed)  partly  because  of  the  states’ 
approach to using solar parks�
There  is  also  a  large  push  to  promote  solar  in  urban 
areas� Developing solar cities has been an active policy 
in  India  since  2008:  over  60  cities  and  towns  take 
part  in  the  “Solar  Cities”  programme  (see  Box  10)� 
Many programmes and financing options are available 
level,  as  discussed 
both  centrally  and  at  state 
earlier  in  this  chapter�  These  can  include  income  tax 
breaks,  accelerated  depreciation,  tariff  payments  for 
renewable  generation,  import  concessions,  and  other 
generation-based  incentives�  Many  cities  are  also 
adopting  approaches  to  support  renewable  energy 
and  improvements  in  energy  efficiency  improvements 
through additional measures� Tax rebates are commonly 
offered by local authorities� Such cities such as Thane, 
Amravati, Durgapur and Navi Mumbai have property tax 
rebate programmes ranging from 5% to10% to promote 
either  renewable  energy  or  energy  efficiency�  Many 
municipalities also have green building incentives aimed 
at  encouraging  designs  that  include  highly  efficient 
building  envelopes  and  integrate  solar  thermal  and 
solar  PV�  (ICLEI,  2013)�  An  Energy  Service  Company 
–  a  specialised  service  provider  offering  a  range  of 
energy  solutions  together  with  planning,  designing 
and  implementing  energy  efficiency  projects  –  can 
agree  to  various  types  of  performance  contracts  for 
projects�  Besides  improving  energy  efficiency,  typical 
Energy  Service  Company  projects  can  also  include 
integrating  solar  water  heating,  or  biomass/biogas 
steam generators� Finally, municipal bonds form one of 
the  most  common  methods  for  local  municipalities  to 
Key  provisions  that  states  have  made  for  solar  and 
wind policies include topics relating to land acquisition� 
Conducive  state  land  allocation  policies  can  help  it 
emerge as a favoured destination for renewable energy, 
while unfavourable acquisition policies can discourage 
investments in clean energy projects�
Examples of conducive land acquisition policies include 
the Rajasthan State government allotting land to wind 
and  solar  power  developers  either  on  lease,  or  at  a 
concessional rate of 10% of the market rate, in 2011 and 
2012�  Gujarat  introduced  provisions  for  allocating  the 
state’s  vast  tracts  of  wasteland  for  wind  installations 
in  its  Wind  Power  Policy  of  2013�  On  the  other  hand, 
West  Bengal’s  policy  of  allocating  state-held  land 
through competitive bidding, for example, has hindered 
attracting investments in wind-farm projects�
Solar  Parks  are  another  approach�  State  determined 
policies  on  large  solar  parks  can  be  designed  as  a 
package  deal,  enabling  project  development  timelines 
to be streamlined by allowing government agencies to 
undertake land acquisition and seek necessary permits, 
and also providing a dedicated common infrastructure

support renewable energy� Issuers can include cities and 
regions, redevelopment agencies, districts, and publicly 
owned airports or other entities and the interest earned 
on the bonds is typically free from federal income tax�
Box 10: Solar Cities
Local politics drives much of the transition to an energy future with a greater renewable energy component 
in cities around the world� Peak electricity demand is sky rocketing as India continues to experience rapid 
urbanisation and migration to metropolitan cities, making it increasingly difficult for local electricity utilities 
to service it� In this context, MNRE launched a programme for the ‘Development of Solar Cities’ in February 
2008� The recently revised programme aims, at the very least, at a 10% reduction in projected demand for 
conventional energy after five years: this can be achieved through combining energy efficiency measures and 
increased renewable energy supplies�
All types of renewable energy – such as solar, wind, biomass, small hydropower, and waste to energy – may be 
installed along with possible energy efficiency measures, depending on a city’s need and resource availability� 
Sixty cities and towns are eventually to be enlisted in the ‘Solar Cities’ programme – with a minimum of one 
city, and a maximum of seven, per state� Specifications for being chosen as a solar city include population 
size, which must be between 500 000 and 5 000 000 people�
The programme consolidates existing local efforts to promote renewable energy – such as solar water heating 
systems, rooftop PV systems, and waste to energy systems – and proposes holistic energy management� 
Cities  prepare  a  holistic  master  plan,  which  includes  an  energy  consumption  baseline,  future  demand 
forecasting  and  strategies  per  sector,  and  an  action  plan  for  implementing  renewable  energy  projects  on 
identified sites to reduce their fossil fuel consumption� (MNRE, 2015b)� Finance, amounting to approximately 
USD 100 000 per city, is provided under the programme for developing the plan, identifying project sites and 
potential, and monitoring and promoting the deployment of renewable energy projects� By July 2014, 31 cities 
had been enlisted and had started the development of a master plan, while another 17 had got ‘in principle’ 
approval from the MNRE�

5.  RENEWABLE ENERGY POTENTIAL 
AND COSTS
Table  5  provides  an  overview  of  MNRE  and  other 
organisations’  estimates  of  the  technical  potential  for 
power generation in India� The country has an estimated 
renewable  energy  potential  of  about  900  GW  from 
commercially exploitable sources (1 000 GW when large 
hydropower is included)� It is endowed with very good 
solar  energy  potential�  Most  areas  receive  on  average 
between 4-7 kWh/m2/day of solar irradiance� Assuming 
3% of the country’s wasteland is available for it there is 
a solar power potential of 750 GW�
MNRE  estimates  the  annual  potential  for  biomass-
based  electricity  at  18  GW,  generated  by  120–150 
million  tonnes  of  agricultural  and  forestry  residues� 
There is also about 5 GW of possible power capacity 
from  bagasse-based  cogeneration  in  sugar  mills� 
Sugar  mills  represent  the  largest  share  of  industrial 
combined  heat  and  power  (CHP)  potential  in  the 
country,  equivalent  to  14  GW�  There  is  also  5  GW  of 
additional potential from energy crops, taking current 
total biomass power generation capacity potential to 
28 GW (MNRE, 2012; 2015c)�
The  potential  for  wind  is  more  differentiated�  The 
National  Wind  Resource  Assessment  programme 
monitored  794  sites  with  heights  ranging  from  20-
120  meters�  At  a  hub  height  of  80  metres,  there  is  at 
least 102�8 GW of potential at sites with a wind power 
density  greater  than  200  W/m2  (MNRE,  2012)�  Other 
studies show considerable more potential, ranging from 
300 GW to as much as 1000 GW (NIWE, n�d�)� India has 
a vast 7 600 km coastline and preliminary studies have 
indicated potential for deploying offshore wind power 
projects in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)�
The  potential  of  hydropower  –  small  and  large  –  is 
estimated  by  MNRE  to  be  20  GW  (based  on  6 474 
assessed  sites)  and  100  GW,  respectively�  The  IEA 
assesses  total  hydropower  potential  at  around  150  GW 
(IEA,  2011)�  According  to  an  IREDA  atlas  of  potential 
land for renewable energy assessment, there is 15 GW of 
potential for small hydropower for schemes up to 25 MW� 
The same assessment adds that the potential is actually 
much larger, as different states are offering sites for small 
hydropower for self-identification by prospective bidders�

than 2014 installed capacity for hydropower, wind and bioenergy. For solar its well over

Table  6  shows  a  breakdown  of  the  total  potential  of 
biomass  supply  in  2030  by  types�  IRENA  (2014c) 
estimated  the  biomass  supply  potential  and  related 
supply  costs  up  to  2030,  for  seven  types  of  biomass 
feedstocks (energy crops, harvesting residues, biomass 
residues,  biogas,  fuel  wood,  forest  residues,  and 
wood residues) for all REmap countries� By this estimate, 
India  can  expect  a  total  biomass  supply  potential 
in  2030  of  about  9  EJ�  More  than  80%  of  the  total 
originates from agricultural residues, with a significant 
contribution  from  biogas:  no  potential  for  dedicated 
energy crops was estimated� These estimates are also in

line with a study by Batidzirai et al� (2012) that reviews 
biomass supply estimates for India from key literature, 
though this provides a wide range depending on how 
the availability of land and residues is accounted for�
(<5  MW)  projects  having  weighted  average  costs  of 
USD 0�09/kWh� Biomass-fired power generation costs 
average between USD 0�045/kWh and USD 0�06/kWh, 
assuming  feedstock  costs  of  between  USD  1�3-2�5/GJ� 
The weighted average LCOE of utility-scale solar PV fell 
to around USD 0�06/kWh in early 2016 and in early 2017 
some PV auction have broken the USD 0�05/kWh mark, 
but there was still a wide range of costs, and projects 
with an LCOE of twice this average that are still being 
built�
IRENA  estimates  that  supply  costs  range  from 
USD  1-12/GJ�  The  lower  end  of  the  range  refers  to 
agricultural  residues  (harvesting  and  processing),  as 
well as to biogas, the higher end to forest products and 
residues, including fuelwood�
Wind, hydropower, biomass power and 
solar PV all compete with fossil fuel power 
generation, with increasingly renewable 
energy being the least-cost generation 
option
India has some of the world’s most competitive levelised 
costs  of  electricity  (LCOE),  even  for  wind,  where  the 
quality  of  the  local  resource  is  lower  than  in  other 
regions� Financing costs, however, are somewhat higher 
than in neighbouring countries like China, and this has 
an impact on the LCOE� Figure 17 gives an overview of 
ranges  and  weighted  averages  for  renewable  power 
technologies  commissioned  or  proposed  between 
2013  and  2015�  Hydropower  is  still  the  lowest-cost 
renewable  power  generation  option,  with  weighted 
average  costs  of  between  USD  0�04/kWh  and 
USD  0�05/kWh  for  small-  and  large-scale  projects, 
respectively�  Large-scale  wind  projects  have  average 
costs of around USD 0�08/kWh, with a range between 
USD  0�045/kWh  and  USD  0�11/kWh,  with  small-scale 
The  MNRE  has  also  provided  a  tentative  breakdown 
of  which  states  and  regions  will  experience  the 
deployment  of  renewable  energy  capacity  to  meet 
the  target  of  175  GW  by  2022  (Figure  18)�  It  shows 
that  over  half  of  the  100  GW  of  solar  power  will  be 
located in the Northern and Western Regions� Wind will 
predominantly be located in the Western and Southern 
Regions, while most regions will receive some bioenergy 
and small-hydropower�

6.  REFERENCE CASE DEVELOPMENTS 
FROM NOW UNTIL 2030
Key points
 ●
Total  renewable  energy  demand  in  end-use 
sectors (excluding renewable electricity) will see 
an increase from about 6�6 EJ/yr to 7�7 EJ/yr� In 
the  building  sector,  which  includes  residential, 
commercial  and  government  sub-sectors, 
developments  in  the  traditional  use  of  biomass 
are modest, with demand increasing from 4�1 EJ/
yr in 2010 to 4�3 EJ/yr� In the industrial sector, the 
only  renewable  energy  source  is  solid  biomass 
use for process heat generation: this will increase 
by  50%  from  1 200  PJ/yr  in  2010  to  1 800  PJ/yr 
by 2030� Fossil fuels still dominate, and coal use 
doubles� The transport sector sees more than a 
doubling in demand, from 2 400 PJ/yr to almost 
6 000  PJ/yr  by  2030,  almost  all  the  increase  is 
met by oil products�
 ●
India’s  TFEC  is  projected  to  increase  from 
17�4 EJ in 2010 to 42�6 EJ in 2030 in the Reference 
Case�  Energy  use  trends,  largely  based  on 
Planning  Commission  and  CEEW  estimates, 
show that its future energy demand will continue 
to be mainly reliant on fossil fuels�
 ●
Total  power  generation  is  expected  to  increase 
by  3�5  times  from  945  TWh/yr  in  2010  to  over 
3 450 TWh/yr by 2030� Some 2 000 TWh of the 
expected increase will be met by growth in coal 
power generation� Total gross power generation 
capacity  will  reach  an  estimated  670  GW  by 
2030�  Of  this  total,  40%  –  262  GW  installed 
capacity  –  will  be  related  to  renewable  power 
generation�
 ●
The  results  of  the  Reference  Case  show  that 
fossil  fuel  growth  largely  dominates  the  period 
up  to  2030�  While  the  growth  of  renewable 
power  generation  accelerates,  the  use  of  coal 
in industry, of natural gas in buildings, and of oil 
in transport results in a decrease in renewables’ 
overall  share,  particularly  in  the  buildings  and 
industry sectors�
 ●
Coal  power  capacity  will  reach  385  GW,  an 
increase  of  around  290  GW  over  2010  levels� 
Total  coal  demand  for  power  generation  will 
increase by a factor of 3�5, from around 8 EJ to 
just under 28 EJ in the Reference Case�
 ●
The  increased  renewable  power  capacity  in  the 
Reference Case is significant compared to historic 
trends,  but  still  low  compared  to  the  growth 
in  coal  power  capacity�  Installed  hydropower 
capacity will grow by around 25 GW to 48 GW, 
and  biomass  and  biogas  capacity  from  around 
3 GW to 11 GW in total� Wind power capacity will 
experience the greatest increase to reach 145 GW 
by 2030, compared to 14 GW in 2010� Solar PV 
will also see strong growth�
The REmap analysis of India begins with an assessment 
of the uptake of renewable energy technology options 
between  2010  and  2030,  based  on  current  policies� 
Planning Commission (GOI, 2014b) and CEEW (2015d) 
estimates  are  used  to  a  large  extent  to  develop  the 
Reference  Case  for  this  analysis,  though  IRENA 
estimates  are  employed  in  assessing  biomass  and 
LPG  use  in  the  building  sector  and  some  bioenergy 
technology breakdowns in the power sector, including 
off-grid power applications�
 ●
In total, the renewable energy share in TFEC will 
decrease from 40% to 23%, when traditional uses 
of biomass are included, and from 17% to 12% in 
terms  of  the  modern  renewable  energy,  which 
excludes  such  traditional  uses  in  the  building 
sector�
India’s  energy  use  has  been  growing  rapidly  and 
projections show that its TFEC is projected to increase 
from  17�4  EJ  in  2010  to  42�6  EJ  in  2030�  The  country 
needs  to  choose  how  this  growth  will  be  met�  This 
chapter  overviews  the  Reference  Case  energy  use

trends  in  India  between  2010  and  2030,  which  mainly 
rely on fossil fuels�
generation  from  solar  PV  will  increase  rapidly  from 
under 1 TWh/yr to 83 TWh/yr by 2030, while bioenergy 
power  (including  biogas)  grows  from  10  TWh/yr  to 
around 35 TWh/yr�
Between  2010  and  2030,  the  largest  increase  is  in 
natural gas, which grows 20 fold, fuelled by surging LPG 
imports� Oil demand doubles due to large increases in 
demand  from  transport  and  buildings�  Coal  use  also 
doubles  in  end-use  sectors,  while  biomass  use  grows 
slightly, by around 10%� The increases in natural gas and 
oil  are  driven  by  an  increase  in  economic  activity  and 
accelerated  urbanisation,  which  takes  the  number  of 
people living in cities and towns to 600 million by 2030� 
Urban  populations  consume  more  natural  gas  and  oil, 
and  –  importantly  in  India’s  case  –  significantly  more 
electricity� Though growth in end-use fuel consumption 
is  significant,  it  is  overshadowed  by  the  very  rapid 
increase in the consumption of electricity�
The total gross capacity of the power system will almost 
quadruple from 174 GW in 2010 to an estimated 670 GW 
by 2030� Coal power capacity will reach 385 GW in the 
Reference  Case,  an  increase  of  around  290  GW  over 
2010  levels  (Figure  20)�  Total  coal  demand  for  power 
generation  will  increase  by  a  factor  of  3�5  times  over, 
from around 8 EJ to just under 28 EJ� As discussed in 
Chapter 3, heavy reliance on coal will require significant 
imports  from  world  markets  as  domestic  supply  is 
limited  and  the  quality  of  Indian  coal  is  low  (with  a 
low heat rate)� Power generation capacity from oil and 
nuclear will experience very slight growth, and natural 
gas capacity will remain flat�
Total power generation is expected to increase 3�5 times 
over in the Reference Case from 945 TWh/yr in 2010 to 
over 3 450 TWh/yr by 2030� Some 2 000 TWh/yr of this 
extra 2 500 TWh/yr will be met by increases in coal power 
generation�  Renewable  power  generation,  meanwhile, 
is  projected  to  increase  from  about  137  TWh/yr  to 
595  TWh/yr  (Figure  19)�  Wind  energy  will  form  the 
largest component of this with around 345 TWh/yr in 
2030, followed by hydropower with 131 TWh/yr� Power 
Renewable  power  capacity  in  the  Reference  Case  is 
significant  compared  to  historic  trends,  but  still  low 
when  contrasted  with  the  growth  in  coal-fired  power� 
Installed  hydropower  capacity  will  grow  by  around 
25 GW to 48 GW, and biomass and biogas capacity will 
grow from around 3 GW to 11 GW in total� Wind power 
capacity  undergoes  the  greatest  growth  in  absolute 
terms  to  reach  145  GW  by  2030  from  14  GW  in  2010�

Solar PV grows even more proportionately, from under 
1 GW to 56 GW12 (of which 15 GW is distributed rooftop 
PV)�
7 700  PJ/yr  (Figure  21)�  In  the  building  sector,  which 
includes residential, commercial and public sub-sectors, 
the  traditional  use  of  biomass  only  increases  from 
4 100  PJ/yr  in  2010  to  4 300  PJ/yr,  a  very  modest 
increase compared to the doubling of the sector’s final 
energy demand� The doubling of the sector’s demand is 
largely driven by significant growth in LPG and natural 
gas  consumption�  The  increase  demand  for  modern 
forms  of  bioenergy  for  cooking  sees  limited  growth� 
Modern forms of solid biomass use increase by only 10% 
in  the  building  sector,  from  1 400  PJ/yr  to  1 500  PJ/yr, 
but  its  use  of  biogas,  though  low,  grows  more  than 
six-fold from 10 PJ/yr to 65 PJ/yr� The only other sizable 
renewable  source  is  solar  thermal,  which  increases 
12-fold to 72 PJ/yr by 2030, but from a very low 6 PJ/yr 
starting point�
In the Reference Case demand for coal for both heating 
and power generation grows significantly� To meet this 
demand, measures will be needed to accommodate such 
a  high  coal  demand�  Current  exploration  and  mining 
of  coal  needs  upgrading;  this,  along  with  increasing 
demand, will be a major challenge if no action is taken� 
Infrastructure for coal imports will be required on India’s 
western and southern coasts� Coal washing will need to 
become  the  norm  requiring  large  quantities  of  water, 
and the fuels environmental externalities will need to be 
internalised (IEA, 2011)� These investments could lock-in 
infrastructure  that  assure  the  country  consumes  large 
quantities of coal for decades to come�
In  the  industrial  sector,  the  only  sizable  source 
of  renewable  energy  is  solid  biomass  use  for  heat 
generation,  which  will  increase  by  50%  from  around 
1 200 PJ/yr in 2010 to 1 800 PJ/yr by 2030� Fossil fuels 
still  dominate:  coal  use  doubles  from  3 200  PJ/yr  to 
6 400  PJ/yr  by  2030,  as  does  oil  consumption,  from 
1 600 PJ/yr to 3 200 PJ/yr� The largest increase – from 
280 PJ/yr to just under 5 000 PJ/yr – is in natural gas�
Total  renewable  energy  demand  in  end-use  sectors 
(excluding  renewable  electricity)  will  increase  in 
the  Reference  Case  from  about  6 600  PJ/yr  to 
12  Solar PV growth in the Reference Case does not take into account 
the  recently-announced  goal  of  achieving  100  GW  by  2022, 
this  goal  is  considered  accelerated  renewable  uptake  and  is 
incorporated into the REmap Options

Energy use in the transport sector more than doubles 
from 2 400 PJ/yr to almost 6 000 PJ/yr by 2030� Petrol 
and  diesel  consumption  increases  from  2 100  PJ/yr  to 
5 600  PJ/yr,  with  a  small  additional  supply  of  liquid 
biofuel, largely based on biodiesel, increasing from 8 PJ/
yr to 109 PJ/yr: that may be more than a thirteen-fold 
increase,  but  it  still  only  provides  under  2%  of  the 
sector’s energy needs�
Table  7  gives  an  overview  of  the  Reference  Case’s 
change  in  the  share  of  renewables  (including  both 
modern  and  traditional  uses  of  bioenergy)  in  India’s 
TFEC  between  2010  and  2030�  The  share  of  modern 
renewable  energy  in  the  industry  and  buildings 
sectors  actually  falls,  due  to  large  increases  in  their 
consumption of coal (in industry) and natural gas (in 
buildings)�
In the end-use sectors only bioenergy 
sees growth among renewable sources in 
the Reference Case; significant growth is, 
however, seen in fossil fuel demand
Renewables’  share  in  the  power  sector  increases, 
however, from 14% to 18% in the same period – despite 
the high growth in coal power generation – as a result 
of  the  growth  in  solar  PV  and  wind  and,  to  a  lesser

growth in renewable energy due to a small increase in

social  and  environmental  impacts  and  so  need  to  be 
substituted with modern forms of renewables�
The  results  of  the  Reference  Case  show  that  fossil 
fuel growth largely dominates the period up to 2030� 
While  the  growth  of  renewable  power  generation 
accelerates,  the  use  of  coal  in  industry,  natural  gas 
in  the  building  sector,  and  oil  in  the  transport  sector 
results in a decrease in the overall share of renewables 
particularly  in  buildings  and  industry�  While  much 
attention should be paid to the significant increases in 
electricity  demand  and  the  opportunities  to  increase 
renewable  energy  deployment  in  the  power  sector, 
there is also a need to look at increasing the growth of 
renewables in the end-use sectors� It is clear from this 
Reference Case that India is at the start of a period of a 
very high increase in energy demand, and government 
plans currently envisage the vast majority of it as being 
met  by  fossil  fuels,  despite  little  potential  to  supply 
them from domestic sources� Greater attention should 
be  paid  to  meeting  this  demand  with  domestically 
produced  renewable  energy�  The  following  chapters 
will  address  this  challenge,  and  show  how  India  can 
achieve  significantly  higher  growth  in  renewable 
energy�
Even  though  the  share  of  electricity  in  India’s  TFEC  is 
up from 12% to 25%, and the share of renewable power 
slightly increases, this is overshadowed by the growth in 
end-use fuels� As a result, the renewable energy share 
in TFEC will decrease from 40% to 23% in the Reference 
Case, when traditional uses of biomass are included, and 
from 17% to 12% if viewed in terms of modern renewable 
energy  (which  excludes  traditional  uses  of  biomass  in 
the building sector)�
The  share  of  renewable  energy  in  India’s  TFEC  was 
around  39%  in  2012  –  split  into  10%  modern  and  29% 
traditional  forms  –  according  to  the  Global  Tracking 
Framework (GTF; World Bank, 2015)� The IRENA analysis 
for the REmap base year of 2010 shows a similar share 
for  total  renewable  energy  (40%)  but  a  higher  one, 
of  around  17%  for  modern  renewables  than  in  the 
GTF�  Yet  modern  renewables  are  still  less  than  half  of 
all  renewable  energy  consumed,  with  a  large  share 
still  coming  from  traditional  uses  of  biomass�  These 
traditional uses are not sustainable and have negative

7.  THE REMAP OPTIONS TO 2030
Key points
 ●
Options  have  been  identified  that  could  raise 
India’s  renewable  energy  use  to  approximately 
9�3  EJ  by  2030,  equivalent  to  a  25%  share  of 
TFEC� They include full substitution of traditional 
uses of biomass by modern renewables�
–  have  been  estimated  for  industry�  With  these 
additions in REmap, solar thermal would account 
for  about  0�7%  of  India’s  total  industrial  energy 
demand (excluding power)� In the building sector 
an  additional  125  million  m2  are  considered  as 
REmap Options� Most of this is for water heating, 
with  a  smaller  share  related  to  solar  cooling 
substituting  for  air  conditioning  systems�  The 
total  installed  solar  water  heating  capacity  in 
India’s  building  sector  would  increase  to  154 
million  m2,  delivering  370  PJ/yr,  2%  of  its  total 
energy demand�
 ●
Forty-two percent of the total renewable energy 
use  in  REmap  is  related  to  renewable  power 
options�  Various  forms  of  biomass  (such  as  for 
power, heat, and motor fuel) and solar (PV, CSP, 
solar  thermal  heating/cooling)  would  together 
account  for  80%  of  total  renewable  energy  use 
in 2030�
 ●
REmap estimates a trend towards more electricity 
use in the transport sector through the increased 
use  of  electric  vehicles  and  structural  changes� 
An  additional  100  TWh/yr  electricity  use  is 
estimated  for  electric  vehicles,  with  20  million 
four-wheel cars and as many as 350 million two 
to three wheelers on the road in 2030�
 ●
Of  the  REmap  Options  identified  in  the  power 
sector, 40% are related to solar PV, 20% to wind, 
16% to hydro and 11% to biomass� The remaining 
is  related  to  geothermal,  solar  CSP  and  rural 
electrification�
 ●
Total  wind  capacity  would  increase  14  times 
over  from  its  2010  level�  The  increase  in  solar 
PV  capacity  is  even  higher  and  would  reach 
an  installed  capacity  of  200  GW  by  2030  plus 
additional  off-grid  solar  PV,  more  than  double 
India’s  2022  target  of  100  GW�  Renewable 
power’s share of total capacity would increase to 
39% in the Reference Case, and 60% in REmap� 
India’s INDC pledged to reach a share of 40% by 
2030�
 ●
In  REmap  modern  renewable  energy’s  share  of 
India’s  TFEC  increases  to  25%  in  2030,  more 
than  double  the  Reference  Case  level  of  12%� 
Renewable  energy’s  share  in  power  generation 
increases  to  35%  in  REmap,  from  14%  in  2010, 
compared to 18% in the Reference Case�
 ●
The  energy  intensity  of  India’s  economy  was 
USD  6�9  per  MJ  in  2010  and  will  decrease  in 
the  Reference  Case  by  17%  to  USD  5�7  per  MJ 
in  2030�  In  REmap,  this  is  reduced  further  to 
USD  5�1  per  MJ,  a  decrease  of  26%  over  2010 
levels�
 ●
Primary  biomass  use  would  increase  20%  over 
2010  levels�  While  traditional  use  of  bioenergy 
would be fully substituted by 2030, total primary 
biomass  demand  for  its  modern  uses  would 
more  than  double  by  then�  Additional  potential 
for biomass use is concentrated in the industrial, 
power generation and transport sectors�
 ●
Investment  needs  to  rise  considerably�  The 
REmap  options  would  require  USD  26  billion 
in  additional  investment  per  year  in  renewable 
capacity, which – when added to the Reference 
Case investment need of USD 16 billion – would 
result in 42 billion of total investment needs for 
renewable  technologies  per  year  between  now 
and 2030�
 ●
Solar  thermal  heat  will  play  an  important  role� 
20  million  m2  of  low-temperature  solar  water 
heater capacity – and 12 million m2 of medium-
temperature  concentrating  solar  collectors 
5 9
 ●
Coal  demand  would  decrease  by  17%  over  the 
Reference  Case,  to  around  30  EJ/yr,  and  oil 
demand by 23% to 8 EJ/yr�
 ●
The  Reference  Case  for  the  period  between 
2010  and  2030  was  created�  The  results  of  this 
projection are explained in Section 6,
 ●
The  total  package  of  REmap  Options  identified 
would result in an incremental cost of substitution 
of  USD  2�3  per  GJ  for  consumers  and  result 
in  additional  costs  of  USD  3�8/GJ  for  society, 
making  a  total  of  USD  17  billion  per  year  in 
additional costs� These exclude savings from the 
benefits  of  renewable  energy  from  improved 
human health and reduced CO2 emissions�
 ●
Commodities  and  fuel  prices  reflecting  the 
national situation were prepared;
 ●
Technology  cost  and  performance  criteria  (e�g� 
capacity  factors)  were  also  prepared  to  reflect 
the national situation and
 ●
Additional renewable energy options for all end-
use sectors and the power sector were analysed, 
based on various studies and assessments�
 ●
These  USD  17  billion  total  system  costs  would 
be  outweighed  by  estimated  savings  from  the 
effects  of  reducing  air  pollution,  which  amount 
to  USD  46-161/yr,  and  from  a  reduction  of 
750  Mt  of  CO2  emissions  per  year  by  2030, 
saving USD 13-63/yr� Most of the savings related 
to  air  pollution  are  associated  with  the  effects 
of  traditional  uses  of  biomass  in  the  residential 
sector�
The  sources  of  the  REmap  Options  for  India  originate 
from a range of research that includes:
 ●
For the power sector: The Planning Commission 
(GOI,  2014b)  and  Global  Change  Assessment 
Model  (GCAM)  estimates  of  the  CEEW  (2015d) 
were  used,  as  well  as  internal  assessments 
prepared by IRENA with input from MNRE� The 
Reference Case is broadly based on the Baseline 
Inclusive  Growth  Scenario,  while  the  REmap 
Options  are  largely  based  on  the  Low  Carbon 
Inclusive Growth scenario;
 ●
The  REmap  Options  would  also  have  positive 
macroeconomic  benefits  for  India  across  the 
board, resulting in higher GDP and significant net 
employment effects�
The Reference Case (i�e� business as usual) analysis for 
India uses an internally developed REmap tool� The data, 
assumptions  and  approach  used  were  summarised  in 
Chapter  2  while  the  results  of  the  Reference  Case  are 
detailed in Chapter 6� Under the Reference Case, India 
is  expected  to  experience  a  very  significant  growth  in 
energy  demand,  in  the  order  of  around  a  two  and  a 
half  times  increase�  Importantly  most  of  this  growth 
is  to  be  met  by  fossil  fuels,  and  the  overall  share  of 
renewables actually decreases, despite a slight increase 
in the use of renewable power� So it is important to see 
where  additional  renewable  potential  is  available,  and 
IRENA  uses  the  REmap  tool  to  input  this  in  the  form 
of additional renewable energy options in the end-use 
sectors of industry, buildings, and transport, as well as 
for power and district heat generation� The process for 
identifying the REmap Options was as follows:
 ●
For the heating (buildings and industry) sector: 
Solar  Water  Heaters  in  India  (GOI,  2010)  and 
a  recent  IRENA  renewable  energy  in  industry 
roadmap (IRENA, 2014b) with its accompanying 
data were used; and
 ●
For the transport sector: A variety of sources were 
used,  including  CEEW  (2015d),  IRENA  analysis, 
the  Planning  Commission  (GOI,  2014b),  Vision 
2020  –  A  Blueprint  for  Railway  Electrification 
Programme (GOI, 2011), and the National Electric 
Mobility Mission Plan 2020 (GOI, 2012)�
In  addition,  expert  opinions  from  MNRE,  IRENA  and 
external authorities were incorporated into the analysis 
to  arrive  at  renewable  potential�  These  were  primarily 
the  source  of  some  biomass,  off-grid  and  renewable 
power technology assessments�

7�1  Renewable energy 
technologies in the power 
sector
REmap  Options  can  potentially  take  the  installed 
capacity  of  on-grid  solar  PV  to  200  GW  and  higher 
if  including  additional  off-grid  systems�  This  is  over 
four  times  higher  than  is  envisioned  in  the  Reference 
Case,  which  assumes  achieving  20  GW  by  2022,  and 
an installation rate of just over 3 GW/yr between then 
and 2030 to have 48 GW by that time� REmap Options 
include  the  recently  proposed  target  of  100  GW  by 
2022  (as  this  constitutes  an  accelerated  approach 
for  renewables  this  is  included  in  the  REmap  case)� 
Achieving  the  REmap  total  of  200  GW  would  require 
an  annual  installation  rate  of  1  GW/yr  from  the  2014 
level until 2022 and 15 GW/yr between then and 2030� 
Utility-scale solar accounts for 160 GW, and distributed 
generation – including grid-connected rooftop, for the 
remainder� An additional 20 GW of solar home systems 
and solar for telecom towers would also be in operation�
The  Reference  Case  showed  modest  developments  in 
the  power  generation  sector  with  a  slight  increase  in 
the renewable share from 14% to 18%� There is significant 
growth  in  renewable  power  generation  capacity 
(particularly  wind,  but  also  solar),  but  total  demand 
for power in India grows equally fast, resulting in only 
relatively small increases in the sector’s total renewable 
energy  share  between  2010  and  2030�  The  share  of 
renewable  power  capacity  reaches  39%  of  capacity  in 
the Reference Case, just shy of the 40% INDC target� In 
fact,  the  fivefold  increase  in  power  demand  creates  a 
significant opportunity to realise India’s large potential 
for renewables, and this needs to be considered� Figure 
22  shows  the  change  in  renewable  power  generation 
capacities  between  2010  and  2030,  if  the  realisable 
potential  of  all  renewable  energy  technologies  waste 
is deployed beyond the Reference Case� In REmap the 
renewable  share  of  capacity  increases  considerably, 
to 60%� The rest of this section explains this potential, 
technology by technology�
Solar PV has a capacity factor ranging from 16% to 19% 
and  is  estimated  to  produce  around  350  TWh/yr  of 
power, making up around 10% of India’s power supply� 
So the impact of this addition on the grid will be limited 
(see  Chapter  8  for  a  more  detailed  grid  discussion)� 
6 1
Wind
This  share  is  an  increase  from  nearly  zero  at  present, 
and represents significantly higher growth even greater 
than the very big increase expected in total demand for 
electricity�
The  capacity  of  onshore  wind  in  2030  increases  from 
145 GW in the Reference Case to 185 GW in REmap� The 
Reference  Case  assumes  reaching  a  60  GW  target  by 
2022,  and  continued  growth  until  2030  with  145  GW 
installed  wind  power,  resulting  in  just  under  8  GW 
of  capacity  additions  per  year  on  average  between 
2015  and  2030�  Recent  wind  capacity  installations 
have averaged 2 GW per year, but rates have reached 
3  GW/yr  in  several  recent  years,  showing  that  more  is 
possible�  Realising  the  potential  identified  in  REmap 
would require a significant increase over recent trends� 
REmap also assumes a limited growth in offshore wind, 
from just under 0�5 GW in the Reference Case to 3 GW� 
Total wind power generation would amount to 470 TWh, 
or  just  above  13%  of  total  electricity  supply�  Together 
wind with solar PV would represent approximately 21% 
of the total power generation in India�
Rooftops in densely populated cities are an important 
element  in  the  availability  of  space  for  solar  PV  and 
thermal  systems�  By  2030  around  40%  of  buildings 
would have either a solar thermal or solar PV system on 
their roofs� The estimate is based on the availability of 
rooftops in New Delhi: at present they amount to around 
31 km2, which could take an estimated 2�5 GW of solar PV 
modules (Greenpeace, 2013)� As Delhi makes up around 
1%  of  India’s  total  population,  the  total  Indian  rooftop 
potential may be around 250 GW� If it is assumed that 
there is around 50 GW of distributed rooftop solar PV 
(including solar home systems), around 20% of India’s 
available  rooftop  area  would  have  a  solar  PV  system 
in  2030�  With  around  150  million  m2  of  solar  thermal 
residential and commercial systems, an estimated 20% 
of buildings would have them�
Bioenergy
Besides this very significant growth in solar PV, REmap 
assumes  an  addition  of  10  GW  of  solar  CSP�  The 
Reference  Case  assumes  that  there  will  be  none  of 
it�  So,  though  a  growth  to  10  GW  may  seem  modest 
compared to the increase in PV, it still implies building 
20-50  large  CSP  plants  within  the  next  15  years�  The 
CSP plants included in REmap for 2030 have capacity 
factors  up  to  30%  but  no  storage:  though  many  CSP 
plants which include storage are being planned around 
the world, they result in higher costs� Besides, the fact 
that the increasing electricity demand in India is partly 
being driven by demand for cooling means the mid-day 
and afternoon peak load requirements fit well with CSP 
production,  thereby  reducing  the  incentive  to  build 
storage  into  them–  at  least  before  2030�  CSP  plants 
commissioned  in  Rajasthan  achieved  capacity  factors 
ranging  between  19%  and  26%  in  2014�  Gujarat  and 
Maharashtra in the west of India, Jammu and Kashmir, 
Himachal  Pradesh  and  Uttarakhand  in  the  north,  and 
Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in the south 
–  as  well  as  Rajasthan  –  are  favourable  locations  with 
high  direct  solar  radiation�  The  analysis  assumes  that 
the  CSP  plants  are  built  in  regions  that  ensure  higher 
capacity factors than are presently achieved�
Bioenergy used for electricity is differentiated in detail� 
In  broad  terms,  the  additions  taking  place  in  REmap 
are a mix of technologies that include 4 GW of biomass 
co-firing  in  coal  power  plants,  4  GW  of  solid  biomass 
residue-fired CHP biomass plants in industry, 2 GW of 
gasifiers  used  in  urban  and  rural  applications,  2  GW 
of  power-alone  biomass  fired  power  plants,  3  GW 
of  waste-to-power  systems,  and  0�2  of  GW  off-grid 
biogas�  REmap  biomass  use  estimates  are  based  on 
an  overview  of  the  assessments  of  potential  prepared 
by the MNRE and other sources� Assumptions for each 
technology are discussed below�
 ●
REmap  assumes  that  around  4  GW  additional 
power capacity from combustion of solid biomass 
in  power-alone  and  co-firing  –  mostly  in  plants 
that at present burn coal – is added to this total� 
So just over 1% of the total coal power capacity 
of 310 GW still present in REmap, would be used 
to co-combust biomass for power production�
 ●
For  power-alone  solid  biomass  combustion 
systems,  MNRE  estimates  a  total  potential 
of  about  23  GW,  split  between  18  GW  from 
agricultural/forestry  residues  and  5  GW  from 
energy crops� Yet IRENA’s internal assessment of 
biomass  supplies  includes  no  dedicated  energy 
crops,  so  it  is  assumed  that  none  of  the  5  GW 
6 2
capacity  would  be  deployed  by  2030�  Based 
on  today’s  residue  generation  factors,  REmap 
assumes reaching 10 GW of the 18 GW potential 
(compared to 1 GW in 2010/2011)�
in  2030�  Another  4  GW  is  assumed  for  non-
bagasse-fired  capacity  which  results  in  a  2030 
total of 8�6 GW�
Hydropower
 ●
For waste-to-power systems, there is an estimate 
of  about  4  GW  potential�  This  is  3GW  higher 
than the 1 GW in the Reference Case since waste 
generation  potential  will  increase  along  with 
growth in population and the economy�
its 
India  has 
large 
limited  potential  to  expand 
hydropower  capacity�  In  2015  around  42  GW  total 
hydropower  capacity  was  in  operation,  with  around 
10% of it considered medium and small hydropower� The 
Reference Case envisions increasing the total installed 
capacity  by  11  GW,  mostly  in  large  hydropower�  Based 
on  the  Planning  Commission’s  Low  Carbon,  Inclusive 
Growth (LCIG) scenario, capacity will increase to around 
77 GW in REmap, with a significant acceleration of small 
hydropower  systems�  Total  hydropower  generation 
will  reach  246  TWh/yr,  the  third  biggest  renewable 
source  after  wind  and  solar  PV�  However,  realising 
such  a  large  increase  in  hydropower  capacity  would 
present  difficulties�  According  to  GlobalData  (2016), 
17  GW  of  hydropower  capacity  is  under  construction 
with  an  additional  2  GW  in  the  financing  phase� 
REmap  would  require  this  to  almost  double,  with  an 
additional 14 GW constructed� An estimated 50 GW is 
undergoing consideration and review for permitting in 
India�  Considering  the  long  permitting,  planning  and 
construction periods of many hydropower plants, many 
of these will not be built by 2030, but, a large number of 
projects are clearly being considered�
 ●
For  co-generation  in  industry,  in  2010/2011,  the 
total  installed  cogeneration  capacity  in  India’s 
sugar mills was about 1�9 GW (electric-capacity), 
generating  about  6  TWh/yr,  based  on  a  35% 
capacity factor (based on mills in Uttar Pradesh, 
and considering both on-season and off-season)� 
This is equivalent to total generation of 85 kWh 
per tonne of bagasse�
 ●
India produces approximately 80 Mt wet bagasse 
with  a  lower  heating  value  of  approximately 
7-8  MJ/kg)  each  year,  about  70  Mt  of  which  is 
used  for  captive  power  generation�13  According 
to Vision 2030 for the sugar industry, total sugar 
cane production will grow to 520 Mt/yr� by 2030 
and would generate a total volume of 120 Mt wet 
bagasse  per  year�  Based  on  today’s  level  of  wet 
bagasse use for power cogeneration (70 Mt out of 
80 Mt), this provides the potential to install 5�1 GW 
in power capacity (at slightly improved efficiency 
levels  and  using  100  Mt/yr  wet  bagasse)  in  the 
Reference Case� The Reference Case assumes an 
additional 1 GW biomass-fired (non-bagasse) CHP 
capacity for distilleries, dairies and rice mills, which 
today  have  a  combined  CHP  potential  of  4  GW 
(Singh,  Singh  and  Mahla,  2013),  rising  to  about 
8 GW by 2030 since total Indian industrial energy 
use will by then have doubled since 2010�
Renewable off-grid and electrification
In  2030,  an  estimated  1 485  million  people  will  live  in 
India,  59%  them  in  rural  areas�  This  compares  to  71% 
in 2005 when India’s total population was 1 131 million� 
At that time 55% of the rural population had access to 
electricity,  but  electrification  had  increased  to  around 
75% of the total population by 2014� The Reference Case 
gives a gap to be closed of 240 million people by 2030 
(assuming a 95% rate of electrification), whereas REmap 
– assuming 98% electrification – puts it a 280 million�
 ●
In  Remap,  the  efficiency  of  bagasse-fired  CHP 
plants is twice today’s levels, but less bagasse is 
available because some of it is used in producing 
advanced  biofuels�  This  results  in  4�6  GW 
bagasse-based  power  generation  capacity 
Electrification  is  possible  either  by  grid-connection  or 
off-grid  systems�  In  the  Reference  Case,  it  is  assumed 
that up to one-third of total rural electrification needs 
(related  to  household  demand)  can  be  met  by  off-
grid/mini-grid  systems�  Assuming  a  total  demand  of 
100  kWh  of  electricity  in  households  of  5  people,  the 
total needs of rural areas at present without access to 
power  is  equivalent  to  8  TWh/yr,  of  which  2�6  TWh/
13  Information about total heat production from cogeneration plants 
is  limited�  One  source  states  that  it  is  around  110  PJ  per  year 
(power-to-heat ratio of 0�2) but that, in actuality, it is likely to be 
lower  (ISMA,  n�d�)�  So  an  order  of  150  compared  to  total  power 
generation (so a power-to-heat ratio of about 0�15) is assumed�
6 3
yr  would  be  supplied  by  renewable  energy  off-grid 
systems� It is assumed that half of this can be supplied 
by solar home systems (1 GW, with a capacity factor of 
1 300 hours/yr), 40% by biomass systems that include 
gasifiers  and  biomethanisation  (0�4  GW,  both  with  a 
capacity  factor  of  3 100  hours/yr),  and  the  remaining 
10% by wind (0�13 GW, capacity factor of 2 000 hours/
yr)� With such developments, a total of 1�5 GW off-grid 
capacity would be installed in India by 2030, compared 
to  today’s  level  of  about  120  MW�  Biomass  gasifiers 
also play a role in urban areas (0�9 GW), particularly in 
industrial systems�
REmap biomass fuel demand for CHP15 heat increases 
by 320 PJ/yr�
Estimates  of  biogas  and  biomass  gasification  are 
based  on  IRENA’s  manufacturing  industry  report 
(IRENA, 2014b) to increase from 25 PJ/yr in the Reference 
Case to 250 PJ/yr in REmap� No additional solid biomass 
use is estimated beyond the Reference Case for heat-
only process systems in India’s manufacturing industry� 
Total  traditional  and  modern  uses  of  biomass  in  the 
building sector increase only slightly by 10%, while the 
sector’s  total  demand  for  fuel  doubles  between  2010 
and 2030� A considerable share of the total traditional 
uses of biomass is substituted with LPG/kerosene and 
natural  gas  in  the  Reference  Case�  Remap  assumes 
full substitution of traditional uses of biomass through 
a  mix  of  modern  biomass  technologies  and  solar 
cookers�  Gasifiers  and  biogas  plants,  already  used  in 
large amounts, would account for 45% of total modern 
biomass  needs  (at  about  30%  conversion  efficiency), 
while another half would come from solid biomass use 
in  modern  cookstoves  (at  25%  conversion  efficiency)� 
In  total,  REmap  assumes  that  around  1 500  PJ/yr  of 
modern  biomass  and  biogas  would  be  required  to 
meet the cooking needs provided by the 4 200 PJ/yr of 
traditional biomass still used in the Reference Case� This 
shift to modern forms of biomass cooking would result 
in a 2 700 PJ/yr reduction of biomass use the building 
sector�
For  REmap,  virtually  full  power  access  is  assumed, 
raising total power needs to 8�4 TWh/yr� It is assumed 
that up to two-thirds of this total demand would be met 
by off-grid/mini-grid systems with biomass gasifier and 
biomethanisation accounting for 40% of them (0�7 GW 
installed capacity), solar home systems 35% (1�5 GW in 
total) and wind 25% (0�7 GW)�
Solar  systems  can  also  play  a  role  in  the  growing 
number of telecom towers in India� There are now about 
740 000 of them, 70% in areas with less than 16 hours’ 
grid supply a day� Many are entirely powered by diesel 
generators� By 2020, the number of towers is expected 
to increase by at least a third to just under one million� 
Already 5�1 billion litres of diesel is consumed annually to 
ensure continuous power supplies: by 2030 this could 
reach about 8 billion litres per year, generating about 30 
TWh of electricity� About 70% of the towers’ total power 
needs in 2030 could be met with 13 GW of off-grid solar 
systems, with capacity factor of about 1 750 hours/yr�
A  total  of  5�4  billion  litres  of  ethanol  (30%  advanced, 
70%  conventional)  and  8  billion  litres  of  biodiesel 
was  assumed  for  the  transport  sector  in  REmap�  The 
Reference  case  also  sees  a  strong,  if  smaller,  growth 
of approximately 5 billion litres of ethanol and around 
2 billion litres of biodiesel� In total, transport sector liquid 
biofuel  demand  reaches  20�5  billion  litres  (or  470  PJ) 
representing  13%  of  the  sector’s  total  energy  demand 
in REmap�
7�2  Renewable energy 
technologies in the 
end-use sectors
Bioenergy for heating and transport fuel
With all these additions in various biomass technologies, 
India’s  total  primary  biomass  demand  reaches  8�1  EJ 
(see Figure 23) in REmap compared to approximately 
6�8 EJ in 2010, but is higher at 8�2 EJ in the Reference 
Case�  The  decrease  from  the  Reference  Case  total 
is  due  to  replacing  traditional  uses  of  biomass  with 
REmap  Options  include  various  biomass  technology 
options  for  heating,  cooking  and  transport  as  well 
as  solar  thermal  and  electricity-based  alternatives  to 
thermal systems� The various forms of bioenergy make 
up the largest type of fuel used in end-use sectors�14 In 
15  This estimate of biomass use for industrial process heating is based 
on energy allocation of total fuel input to CHPs and their power 
and heat output�
14  The  biomass  used  for  industrial  CHP  is  estimated  based  on  the 
total CHP generation explained in the bioenergy power section�

modern, more efficient alternatives� Demand for heating 
in  buildings  and  industry  would  account  for  three-
quarters of the total, with the remaining quarter divided 
between  transport  fuels  and  power  generation�  Total 
biomass demand in REmap would be 94% of the total 
8�6 EJ supply potential of biomass in India in 2030 (the 
total is based on IRENA’s bioenergy supply assessment 
(IRENA, 2014c))
conditioning systems� Their capacity factors, at between 
10% and 12%, are somewhat lower than those of industrial 
systems�  Added  to  installed  capacity  of  29  million  m2 
solar thermal capacity in the Reference Case, this would 
increase the total installed solar water heating capacity 
in India’s building sector to 154 million m2, or 2% of its 
total energy demand�
Electrification in the transport sector
in  REmap  assumes  an  additional 
Solar  thermal 
30  million  m2  of  low-temperature  solar  water  heater 
capacity  for  process  heat  in  industry,  along  with 
an  additional  12  million  m2  of  medium-temperature 
concentrating  solar  collectors�  The  concentrating 
systems  operate  with  capacity  factors  around  20%: 
for solar water heaters it is 13%� Solar thermal heating 
would therefore grow considerably from just 0�2 million 
m2 in the Reference Case� With REmap’s additions, solar 
thermal would account for about 0�7% of manufacturing 
industry’s  total  energy  demand  (excluding  power)  in 
India�
REmap shows a trend towards more use of electricity 
in transport, through increasing use of electric vehicles, 
as  well  as  structural  changes  or  so-called  modal  shift� 
An  additional  100  TWh/yr  is  estimated  for  electric 
vehicles – made up of four-wheel passenger cars (40% 
of the total additional demand), public vehicles (30%) 
and two-wheelers (30%)� This would increase the total 
electricity  demand  of  the  transport  sector  by  150%  in 
2030, compared to the Reference Case�
Modal shifts to city trams from passenger road vehicles, 
and to high speed trains from aviation contribute further 
to the electrification of the transport sector and result in 
60 TWh/yr extra electricity demand� The full 160 TWh/yr 
in additional demand is assumed to be supplied by new 
renewable  power  generation  capacity,  shared  equally 
by  new  hydropower  and  solar  PV�  Electric  vehicle 
Remap  Options  also  estimate  much  higher  capacity 
additions  -125  million  m2  –  on  top  of  the  Reference 
Case  for  the  buildings  and  services  sector  (including 
hotels)� The majority of this is for water heating with a 
smaller share related to solar cooling substituting for air

two-to-three-wheelers, 18% by four-wheel automobiles, 
and 18% by public bus and mini-bus� The REmap options 
also assume a 30% penetration of battery electric two-
to-three-wheelers,  20%  of  four-wheel  battery  electric 
vehicles (BEV) and 18% of public electric buses�
7�3  Renewable energy capacity 
deployment and shares
Figure  24  shows  the  increases  in  renewable  energy  in 
TFEC for grouped renewable energy resources between 
2010 and 2030, showing the growth occurring in both 
the  Reference  Case  and  REmap  Options,  and  sheds 
light  on  the  relative  importance  of  each  resource� 
Biomass use does not increase in REmap, as a result of 
substitution  for  its  traditional  uses,  but  it  still  remains 
the most important form of renewables in final energy 
terms� Solar energy experiences the largest percentage 
growth, because of significant growth in solar PV, as well 
as solar thermal systems in industry and buildings� Wind 
energy is the third largest source, but can only be used 
to produce power� It already experiences considerable 
growth  in  the  Reference  Case,  so  additions  from  the 
REmap  Options  are  more  limited�  Hydropower  is  the 
fourth largest contributor, followed by minor additions 
of geothermal power�
The Reference Case estimates 2 million electric vehicles 
to be in operation, 80% of them electric two-to-three- 
wheelers�  In  REmap  this  number  increases  greatly  to 
350  million,  of  which  over  90%  are  assumed  to  be 
electric two-to-three-wheelers, with around 20 million 
passenger four-wheelers and buses�
Geothermal energy
India’s geothermal potential is very limited� The Reference 
Case envisages no addition of geothermal power, and a 
small  share  of  geothermal  heat,  used  largely  in  the 
building  sector�  The  REmap  Options  assume  a  modest 
increase  in  geothermal  power,  based  on  assessments 
from  CEEW’s  (2015d)  GCAM�  In  total  a  capacity  of 
around 2 GW, producing 16 TWh of electricity, could be 
in operation by 2030� There is also an assumption of a 
small amount of additional geothermal heat in industry 
based on an IRENA assessment for renewable energy in 
manufacturing (2014b)�
Figure  25  shows  the  breakdown  of  renewable  energy 
use  by  consuming  sector  in  2010  and  under  REmap� 
Biomass  changes  significantly,  as  its  traditional  use  in 
the building sector is replaced with modern alternatives� 
Growth in biomass use is largely in the form of biofuels 
and residue combustion for CHP in industry�

The other changes include a significant increase in solar 
thermal heating and solar PV power generation in both 
the building and industrial sectors� Solar PV and wind 
become  the  largest  renewable  sources  of  electricity, 
followed  by  hydropower�  They  achieve  a  significant 
share in India’s final renewable energy use from nearly 
zero today� Biomass, but in modern forms, continues to 
dominate India’s 9�3 EJ of total renewable energy use in 
REmap in final energy terms, accounting for two-thirds 
of it�
is  explained  by  the  equally  fast-growing  TFEC  of  the 
sector as India becomes a more industrialised country�
The  share  of  renewable  energy  in  transport  shows  a 
significant increase from negligible in 2010 and only 2% 
in the Reference Case� In REmap 13% of transport fuel 
comes from biofuel, and the share climbs to 16% when 
renewable electricity is included�
The  building  sector’s  modern  renewable  energy  share 
almost  doubles  to  39%  in  REmap  from  21%  in  2010, 
driven by the modern use of biomass and solar thermal�
Of the 9�3 EJ of renewable energy consumed in REmap, 
approximately a third is electricity, up from 4% in 2010� 
About  another  third  is  fuel  consumed  in  the  building 
sector,  largely  for  cooking  –  mostly  modern  forms  of 
biomass but also some solar thermal heat� Most of the 
remaining third is biomass used in the industry sector 
for heating, with a small contribution from solar thermal 
and  geothermal  heat�  Heating  continues  to  be  the 
largest market in REmap with a total 59% share and the 
use of biofuel in the transport sector makes up around 
5% of renewable energy use compared to less than 1% 
in 2010� Transport fuels reach a 5% share compared to 
less than 1% in 2010�
Table  9  overviews  development  in  physical  terms 
between  2010  and  2030,  showing  how  renewable 
capacity  would  increase  from  just  above  50  GW  in 
2010 to over 520 GW in REmap, with a similar increase 
in  power  generation  from  renewables�  The  table  also 
shows  how  direct  uses  of  renewable  energy  –  i�e� 
energy  sourced  from  renewables  for  heating,  cooling 
and  transport  fuels  –  significantly  increase�  A  more 
detailed table showing a higher resolution of technology 
deployment,  including  rural  and  off-grid  systems,  is 
available in Annex F, including notes that describe some 
of the assumptions used to arrive at the REmap Options�
With  all  these  developments,  the  share  of  modern 
renewable  energy  shares  in  India’s  TFEC  increases  to 
25% in REmap, more than double the 2030 Reference 
Case  level  of  12%�  Renewable  energy’s  share  in  power 
generation  increases  to  35%  in  REmap,  from  14%  in 
2010, compared to 18% in the Reference Case� Despite 
an  increasing  amount  of  biomass  and  solar  thermal 
being  used  in  industry,  the  sector’s  renewable  energy 
share  remains  at  around  2010  levels  in  REmap:  this

Based on IRENA estimates
cost  and  potential  curve,  and  ranks  them  for  cost-
effectiveness� The cost-supply curve is an approximate 
representation  of  the  realistic  potential  of  renewable 
energy technologies – the REmap Options – which can 
be deployed by 2030 in addition to the Reference Case� 
The cost supply curve has not been used to develop the 
REmap, but is a representation of the REmap Options 
selected� This portfolio is not an allocation of the global 
6 9
additional potential based on the GDP of India and other 
REmap countries, nor does it represent extrapolations� 
Further technology portfolios can be generated, based 
on  different  understanding  of  the  parameters  that 
constitute REmap Options or other studies specifically 
looking at India�
technologies,  including  power  generation,  heating, 
cooking and transport�
Substitution costs differ greatly by sector� They are cost-
competitive in the building sector from both a business 
and  government  perspective,  with  a  substitution 
cost  of  USD  -5/GJ  to  USD-7/GJ,  driven  largely  by  the 
economics  of  replacing  traditional  uses  of  biomass 
with  modern  renewable  energy�  The  transport  sector 
has  a  very  low  incremental  cost  of  USD  1�5/GJ  from 
the business perspective, due to the effect of taxation 
on transport fuels, but increases to USD 6/GJ from the 
government perspective when these taxes are removed� 
The industrial sector has a narrow range of costs, from 
USD  2�5-3�0/GJ  from  the  business  and  government 
perspectives,  respectively,  as  a  result  of  relatively  low 
taxation  on  fuels  used  in  industry�  The  power  sector 
has  the  highest  average  cost  of  substitution  at  USD 
6/GJ  from  the  business  perspective  and  USD  8/GJ 
from  the  government  perspective,  largely  due  to  the 
substitution of coal� However, all costs presented here 
exclude  any  external  cost  reductions  arising  from  the 
REmap Options�
Figure  26  and  Figure  27  present  two  curves:  the  first 
is  based  on  the  business  perspective,  incorporating 
the  local  cost  of  capital  (at  a  10%  discount  rate), 
commodity  prices  (including  local  taxes  or  subsidies), 
the  technology  cost  and  performance  characteristics: 
the  second  takes  a  governmental  perspective  based 
on standard international commodity costs and a fixed 
10% discount rate� The former reflects factors likely to 
influence private investment decisions; the latter factors 
more  relevant  to  government  decisions  on  policy  and 
spending�  Decision  makers  will  be  tempted  to  pick 
low-cost options, from the left end of the curve, and skip 
high cost options on the right side, but the figure gives 
a  perspective  of  the  entire  country�  Decision  makers 
may  assume  that  options  represented  by  individual 
blocks in the supply curve are homogenous in terms of 
substitution  costs,  but  the  blocks  represent  averages 
based on the assumed deployments in the REmap�
Viewed  on  a  technology  level  the  cost  supply  curves 
give  perspective  on  the  competitiveness  of  individual 
renewable energy technologies compared to incumbent 
conventional  ones�  The  substitution  cost  method  and 
costs presented in the curves do not, however, take into 
account some factors than can influence costs, such as 
externalities relating to air pollution and climate change 
(which  generally  benefit  renewable  technologies),  or 
some  system-related  costs  associated  with  deploying 
either variable form of renewable power, or deployment 
and  learning  needs  that  may  be  required  if  local 
communities are to experience a significant amount of 
end-use  renewable  technologies�  These  costs  are  not 
limited  to  renewables,  but  tend  to  be  prevalent  when 
new technologies are entering the market�
The  curve  should  not  be  misinterpreted  as  a  series 
of  steps  from  left  to  right,  in  order  of  costs  that  can 
be  chosen  or  avoided  in  isolation�  In  fact,  there  are 
synergies and interactions: all of these options need to 
be  exercised  together  to  achieve  these  levels  of  costs 
and  their  indicated  renewable  energy  shares�  Some 
options,  for  example,  produce  savings  or  efficiency 
improvements  that  help  reduce  the  costs  of  more 
expensive  ones�  Focusing  on  the  cheapest  individual 
options  will  not  result  in  the  least  expensive  overall 
transition� That requires a holistic approach� And neither 
curve includes the benefits relating to improved human 
health or a better local environment that results from an 
increased deployment of renewables�
Looking  at  some  individual  technology  options,  it  is 
easy to focus on the left end of the curves� Here low-
hanging fruit include technologies that are competitive 
without  further  consideration  of  external  costs,  such 
as  solar  thermal  use  for  water  heating  in  buildings� 
Inexpensive  thermosiphon  solar  thermal  systems 
can  be  used  on  many  dwellings  and  –  since  there 
is  a  trend  of  increasingly  using  electricity  for  water 
heating  in  India  –  these  systems  are  very  competitive 
is  another 
by  comparison�  Biogas  for  cooking 
from  a  business  perspective, 
Observed 
the 
average  cost  of  substitution  with  Remap  Options  is 
USD 2�3/GJ of final energy� Viewed from the perspective 
of  governments,  this  cost  increases  to  USD  3�8/GJ  of 
final energy� To put them in perspective, they represent 
around  USD  8-11/MWh  in  additional  cost  if  the  entire 
portfolio of technologies is deployed� The costs would 
be borne across the entire energy system, by all energy 
services  that  are  impacted  by  the  renewable  energy

competitive option� If programmes are able to support 
the  development  of  biogas  systems,  using  anaerobic 
digestion,  this  competes  well  on  cost  both  with  LPG 
and with India’s considerable use of traditional biomass 
in inefficient cookstoves Other technologies that fall in 
the  competitive  or  near-competitive  substitution  cost 
range  (negative  to  slightly  positive)  include  biomass 
and  biogas  applications  in  industry�  Biogas  produced 
either  from  anaerobic  digestion  or  fixed  bed  gasifiers 
is  generally  competitive,  and  biomass  residues  used 
for process heat or produced in CHP systems are also 
attractive, though cost slightly more than coal or natural 
gas alternatives�
in savings� When on-grid is compared to the wholesale 
price  of  generation,  it  is  positive,  but  would  result  in 
slight savings compared to retail electricity rates�
When considering costs and benefits, it is important to 
look beyond the technology substitution costs presented 
in Figure 26 and Figure 27 since, as Table 10: Financial 
indicators  for  shows,  renewables  provide  important 
benefits  to  society�  There  would,  be  an  incremental 
energy  system  cost  of  USD  17  billion  per  year,  driven 
by  positive  substitution  costs�  Accounting  for  benefits 
resulting  from  better  human  health  and  from  lower 
emissions of CO2, however, means that a higher uptake 
of renewables could result in reduced external costs of 
USD 59 billion to USD 224 billion annually by 2030�
Further to the right of the government perspective curve 
are  the  main  power  sector  technologies�  Even  though 
many result in positive substitution costs, these do not 
include external benefits relating to reduced air pollution 
and climate change� The importance of including these 
is  evident  because  all  power  sector  technologies  are 
assumed  to  replace  coal  fired  generation�  The  very 
significant  growth  in  coal  power  generation  in  the 
Reference Case means that most of the new renewable 
capacity will have to replace it� And, though much of the 
coal will be imported, the price is still very low� The result 
is  positive  substitution  costs  for  most  of  the  power 
REmap Options except a few off-grid and rural systems 
that replace diesel� Yet, despite this, many technologies 
still  compete  very  well  on  costs�  Solar  PV  on  a  utility 
scale is only slightly positive, and onshore wind is also 
slightly more expensive than coal� Rooftop solar PV is 
used both for rural and off-grid applications, resulting 
The  benefits  of  modern  renewables,  therefore,  far 
outweigh  the  slight  increase  in  cost  to  the  energy 
system� Most of the benefit, ranging from USD 46 to USD 
161 billion per year, is related to reducedcosts associated 
with  a  lower  detriment  to  human  health,  including 
indoor  and  outdoor  air  pollution�  The  remaining  USD 
13-63  billion  relates  to  reducing  costs  associated  with 
climate change�
Total  investment  needs  in  renewable  technologies  in 
REmap  would  average  USD  42  billion  between  today 
and  2030�  This  is  made  up  of  USD  16  billion  annually 
taking  place  in  the  Reference  Case,  and  an  additional 
investment  of  USD  26  billion  due  to  the  REmap 
Options� Of this USD 26 billion, USD 21 billion would be 
necessary  new  investment  (incremental  investment)

REmap Options� No change in natural gas and nuclear 
demand is estimated, as they are not substituted in the 
REmap analysis� In comparison, total primary renewable 
energy  supply  increases  by  between  22%  and  85% 
in  REmap  relative  to  the  Reference  Case,  making  it 
second only to coal� As most of India’s oil is imported, 
and  increasing  amounts  of  coal  are  too,  the  REmap 
Option  would  result  in  reduced  dependence  on  fossil 
fuel imports�
the US – for an absolute reduction in emissions out of 
all 40 REmap countries� Together these three countries 
could  account  for  half  of  the  potential  reductions  in 
global  emissions�  Deploying  renewables  and  reducing 
emissions in these countries are therefore essential for 
both  bringing  about  a  transition  in  the  global  energy 
system and for mitigating climate change�
CO2 emissions savings resulting from 
the REmap Options would be 0.75 Gt 
annually by 2030, or a reduction of 
around 16% over the Reference Case 
level.
The  reduction  in  fossil  fuel  use  also  has  important 
environmental  benefits�  In  addition  to  avoided  costs 
from air pollution, valued at between USD 46-161 billion 
annually  by  2030,  there  are  also  savings  that  result 
from  reduced  CO2�  India’s  total  CO2  emissions  are 
estimated almost to treble from 1�6 gigatonnes (Gt) in 
2010 to 4�6 Gt by 2030 under the Reference Case� The 
REmap  Options  would  instead  result  in  an  estimated 
reduction of 0�75 (Gt) by 2030 (Figure 29)� The largest 
decrease  would  occur  in  the  power  generation  sector, 
followed by transport� If all REmap Options were fully 
deployed, India could reduce its CO2-related emissions 
from energy combustion by around 16% from the 2030 
Reference Case level (Table 11: Development of India CO2 
emissions, 2010-2030)� The monetary benefit of these 
savings  can  be  valued  at  between  USD  13-63  billion 
annually by 2030�16
Important  macroeconomic  benefits  would  also  result 
from greater deployment of renewable energy� IRENA 
has  conducted  an  in-depth  analysis  based  on  REmap 
findings17 looking into the effects of renewable energy 
on  employment,  GDP  and  welfare  (IRENA,  2015e), 
which demonstrates that renewable energy would have 
positive  macroeconomic  impacts  across  the  board  in 
India� It shows, for example, that – if the REmap Options 
were  deployed  –  GDP  would  be  around  1%  higher  in 
2030  than  under  the  Reference  Case�  Most  of  the 
positive  impacts  on  GDP  can  be  explained  by  the 
increased  investment  required  by  renewable  energy 
deployment,  which  triggers  ripple  effects  throughout 
the  economy�  There  are  also  important  impacts  on 
welfare, with India benefiting from some of the greatest 
improvements  observed 
in  any  REmap  country, 
primarily as a response to the reduced health impact of 
in  Indian  CO2  emissions  would 
Such  reductions 
contribute  just  under  10%  of  the  global  emission 
reductions,  which  could  be  achieved  if  all  Remap 
Options  for  doubling  the  share  of  renewable  energy 
in  global  energy  were  implemented  by  2030�  India 
has  the  third  largest  potential  –  following  China  and 
17  The  analysis  mentioned  in  this  section  was  conducted  using 
REmap findings for India from the first REmap global report� The 
findings  are  indicative  of  the  results  when  higher  deployment 
of  renewable  energy  occurs�  It  is  important  to  note  that,  as  the 
level  of  renewable  energy  deployment  in  India  in  REmap  has 
been  expanded  by  subsequent  analysis,  the  findings  presented 
in  the  report  are  likely  to  underestimate  the  level  of  positive 
macroeconomic effects�

Saving on the Externalities of Air Pollution and Climate Change” 
and its accompanying methodology document (IRENA, 2016e)�

air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions reductions� 
Developing economies are thus as likely as industrialised 
ones  to  benefit  from  economic  changes  from  more 
substantial  renewable  energy  deployment�  Finally, 
there are important increases in employment� India now 
has  around  500 000  people  working  in  the  modern 
renewable energy sector, and the study shows this could 
increase to 1�5 million in the Reference Case, and to as 
much  as  3�5  million  in  REmap  –  a  seven-fold  increase 
over  present  levels�  Employment  in  India  is  expected 
to increase substantially as it scales up its ambition for 
solar PV and wind deployment: meeting its 2022 target 
of 100 GW of solar alone is expected to create 1�1 million 
jobs (IRENA, 2015e)�

8.  BARRIERS TO A RENEWABLE ENERGY 
TRANSITION
This  chapter  goes  into  more  detail  about  some  of  the 
barriers to the renewable energy deployment detailed 
in  the  last  chapter,  since  accelerated  deployment  will 
present  unique  challenges  that  go  beyond  –  or  could 
exacerbate  –  typical  issues  arising  in  India’s  energy 
sector�
(excluding large hydropower that in 2015 amounted to 
an  additional  40  GW)�  The  Government,  under  its  12th 
Five Year Plan, aims to boost renewable energy capacity 
with  ambitious  capacity  targets  for  solar,  wind  and 
other sources� The country also has targets for end-use 
energy  technologies  and  the  REmap  Options  outline 
how  important  many  of  these  technologies  are  for 
meeting the country’s long-term energy goals�
One  challenge  in  the  years  to  2030  relates  to  issues 
associated with renewable power generation� Much of 
the technology deployed in REmap will be variable and 
often  split  into  more  decentralised  generation  units� 
Besides, increasing access to electrification will require 
more rural power production systems� The result will be 
an  increased  strain  on  India’s  already  stressed  power 
grid� Solutions will be needed to reinforce, expand and 
increase  the  flexibility  of  power  infrastructure�  REmap 
also directly addresses end-use sectors, and specifically 
the use of traditional forms of bioenergy for cooking and 
heating�  Enabling  a  clean,  affordable  shift  to  modern 
forms of renewable energy for heating and cooking will 
require  significant  improvement  of  India’s  bioenergy 
economy,  including  better  utilisation  of  residues  and 
waste,  and  cleaner  and  more  efficient  combustion  of 
bioenergy feedstocks�
Some  of  the  key  barriers  to  enabling  the  renewable 
energy  technology  deployment  identified  above  are 
listed  in  the  following  sections�  They  can  be  broadly 
categorised into several key areas:
 ●
Mobilising investment, high upfront costs and the 
uncertainty of revenue generation;
 ●
Difficulties in the business environment;
 ●
Required  solutions  for  decentralised  energy 
production and storage; and
 ●
Bioenergy challenges�
8�1  Mobilising investment
Renewable  energy  systems  tend  to  be  smaller  in  size, 
and incur high up-front investment� As REmap shows, 
the incremental investment is needed for capacity, but 
savings  result  from  reduced  fuel  costs�  Higher  capital 
cost  and  investment  schemes  that  can  value  lower 
long-term  operating  costs  resulting  from  smaller,  or 
no, fuel demand and fuel price uncertainty will need to 
be developed and made available� They will be needed 
to  expand  access  to  the  many  rural  communities  and 
smaller  businesses  that  have  local  renewable  energy 
potential,  but  insufficient  capital  to  develop  their  own 
capacity�
Investment in renewables needs to gain impetus if the 
targets are to be met and their great potential is to be 
tapped�  The  causal  factors  impacting  investments  are 
shown in Figure 30�
Investments  are  driven  by  the  expected  rate  of  return 
and the business environment� In the renewable energy 
sector, expected returns on investment are a function of 
the costs involved and the revenue generated�
Factors determining costs include:
 ●
The capital cost of the system� The costs of the 
technological  infrastructure  impact  investment, 
which 
like 
accelerated  depreciation,  viability  gap  funding 
and tax benefits are used to counter the effect of 
high system costs;
While  this  barrier  is  likely  to  impact  the  deployment 
of  renewables  up  to  2030,  there  are  already  several 
existing  challenges  to  deploying  renewables  in  India� 
Installed  renewable  energy  power  capacity  grew  from 
a mere 3�9 GW in 2003 to 42 GW by the end of 2015 
is  why  government 
incentives 
7 6
Figure 30: Framework to evaluate investments in renewable energy
Based on CEEW analysis
 ●
The cost of finance – itself affected by regulatory 
incentives,  interest  rates  and  loan  tenure  –  has 
a  big  impact  on  investment�  Investment  in 
renewable  energy  increases  when  finance  is 
available at affordable rates for long tenures;
charges  and/or  granted  first  access  to  the  grid, 
the  revenue  for  producers  increases,  further 
encouraging 
Investment  grows 
if  there  is  favourable  business  environment 
long  term  guarantees  on  policy 
providing 
measures,  giving  developers  assurance  of 
the  enforcement  of  obligations  and  incentive 
schemes  and  ensuring  a  fast  and  fair  legal 
framework to protect investments�
investment� 
 ●
The  cost  of  land  forms  a  large  proportion  of 
the total cost of a renewable energy project� As 
land costs are rising, investment continues to be 
adversely affected;
The  business  environment  in  the  renewable  energy 
sector is governed by such factors as:
 ●
The cost of evacuation infrastructure;
 ●
The  cost  of  storage,  which  is  affected  by  the 
share and scale of renewables; 
 ●
The  certainty  and  longevity  of  policies,  which 
build 
investor  confidence  and  encourage 
investment;
 ●
Operations and maintenance costs, which, when 
declining drive down total costs and encourage 
investment�
 ●
The timely enforcement of policies; the honouring 
of  contracts  and  the  strong  presence  of  the 
rule of law� Legally binding contracts guarantee 
investors  the  option  of  legal  recourse�  This  has 
a positive impact on investment as it makes the 
process more secure and
Revenues  from  renewables  can  be  driven  by  several 
factors, including:
 ●
The  extent  and  enforcement  of  renewable 
purchase obligations;
 ●
Operational ease for the developer, which in turn 
is affected by several factors, such as
 ●
The  tariff  at  which  renewable  power  is  sold, 
which can be affected by FiTs, tariff rebates, and 
generation-based incentives; and
 — the  approval  time  and  the  number  of 
clearances required;
 — access to information (pertaining to projects, 
 ●
Access to the grid, which is affected by wheeling 
charges  and  priority  dispatch  to  the  grid� 
When  renewables  are  exempt  from  wheeling 
generation and irradiance);
 — the availability of skilled manpower; and
 — the country’s standards of quality control�
7 7
Upfront costs
needed if India is to build significant renewable energy 
capacity,  and  the  country  has  reiterated  numerous 
times that it is looking for a global mechanism to help 
with some of the problems around hedging costs�
Initial  capital  requirements  are  significantly  higher 
for  renewable  energy  projects  than  for  conventional 
power  plants�  The  cost  of  wind  projects  ranges  from 
INR 4�5 to 6�85 crores per MW, and that of solar projects 
now  ranges  from  INR  6�5  crore  per  MW  for  utility 
scale  ones  to  10  crores  per  MW  for  rooftop  and  other 
decentralised  applications�  System  costs  account  for 
about 85% of the upfront costs with the cost of finance, 
land and evacuation infrastructure together accounting 
for the remaining 15%�
One  way  to  address  this  is  through  issuing  tax-free 
bonds�  Three  government  owned  agencies,  including 
the Power Finance Corporation and IREDA, are to raise 
more than USD 600 million in such bonds, and use the 
funding  to  provide  lower-cost  finance  to  renewable 
energy  project  developers�  Interest  rates  as  low  as 
10�5%  are  said  to  be  on  offer  (Cleantechnica,  2015b)� 
The New Development Bank has also announced plans 
to  issue  bonds  aimed  at  funding  renewable  energy 
development:  their  aim  could  be  to  provide  a  source 
of  finance  for  the  emerging  set  of  projects  resulting 
from  auction  programmes  for  renewable  power 
(Cleantechnica,  2016)�  Financing  can  be  particularly 
challenging for off-grid systems� Schemes to help have 
been  developed�  MNRE’s  flagship  programme  is  the 
‘Solar Off-grid Refinance Scheme’ (Figure 31), which is 
operationalised by IREDA through a network of banks 
and implementation partners identified by the Ministry 
through a separate process (NREL, 2012)�
Yet installed system costs are rapidly falling, particularly 
for solar PV� A recent bid in Rajasthan in January 2016 
set a record low for a supply contract in India, offering 
PV produced electricity for under INR 4�34/kWh�18 The 
lower  electricity  production  costs  are  partly  driven 
by  lower  equipment  costs,  but  also  by  lower  Energy 
Performance Certificate costs, and by improving terms 
for financing�
Funding renewable energy projects in India has become 
progressively easier over the past few years thanks to 
factors  ranging  from  progressive  fiscal  policies  to 
improved understanding of the intricacies of renewable 
energy financing� This has helped to overcome hurdles 
including  the  limited  availability  of  financing  options, 
a  limited  understanding  of  intricacies,  and  rigid  and 
unfavourable  debt  contracts�  Governmental  policies 
specifically  focusing  on  renewable  energy  and  on 
access  to  finance  for  it  have  opened  up  a  host  of 
options  for  developers,  ranging  from  government-
backed  banks  to  non-banking  financial  institutions� 
This  has  led  to  longer  term  tenures  with  additional 
refinancing  options  and  favourable  interest  rates�  So, 
a strong impetus from the government, coupled with 
an  enhanced  understanding  of  the  sector,  has  given 
developers  of  renewable  energy  projects  in  India  an 
improved  outlook  on  financing  (Bloomberg,  2015)� 
Currency  hedging  remains  a  problem,  however� 
Investments  made  with  local  currency  add  6-8 
percentage  points  to  costs  compared  to  those 
made  with  USD�  So  some  types  of  projects  can  have 
prohibitively  high  financing  costs  of  13-14%,  and  this 
is  viewed  unfavourably  by  the  many  international 
financiers and investment companies interested in the 
Indian market� International equity and investors will be 
Uncertainty of revenue generation
Uncertainty  in  generating  revenues  often  results  from 
inadequate  or  low  demand  for  solar  power,  the  gap 
between the LCOE and the prevailing tariff available on 
the  market,  and  challenges  associated  with  accessing 
the  grid�  Surplus  demand  on  the  power  exchange, 
and  the  way  the  low-cost  of  thermal-sourced  power 
is  inhibiting  states  from  procuring  more  renewable 
electricity, are also issues�
Lack of predictable demand for renewables
The  comparatively  high  LCOE  of  renewable  energy 
versus  conventional  fuels  has  previously  caused  low 
demand�  RPOs  are  intended  to  increase  generation 
in  states  with  high  solar  irradiation,  wind  potential  or 
biogasifier plants and to encourage trading with states 
that have less potential� However, poor compliance with 
RPO  mandates  has  implied  that  the  supply  of  RECs 
exceeds the demand on a monthly basis� As the stock 
of unsold RECs grows, the future outlook for renewable 
energy demand looks bleak unless robust enforcement 
of RPOs begins immediately� Auctions have addressed 
some of the issues over the lack of predictable demand

Challenges in accessing the grid
for renewable-sourced power, and will help to provide 
more revenue certainty for producers (see Box 11)�
Wheeling  and  banking  charges,  along  with  cross-
subsidy  surcharges,  are  levied  on  power  producers 
who feed power into the grid and add to developers’ 
project costs� Exempting renewable energy producers 
from these charges – as is already happening for solar 
energy in Karnataka – could increase expected returns 
on  investment,  However,  this  puts  a  burden  on  the 
utilities, so exemptions should only be given for short 
periods (it is 10 years in Karnataka)� In the absence of 
storage  technologies,  renewable  energy  projects  are 
vulnerable  to  variable  power  production  unless  they 
can  access  the  grid  and  supply  power  on  a  priority 
basis�
Gap between LCOE and prevailing tariffs
Until  grid  parity  is  reached  and  subsidies  on  fossil 
fuels  are  reduced,  there  will  be  a  gap  between  the 
tariff  that  distribution  companies  are  willing  to  offer 
to  purchase  power  and  the  LCOE  from  some  types 
of  renewable  energy  projects�  The  gap  can  be  filled 
via  a  variety  of  incentives  such  as  preferential  FiTs, 
generation-based  incentives,  or  tariff  rebates�  Each  is 
applicable or effective for different types of renewable 
energy applications�
7 9
Box 11: Auctions
Two types of mechanisms have been applied in India to reach its renewable energy targets� FiT were applied 
for projects on a first-come, first-serve basis: wind power has been the main beneficiary� The other mechanism 
has been auctions where tariffs were quoted that comply with technical and financial criteria� Solar power 
projects have been typically deployed through auctions�
The National Solar Mission has a committed systematic auction scheme� Between the scheme’s first and second 
round the total capacity offered more than doubled, and the price dropped by 28% (IRENA and CEM, 2015)� 
Under phase 1, batch I of the National Solar Mission, 150 MW of solar PV capacity was allocated in December 
2010  (PPAs  were  signed  for  just  140  MW)�  Under  Phase  1,  batch  II,  350  MW  capacity  was  allocated  in 
December  2011  (PPAs  signed  for  340  MW)�  Data  from  the  period  between  2010  and  2013,  suggests  that 
auction tariffs for solar PV are moving to market tariffs (Shrimali et al�, 2015)� Recent bids in 2015 and early 
2016  have  significantly  increased  capacity  deployment,  and  costs  are  falling  to  around  INR  4�2-5�0/kWh 
(USD 0�06-0�07/kWh), indicating that prices are at the lower range of the Mission’s target (Gambhir, 2016)�
There  have  been  auctions  in  such  developing  countries  as  China,  Morocco,  Peru,  and  South  Africa 
(IRENA, 2013b) and experience shows they are a cost-effective tool for deploying renewables by ensuring that 
projects are allocated fairly� However, deployment was often limited� A 2015 study the Climate Policy Initiative 
(Shrimali et al�, 2015) suggests ways of designing new auction systems by managing risks for cost-effective 
and high deployment of renewables, especially wind power�
The three features suggested are : “(i) To increase cost-effectiveness, ensure sufficient competition by setting 
the  volume  of  capacity  auctioned  well  within  the  market’s  ability  to  supply;  (ii)  To  improve  deployment 
effectiveness, impose strong penalties for delays in commissioning projects, implement support policies to 
improve transmission infrastructure, and provide government guarantees to reduce off-taker risk; and (iii) 
Use  auction  design  elements  that  can  mitigate  risks  to  achieve  both  cost-effectiveness  and  deployment 
effectiveness  together�  For  the  specific  case  of  wind  energy  in  India,  introduce  auctions  in  a  controlled 
environment,  in  which  the  project  site  is  already  identified,  transmission  infrastructure  is  planned,  and 
resource assessment studies are completed prior to bidding�” (Shrimali et al�, 2015)�
8�2   Enabling business environment
investors�  Investment  would  benefit  significantly  from 
establishing  single  clearance  windows  and  expedition 
channels�  Skilled  manpower  is  also  essential  as  it 
impinges directly on the implementation and scale-up 
of  projects:  investors  are  cautious  about  the  returns 
on  their  investment  in  its  absence�  This  issue  can  be 
overcome by building local capacity development into 
renewable energy projects�
India’s  renewable  energy  sector  has  suffered  from 
delays  in  policy  announcements  (as  in  launching 
Phase  2  of  the  National  Solar  Missions),  frequent 
changes  in  policy  guidelines  (including  the  type  and 
quantum  of  incentives  provided),  and  changes  in  the 
agencies overseeing the implementation of policy� The 
absence of a strong policy framework reduced investor 
confidence and led to a sharp decline in investment� It 
fell in the wind sector, for example, from USD 3�9 billion 
in 2011/2012 to USD 1�8 billion in 2012/2013, following the 
rollback  of  key  governmental  fiscal  benefits  including 
accelerated  depreciation  adjustments� 
Investors 
often  cite  such  issues,  such  as  limited  availability  of 
information about commissioned projects, and project-
related  data  including  regional  resource  assessments, 
as sources of rising perceived risk� The large number of 
clearances required, and time taken for them, also deter 
8�3  Challenges to decentralised 
energy
The  Government  of  India  runs  several  initiatives  to 
increase  distributed  renewable  energy  in  rural  areas, 
including  the  Ministry  of  Power’s  Decentralized 
Distributed Generation Scheme, started in 2009, which 
covers  deployment  of  renewable-energy-based  mini 
grids�  Similarly,  the  National  Solar  Mission,  as  stated 
8 0
8�4  Skills development
in Box 6, includes an off-grid systems component and 
target�
India will need to develop a skilled and knowledgeable 
workforce,  if  it  is  to  realise  a  significant  growth  in 
renewable power capacity, enable a secure and strong 
future  grid,  and  provide  modern  energy  access  to 
its  population�  The  lack  of  employees  trained  in  the 
skills  needed  to  construct  and  operate  decentralised 
renewable  energy  systems  is  an  existing  and  ongoing 
challenge  which  is  recognised  as  a  barrier  to  realising 
renewable energy targets�
Yet,  despite  these  programmes,  the  decentralised 
energy  market  suffers  from  various  challenges�  One 
is  posed  by  public  perception,  which  believes  grid 
electricity to be the only acceptable form of power, and 
this is compounded by the absence of strong regulatory 
frameworks  to  mainstream  distributed  renewable 
energy� The big challenge for distributed renewables is 
to develop business and financing models that trigger 
rapid  deployment  and  ownership,  particularly  at  the 
residential scale�
The country has made an effort to create qualification 
standards for its workforce� The Skill Council for Green 
Jobs  and  MNRE  have  been  working  to  integrate 
renewable  energy  curricula  into  training  and  skill 
development institutions� Renewable energy coursework 
also has been promoted into India’s Industrial Training 
Institutes (NRDC, 2016)�
The decentralised renewable energy market also suffers 
from a wide range of differing subsidies and standards, 
which  are  often  not  monitored  or  implemented 
effectively�  This,  together  with  lack  of  finance  for 
small  distributed  energy  systems  that  do  not  enjoy 
investor confidence, further hinders the rapid uptake of 
distributed renewable energy projects�
The government has plans to develop a “Solar Army”, 
providing new jobs for installers and operators of solar 
PV plants� A specially-created association for renewable 
energy  will  help  standardise  and  certify  renewable 
energy  technologies,  with  dedicated  shops  for  solar 
products� Demonstration projects are planned, and India 
will  strengthen  its  international  co-operation  activities 
for them and for research and development�
Integrating  large  shares  of  variable  power  generation 
requires important consideration of the planning for, and 
development of, a future grid� Detailed system analysis 
and market design are key to enabling integration, and 
investment  certainty  needs  to  be  provided  to  utilities 
and system owners so as to enable growth in generation 
assets  and  infrastructure�  Integrating  renewables  into 
the  power  sector  also  has  endogenous  implications 
for  using  the  capacity  of  complementary  generation 
assets�  Increased  renewable  penetration  could  lead  to 
low capacity utilisation for complementary assets that 
could be required to enable flexibility�
8�5  Electricity storage
The Government’s increased solar PV target of 100 GW 
in 2022 will increase the share of renewables from 3% to 
10�5%� MNRE is working with states to understand how 
such an ambitious target would impact their generation 
profiles, and what could be the possible challenges for 
evacuating power across the transmission network� India 
has  also  been  considering  an  increase  from  installing 
3 GW of wind energy a year to 10 GW�
The  recently-announced  Green  Energy  Corridor  could 
help address some of these challenges� The project will 
fund  improvements  in  electric  transmission  systems 
to  facilitate  the  transport  of  power  from  areas  rich 
in  renewable  energy  to  parts  of  the  country  where 
demand  for  power  is  high  (ADB,  2015)�  Another 
interesting approach is the development of solar-wind 
hybrid  parks  that  can  use  transmission  infrastructure 
better by reducing the variability and production peaks 
of large renewable power projects and thus demand on 
the grid� India is also pursuing further development of 
mini and micro-grids: it issued a draft grid policy in early 
2016 to allow for developing power capacity in smaller 
grid systems (Bridge to India, 2016)�
India has many different geographical conditions ranging 
from deserts to long coastlines to the highest mountain 
areas,  which  means  that  energy  storage  technologies 
can  be  tested  and  explored  in  different  scenarios�  Its 
grid  infrastructure  has  difficulties  in  keeping  up  with 
demand  growth:  load-shedding  is  coming,  and  peak 
prices  have  been  introduced  to  reduce  consumption� 
Furthermore,  India  has  a  large  programme  to  provide 
electricity to the 43% of rural households without access 
8 1
to distributed renewable power generation, in the form 
of solar home systems or mini-grids� These can provide 
a  quick  solution  for  electricity  access,  but  back-up 
systems  in  the  form  of  diesel  generators,  bio-based 
power  generation,  or  small  hydropower  or  electricity 
storage  would  be  required  to  ensure  that  power  is 
available around the clock�
quickly  to  fluctuations  in  power  demand  and  supply� 
Fourthly,  India’s  distribution  networks  have  reported 
average losses of around 26%, with the worst averaging 
54%�
Renewable  power  generation  from  wind  and  solar 
PV  are  rapidly  increasing,  addressing  the  need  for  a 
more  diversified  power  mix  and  additional  generation 
capacity across the country� Yet, at the same time, they 
require  additional  measures  to  handle  their  variable 
generation patterns�
The  Green  Energy  Corridor  project  focuses  on 
strengthening interconnection across states, and there 
will be nodal agencies within each state supported by 
a national platform and the Ministry� MNRE recognises 
that deployment opportunities may differ substantially 
among  states  depending  on  their  population  density, 
the  need  for  power  sources  in  the  agricultural  sector, 
and  requirements  for  rural  electrification�  It  will  also 
focus  on  the  opportunities  for  deploying  solar  PV  on 
city  rooftops  and  close  to  existing  power  stations, 
as  part  of  its  ambitious  plans�  In  total,  50-60  GW 
could  be  deployed  in  a  distributed  manner�  MNRE  is 
also  considering  a  policy  to  oblige  power  producers 
expanding  their  fossil  fuel  fleet  to  pair  it  with  at  least 
10% renewable power generation�
India is the world’s fifth largest installer of wind power, 
and had a total installed capacity of 22 GW by the end 
of 2014 (IRENA, 2015d)� The majority of which is in five 
states:  Tamil  Nadu  (>7  GW),  Gujarat  and  Maharashtra 
(>3 GW), Rajasthan (>2�5 GW), and Karnataka (>2 GW)� 
These states are expected to add an additional 20 GW 
by  the  end  of  2017�  The  problem  for  integrating  wind 
power  generation  into  the  grid  is  that  the  peak  wind 
season in some of these states (e�g� Gujarat and Tamil 
Nadu)  runs  from  May  to  August,  whilst  peak  power 
requirements  are  in  October,  when  wind  resources 
are low (CEA, 2013)� So wind contributes up to 35% of 
overall  electricity  consumption  per  month  in  the  wind 
peak season, but as little as 5% per month in the peak 
demand  season�  Grid  balancing  has  been  achieved 
through  reducing  generation  in  coal-based  power 
plants in Tamil Nadu and gas-fired plants in Rajasthan� 
However, the coal-fired power plants are relatively old 
and  their  flexibility  is  constrained�  Furthermore,  using 
hydropower  for  regulation  is  limited  to  non-irrigation-
based installations which, in the case of in Tamil Nadu, 
amounts to only 1�3 GW�
These recent developments show that India exemplifies 
many  of  the  opportunities  and  challenges  for  storing 
electricity or integrating renewables� It has tremendous 
renewable  energy  resources  and  plans  significant 
expansion of renewable capacity, especially for solar PV� 
However,  challenges  to  a  high-level  of  deployment  of 
solar PV include the strength of local distribution grids, 
which  may  limit  revenue  streams  for  solar  systems  if 
incentives for feeding in excess electricity are available�
Electricity storage for integrating utility-scale 
renewables
Solar PV production mainly takes place in utility-scale 
plants  with  a  total  installed  capacity  of  around  2  GW 
(mainly concentrated in Gujarat, which reached around 
1 GW in 2014)� The government has opened a number 
of  solar  500MW  to  2500  MW  parks,  which  will  allow 
20  GW  of  solar  PV  to  be  added  to  the  grid  between 
2014 and 2019 through being connected to the state or 
central transmission networks�
India’s  transmission  and  distribution  network  faces  a 
number of challenges simultaneously (India Electronics 
and  Semiconductor  Association  (IESA),  2014)�  Firstly, 
it needs rapid expansion to keep up with the growing 
demand, but there are administrative hurdles and delays 
in  the  way�  There  has  been  a  peak  power  deficit  of 
around 9% (12 GW) (FICCI, 2013), and many cities have 
load-shedding  and  higher  electricity  prices  to  reduce 
peak demand� Secondly, electricity supply and demand 
are not evenly distributed across the country, requiring 
new inter-regional transmission capacity� Thirdly, around 
60% of the existing power generation capacity consists 
of coal thermal plants, with limited capability to respond 
Distributed  renewable  power  generation  can  provide 
valuable system support to the grid: in Mahrashtra it is 
providing voltage support at weak points� Renewables 
can also support local reliability by allowing “islanding” 
of distribution networks when a surrounding grid is in 
fault/blackout (NITI Aayog, 2015)�
8 2
Electricity  storage,  coupled  to  renewable  power 
generation,  can  address  any  integration  challenges 
that  are  associated  with  utility-scale  wind  and  solar 
PV  plants,  and  some  of  India’s  regulatory  regimes 
provide favourable circumstances� There is a surcharge 
of INR 2�75/kWh for electricity production during peak 
times  on  the  short  term  energy  exchange  and  many 
businesses  and  villages  have  diesel  generation  (at  a 
cost of over INR 18/kWh) to guard against black-outs� 
Furthermore,  the  Indian  regulator  uses  Unscheduled 
Interchange  (UI)  and  power  factor  incentives  that 
could be used to support the deployment of electricity 
storage  (IESA,  2014)�  The  Power  Grid  Corporation  of 
India (PGCIL) expects that 20 GW of flexible generation, 
including storage and supercritical thermal generators, 
will be required in 2016/2017 (Power Grid Corporation, 
2012)� It has three 50–250 kWh demonstration projects 
in place in the context of its Frequency Response Pilot 
Project, demonstrations include an advanced lead-acid, 
a lithium-ion, and a flow battery�
In  2012,  over  43%  of  rural  households  did  not  have 
access  to  electricity,  but  the  country  has  extensive 
plans to rapidly increase electrification and is extending 
distribution  networks  to  connect  rural  villages�20 
Under  the  DDUGJV  scheme,  the  Ministry  of  Power 
has  sanctioned  the  electrification  of  124 786  villages, 
and  the  expansion  of  the  electrification  in  602 910 
more�  Connections  to  108 913  un-electrified  villages 
and intensive electrification of another 314 160 villages 
has already been completed (MoP, 2014a)� At the same 
time, India is also supporting decentralised distributed 
generation to villages which cannot be cost-effectively 
connected  to  the  grid  or  where  there  are  only  limited 
hours  of  supply�  Decentralised  distributed  generation 
projects  receive  90%  subsidies  towards  capital 
expenditure,  and  connections  to  Below  Poverty  Line 
(BPL)  households  are  financed  with  100%  capital 
subsidies at INR 3 000 each� (MoP, 2013)�
The household load for an individual village is assumed 
to be 200 W, and most electricity demand is for lighting 
or businesses after sunset� Both individual solar home 
systems  and  micro  grids  could  be  used  to  provide 
electricity, but storage systems or back-up power would 
be required to provide electricity at night�
The cheapest option for storage is pumped hydropower� 
India has nine such schemes in place with an aggregated 
installed  capacity  of  almost  5  GW,  but  only  five  – 
with an aggregated installed capacity of 2�6 GW – are 
actually working in pumping mode� The other four have 
problems with vibrations or tail pool dams that have not 
yet been constructed� Two more pumped hydropower 
storage  plants,  with  an  aggregated  capacity  of  1GW, 
were under construction in 2013, and another 2�5GW of 
pumped hydropower plans were being investigated� The 
CEA estimates the potential of pumped hydropower at 
almost 100 GW, 40% in the Western region (CEA, 2013)�
Most  decentralised  distributed  generation  is  based  on 
diesel  generators,  which  can  provide  electricity  at  a 
nominal  cost  of  INR  30/kWh�  According  to  USAID, 
solar  PV  coupled  with  advanced  electricity  storage 
systems  produce  electricity  cheaper  than  these  diesel 
generators�  IESA  estimates  that  there  is  a  market  for 
energy storage of around 1�4 GW for rural micro grids 
and 1 GW of grid connected rural electrification�
USAID examined the ability of energy storage systems 
to reduce constraints in transmission capacity in Tamil 
Nadu,  where  it  is  underutilised  for  9  months  per  year 
(USAID,  2014)�  Assuming  capital  costs  of  around  INR 
4 692/MW/day  for  the  transmission  network,19  they 
calculated  that  current  battery  storage  systems  were 
not  cost-effective  and  that  their  capital  costs  would 
need to come down by 80%�
Electricity storage for other applications
There  are  a  number  of  other  markets  for  electricity 
storage  in  India�  Many  industrial  and  commercial 
users  (including  clusters  of  small  and  medium-size 
enterprises) are already deploying lead acid batteries or 
diesel generators to provide back-up power� Advanced 
electricity  storage  systems  could  be  used  to  replace 
traditional  back-up  power  sources,  and  to  reduce  the 
costs  of  peak  pricing  to  industrial  and  commercial 
users (USAID, 2014)� IESA estimates a market of around 
Electricity  storage  for  decentralised  and  off-grid 
deployment of renewables
20 A  village  is  deemed  electrified  if  10%of  all  the  households  of 
the  village  has  electricity  access  and  if  electricity  is  provided  to 
public spaces such as schools, panchayat officers, health centres, 
community centres and dispensaries�
19  This estimate is at least a factor of three lower than the costs of the 
transmission network in the US (USD 65-390/kW/day for the US, 
compared to USD 27/kW/day in the case of India)�
8 3
1�3 GW for this application� Another option is to couple 
advanced  electricity  storage  systems  to  utility-scale 
renewable power generation plants on site, allowing for 
smoothing the power generation mix (IESA estimates a 
market of around 1 GW in 2022)� Finally, there is a large 
market for electricity storage systems coupled to solar 
PV panels or small wind turbines for powering telecom 
towers:  only  2%  of  India’s  some  740 000  such  towers, 
are  provided  with  renewable  power�  (IESA  expects  a 
potential market of around 700 MW in 2022)�
process heating� No change in total demand for primary 
biomass  (about  7  EJ)  is  expected  between  2010  and 
2030,  but  –  according  to  REmap  –  the  2030  market 
structure  is  extended  toward  uses  beyond  cooking� 
Biomass  use  in  2030  is  expected  to  have  notably 
increased  in  process  heat  generation  (from  1�2  EJ  to 
2�4 EJ), in power generation (from 0�1 EJ to 0�8 EJ) and 
in the transport sector (from negligible to 0�9 EJ)�
Supplying the considerable increase in biomass demand 
for  such  different  applications  will  require  planning 
in  the  entire  supply  chain�  Power  and  manufacturing 
industry sectors will require the security of continuous 
supply� Planning for the uptake of this biomass potential 
can  accelerate  deployment�  Meeting  the  demand  for 
power  and  heat  generation  will  mean  that  plants  will 
need to be located in areas with access to local biomass 
feedstocks,  as  will  ethanol  and  diesel  production 
plants�  Feedstocks  can,  of  course,  be  transported,  but 
estimates  show  that  –  under  unfavourable  conditions 
– storage and transportation costs can represent two-
thirds  of  total  biomass  costs  in  India�  Hence  it  will  be 
essential to assess biomass supply by region and to link 
this  potential  to  meeting  demand�  Available  biomass 
feedstocks  at  present  have  several  competing  uses 
beyond energy applications where practices vary from 
state to state� Such uses of biomass will also need to be 
considered in planning for the increased demand, and 
the use of feedstocks that do not compete with these 
applications should be prioritised (Ravindranath, 2005; 
Natarajan et al�, 2015)�
8�6  Bioenergy challenges
Biomass would account for a significant share of India’s 
total final renewable energy use in 2030 if the potential 
of all the technology options identified in REmap were 
deployed�  The  estimated  demand  for  primary  energy 
in  REmap  is  7  EJ,  less  than  IRENA’s  supply  potential 
estimate  of  8�6-9�1  EJ  in  2030�  The  country  has  the 
potential  to  supply  its  demand  domestically  with  its 
own resources�
There are challenges in realising this potential� One is the 
market environment for rural sustainable bioenergy use 
compared to fossil fuels, which still receive subsidies in 
parts of the energy system, particularly for rural energy 
needs  (see  Box  12)�  It  will  be  important  to  develop 
government  programmes  to  increase  awareness  and 
local and regional modern cook stove initiatives that can 
ensure affordable and reliable equipment�
If feedstock is available, biogas can be a cost-effective 
option�  The  Government  has  funded  many  household 
biogas  installations  –  running,  for  example,  on  cattle 
waste  –  over  past  decades,  but  many  have  fallen  into 
disuse�  Government  funding  resulted  in  beneficiaries 
not  always  being  motivated  to  maintain  systems 
financially, or lacking the knowledge to do so� Training 
in  maintenance  and  requiring  a  financial  stake  in 
systems  will  help  ensure  they  are  kept  running  for 
years�  Household  programmes  can  be  expanded  to 
the commercial scale, and there is significant potential 
for biogas development if commercial scale plants can 
be set up in large hotels, sewage treatment plants, and 
industry�
While  managing  biomass  feedstocks  is  a  serious 
challenge for bio-energy projects, there are also others� 
Concerns  were  raised  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  about 
the  growing  practice  of  head-loading  firewood  to 
cater  for  needs  in  small  towns  and  large  cities  with 
flourishing firewood markets� As such markets become 
an  important  source  of  income  and  livelihoods,  the 
questions  arise  of  whether  there  will  be  a  tendency 
to  exploit  biomass  resources  unsustainably  and  even 
illegally�  There  have  been  reports  of  women  in  some 
rural areas having to walk even greater distances than 
usual to collect firewood, or having to switch to inferior 
fuels such as shrubs, roots, weeds, or loose crop residues 
(AIREC/SSEF, 2014)�
Today’s bioenergy market focuses mainly on household 
cooking,  with  smaller  amounts  used  for  industrial 
8 4
Box 12: Fossil fuel subsidies
Another important and major challenge hindering the growth of renewable energy – and financial investment 
– is the way and level at which traditional energy is priced� Administered pricing and associated subsidies 
create  a  situation  where  subsidised  fossil  fuels  –  or  energy  derived  from  them  –  tends  to  be  significantly 
cheaper  than  the  market  price,  leading  to  a  skewed  marketplace  in  which  renewables  have  to  compete� 
Government  spending  on  subsidies  for  petroleum  products  —  which  was  as  high  as  INR  1 39 869  crore 
(USD 2�3 billion), or about 1�2% of GDP in 2013/14 — limits the government’s spending elsewhere, including 
increasing  the  capital  investment  in  renewables�  Investment  in  renewables  can  yield  significantly  greater 
returns than such purely consumptive spending as with subsidies� This issue is high on the agenda both in 
India and in international forums like the G20, which has made fossil fuel subsidies a topic for discussion and 
action� In India, the issue is exemplified by:
Subsidised kerosene – competing with decentralised renewables
The subsidy associated with kerosene, widely used as a primary lighting source in rural India, is exorbitant� 
Subsidised kerosene is priced at INR 14/litre, and is not available anywhere in the country at market price� 
India imports almost 80% of its petroleum (crude and products) consumption, and kerosene is subsidised 
by more than 70% in terms of import price parity� So the final consumer pays less than a third of the actual 
cost of the fuel� This has two implications for decentralised renewables� First, subsidised kerosene competes 
with the decentralised lighting solutions based on such renewables as solar� Second, since it is so cheap, it is 
heavily black marketed and adulterated into ‘subsidised’ diesel to use as auto-fuel and to run irrigation pumps 
in areas with poor electricity availability – leading investment in renewable energy based options like solar 
pumps being unviable�
Subsidised electricity, in a generation mix with an 80% contribution from thermal sources
Another  way  in  which  some  Indian  states  heavily  subsidise  fossil-fuel-based  energy  is  by  subsidising 
electricity to the end consumers, especially domestic and agricultural ones� Thermal, essentially coal-based, 
plants  contribute  as  much  as  80%  of  the  country’s  generated  electricity�  Hence  any  subsidy  to  electricity 
invariably subsidises coal consumption to a significantly higher extent than renewables�

9  SUGGESTIONS FOR ACCELERATED 
RENEWABLE ENERGY UPTAKE
 ●
Developing  and  using  renewable  energy  is  a  priority� 
It  helps  to  address  the  growing  challenge  of  energy 
demand  and  to  enhance  the  security  and  diversity  of 
energy supplies� Based on the existing policy framework 
discussion  and  on  barriers  to  renewable  energy  in 
India  in  the  previous  sections,  this  chapter  provides 
suggestions with following five themes:
Maintaining  the  longevity  and  credibility  of 
policy  support:  prematurely  cutting  off  support 
for  projects 
investor 
confidence  and  apprehension 
for  project 
developers,  often  prohibiting  new  ones  from 
entering  the  market�  India’s  renewable  energy 
projects respond to postitive incentives, such as 
accelerated  depreciation  and  generation-based 
incentives,  which  need  to  be  stable  and  not 
revised mid-term;
leads  to  plummeting 
1� 
Establishing  transition  pathways  for  renewable 
energy
2� 
Creating an enabling business environment
 ●
Increasing  outreach  to  banks  and  establishing 
a  Green  Bank:  domestic  banks  should  be 
encouraged  to  see  renewables  (especially  wind 
and  solar)  as  credible  business  opportunities� 
Policies driving the creation of a Green Bank are 
critical  for  injecting  new  liquidity  and  reducing 
the cost of capital for renewable energy projects� 
Green  banks  offer  low  cost  capital  at  lower 
interest  rates  than  is  available  in  private  sector 
transactions�  Multilateral  financing  and  self-
financing  provide  the  majority  of  the  funding 
of  ongoing  renewable  energy  projects�  With 
international  funding  expected  to  decline,  it 
is  critical  to  have  policies  to  abate  the  risks 
perceived  by  domestic  banks  and  to  increase 
lending;

Managing knowledge; and,

Unleashing innovation�
9�1  Establishing transition 
pathways
Like most countries, India has national plans and targets, 
indicating  its  long  term  commitment  to  renewable 
energy� Onshore wind, solar PV, small hydropower and 
biogas  cogeneration  are  the  most  active  renewable 
energy  technologies,  with  wind  contributing  the  lion’s 
share of the total capacity and other technologies still 
in their infancy� Initiatives planned for the coming years 
include  a  greater  focus  on  solar  PV,  offshore  wind, 
CSP  and  cogeneration  from  bagasse  for  distributed 
renewable  power�  Assessments  of  these  technologies’ 
potential  indicate  that  policy  and  R&D  support  will 
ensure  the  deployment  of  all  types  of  renewables, 
avoid any technology lock-in, and accelerate the overall 
renewables contribution to the energy mix�
 ●
Using infrastructure debt funds for investment in 
renewable energy: long-term debt lines and lower 
interest  rates  offered  by  such  debt  funds  can 
enable the renewable energy market to expand� 
Infrastructure  debt  funds  can  act  as  a  conduit 
for  debt  financing  into  infrastructure  projects 
with  more  favourable  terms�  An  appropriate 
project  authority,  such  as  IREDA,  could  provide 
guarantees to make this tool effective; and
This  section  includes  recommendations  that  propose 
coherent  and  economically  feasible  policies�  The 
relatively high cost and low availability of debt in India 
significantly  increases  the  cost  of  renewable  energy 
projects�  Thus  the  financing  woes  of  the  renewable 
energy sector could be mitigated by:
 ●
lending 
Establishing  priority  sector 
for 
renewables,  by  which  they  are  unbundled  from 
other  power  projects,  thus  boosting  low-cost 
financing  for  them�  Installations  of  distributed 
renewable energy systems already benefit from 
having  access  to  priority  sector  lending  status, 
8 6
9�2  Enabling business environment
and  this  could  be  extended  to  grid  connected 
renewable energy� Unbundling renewables from 
the  existing  power  sector,  with  independent 
lending  limits  for  the  renewable  energy  sector, 
would  increase  the  availability  of  domestic 
financing�
Policy frameworks that provide a level playing field for 
renewable energy and facilitate the formation of markets 
must be developed� The lack of ease in doing business 
poses  a  great  challenge  for  up  scaling  renewables  in 
India�  Policy  instability,  delays  in  clearances,  clearance 
malpractices  and  the  absence  of  clear  information 
all  deter  the  move  towards  increasing  the  share  of 
renewables  in  the  country’s  energy  mix�  Policy  efforts 
to counter these problems include:
Other policies can also catalyse the transition to a higher 
renewable energy future:
 ●
Improving  the  enforcement  of  RPOs  to  signal 
renewable  energy  demand  clearly�  Uncertainty 
over  RPO  enforcement  and  over  the  future  of 
RECs  reduces  lender  confidence�  The  states  of 
Rajasthan  and  Tamil  Nadu  have  already  made 
moves towards improving RPO enforcement;
 ●
Timely implementation of policies and incentives, 
these  will  be  essential  in  encouraging  investor 
confidence�  Existing  policies,  shackled  by  tardy 
bureaucratic  procedures,  significantly  hamper 
investor and project developer interests� Policies 
to counter red tape are critical;
 ●
Creating conducive land acquisition policies: land 
acquisition  policies  like  those  in  the  states  of 
Gujarat  and  Rajasthan  are  essential  to  give  a 
boost to renewable energy projects� As discussed 
in  this  report,  the  cost  of  land  imposes  a 
significant cost on solar and wind projects� State 
government  policies,  which  designate  land  for 
the  development  of  such  projects,  while  taking 
local  conditions  and  sensitivities  into  account, 
could  counter  the  problem  of  land  acquisition 
and the high cost of land;
 ●
Transparent  bidding  processes  with  rigorous 
selection criteria are crucial for overall stakeholder 
participation, and especially for attracting serious 
players�  This  would  ensure  that  projects  are 
allocated to actors who have the ability to ensure 
project completion and attract financing� These 
projects must be monitored to make certain that 
they  operate  at  the  contracted  capacity,  feed 
power into the grid, follow mandates for quality 
standards etc�;
 ●
Introducing  net  metering  policies  to  tap  into 
the  large  potential  for  decentralised  (rooftop) 
renewable  energy  production  in  India�  Net 
metering  systems  would  allow  households 
to  feed  excess  power  back  into  the  grid,  thus 
increasing the use of renewables;
 ●
A  single  window  clearance  facility  with  time-
bound  clearances  for  new  projects  should 
be  established,  as  has  been  done  by  state 
regulatory  agencies  in,  for  example,  ,  Rajasthan 
and  Chhattisgarh�  Single  clearance  and  time-
bound  clearances  enable  project  developers  to 
anticipate accurately the time and effort required 
to  get  project  clearance,  and  improve  investor 
confidence  by  providing  a  greater  degree  of 
certainty and ease of operation in the renewable 
energy market;
 ●
Encouraging farmers to grow biofuel crops under 
rain-fed rather than irrigated conditions� Such a 
policy  would  boost  agricultural  returns  in  rain-
fed  areas,  and  provided  competition  with  food 
crops can be avoided, would minimise the risk of 
inducing food insecurity;
 ●
A nationwide training programme for renewable 
energy  technologies  should  be  designed  and 
instituted under the National Skills Development 
Council� The transition to an energy future with a 
significantly larger share of renewable energy is 
partly  contingent  on  the  availability  of  a  skilled 
and  trained  workforce�  The  Government  has 
announced that around 11 000 solar technicians 
 ●
Shifting  to  alternative  (and  more  energy-
efficient) chemicals to reduce HFC emissions in 
the residential air-conditioning sector; and
 ●

8 7
were  trained  in  2015  –  to  be  joined  by  another 
50 000  between  2016  and  2019  –  to  build  a 
‘Solar Army’ to meet the ambitious solar energy 
targets�  The  workers  will  receive  training  under 
the  government’s  national  skill  development 
mission  at  such  organisations  as  the  industrial 
training institutes (ITIs)�
 ●
information  and 
Encouraging  the  use  of 
communication  technology  (ICT)  to  manage 
peak load, especially in metro cities� This can be 
used  for  demand  management,  thus  enabling 
consumers  to  modify  their  use  of  power  based 
on the load on the grid� Similarly, the utilities can 
use it to manage loads, congestion and shortfalls� 
ICT  initiatives  would  also  reduce  the  cost  of 
stand-alone energy storage;
 ●
Costs  and  benefits  must  be  considered  when 
developing  new  policies�  Cleaning  up  power 
plants,  for  example,  results  in  health  benefits 
worth twenty-five times the cost�
 ●
In systems where losses are high because of the 
geographical spread of the grid system, a larger 
number of lower-capacity substations, together 
with  the  conversion  of  single-phase  supply  to 
three-phase  supply,  would  reduce  these  losses 
substantially�  Designing  systems  with  “slack 
capacity”  is  also  important  by  considering  the 
trade-off  between  upfront 
investment  and 
distribution costs; and
9�3  Smooth integration of 
renewable energy
Significant  delays  in  deploying  renewable  energy  are 
caused  by  the  high  costs  of  evacuation  infrastructure, 
wheeling  charges  etc�  Project  developers  need  to  be 
given incentives, like first access to the grid in the form 
of  priority  dispatch  schemes  etc�,  if  renewable  energy 
is  to  be  scaled  up�  The  sector  still  requires  significant 
support and facilitation to ensure timely and adequate 
evacuation infrastructure� Policies to this effect include:
 ●
Improving the grid as a top priority in mitigating 
constraints in power supply�
9�4  Managing and creating 
knowledge
 ●
Exempting  renewable  energy  projects  from 
wheeling, banking and cross-subsidy charges, as 
already  happens  in  states  like  Maharashtra  and 
Karnataka� A policy to this effect would provide 
exemption for a fixed period, usually 10-15 years 
from  commissioning  of  the  plant�  This  reduces 
the cost of the PPA for industrial and commercial 
consumers alike;
Data  on  renewable  energy  is  often  incomplete  and 
difficult to collect, posing a significant challenge both for 
investors and for policy makers� The need for up-to-date, 
comprehensive data is well understood, and initiatives 
to collect it continue� Yet additional efforts are required 
to  provide  it  inexpensively  to  project  developers  and 
financiers  in  order  to  reduce  their  perception  of  risk� 
This  includes  data  on  existing  and  potential  projects, 
various actors in the market and government policies� 
Thus,  renewable  energy  deployment  will  benefit  from 
policies to:
 ●
Establishing  a 
for  setting  up 
roadmap 
sub-stations  and  transformers�  Policies  to 
systematically  upgrade  grid  infrastructure  for 
power  evacuation  are  specifically  needed  to 
improve  energy  access  and  electrify  villages 
without  power�  Several  states,  including  Bihar, 
are already developing plans for additional sub-
stations and transformers;
 ●
Improve data collection from developers on the 
status of projects, capacity added per year and 
jobs  created�  This  would  enable  policy  makers 
to  formulate  better  support  frameworks  and 
investors to have a better understanding of the 
market, which, in turn could drive up investment;
 ●
Ensuring  priority  dispatch 
for  renewable 
energy�  This  would  mean  that  power  from  all 
grid-connected  renewable  energy  projects,  is 
guaranteed  grid  access,  irrespective  of  project 
size or the load at the time;
 ●
Establish  information  platforms  for  lending 
institutions  to  encourage  partnerships  between 
banks to syndicate loans, share experiences, etc�

Box 13: A proposal for a National Biomass Mission
Biomass from agricultural residues and from forests and wastelands presents a huge potential for energy 
generation in India� Preliminary estimates for the potential of power from biomass – based on agricultural 
production levels for 2012/2013 and the biomass surplus available from forests and wastelands – suggests that 
the total untapped potential was close to 41 GW, in addition to the energy generated and used in cogeneration 
plants� This estimate takes into account all the competing uses of biomass – including as a traditional fuel for 
cooking and heating, and fodder for livestock – and has mapped the resource potential from surplus biomass 
alone� As agricultural output increases in the years ahead, the biomass available for power production is also 
set to rise� Thus, an aggressive target of 25 GW of biomass power (electricity and co-generation) by 2020 
would be achievable even though power and cogeneration from biomass now stands at a mere 2�7 GW�
Proposed National Biomass mission
 ● Term: 2015-2020
 ● Capacity target: 25 GW
 ● Investment required: USD 8�75 billion
 ● Average size: 5-6 MW plants (5000 plants of 5MW each)
 ● Land requirement: 1 acre/MW
 ● Land footprint: 2�14% of India’s total wastelands
 ● Employment generated: approximately 62 500 full time jobs in operations and maintenance and several 
additional jobs in construction, fuel collection, processing and transportation
Moreover, cogeneration – most applicable in industries – has a large potential in India’s sugar industry, which 
has traditionally practised it using bagasse as fuel� With advanced biomass cogeneration units for generation 
and  using  steam  from  cane  residues  at  high  temperature  and  pressure,  the  sugar  industry  can  produce 
electricity and steam to meet its entire energy demand, as well as surplus power in the range of 80 kWh/t of 
cane crushed� The capital cost of installing a bagasse-based cogeneration project is almost identical to the 
cost of a biomass power plant, in the range of USD 718 000-798 000/MW (INR 45 million-50 million/MW)� 
The cost of generation varies between USD 0�05-0�06/kWh (INR 3�25-3�75/kWh), depending on the plant’s 
load factor (PLF) and the interest rate on term loans� The average life of a biomass power plant is close to 20 
years, but can be extended to 30 with major restoration work�
While India’s potential for biomass-based energy is large, one of the major practical obstacles is the availability 
and acquisition of land� At least 5 acres (2 hectare) of land is required for approximately 5 MW of installed 
capacity of biomass power generation� Biomass power plants are most economically viable when they have 
a capacity of between 5 MW and 10 MW: a 5 MW plant requires an average input of 50 000 kg of biomass per 
day� Unlike other renewables, biomass requires large tracks of land for fuel storage� Yet just 2�14% of India’s 
total wastelands would suffice for 25 GW of biomass power�
However, collection, transporting and storing biomass often imposes significant added costs, and an absence 
of readily available input fuel and adequate storage space raises transport costs, further compounding the 
challenge of fuel linkages and transport� Our proposed mission suggests establishing multiple decentralised 
small scale biomass plants – which require relatively lower investment in both land and fuel – to counter these 
challenges�
Biomass  power  generating  units  provide  significant  economic  benefits  in  addition  to  the  electricity  they 
produce� A 10 MW project could create employment for about 100 workers during its 18-month construction 
phase, 25 full-time workers in operating the facility, and 35 people in collecting, processing, and transporting 
biomass material�
The recommendations below are made in the context of a proposed National Biomass Mission, with a target of 
25 GW of biomass power, including both cogeneration and power plants (The challenges to renewable energy 
scale-up identified in chapter 8 and the recommendations made in chapter 9 are also applicable to biomass)�
8 9
Promote the distributed biomass market to improve procurement. There is an abundant surplus of biomass 
available  in  India�  However,  high  collection  and  transport  costs  often  become  a  hindrance  in  executing 
biomass  power  generation  projects  effectively�  Instituting  district  biomass  markets,  to  which  agricultural 
residues and biomass collected from wastelands and forests can be brought for sale, would go a long way in 
addressing this gap� Such formal markets could enable larger producers to source their biomass easily from 
many of them at a time� Furthermore, easy access to biomass could encourage entrepreneurship and allow 
decentralised producers to set up plants� Pilot projects should be initiated in such key agricultural states, as 
Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, to test the viability of decentralised procurement 
and production of biomass-based energy�
Develop an information portal to catalogue and update biomass availability. Cataloguing can be done by 
crop type, region, season, calorific value, quality and price� Such information could be collected at a district 
level, with MNRE collating it within a usable platform� This could go a long way to increasing confidence in 
market dynamics for what is still a nascent sector�
Mandate biomass cogeneration in certain industries, such as the sugar industry. MNRE already provides 
several  incentives  for  bagasse  cogeneration  plants  such  as  accelerated  depreciation,  tax  holidays,  and 
exemption from excise duty� Such incentives, if combined with a minimum enforced requirement to meet 
captive demand from biomass, could drive growth in biomass cogeneration plants deployment�
Offer a FiT specific to biomass generation. Biomass power plants are lucrative only if a FiT is provided to 
the producer for units of energy fed into the grid� Estimates suggest that the cost of production stands at 
USD  0�06/kWh,  so  utilities  must  buy  each  unit  of  power  for  more  than  this�  Reverse  auctioning  could  be 
used to determine the lowest cost outlay from public funds� The National Clean Energy Fund could be used 
to finance the FiT, although state utilities could also contribute by including biomass cogeneration towards 
fulfilling their RPOs�
Rigorous  project  selection  criteria.  In  order  to  draw  serious  players  able  to  source  and  store  biomass, 
attract  financing  and  ensure  project  completion;  the  proposed  National  Biomass  Mission  should  have 
stringent guidelines for choosing projects in a reverse auction bidding process� Such guidelines are especially 
applicable for independent biomass power plants where the input has to be externally sourced, as opposed 
to the cogeneration units in the sugar industry where bagasse is available on site� The developer’s proposed 
provisions for the purchasing, transport and storage of biomass should be borne in mind when projects are 
allocated�
Offer government land (wastelands) or lease it at concessional rates for the lifetime of the project. Land 
availability poses a significant challenge, but it could be overcome if such schemes as leasing government 
land were instituted, similar to Rajasthan’s policy solar projects� The sale of a small proportion (e�g� a minimum 
of 5 acres) of wastelands to the developers of biomass projects should be mandatory in each administrative 
block of every state�
Establish renewable energy parks. Given the shortage of land available for harnessing renewables, mixed 
land use could be promoted� The same site would have multiple operating renewable energy systems – such 
as having biomass storage units with solar PV panels on their roofs – thus using the land in the most efficient 
way�
Research and Development of innovative gasification technology and hybrid crops. Funds allocated by 
MNRE to encourage research into gasifiers that have improved the efficiency or development of biomass 
polygeneration units could go a long way to boosting the biomass’ share of power in the Indian energy mix� 
Research into hybrid hardy seed types that can be grown in wasteland plantations should be encouraged, 
as this could solve the input fuel challenge faced by independent biomass plants� Grants worth USD 100 000 
could be instituted to assist researchers in such an endeavour�

This would be particularly helpful for co-financing 
projects;
increasing  the  efficiency  of  solar  panels  or  the 
durability  of  wind  turbines,  lowering  the  cost 
of  balancing  systems  (including  storage),  or  of 
distributed energy in areas that are hard to reach� 
Such targeted prizes could stimulate innovation 
in  technologies  and  business  models  with  the 
ultimate aim of increasing access to clean energy;
 ●
Particularly  focus  on  nexus  issues  (water  and 
energy); and
 ●
Improve  air  pollution  emission  standards  to  the 
level of those in developed countries�
 ●
Support  partnerships:  Policies  that  support 
north-south  and  south-south  co-operation  in 
the  form  of  joint  research  and  development, 
international funding of domestic research, tied 
project  funding  for  piloting  new  technologies 
etc�  help  in  furthering  the  available  renewable 
energy  technology�  Partnerships  like  the  Joint 
Clean Energy Research and Development Centre 
between  India  and  the  US  lead  to  a  significant 
commitment to research and development� This 
partnership  committed  USD  50  million,  equally 
shared  by  the  two  countries,  for  research  on 
efficient  buildings,  second  generation  biofuels, 
and  solar  energy�  The  government  funding 
was  augmented  by  joint  research  consortia 
contributing the equivalent of USD 75 million;
9�5  Unleashing innovation
Renewable  energy  deployment  around  the  world  is 
continuously  benefiting  from  innovation,  whether 
in  technological  improvements,  new  applications  of 
existing  technologies,  new  business  and  financing 
models, or innovative and inclusive policy mechanisms� 
India, with its endemic problem of access to energy, has 
seen  much  innovation  in  low  cost  renewable  energy 
applications  and  constantly  evolving  distribution  and 
financing models� It should:
 ●
Develop  building  codes  in  cities  to  include 
renewable energy standards for all new buildings 
developed  as  part  of  a  housing  complex� 
Guidelines  could  include  mandatory  district 
cooling  systems,  solar  water  heating,  energy 
efficient lighting etc�;
 ●
Develop  a  government  approved  crowdfunding 
platform�  Such  a  platform  for  distributed 
renewable  energy  projects  ratified  by  MNRE 
would help project developers raise finance and 
would build investor confidence, as the projects 
would have government clearance� Such a portal 
could  bridge  the  gap  between  financiers  and 
small developers; and
 ●
Promote  technological  development  in  energy 
storage,  water  saving  technologies  for  CSP 
plants, energy monitoring and devices for system 
balance�  Policies  that  promote  and  incentivise 
technological  advances  in  these  fields,  both 
domestically and in the form of joint research, are 
crucial for the long term scaling up of renewable 
energy in India;
 ●
Additional  measures  can  include:  instituting 
an  energy  access  prize  to  drive  innovation  in 
decentralised  generation;  the  government 
partnering  with  energy  efficient  economies 
to  develop  best-practices  to  reduce  growing 
demand;  exploring  additional  partnerships  on 
energy  storage  R&D,  energy  service  company 
business models; and developing a coalition for 
low-carbon  rural  development  (including  for 
agriculture, water, climate and livelihoods facing 
climate risks)�
 ●
Reward innovation and domestic manufacturing� 
In  the  light  of  the  Government’s  Make  in  India 
campaign,  an  effective  mechanism  to  support 
domestic  manufacturing  and 
in

ANNEX C: 
Details of REmap costing and external cost assessment methodologies
in  petroleum  prices;  advanced  biofuel  estimates 
originated  from  IRENA’s  own  estimates�  All  biomass 
feedstock  prices  are  based  on  IRENA  bottom-up 
analysis (IRENA, 2014c)� Electricity prices were assumed 
to increase 30% over 2010 levels, which is based on the 
average price increase of conventional energy carriers, 
but also taking into account the changes in the fuel mix 
of the power sector with renewables�
Two  examples  are  provided  to  explain  how  the 
substitution costs are estimated:
 ●
Biomass  boiler  substituting  LPG-based  boiler: 
The  difference  between  the  annualised  capital, 
operation  and  maintenance  and  energy  costs 
of  the  two  boiler  systems  to  deliver  the  same 
amount  of  heat  are  estimated,  thereby  taking 
into  account  the  conversion  efficiency,  size  of 
capacity,  lifetime,  capacity  factors,  etc�  This  is 
divided by the total final biomass demand of the 
boiler required to deliver that heat�
In the government case, for coal, India was assumed to 
largely remain a domestic producer, therefore the lower 
price  option  was  used�  Electricity  prices  are  based  on 
national  prices  as  described  in  the  business  case,  but 
with the effect of taxes removed� For natural gas India 
was  assumed  to  be  an  importer  of  natural  gas  and 
the higher price was used� Natural gas and coal prices 
were based on import/export price estimates from the 
IEA  (2012)�  Petroleum  prices  are  standardised  for  the 
world  and  indexed  to  expected  developments  in  the 
price  of  crude  oil  based  on  IEA  (2012)�  Liquid  biofuel 
prices are IRENA estimates with the effect of taxes or 
subsidies removed� Biomass fuel prices are regionalised 
to the Asia (non-OECD) region�
 ●
Wind  power  substituting  existing  coal-based 
power:  The  difference  between  the  annualised 
capital,  operation  and  maintenance  and  energy 
costs  of  the  two  power  systems  to  deliver  the 
same amount of electricity are estimated, thereby 
taking into account the conversion efficiency, size 
of capacity, lifetime, capacity factors, etc� In the 
case of existing coal-based power, there are no 
capital  costs  as  the  capacity  is  assumed  to  be 
depreciated already� This difference is divided by 
the  total  renewable  electricity  generated  from 
the wind power capacity�
Two  detailed  methodology  document  are  available 
online  detailing  the  approach  used  to  calculated 
external cost and substitution costs, system costs, and 
investments:
For  the  business  case,  energy  prices  were  estimated 
based on a number of methods� For some multipliers, 
expected developments in energy prices for the period 
between  2010  and  2030  were  used  based  on  the  IEA 
projections  and  these  were  applied  to  national  2010 
prices� For the case of coal, import prices were used; for 
natural gas, Asian regional import prices were used; for 
oil products, IEA crude oil import price projections were 
used (IEA, 2012)� For conventional liquid biofuel prices, 
growth in price was matched to expected development

Note: Reference Case 2030 + REmap Options = REmap 2030
1) 
 Reference case is based largely on Planning Commission 2014 (BiG scenario)� The reference case for the power sector incorporates targets 
based on the Twelfth Five-Year Plan to 2017; exceptions are for Solar PV (see note 8), wind (see note 2), and biopower (based on IRENA 
assessments)�
 The Reference Case assumes reaching a 60 GW target by 2019, and continued linear growth until 2030� This would result in just under 8 GW 
capacity additions per year between 2015 and 2030� Recent wind capacity installations have exceed 3 GW per year, so a significant increase� 
For REmap yearly capacity additions increase by 25% to 10 GW year� REmap Options also include 14 GW additional to meet the increased 
electricity demand in end-use sectors in REmap 2030 
 Reference case and REmap Options are based on a mix of sources compiled by IRENA which are explained in more detail for each technology 
in footnotes 4-7�
 Based on van Ruijven, Schers and van Vuuren (2012), it is assumed in Reference Case that by 2030, more than 95% of all rural electrification 
needs (representing about 390 million people in 2030) are met compared to about 50% in 2010 levels� While all of this is possible by grid-
connection� Various renewable energy-based off-grid technologies can also play a role� Their potential and cost-effectiveness depends on the 
demand load and the capital costs relative to the grid & transmission costs� Potential of solar PV off-grid and wind/diesel mini-grid systems 
range from 1-100% according to the results of this study� In Reference Case, it is assumed that one-third of the total rural electrification needs 
can be met by off-grid/mini-grid systems� Assuming 250 kWh/household (5 capita/household), total power need of rural areas that do not 
yet have power access is equivalent to 19�5 TWh/yr, and 6�4 TWh/yr to be supplied by renewable energy off-grid systems� It is assumed that 
half of this total can be supplied by solar home systems (2�5 GW, capacity factor of 1 300 hours/year), forty percent by biomass systems that 
include gasifiers and biomethanation (0�8 GW, both with capacity factor of 3 100 hours/year), and the remainder ten percent by wind systems 
(0�3 GW, capacity factor of 2 000 hours/year)� With these developments, a total of 3�6 GW off-grid capacity would be installed in India by 
2030, compared to today’s level of 117 MW (end of March 2014) that is dominated mainly by solar home systems� Biomass gasifiers also play 
a role in urban areas (0�2 GW), in particular, in industrial systems, but in the Reference Case, about half of what their potential would be in 
rural areas�
 For REmap 2030, full power access is assumed that raise the total power needs to 21 TWh/year compared to 19�5 TWh/year in the Reference 
Case� It is assumed that half of this total demand would be met by off-grid/mini-grid systems with biomass gasifier and biomethanation 
systems accounting for forty percent of this total (1�4 GW installed capacity) and wind a quarter (1�3 GW)� The remainder 35% would be 
provided by solar home systems (7�8 GW in total)�
 Solar systems also play a role for telecom towers that are growing in number in India� Today there are about 740 000 tower of which 70% 
are in areas of less than 16 hours grid supply� Total diesel consumption to ensure continues power supply today has reached 5�1 billion litres, 
and by 2030 it can reach about 8 billion per years to generate about 30 TWh per year electricity� There is a potential to substitute about 70% 
of the total power needs with off-grid systems that would require about 17 GW solar systems in 2030 (with capacity factor of about 1 750 
hours/year)�

 For power-alone solid biomass combustion systems, a total potential of about 23 GW is estimated, with 18 GW from agricultural/forestry 
residues  and  5  GW  from  energy  crops  (http://mnre.gov.in/schemes/grid-connected/biomass-powercogen/)�  However,  for  India’s  total 
biomass supply in 2030, IRENA has estimated no dedicated energy crop potential� Of this total 18 GW potential (based on today’s residue 
generation factors), a total of 10 GW is assumed for REmap 2030, compared to 1 GW capacity in 2010/2011� For the Reference Case, total 
installed capacity is assumed as 3 GW�
 For waste-to-power systems, the potential today is about 4 GW (based on today’s waste generation factors)� For REmap 2030, 4 GW is 
assumed that would be much less than the potential in 2030 given India’s increasing population and economic growth that would result in 
a higher volumes of waste being generated�
 In 2010/2011, total installed cogeneration capacity in India’s sugar mills was about 1�9 GW (electric-capacity)� These plants generate about 
6 TWh/yr, based on a capacity factor of 35% (considering both on-season and off-season, and based on mills in Uttar Pradesh), total power 
generation of 85 kWh per tonne of bagasse� A total of 80 Mt/yr wet bagasse is produced (with a lower heating value of approximately 
7-8 MJ/kg), of which 70 Mt is used for captive power generation� Information about total heat production from cogeneration plants is limited, 
one  source  (http://www.cercind.gov.in/2009/July09/Presentations-by-22-07-09/Presentation-Indian-SugaR-Mill-Associations.pdf)  states 
around 5 (power-to-heat of 0�2) but that in the actual situation it is likely lower, so an order of 7 compared to total power generation (so a 
power-to-heat ratio of about 0�15) is assumed�
 According to Vision 2030 for sugar industry, total sugar cane production would grow to 520 Mt/yr by 2030� This would generate 120 Mt/yr 
wet bagasse� Based on today’s level of wet bagasse use for power cogeneration (70 out of 80 Mt wet bagasse), this would have a potential 
to install 5�1 GW power capacity (at slightly improved efficiency levels and using 100 Mt/yr wet bagasse) in the Reference Case� An additional 
1 GW biomass-fired (non-bagasse) CHP capacity is assumed for distillery, dairies and rice mills which today have a combined CHP potential 
of 4 GW (Singh, Singh and Mahla, 2013), or about 8 GW by 2030 with total industrial energy use doubling in India between 2010 and 2030�
 In REmap 2030, efficiency is double compared to today’s levels, but less bagasse is used since a share of the total generated is allocated to 
advanced biofuels production (80 Mt/yr with the remainder 20 Mt being used for advanced biofuel production); this results in 6 GW power 
generation capacity in REmap 2030� Half of the potential in non-bagasse sectors (4 GW) is assumed in addition that take the total industrial 
biomass-fired CHP capacity to 10 GW (running with a capacity factor of about 4 300 hours/year, and a power-to-heat ratio of 0�25)� 
 Reference Case assumes achieving a 20 GW target by 2022, and an installation rate of just over 3 GW/year in the 2022-2030 timeframe� It 
does not include the recently proposed 100 GW target by 2022, which is accounted for instead in the REmap options, which then assumes 
growth rate increase from 12 GW/year to 15 GW/year for the time period 2022-2030� This would result in yearly capacity additions of just over 
13 GW� Share of utility-scale (80%) and distributed generation (20%) are estimated based on an IRENA assessment� REmap Options include 
an additional 14 GW additional capacity of utility-scale solar PV to meet the increased electricity demand in end-use sectors in REmap 2030�
 REmap Options based on IRENA Assessment�

10)   REmap Options based on CEEW�
11)  
 Reference Case and REmap 2030 estimates for the building sector are based on CEEW� For the industry sector, estimates are based on 
IRENA’s Renewable Energy in Manufacturing report and assume that some low and medium temperature heat (less than 400 oC) can be met 
with solar thermal that would account for about 1% of the total energy needs for process heat generation� Compared to total demand this 
may be a low number, but given the growing size of India’s manufacturing industry, the absolute volume of solar thermal heaters installed is 
significant�
 For buildings, solar cookers account for 5% of the total substitution of traditional use of biomass in the Reference Case that would require 
10 GW (14 million m2 or 3-4 million solar cookers, based on 10% capacity factor) capacity in REmap 2030� By 2017 the target is to have 
3�5 million home units, 0�5 school units, 0�05 community cooking units� The remainder of solar thermal is additional capacity for heating 
(83 GW) and cooling (1�7 GW) that represents about 4% of building sector’s TFEC� Heating is predominantly for water heating whereas solar 
cooling substitutes 0�03% of the total power use of air conditioning systems in 2030 (700 TWh/yr compared to total building power demand 
of 1 450 TWh/yr)�
 
12)    Reference Case is estimated based on 2010 IEA energy balance with no increase in heat production in the Reference Case� REmap option is 
based on IRENA RE in manufacturing assessment�
13)    In Reference Case 2030, total traditional and modern uses of biomass increase only slightly by 5% compared to total fuel demand growth of 
the building sector of 63% between 2010 and 2030, with no change in their share of the total building biomass use� Hence, a considerable 
share of the total traditional uses of biomass are being substituted with LPG/kerosene� In REmap 2030, full substitution of traditional uses 
of biomass is assumed with a mix of modern biomass technologies and solar cookers (see footnote 11 for solar cookers)� Gasifiers and biogas 
plants that are already used in large amounts would account for 45% of the total modern biomass needs (about 30% conversion efficiency) 
and another half would come from solid biomass use in modern cookstoves (25% conversion efficiency)�
14)    To  substitute  4�2  EJ  of  traditional  uses  of  bioenergy  REmap  assumes  0�58  EJ  modern  biogas  cookstoves,  0�8  EJ  modern  solid  biomass 
cookstoves, and 0�1 EJ of biomass gasification� Based on these fuel demand, total cookstove capacity is calculated assuming a 15% capacity 
factor and 25-30% stove conversion efficiency� Then this total capacity is divided for each category of cookstove by an average cookstove 
unit capacity to arrive at the number of cookstoves shown in the table�
15)    Biomass (total of bagasse and non-bagasse) used for industrial CHP is estimated based on the total power generation explained in footnote 
7, based on the power-to-heat ratio assumptions� Total biomass use for industrial process heating is estimated based on energy allocation 
of total fuel input to CHPs and the power and heat output� Biogas and biomass gasification is estimated based on IRENA’s manufacturing 
industry report� No additional solid biomass use is estimated beyond the Reference Case that provide process heat for a wide range of 
process heat applications in India’s manufacturing industry (covering 12% of India manufacturing industry’s total fuel demand in REmap 
2030)�
16)    Model shift is a structural change in the transport sector� Two options are considering: Electrified city trams instead of personal passenger 
diesel/petrol automobiles accounting for around 400 billion passenger kilometres per year (5% of road passenger kilometres); and high 
speed rail instead of passenger aviation accounting for around 160 billion passenger kilometres per year (XX share of passenger domestic 
flight kilometres)�
17)    Reference case based on 2% blending requirement by 2030; REmap 2030 based on 15% blending requirements in both diesel & gasoline�
18)   IRENA own estimates of supply based on IRENA (2014)
19) 
 TFEC growth in the Reference Case is based on the Planning Commission BiG Scenario for all sectors and energy carriers except biomass 
(based on an IRENA assessment) and oil product use in buildings (based on IEA WEO)
20)   Power capacity for rural electrification includes off-grid and mini-grid systems� Capacity shown here is in addition to capacity in the grid 
connected categories above� 
 Electric vehicle assumptions are based on projected annual road passenger kilometres by 2030 of 10 800 billion� Of this 65% is served by 
2/3 wheelers, 18% by 4 wheel automobiles, and 18% by public bus and mini-bus� For these segments the REmap options assume a 30% 
penetration of battery electric 2/3 wheelers, 20% of 4 wheel BEV, and 18% of public electric buses�
