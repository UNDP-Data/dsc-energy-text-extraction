PREAMBLE FOR NATIONAL ELECTRICITY PLAN, 2015 
 
Section 3(4) of Electricity Act, 2003 stipulates that, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) shall prepare a National 
Electricity Plan in accordance with the National Electricity Policy and notify such plan once in five years. 
 
Provided that the Authority while preparing the National Electricity Plan shall publish the draft National Electricity Plan 
and invite suggestions and objections thereon from licensees, generating companies and the public within such time as 
may be prescribed: 
Provided further that the Authority shall –  
a)  Notify the plan after obtaining the approval of the Central Government;  
b)  Revise  the  plan  incorporating  therein  the  directions,  if  any,  given  by  the  Central  Government  while 
granting approval under clause (a). 
Further  Section  3(5)  of  said  act  stipulates  that,  the  Authority  may  review  or  revise  the  National  Electricity  Plan  in 
accordance with the National Electricity Policy.  
 
Para  3  of  National  Electricity  Policy,  2005  stipulates  that,  assessment  of  demand  is  an  important  pre-requisite  for 
planning  capacity  addition.  Also,  section  73  (a)  of  the  Electricity  Act  provides  that  formulation  of  short-term  and 
perspective plans for development of the electricity system and coordinating the activities of various planning agencies 
for the optimal utilization of resources to sub serve the interests of the national economy shall be one of the functions 
of the CEA. The Plan prepared by CEA and approved by the Central Government can be used by prospective generating 
companies, transmission utilities and transmission/distribution licensees as reference document. 
 
Accordingly, CEA shall prepare the National Electricity Plan that would be for a short-term framework of five years 
while giving a 15-year perspective and would include: 
  Short-term and long term demand forecast for different regions; 
  Suggested areas/locations for capacity additions in generation and transmission keeping in view the economics 
of generation and transmission, losses in the system, load centre requirements, grid stability, security of supply, 
quality of power including voltage profile etc. and environmental considerations including rehabilitation and 
resettlement; 
Integration of such possible locations  with transmission system and development of national grid including 
type of transmission systems and requirement of redundancies; and  
 
 
 
 
  Different technologies available for efficient generation, transmission and distribution. 
  Fuel choices based on economy, energy security and environmental considerations. 
 
While evolving the National Electricity Plan, CEA will consult all the stakeholders including State Governments and 
the  State  Governments  would,  at  state  level,  undertake  this  exercise  in  coordination  with  stakeholders  including 
distribution licensees and State Transmission Utilities (STUs). While conducting studies periodically to assess short-
term and long-term demand, projections made by distribution utilities would be given due weightage. CEA will also 
interact  with  institutions  and  agencies  having  economic  expertise,  particularly  in  the  field  of  demand  forecasting. 
Projected growth rates for different sectors of the economy will also be taken into account in the exercise of demand 
forecasting. 
 
Accordingly,  the  first  National  Electricity  Plan  covering  the  review  of  10th  plan,  detailed  plan  for  11th  plan  and 
perspective Plan for 12th Plan was notified in the Gazette in August, 2007. 
 
The Second National Electricity Plan covering the review of 11th plan, detailed plan for 12th plan and perspective Plan 
for 13th plan was notified in the Gazette in December, 2013 in two volumes (Volume-I, Generation and Volume-II, 
Transmission). 
 
Inputs from report of Working Group on Power set up by erstwhile Planning Commission headed by Secretary (Power), 
MOP were used during the formulation of National Electricity Plan. Planning Commission has been replaced with NITI

Government  of  India  has  set  up 
the 
target  of  175  GW  for

technology is evolving compared 
to  the  mature  technology  of

Setting up of coal based plants is

It  is  suggested  that  the  National  Electricity 
Plan should not keep capacity addition static 
for  coal-based  generation,  but  should  lower

It has been stated that presently, existing gas-
based power plants are operating at very low 
PLF  (23%)  and  few  gas-based  power  plants 
are lying idle due to non-availability of natural 
gas.    As  per  electrical  demand  projects  by

to  operate  at  23%  PLF.    This  is  matter  for

MAJOR HIGHLIGHTS 
The actual capacity addition during 12th Plan from conventional sources as on 31st March,2017 is 99,209.6 
MW (Coal 83,560 MW, Lignite 1,290 MW, Gas 6,880.5 MW, Hydro 5,479 MW, Nuclear 2,000 MW) 
against a target of 88,537 MW. This is about 112% of the target. 
56 % of total capacity addition during 12th plan has come from private sector. 
There has been considerable slippage against the capacity addition target in respect of Hydro (5,451 MW) 
and Nuclear (3,300 MW) during the 12th Plan period.    
During 12th plan, capacity addition from supercritical technology based coal power plants is around 42% 
of the total capacity addition from coal based plants. 
R&M/LE works in respect of 37 Nos. thermal units with aggregate capacity of 7,202.6 MW have been 
completed during 12th Plan up to 31st March,2017. Also about 4014.6 MW of Hydro capacity has been 
achieved through uprating, life extension and restoration activities for a total of 20 hydro R&M schemes 
up to 31st March,2017.  
As on 31st March,2017, India has achieved a total installed capacity of 57,244.24 MW from Renewable 
Energy Sources.  
By 2021-22, the Renewable Energy capacity target has been set to 175 GW. 
 A capacity addition of 32,741 MW from Renewable Energy Sources has been achieved during 12th Plan.  
Total energy savings due to implementation of various energy saving measures during the years 2021-22 
and 2026-27 are estimated to be 249 BU and 337 BU respectively.  
As per the 19th Electric Power Survey, the projected Peak Demand is 226 GW and Energy requirement is 
1,566 BU at the end of year 2021-22. 
As per the 19th EPS report, the projected Peak Demand is 299 GW and Energy requirement is 2047 BU at 
the end of year 2026-27. 
Considering the demand projections for the year 2021-22 as per the 19th EPS (where CAGR works out to 
be 6.18%), committed capacity addition from Gas 406 MW, Hydro 6,823 MW, Nuclear 3,300 MW, RES 
1,17,756 MW and likely retirement of 22,716 MW (5,927 MW-old and inefficient units + 16,789 MW-
completing 25 years by 2022 and without FGD space) of coal based capacity during 2017-22, the study 
result  reveals  that  coal  based  capacity  addition  of  6,445  MW  is  required  during  the  period  2017-22. 
However, a total capacity of 47,855 MW coal based power projects are currently under different stages of 
construction and are likely to yield benefits during the period 2017-22. Thereby, the total capacity addition 
during 2017-22 is likely to be 1,76,140 MW. 
An alternate scenario has also been constructed, considering demand CAGR of 7.18% during the years 
2017-22  and  keeping  other  parameters  unchanged.  It  was  found  that  19,700  MW  coal  based  capacity 
addition would then be required during the years 2017-22, in case of increased demand scenario. However, 
coal based capacity of 47,855 MW are at different stages of construction and are likely to yield benefit 
during 2017-22. The PLF % of coal based power stations will therefore increase substantially. However 
all the requirements mentioned in the highlights are based on the demand projections as per 19th EPS. 
Considering the demand projections for the year 2026-27, as per the 19th EPS, coal based capacity addition 
of 47,855 MW already under construction for benefits during 2017-22, committed capacity addition of 
Nuclear 6,800 MW, Hydro 12,000 MW, RES 1,00,000 MW and likely retirement of 25,572 MW of coal 
based capacity (which will be completing more than 25 years of age by 2027) during 2022-27, the study 
results reveal that capacity addition of 46,420 MW is required during the period 2022-27. This capacity 
addition required during 2022-27, as shown in the results is, in fact, the peaking capacity requirement to 
be  met  in  the  grid.  This  capacity  requirement  can  be  met  from  any  conventional  source  of  energy  but 
preferably from peaking power plants like Hydro, Gas or Energy Storage Devices. 
Considering the generation capacity addition mentioned in 13 and 14 above, the share of non-fossil based 
installed capacity (Nuclear + Hydro + Renewable Sources) will increase to 49.3 % by the end of 2021-22 
and will further increase to 57.4% by the end of 2026-27. 
The Renewable Energy Generation will contribute about 20.1 % and 24.4 % of the total energy in 2021-
22 and 2026-27 respectively.  
The total coal requirement in the year 2021-22 and 2026-27 has been estimated as 735 MT and 877 MT 
respectively including imported coal of 50 MT. The coal requirement for the year 2021-22 and 2026-27 
have been worked out considering 30% reduction in Hydro generation due to failure of monsoon and being 
supplemented by coal based generation.

Against a total domestic natural gas allocated to power projects of 87.05 MMSCMD, the total gas supplied 
to these gas based power plants during the year 2016-17 was only 29.59 MMSCMD. 
It has been estimated that the gas based stations shall need at least 45.27 MMSCMD of gas to meet the 
balancing  and  peaking  requirement  of  the  grid  arising  due  to  RES  integration.  If  the  storage  devices 
become economically viable in future, then they can also be used for the balancing. 
Adequate manufacturing facilities exist in India for main plant equipment. However, lack of orders is a 
concern of all equipment manufacturers.  
The total fund requirement for the period 2017-2022 is estimated to be ₹ 11,55,652 Crores, which also 
includes the likely expenditure during this period for the projects coming up in the year 2022-2027. 
The total fund requirement for the period 2022-27 is estimated to be 9,56,214 crores but does not include 
advance action for projects coming up during the period 2027-2032. 
The total CO2 emissions for the year 2021-22 and 2026-27 is estimated at 1026 Million Tonnes and 1173

The  average  CO2  emission  factor  is  estimated  at  0.721  kg  CO2/kWh  during  2015-16  (including 
renewables). It is expected that this average CO2 emission factor may reduce to 0.604 kg CO2/kWh by the 
end of year 2021-22 and to 0.524 kg CO2/kWh by the end of 2026-27, considering the projected addition 
of RES capacity. 
Emission intensity kgCO2/GDP (₹) from grid connected power stations is likely to reduce by 40.51% at 
the end of 2021-22 and 53.65 % at the end of 2026-27 from the year 2005 level. 
It is estimated that 20.69 Million Tonnes of CO2 emissions has been avoided by 31st March,2017 due to 
commissioning  of  Super-critical  technology  based  coal  power  plants  vis-à-vis  the  scenario  of  only

BACKGROUND 
 
Growth of Power sector is key to the economic development of the country as it facilitates development across various 
sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing, agriculture, commercial enterprises and railways. Since independence 
the  power  sector  in  India  has  grown  considerably.  However,  the  enactment  of  Electricity  Act,  2003,  has  brought  in 
revolutionary changes in almost all the areas of the sector.   Through this Act a conducive environment has been created 
to promote private sector participation and competition in the sector by providing a level playing field.  This has led to 
significant investment in generation, transmission and distribution areas. Over the years the installed capacity of Power 
Plants  (Utilities)  has  increased  to  3,26,833  MW  as  on  31.3.2017  from  a  meagre  1,713  MW  in  1950.  Similarly,  the 
electricity generation increased from about 5.1 Billion units in 1950 to 1,242 BU (including imports) in the year 2016-
17. The per capita consumption of electricity in the country has also increased from 15 kWh in 1950 to about 1,122 kWh 
in the year 2016-17. Out of 5,97,464 census villages, 5,92,135 villages (99.25%) have been electrified as on 31.03.2017. 
Regional grids have been integrated into a single national grid with effect from 31.12.2013 thereby providing free flow 
of power from one corner of the country to another through strong inter regional AC and HVDC links. As a result, the 
all India peak demand (MW) not met as well as energy (MU) not supplied have registered steady decline. The peak not 
met and energy not supplied were 1.6 % and 0.7 % respectively during the year 2016-17.

ELECTRICITY ACT 2003, NATIONAL ELECTRICITY POLICY 2005 AND TARIFF POLICY 2016 
 
1.1.1  Electricity Act 2003 and Stipulations Regarding National Electricity Plan 
  
The Electricity Act, 2003 provides an enabling legislation conducive to development of the Power Sector in transparent 
and competitive environment, keeping in view the interest of the consumers. 
 
As per Section 3(4) of the Electricity Act 2003, Central Electricity Authority (CEA) is required to prepare a National 
Electricity Plan in accordance with the National Electricity Policy and notify such Plan once in five years. The draft 
plan has to be published and suggestions and objections invited thereon from licensees, generating companies and the 
public within the prescribed time. The Plan has to be notified after obtaining the approval of the Central Government. 
The National Electricity Policy stipulates that the Plan prepared by CEA and approved by the Central Government can 
be used by prospective generating companies, transmission utilities and transmission/distribution licensees as a reference 
document. 
 
1.1.2 National Electricity Policy 2005 and Stipulations Regarding National Electricity Plan 
 
The Aims and Objectives of the National Electricity Policy are as follows: 
 
  Access to Electricity - Available for all households in next five years. 
  Availability  of  Power  -  Demand  to  be  fully  met  by  2012.  Energy  and  peaking  shortages  to  be  overcome  and 
adequate spinning reserve to be available.  
  Supply of Reliable and Quality Power of specified standards in an efficient manner and at reasonable rates.  
  Per capita availability of electricity to be increased to over 1000 units by 2012.  
  Minimum lifeline consumption of 1 unit/household/day as a merit good by year 2012.  
  Financial Turnaround and Commercial Viability of the Electricity Sector.  
  Protection of consumers’ interests.  
 
National Electricity Policy stipulates that the National Electricity Plan would be for a short-term framework of five years 
while giving a 15-year perspective and would include: 
 
  Short-term and long term demand forecast for different regions;  
  Suggested areas/locations for capacity additions in generation and transmission keeping in view of the economics 
of generation and transmission, losses in the system, load centre requirements, grid stability, security of supply, 
INTRODUCTION

quality  of  power  including  voltage  profile,  etc.;  and  environmental  considerations  including  rehabilitation  and 
resettlement;  
  Integration of such possible locations with transmission system and development of national grid including type of 
transmission systems and requirement of redundancies; 
 
  Different technologies available for efficient generation, transmission and distribution.  
  Fuel choices based on economy, energy security and environmental considerations. 
 
The  Policy  also  stipulates  that  while  evolving  the  National  Electricity  Plan,  CEA  will  consult  all  the  stakeholders 
including State Governments and the State Governments would, at State level, undertake this exercise in coordination 
with stakeholders including distribution licensees and State Transmission Utilities (STUs). While conducting studies 
periodically to assess short-term and long-term demand, projections made by distribution utilities would be given due 
weightage. CEA will also interact with institutions and agencies having economic expertise, particularly in the field of 
demand forecasting. Projected growth rates for different sectors of the economy will also be taken into account in the 
exercise of demand forecasting. 
 
The Policy stipulates that in addition to enhancing the overall availability of installed capacity to 85%, a spinning reserve 
of at least 5% at national level would be needed to be created to ensure grid security, quality and reliability of power 
supply.  
 
The  Policy  states  that  efficient  technologies,  like  super-critical  technology,  Integrated  Gasification  Combined  Cycle 
(IGCC) etc. and large size units would be gradually introduced for generation of electricity as their cost effectiveness 
gets established. 
 
The present National Electricity Policy was enunciated in 2005 and since then it’s various Aims and Objectives have 
achieved different levels of implementation. Keeping in view of these and to cater to the further challenges of the sector, 
the National Electricity Policy is under revision. 
  
1.1.3 Tariff Policy 2016  
 
The Central Government has notified the revised Tariff Policy vide Gazette notification dated 28.01.2016 in exercises 
of powers conferred under section 3(3) of Electricity Act, 2003. The Tariff Policy has been evolved in consultation with 
the State Governments, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and 
various stakeholders. 
The objectives of this Tariff Policy are to: 
1)  Ensure availability of electricity to consumers at reasonable and competitive rates; 
2)  Ensure financial viability of the sector and attract investments; 
3)  Promote transparency, consistency and predictability in regulatory approaches across jurisdictions and minimize 
perceptions of regulatory risks; 
4)  Promote competition, efficiency in operations and improvement in quality of supply; 
5)  Promote generation of electricity from renewable sources; 
6)  Promote hydroelectric power generation including Pumped Storage Projects (PSP) to provide adequate peaking 
reserves, reliable grid operation and integration of variable renewable energy sources; 
7)  Evolve a dynamic and robust electricity infrastructure for better consumer services;  
8)  Facilitate supply of adequate and uninterrupted power to all categories of consumers; 
9)  Ensure creation of adequate capacity including reserves in generation, transmission and distribution in advance, 
for reliability of supply of electricity to consumers.

1.2.5  Annual System Load Factor 
 
The Annual System Load Factor is the ratio of the energy availability in the system to the energy that would 
have been required during the year if the annual peak load met was incident on the system throughout the year. 
This factor depends on the pattern of utilization of different categories of load. The Annual System Load factor 
has remained close to 84% since 2011-12 till 2015-16, primarily because of prevailing energy shortages in the 
system and the load staggering measures adopted in the various States particularly in agriculture sector.  System 
Load factor has come down to 82.6% during 2016-17. Annual System Load Factor is as depicted in the Exhibit 
1.6.

1.2.6  Reserve Margin and Hydro Thermal Mix 
 
Reserve  margin  of  a  system  is  defined  as  the  difference  between  the  Installed  Capacity  and  the  peak  load  met  as  a 
percentage of the peak load met. This factor depends on a number of parameters, major ones being the mode of power 
generation i.e. hydro, thermal, renewable and the availability of the generating stations which primarily is a function of 
forced and planned shutdown of the generating units, capacity of the Discoms to procure power. The Reserve Margin 
has increased from 50.94% in 2011-12 to 71.78% in March, 2017. 
 
The Hydro-Thermal mix has been decreasing from 22.86% as on 31st March, 2012 to 16.92% in March, 2017 mainly 
due to reduced hydro capacity addition vis –a –vis thermal capacity addition during successive years. Pattern of reserve 
margin and hydro thermal mix is illustrated in the Exhibit 1.7.   
 
This increase in Reserve Margin is on account of decrease in thermal PLF from 73.32 % in 2011-12 to 59.88 % in 2016-
17.

VARIOUS INITIATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT 
 
1.3.1 Development of Power Projects On Tariff Based Bidding   
 
Promotion of competition in the electricity industry in India is one of the key objectives of the Electricity Act, 2003 (the 
Act).    Competitive  procurement  of  electricity  by  the  distribution  licensees  is  expected  to  reduce  the  overall  cost  of 
procurement of power and facilitate development of power markets.    
 
Section 61 & 62 of the Act provide for tariff regulation and determination of tariff of generation, transmission, wheeling 
and retail sale of electricity by the Appropriate Commission.  Section 63 of the Act states that –  
 
“Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 62, the Appropriate Commission shall adopt the tariff if such tariff has 
been  determined  through  transparent  process  of  bidding  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines  issued  by  the  Central 
Government.”  
 
Tariff Policy was revised on 28th January, 2016 to facilitate procurement of power on tariff based bidding. As per the 
revised Tariff Policy “All future requirement of power should continue to be procured competitively by distribution 
licensees except in case of expansion of existing projects or where there is a company owned or controlled by the State 
Government as an identified developer and where regulator will need to restore to tariff determination based on norms 
provided that expansion of generation capacity by private developers for this purpose would be restricted to one time 
addition of not more than 100% of the existing capacity”. Power projects can be developed by States under Case I and 
Case II bidding as follows: 
 
(i)  Where the location, technology or fuel is not specified by the procurer (Case 1); 
(ii) 
For hydro-power projects, load centre projects or other location specific projects with specific fuel allocation 
such as captive mines available, which the procurer intends to set up under tariff based bidding process (Case 
2) 
 
The Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) for Case-2/UMPPs were reviewed and the Model Bidding Documents for 
construction and operation of power generation projects/Ultra Mega Power Projects(UMPPs) on Design, Build, Finance, 
Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) basis were issued on 20th Sept, 2013.  Further, Ministry of Power has appointed an 
Expert Committee to review the Standard / Model Bidding Documents for UMPPs and other location specific projects 
under Case-2 route. The Expert Committee, after exhaustive deliberations/discussions with various stakeholders, has

prepared revised SBDs and Guidelines for UMPPs based on allocated Domestic Coal Blocks and submitted the same to 
the Ministry of Power and the same is under the process of Inter-Ministerial consultations. The   Expert Committee has 
also submitted its recommendation for comments from various stakeholders and guidelines for determination of tariff 
through UMPPs on imported coal. 
 
 
 
Ministry of Power had issued SBDs for Case-1 power projects on 27th March,2009. The revised SBDs containing Model 
RFQ,  Model  RFP,  Model  Power  Sale  Agreement  as  well  as  Guidelines  to  be  adopted  by  distribution  licensees  for 
procurement  of  electricity  on  Design,  Build,  Finance,  Own  and  Operate  (DBFOO)  basis  were  issued  on  8th 
November,2013 and 9th November,2013 respectively. Further, in order to ensure that the benefits of coal block auction 
are passed on to the consumers, amendments to these Guidelines have been issued vide Resolution No. 23/09/2015-
R&R dated 16th April, 2015. 
 
1.3.2 Development of Ultra Mega Power Projects  
 
For the development of coal based Ultra Mega Power Projects (UMPPs) of about 4,000 MW capacity each under tariff 
based competitive bidding route using Supercritical Technology on build, own and operate basis was launched by the 
Central Government in 2005-06.  The UMPPs will be located either at pit head based on domestic coal or at coastal 
locations based on imported coal.  For UMPPs based on domestic coal, coal block will also be allocated to the project 
developer.  
 
 The objective is to achieve faster capacity addition and to minimize the cost of power to consumers due to economy of 
scale.  Four UMPPs were awarded to the developers selected through tariff based competitive bidding which are Mundra 
UMPP in Gujarat, Sasan UMPP in MP, Krishnapatnam UMPP in AP and Tilaiya  UMPP in Jharkhand.  All  units of 
Mundra  UMPP  (5X800  MW)  and  Sasan  UMPP  (6X660  MW)  have  been  commissioned.  The  developer  of 
Krishnapatnam Ultra Mega Power Project, namely M/s Coastal Andhra Power Ltd (CAPL), had started the construction 
work but has stopped the construction work citing new regulation of the Government of Indonesia as the reason which 
prohibits sale of coal, including sale to affiliate companies, below bench mark price.   Andhra Pradesh Southern Power 
Distribution  Company  Limited  (APSPDCL),  who  is  the  lead  procurer  from  Krishnapatnam  Project  has  issued 
termination notice to Coastal Andhra Power Limited (CAPL).  CAPL had approached the High Court of Delhi.  The 
Delhi High Court has dismissed the petition of CAPL on 2nd July,2012. CAPL has approached Division Bench, Delhi 
High Court as well as Indian Arbitrator Council for arbitration.  The matter is subjudice. 
For Tilaiya UMPP, the developer (Jharkhand Integrated Power Ltd, a subsidiary of RPL) has issued notice of termination 
of  Power  Purchase  Agreement  on  28th  April,2015  citing  non  transfer  of  land  to  the  developer  by  the  Jharkhand 
Government.  Procurers  have  accepted  the  termination  notice  in  November,2015  and  after  transfer  of  SPV  (Special 
Purpose  Vehicle),  necessary  development  activities  for  re-bidding  would  be  started  as  per  revised  standard  bidding 
documents(SBDs).  
 
Four more UMPPs (Bedabahal in Odisha, Cheyyur in Tamil Nadu, Kakwara in Bihar, Husainabad in Jharkhand) have 
been identified for bidding process. 
 
In addition, five other UMPPs, one in Uttar Pradesh, two additional UMPPs in Orissa, second UMPP in Gujarat and 
second  UMPP  in  Tamil  Nadu  are  in  various  stages  of  planning.  The  selection/investigation  of  sites  for  the  above 
mentioned additional UMPPs are in process of consultation with the concerned State Governments.  
 
Broad status of UMPPs is placed at Annexure 1.1. 
 
1.3.3 Allocation of Captive Coal Blocks/Mines 
 
The coal production in the country had not been keeping pace with the increasing demand of the power sector due to 
various reasons, major one being delay in development of coal mines in the country. This had necessitated the need to 
import coal. Therefore, it has been decided to allocate coal blocks to project developers for captive use. All UMPPs at 
pithead have been allocated coal blocks. 
 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in its judgment dated 25th August,2014 and Order dated 24th September,2014 had 
declared allocations of 204 Coal Blocks out of 218 Coal Blocks made since 1993 as illegal. In compliance to the above 
Supreme Court Order dated 24th September,2014, 9 coal mines in power sector for the linked end use power plant have

The Government has recently taken several initiatives to facilitate expansion of nuclear power in the country like creation 
of the Indian Nuclear Insurance Pool (INIP), Amendment of the Atomic Energy Act to enable Joint Venture companies 
of Public Sector Enterprises to set up nuclear power plants. In the 2016-17 budget speech, the Finance Minister has also 
announced that the Government is drawing  up a comprehensive plan,  spanning  next 15 to 20 years, to augment the 
investment in nuclear power generation and provision for Budgetary allocation. The announcement has given an impetus 
for accelerating the nuclear capacity addition in the country. A road map in respect of indigenous Pressurised Heavy 
Water  Reactors  (PHWR)  is  being  drawn  up  as  a  part  of  the  comprehensive  plan  on  nuclear  capacity  addition.  The 
Government had already accorded “in principle” approval for various new sites/expansion of existing site for setting up 
indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR), imported Light Water Reactors (LWRs) and PFBRs.  
 
1.3.8 
Power for All 
 
Government of India has taken a  joint initiative  with respective State Governments  for preparation of State specific 
documents for providing 24x7 Power for All (PFA) to all households/homes, industrial & commercial consumers and 
adequate supply of power to agricultural consumer as per State Policy. This initiative aims at ensuring uninterrupted 
supply of quality power to existing consumers and providing electricity access to all unconnected consumers by 2019 
in a phased manner. 
 
In these PFA documents, an assessment of energy required to provide 24x7 Power for All connected and unconnected 
consumers, adequacy of availability of power to the State from various generating sources, Inter State Transmission 
System,  Intra  State  Transmission  System  and  distribution  system  to  ensure  24x7  power  supply  is  being  made.  The 
development of Renewable Energy (RE) plan and Energy Efficiency (EE) potential in the States are also being included 
in this document. 
 
This  joint  initiative  of  Government  of  India  and  State  Governments  aims  to  enhance  the  satisfaction  levels  of  the 
consumers,  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  people,  and  increase  the  economic  activities  resulting  into  inclusive 
development of the States. 
 
State Specific Documents for the all the States/UTs have been approved by the respective State Governments and signed 
by State & Central Government for implementation. 
 
The  Central  and  State  Governments  are  meeting  regularly  to  review  the  progress  of  the  Roll  Out  Plan  &  related 
milestones envisaged in the documents and respective Governments would strive to achieve the objectives by taking the 
necessary steps. 
 
1.3.9 
Initiatives Taken by Government of India in Distribution Sector  
 
Distribution is the most important link in the entire power sector value chain.  As the only interface between utilities 
and consumers, it is the cash register for the entire sector. Under the Indian Constitution, power is a concurrent subject 
and the responsibility for distribution and supply of power to rural and urban consumers rests with the States. However,

1.3.9.3  UDAY (Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana) Scheme for Operational and Financial Turnaround of Power 
Distribution Companies. 
Ministry  of  Power  vide  Office  Memorandum  dated  20th  November  2015,  announced  UDAY  (Ujwal  DISCOM 
Assurance  Yojana),  a  Scheme  for  the  Financial  Turnaround  o f  P o we r   Di s t r i b u t io n   C o mp a n i e s  
( D I S C O M s ).  T h e  s c h e me  h a s  b ee n  a p p r o v e d  b y t h e  Government of India with an objective to improve 
the operational  and  financial  efficiency of the State DISCOMs. The focus of UDAY Scheme is on States taking 
over the debt of State owned Discoms. Under the  scheme, States were to take over 75% of DISCOM debt as on 30 
September 2015 over two years - 50% in 2015-16 and 25% in 2016-17. States were to issue non-SLR (non- statutory 
liquidity ratio) including SDL (State Development Loans) bonds in the market or directly to the respective banks 
/ Financial Institutions (Fls) holding the DISCOM debt to the appropriate extent. Non-SLR bonds issued by the 
State will have a maturity period of 10 -15 years with a moratorium on repayment of principal up to 5 years, 
as required by the State. 
DISCOM debt to be taken over by the State  includes DISCOM bonds which are committed to be taken over by the 
State  as  part  of  Financial  Restructuring  Plan  (FRP)  2012.  FRP  Scheme  was  approved  and  notified  by  the  Central 
Government in October 2012, to enable financial turnaround of State Discoms. Bonds already taken over in the year 
2015-16 are covered as part of the scheme.  Jharkhand and Jammu & Kashmir are given special dispensation to borrow 
₹ 7,431 crore and ₹ 2,140 crore respectively to clear the provisional outstanding  dues of various CPSUs as 
on  30th  Sept,  2015  in  the  financial  year  2015-16  itself.  Debt  taken  over  by  the  State  and  borrowings  by 
Jharkhand  and  J&K  under  this  scheme  would  not  be  counted  against  the  fiscal  deficit  limit  of  respective 
State in the financial years 2015-16 and 2016-17. 
As per the UDAY scheme, for improving operational efficiencies, the participating States and utilities would 
have  to  follow  the  specified  timeline  of  the  targeted  activities  e.g.  Compulsory  feeder  and  Distribution 
Transformer  (DT)  metering  by  States,  Consumer  Indexing  &  GIS  Mapping  of  losses,  Upgrade  or  change 
transformers, meters etc. Smart  metering  of  all  consumers  consuming  above  200  units  /  month,  Demand  Side 
Management (DSM), Quarterly tariff revision, campaign to check power theft, Assure increased power supply in areas 
where the AT&C losses reduce. 
In addition, the outcomes of operational improvements is measured through following indicators: 
a) Reduction of AT&C loss to 15% in 2018-19 as per the loss reduction trajectory to be finalized by 
Ministry of Power (MoP) and States, and 
b) Reduction in gap between Average Cost of Supply (ACS) & Average Revenue Realized (ARR) to zero 
by 2018-19 as finalized by MoP and States. 
States accepting the scheme and performing as per operational milestones are given additional / priority funding through 
DDUGJY, IPDS, Power Sector Development Fund (PSDF) or other such schemes of MoP and MNRE. Such States are 
supported with additional coal at notified prices and, in case of availability through higher capacity utilization, low cost 
power from NTPC and other Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs). States not meeting operational milestones 
are liable to forfeit their claims on DDUGJY & IPDS grants.  
Ministry of Power subsequently issued the Office Memorandum dated 13.01.2016 regarding (i) Participation by State 
Power  Departments  (those  involved  in  distribution  of  electricity  as  unbundled  State  Electricity  Boards  and;  (ii) 
Participation by States where DISCOMs are not financially stressed, for improvement in operational efficiency. It is 
mentioned in this OM that in case of State Power Departments, the issue of State takeover of debts does not arise and in 
case of States where DISCOMs are not financially distressed, there is no need for State to take over DISCOM debts. In 
regard to these cases, it is further stated in this Office Memorandum that States may also enter into bipartite/tripartite

To promote the development of Smart Grid in the country, Government of India has launched ‘National Smart Grid 
Mission (NSGM)’ on 27th March,2015 for planning,  monitoring and implementation of policies & programs related 
to development of Smart Grid in India. 
The total estimated cost for NSGM activities for 12th plan is ₹ 980 crores including a budgetary support of ₹ 338 crores. 
Under NSGM, 30% funding will be provided for the development of Smart Grid in selected Smart Cities in the country 
along with development of micro grid in the country. 100% funding is also proposed for training & capacity building 
and consumer engagement etc.   
Smart Grid Projects at Chandigarh worth ₹ 28.58 crores, at Amravati (Maharashtra) worth ₹ 90.05 crores, at Congress 
Nagar (Nagpur) worth ₹ 139.15 crores and at Kanpur worth ₹ 319.57 crores have been sanctioned under NSGM. The 
National Smart Grid Mission Project Management Unit (NPMU) is handholding States for speeding up development of 
Smart Grid Network in the country. 
 
1.3.9.5  Creation of   National Electricity Fund (NEF) for Distribution Scheme 
 
Investment in Sub-transmission and distribution has been lacking due to resource crunch being experienced by the State 
transmission and distribution  utilities. The break-up of the generation and transmission & distribution schemes shall 
normally be 50:50. However, more investment is taking place in generation and investment in intra-state transmission 
system and distribution system has been much less than the desired proportion.   
Government  of  India  has  approved  the  NEF  (Interest  Subsidy)  scheme  to  promote  the  capital  investment  in  the 
distribution sector by providing interest subsidy, linked with reform measures, on the loans taken by public and private 
power utilities for various capital works under distribution projects. This scheme shall be applicable in the entire country 
and all distribution projects shall be considered. The works covered under RGGVY & R-APDRP projects shall not be 
eligible so as to ensure non-duplication and non-overlapping of grant/subsidy towards investment.  
 
1.3.10  Energy Efficiency 
 
Government of India has undertaken a two pronged approach to cater to the energy demand of its citizens while ensuring 
minimum  growth  in  CO2  emissions,  so  that  the  global  emissions  do  not  lead  to  an  irreversible  damage  to  the  earth

system. On one hand, the Government is promoting greater use of renewables in the energy mix mainly through solar 
and wind and at the same time shifting towards supercritical technologies for coal based power plants. On the other 
hand, efforts are being made to efficiently use the energy in the demand side through various innovative policy measures 
under the overall ambit of Energy Conservation Act, 2001. 
 
 
Ministry of Power, through Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), has initiated a number of energy efficiency initiatives 
in  the  areas  of  household  lighting,  commercial  buildings,  standards  and  labelling  of  appliances,  demand  side 
management  in  agriculture/municipalities,  SME's  and  large  industries  including  the  initiation  of  the  process  for 
development  of  energy  consumption  norms  for  industrial  sub  sectors,  capacity  building  of  State  Designated 
Agency (SDA), etc. These initiatives have resulted in an avoided capacity generation of 36,323 MW during the period 
2006-2014. 
 
1.3.11 
 The National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency  
 
The National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) is one of the eight missions under the National Action 
Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). NMEEE aims to strengthen the market for energy efficiency by creating conducive 
regulatory  and  policy  regime  and  has  envisaged  fostering  innovative  and  sustainable  business  models  to  the  energy 
efficiency sector.  
The NMEEE spelt out four initiatives to enhance energy efficiency in energy intensive industries which are as follows:  
1)  Perform, Achieve and Trade Scheme (PAT), a regulatory instrument to reduce specific energy consumption in 
energy  intensive  industries,  with  an  associated  market  based  mechanism  to  enhance  the  cost  effectiveness 
through certification of excess energy saving which can be traded. 
2)  Market Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE), for accelerating the shift to energy efficient appliances 
in designated sectors through innovative measures to make the products more affordable.  
3)  Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP), for creation of mechanisms that would help finance Demand 
Side Management(DSM) programmes in all sectors by capturing future energy savings. 
4)  Framework for Energy Efficient Economic Development (FEEED), for development of fiscal instruments to 
promote energy efficiency.  
The Mission seeks to upscale the efforts to unlock the market for energy efficiency which is estimated to be around ₹ 
74,000 crores and help achieve total avoided capacity addition of 19,598 MW, fuel savings of around 23 million tonnes 
per year and greenhouse gas  emission reductions of 98.55 million tonnes per  year at  its  full implementation stage. 
Continuation of NMEEE was approved by Cabinet on 6th August, 2014 with a total outlay of ₹ 775 crores. 
 
1.3.12  Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme 
 
Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme (DELP) was launched by Government of India, replacing the Bachat Lamp 
Yojana  (BLY).  The  scheme  provides  LED  bulbs  at  a  subsidized  rate  for  replacing  incandescent  lamps  or  Compact 
Fluorescent Lamps(CFL) to households. More than 9 crore LED bulbs were distributed in 2015-16 registering a 150 
times growth against 6 lakhs in 2013-14. Procurement price of LED bulbs reduced from ₹310 for a 7 W bulb in January 
2014 to ₹ 38.00 for a 9 W bulb in the last bidding carried out in 2016.  As on 20.09.2017 26,37,24,970 LED bulbs have 
been distributed.  
 
 
1.3.13 Human Resource Development – Adopt an ITI Scheme 
 
Power  industry  is  highly  capital  intensive  industry  where  human  element  is  the  most  vital  input.  The  power  sector 
provides wide range of opportunities across different levels of skill and aptitude. Power industry requires technically 
trained manpower for various roles such as project planning, implementation, erection, commissioning, testing, O&M 
for  generation  transmission  and  distribution  of  power,  which  includes  renewable  energy  sector  and  manufacturing 
segment.  Due  to  the  technology  intensive  nature  of  the  business,  technical  and  managerial  competency  is  crucial  in 
ensuring timely implementation of projects and optimum performance upon commissioning. 
 
The  labour  intensity  of  energy  production,  i.e.  the  labour  required  per  unit  of  energy  produced,  is  much  higher  in 
renewable energy sources than in conventional energy production primarily due to the distributed nature of the projects. 
These distributed renewable sources of power not only provide clean, green and sustainable form of energy but also

have enormous potential to generate employment in the rural communities. Small hydro, solar and biomass based energy 
can go a long way in powering rural communities. Government of India has set a target for renewable capacity of 175 
GW by 2022, it is important to ensure that the manpower be trained and equipped in these emerging areas. 
 
 
Driven by the imperative to mitigate climate change, there is an increasing focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency, 
conservation measures so as to reduce carbon footprint from the power sector. This inter-alia, includes implementation 
of energy efficient systems, monitoring & auditing. Other key focus areas include loss reduction in distribution utilities 
and improving Demand Side Management (DSM). Monitoring systems for detecting losses as well as DSM techniques 
require usage of advanced IT and communication systems which call for a large number of personnel to be trained in 
these specialised areas.  
 
With the emergence of competitive markets and power trading systems, a large number of highly skilled professionals 
with commercial and technical knowledge are required in this area. Other key decision makers and managers also need 
to develop a good understanding of the trading systems in order to make commercial decisions. 
 
With the increase in the stakeholders in the industry, the role of regulators is also very important. Training of regulators 
at regular intervals is an important issue that would promote institutional capability and provide the regulators with the 
necessary skill sets.  Apart from the regulators, the respective State Governments should also initiate steps to provide 
training  to  the  staff  of  regulatory  commissions  since  it  has  been  observed  that  the  in-house  capacity  of  most  of  the

The site at Cheyyur in Kanchipuram district in Tamil Nadu 
has  been  identified  at  Panaiyur  village.  (RFQ)  and  (RFP) 
were issued in 2013 as per revised  
Standard  Bidding  Documents  (SBD)  for  UMPPs.  The 
bidders had withdrawn from the bidding process due to the 
reason  that  the  revised  SBD  does  not  fully  address  their 
concern. The main areas of concern were DBFOT structure, 
coal cost not being fully passed through, stricter norms than 
CERC/CEA and grid code, onerous termination clauses and 
intrusive role of independent Engineer. Accordingly, MoP 
vide letter dated 29.12.2014 terminated the bidding process. 
Fresh  RFQ  and  RFP  are  to  be  issued  after  approval  of 
revised Standard Bidding Document by Govt.of India.

2.1     12TH PLAN CAPACITY ADDITION TARGET FROM CONVENTIONAL SOURCES 
 
One of the major objectives of the National Electricity Policy,2005 is to fully meet the electricity demand by the year 
2012, thus mitigating all peaking and energy shortages. Now this objective is aimed to be achieved by  the year 2017. 
Accordingly, a capacity addition target for the 12th Plan was finalised at 88,537 MW. Details of sector wise and mode 
wise capacity addition target is given in Table 2.1 and subsequently in Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2.

2.2 CAPACITY ADDITION FROM CONVENTIONAL SOURCES DURING 12TH PLAN 
 
The target set for capacity addition during the 12th Plan was 88,537 MW from conventional sources. As on 31st March, 
2017, capacity of 99,209.5 MW has been added during 12th five Year Plan comprising of 5,479 MW of Hydro, 91,730.5 
MW of Thermal and 2,000 MW of Nuclear. 
 
Out of planned capacity addition target of 88,537 MW to be achieved by the end of 12th plan, a capacity addition of 
63,912.9 MW has been achieved as per target and projects totalling to 24,614 MW have slipped from 12th Plan target 
on account of various reasons viz. delay in placement of order for main plant, slow progress of civil works, poor geology 
etc. Further, additional projects totalling to 35,296.6 MW which were at various stages of construction and originally 
not included in the 12th Plan capacity addition target have also been commissioned during 12th Plan period. A summary 
of the total capacity addition during 12th Plan is given in Table 2.2.

2.3 ADDITIONAL CAPACITY ADDITION ACHIEVED DURING 12TH PLAN  
(NOT INCLUDED IN THE TARGETED CAPACITY OF 88,537 MW) 
 
As  per  Electricity  Act,2003,  thermal  generation  has  been  delicensed  which  encouraged  setting  up  of  thermal  power 
projects. As a result, a capacity of 35,296.6 MW not included in the 12th Plan target has yielded benefits during 12th 
Plan.  The  sector  wise  and  mode  wise  details  are  shown  in  Table  2.5  and  Exhibit  2.6.  This  includes  private  sector 
contribution of 22,399.5 MW, amounting to around 63.5% of the total capacity addition which is outside the target.

Majority of additional projects commissioned during 12th Plan were listed in the previous National Electricity Plan. 
However, projects to the tune of 88,537 MW were identified based on the assessment of their likely commissioning 
during 12th Plan period.  
 
2.4 A COMPARISON OF 12TH PLAN WITH PREVIOUS FIVE YEAR PLANS 
 
The capacity addition target vs achievement during the previous few five year Plans is given in Table 2.6. 
 
 As can be seen  from  Table  2.6, capacity addition achievement  for previous five  year Plans  was  short of the  target 
whereas during 12th Plan, the capacity addition achieved is 112% of the target.

addition from Hydro and Nuclear has not been able to keep pace with that of thermal capacity addition. 
 
2.5 COAL BASED THERMAL CAPACITY ADDITION 
 
 
To follow low carbon growth strategy, Government of India is promoting supercritical technology for coal based power 
plants,  which  has  higher  efficiency  than  conventional  sub  critical  technology,  thereby  ensuring  less  CO2 emissions.  
Table 2.7 shows that around 35,230 MW (42%) of the total capacity addition from coal units (84,850 MW) are based 
on supercritical technology (660MW and above) during the 12th Plan period.  It is observed that 36 no. of coal based 
units on supercritical technology have been commissioned in private sector out of the total of 51 no of supercritical 
technology based units commissioned during 12th Plan.

• 
Problems in acquisition of land for construction of power plant, ash dyke, raw water  reservoir, corridor for 
pipelines,  Railway  siding  etc.  and  Right  of  Way  /Right  of  Use  for  raw  water  pipe  line,  ash  slurry  disposal 
pipelines and transmission lines etc. 
•  Local agitations including aspects such as R&R issues, labor disputes and law and order problems.  Further, 
ethnic violence in some specific regions has also resulted in long interruptions at work site. 
•  Delay in timely availability of railway transport system and healthiness/load carrying capacity of road transport 
system for smooth transportation of equipment and fuel to the plant site. 
•  Change in State policies viz. in respect of sand mining, extraction of ground water etc. during plant construction 
period. 
Issues in timely availability of startup power at site. 
Issues in timely completion of power evacuation system and capacity of transmission system to evacuate full 
power generated at the plant. 
Shortage of Natural Gas 
• 
• 
• 
•  Cost overruns on account of delay in timely completion of power projects  
• 
Issues  in  availability  of  adequate  finances  from  banks  and  financial  institutions  for  completion  of  projects 
leading to cost overruns/increased cost of the plant. 
Poor performance of main contractor and sub-vendors including BoP sub-vendors for various reasons/issues 
involved. 
• 
•  Contractual disputes resulting in termination of contract and re-tendering etc. resulting in project delays and 
cost overrun. 
•  Natural calamities and extreme weather conditions including heavy rains, cyclones etc., specifically in coastal 
areas. 
•  Non signing of long term PPA with DISCOMs and non-fulfillment of PPA conditions by the project developers.  
In some cases, even no PPA is available for sale of power from the power plant. 
•  Delay in availability of Consent to Establish, Consent to Operate (CTO) from respective State Governments. 
 
2.8 RENOVATION & MODERNIZATION PROGRAMME 
 
R & M has been recognized as one of the cost effective options for obtaining the additional generation and better outputs 
from the existing old power units. R&M of such units is very essential for bringing in improvement in the performance 
of the units as well as for system upgradation to comply with the stricter environmental conditions or stipulations in case 
of thermal units. However, the Life Extension (LE) of the old power units is carried out with an aim to  extend their 
useful life from 15 to 20 years beyond the original designed economical life. 
 
2.8.1 Thermal  
 
LE/R&M works which were to be taken up during 12th Plan are given in Table 2.9.   R&M/LE works in respect of 37 
nos.  thermal  units  with  aggregate  capacity  of  7,202.26  MW  have  been  completed  during  12th  Plan.  Details  of  the 
achievement of R&M and LE projects completed during 12th Plan are shown in Table 2.10.

2.9 CAPTIVE POWER PLANTS 
 
Large number of captive plants including co-generation power plants of  varied types and sizes exist in the country, 
which are utilized in process industry and in-house power consumption. Number of industries set up their captive plants 
to  ensure  reliable  and  quality  power.    Some  plants  are  also  installed  as  stand-by  units  for  operation  only  during 
emergencies when the grid supply is not available. Surplus power, if any, from captive power plants could be fed into 
the grid as the Electricity Act, 2003 provides for non-discriminatory open access.

 
As  envisaged  in  Electricity  Act,  2003,  private  players  have  started  playing  dominant  role  in  capacity 
addition in power sector, with 55 % of total capacity addition from conventional sources during 12th Plan. 
 
There has been considerable slippage in the Hydro and Nuclear capacity addition envisaged in the 12th Plan.   
The factors affecting capacity addition in Hydro and Nuclear sectors need to be addressed urgently to arrest 
the further decline in the generation mix. 
 
 
 
 
Capacity addition from supercritical technology based coal power plants have contributed around 42% of 
the total capacity addition from coal based plants commissioned during 12th Plan.

CHAPTER 3 
  
DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT, ENERGY EFFICIENCY & CONSERVATION 
 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND 
 
 
Demand-Side Management (DSM) is applied to energy efficiency measures that  would modify or reduce end-user’s 
energy demand. It is basically the selection, planning, and implementation of measures intended to have an influence on 
the demand either caused directly or indirectly by the utility’s programs. DSM has been traditionally considered as a 
means of reducing peak electricity demand. In the short term, DSM program facilitates reduction in energy cost as well 
as the need for adding new distribution networks, thereby enhancing reliability for utilities and in the long term, can 
help  to  limit  the  need  for  utilities  to  build  new  power  plants,  and  transmission  lines.  As  a  customer  strategy,  DSM 
programs encourage the installation and use of end-use technologies that consume less energy, thereby reducing the 
customers’ overall electric bill. Energy Efficient technologies also have higher efficiency operating characteristics, they 
tend  to  last  longer  and  thus  reducing  the  operation  and  maintenance  cost.  This  is  especially  true  for  programs  that 
encourage the use of high efficiency heating, cooling, and ventilation equipment (HVAC), energy efficient lighting, fans 
and  motors.  For  some  utilities,  DSM  programs  can  help  them  reduce  their  peak/costly  power  purchases  from  the 
wholesale  market  thereby  lowering  their  overall  cost  of  operations.  Reduced  or  shifted  energy  usage  can  directly 
translate  into  less  air  pollution,  less  carbon  emissions,  and  thereby  reducing  the  potential  environmental  threats 
associated with global warming. 
 
3.1 ENERGY CONSERVATION ACT AND FORMATION OF BUREAU OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY 
 
Considering vast energy saving potential and in order to bring a movement in energy conservation and energy efficiency 
in  different  end-uses  in  the  country,  the  Government  of  India  enacted  the  Energy  Conservation  (EC)Act,  2001  for 
providing sustainable and more efficient management of our energy resources. The Act came into force in March, 2002. 
The broad objectives of E C Act, 2001 are: 
 
a)  Promote faster adoption of energy efficiency and conservation through regulation, participation and cost-effective 
measures 
Involve States and other stakeholders in the energy efficiency initiatives 
b) 
 
c)  Create a sustainable environment for demand of energy efficient products, technologies and professionals 
It is universally acknowledged that the business case for Energy Efficiency is compelling, good return on investment, 
reduction  of  input  cost,  delinking  economic  growth  and  energy  dependency.  It  also  yields  significant  co-benefits, 
which  include  economic  growth  and  job  creation.  Despite  such  apparently  straightforward  advantages,  the  rate  of 
adoption of Energy Efficiency (EE) historically lagged behind the opportunities. To address the adoption bottleneck 
through  regulatory  and  promotional  activities,  Bureau  of  Energy  Efficiency  (BEE)  was  created  in  2002  with  the 
mission to “assist in developing policies and strategies with a thrust on self-regulation and market principles, within 
the  overall  framework  of  the  E  C  Act,  2001  with  the primary  objective  of  reducing  energy  intensity  of  the  Indian 
economy”.  
 
3.2. ASSESSMENT OF ENERGY EFFICENCY MEASURES AND ACHIEVEMENTS TILL 12TH PLAN.  
 
India’s energy intensity in 2001 was 0.175 kgoe/₹ (kg of oil equivalent/₹) and it came down to 0.0131 kgoe/₹ in 2013. 
This is equivalent to a saving of about 258 mtoe (Million tonnes of oil equivalent) of Total Primary Energy Supply 
(TPES) during this period based on a year-to-year basis estimation. The year-to-year energy saving (in TPES term) has 
seen an increasing trend during 2001 to 2013 which have been mainly due to couple of factors i.e.  
 
  Structural shift in economic activities, product & energy mix etc. 
 Energy Efficiency initiatives  
 In 2010, BEE under the aegis of Ministry of Power, was also entrusted with the task of implementing the National 
Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE).  The various Energy Efficiency initiatives taken by BEE under the 
four major intervention areas are given in Table 3.1.

The cumulative energy consumption of the country was 7715 mtoe during 2001-2013 at the user-ends. It is estimated 
that 215mtoe (i.e. 2.8% of the total consumption) energy was saved due to energy efficiency measures from the year 
2001 to 2013. Out of this, about 23% savings is due to direct result of BEE’s interventions. The overall energy saving 
due to BEE’s schemes/programs is about 49.1mtoe during 2001-2013. As per BEE calculations, an avoided capacity of 
36,323MW  during  the  years  2006  to  2014  has  been  achieved.  The  National  Energy  Conservation  Award  (NECA) 
scheme which was launched by Ministry of Power in 1999 has also resulted energy savings in participating industries.  
 
The total energy consumption and energy savings due to energy efficiency measures are shown in Exhibit 3.1.

EE Savings (mtoe)

It is quite evident from the Exhibit 3.1 that the saving realization due to BEE schemes has been appreciable after 2007 
when many schemes were operationalized. In terms of avoided capacity, BEE has always exceeded the yearly targets 
assigned to it by Central Government. Although the scheme wise targeted saving has not been achieved by all schemes, 
the overall saving has been remarkable. It is found that BEE schemes have the maximum direct impact on residential 
sector as 77% of the savings are result of Standards & Labelling program which mainly covers household appliances. 
However,  BEE  efforts  have  led  to  much  bigger  impact  on  account  of  customers  taking  voluntary  initiatives  due  to 
increased awareness.  
 
3.2.1 Achievements of demand reduction by Energy Efficiency measure 
It is observed that the benefits reported by BEE, have been mainly concentrated in one or two schemes i.e. appliance 
and industry programs (as shown in Table 3.2). Therefore, there is lot of scope in other schemes and larger penetration 
opportunities of energy efficiency in different stages and types of end users.

(iv) Technical assistance and capacity building 
(v)  SMEs Product Labelling Promotion Scheme 
 
3.5.2.4 Capacity Building of DISCOMs 
 
Bureau of Energy Efficiency has launched a programme for capacity building of DISCOMs. This programme will help 
in integration of EE activities with  the activities managed by Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) for Demand Side 
Management.  Further,  this  programme  will  help  in  capacity  building  of  DISCOMs  and  development  of  various 
mechanisms to promote  DSM in  their respective States. 34  nos. DISCOMs  have been  selected to participate  in  this 
programme. The following activities would be carried out by BEE and DISCOMs under this programme. 
 
(i)  Establishment of DSM Cell by selected DISCOMs. 
(ii)  Creation of about 500 Master Trainers from officials of DISCOMs under Training of Trainers (ToT). 
(iii)  Training of 4000-5000 circle level officials of DISCOMs under Capacity building workshops. 
(iv)  Providing Manpower Support to DISCOMs for facilitating DISCOMs for implementation of DSM measures 
in their areas.

3.5.2.5 Installation of Solar Water Heating Systems (SWHS) 
 
 Solar water Heating is now a mature technology. Wide spread utilization of solar water heaters can reduce consumption 
of conventional energy being used for heating water in homes, industries and commercial & institutional establishments. 
Solar water heaters of 100-300 litres capacity are suited for domestic applications and larger capacity heating systems 
can be used for restaurants, guest-houses, hotels, hospitals, industries etc. A solar heating system of 2m2 area can replace 
electric geyser of 2 kW load. MNRE has informed the projections of installation of SWHS having total area of 800,000 
m2 /year in the country during 2016-17 to 2020-21. These SWHS would have the potential to reduce the annual peak 
load of the country by 800 MW.  
 
3.5.3  Institutional Mechanism: Strengthening of State Designated Agencies (SDA) 
 
It is well recognized that State Designated Agencies (SDAs) in different States need to play a very important role 
in terms of carrying forward various energy efficiency initiatives at the State level. The thrust of the SDA program 
is based on strengthening the 35 SDAs which would enable them to implement various EE and EC programs and 
activities initiated by BEE or SDAs themselves. 
 
The activities include sector specific interventions in areas like municipality (drinking water and sewage treatment), 
agriculture sector (pumping), street lighting, commercial buildings, Government buildings and waste heat recovery 
in SMEs including demonstration projects. Following initiatives of SDAs are proposed to be supported that would 
help in strengthening the capacities of SDAs and undertaking of various projects and programmes to promote energy 
efficiency in their respective States: 
 
(i) 
(ii)  Continued engagement of SDAs with energy efficiency professionals like energy auditors, energy managers 
Support for implementing State-wise sector specific energy saving plan by the SDAs 
and ESCOs

3.5.4  Regulatory Instruments  
 
3.5.4.1  ToD (Time of Day) Metering / ToU (Time of Use) Pricing 
 
ToD/ToU metering is a billing method in which depending on the expected load on the grid, a billing day is divided into 
several time zones.  The duration of each time zone is programmable and the user can define the time zones as per his 
requirements.    The  meter  records  the  energy  consumed  in  different  time  zones  in  separate  registers  and  exhibits 
accordingly. Consumption in each of the time zone is charged at different rates. The tariff rates for different time zones 
are fixed in such a way that a consumer pays more for energy used during peak hours than for off‐peak hours. It becomes 
the responsibility of the consumer to either restrict his energy usage or pay accordingly. This encourages consumers to 
shift load during cheaper time periods of the day. TOD metering helps consumers to manage their consumption which 
in turn helps the utility in managing the peak demand.  
 
TOD  metering  helps  in  shifting  the  loads  mostly  to  off-  peak  hours,  resulting  in  reduction  in  the  peak  demand 
requirement of the utilities by flattening their load curve. It would also improve the financial health of the utilities as the 
utilities would not have to buy costly power during peak hours. 
 
Hence, TOD Metering system is very useful for utilizing the available electrical energy in an optimum way. This also 
helps  the  utilities  to  plan  their  distribution  infrastructure  appropriately.  This  can  be  implemented  in  all  consumer 
categories be it domestic, commercial, industrial or even BPL consumers. 
 
Presently, most of the States have implemented this type of metering for industrial and commercial consumers. However, 
it is very difficult to assess the reduction in Peak Demand achieved through the use of TOD metering unless specific 
inputs are received from the States in this regard. 
 
3.5.4.2  Demand Response (DR) 
 
Ability  to  reduce  electricity  demand  from  appliance  to  manage  peak  demand  would  reduce  the  need  for  costly 
investments in energy supply, manage shortages, and improve the reliability of the electricity grid. DR primarily takes 
the form of: (a) involuntary load shedding by utilities, and (b) time of use pricing. More nuanced equipment based auto 
DR can be used to avoid blanket load shedding in the short run and avoid investment in expensive peak plants in the 
long run. Demand Response (DR) can, therefore, be considered a valuable resource for managing the electricity grid. It 
can  effectively  mitigate  peak  demand  and  also  reduce  the  costs  associated  with  integrating  intermittent  renewable 
electricity generation. 
 
3.5.5 Reduction in AT&C losses: 
 
To address the issues related to the high AT&C losses and reforms in the distribution sector of the States, the Government 
of India launched Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme (APDRP) for 10th Plan and Restructured 
Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme (R-APDRP) for 11thPlan. In the 11th Plan, the scheme has 
been  restructured  with  emphasis  on  actual  demonstrable  performance  in  terms  of  sustained  loss  reduction.  The 
programme was of ₹ 51,577 crores. 
Ministry of Power has further sanctioned “Integrated Power Development Scheme” (IPDS) in December, 2014 with the 
following components:  
 
(i) 
(ii)  Metering of distribution transformer/feeders/consumers in the urban areas.  
Strengthening of sub-transmission and distribution networks in the urban areas.

(iii) 
IT enablement of distribution sector and strengthening of distribution network, for completion of the targets 
laid down under R-APDRP for 12th and 13th Plans by carrying forward the approved outlay for R-APDRP to 
IPDS.  
The components at (i) and (ii) above have an estimated outlay of ₹ 32,612 crores, including a budgetary support 
of ₹ 25,354 crores from Government of India during the entire implementation period. 
The scheme of R-APDRP as approved by Govt. for continuation in 12th and 13th Plans has been subsumed in 
this  scheme  as  a  separate  component  relating  to  IT  enablement  of  distribution  sector  and  strengthening  of 
distribution network [component (iii) above] for which Govt. has already approved the scheme cost of ₹ 44,011 
crores including a budgetary support of ₹ 22,727 crores. This outlay will be carried forward to the new scheme 
of IPDS in addition to the outlay indicated above. (Source: MoP order No. 26/1/2014-APDRP dated 03-12-
2014) 
Ministry of Power has also laid down a State-wise AT&C loss reduction trajectory till the year 2019-20 to be 
followed by various States across the country.  
 
 
3.5.6 Affordable Energy Efficient Lighting Solution 
 
(i)  The Lighting Industry has seen a strong growth of more than 67% from ₹ 8500 Crores in 2010 to ₹ 16200 Crores 
in 2014. This has been driven largely from Incandescent Lamps (GLS) to Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) 
and recently with Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) Several Government initiatives have supported this transition, 
including Government regulations and directives to use CFL in Government buildings, and large installations. 
Government being largest buyer of lighting products, impacts the industry business by various actions. Recent 
initiatives by Government to promote and procure LED Lighting products, has suddenly changed the scenario 
for which the lighting industry was not prepared.  
 
The chart below gives a fair idea of total population of Light points in domestic sector, Street Light population 
in year 2005, possible growth by 2020 and likely business available that needs to be tapped in India. 
Table 3.6 
*Street Light sale between 2015-2020 will be around 41 million 
 
 
(ii) 
Initiatives by Government to Promote LED Lighting in India 
 
Making BIS  standards  mandatory, establishment of Energy Efficiency  Services  Limited  (EESL),  making star 
labelling  for  LED  Lamps  by  BEE  and  later  for  LED  down  lights  and  launching  Demand  side  management 
schemes to promote LED lamps are the initiatives that the Government has taken to push use of LED Lighting 
in  all  segments.  Under  Electronic  System  Design  &  Manufacturing,  DeitY  has  initiated  several  schemes  to 
provide relief and funding for land, equipment and tax holiday etc., to promote electronic manufacturing in India 
including LED Lighting.

3.6 ACHIEVEMENTS AND PLANS WITH RESPECT TO MISSIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
The National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) is one of the eight missions under the National Action 
Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). NMEEE aims to strengthen the market for energy efficiency by creating conducive 
regulatory and policy regime and has envisaged fostering innovative and sustainable business models for the energy 
efficiency sector.  
 
 
The NMEEE spelt out four initiatives to enhance energy efficiency in energy intensive industries which are as follows:  
  Perform,  Achieve  and  Trade  Scheme  (PAT),  a  regulatory  instrument  to  reduce  specific  energy  consumption  in 
energy intensive industries, with an associated market based mechanism to enhance the cost effectiveness through 
certification of excess energy saving which can be traded. 
  Market Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE), for accelerating the shift to energy efficient appliances in 
designated sectors through innovative measures to make the products more affordable.  
  Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP), for creation of mechanisms that would help finance demand side 
management programmes in all sectors by capturing future energy savings. 
  Framework  for  Energy  Efficient  Economic  Development  (FEEED),  for  development  of  fiscal  instruments  to 
promote energy efficiency.  
 
The Mission seeks to upscale the efforts to unlock the market for energy efficiency which is estimated to be around ₹ 
74,000 crore and help achieve total avoided capacity addition of 19,598 MW, fuel savings of around 23 million tonnes 
per year and greenhouse gas emissions reductions of 98.55 million tonnes per year at its full implementation stage.  
Continuation of NMEEE was approved by Cabinet on 6th August, 2014 with a total outlay of ₹ 775 crores. 
 
3.6.1 Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) 
 
On 30th March, 2012 energy saving targets for 478 designated consumers belonging to 8 sectors were notified. In the 
first  cycle  of  PAT  (ending  in  year  2014-15),  478  industrial  units  in  8  sectors  (Aluminium,  Cement,  Chlor-  Alkali, 
Fertilizer, Iron & Steel, Paper & Pulp, Thermal Power, Textile) have been mandated to reduce their specific energy 
consumption (SEC) i.e. energy used per unit of production by March,2015. Overall, the SEC reduction targets aim to 
secure 4.05% reduction in the SEC in these industries totalling an energy saving of 6.686 million tonne of oil equivalent 
which would account for mitigation of about 24 million tons of CO2.  
 
Sector Specific proforma along with Sector Specific Normalization Factors to streamline the monitoring and verification 
(M&V) process has been prepared. The sector/ sub-sector specific Normalization Factors were developed to neutralize 
the  effects  on  specific  energy  consumption  (SEC)  in  the  assessment  year  as  well  as  baseline  year  so  that  undue 
advantages or disadvantages could not be imposed on any Discoms while assessing the targets. To facilitate the M&V 
process, M&V guidelines for all the 8 sectors have been developed. BEE has put in place a process of accreditation of 
Energy Auditors who will be engaged to execute the M&V process of DCs to assess their performances. Development 
of  Energy  Saving  Certificates  (EScerts)  trading  infrastructure  is  in  process  in  collaboration  with  Central  Electricity 
Regulatory Commission (CERC). 
 
Documents  on  “Pro-forma  and  Normalization  Equation”  and  “Normalization  Document  and  Monitoring  and 
Verification Guidelines” have been prepared to facilitate the effective implementation of the scheme and copies of same 
have been provided to all Designated Consumers, Accredited Energy Auditors and State Designated Agencies. 
  
The  Draft  Rules/Regulations  for  trading  of  energy  savings  certificate  has  been  finalized  and  submitted  for  getting 
concurrence of CERC for finalization and Notification. For Development of Repository of trading platform, POSOCO 
has been identified as repository of ESCerts Trading. PATNET, an online platform for data reporting, trading of ESCerts, 
etc. is operational.  
 
PAT “Deepening” process has already been initiated to include more DCs while keeping the same threshold and in some 
sectors such as Iron and  Steel and Pulp and Paper by reducing the  threshold so that  more and  more industrial  units 
participate in the energy enhancement scheme. Similarly, “Widening” of the PAT i.e. inclusion of more sector in the 
DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT

PAT fold has also been initiated. Presently, refinery, Electricity DISCOMs, and Railways are under consideration for 
including  in  the  PAT  cycle  II.  PAT  is  visualized  as  a  multi-cycle  scheme  aimed  towards  raising  the  efficiency  of 
economy to a higher level.   
 
PAT cycle I was completed on 31stMarch, 2015. From 1st April, 2015 to 14thAugust, 2015 was the M&V phase.  The 
verification of the performance of DCs was carried out by Accredited Energy Auditing Firms. Currently scrutiny of 
performance assessment documents (PADs) is under process by State Designated Agencies (SDAs) and by Bureau of 
Energy Efficiency (BEE). After the scrutiny by BEE and on the recommendation of BEE, the Central Government will 
issue ESCerts which can be traded at Power Exchanges. 
 
 
When compared to the baseline energy consumption at the beginning of PAT scheme, the energy efficiency measures 
have resulted in a savings of around 6% till 2010.

In next three years (2016-17,2017-18 and 2018-19), the industrial energy savings are targeted to reach  10% through 
widening of PAT scheme to new sectors as well as increasing the penetration within the current sectors. In addition, 
guidelines  for  mandatory  disclosures  on  energy  consumption  by  companies,  under  the  Companies  Act  will  help  in 
achieving the 10% targets. 
 
As per Guidelines on Energy and Energy Conservation Reporting in Annual Reports of companies, all firms, registered 
under the Companies Act, are mandated to disclose their annual energy consumption and energy conservation initiatives 
through the company’s annual report. With the appropriate guidelines in place, the scope and nature of data provided, 
including energy and energy conservation data, will be more streamlined and robust. This will also encourage companies 
to  undertake  energy  audits,  identify  energy  intensive  areas  within  the  firm  as  well  as  formulate  energy  efficiency 
measures to improve energy savings. 
 
Outreach  activities  to  consult  with  designated  consumers  and  technology  providers  including  knowledge  exchange 
platform to share experiences within and between sectors.  
 
3.6.2 Market Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE) 
 
Under MTEE, two programmes have been developed i.e. Bachat Lamp Yojana (BLY) and Super-Efficient Equipment 
Programme (SEEP). 
 
i) Bachat Lamp Yojana (BLY): It is a public-private partnership program comprising of BEE, Distribution Companies 
(DISCOMs) and private investors to accelerate market transformation in energy efficient lighting.  Under this program, 
over 29 million incandescent bulbs have been replaced by CFLs  
In the next phase of BLY, BEE will promote use of LED lights using the institutional structure of BLY Programme. 
BEE provides support to Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) for framing technical specification and monitoring 
and verification of the energy savings from the LED bulbs distributed under RGVVY scheme to BPL households. BEE 
will also undertake outreach activities to promote large scale adoption of LEDs. 
 
(ii) Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme (DELP): Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) has evolved a 
service model where it works with electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs) through a benefit sharing approach. 
DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
3.12 
                       Central Electricity Authority                                                                                                                                National Electricity Plan  
 
 
 
The Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme (DELP) obviates the need for DISCOMs to invest in the upfront cost of 
LED bulbs; EESL procures the LEDs bulbs and provides to consumers at a rate of ₹ 10 each as against their market 
price of ₹ 350-600.  
 
 
A)  DELP scheme -Key features: 
DELP will leverage the Demand Side Management (DSM) regulatory framework that SERCs have created to 
set up a robust payment security mechanism. EESL, on its own or in collaboration with partners, will undertake 
project implementation and take the investment risk. The methodology has been uniquely developed with strong 
focus on the monitoring and verification aspects. Following are some of the key features of DELP. 
 
• Distribution of LEDs to households at cost of ₹ 10 as against a market price of ₹ 350 to 600  
• At least three years’ free replacement warrantee 
• No impact on tariff 
• Payment to EESL from DISCOM spread over 5 years from energy savings achieved 
• Benefits sharing approach 
The upfront investment made by EESL is paid back in two different ways as indicated under as case 
studies:

B)  Service Model–Street Light 
EESL has been designated as the implementing agency for Street Light programmes.  EESL has evolved 
a service model to enable Municipalities to replace conventional lights with LEDs at no upfront cost. The 
balance cost is recovered through the municipalities by monetising the energy savings. 
 
Case Study 2-Vizag Street Light Project 
 
EESL  has  implemented  about  92,000  street  light  retrofit  projects  in  Vizag.  This  project  will  reduce  the  energy 
consumption by 50%. The entire upfront capital of ₹ 64 crores has been invested by EESL and will be recovered 
over a 7 years’ period. The municipality will pay EESL a sum of ₹ 18.5 crore every year whereas its overall costs 
savings would be ₹ 31 crores annually. This service model is replicable as it obviates the need for upfront capital as 
well as reduces the recurring expenditure of municipalities. This model could help scale up energy efficient street 
light replacement in the country. A brief on Vizag efficient street light project is as follows:

LED deployment: 4.5 million LED lights to domestic consumers and 90,000 LED street lights have been deployed 
by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) with an estimated saving of about 274 million units of electricity.   
(iii)  Super-Efficient Equipment Programme (SEEP): The other component under MTEE is a new programme 
called  Super-Efficient  Equipment  Programme  (SEEP).  SEEP  is  a  program  designed  to  bring  accelerated  market 
transformation  for  super-efficient  appliances  by  providing  financial  stimulus  innovatively  at  critical  point/s  of 
intervention.    Under  this  program,  ceiling  fan  has  been  identified  as  the  first  appliance  to  be  adopted.  SEEP  for 
ceiling fans aims to leapfrog to an efficiency level which will be about 50% more efficient than market average by 
providing a time bound incentive to fan manufacturers to manufacture super-efficient (SE) fans and sell the same at 
a discounted price.  The goal is to support the introduction and deployment of super-efficient 35W ceiling fans, as 
against the current average ceiling fan sold in Indian market with about 70W rating. For the 12th Plan, it is targeted 
for deployment of 2 million fans during the Plan period with an outlay of ₹ 100 crores. Under this program, maximum 
of  ₹  500  per  fan  incentive  will  be  given  to  fan  manufactures  for  manufacture  and  sale  of  fans  meeting  SEEP 
specifications.  
 
Consultations  with  main  stakeholders  of  the  program  such  as  fan  manufactures  technology  providers,  R&D 
institutions, academia and civil society organizations have been completed. Main technical specifications have been 
finalized. Assessment of testing capacity and development of testing protocols have been completed. Independent 
agency for monitoring and verification has already been engaged. A panel of 5 Super-Efficient fan manufacturers 
has been selected through an open competitive bidding process.  
3.6.3 Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP) 
Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP) is one of the initiatives under NMEEE to provide a platform to interact 
with financial institutions and project developers for implementation of energy efficiency projects. Under EEFP, MoUs 
have  been  signed  with  financial  institutions  to  work  together  for  the  development  of  energy  efficiency  market  and 
capacity  building  of  FIs.  In  May  2015,  BEE  has  signed  a  MoU  with  Indian  Banks’  Association  regarding  Training 
Programme for scheduled commercial banks (except cooperative banks) on Energy Efficiency Financing. This Training 
Programme has been launched on 1st June 2015 in Mumbai, and two training of trainers workshops have been conducted 
so far. Under EEFP, BEE has also released the booklet on “Success stories of Energy Efficiency Projects Financed in 
India” and “Training Manual on energy efficiency financing” 
 
3.6.4 Framework of Energy Efficiency Economic Development (FEEED): 
Framework for Energy Efficient Economic Development (FEEED) is targeted to provide appropriate fiscal instruments 
that may supplement the efforts of the Government for creation of energy efficiency market. Under FEEED, BEE has 
constituted two funds namely Partial Risk Guarantee Fund for Energy Efficiency (PRGFEE) and Venture Capital Fund 
for Energy Efficiency (VCFEE). PRGFEE is a risk sharing mechanism to provide financial institutions (banks/NBFCs) 
with a partial coverage of risk involved in extending loans for energy efficiency projects. Under PRGFEE, the support 
has  been  provided  to  Government  buildings,  private  buildings  (commercial  or  multi-story  residential  buildings), 
municipalities, SMEs and industries. The guarantee will not exceed ₹ 3 crores (has been proposed to increase to ₹ 15 
crores)  per  project  or  50%  of  loan  amount,  whichever  is  less.  BEE  has  constituted  the  Supervisory  Committee  for 
PRGFEE and selected the consortium of RECPDCL-REC-EESL as the Implementing Agency for PRGFEE, which is 
in process of operationalizing the fund.  The notification of PRGFEE rules is also under process.  
DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT

VCFEE is a  fund to provide equity capital for energy efficiency projects. A single investment by the fund shall  not 
exceed ₹ 2 crores. The Fund shall provide last mile equity support to specific energy efficiency projects, limited to a 
maximum of 15% of total equity required, through Special Purpose Vehicles or ₹ 2 crores, whichever is less. The support 
has been provided to only Government buildings, private buildings (commercial or multi-storied residential buildings) 
and municipalities.  
 
 
3.6.5 Other initiatives of Government for enhancing energy efficiency in Generation sector 
 
i)  Adoption of super-critical technology in thermal generation 
 
Supercritical  units  are  designed  with  higher  steam  parameters  of  247kg/cm2,  565/593  °C.  With  the  higher  steam 
parameters  of  supercritical  units,  the  efficiency  of  these  supercritical  units  would  be  about  2-3%  higher  than  the 
efficiency of present 500 MW sub-critical units.  This would lead to corresponding savings in coal consumption and 
reduction in GHG emissions.  The thermal units in the country so far have largest size unit capacity of 800 MW.  60 
Nos. supercritical units of sizes 660/800 MW with a total capacity of 41,310 MW have been commissioned.  In the 
period 2017-22, coal based capacity addition was mainly through supercritical units.   
 
Coal fired thermal generation units based on Ultra-super-critical technology having  steam pressure of 257-300 kg/cm2 
and temperature of 600/610°C are also being introduced in the country.  
 
The national average thermal efficiency of coal/lignite based power plants has increased from 32.53% in 2009-10 to 
about 34% in 2013-14.  It is expected that the efficiency of coal based generation would further improve in the period 
2017-22 due to commissioning of large size super critical units 
 
ii) Automatic transfer of LOA/Coal Linkage in case of Scrapping old thermal units 
 
Min. of Coal, Government of India has formulated a policy on automatic transfer of LOA/coal linkage (granted to old 
plants) to new plants in case of scrapping of old units and replacing them with new higher efficiency super-critical units. 
(Illustration: for setting up of new supercritical plant of 1000 MW capacity, at least 500 MW of old capacity has to go 
be retired. Old plants can be clubbed together to achieve this). The additional coal required shall be accorded priority in 
allocation subject to availability on best efforts basis from CIL.  
 
iii) Retirement of old & in-efficient thermal units 
 
The retirement of old and inefficient units of thermal generating stations and replacing them with new and more efficient 
units is one of the major initiatives taken by Government of India. The identified units are to be retired in a phased 
manner along with the matching capacity addition in the respective State, so as to have no impact of retirement on the 
power supply position in the States/country. A capacity of 2398 MW has been retired in 11th Plan period. In 12th Plan, 
capacity of 5,082 MW was retired.  
iv) Renovation and Modernization (R&M) & Life Extension (LE) of existing old power stations 
 
 With an objective of improving efficiency and availability of old units, R&M and LE works of total capacity of 16,146 
MW have been completed in 11th Plan period.  In 12th Plan R&M and LE works for total capacity 7,202.26 MW was 
completed. 
 
v) R&D for Advance Ultra Supercritical technology 
 
Under  the  National  Mission  for  development  of  clean  coal  technologies,  an  R&D  project  has  been  taken  up  to 
indigenously  develop  Advance  Ultra  Supercritical  (A-USC)  technology  with  steam  temperature  of  around  700  0C. 
Typically an A-USC power plant having steam parameters of 300 kg/cm2 pressure and 700°C steam temperature may 
have plant efficiencies of around 46% (HHV higher heat value basis).  
 
NTPC, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR) and BHEL have signed a MOU for development of the A-
USC  technology.  It  is  proposed  to  execute  an  800  MW  A-USC  indigenous  demonstration  plant  (with  main  steam 
pressure of around 300 kg/ cm2 and temperature of 700 0C) in a 7-year period from the date of financial sanction by the 
DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT

3.7 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
 
  Regulators  to  notify  their  DSM  regulations  and  direct  the  DISCOMs  to  prepare  their  DSM  action  Plans. 
Regulators  may  direct  Distribution  Companies  to  take  up  energy  efficiency  measures  in  their  areas.  The 
DISCOMs may be suitably incentivized to implement DSM projects like lighting, air-conditioning, agricultural 
pumps, refrigerators and ceiling fans etc. for reduction in their peak demand. 
 
  Encourage  implementation  of  ToD  Tariffs  for  industries  and  commercial  consumers  in  phased  manner  and 
include domestic consumers subsequently.  
 
  DISCOMs may be advised to carry out annual audits of energy flow of their distribution system. 
 
  Retirement of old and inefficient units and replacing them with more efficient supercritical units. 
 
 
Joint Committee may be constituted under chairmanship of Secretary (Power) with official from BEE, CEA, 
EESL, SERC, DISCOMs and other stakeholders to monitor and recommend improvements in DSM measure.

CHAPTER 4 
 DEMAND PROJECTIONS 
4.0 INTRODUCTION 
Demand  assessment  is  an  essential  prerequisite  for  planning  of  generation  capacity  addition  and  commensurate 
transmission  and  distribution  system  required  to  meet  the  future  electricity  requirement  of  various  sectors  of  the 
economy. The type and location of power plants is largely dependent on the magnitude, spatial distribution as well as 
the variation of electricity demand during the day, seasons and on yearly basis. Reliable planning of capacity addition 
for future is largely dependent on accurate assessment of future electricity demand.  
 
 
4.1 DEMAND ASSESSMENT BY CENTRAL ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY- ELECTRIC POWER SURVEY 
COMMITTEE 
 
Electricity demand of the country is periodically assessed by the Electric Power Survey Committee (EPSC), taking into 
account the actual electricity demand incident on the system in the past years, planned and under implementation policies 
and programmes of the Government, various developmental activities projected in future, impact of energy conservation 
measures, etc.  The last exercise to assess the demand was the 18th Electric Power Survey (EPS) and the report of 18th 
EPS was brought out in December, 2011. The 18th EPS Report covered year-wise electricity demand for States/ UTs, 
Regions and for the country till the year 2021-22 and perspective electricity demand for the years 2026-27 and 2031-
32. The 19th Electric Power Survey Committee (EPSC) was constituted by CEA in June, 2015. The terms of reference 
of the Committee were as under:  
 
i. 
To forecast the year- wise electricity demand for each State/ UT, Region and for the country for the 
years 2016-17 to 2026-27.   
 
ii. 
To project the perspective electricity demand for each State/ UT, Region and for the country the year 
2031-32 and 2036-37. 
The  Electric  Power  Survey  Committee  had  wide  representation  from  the  stake  holders  in  the  power  sector  with 
representatives from Niti Aayog, Ministry of Power, Bureau of Energy Efficiency, NTPC, NHPC, REC, BBMB, State 
Transmission Companies, State Distribution companies, Electricity Departments, TERI, FICCI, CII, NCAER, etc. The 
19th EPS report has been brought out in January,2017. 
 
4.2 METHODOLOGY ADOPTED  
 
Partial End Use Method (PEUM) has been adopted to project electricity demand for 19th EPS. Partial End Use Method 
is a “bottom-up” approach focusing on end-uses or final energy needs of different categories of consumers like domestic, 
commercial, irrigation, industries, railway traction, etc. Various initiatives of Government of India/State Governments 
like Power for All (PFA), DSM, energy conservation and efficiency improvement measures, Make in India, etc. have 
been broadly factored in the electricity demand projection.  
 
4.2.1 Data for Carrying Out Electricity Demand Projection 
 
For  carrying  out  electricity  demand  projection,  the  annual  electricity  data  covering  category-wise  consumption  of 
electrical  energy,  category-wise  connected  electric  load,  T&D  losses,  mid-year  population,  number  of  consumers, 
number of energized irrigation pump sets, aggregate capacity of irrigation pump sets, etc. from the year 2003-04 had 
been furnished by the Discoms/Utilities/ Electricity Departments of the States / UTs. Additional information such as 
programme of reduction in T&D losses, electrification of un-electrified households, irrigation pump sets energisation 
programme, details of lift irrigation schemes,  LT & HT public water works, bulk power supply etc. were also provided 
by the Discoms/Utilities/ Electricity Departments of the States / Union Territories. Some of the states indicated that the 
 DEMAND PROJECTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4.1 
                       Central Electricity Authority                                                                                                                                National Electricity Plan  
 
 
 
tariff structure for various categories of consumption adopted by their State(s) is different from categories included in 
the EPS and therefore they have clubbed these under the broad categories while furnishing information to CEA.  
 
State/UT  wise  annual  statements  of  power  supply  position  brought  out  by  CEA  indicating  actual  electrical  energy 
requirement and availability, peak electricity demand and peak met and the inter-regional and all-India diversity factors 
were also studied and considered for the demand projection. State/UT wise data of electricity demand for railway traction 
was provided by Ministry of Railways/Railway Board based on their programme of railway track electrification and 
expansion plans.  
 
 
Year-wise electricity demand projection has been carried out for the years 2016-17 to 2026-27 with the year 2015-16 
being taken as the base year. Perspective electricity demand projection has been done for the years 2031-32 and 2036-
37. The medium/long term projection of electricity demand has been done for 66 Discoms, 36 States/UT’s, 5 Regions 
and for the country. Since some distribution licensees (eg. KESCO, JUSCO etc.) did  not furnish the data separately, 
they have been considered as point load by the main Distribution Licensee.  
4.3 POLICY INITIATIVES OF GOVERNMENT AFFECTING ELECTRICITY DEMAND 
 
4.3.1 Reduction of AT&C losses 
Programmes for reduction of AT&C losses like Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY), IPDS, DDUGJY etc. are 
under implementation by the Government. The target is to reduce AT&C losses to about 13 % by the year 2021-22 on 
all-India basis. Reduction of AT&C losses would lead to reduction in electricity demand. The losses for Discoms have 
been taken as per the trajectory of loss reduction given by the respective Discoms. 
 
4.3.2 DSM, Energy Conservation & Efficiency improvement programs 
Ministry of Power, Government of India and the State Governments have introduced various programmes for vigorous 
Demand  Side  Management  (DSM),  improvement  of  energy  efficiency  and  energy  conservation  measures  like  S&L 
(Standards  &  Labelling),  Perform-Achieve-Trade  (PAT)  scheme  in  industries,  Energy  Efficient  Lighting  solutions, 
Super-Efficient  Equipment  Programme  etc.  There  would  be  reduction  in  electrical  energy  requirement  and  peak 
electricity demand through implementation of these programs. These initiatives have been factored in the electricity 
demand projection exercise.  
 
4.3.3 Power for All (PFA) Initiative 
Government of India had taken a joint initiative with respective State Governments/UT’s for preparation of State/UT 
specific  documents  for  providing  24X7  Power  to  all  households/homes,  industrial  and  commercial  consumers  and 
adequate supply of power to agricultural consumers as per their policy. This initiative aims at ensuring uninterrupted 
supply of quality power to existing consumers and providing access to electricity to all un-connected consumers by 2019 
in a phased manner. This initiative would result in higher growth of electrical energy requirement in the initial years of 
the forecast period. 
 
4.3.4 Dedicated Freight Corridor 
Electricity demand on account of dedicated freight corridor has been factored in the electricity demand of Railways as 
per  information  provided  by  Ministry  of  Railways/Railway  Board  based  on  their  programme  of  railway  track 
electrification and expansion plans.  
 
4.3.5 Make in India 
Make  in India is an initiative launched by the Government of India to encourage  multi-national, as  well as  national 
companies to manufacture their products in India. This initiative would lead to growth in electricity demand. The state 
utilities/Discoms were requested to include the electricity demand due to this programme in their demand projections.  
4.3.6 Electric Vehicles 
As per the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2012 of Department of Heavy Industries, Government of India, the 
 DEMAND PROJECTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4.2 
                       Central Electricity Authority                                                                                                                                National Electricity Plan  
 
 
 
number of electric vehicles in India is likely to be 6 millions by the year 2020 (4 million two wheelers & 2 million four 
wheelers).  The  electric  vehicles  are  likely  to  charge  their  batteries  during  day  time  i.e.  during  periods  of  high  solar 
power, when thermal power stations would be running at part load and during off-peak hours in the night after getting 
back home. This therefore would not lead to any increase in the peak electricity demand. 
 
 
4.3.7 Roof top solar programme 
India has set its renewable energy capacity addition targets to 175 GW by 2022 in view of the significant Renewable 
Energy potential in the country. This includes 100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from biomass and 5 GW 
from small hydro power. The 100 GW of solar includes 40 GW from solar rooftop. Some of the electricity demand will 
be met locally through these rooftop solar installations, leading to less requirement from the grid.  
The  likely  impact  on  electricity  demand  due  to  implementation  of  various  initiatives,  policies/programmes  of 
Government  of  India  and  the  States  has  been  suitably  incorporated  in  the  electricity  demand  projection.  The  State 
Authorities have indicated that data submitted to CEA for the 19th EPS Exercise have been arrived at by considering 
the impact of such policies/programmes on the electricity demand of respective Discoms/States/UTs. 
 
4.4 OVERVIEW OF ELECTRICITY DEMAND PROJECTION

State/UT-wise details of electrical energy requirement (ex-bus) and peak electricity demand for the years 2016-17, 2021-
22 and 2026-27 is given at Annexure-4.1 and Annexure-4.2 respectively.  
The electricity demand projection carried out by the Electric Power Survey Committee, covers electricity demand only 
for the utility system. The projections do not include the portion of electricity demand of Industries and other consumers 
that would be met from captive power plants.  
 
4.5 CAPTIVE POWER PLANTS (CPP) 
 
Large number of captive power plants including co-generation power plants of varied type and sizes exist in the country 
which is either utilized in process industry or for in-house consumption. Some plants are also installed as standby units 
for  operation  only  during  emergencies  when  the  grid  supply  is  not  available.  Captive  power  plants  including  co-
generation power plants, therefore play a supplementary role in meeting the country’s electricity demand. 
 
4.5.1   Installed Capacity and Electricity Generation from Captive Power Plants 
 
  Captive plants over the years have been evolved from plants owned by single promoter to group captive to the medium 
of  maximizing the benefit by selling its surplus power. The  Installed Capacity of  Captive Power plants (1 MW and 
above) was 44,657 MW as of 31st March, 2015. The gross electricity generation from captive power plants during the 
year 2014-15 was 162 BU. Details of the same are given in Table 4.3.

4.5.2   Status of Captive Generation- Self Use by the Industry and Electrical Energy exported to the Grid 
 
In view of the thrust being given to captive plants and also due to the liberal provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, 
encouraging feeding of surplus electricity into the grid, the captive power plants have also been feeding electricity into 
the grid. Details of the same are given in Table 4.4.

With improvement in grid supply, a scenario of grid supply partially replacing the supply from captive power plants has 
been worked out. Table 4.5 and 4.6 shows the scenario of forecast of self-use energy which will be met out of CPP 
generation (MU) from 2016-17 to 2026-27 without any transfer of industrial consumption to the utility grid and the 
forecast of self-use energy which will be met out of captive generation with transfer of 15% electrical energy from CPP 
to utility grid in the year 2021-22 and transfer of 25 % electrical energy from CPP to utility grid in the year 2026-27.

If 15% and 25% of the electricity consumed by industries from captive power plants is transferred to the utility grid in 
the years 2021-22 and 2026-27 respectively, it is estimated that additional electrical energy of about 41 BU in the year 
2021-22 and 97 BU in the year 2026-27 would be required by industries from the utility grid.  
However, since the electricity tariff  for industrial and commercial consumers are high at present as these are cross-
subsidizing small consumers, it may be cheaper for industrial and commercial consumers to take power from their own 
captive power plants. Indeed, there has been increasing interest to set up or take equity in captive power plants, signifying 
a  shift  away  from  grid  supply.  Therefore,  the  above  is  not  considered  as  a  likely  scenario  in  electricity  demand 
projections. 
4.6 CONCLUSIONS 
The electrical energy requirement and peak  electricity demand on all-India basis has been taken as per the 19th EPS 
Report to work out the generation capacity addition requirement. The EPS exercise involves all stakeholders and an 
extensive exercise has been done. Distribution company wise electricity demand projection has been carried out to arrive 
at the State, region and the all- India electricity demand projection. Electrical energy requirement and peak electricity 
demand on all-India basis adopted for generation expansion planning exercise is as under:

CHAPTER 5 
 
GENERATION PLANNING  
 
 
5.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
Electricity is one of the key enablers for achieving socio-economic development of the country. Amongst various modes 
adopted  for  meeting  the  ever  increasing  demand  of  power  to  achieve  the  targeted  growth  rate,  Generation  capacity 
augmentation is the most vital component. The economic growth leads to growth in demand of power. To meet this 
demand,  in  view  of  the  limited  available  fuel  resources  for  generation,  capacity  addition  has  to  be  planned  very 
optimally. 
 
During the 12th Plan (2012-17), a capacity addition of 99,209 MW was commissioned against target of 88,537 MW from 
conventional sources. It is for the first time in the history of the Indian power sector that such a large capacity addition 
during a single plan period was achieved which is 112 % of the target. During 11th plan the achievement in capacity 
addition was 69.84% of the target. 
 
This chapter highlights the Principles and Methodology of Generation Planning adopted to assess the capacity addition 
required from conventional energy sources by the end of year 2021-22 and 2026-27. Capacity addition target from non-
conventional energy resources has also been considered. 
 
5.1 OPTIONS FOR POWER GENERATION IN INDIA 
 
Coal is the major source for power generation in our country and since Low Carbon Growth Strategy has to be followed, 
other generation options need to be harnessed in the most optimum manner. 
 
 Fuel Options available for Power Generation are: 
 
  Conventional Sources – Coal and lignite, Hydro, Nuclear, Natural gas 
  Non-Conventional Renewable Energy Sources- Solar, Wind, Biomass, small hydro, tidal, Geothermal, Waste to 
energy, Hydrogen/ fuel cells, etc. 
 
5.2 GENERATION FROM CONVENTIONAL SOURCES IN INDIA 
 
5.2.1 Hydro 
 
Total Hydro Electric Power potential in the country was assessed as 84,044 MW (at 60% load factor) from a total of 
845 number of identified Hydro Electric Schemes, which when fully developed would result in an installed capacity of 
about 1,48,701 MW on the basis of probable average load factor.  The total energy potential is assessed as 600 billion 
units  per  year.  Hydropower  is  used  to  its  maximum  potential  for  meeting  peak  loads  and  all  new  projects  must  be 
designed with this objective in mind. However, the full development of India’s hydro-electric potential, while technically 
feasible, faces various issues including issues of water rights, resettlement of project affected people and environmental 
concerns etc. and all these issues need to be resolved to exploit full potential. As on 31.03.2017, the installed capacity 
of hydroelectric power plants in the country was 44,478 MW which is 13.6% of the total installed capacity of the country.  
 
5.2.2 Nuclear 
 
Presently, Nuclear Power Corporation India Limited is operating 21 reactors with an installed capacity  of 6,680 MW. 
Out of these 21 reactors, presently 13 reactors with an installed capacity of 4,280 MW are under IAEA Safeguards and 
use imported fuel. Remaining 8 reactors with an installed capacity of 2,400 MW use indigenous fuel. In addition to 
above, a 100 MW PHWR RAPP 1 is under long term shutdown since 2004. As on 31.03.2017, the installed capacity of 
Nuclear power plants in the country was 6,780 MW which is 2.1% of the total installed capacity of the country. 
 
5.2.3 Gas  
 
Addition of gas based capacity is considered necessary to reduce CO2 emissions and to utilise their capability to fast 
ramp-up  and  ramp-down.  The  advantage  of  fast  ramping  capability  becomes  more  important  in  view  of  large  scale 
GENERATION PLANNING                                                                                                                                                                
5.1 
Central Electricity Authority                                                                                                                                    National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
integration of renewable energy. Modern combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) have high efficiency of around 55% as 
compared to coal based plants (Gross efficiency of supercritical units is about  40%). Gas turbines/Engines could be 
located near the load centre with a view to minimize the requirement of transmission system and could be operated in a 
manner so as to maximize the output during the peak hours and minimize during the off-peak hours. 
 
 
However, the production and supply of gas had not been keeping pace with the growing demand of natural gas in the 
country, including power sector. The gas supply for gas based power stations in the country is inadequate and the country 
is facing huge generation loss. Presently, existing gas based power plants are operating at very low PLF of about 23% 
and few gas based power plants are lying idle due to non-availability of domestic natural gas.  
 
As on 31.03.2017, the installed capacity of gas based power stations was 26,167 MW (including liquid based) which is 
8 % of the total installed capacity of the country.  
 
5.2.4 Coal/Lignite 
 
Coal based power generation is backbone of Indian Power sector and will continue to dominate power generation in the 
country. Due  to environmental concerns, clean coal technologies such as supercritical technology has been adopted. 
Capacity totalling to about 35,230 MW based on Super critical technology has been commissioned during 12th plan. 
 
Lignite is available at limited locations  such as Neyveli in Tamil  Nadu, Surat,  Akrimota in Gujarat and Barsingsar, 
Palana, Bithnok in Rajasthan. Since, lignite is available at a relatively shallow depth and is non-transferable, its use for 
power generation at pithead stations is found to be attractive.   
 
The coal based installed capacity was 1,92,162.88 MW as on 31.03.2017 which was almost 58.8% of the total installed 
capacity of the country.  
 
5.3 GENERATION FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES  
 
The installed capacity from renewable energy sources was 57,244 MW as on 31.03.2017. Share of Renewable Energy 
Sources (RES) in the total installed capacity was about 17.5 %. However, the share of renewables will substantially 
increase in coming years due to major thrust given by Government of India in promoting Renewable energy sources on 
account of these sources being clean and green energy.   
 
India is one of the best recipient of solar energy due to its location in the solar belt and has vast solar potential of 749 
GW for power generation. Also, India has substantial wind potential of 103 GW due to its long coastline.  Based on the 
availability of biomass, the potential of power generation from bio mass has been assessed as around 25 GW.  Small 
hydro of capacity up to 25 MW has a power generation potential of around 20 GW.  
 
However,  generation  from  renewable  energy  sources  especially  solar  and  wind  is  variable  in  nature  and  therefore, 
requires huge balancing capacity in the system. 
 
5.4   PRINCIPLES OF GENERATION PLANNING

5.4.1 Sustainable Development 
 
The importance and relevance of power development within the confines of Clean and Green Power is the most essential 
element.  Such  a  development  depends  upon  the  choice  of  an  appropriate  fuel  /  technology  for  power  generation. 
Accordingly, the Plan takes into account the development of Hydro projects and projects based on renewable energy 
sources as well as other measures and technologies promoting sustainable development in the country.  
 
 
5.4.2 Operational Flexibility and Reliability 
 
Generating units utilising different fuels have different operational characteristics. The fuel sources and their respective 
technologies of power generation are multiple and varied. The demand of our electric system varies with time of the 
day,  season,  year  and  the  spatial  location.  Therefore,  matching  the  generation  with  demand  at  all  instances  of  time 
requires not only installation of adequate capacity but also to be sensitive to the type of generation capacity, each with 
its unique characteristics of altering its output and the time taken to do so. Accordingly, this requirement of the system 
also needs to be considered when deciding upon the type of generation. It is, therefore, necessary to widen the scope of 
the planning process to take into account aspects of ‘reliability’ and ‘quality’ of power, apart from the adequacy and 
quantum of power. 
 
5.4.2.1 Reliability of Power 
 
Reliable  power  system  operation  requires  constant  balancing  of  supply  and  demand  in  accordance  with  established 
operating criteria such as  maintaining system  voltages and frequency  within acceptable limits. Changes in customer 
demand and generation from renewable energy sources throughout the day and over the seasons are met by controlling 
generation from conventional sources when needed.  
 
To achieve reliability in the system, adequate reserve capacity, spinning as well as non-spinning, needs to be planned in 
the system. Aspects related to the operation, ownership, modalities and nature of reserves also need to be determined.  
 
The  National  Electricity  Policy,2005  stipulates  creation  of  spinning  reserve  of  5%  in  our  system.  This  has  been 
considered while planning capacity addition requirement during the years 2017-22 and 2022-27.  
 
5.4.2.2 Flexibility of operation 
 
A system that is designed for base-load generation may lack the characteristics to respond dynamically or efficiently to 
the variation in demand within a short time. Apart from variation in demand, there is expected to be wide variability in 
generation from renewable energy plants.  Since system stability requires matching of generation with the demand at 
any instance of time, a certain degree of flexibility in terms of ability of the generators to respond rapidly to the changing 
demand and generation from renewable energy sources must be introduced into the system through appropriate power 
generating plants and financial mechanism. System should also be able to meet additional demand which arises due to 
unexpected demand fluctuations and sudden outages of some generating units. 
 
5.4.3     Efficient Use of Resources  
 
The fossil fuels for power generation are scarce and must therefore be used most judiciously. From the point of view of 
environment also, it is essential that energy produced per kcal of fuel is maximum to the extent possible. This would 
minimize the pollution caused during the process of power production. 
 
5.5 PLANNING TOOLS - DETAILS OF PLANNING MODELS 
 
Generation expansion studies have been carried out in CEA using the computer software model “Electric Generation 
Expansion Analysis System” (EGEAS). Salient features of the Planning model are discussed below. 
 
The  Electric  Generation  Expansion  Analysis  System  (EGEAS)  is  a  software  package  for  expansion  planning  of  an 
electric generation system. In this planning model the operation of the power system is simulated probabilistically. The 
load on the power system is represented both in terms of magnitude and time variation. The model yields the reliability 
indices,  namely the Loss-Of-Load-Probability (LOLP), the expected value of  Energy-Not-Served (ENS), and the 
reserve margin for an expansion power plan by minimizing the objective function which is the present worth of 1) the

Central Electricity Authority                                                                                                                                    National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
costs associated with operation of the existing and committed generating stations  2) the annualized/ levelised capital 
cost and operating cost of new generating stations and 3) cost of energy not served. The EGEAS model is capable of 
giving a number of expansion plans along with their objective functions and the reliability indices for such plans. The 
optimal power plan is that plan for which the reliability indices are satisfied in accordance with criteria laid down by the 
planner, and the objective function is the lowest. 
 
 
The EGEAS model, being essentially deterministic in nature, provides for long range generation expansion planning as 
it yields very useful quantitative measures of reliability of power supply several years into the future, and at the same 
time gives an indication of the total cost of operating the existing and committed generating stations and installing and 
operating the new generating stations.  Block Diagram showing various data flows is shown in Exhibit 5.1.

Subsequently, the study results were validated using another generation expansion planning model namely ORDENA . 
The ORDENA model has following capabilities: - 
 
•  The  model  performs  Generation  Expansion  Planning,  Production  Costing  and  also  has  the  capability  of  modeling 
renewable energy sources through generation expansion planning. 
 
• The model optimizes transportation of fuel, transmission of power and emissions from power plants while addressing 
system reliability issues like Loss of Load Probability(LOLP) and Energy Not Served(ENS). The software also does 
hour-by-hour  simulation  while  recognizing  the  constraints  of  dispatch  on  generation  imposed  by  the  transmission 
system. 
 
•  The  model  has  the  capability  of  carrying  out  All-India  studies  as  well  as  studies  for  each  State/UT  considering 
import/export of power from one state to another state.

5.6 PLANNING APPROACH  
 
Planning approach has been to meet the peak demand and energy requirements. In view of generation being delicensed 
and high capacity addition programme from Renewable Energy sources, it becomes imperative to plan for more optimal 
mix of base-load capacities, peaking capacity and reserve capacities. The base load capacities will take care of ‘bulk-
power’ requirement, while the others will provide the system operator with sufficient reserve capacity and a valuable 
tool to take care  of  intermittency of renewable generation,  seasonal spikes or time-of-day  variations  – expected and 
unexpected in electricity demand.  The dynamic response characteristics of such a balanced system would be far superior 
and would contribute to higher reliability.  
 
 
As  unscheduled  intra  and  inter-regional  transfers  would  pose  challenges  and  therefore  a  right  mix  of  base  load  and 
flexible generating units must preferably be determined and planned for, at the level of the State grid itself. This will 
ensure the most rapid, real-time response to local peaking needs and variation in generation from RES.  
The Planning Approach followed is in the following sequence: 
 
5.6.1  All India Peak Demand and Energy requirement forecast 
 
Generation  expansion  planning  studies  have  been  carried  out  based  on  the  Electricity  demand  assessed  by  the  19th 
Electric Power Survey (EPS)  Report. The  estimated peak demand (MW) and Energy requirement (BU) in the  years 
2021-22 and 2026-27 are given in Table 5.1.

5.6.2 
Preparation of All India Load profile  
 
The demand data was collected for past three years (2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14) on hourly basis (8760 hrs) from 
various Regional Load Dispatch Centres. The hourly data was analysed and corrected for any discrepancies in terms of 
load shedding, frequency correction, scheduled power cuts and any data errors. Further, All India Load profile for the 
year 2021-22 and 2026-27 was generated based on respective projected Peak Demand and Energy Requirement. 
 
In view of the massive capacity addition programme from renewable energy sources (Solar and wind) during the years 
from  2017-18  to  2021-22,  the  All  India  Net  load  curve  was  obtained  from  the  All  India  Load  profile  by  treating 
generation from renewable energy sources as negative load. 
 
 The methodology adopted for arriving at “All India Net load curve” is as follows: 
 
1)  Collection  of  latest  available  hourly  generation  profile  data  for  8760  hrs  of  existing  solar  and  wind  power 
projects of various States.   
2)  Estimating  Hourly  generation  profile  data  for  States  where  profile  was  not  available  by  taking  inputs  from 
various studies carried out by MNRE. 
3)  Normalising Hourly generation profile of Solar and Wind plants. 
4)  Scaling up the hourly generation by proposed capacity addition of each State/UTs including solar rooftops.  
5)  Aggregating the hourly generation profile of all the States where Solar and Wind power capacity addition is 
envisaged. 
6)  Generate All India Net hourly load profile by treating renewable energy generation as negative load. 
 
All India hourly load profile and Net load curve (Duck Curve) is shown in Exhibit 5.2.

From Exhibit 5.4, it is seen that the system becomes peakier in view of large capacity addition from renewable energy 
sources. 
 
5.6.3  Reserve capacity 
As stipulated by National Electricity Policy 2005, 5% Spinning Reserve is to be provided.   The requirement of this 
Reserve Capacity has been incorporated in the studies by correspondingly reducing availability of conventional plants 
by 5%. It has been estimated that the likely installed capacity in 2021-22 would be around 479 GW.  Of this, RES will 
contribute around 175 GW. Therefore, 304 GW may be the likely installed capacity from the conventional sources of 
this, i.e. 15 GW, has been kept as reserve capacity, while doing the Generation Planning.  
 
71,023 
5.6.4  Generation Expansion Studies 
The All India Net load curve has been used to carry out generation expansion studies by EGEAS Software. The estimated 
energy generation and contribution towards Peak Demand from RES (Solar + Wind) has been reduced from projected 
Energy  requirement  and  Peak  Demand  figures  as  only  net  load  is  required  to  be  met  through  conventional  energy 
sources. 
Hydro and Nuclear projects were accorded priority and considered as must run projects on  account of their inherent 
advantages. However, due to non-availability of natural gas, gas based power plants have been restricted to lower PLF. 
The studies result in the capacity addition requirement of coal based projects to meet the projected Energy requirement 
and Peak demand considering given reliability criteria.   
 
5.6.5  Retirement of old thermal units 
Information  was compiled in  respect of old thermal power plants  which  have already retired and plants likely to be 
considered for retirement in future.  
71,023 
 
In  the  base  case  scenario,  a  coal  based  capacity  of  22,716  MW  (5,927  MW  +  16,789  MW)  is  considered  for 
retirement  during  2017-22.  This  is  based  upon  the  assessment  made  by  CEA  which  consists  of  5,927  MW  of 
capacity  assuming  that  the  normal  trend  of  past  retirement  process  would  continue  along  with  a  coal  based 
capacity of 16,789 MW which doesn’t have space for installation of FGD (Flu Gas Desulphurization) system to 
curb SOx emissions. The list of these units considered for retirement during 2017-22(22,716 MW) is placed at 
Annexure 5.5 and Annexure 5.5(A) respectively. 
Additionally, a coal based capacity of 25,572 MW, has been considered for retirement during 2022-27 which will 
be completing 25 years of operation by March,2027. The list of these units is given in Annexure 5.6.

5.7 NORMS ADOPTED FOR RELIABILITY CRITERIA 
 
The  Power  System  is  planned  to  meet  the  forecasted  demand  while  ensuring  an  expected  level  of  reliability. 
Reliability is a measure of the ability of a system to perform its designated function under the designed conditions. 
In our Studies, Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) is the criteria adopted to reflect the capacity of the system to meet 
the peak load and Energy Not Served (ENS) to reflect the Energy Requirement not met in the System. LOLP is the 
probability that a system will fail to meet its peak load under the specified operating conditions. It is the proportion 
of days per year or hours per year when the available generating capacity is insufficient to serve the peak demand. 
This index is dimensionless and can also be expressed as a percentage.   
 
 
ENS is the expected amount of energy which the system will be unable to supply to the consumers as a fraction of 
the total energy requirement. This index again is dimensionless and can also be expressed as a percentage. In other 
words, this indicate as to how many units of energy requirement in a year are not met and correspondingly how many 
hours in a  year the power demand is  not  met. Various countries in the  world have adopted their own  Reliability 
Criteria depending upon the status of their power system and the price affordability of the consumers to pay for the 
reliability of the system. It is evident that a more stringent and reliable system would yield higher cost of electricity 
which has to be borne by the consumer. Details of LOLP adopted in some countries are as given in Table 5.2.

5.8 PLANNING NORMS  
 
The  planning  studies  require  accurate  performance  parameters  of  various  types  of  generating  units  to  assess  their 
availability  and  energy  generation  capabilities.  The  peaking  availability  and  energy  generation  capacity  are  important 
parameters  for  meeting  the  projected  demand  of  the  country  including  various  regions.  The  key  performance  factors 
required for the planning studies are the auxiliary power consumption, heat rate, capital cost of the generating units, fuel 
cost, gross calorific value, O&M schedules, etc. Different types of generating units have varied operational performance 
and accordingly different norms have been used for thermal (coal and lignite), combined cycle gas projects, hydro and 
nuclear projects. The generation planning norms for different sizes of thermal units are different. Accordingly, separate 
categories  based  on  unit  sizes  have  been  derived.  Many  higher  size  units  of  660  MW  and  800  MW  have  been 
commissioned and have been treated as separate groups. Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) are very efficient and 
have lower heat rates, however, their availability and PLF depend on the availability of natural gas. The energy of the 
hydro  units  has  been  taken  on  the  basis  of  the  designed  energy  of  the  project  in  90%  dependable  year.  The  peaking 
availability, auxiliary power consumption, heat rate for various types of generating units, as considered in the expansion 
planning studies are given in Table 5.3, Table 5.4 and Table 5.5.

  Likely Capacity Addition  
 
a)  Hydro 
 
Considering the status of various hydro projects, a hydro capacity addition of about 6,823 MW is likely during the 
years 2017-22. Details of hydro projects are furnished in Annexure 5.1. 
Additionally, hydro projects totalling to 12,000 MW have been considered for likely benefit during the years 2022-
27. 
 The hydro projects have been considered as must run in the studies in line with our Low Carbon Growth Strategy.   
 
b)  Nuclear 
 
A  nuclear  capacity  addition  of  3,300  MW  has  been  considered  for  the  period  2017-22  as  per  the  information 
furnished by DOAE. Details are furnished at Annexure 5.2.  
A nuclear capacity addition of 6,800 MW during the years 2022-27 has been considered as per the programme of 
Department of Atomic Energy. Details are furnished at Annexure 5.3. 
 
c)  Thermal 
 
 
In view of acute  shortage of natural gas in the country, many gas based power plant are running at very low 
Plant Load Factor. A capacity of around 406 MW is ready for commissioning/under construction but stranded 
due to non-availability of natural gas. The plants have been considered available during the year 2017-22 for 
the purpose of studies. Also, as the availability of gas is uncertain, no additional gas based projects have been 
considered during the year 2022-27.  
 Gas Based Plants 
 
  Coal based Plants  
The balance capacity (after considering the committed capacity addition from hydro, nuclear, gas and RES) to 
meet the projected demand is proposed to be met from coal based power plants. 
 
  Imports: 
As  shown  in  Table  5.12,  the  electricity  hydro  imports  from  neighbouring  countries  during  2017-22  are 
expected to be 4,356 MW. The list of these projects is placed at Annexure 5.7. Net electricity (Hydro) imports 
from neighbouring countries during 2022-27 are given in the Table 5.13 below:

5.10 RESULTS OF GENERATION EXPANSION PLANNING STUDIES FOR THE PERIOD 2017-  22 AND 
2022-27  
 
The studies were carried out to assess the total capacity addition requirement to meet the projected demand in the year 
2021-22 and 2026-27 with the assumptions mentioned in para 5.9. Hydro, Gas and Nuclear based capacity are given the 
foremost priority due to their inherent advantages towards a Low Carbon Growth Strategy. Therefore, capacity from 
these sources which is likely to materialise during the year 2017-22 and 2022-27 has been considered as must run in the 
various scenarios. Renewable capacity has also been considered as must run capacity.  
Details from the study results, with energy generated by coal based power plants, their average PLF (with likely capacity 
addition of 47,855 MW from coal based power plants (Annexure 5.4), already under construction, for benefits during 
2017-22) are shown in the Tables 5.14(a), (b) and (c) given below.

With this committed capacity addition, retirements, etc., the additional coal based capacity required by  2021-22 and 
2026-27 to meet the peak demand and energy demand would be as follows:

Remarks 
Since 47,855 MW are under different stages of 
construction  and  are  likely  to  materialise 
during  2017-22,  so  no  additional  capacity  is 
required.  
This is in addition to 47,855 MW of coal based 
capacity  which  is  in  different  stages  of 
construction and is likely to materialise during 
2017-22.

It may be seen from study results shown in Table 5.14 that out of the Coal based capacity of 47,855 MW at various 
stages of construction and is likely to be commissioned during 2017-22 only 6,445 MW capacity would be required 
along with committed capacity addition of Hydro 6,823 MW, Gas 406 MW, Nuclear 3,300 MW, RES 1,17,756 
MW and considering a retirement of coal based capacity of 22,716 MW.  
 
 
 
The overall PLF of coal based capacity during 2021-22 is likely to be 56.5%. However, the plant wise PLF may vary as 
shown in the Exhibit 5.5 and 5.6 below.

Coal based capacity of 47,855 MW which are at various stages of construction and likely to yield benefit during 2017-
22 are considered for the studies. Apart from this, coal based capacity of 9,150 MW and gas based capacity of 3501.88 
MW (Annexure 5.8) are uncertain due to fuel issues. In addition to this, coal based capacity of 88,400 MW (Annexure 
5.9) are at various stages of planning. Out of under construction hydro projects totalling to 10,608 MW, only hydro 
projects totalling to 6,823 MW have been considered for studies which are most likely to yield benefits during 2017-22. 
                                                                                                      
 
 
5.10.1 Comparison of Study Results with Projected Capacity Addition in Previous NEP 
 
In the previous NEP, the tentative capacity addition requirement during the period 2017-22 was projected as 86,400 
MW (however target set for 12th plan was 88,537 MW) based on the projected Peak demand and Energy requirement as 
per 18th Electric Power Survey (EPS) Report. The projected Peak Demand and Energy requirement in the year 2021-22

was  2,83,470  MW  and  1904 BU  respectively  as  per  the  18th  EPS  Report.    However,  the  Peak  Demand  and  Energy 
Requirement  during  2021-22  as  projected  by  19th  EPS  report  is  2,25,571  MW  and  1566  BU  respectively.    Also,  a 
capacity of 99,209 MW has been commissioned against a target of 88,537 MW during 12th plan (2012-17). Therefore, 
during 12th plan, capacity addition to the extent of 10,672 MW has been commissioned in excess of 12th Plan target. In 
addition, Government of India has announced huge capacity addition programme from Renewable Energy sources so as 
to have installed capacity of 1,75,000 MW from RES by the end of year 2021-22. All these factors have contributed to 
the reduction in capacity addition requirement during the period 2017-22. 
 
 
5.11 ALTERNATE SCENARIOS FOR CAPACITY ADDITION  
 
Generation expansion planning is a major part of any power system planning studies and is normally carried out for the 
next 5-10 years.  These studies are performed based on various assumptions and factors prevalent at that time. However, 
there are various uncertainties associated with the input data such as demand forecasts, availability of fuel, investment, 
committed units, retirement plans, input fuel prices, availability of technology, various initiatives of Government like 
promotion of energy efficiency, etc.  As a result, generation expansion planning is essentially stochastic in nature. 
 
Forecasting electricity demand is most challenging and consequently, a very vital parameter for generation expansion 
planning. There are numerous ways to forecast electricity demand based on the assumptions made. 
 
Estimation of electricity demand for a developing country like India is much more challenging than that of a developed 
country. In a developed country, because of the matured stage of development, the growth is considered to be steady 
and therefore, it is relatively easy to forecast electricity demand. However, in a developing country, there may not be a 
definite trajectory of growth as it is dependent on the economic performance, Government policies & programmes and 
their extent of successful implementation thereof, etc.  
 
Based on methodology adopted (Chapter 3) in estimating electricity demand in future years considering DSM measures, 
the electricity energy requirement for the  year 2021-22 has been estimated as 1566 BU with a Compounded Annual 
Growth  Rate  (CAGR)  of  6.18%  with  reference  to  2016-17.  However,  due  to  uncertainties  associated  with  demand 
forecasting, one additional scenario has been considered in the Generation planning studies i.e. CAGR of 7.18 % as 
shown in Exhibit 5.9 below: 
 
CAGR: 6.18%:

An alternate scenario has been constructed based on variation in projected energy demand to get a clear picture of the 
effect of variation of Energy Demand on the requirement of additional capacity.  
 
5.11.1 Results of Alternate scenario (2017-22) 
 
 
The generation planning studies for the period 2017-22 has also been carried out for the demand CAGR of 7.18% and 
keeping other parameters unchanged as the base case, the coal based capacity addition and their expected Plant Load 
factor % are shown in the Tables 5.17(b) and (c) below.

With the  committed capacity  addition, retirement,  etc. (as  given  in  Table 5.14(a)), the  addition coal based capacity 
required by 2021-22 to meet the peak demand and energy demand would be as follows:

Remarks 
Since  47,855  MW  are  under  different

It may  be  seen that in this case  also  no additional coal based capacity addition is required apart from the under 
construction coal projects likely to benefit during the years 2017-22 to meet the peak and energy demand. 
 
5.11.2 Analysis of Results (2017-22) 
1)  With committed capacity addition of Hydro 6,823 MW, Gas 406 MW, Nuclear 3,300 MW, RES 1,17,756 MW 
and considering a retirement of coal based capacity of 22,716 MW with demand CAGR of 6.18% during 2017-
22, only 6,445 MW coal based capacity would be required for the said period, whereas coal based capacity of 
47,855 MW is at various stages of construction and is likely to be commissioned during 2017-22  
GENERATION PLANNING

2) 
In the alternate scenarios with demand CAGR of 7.18%, keeping the capacity addition from RES and Hydro, 
Retirement of units constant, it is observed that coal based capacity addition of 19,700 MW may be required 
during 2017-22. However, 47,855 MW of coal based plants are in different stages of construction and would 
yield benefit during 2017-22.  With this capacity addition the energy demand and peak demand for 2021-22 
would be fully met. 
 
 
3)  The PLF of the thermal plants would be influenced to the extent of achievement of capacity addition from RES, 
Hydro, etc. and retirement of units.  
 
4)  Significant quantum of capacity retirement would have a corresponding significant positive impact on the PLF 
of the thermal plants.  
 
5.11.3 Analysis of Results (2022-27) 
 
1) 
It may be seen that capacity addition to the tune of 46,420 MW will be required under the given set of 
parameters. This will be in addition to the 47,855 MW of coal based capacity which would likely benefit 
during 2017-22. 
 
2)  The excess coal based capacity available by March, 2022 would help to  meet the increase in demand 
during 2022-27 resulting better utilisation of plants. 
 
3)  The additional capacity required for 2022-27 should be preferably from flexible sources of generation to 
meet the peaking, balancing and ramping requirements of the grid. 
 
4)  However,  if  this  additional  capacity  comes  from  the  coal  based  plants,  the  PLF  of  coal  based  power 
stations will be in the range of 61-62% by 2026-27.  
 
5) 
If the additional capacity comes from other flexible sources, the PLF of the coal based plants would further 
increase. 
  
5.12 CONCLUSIONS  
 
 
The Electricity demand projections considered for planning the capacity addition requirement, are as follows: 
 
Year 
Energy Requirement 
 ( BU)  
Peak Demand (MW) 
1,566 
2,047 
225.751 
298.774 
2021-22 
2026-27 
 
These values are in accordance with the Report of 19th Electric Power Survey Committee.   
 
Considering the demand projections for the year 2021-22 as per the 19th EPS, committed capacity addition from 
Gas 406 MW, Hydro 6,823 MW, Nuclear 3,300 MW, RES 1,17,756 MW and likely retirement of 22,716 MW of 
coal based capacity during 2017-22, the study result reveals that coal based capacity addition of 6,445 MW is 
required  during  the  period  2017-22.  However,  a  total  capacity  of  47,855  MW  coal  based  power  projects  are 
currently  under  different  stages  of  construction  and  are  likely  to  yield  benefits  during  the  period  2017-22. 
Thereby, the total capacity addition during 2017-22 is likely to be 1,76,140 MW. 
 
 
 
In view of the prevailing shortage of natural gas in the country, no additional gas based power plant has been 
planned  during  2017-22,  except  the  plants  which  are  presently  ready  for  commissioning  /under  construction. 
However, in case availability of natural gas improves, preference may be given to gas based power plants owing 
to their advantage in efficiently helping in balancing the Grid and reducing emissions. 
 
  Considering the demand projections for the  year 2026-27 as per the 19th EPS, coal based capacity addition of 
47,855  MW  already  under  construction  for  benefits  during  2017-22,  committed  capacity  addition  of  Nuclear

during 2022-27, study results reveals that capacity addition of 46,420 MW is required during the period 2022-27. 
This capacity addition required during 2022-27 as shown in the results is in fact the peaking capacity requirement 
to be met in the grid. This capacity requirement can be met from any conventional source of energy. 
 
 
  It is estimated that Generation from RES will contribute almost 20.1 % of the energy requirement in the year 
2021-22. 
 
  Net Imports from neighbouring countries will increase from 4,356 MW in the year 2021-22 to 21,600 MW in the 
year 2026-27.  
 
  The actual CAGR of energy demand between the years 2012-13 to 2015-16 is 4.42%. However, the CAGR of 
energy demand between 2015-16 and 2021-22 has been estimated as 6.18%. This is substantially higher that of 
the immediate past keeping in view secular increase in demand and increase due to implementation of PFA and 
other Government of India programs between the years 2017-22.  
 
 
It has been assumed that Gas Power Plants will operate at minimum load as carried out presently during the off-
peak  hours  and  ramp  up  during  the  time  of  peaking  requirement  in  the  grid.  This  operation  amounts  to  their 
combined PLF of around 37%. The gas requirement may decrease provided two shift operation during the day 
becomes feasible for Gas power stations. 
 
 
  Energy demand of 1566 BU and Peak Demand of 226 GW in March 2022 with CAGR of 6.18% look realistic 
and most likely to occur. Even with Energy Demand of 1641 BU and Peak Demand of 237 GW in March 2022 
with CAGR of 7.18%, sufficient capacity would be available to meet the demand. 
 
  Even with the incidence of higher demand by 2021-22 like shifting of Captive load to the grid, there would be 
adequate capacity to take care of this increase in demand. 
 
  Any negative deviation with respect of capacity addition target from RES, Hydro, etc. would have positive impact 
on the PLF of the coal-based plants. 
 
  Similarly, any positive deviation of projected demand in future would have a positive impact on the PLF of the 
coal based plants.   
 
  Even retirement to the extent of 22,716 MW during 2017-22 due to strict implementation of environmental norms, 
would not likely pose any problem in meeting the demand during 2021-22. 
 
  It is envisaged that the rate of capacity addition particularly from  coal based stations may outpace the rate of 
increase in demand during the period from 2017-22. The PLF of the coal based stations is likely to come down 
to around 56.5% by 2021-22 with the normal retirement of unit, likely demand with CAGR of 6.18% and 175 
GW of capacity from RES. Any deviation of the above independent variable would have an impact on the PLF 
of the coal based stations as already mentioned above. 
 
  During the period of 2022-27, the PLF of the thermal plants shall progressively increase and would be hovering 
around 60-61% by 2026-27.  
 
  For any capacity addition from conventional sources in future, capability of flexibility of generation should be 
insisted upon. 
 
  The Hydro Power can also contribute significantly to meet balancing requirement of the grid but is constrained 
due to vagaries associated with seasonal inflows to the reservoir. Also, the hydro capacity will constitute around 
10.7 % of the total Installed Capacity in 2022. The peaking requirement to be met from Gas may also reduce if 
the Government’s policy push for Hydro Power Development is able to yield desired results.

CHAPTER  6 
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES  
6.0   INTRODUCTION 
The World Energy Forum has predicted that fossil-based oil, coal and gas reserves will be exhausted in less than 
another 10 decades. This coupled with the urgent need of arresting the adverse climatic changes has forced planners 
and policy makers to look for alternate sources.  
 
The 2015 United Nation Climate Conference in Paris is a milestone in global climatic co-operation. It reaffirmed the 
need to have a rapid and global transition to renewable energy technologies to achieve sustainable development and 
avoid catastrophic climatic change. 195 countries adopted the first universal, legally binding global climate deal.  
In fact, many of the countries throughout the world have already embraced renewable energy technologies 
significantly in order to meet their electricity demand and reduce emissions. 
  
6.1 GLOBAL SCENERIO OF ELECTRICITY GENERATION FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES 
The International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook projects a growth of renewable energy supply from 1,700 
GW in 2014 to 4,550 GW in 2040 on a global basis. 
Global renewable generation capacity at the end of 2015 stood at 1,985 GW. 152 GW renewable generation capacity 
was added in 2015. The growth in renewable capacity addition during 2015 was 8.3%. Share of Asia in renewable 
capacity addition in 2015 was 58%. (Source: IRENA) 
In 2015, California received over 20% of its electricity from renewable energy (excluding large hydro). By 2020, 
California’s Renewable Portfolio Standard Policy requires a 33% share of renewables. 
 In October 2015, the Government of Argentina passed a new law to raise the share of renewables to 20% by 2025, 
and this includes a number of new measures to realize this target. 
Germany is a global leader in adopting high share of renewable energy. Renewables already provide close to 30% of 
Germany’s power on an average basis. On some peak days in 2014, solar and wind alone supplied close to 80% of 
peak power demand at specific times of the day. Germany is targeting a 50% share of renewables by 2030 and 80% by 
2050 and planned to phase out nuclear power by 2022. 
Denmark is a world leader in wind power, with 39% of the country’s electricity coming from wind in 2015. Denmark 
is targeting 50% of its electricity from wind power by 2020, and 100% of its electricity from all forms of renewables 
by 2035. 
In December 2014, the Turkish Government approved its National Renewable Energy Action Plan, targeting a 30% 
renewable energy share in power generation and 10% in transport by 2023. 
The European Union (EU) as a whole had a 27% renewable share in 2014.  
Among developing countries, China, India, South Africa, and several other countries have already initiated ambitious 
plans of capacity addition from Renewable Energy Sources(RES).  
China’s solar PV target for 2015 increased from 17.8 GW to 23.1 GW, which includes projects that began 
construction in 2015 and will be commissioned by the end of June 2016. This increase suggests that the 2020 target 
could be revised upward from 100 to 150 GW for solar PV and from 200 to 250 GW for wind, with strong interest and 
engagement from provinces. 
In October 2015, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) set a 23% renewable energy target for 
primary energy to be reached by 2025. 
In early 2015, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) released its region-specific renewable 
electricity target of 75.6 terawatt-hours (TWh), which would be 31% of total generation in 2030. 
 In India, as on 31st March,2017, the total RES capacity was 57,244.24 MW out of total installed generation capacity 
of 326,832.6 MW. This represents almost 17.5% of the total installed capacity. An Action Plan has been formulated by 
Government of India for achievement of a total capacity of 1,75,000 MW from Renewable Energy Sources by March, 
2022.

6.2 RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES  
Renewable energy sources are those that are continually replenished by nature and derived directly from the sun (such 
as thermal, photo-chemical, and photo-electric), indirectly from the sun (such as wind, hydropower, and 
photosynthetic energy stored in biomass), or from other natural movements and mechanism of the environment (such 
as geothermal and tidal energy). This includes electricity and heat generated from solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, 
biomass, geothermal resources and biofuels. 
 
A description of the dominant forms of Renewable Energy Sources is outlined below:- 
6.2.1 Solar Power 
Solar energy generation involves the use of the sun’s energy to provide hot water via solar thermal system or 
electricity via solar photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. These technologies are technically 
well proven with numerous systems installed around the world over the last few decades. 
6.2.1.1   Solar Photovoltaic 
Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems directly convert solar energy into electricity. The basic building block of a PV system 
is the PV cell, which is a semiconductor device that converts solar energy into direct-current electricity. PV module is 
formed by interconnecting a large number of PV cells. The PV modules are combined with a set of application-
dependent system components to form a PV system. Modular PV systems are linked together to provide power 
ranging from a few watts to tens of megawatts. 
The most established solar PV technologies are silicon based systems. More recently, thin film modules consisting of 
non-silicon semiconductor materials have become important. Thin films generally have a lower efficiency than silicon 
modules. However, price per unit of capacity is lower in thin films.  
Solar PV has the advantage of economies of scale as module manufacturing can be done in large plants. Further, in 
addition to direct sunlight, it can use diffused sunlight which helps it to produce power when sky is not clear. Exhibit 
6.1 shows global annual PV market till 2016.

6.2.1.2  Concentrated Solar Power 
In Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology, a concentrated direct beam solar irradiance is used to heat a 
liquid, solid or gas that is used in a downstream process for electricity generation. Large scale CSP plants most 
commonly concentrate sunlight by reflection, as opposed to refraction with lenses. Concentration is done on to 
a line (linear focus) as in central receiver or on a dish system. CSP technology can be used to produce 
electricity from small distributed systems of tens of kW to large centralized power station of hundreds of MW.  
 
 
Exhibit 6.2 shows the global installed and planned Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) capacity distributed by 
country.

6.2.2 Wind Power 
Wind power is produced through conversion of kinetic energy associated with wind to mechanical energy first and 
then to electrical energy. The amount of kinetic energy in the wind that is theoretically available for extraction 
increases with the cube of the wind speed. However, a turbine only captures a fraction of that available energy (40-
50%). In order to maximize energy capture, turbine designs, including materials used for turbine, blade sizes etc., have 
been undergoing changes. The objective has been to minimize total cost of power produced from wind turbine by 
capturing maximum wind energy and efficient conversion thereof into reliable electrical energy.  
Electrical conversion system is very important as far as reliability is concerned. For large grid-connected turbines, 
electrical conversion system comes in different forms:  
i)  Fixed Speed Induction Generators  
ii)  Variable Speed Machines.  
The fixed speed induction generator wind turbines are net consumers of reactive power that has to be supplied by the 
electric network. These turbines can provide real and reactive power as well as some fault ride-through capability, all 
of which are required by electric network operators. 
 Exhibit 6.3 shows the global installed wind power capacity as well as installed capacity of top 10 wind power 
generating countries.

6.2.3  Biomass Power 
 
Biomass energy is the use of living and recently dead biological material as an energy source. As an energy source, 
biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of 
bio fuel. Most of today's biomass power plants are direct-fired systems, which are similar to most fossil-fuel fired 
power plants. The renewable biomass fuels are converted to heat and then to electricity. Theoretically, it is a carbon 
neutral source of energy. 
 
The biomass used for electricity generation range from forest by-products (wood residues), agricultural waste (sugar 
cane residue & rice husk) and animal husbandry residues (poultry litter etc.).   
 
6.2.4 Small Hydro Power 
 
Small hydro power plants utilize the flow of water to rotate the blades of the turbine which in turn drives the generator 
for producing electrical energy. The amount of energy generated depends on the amount of water flowing through the 
turbine as well as the size of the turbine. Small hydro power plants are generally used as standalone power systems in 
remote areas.   
 
6.2.5 Wave and Tidal Power  
 
Wave power, which captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and tidal power, which converts the energy of tides, 
are two forms of hydro power with future potential. However, they are not yet widely employed commercially.  
 
6.3   POTENTIAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION IN INDIA  
 
In order to arrest the climate change and in view of the depleting conventional energy sources, India is taking firm 
steps towards the development of renewable energy.  India has significant potential of electricity generation from 
Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The Renewable Energy (RE) potential in India is estimated at 8,96,602 MW 
comprising of 7,48,991 MW of Solar Power, 1,02,772 MW of Wind Power, 19,749 MW of Small Hydro Power and 
25,090 MW of Bio-Energy. The State-wise estimated potential of renewable power in the country is placed at 
Annexure-6.1 (Source: MNRE). 
  
 
The Government of India, in pursuit of energy security and for minimizing impact on environment, has been 
prioritizing the development of RE sector through its policies and programmes. Wind, Solar and Small Hydro are three 
emerging renewable energy sources. Wind energy and solar energy resources maps of India are shown in Exhibit 6.4.

The description of dominant forms of the renewable energy sources in India is outlined below: 
6.3.1 Solar 
It has been observed that solar as viable alternative for power generation among the available clean energy sources, has 
the highest global warming mitigation potential. India is one of the best recipients of solar energy due to its favourable 
location in the solar belt (400 S to 400 N). India has a vast potential for solar power generation since about 58% of the 
total land area (1.89 million km2) receives annual average global insolation above 5 kWh/m2/day. The Gangetic plains 
(trans, middle and upper), plateau (central, western and southern) region, western dry region, Gujarat plains and hill 
region as well as the west coast plains and Ghat region receive annual global insolation above 5 kWh/m2/day. These 
zones include states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, 
Haryana, Punjab, Kerala, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The eastern part of Ladakh region (Jammu & Kashmir) 
and minor parts of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Sikkim which  are located in the Himalayan belt also receive 
similar average global insolation annually. The eastern Himalayan states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Assam 
receive annual average global insolation below 4 kWh/m2/day.  
6.3.2 Wind 
The  development  of wind  power  in  India began  in  the  1986  with  first  windfarms  being  set  up  in  coastal  areas  of 
Maharashtra (Ratnagiri), Gujarat (Okha) and Tamil Nadu (Tuticorin) with 55 kW Vestas wind turbines. The capacity 
has significantly increased in the last few years. Although a relative newcomer to the wind industry, India has the fourth 
largest  installed wind  power capacity  in  the  world  after  China,  USA  and  Germany. The  short  gestation  periods  for 
installing wind turbines, and the increasing reliability and performance of wind energy machines has made wind power 
a favoured choice for electricity generation in India. The wind power projects in India are mainly spread across south, 
west and north regions while east and north-east regions have no grid connected wind power plant.  
Wind power generation in India is highly influenced by the monsoon in India. The strong south-west monsoon, starts in 
May-June, when cool, humid air moves towards the land and the weaker north-east monsoon, starts in October, when 
cool dry air moves towards the ocean. During the period of March to August, the winds are uniform and strong over the 
whole Indian peninsula, except the eastern peninsular coast. Wind speed during the period of November to March is 
relatively weak.  
No offshore wind farm utilizing traditional fixed-bottom wind turbine technology in shallow sea areas or floating wind 
turbine technology in deep sea areas are under implementation. An offshore wind policy was announced in 2015 and

presently  weather stations and LIDARS( light detection and ranging) are being set  up by National Institute of Wind 
Energy (NIWE) at some locations. 
6.3.3 Biomass 
About  32%  of  the  total  primary  energy  use  in  the  country  is  still  derived  from  biomass  and  more  than  70%  of  the 
country’s population depends upon it for its energy needs. The current availability of biomass in India is estimated at 
about 500 million metric tonnes per year, covering agricultural and forestry residues corresponding to a potential of 
about 18,000 MW. Additional 7,000 MW power could be generated through bagasse based cogeneration in the country. 
6.3.4 Small Hydro 
Hydro power plants of capacity up to 25 MW are categorized as small hydro power plants. The estimated potential for 
power generation in the country from such plants is about 20,000 MW. Most of the potential is in Himalayan States as 
river-based projects and in other States on irrigation canals.  
6.4 DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLES IN INDIA 
There has been a significant increase in renewable energy capacity in the country during the last decade. The installed 
capacity of renewables in India was 7,761 MW as at the end of 10th plan (i.e. on 31st March,2007) and the same had 
grown to 24,504 MW at the end of 11th plan (i.e. on 31st March,2012). With a consistent growth, the installed capacity 
of renewable energy sources has reached 57,244.24 MW as on 31st March,2017. The installed capacity of grid connected 
renewable power plants in India is shown in Table 6.1.

Muppandal windfarm in Tamil Nadu with the total capacity of 1500 MW, is the largest in the country. 
 
The National Solar Mission (NSM) launched in January 2010 has given a great boost to the solar scenario in the 
country. As of 31st March,2017, the installed capacity of solar power in India was 12,288.83 MW, which is 21.5 % of 
total Renewable installed capacity in India. This solar capacity is mainly spread across Andhra Pradesh (1867.23 
MW), Rajasthan (1812.93 MW), Tamil Nadu (1691.83 MW), Telangana (1286.98 MW), Gujarat (1249.37 MW), 
Madhya Pradesh (857.04 MW), Punjab (793.95 MW), etc. The installed capacity of biomass power in India as on 31 st 
March,2017 was 8295.78 MW, which is 14.5% of total renewable installed capacity in India. Small hydropower with 
capacity of 4379.86 MW as on 31st March,2017 represents 7.17% of total renewable installed capacity in India. Total

6.5 RENEWABLE ENERGY TARGET BY 2022 
Over the years, renewable energy sector in India is emerging as a significant player in the grid connected power 
generation capacity. It is well recognized that renewable energy has to play a much bigger role in achieving energy 
security in the years ahead and to be an integral part of the energy planning process. Renewable energy sector is now 
poised for a quantum jump as India has reset its renewable energy capacity addition target so as to have an installed 
capacity of 175 GW by 2022, in view of the significant renewable energy potential in the country and commitment 
made by the investors/stakeholders. The targeted contribution of the major renewable energy sources to reach the 
capacity of 175 GW by 2022 is shown in Table 6.2.

The substantial higher capacity target of renewables will ensure greater energy security, improved energy access and 
enhanced employment opportunities. With the accomplishment of these ambitious targets, India will become one of 
the largest Green Energy producers in the world, surpassing several developed countries. Renewable Energy target of 
India type-wise and region-wise, by 2022 is shown in Exhibit 6.6 and Exhibit 6.7 respectively.

6.6 PROJECTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION 
 
Based on the projections of capacity addition targets from Renewable Energy Sources by the year 2021-22 as 
furnished by MNRE and considering an RES capacity addition of 1,00,000 MW during the period 2022-27, expected 
electricity generation from various renewable energy sources has been estimated and is given in Table 6.4 and 
Exhibit 6.9. It can be seen that contribution of RES will be around 21% of the total energy of the country in the year 
2021-22 and 24% by 2026-27.

6.8  RECENT RENEWABLE ENERGY INITIATIVES 
 
6.8.1 Solar Parks 
Government of India has chalked out the target of developing 100 GW of solar power plants by 2022. Solar parks are 
basically  clearly  demarcated  development  zones  with  proper  infrastructure  like  roads  and  other  amenities.  State 
Governments or EPC developers acquire the land, put up transmission lines, get the required government permissions 
and  approvals,  and  offer  the  facility  to  the  companies  who  can  put  up  their  solar  projects  on  the  land  and  offer  the 
operators a fee. Thus, the risk associated with the projects are greatly minimized. 
 
 
The first solar park in the country was established at Charanka solar park in Gujarat. This was closely followed by the 
Bhadla solar park in Rajasthan. The concept of solar parks has given an impetus for rapid development of solar power 
projects in the country. 34 no of solar parks in 21 States with an aggregate capacity of 20,000 MW have been approved. 
Large size projects have a potential to bring down the cost of solar power. Therefore, Ultra-Mega Solar power projects 
having capacity of 500 MW or above have been proposed. Large chunks of land are available in a few States for solar 
park development. 
6.8.2 National Offshore Wind Energy Policy, 2015  
Under the policy, the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has been authorized as the nodal Ministry for 
the use of offshore area within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the country and the National Institute of Wind 
Energy (NIWE) has been authorized as the nodal agency for development of offshore wind energy in the country and 
to carry out the allocation of offshore wind energy blocks, coordination and allied functions with related ministries and 
agencies. It would pave the way for offshore wind energy development including setting up of offshore wind power 
projects and research and development activities, in waters, in or adjacent to the country, up to the seaward distance of 
200 nautical miles (EEZ of the country) from the base line. Preliminary assessments along the 7,600 km long Indian 
coastline have indicated prospects of development of offshore wind power. With the introduction of the National 
Offshore Wind Energy Policy, the Government is attempting to replicate the success of the onshore wind power 
development in the area of offshore wind power development.  
The scheme would be applicable throughout the country depending upon the offshore wind potential availability. 
6.8.3 Indian Wind and Solar Resources Atlas 2015 
Wind Energy Resources Map of India at 100 meter above ground level and Solar Radiation Map at ground level on 
online Geographic Information System (GIS) platform has been launched. This online Wind Atlas is available online 
on the NIWE website www.niwe.res.in. The Wind and Solar Resource maps will not only help and guide the wind & 
solar power developers and other stakeholders in identifying potential areas for the development of wind & solar 
power projects in the country but also help the central and state agencies in planning and developing the infrastructure 
including transmission system, required for installing renewable power projects in these potential areas. 
6.8.4 Solar Cities 
Under the programme of development of Solar Cities, the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy(MNRE) has 
approved 56 solar city projects, against the target of development of 60 nos. of Solar Cities.  The Solar Cities 
programme is designed to support/encourage urban local bodies to prepare a road map to guide their cities in 
becoming renewable energy cities or Solar Cities. 
The ministry has already initiated various programmes in the urban sector for promoting solar water heating systems 
in homes, hotels, hostels, hospitals and industry; deployment of SPV systems/devices in urban areas for demonstration 
and awareness creation; establishment of ‘Akshya Urja Shops’; design of Solar Buildings and promoting urban and 
industrial waste/biomass to energy projects. The solar city programme aims to consolidate all the efforts of the 
ministry in the urban sector and address the energy problem of the urban areas in a holistic manner. 
The Solar City programme aims to: 
 
Enable and empower urban local governments to address energy challenges at city-level. 
 
Provide  a  framework  and  support  to  prepare  a  Master  Plan  including  assessment  of  current 
energy situation, future demand and action plans. 
 
Build capacity in the urban local bodies and create awareness among all sections of civil society. 
 
Involve various stakeholders in the planning process.

 
Oversee the implementation of sustainable energy options through public-private partnerships. 
6.8.5 Solar pump 
The Government has implemented a scheme to install one lakh solar pumps for irrigation and drinking water through 
state nodal agencies and NABARD. These pumps would help lakhs of farmers in increasing outputs, income and also 
in providing drinking  water. According to estimates,  drinking  water problems  will be solved for more than 7.6 lakh 
families through solar pumps for drinking water. MNRE provides 30% capital subsidy to farmers for installation of solar 
pumps  for  irrigation  purpose  through  state  nodal  agencies.  The  state  governments  can  give  additional  subsidy.  The 
Government  presented  40%  subsidy  with  mandatory  loan  to  farmers  for  irrigation  purpose  through  NABARD.  The 
ministry has issued supplementary guidelines for 1,00,000 solar pumps during 2014-15 and a sum of ₹ 353.50 crores 
was released to various agencies for the purpose. 
6.8.6 Solar projects under National Solar Mission 
Union Cabinet approved the implementation of scheme for setting up of 15,000 MW of grid-connected solar PV power 
projects under the National Solar Mission through NTPC/NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited (NVVNL) in the three 
tranches namely, 3000 MW under tranche-I under mechanism of bundling with unallocated coal based thermal power 
and fixed levellised tariffs, 5,000 MW under tranche-II with support from government to be decided after getting some 
experience while implementing tranche-I and balance 7,000 MW under tranche-III  without any financial support from 
the government. Successful completion of additional 15,000 MW capacity of grid-connected solar PV power generation 
projects with largely private investment under the National Solar Mission would accelerate the process of achieving grid 
tariff parity for solar power and would also help in reducing consumption of kerosene and diesel, which is presently in 
use to meet the unmet demand.  
6.9 GENERATION PROFILE OF SOLAR AND WIND 
Normally generation from a solar plant gradually increases after dawn and reaches a maximum around noon and then 
gradually decreases and becomes zero with the advent of evening. An ideal generation profile of a solar plant is shown 
in Exhibit 6.10.

However, the generation from an individual PV system may not be very smooth. Because of the cloud movement, the 
generation would be affected. Cloud movement is highly unpredictable. This makes the output from a solar plant 
uncertain. Cloud cover can result in very rapid changes in the output of individual PV systems. The uncertainty 
associated with the output of a single PV system can be smoothened out in two ways- i) aggregating a large no. of PV 
systems and ii) aggregating the output of different PV systems scattered at dispersed geographic locations. As the 
number of PV plants increases, their normalized, aggregate output becomes smoother as shown in Exhibit 6.11.

Wind energy is subjected to daily and seasonal weather patterns. Changes in wind generation occur slowly during the 
course of hours during approaching storm. This is different from the solar generation where changes occur rapidly and 
variation may be from second to second due to cloud cover. A typical daily wind generation curve is shown in Exhibit 
6.12.

The solar and wind energy generation varies from not just one day to another but also from one season to other over 
the year. The variations of projected maximum solar and wind generation for each day over the year 2021-22 are 
shown in Exhibit 6.14. As can be seen from the graph, months of June to September have high generation from both 
solar and wind sources. However, it may be noted that the solar and wind peaks don’t occur simultaneously. 
Therefore, at any hour during the day, the total projected VRE generation will always be less than the algebraic sum of 
the individual projected peak solar and peak wind generation.

Days of the Year
 
 
It can be seen that the maximum generation from VRE sources would be available during the day at noon time when 
the system demand is very low. During evening, the availability of generation from VRE is very limited. In India, 
normally the peak demand occurs in the evening. During that time, limited generation from VRE would be available. 
This would make the Net Demand Curve very steep requiring the availability of flexible generation that can ramp-up 
very quickly.  The ramping requirement for 2021-22 for 8760 hours (24X365) has been estimated and is shown in 
Exhibit- 6.17.

It is evident from the curves that the ramping requirements for Net Load Curve is much higher than the original Load 
Curve. 
Capacity Utilization Factor (CUF) is the ratio of the actual output from a plant over the period to the maximum 
possible output from it for the period under ideal conditions. CUF for RES is generally very low. A typical example of 
the change of CUF for wind generator and a solar generator over different months of the year is shown in Exhibit

6.10   INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES IN THE GRID 
The share of renewables in the overall generation mix of the country is increasing steadily. The Government of India’s 
ambitious plan of having RES capacity of 175 GW by March, 2022 has accelerated the capacity addition from 
Renewable Energy Sources(RES). The capacity addition from RES has opened up opportunities as well as challenges. 
A distinct difference exists between conventional generating plants and RES. The generation from the conventional 
plants can be programmed to vary as per the requirement of loads. That is why it is called dispatchable generation.  
Generation from Variable Renewable Energy Sources like wind and solar power depends on nature and hence is called 
non-dispatchable. Further variability and uncertainty are the two aspects associated with generation from Variable 
Renewable Energy (VRE). Variability refers to the variation of generation over a period of time. For example, 
generation from solar plants is expected to follow a fixed pattern like maximum generation during noon time and 
“NIL” at night. Similarly, generation from wind follows seasonal pattern- maximum during monsoon.  
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES                                                                                                                                                                
6.18 
Central Electricity Authority                                                                                                                                    National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
Uncertainty refers to the unpredictability of generation from VRE. For example, generation from solar plants are 
expected to be maximum during noon. But due to cloud cover, the generation may get affected. This is the uncertainty 
part of solar generation. Furthermore, in conventional power plants, power generated from the plants are transported 
through high voltage transmission links and then distributed to the consumers through distribution networks. In case of 
RES, the generating plants are mostly connected at the distribution levels or at customers’ end. There may be bi-
directional flow of electricity- from grid to customers and from customers to the grid. As the generation from VRE are 
variable and uncertain, requisite balancing power from conventional sources and energy storage devices is required to 
be made available as reserve to ensure that demand at any time is fully met. Another aspect that needs consideration is 
that the generation from solar plants peaks when the demand during the day is low and has zero generation in the 
evening when the load on the grid is maximum. This requires fast ramping up capabilities of conventional generators. 
Therefore, integrating this VRE sources into the existing grid offers a challenge. The basic principle governing the 
integration of VRE sources into the grid is to ensure the integrity, security and reliability of the grid. More than 
anything else, integration of VRE into the grid poses technological and operational challenges.  
Some of the challenges that need to be addressed are discussed below: 
 
6.10.1 Flexibility Associated with Conventional Generating Units 
To accommodate the variability and uncertainty of generation from RES, the conventional generating plants must be 
flexible. The flexibility of generating station refers to its ability (i) to cycle on and off including its lead time required; 
(ii) the ramping rate at which it can vary the generation; and (iii) maximum and minimum output while it is in 
operation. 
The IEA provides a generic characterization of the differences between flexible and inflexible plants.  Flexible coal 
plants offer ramping rates of 4-8%/minute, 2-5-hour start-up times, and minimum output limits of 20-40% (of 
maximum), compared to inflexible plants with ramping rates of less than 4%/minute, 5-7-hour start-up times and 
minimum output limits of 40-60%.  Flexible natural gas plants show similar improvements, with minimum output 
limits of 15-30% compared to 40-50% for inflexible plants.  A “fast-acting” gas turbine plants on the market today can 
offer start-up times of just 40 minutes.  Flexible nuclear plants offer minimum output limits of 30-60%, compared to 
100% for inflexible plants.  In France, existing nuclear plants can ramp down to 30%, with ramp rates of up to 
1%/minute. 
In terms of flexibility, hydro plants, pumped storage plants, open cycle gas turbine, gas engines etc. are very suitable. 
Coal plants are classified as constant output or baseload plants and are rarely turned down or turned off frequently. 
Essentially, they are considered as inflexible.  These plants experience reduced efficiency, more maintenance, lower 
equipment lifetime and reduced cost etc. if subjected to cycling or frequent ramp up and ramp down. However, 
existing coal based plant can be redesigned/retrofitted to enable quick start-ups and ramping.   
In Denmark and Germany, thermal stations are extensively used for cycling as well as ramping. 
Combined-cycle natural gas power plants normally run as baseload plants or intermediary load plants.  While open 
cycle gas power plants are capable of cycling and ramping, combined-cycle natural gas power plants are also flexible 
to some extent and may be retrofitted to be more flexible.  These, however, will lead to some loss of generation 
efficiency, high maintenance cost and higher emissions. 
Nuclear power plants are considered to be the most inflexible of baseload plants.  But this plant can also be operated 
as a flexible plant, if designed properly.  In Germany and France, nuclear plants offer flexibility in operation. In India, 
the nuclear plants are operated as base load plants, with minimum variability from the point of consideration of safety 
and security. Also, with the rapid advancements in energy storage technology, in future if it becomes economically 
viable, then it can also prove to be a vital resource for providing balancing power.  
6.10.2 Transmission Strengthening 
Solar and wind map of India indicates that the potential of solar and wind power is concentrated mostly in few solar 
and wind rich States. In fact, 8 States in India accounts for more than 77% of the RE capacity addition by 2022. The 
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES                                                                                                                                                                
6.19 
Central Electricity Authority                                                                                                                                    National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
solar and wind power generated by these states may not be consumed fully by these states. Power generated from RES 
by these states needs to be transported to the load centers through transmission networks. This may require 
strengthening of existing grid networks or alternately the use of storage devices.   
 
In India, Green Energy Corridors for evacuation of power from the regions having high concentration of RES is in the 
process of implementation.   
6.10.3 Advanced Forecasting 
Wind and solar power forecasting can help reduce the uncertainty of variable renewable generation. Better 
forecasting helps grid operators to commit or de-commit generators in accommodating changes in wind and solar 
generation more efficiently and prepare for extreme events in which renewable generation is unusually high or low. 
Forecasts can help reduce the amount of fast response operating reserves needed for the system, thereby reducing 
costs of balancing the system.  
Internationally, improvements have been made in recent years towards reducing mean average forecast errors. Day-
ahead forecasts can be used to make day-ahead unit commitment decisions. This will drive operational efficiency and 
cost savings. Short-term forecasts can be used to determine the need for a quick-start generator, demand response, or 
other mitigating options and thus drive reliability. 
Clouds are the primary cause of variability for solar generation, aside from the predictable changes during the 
course of the day and throughout the year. The ability to accurately forecast solar power depends on the character of 
cloud cover, including the amount of water or ice in clouds and aerosols. To assess near-term impacts of 
approaching clouds on solar generation, sky imagers can be used. To predict impacts during the next few hours, 
satellite images can be used to assess the direction and speed of approaching clouds. For longer periods, weather 
models can be used to determine how clouds may form and change.  
In India, RES generators and system operators need to partner with IMD and ISRO for forecasting of weather and 
monitoring the cloud movement to improve forecast of power output from RES. 
6.10.4 Market Design 
Market design affects the quantity of flexible resources. The flexibility needs of the variable renewables may be 
addressed in a variety of ways including pricing, schedule/dispatch interval, ancillary service market and requirement, 
capacity market etc. Through proper market design, the roles of capacity market and ramping market, the roles of 
distributed generation, storage and demand response into wholesale and ancillary market, economic curtailment of 
renewables, resource aggregators etc. can be clearly spelt out. 
 6.10.5    Demand Response 
Demand side management measures encourage the customers to maximize the use of variable renewable energy 
sources while the supply is naturally high.  For example, when wind and solar PV are producing more than the 
demand, demand response can incentivize consumers to use more power during that time through appropriate price 
signals of low rates, thus helping shift the load and ensuring better utilization of generation resources.  The change in 
load may occur automatically in response to time of use or dynamic rates or due to the direct control by the grid 
operator or due to participation of demand response in wholesale, ancillary or capital market.  To have effective 
demand response, smart-grid technologies involving smart meters, communication and other methods are used.  
Electric vehicle “smart charging” is based on V2G and G2V concept where electric vehicle can become an integral 
part of the grid and are charged or discharged in response to external signals or dynamic prices. 
6.10.6 Grid Integration Cost 
Integration of variable RES involves two types of costs namely Grid Infrastructure Cost and System Operation 
Cost. Grid infrastructure costs include grid connection and grid upgrading costs.  
Grid connection costs include the cost of a new transmission line from the variable RES plant to the existing grid, 
which would be higher than those for a coal based plant, due to lower CUF.  This cost depends basically on the 
distance between the plant and the grid, the voltage level of the connection line, and the availability of standard 
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES                                                                                                                                                                
6.20 
Central Electricity Authority                                                                                                                                    National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
equipment.  The grid connection cost is an important economic constraint for renewables development in remote 
locations. However, these can be overcome to some extent by using energy storage devices, Phase Shift Transformers 
(PSTs) and FACTS devices. 
 
Grid upgrading costs include the cost of additional network equipment needed to strengthen the grid in order to 
integrate renewable power into the existing grids.  They depend mostly on the amount of renewable capacity, the 
location of the power plants and the structure of the existing grid. These costs can also be mitigating by using energy 
storage devices, Phase Shift Transformers (PSTs) and FACTS devices. 
System operation costs can be divided into system profile costs and short-term system balancing costs.  These 
account for the extra costs of the conventional part of the power system caused by the integration of variable 
renewable power. 
Profile costs is a broad concept that captures all three impacts of the temporal mismatch between VRE generation and 
load profile: 1) capacity costs (adequacy costs) due to a low VRE capacity credit; 2) reduced average utilization of 
thermal power plants; and 3) curtailed VRE generation to maintain grid security when power supply exceeds demand. 
Short-term system balancing costs:  Due to the variability and uncertainty properties of VRE generators, the reserve 
capacity needed for up-and down-regulation increases as compared to the case where the same energy is delivered by 
conventional generation. The increased requirements for reserve power lead to the extra costs for the conventional part 
of the power system.  These extra costs originate from the measures taken to ascertain increased reserve power, for 
example, by the operation of conventional plants at partial load, the start-up costs and contribution of conventional 
power plants with higher operating costs in the power system, increased wear-and-tear and maintenance costs of 
plants. 
6.11  
BALANCING RESERVES 
In a synchronous electrical system, the demand and supply of electricity must balance at every instant of time. Any 
imbalance is reflected in the variation of frequency. Therefore, in case of imbalance, the system is to be balanced by 
providing balancing power.  
Based on purpose, response time, and the way they are activated, balancing power can be categorized as Primary 
Control(PC), Secondary Control(SC) and Tertiary Control(TC).  
PC can be fully deployed within 30 seconds.  It is activated by locally measured frequency deviation.  PC can be 
classified as a fast, automatic, spinning reserve that is used to balance the synchronous system both up and 
downwards. 
SC has to be available within five minutes after activation.  It is activated automatically and centrally by System 
Operators.  SC is used to supplement PC for frequency restoration, and to re-balance the respective balancing area. SC 
can be supplied mainly by some hydro plants and gas based plants and to some extent by synchronized thermal 
generators.  Hence, it is an automatic reserve that balances both the synchronous system and the balancing area up and 
down. To a large extent, it is a spinning reserve.   
TC is used to replace SC over time.  It is either directly activated or in schedules of 15 minutes. Activation is a manual 
decision usually based on current and expected deployment of SC.  TC is mostly supplied by stand-by thermal 
generators.   
The concept of Balancing power has assumed a great significance nowadays with the infusion of Variable Renewable 
Energy(VRE) into the system. VRE generators are weather dependent and are, as such, inherently stochastic in nature. 
There would be deviation between actual generation and forecast generation from the VRE generators. This deviation 
may be positive or negative. In case of positive deviation, balancing power needs to be pressed into service. In case of 
negative deviation, backing down of generation takes place or alternatively through absorption of extra power by 
energy storage devices.

While carrying out balancing, the concept of balancing area and synchronous system are used. In India, the 
synchronous system is the entire integrated grid comprising of the five regions and Bhutan. Balancing area is a 
geographical subset of the synchronous system where imbalance occurs. So the balancing area may be a state or a 
region. In the event of an imbalance, the target set point for the synchronous system is the frequency. That is the 
system frequency is to be brought to their normal value. However, the target set point for the balancing area is to bring 
the net deviation between balancing area and the rest of the synchronous system to ZERO from schedule. 
 
At present system operators in India (SLDCs and RLDCs) are playing an active role in balancing the system.  
Internationally, the developed countries have adopted the integrated approach, involving system operator, balance 
responsible parties, supplier of balancing power and regulators. All of these play the role of the system operator and 
market operators. In India, the market operation is performed mainly by the power exchanges. They must work in 
tandem for implementing and effective balancing system.  The role of the different entities in the integrated approach 
are described below:  
Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) or ‘program responsible parties’ are market entities that have the responsibility 
of balancing a portfolio of generators and/or loads.  BRPs can be utilities, and industrial consumers, etc.  They deliver 
binding schedules to system operators for each quarter-hour of the next day, and are financially accountable for 
deviations from these schedules. 
System operators activate balancing power to physically balance demand and supply if the sum of BRP imbalances is 
non-zero.  Specifically, system operators have four obligations: 
1.  determine the amount of capacity that has to be reserved for balancing, ex ante 
2.  acquire the required balancing power reserves and determine the price paid for capacity and energy, ex ante 
3.  activate balancing power in moments of physical imbalance, real time 
4.  determine the imbalance price, and clear the system financially, ex post. 
 
Suppliers of balancing power reserve the supply capacity, and deliver energy once activated by the system operator.  
They are obliged to deliver energy under pre-specified terms, for example, within a certain time frame and with certain 
ramp rates.  Suppliers are traditionally mostly generators, but can also be consumers.  Typically, payments received by 
the suppliers of balancing power have two components: capacity payment because capacity reservation occasions 
opportunity costs, and/or energy payment. 
A system is said to be “actively balanced” when the system operators deploy balancing power.  The price paid for this 
service is the capacity and the energy payment for balancing power.  Similarly, if the Balance Responsible 
Parties(BRP) takes the price signal and balance the system, it is said to be “passively balanced”.  Hence, system 
operators can either actively balance the system ordering adjustments via contracted balancing power, or passively 
balance the system via sending imbalance price signals to BRPs. This is also called ‘self-balancing’. The time scale of 
passive balancing can be of several minutes.  Hence, it cannot replace balancing power required to respond to 
stochastic disturbances. 
Determining the balancing reserve is a challenge under high VRE infusion scenario. There is no unique acceptable 
methodology for this. Nowadays, instead of deterministic approach, stochastic approach is widely utilized. From the 
historical data, the forecast errors for wind and solar generations are found out. The errors are assumed to be normally 
distributed. Taking a confidence limit of 95 or 99%, the reserve requirements are estimated.  
6.12 CONCLUSIONS 
India  has  achieved  a  total  installed  capacity  of  57,244.24  MW  from  Renewable  Energy  Sources  as  on  31st 
March,2017.

  The country has set its Renewable Energy capacity addition target to 175 GW by 2022 in view of the significant 
renewable energy potential in the country. To achieve this, some portion of land within the power stations can be 
utilized for installation of solar PV power generation projects. 
  Accelerated development of RES requires adequate indigenous manufacturing facility for RES related equipment. 
Policy framework may be developed to encourage setting up of RES related equipment manufacturing facility in the 
country  This  would  be  consistent  with  the  Government  of  India’s  “Make  in  India”  policy.  Further,  indigenous 
technologies (renewable as well as energy efficient technologies) should be given preference in procurement. 
 Preparation of biomass atlas is required.   
 
 
  Adequate incentive mechanism may be provided for the SPV installation both for the new houses as well as old 
houses/buildings. 
  Repowering of existing wind power projects under the existing “Policy for Repowering of Wind Power Projects” 
may be encouraged along with new wind power projects to obtain more generation from the same location as well 
as a higher CUF.

CHAPTER 7 
HYDRO POWER IN INDIA 
 
7.0 INTRODUCTION  
India has considerable hydro power potential, which being a renewable source of energy can play a key role in reducing 
the carbon footprint of the Indian power sector and efforts are being set afoot in this direction. A Hydro Electric Project 
has a long useful life extending to well over 50 years and helps in conserving scarce fossil fuels. Development of hydro 
projects  is  important  to  meet  the  objective  of  sustainable  development  and  for  energy  security  of  the  country. 
Development of hydro power projects also provides the added advantage of opening up avenues for development of 
remote and backward regions of the country. Hydro power stations have the inherent ability for instantaneous starting, 
stopping  and  managing  load  variability  which  helps  in  improving  reliability  of  the  power  system.    Hydro  Electric 
Projects are ideal for meeting the peak requirement and the balancing requirement arising due to variability of renewable 
energy sources. 
 
   
7.1. HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER POTENTIAL AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
7.1.1  Hydro-Electric Potential  
An assessment was made of the hydro-electric potential in the country by CEA in the year 1987, based on observed 
basic data on topographic features of river basins, discharge characteristics of rivers at a large number of sites, geological 
and other information. According to the assessment, the total Hydro Electric Power potential in the country was assessed 
as 84,044 MW (at 60% load factor) from a total of 845 number of identified H.E. Schemes which when fully developed 
would result in an installed capacity of about 1,48,701 MW on the basis of probable average load factor. The total hydro 
energy potential is assessed as 600 billion units per year. The Great Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra rivers with 
their innumerable tributaries originating from the Himalayas constitute about 70% of the country's assessed hydropower 
potential. In addition, the assessment studies have also identified 63 sites for Pumped Storage Schemes (PSS) with total 
installation of about 96,000 MW.  In addition to above, a sizable potential was identified by CEA for development of 
micro, mini and small hydro schemes on rivulets and canal drops. 1,512 no. of small hydro-electric schemes having 
aggregate installed capacity of above 6,782 MW on canal falls/rivers have been identified. The matter relating to H.E. 
Projects up to 25 MW is being looked after by MNRE and the potential of small H.E. Projects has been assessed by 
MNRE as 19,749 MW. 
 
As on 31st March,2017, Hydro Electric Schemes (above 25 MW capacity) have a total installed capacity of 44,478 MW 
including Pumped storage schemes (PSS) capacity of 4,785 MW. The hydro schemes under construction, account to 
capacity of 10848.5 MW (excluding PSS of 1,080 MW). Hydro Electric schemes totaling to capacity of 25,160 MW are 
concurred by CEA and yet to be taken up for construction, schemes totaling to 6,414 MW are under examination in 
CEA, DPRs of capacity totaling to 8,094 MW has been appraised but returned for resubmission, schemes totaling to 
6,327 MW are under study and investigation(S&I) and schemes totaling to 13,857 MW on which Study & Investigation 
is held up or yet to be taken up. Summary of the status of Hydro Electric Potential development in the country is indicated 
in Tables 7.1.

7.1.2 
Share of Hydro-electric Installed Capacity & Generation 
 
A small Hydro-Electric Plant (130 kW) established near Darjeeling, West Bengal in 1897 ushered the beginning of 
hydro-electric power development in the country. Since then, development of hydro-electric power in the country 
has made rapid strides. The hydro installed capacity which was only 508 MW in 1947 with 12 no. of HEP (51 units), 
with maximum unit size of 22 MW at Bhira  HEP  of Tata Power,  has  risen  to 44,478.5 MW as on 31st March,2017 
from Hydro Electric stations above 25  MW  capacity. Conventional Hydro Electric Stations of run-of-river type, 
single purpose hydroelectric stations with storage, multipurpose projects as well as pumped storage projects have 
been  executed  throughout  the  country.  The  maximum  unit  size  is  now  250  MW  at  Koyna  Stage-IV  of 
MAHAGENCO, Nathpa Jhakri of SJVNL, Tehri of THDC and Karcham Wangtoo of JPVL. 
The  installed  capacity  of  Hydro-Electric  Stations  vis-à-vis  total  capacity,  the  contribution in  generation  by 
hydro  plants  and  trend  of  hydro  capacity  &  generation  over  the years  are  indicated  in  Table-7.4  and  at 
Exhibit  7.2. From  Table  7.4,  it  may be  observed  that  the  overall  share  of  hydro  in  terms  of  installed 
capacity  in  the  country has risen from 37.30% at the end of 1947 to 50.61% during 1962-63 and thereafter 
declined to 13.6% at the end of 2016-17. The generation from hydro stations during the year 2016-17, accounts 
for 10.59% of the total energy generation in the country. Region wise summary of hydro Installed capacity are 
indicated in Table 7.5. 
 
 
Sector  wise  contribution  of  hydro  generation during the year 2016-17 in  Central, State and Private sectors 
were 47.3%, 42.0%  and 10.7%  respectively while sector-wise distribution  of  hydro  installed capacity as on 
31 s t  March,2017  in  Central,  State  and Private  Sectors  is  26.2%,  6 6 . 7 %  and  7 . 1 %  respectively. These 
details are illustrated in Exhibit 7.3.

 HYDRO POWER – A FLEXIBLE SOLUTION  
 
The power system operation stability requires the system to minimise fluctuations between demand and supply. This 
encompasses,  for  example,  short  term  reserves  (generation,  storage,  demand  response)  to  cover  potential  incidents, 
which  decrease  power  supply  to  the  system,  or  to  respond  to  short-term  variations  in  demand  and  generation. 
Hydropower therefore provides an ideal solution for the challenges of a transitioning power system. 
 
Hydropower brings a strong contribution to flexibility in the power system today filling the gap between supply and 
demand that has been induced by the non-dispatchable variability of RES. The storage capabilities of many hydropower 
plants  make  them  a  perfect  instrument  for  optimising  the  use  of  variable  RES  over  shorter  and  longer  periods. 
Hydropower also provides a number of ancillary services which are needed in order to manage a transmission system in 
a way that secures system stability and security of supply. Moreover, during power system restoration, such as in the 
case of an extreme event (e.g. blackout), auxiliary loads of conventional thermal and nuclear power plants need external 
power source, which can be provided quickly by hydropower.  
 
Hydropower plants with reservoirs reduce the dependency on the variability of the natural inflow and enable adjustments 
of power generation to the variability in demand. These plants are operated on a scheduled basis taking into account 
data regarding water flow forecast and consumption patterns. They are commonly used for intense load following and 
to meet peak demand. The generation of peak-load energy from reservoir type hydropower plants allows the optimisation 
of base-load power generation from other less flexible electricity sources, such as nuclear and thermal power plants. 
Besides contributing to water management activities (flood control, irrigation, drinking water, etc.), hydropower plants 
with reservoirs also introduce unique benefits to the electricity system. There are different types of hydropower plants 
with reservoirs.  
 
Storage hydro plant (or conventional reservoir-type hydropower plant) takes advantage of large reservoirs with natural 
inflow of water and the possibility to reduce or increase the water outflow instantaneously. The water is stored in the 
reservoir and no pumps are needed. Pumped storage power plants store energy by pumping water from a lower to a 
higher reservoir and converting the potential energy back into electricity. These reservoirs can be natural or artificial. 
Both types of pumped storage plants enable the power system to receive and store energy in periods of low demand or 
excessive generation, and generate electricity in times of higher demand. The role of pumped storage hydropower plants 
is twofold: they balance the grid for demand-driven fluctuations, and balance generation-driven fluctuations. Storage 
possibilities  combined  with  the  instant  start  and  stop  of  generation  make  hydropower  plants  very  flexible.  Pumped 
storage and storage hydro with peak generation are able to cope with high generation-driven fluctuations and can provide 
active power within a short period of time. 
 
Conventional reservoir-type hydropower plants and pumped storage power plants can provide the full range of grid-
stabilising services in view of their ability to follow demand or generation fluctuations within only a few minutes. There 
are  several  different  ancillary  services  or  grid  stabilising  services  of  hydropower,  thus  facilitating  the  integration  of 
variable RES into the power system and providing a key tool to maintain a stable and balanced grid:

• Back-up and reserve: hydropower plants have the ability to enter load into an electrical system from a source that is 
not  on-line.  Hydropower  can  provide  this  service  while  not  consuming  additional  fuel,  thereby  ensuring  minimal 
emissions.  
 
 
• Quick-start capability: hydropower`s quick-start capability takes just a few minutes.  
 
• Black start capability: hydropower plants have the capability to run at a zero load. When loads increase, additional 
power can be delivered rapidly to the system in order to meet demand.  
 
• Regulation and frequency response:  hydro plants contribute towards maintaining the frequency  within the given 
margins through continuous modulation of active power and to address moment-to moment fluctuations in system power 
requirements. Hydropower`s fast response ability makes it especially valuable in covering steep load gradients (ramp 
rates) through its fast load-following.  
 
• Voltage support: hydropower plants have the ability to control reactive power, thereby ensuring that power will flow 
from  generation  to  load.  They  also  contribute  to  maintain  voltage  by  injecting  or  absorbing  reactive  power  to  the 
system/Grid. 
 
• Spinning reserve: hydropower supports the dynamic behaviour of the grid operation. Hydropower plants can provide 
spinning reserve – additional power supply that can be made available to the transmission system within a few seconds 
in case of unexpected load changes in the grid.  
 
Hydropower plants with a small reservoir are sometimes also called pondage plants. These are designed to modulate 
generation on a daily or weekly basis. Pondage plants can provide flexibility services mainly through balancing power. 
They also provide frequency and voltage control as ancillary services. 
 
Run-of-river hydro plants have little or no storage capacity. They therefore offer short-term storage possibilities (few 
minutes’  dynamic  cycle),  thus  allowing  for  some  adaptation  to  demand,  especially  for  ancillary  services,  such  as 
frequency and voltage control. 
 
 To sum up, flexibility solutions of hydropower include: 
 
 
accommodating large variations in residual demand (to counter variability of RES, as sun does not always shine 
and wind does not blow constantly),  
 
 
providing increasing ramp rates in real time, caused by sudden changes of generation 
 
 
offsetting unexpected variations in production due to forecast errors in the intra-day markets or in the form of 
balancing power or ancillary services. 
 
The hydro capacity of 44,479 MW (as on 31st March,2017) consist of 3611.67 MW Run of River(RoR); 15,139 MW 
RoR with pondage; 20,942 MW storage type includes 4785.6 MW of pump storage type. The region wise types of hydro 
are detailed in Table 7.6.

PUMPED STORAGE PLANTS – BEST FRIEND OF ELECTRICITY GRID 
 
While many forms of energy storage systems have been installed globally, Pumped Storage Plants (PSP) are playing an 
increasingly important role in providing peaking power and maintaining system stability in the power system of many 
countries.  Pumped  storage  technology  is  the  long  term  technically  proven,  cost  effective,  highly  efficient  and 
operationally flexible way of energy storage on a large scale to store intermittent and variant energy generated by solar 
and wind.   
 
PSPs improve overall economy of power system operation, increase capacity utilization of thermal stations and reduce 
operational problems of thermal stations during light load period. The other advantages of pumped storage development 
are availability of spinning reserve at almost no cost to the system and regulating frequency to meet sudden load changes 
in the network. PSPs have the ability to provide ancillary benefits such as flexible capacity, voltage support and Black- 
start facility etc. Pumped storage technology has advanced significantly since its original introduction and now includes 
adjustable speed pumped turbines which can quickly shift from motor, to generator, to synchronous condenser modes, 
for easier and more flexible operation of the Grid. 
 
Out of 96,524 MW of pumped storage potential  identified in India by CEA at 63 sites, at present 9 pumped storage 
schemes with aggregate installed capacity of 4,786 MW are in operation out of which only 5 Nos. plants with aggregate 
installed capacity of 2,600 MW are being operated in pumping mode. The remaining 4 Nos. plants with an installed 
capacity  of  about  2,200  MW  are  not  operating  in  pumping  mode  mainly  because  the  2nd  reservoir  is  either  under 
construction or the same has not been constructed. Efforts should be made to complete and operationalize the pump 
storage projects not running in PSP mode by resolving the issues. A PSP operation of a typical day is shown in Exhibit 
7.5.

Since the energy gained from Pumped Storage Plants (PSP) is less than the energy input, it is necessary that off-peak 
power to be used as input may be available at reasonable tariff for making the Pumped Storage Plants commercially 
viable.  An  analysis  of  the  Market  Clearing  Price  (MCP)  in  the  Peak  and  Off-Peak  hours  in  the  Power  Exchange  is

If a PSP pumps for 7 hours in a day, then, it can generate for 5.25 hours assuming 75% overall efficiency. It is seen, 
from the above analysis, that as long as the price for 5.25 hours is more than (7/5.25 ~ 1.33) times the pumping price, it 
implies payment for only fixed costs of pumped storage. If the overall efficiency improves to 80%, the need for price 
differential in peak hours reduces to 25%.

In view of infusion of high RES, Pump Storage Development has to be treated as a separate category. Separate Policy 
instrument is required to incentivize PSPs. The pumped storage capacity was assessed by CEA in 1987, since then there 
have been many changes in environment laws & technology which calls for re-assessment of the potential.  
 
 
In India, with increased penetration of RES in the grid, present practice of real time imbalance management may not be 
sufficient for handling large scale uncertainty  in  RES and limit the integration of renewable energy  generation. The 
transmission corridors for evacuation of renewable  power is being  firmed up  for the plan of having 175 GW of RE 
power in next 5 years, it is imperative to develop more PSPs and the benefits being given to RE projects may also be 
extended to the PSPs. The development of pumped storage particularly in the areas with concentrated wind and solar 
generation would significantly improve the grid reliability and it would act as the best partner for the Renewable Energy 
integration.  
 
While  benefits  of  having  pumped  storage  hydro  power  are  known  but  current  market  structures  and  regulatory 
frameworks do not present an effective means of achieving this goal.  There is need for regulatory mechanism/ market 
incentives  for  effective  integration  of  new  generation,  energy  storage  and  transmission  or  that  makes  the  PSP  a 
commercially viable proposition. Regulatory Commissions may incentivize Tariff for PSPs and financial institutions 
should consider providing attractive terms for financing of PSPs.  
 
7.4 
IMPORTANCE OF HYDRO IN PRESENT SCENARIO 
 
The  current  development  profile  and  trends  in  generation  capacity  addition  in  India  have  resulted  in  the  following 
aspects:  
 
• Skewed development pattern between different generation technologies: The current portfolio of installed capacity of 
3,26,832.5 MW as on 31.03.2017 is dominated by thermal power with around 66.8% share. Hydro, with an installed 
capacity  of  44,478.5  MW  has  a  share  of  around  13.6%.  Adequate  diversity  in  generation  asset  base  has  not  been 
maintained with growth in hydro assets not being concomitant with growth in the thermal asset base. This also impacts 
the long-term least cost development pattern with over reliance on 25-year thermal plants vis- à-vis more than 40-year 
hydro assets.  
 
• Inadequate peaking and quick response capability: While regional grids have been integrated and frequency regimes 
have been streamlined, the country faces lack of assets capable of meeting peaking deficits and with quick response 
characteristics. For meeting peak requirement and to mitigate the  variability due  to renewable energy sources of the 
order of 175 GW by 2022 and in the shortage of gas, the peak and the balancing requirement is to be primarily met by 
Hydro Electric Projects. 
 
•  Sustainable  low  carbon  development:  While  India  is  considering  a  low  carbon  strategy  and  actively  considering 
focusing on Energy Efficient  Renovation  & Modernization to utilise existing assets, the low carbon strategy can be 
fostered further with a higher thrust on green capacity additions via hydropower development. These factors necessitate 
renewed  emphasis  on  ’responsible  hydropower  development’  to  promote  economic  growth.  Hydro’s  critical  role  in 
sustainable development and energy security for the country is based on the elements of sustainability, availability and 
affordability. 
 
7.5 
CURRENT ISSUES AND CHALLENGES 
 
Development  of  hydro power  projects is fraught with  a  number  of  uncertainties.  Broadly,  the problems  faced  by 
developers  can  be  grouped into  those  related  to  the  project  location,  to  its geology,  and  to  issues  of  resettlement 
and rehabilitation.  Typically, hydro projects  are high cost,  long  gestation  projects  and  are  highly vulnerable to any 
uncertainties.   
 
1) 
Land Acquisition Issues 
Land  availability  and  acquisition  are  among  the  core  structural  issues  that  impact  almost  all  infrastructure 
sectors. Problems arising in the acquisition of land for hydropower projects are causing suspension and delay 
in construction activities. 
   
 HYDRO POWER IN INDIA                                                                                                                                                                
7.13 
Central Electricity Authority                                                                                                                                    National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
2) 
Environment and Forest issues 
Hydropower projects often require  forest areas  for their  implementation and compensatory afforestation on 
non-forest  lands.  Progress  of  many  projects  has  been  affected  on  account  of  delay  and  non-clearance  on 
environment and forest aspects. Construction and operation of hydropower dams can significantly affect natural 
river systems as well as fish and wildlife populations. 
 
 
3) 
Rehabilitation & Resettlement Issues 
Hydropower projects involve submergence causing the displacement of project area people. The rehabilitation 
of  project  affected  people  is  also  a  major  issue  which  is  more  pronounced  in  the  case  of  storage-based 
hydropower projects. 
 
4) 
Enabling infrastructure 
A number of hydropower projects are located in remote sites in States which do not have adequate demand for 
electricity.  This  creates  the  requirement  for  developing  enabling  infrastructure  for  power  evacuation.  The 
’chicken  neck’  presents  geographical  constraints  in  developing  requisite  transmission  infrastructure  for 
hydropower evacuation from the north east. There are certain other challenges for the coordinated development 
of  the  transmission  network,  e.g.  identifying  beneficiaries  well  in  advance,  developing  excess  evacuation 
capacity keeping in mind the future development of projects (especially where there are Right of Way (RoW) 
issues). Furthermore, the Plant Load Factor (PLF) for hydropower projects is typically less than 50%, as a result 
of which significant transmission capacity is under-utilised. All these result in higher transmission costs.  
 
Hydropower projects also require the development of associated infrastructure such as roads and bridges in the 
area.  Inclusion  of  the  cost  of  development  of  such  associated  infrastructure  increases  the  cost  of  power 
generated affecting project viability and sustainability. Lack of infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and 
difficult access to sites often become blocks to moving skilled manpower to difficult project sites. 
 
5) 
Law & Order / Local issues  
Protests by the local people against the construction activities like blasting, muck disposal etc. and demands 
for employment, extra compensation etc. often create law and order problems which delays the commencement 
and affects progress of the works. 
 
6) 
Technical challenges  
Techno  economic  viability  of  hydropower  projects  depends  on  the  geology,  topography,  hydrology  and 
accessibility  of  the  project  site.  Even  if  extensive  investigations  using  State-of  the-art  investigation  and 
construction techniques are adopted, an element of uncertainty remains in the sub-surface geology. Geological 
surprises during actual construction cannot be ruled out. This unpredictable geology is more pronounced in the 
young fold Himalayas where most of the Indian hydropower potential resides. Such technical challenges add 
to construction risks.  
7) 
Natural Calamities 
Natural calamities like unprecedented rain / flash floods, cloud burst, earthquake etc delay the completion of 
project. 
 
8) 
Inter-State Issues 
Planning  for  hydropower  development  in  India  has  generally  been  oriented  toward  individual  projects. 
However, this approach has several limitations for sustainable development of an entire river basin. Inter-State 
disputes are another aspect which hinders integrated river basin development for hydropower projects. A large 
number of hydropower projects with common river systems between adjoining States are held up due to a lack 
of inter-State agreements and disputes on water-sharing.  
 
9) 
Tariff Design for Hydro 
 
 HYDRO POWER IN INDIA                                                                                                                                                                
7.14 
Central Electricity Authority                                                                                                                                    National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
Tariffs remaining static for the entire life time of the hydro project doesn’t send the right signal as far as hydro dispatch 
is concerned. The tariff design therefore needs to reflect the current capital cost and value of the hydro energy with the 
gains split between the power plant and its beneficiaries as decided by the Appropriate Commission. 
 
 
There is need for all hydro power to have a two-part tariff comprising of a fixed cost and variable cost. Conventionally, 
the variable cost of hydro power stations is considered as NIL; so a hybrid tariff model is required for all hydro power 
stations similar to that prevailing for the power stations whose tariff is decided by the Central Electricity Regulatory 
Commission (CERC). Currently, the Annual Fixed Charges (AFC) of such power plants is divided equally into Fixed 
Charge and Energy Charge with the latter apportioned amongst the saleable Design Energy (DE) for the whole year.  
 
The DE figures should be available both on ten daily basis as well as monthly basis for 50% and 90% dependable years 
and these figures should be available on public domain. Policy needs to promote coordination between IMD and CWC 
for creating infrastructure for inflow forecasting and precipitation forecasting in the catchment area of a river basin. 
 
10) 
Non-availability of Grid power during initial stage 
 
During construction stage the grid power supply is generally not available at construction site. Hence the construction 
power is being fed through the DG sets the supply to diesel to such remote location takes huge time which delays the 
commencement and effect progress of the work.  
11) 
Safety and security problem 
 
Most of the untapped hydro projects of the country are in remote and border areas like J&K, Arunachal Pradesh etc. 
disturbance from locals and security threats in border area is being faced. 
 
7.6 
POLICY INITIATIVES TAKEN FOR INCREASING THE HYDRO CAPACITY  
 
The  Government  has  taken  several  policy  initiatives/measures  to  tap  the  hydro  potential  and  to  boost  hydro  power 
development in the country. The details are given below:

CPSUs/ Project developers, etc. to sort out the critical issues. 
  Review meetings are taken by MoP/ CEA with Border Road Organization, Ministry of Road Transport and 
Highways etc. to sort out the infrastructure issues.  
 
 
7.7. 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
  Most hydro facilities have the ability to manage net-load variability and uncertainty. Hydro plants would be 
able to provide a more valued service to the grid than the manner in which they have historically been used , in 
view of high penetration of solar and wind energy. 
 
  Hydro plants shall be considered for compensation for balancing the grid by implementing differential tariff 
for  peak  and  off-peak  power.  Pumped  storage  plants  should  be  encouraged  to  operate  in  pump  mode  by 
providing incentive for its operation. 
 
 
Infrastructure cost from the Hydro project may be excluded for determining tariff. As the need for generation 
resources that can provide system flexibility increases with an increased proportional penetration of variable 
renewables, the value of hydropower and pumped storage will become more significant. 
 
  At Present, Central Financial Assistance/ Support in the form of grant/ assistance/ subsidy is being provided by 
the Govt. to the renewable small Hydro Projects up to 25MW capacity. Extension of this Financial Assistance/ 
Support to all hydro projects (irrespective of the size/ capacity) is likely to give a boost to the development of 
hydro power in the country.

CHAPTER 8 
GAS BASED POWER PLANTS 
8.0 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Natural Gas is one of the cleanest fuels with less carbon dioxide per joule delivered than either by coal or oil and contains 
far fewer pollutants than other hydrocarbon fuels and therefore the Natural gas has emerged as the most preferred fuel 
due  to  its  inherent  environmentally  benign  nature,  easy  transportability,  ease  of  use,  greater  efficiency  and  cost 
effectiveness. The development of Natural Gas industry in the country started in 1960s with discovery of gas fields in 
Assam and Gujarat. After discovery of South Basin fields by ONGC in 1970s, Natural Gas assumed importance. The 
Exploration  activities  in  India  were  earlier  carried  out  only  by  the  National  Oil  Companies  (ONGC  &  OIL)  under 
nomination  regime.  Later  private  companies  were  allowed  to  enter  into  exploration  through  JV  with  National  Oil 
Companies  (NOCs)  under  Pre-NELP  (New  Exploration  Licensing  Policy  )  regime.  Subsequently,  100%  foreign 
participation in exploration was allowed in the current NELP regime. Later discoveries were made in Gujarat, Krishna 
Godavari (KG) basin, Cauvery basin, Tripura, Assam etc.  Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) is 
introduced in March, 2016 for a uniform licensing system to cover all hydrocarbons such as oil, gas, coal bed methane 
etc. under a single licensing framework coupled with open acreage policy. 
 
The demand of natural gas has sharply increased in the last two decades at the global level. In India, the natural gas 
sector  has  gained  importance,  particularly  over  the  last  decade.  However,  the  supply  is  not  keeping  pace  with  the 
demand. There is shortage of natural gas for the fertilizer plants, power plants and petrochemical complexes. The power 
and fertilizer industries emerged as the key demand drivers for natural gas due to the scale of their operations, policy 
intervention and social impact. In an agrarian economy such as India, the priority has been the production of fertilizers.  
  
8.1 
BACKGROUND 
 
In India, Natural gas produced from domestic sources is being allocated to different sectors by Central Government as 
per policy guidelines issued from time to time. In case of imported gas, the marketers are free to import Re-gasified 
Liquid Natural Gas (RLNG) and sell the RLNG to customers.  
 
Gas based generation in India got the impetus when HVJ (Hajira- Vijaypur-Jagdishpur) gas pipeline was commissioned 
by GAIL in the 80's after discovery of gas in the west coast of India. This led to commissioning of a number of Gas 
based Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) along the HVJ pipe line in the Western and Northern part of India. Prior 
to that, very little gas based generation was present in the North East.  Apart from the major HVJ trunk pipeline, certain 
regional gas grids like in KG basin and Kaveri basin also helped in development of some gas based power generation 
capacities.  Isolated fields are located mainly in parts of Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and North-Eastern Region.  
 
With the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), gas exploration in India got an impetus and the discovery of gas 
in Krishna Godavari Dhirubhai 6 (KGD6) field by Reliance Industries Limited in 2002, was expected to be a turning 
point in gas production in the country. With the commissioning of East West pipeline by Reliance Gas Infrastructure 
India Limited, KGD6 gas got infused into the system in early 2009. 
 
With the commencement of production from KGD6 field and the expectation of considerable increase in the volume of 
production from this field, number of gas based plants were taken up for implementation in the country even without 
firm allocation of gas. The peak flow of the gas in KGD6 fields was expected to be about 80 MMSCMD, by the end of 
the year 2009, and was to increase further in subsequent years. Before the commencement of production from KGD6 
fields, gas based power plants were operating primarily with the allocated Administrative Price Mechanism(APM) /Non 
APM/Panna-Mukta-Tapi- Ravva basin gas from nominated fields, but these supplies were short of their requirement.  
When  KGD6  gas  production  was  about  to  start  in  2009,  Empowered  Group  of  Ministers  (EGoM)  on  pricing  and 
utilization  for  natural  gas  under  New  Exploration  and  Licensing  Programme  (NELP)  made  allocation  of  63.17 
MMSCMD  of  KGD6  gas  to  power  sector  in  May  2008  and  October 2009.   The  EGoM  in  its  meeting  held  on  23 rd 
August,2013 decided that the entire additional NELP gas production, available during the years 2013-14, 2014-15 & 
2015-16 after meeting the supply level of 31.5 MMSCMD to fertilizer sector, be supplied to the power sector. 
 
Supply of KGD6 gas was started in 2009-10 with 39.67 MMSCMD and reached a peak of 55.35 MMSCMD in 2010-
11. The gas from KGD6 started gradually declining to 42.33 MMSCMD in 2011-12 ,25.74 MMSCMD in 2012-13 and 
only 14 MMSCMD in June, 2013. Contrary to the projections, the gradual reduction in production from KGD6 upset

the gas based capacity addition programme in the country. When the production from KGD6 field fell to 16 MMSCMD 
in March, 2013, the supplies to power sector got reduced to zero.

8.2 PRESENT STATUS 
 
Out of total installed capacity of 3,26,833 MW as on 31st March,2017, a capacity of 25,330 MW (about 7.75%) is from 
gas  based  power  plants.  However,  capacity  of  24,037MW  is  being  monitored  by  CEA.  Out  of  the  total  monitored 
capacity, a capacity of 21,048 MW is connected with Main Pipeline/Gas grid and 2989 MW is connected with isolated 
gas fields. Of the grid connected gas based capacity of 21,048 MW, 8,042 MW is predominantly APM gas based and 
6,897 MW is predominantly on KG D6 gas. Besides this a capacity of 6,110 MW has been commissioned without any 
gas allocation. In addition, a capacity of 406 MW is under construction and is likely to be commissioned by 2021-22.   
 
Normative Gas requirement to operate the existing Power plants of capacity of 24,037 MW at 90% Plant Load Factor 
(PLF) is about 117 MMSCMD. However, the total domestic gas allocated to power projects is 87.05 MMSCMD and 
average gas supplied to these gas based power plants during the year 2016-17 was only 29.59 MMSCMD. The gas grid 
connected capacity had received 20.22 MMSCMD gas during the year 2016-17 and achieved average PLF of around 
19% only and gas based capacity connected with isolated gas field had received 9.37 MMSCMD gas and achieved a 
PLF of 50.43 %. Therefore, the average Plant Load Factor of gas based generation capacity in the country during 2016-
17 is about 22.86%.  
 
Details of gas based capacity with gas supply position for the year 2016-17 is given in Annexure 8.1. Supply of Natural 
gas to gas based power plants during last few years is shown in Table 8.2.

Average Gas Supplied (MMSCMD)
 
 
 
As  can  be  seen  from  the  Exhibit  8.1,  domestic  gas  supply  to  gas  based  power  plants  had  reached  a  peak  of  59.31 
MMSCMD during 2010-11, thereafter, due to unprecedented reduction in gas supply, the gas supply to gas based power 
plants  had  reduced  sharply.  During  the  year  2016-17,  total  gas  supplied  to  gas  based  power  plants  was  only  29.59 
MMSCMD, which is even less than gas supply during 2007-08. 
 
Average PLF of gas based capacity for the last few years is shown in Exhibit 8.2. It can be seen from Exhibit 8.2 that 
average PLF of gas based capacity during 2007-08 was around 55% and had increased to 67% in the  year 2009-10, 
thereafter average PLF started declining and for the year 2016-17 (Apr-Dec,2016) average PLF came down to around 
22% only.

ADVANTAGES OF GAS BASED POWER PLANTS 
 
Natural gas based power generation has many advantages over other conventional energy sources mainly on account of 
its  lesser  impact  on  the  environment  and  better  economics.  However,  despite  these  advantages,  due  to  shortage  of 
domestic gas, India’s energy mix is skewed towards coal compared to other countries, with gas based power share in 
India only 8% against the world average of around 22%1.   
 
Gas based power plants require significantly less land and water in comparison to coal based power plant of the same 
capacity. In addition, gas based plants with quick ramping can support the renewable balancing power requirements. 
This gains importance especially in the context of India’s aspiration to rapidly scale up renewable generation. Besides, 
gas based capacity will minimize the need for other alternative modes of power generation during peak hours of power 
shortage such as using diesel generators etc., which are not only costlier but also result in more environmental pollution. 
It  may also be noted that  gas based power  generation  would reduce carbon emissions, as emissions  from gas based 
power generation is less as compared to Diesel or coal based generation. Details are shown in the Table 8.3.

However, due to acute shortage of domestic gas and higher price of imported natural gas, gas based power plants are 
not in a position to run their plants efficiently. 
 
CAPACITY ADDITION DURING 2017-22 AND GAS REQUIREMENT 
8.4 
In view of the shortage of gas, Ministry of Power had issued an advisory in March, 2012 for the developers not to plan 
power projects based on domestic gas till 2015-16, as projections for 2014-15 and 2015-16 given by MoP & NG could 
not support any new capacity.

Due to uncertainty in availability of domestic gas, though there was a capacity of about 3,500 MW are at advanced stage 
of construction, only a capacity of 406 MW is likely to be commissioned during the period 2017-22.  
 
 
8.5 GAS BASED POWER PLANTS AS PEAKING PLANTS 
 
Government of India has chalked out a program of massive capacity addition from RES by 2022. The total RES capacity 
by March, 2022 is planned to be 175 GW. The generation from RES shall be treated as must-run. Therefore, at any 
instant, the net system demand after absorbing the generation from RES (i.e. Net Demand = Total Demand -generation 
from RES) needs to be met through conventional generation sources. The solar generation would be maximum during 
the day time when the system demand is quite low and would be “NIL” during evening peak hours. This would make 
the Net Demand Curve   very steep and would require generation from conventional sources which can ramp up very 
fast. This necessitates dedicated peaking plants.   
 
Further, infusion of significant quantum of RES into the grid will also need availability of adequate balancing power to 
take care of the variability and uncertainty associated with RES generation. Balancing requirement as well as ramping 
requirement of the grid can be sourced in order of priority from Hydro plants, Pumped Storage Plants and Open Cycle 
Gas Turbine Plants followed by Closed Cycle Gas Turbine Plants. Now, out of the total hydro capacity of  44,478.42 
MW as on 31st March,2017, 25,727.75 MW are storage type, 3611.67 MW are run-of the river type and 15,139 MW 
are run-of the river with pondage type. Irrigational requirement, failure of monsoon etc. limit the availability of hydro 
power. Again, capacity addition from hydro plants are taking place at a very limited pace due to a host of reasons like 
delay in environmental and forest clearance, R&R problems etc.  Adequate Pumped Storage Plants are also not available. 
Therefore, for balancing, gas based plants has to be utilised. Gas based plants are of two types namely open cycle gas 
plants and combined cycle gas plants. Open cycle gas plants are very suitable for balancing and ramping requirement of 
the grid because of its quick start and stop time. But open cycle gas based plants are less efficient than the closed cycle 
ones. Now, of the total monitored gas based capacity of 24,037 MW, 350 MW is only open cycle and the balance are 
closed cycle plants. However, the new gas-based combined cycle power plants offer higher efficiency and can go from 
start to full load quicker. The total start-up time is just 30 minutes (from warm start) and shutdown time is 30 minutes. 
These  are  single  shaft  machines,  can  operate  at  a  minimum  load  of  20%,  and  therefore  are  best  suited  to  cater  the 
variability of RES.  
 
Presently, there is acute shortage of domestic gas for the Gas Based Power Plants.  During the year 2016-17, Gas Based 
Plants were running at a PLF of around 22.86%. To run gas plant at a PLF of 85%, normative gas requirement would 
be about 110 MMSCMD. This is significantly more than the present availability of 29.88 MMSCMD. The role of gas 
based plants during evening to meet the balancing power and ramping requirement is vital for the Indian grid.  
 
Optimisation studies showed that for integrating renewables of 175 GW by 2021-22 and to meet the peaking and ramping 
requirement of the system, PLF of gas based capacity during 2021-22 is likely to be around 37% compared to around 
22% at present. The gas requirement is of the order of about 45.27 MMSCMD. It has been observed from the studies 
that the gas based capacities are utilised maximum during the peak hours to meet the peak and the ramping requirement. 
The actual gas requirement may substantially get reduced in the event of any or all of the followings: 
  Maximisation of utilisation of domestic gas during peak hours to meet the peaking and the ramping 
requirement. 
  Utilisation of full peaking potential of the hydro plants. 
  Operation of some of the coal based thermal power plants in two shift. 
 
 Efforts should be made for exploring the modalities of implementation of the above keeping in view the grid stability, 
and commercial issues involved threin. 
 
 
8.6 STEPS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT TO OVERCOME SHORTAGE OF GAS  
 
Government of India has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to augment gas supplies and bridge the gap between supply 
and demand for the domestic market. These include: -

  Policy to grant relaxation, extension & classifications at development & production stage for early 
monetization of hydrocarbon discoveries. 
  Discovered Small Field Policy. 
  Formulation of Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) in March, 2016.  
 
 
Four main facets of this policy are: 
a)  Uniform license for exploration and production of all forms of hydrocarbon. The uniform licence will 
enable the contractor to explore conventional as well as unconventional oil and gas resources including 
CBM, shale gas/oil, tight gas and gas hydrates under a single license.  The concept of Open Acreage 
Policy will enable E&P companies choose the blocks from the designated area.  
b)  an open acreage policy, 
c)  easy to administer revenue sharing model and 
d)  marketing and pricing freedom for the crude oil and natural gas produced. 
 
The decision will enhance domestic oil & gas production, bring substantial investment in the sector and generate sizable 
employment. The policy is also aimed at enhancing transparency and reducing administrative discretion. 
 
  Policy for marketing freedom for gas produced from Deepwater & Ultra Deepwater areas. 
  MOP&NG is taking necessary steps to augment production of natural gas from the gas fields/wells by awarding 
gas blocks for Exploration & Production activities in various sedimentary basins of the country under the New 
Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP). 
  Encouraging import of gas in the form of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and also making efforts for import of 
gas through international pipelines projects. 
Implementation  of  Natural  Gas  Hydrate  Programme  (NGHP)  for  evaluation  of  hydrate  resources  and  their 
possible commercial exploitation.

8.7 
SCHEME FOR UTILIZATION OF GAS BASED GENERATION CAPACITY 
 
In order to optimally utilize gas based generation capacity and to meet the gas requirement of grid connected gas based 
capacity, Government of India has sanctioned a scheme which envisages supply of imported spot Liquefied Natural Gas 
(LNG) to the stranded gas based power plants as well as plants receiving domestic gas to revive and improve utilization 
of the stranded gas based power generation capacity in the country. The mechanism also envisages sacrifices to be made 
collectively  by  all  stakeholders,  including  the  Central  and  State  Governments  by  way  of  exemptions  from  certain 
applicable taxes and levies on the incremental LNG being imported for the purpose. The scheme envisages supply of 
imported spot Liquefied Natural Gas to the stranded gas based power plants through a reverse e-bidding process. The 
scheme is to be implemented for the years 2015-16 and 2016-17. The scheme envisages financial support from PSDF 
(Power System Development Fund). The outlay for the support from PSDF has been fixed at ₹ 7,500 crores (₹ 3,500 
crores and ₹ 4,000 crores for the year 2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively). 
 
A gas based capacity of 14,305 MW, comprising 5,194 MW of gas based plants having predominantly allocation from 
KGD6 fields, 3,762 MW of gas based capacity commissioned without any gas allocation and 5,349 MW of new gas 
based capacity which are ready for commissioning (if gas is made available) were considered as stranded.  
 
The  following  interventions/  sacrifices  are  envisaged  in  the  scheme,  to  be  made  by  the  Central  Government,  State 
Governments, power developers and gas transporters collectively.  
 
a)  Streamlining the procedure for availing Customs duty waiver on imported LNG for the gas based power plants 
b)  Waiver of Value Added Tax (VAT) on the e-bid RLNG 
c)  Waiver of Central Sales Tax (CST), Octroi and Entry Tax on the e-bid RLNG 
d)  Waiver of Service Tax on regasification and transportation of the e-bid RLNG 
e)  Reduction in pipeline tariff charges by 50%, reduction in marketing margin by 75% on incremental volumes 
by GAIL / other transporters on the e-bid RLNG 
f)  Capping of fixed cost to be recovered by the promoters: Power developers to forgo return on their equity.   
g)  Provision for co-mingling and swapping of gas

i)  Support from Power System Development Fund (PSDF) 
 
 
8.8 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
1.  The scheme for utilisation of gas based generation capacity introduced by Government of India is for two years 
only. But it is felt that a long term policy intervention is required for optimal utilization of gas based capacity 
in the country.  
 
2. 
In view of massive capacity addition target of 175 GW from RES, Gas Based Power plants in the country need 
to play a vital role in balancing and ramping requirements of the grid. Availability of at least 45.27 MMSCMD 
of gas to Gas Based Plants in the country needs to be ensured for this purpose. The actual gas requirement may 
reduce if full peaking potential of the hydro plants can be utilised and if the coal based thermal power plants 
can operated in a two shift. 
  
3.  The regasification capacity in the country is also a matter of concern for gas based power plants, particularly 
those who are connected with RGTIL East-West pipeline. Due to technical constraints like directional flows 
etc.,  imported  RLNG  from  west  coast  cannot  be  transported  to  power  plants  located  in  the  East  Coast. 
Therefore, facility of re-gasification capacity may be suitably created at East coast also.

CHAPTER 9 
 
COAL REQUIREMENT 
 
 
9.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
Fuel is the key input required to be tied up before implementation and proper operation of the thermal power plants. In 
the changed scenario with growing concern on environment, Government has given emphasis on Renewable Energy 
projects.  However,  Country’s  reliance  on  coal  based  generation  cannot  be  overlooked.   An  important  aspect  which, 
therefore, needs to be addressed is the availability of adequate coal to fuel the generation of power. In order to optimize 
coal usage, Government is committed for super critical/ ultra-super critical technology which are much more efficient 
and results into reduction in usage of coal. The timely availability of all the key inputs including fuel would ensure 
timely completion of the project and therefore avert detrimental implications of cost and time overruns in case the power 
project is delayed.  
 
This Chapter broadly deals with a review of coal availability during the 12th Plan, an assessment of requirement of fuel 
for the period 2017-22 & indicative requirement of the coal for the period 2022-27 as well as critical issues which need 
to  be  addressed  and  constraints  being  experienced  in  the  coal  sector.  This  would  give  a  broad  scenario  to  all  the 
associated stakeholders to enable them to take advance action and plan their production targets etc.  
 
9.1  COAL SUPPLY SCENARIO  
 
9.1.1 Background 
 
Coal is the mainstay of India’s energy sector. The All India Installed Capacity of the country is about 326,848 MW as 
on 31.03.2017, out of which about 192,163 MW (58.8%) is coal based. Once the power station is commissioned, the 
biggest challenge is to operate the station at a high plant load factor (PLF), which is a measure of the output of a power 
plant compared to the maximum output it could produce. Higher load factor usually means more output and a lower cost 
per unit of electricity generation. Performance of the power plant is measured on the basis of PLF and Station Heat Rate. 
However, the Plant Load Factor (PLF) of the coal based power stations in the country has been decreasing steadily over 
the years. The PLF has decreased from 78.9 % in 2007-08 to 59.64 % in 2016-17.  
 
9.1.2 New Coal Distribution Policy 
 
The Government has introduced the New Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP), effective from 1st April 2009, which assures 
supplies at pre-determined prices to some categories of consumers and reintroduces e-auctions to encourage a vibrant 
market for the commodity. The Main Features of the Policy are as follows: 
 
  100% Normative Requirement of coal would be considered for supply to Power Utilities. 
  Supply of coal through commercially enforceable Fuel Supply Agreements (FSAs) at notified prices by CIL.  
  10% of annual production of CIL to be offered through e-auction for consumers who are not able to source coal 
through available institutional mechanism. 
  FSAs to indicate Annual Contracted Quantities (ACQ) of  coal to Power Utilities by coal companies during 
entire year. Incentive and penalty clauses incorporated in FSAs.   
Signing of Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) 
 
Thermal power plants commissioned before 31st March 2009, FSAs were signed with a trigger value of 90% of the 
Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ). Subsequently, CCEA in 2013 directed CIL to sign FSAs for a total capacity of 
about 78,000 MW, which were likely to be commissioned by 31.03.2015. Out of 78000 MW, around 9,840 MW were 
having tapering linkages. Taking into account the overall domestic availability and the likely actual requirements of 
these power plants, FSA’s were signed for domestic coal quantity of 65%,65%,67%,75% of ACQ for the years 2013-
14,2014-15,2015-16  &  2016-17  respectively  for  power  plants  having  normal  coal  linkages.  However,  actual  coal 
supplies would be   commensurate to long term PPA’s.

9.1.3 Coal stocking norms 
The norms for number of days of coal stock for power stations is fixed depending on the distance of the power plant 
from the mine-head as given in Table 9.1.

9.1.4 Import of coal  
 
In the past, Power Utilities were advised to import coal to maintain the stipulations of Ministry of Environment  and 
Forest regarding use of coal  of less  than 34% ash content  and to occasionally supplement the coal from indigenous 
sources.  However,  due  to  inadequate  availability  of  domestic  coal,  power  utilities  were  advised  to  import  coal  for 
blending.  Further, with the commissioning of power plants designed for use of imported coal as fuel, power utilities 
imported coal to meet the requirement of fuel for these power plants.  The details of coal imported by power utilities to 
meet the  shortfall in the availability  of domestic coal and to meet the requirement of power plants on imported coal 
during 11th Plan & 12th Plan are furnished in Table 9.2 and Exhibit 9.1.

9.1.5 Critical /super critical stock at power plants 
 
Coal  stock  position  at  the  power  plants  is  being  monitored  on  daily  basis.  The  low  coal  stock  at  power  plants  is 
categorised as critical and super critical so that coal supply to such power plants could be augmented on priority. The 
criteria, given in Table 9.3 below, is being adopted for classifying critical / super critical coal stock at the power plants.  
Table 9.3 
Criteria for classifying critical / super critical coal stock 
 
 
The details of critical/ super critical coal stock at the power plants during 12th Plan period (upto 2016-17) are given in

It is seen from the above that power plants on domestic coal would meet their requirement of coal from indigenous 
sources and may not require import of coal for blending.  However, some power utilities /  power plants may plan for 
import of coal for blending for their coastal power plants considering economics in import of coal vis-à-vis domestic 
coal and Railway logistic constraints etc. Power plants designed on imported coal would continue to import coal to meet 
their coal requirement. 
  
9.3  COAL DEMAND AND AVAILABILITY DURING THE YEARS 2021-22 & 2026-27 
 
With the 19th EPS demand projections and likely Renewable Energy Sources (RES) capacity addition, the coal based 
generation has been estimated and accordingly provisional coal requirement has been worked out. The likely capacity 
of  RES  has  been  as  175GW  by  the  terminal  year  2021-22.    Accordingly,  in  the  year  2021-22,  the  estimated  gross 
generation from coal based power plants would be around 1072 BU. The details of coal requirement for the year 2021-
22  have  been  worked  out  considering  30%  reduction  in  Hydro  generation  due  to  failure  of  monsoon  and  being 
supplemented by coal based generation. 
 
During 2026-27, the total capacity of RES has been estimated to be 275 GW capacity, considering 175 GW of total 
capacity at the end of the year 2021-22 and 100 GW capacity addition of RES during 2022-27. The generation from 
coal-based power plants is estimated as 1259 BU for the year 2026-27. The coal requirement for the year 2026-27 has

In order to enhance coal availability, multi-dimensional efforts are underway by Coal India Ltd to enhance production 
of domestic coal.  A road  map has been prepared by  CIL  to substantially enhance coal  production level to 1 Billion 
Tonnes (BT) by the year 2019-20. With this programme there would be no shortage in the availability of coal for the 
power plants during 2021-22 and 2026-27. In addition, coal production from the captive coal blocks allotted to power 
utilities would also supplement the availability of domestic coal. 
 
9.3.1  Issues/constraints in making coal available to power stations 
 
Timely availability of adequate coal is extremely crucial for maximizing generation from the power plants. In addition 
to tapping fuel source or organizing its availability, it is also essential to create the infrastructure to facilitate fuel to 
reach  the  intended  destination.  Therefore,  development  of  mines/  ports  and  requisite  transportation  facilities 
commensurate with the completion of the projects is very necessary. The gestation period in the development of mines 
and even transport facilities are in some cases longer than the gestation period for setting up of thermal power stations. 
It is, therefore, imperative for the  Power Sector to make  its prospective coal requirement, over a long time horizon, 
known to the Ministry of Coal, Railways and port authorities to enable them to undertake co-ordinated development of 
coal mines and transport infrastructure with the coming up of thermal power stations.  
 
9.4  NEW INITIATIVES FOR ADDRESSING ISSUES RELATED TO COAL SUPPLY TO THE POWER 
PLANTS 
 
9.4.1 Rationalization of Coal Linkages 
 
In order to undertake a comprehensive review of existing sources of coal and considering the feasibility of rationalization 
of these sources to optimize cost of coal transportation, a new Inter-Ministerial Task Force (IMTF) was constituted by 
Ministry of Coal in June, 2014. Also CIL engaged M/s KPMG Advisory Services Private Ltd to assist the Task Force 
in optimization exercise. Report of Inter-Ministerial Task Force (IMTF) and Part-I of KPMG report was discussed with 
the power utilities on 2nd December, 2014. IMTF report was agreed by the concerned power utilities. As per KPMG, 
total benefit by way of logistic savings was expected in the range of ₹ 3500 to ₹ 6000 crores. The new Inter-Ministerial 
Task Force (IMTF) had recommended a three step approach for implementation.  
 
i. 
The recommendations inter-alia included rationalization of linkage sources for 19 power utilities in Stage-I by 
swapping linkage coal between different coal companies to optimize distances and maximizing dispatches of 
coal.  As per status of implementation of recommendations of IMTF, Coal India Ltd. executed revised Fuel 
Supply  Agreement  (FSA)  with  17  power  plants  in  respect  of  Stage-I  rationalization.  This  had  resulted  in 
movement rationalization of 24.6 MT coal with annual savings of ₹ 913 crores (approximately) of recurring 
transportation cost.

9. 9 
           Central Electricity Authority 
 National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
ii. 
The Task Force recommended rationalization of 6 swap sets among power utilities in Stage-II which envisaged 
swapping of coal between ‘imported coal and domestic coal’ and ‘domestic coal of different power stations 
among 6 States involving 11 power utilities in Centre /State/ Private Sector. 
iii. 
Among the participating companies, 19 swaps were envisaged. Out of these swaps, only 6 swaps (saving 952 
Crores) were agreed for implementation. However, with the improved availability of coal for pit head power 
plants, the swaps agreed for swapping of imported coal with domestic coal for pit head plants was not feasible. 
Thus, at present, only 4 swaps (saving ₹ 687 Crores) are under implementation/consideration and out of which, 
only one set of swap has been implemented result in movement of rationalization of 1.3 MT coal and potential 
annual savings of ₹ 458 crores of transportation cost. 
 
With the implementation of Stage-I and Stage-II of recommendations of the IMTF, movement rationalization 
of 25.9 MT coal has been taken is with potential annual saving of ₹ 1371 crores of transportation cost.   
9.4.2  Third Party Sampling 
 
In order to address quality concern of the coal supply to power plants, it was decided in the meeting held in Ministry of 
Power on 28.10.2015 that coal samples shall be collected and prepared by a Single Third Party Agency appointed by 
power utilities and coal companies. It was suggested that CIMFR may undertake bidding process for appointment of 
Third Party Sampling Agencies on behalf of power utilities and coal companies. Necessary funding arrangement shall 
be made by coal companies and power utilities on equal sharing basis. 
 
A committee constituted with Director (Operations), NTPC and Director (Marketing), Coal India Ltd. as Co- Chairman 
with  representatives  from  CEA,  NTPC,  CIL,  DVC,  APP,  State  of  Gujarat,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Rajasthan,  Haryana, 
Karnataka and Railways to look into the issues of Third Party Sampling has been constituted and prepared a road map 
for implementation of decisions on Third Party Sampling.  The terms of reference for the committee was as under: 
i. 
The committee to look into issues of third party sampling for coal supplies for power sector including e- auction. 
ii. 
The issue of re-grading of mines in case there is persistence variation of mine declared grades with results of 
third party sampling. 
iii. 
Issue of coal shortfall on account of energy shortage due to grade slippage as per third party report at loading 
end. 
iv. 
Issue of non-materialization of quantity of coal due to non-placement of Railway rakes against indents of CIL. 
v. 
Issue of adjustment of quantity of coal due to variation in actual delivered quantity vs normative wagon carrying 
capacity. 
vi. 
Involvement of Railways to ensure transportation of coal as per billed quality and quantity. 
vii. 
Feasibility of the following aspects: 
  Use of IT in GPS tracking of coal supply 
  On-line coal analysers/auto samplers to address issues at loading end 
  Online submission of analysis results of coal samples for speedy settlement of bills 
It has been decided that CIMFR will undertake the work of third party sampling at unloading point, i.e., at the power 
plant end. Therefore, with the sampling of coal at loading and at unloading point will address the issues of quality and 
grade slippage of the coal supplied to power utilities in their power plants. 
 
9.4.3 Flexibility in Utilization of Domestic Coal 
 
In order to achieve flexibility in utilization of domestic coal for reducing the cost of power generation, the proposal for 
allowing flexibility in utilization of domestic coal was approved by the Cabinet on 4.05.2016. Under the scheme, the 
Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ) of each individual coal linkage as per Fuel Supply Agreement is to be aggregated 
as consolidated ACQ for each State and Company owning Central Generating Stations instead of individual generating

station. The State/Central Gencos would have flexibility to utilize their coal in most efficient and cost effective manner 
in their own power plants as well as by transferring coal to other State/Central Gencos Power plants for generation of 
cheaper  power.  The  States  may  also  transfer  coal  to  efficient  IPPs  selected  through  e-Bidding  process.  Ministry  of 
Power/Central Electricity Authority in consultation with all the Stake holders has prepared and issued the methodology 
for  flexibility  in  utilization  of  domestic  coal.  Supplementary  agreements  have  been  signed  by  power  utilities  for 
aggregation of ACQ with coal subsidiaries/CIL. The flexibility in utilization of domestic coal will result in reduction of 
cost of electricity to the consumers. 
 
 
9.5  COAL WASHERIES IN INDIA 
In India, 20 percent of coal produced is washed as against a global average of 50 percent. Coking coal preparation has 
long  been  in  operation  in  India  but  recently,  the  trend  has  been  shifted  to  washing  of  non-coking  coal  due  to 
environmental and efficiency concerns. The long distance transportation of coal via land routes offer an ideal opportunity 
for coal washing in India because of economic benefits. Though coal washery increases the overall cost of coal, but the 
benefits accrued in terms of saving in transportation, O&M cost and efficiency are sustained. 
Ministry  of  Environment  &  Forests  vide  Notification  G.S.R.  02(E),  dated  January  02,  2014,  has  amended  Rules  in 
respect of use of washed/ blended or beneficiated coal with ash content not exceeding thirty-four percent on quarterly 
average basis in Thermal Power Plants. As per the amended rules, power plants located beyond 500 kms from the pithead 
shall  be  supplied  with  and  shall  use  raw  or  blended  or  beneficiated  coal  with  ash  content  not  exceeding  thirty-four 
percent on quarterly average basis w.e.f. 5th June 2016. Ministry of Coal/CIL is required to take necessary action for 
compliance of the above. 
9.6  LIGNITE 
 
Lignite reserves in the country have been estimated at around 40.9 Billion tonnes, most of which is found in the State 
of Tamil Nadu. About 82 % of the Lignite reserves are located in the State of Tamil Nadu & Pondicherry. At present 
only  a  small  percentage  of  the  total  reserves  of  lignite  have  been  exploited.  Considerable  scope  remains  for  the 
exploitation of the lignite reserves and use of lignite in thermal power stations subject to cost-economics. State-wise 
distribution of Lignite resources is shown in Table- 9.9.

CHAPTER-10 
KEY INPUTS  
 
10.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Timely availability of all key inputs - as per the schedule of requirement of the individual power projects, is vital for 
successful  implementation  of  any  Power  Plant.    Infrastructural  support  such  as  port  facility,  construction  & 
manufacturing capabilities specifically erection machinery and erection agencies including civil and BOP contractors 
are also of utmost importance. This Chapter therefore examines the availability of following key inputs –  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Manufacturing capacity for equipment  
Major Materials – Cement, Steel, Castings, Forgings, Tubes & Pipes 
Transport – Railways and Ports 
Gas pipelines including regasification facilities 
       Land and Water for Thermal stations   
 
Availability of other inputs like Fuel, Funds and Man-power have been dealt in separate chapters. 
 
The estimation of materials has been made based on the estimates already available for the past plan (NEP-2012) with 
suitable  changes/modifications  for  large  supercritical  units  and  latest  manufacturing  trends  indicated  by  the 
manufacturers.  Inputs  for  Cement  and  other  materials  for  nuclear  projects  have  been  considered  at  130%  of  the 
requirement  of  coal  based  projects  based on  the  assessment  of  Nuclear  Power  Corporation  (NPCIL)  for  NEP-2012.  
Inputs for hydro projects have been retained from the NEP-2012. 
 
Availability of transportation has been estimated based on the issues/constraints identified in the previous Plan and the 
developments and policy initiatives brought out by various Ministries during the deliberations.  Suggestions for further 
improvements have also been indicated based on the inputs received during the deliberations from the manufacturers 
and utilities.  
 
Major share of capacity addition during the coming years is planned through renewable sources like solar and wind. As 
the inputs required for the renewables stations are substantially different from those for conventional stations, these have 
been covered as a separate sub-section.  
 
10.1  CAPACITY ADDITION PLAN 
 
Based on the review of 12th Plan, the targeted and anticipated capacity addition during the 12th Plan (2012-17) is given 
in Table 10.1.

As may be seen the 12th Plan witnessed a total capacity addition of over 99 GW (Table 10.2) as against targeted capacity 
addition of 88.5 GW.  This, coupled with large scale renewables planned have led to sharp reduction in the thermal 
capacity addition requirements during 2017-22. Accordingly, the capacity addition required during 2017-22 given in 
Table 10.3.

Note: **Since 47,855 MW of coal based plant are expected to come during 2017-22 and will be partially utilized during 
2017-22, therefore, this coal based capacity addition of 47,855 MW may be utilized during 2022-27. Hence, ONLY 
46,420 MW additional coal based capacity addition may be required during 2022-27 
 
10.2  AVAILABILITY OF EQUIPMENT  
 
10.2.1 Main plant equipment  
 
As has been decided by the Ministry of Power that entire coal based capacity addition during the years 2017-22 and 
subsequent  Plan  periods  shall  be  through  supercritical  units.  Requisite  indigenous  manufacturing  capacity  for 
manufacture of super-critical units is considered vital to ensure lifetime support for services and spares, specific problem

solving and customization for trouble free operation of these units in the Indian conditions. As a result of the efforts 
made by the Government over the last decade for creating indigenous manufacturing capacity for supercritical units, 
BHEL entered into technology collaborations and several joint ventures by the International manufacturers were set up 
for indigenous manufacturing of supercritical main plant equipment.  
Encouraged  by  the  bulk  orders  awarded  by  the  Government  with  mandatory  Phased  Manufacturing  Programme 
provisions, most joint ventures are under advanced stage of completion of the manufacturing facilities and have also 
started rolling out components/sub-assemblies etc. from their manufacturing facilities. The indigenous manufacturing 
capacity for supercritical main plant equipment likely to be available from BHEL and the JVs are given in Table 10.5.

Thus, adequate indigenous manufacturing capacity of supercritical main plant equipment is available in the country. 
Most  manufacturers  do  not  have  requisite  orders  and  have  expressed  concerns  on  lack  of  orders.  Indigenous 
manufacturing capacity for hydro and nuclear stations also exists in the country. 
 
Indigenous manufacturing capacity for Gas Turbines/combined cycle stations is also available in the country and large 
sized Gas Turbines including advanced class are being manufactured by BHEL.   
 
10.2.2 Balance of Plant (BoP) equipment 
 
Balance  of  Plant  systems  such  as  Coal  Handling  Plant,  Ash  Handling  Plant,  Water  Treatment  /  DM  Plant,  Cooling 
Towers,  CW  System,  Chimney,  electrical  systems  and  switchyard  etc.  were  identified  as  critical  items  for  timely 
commissioning of thermal power projects in the 12th Plan and several measures like standardisation of BoP systems, 
reviewing  the  qualifying  requirements  to  ensure  quality  vendors  and  large  vendors  for  faster  execution  of  projects,   
mandating a central organization to maintain a dynamic data base with regard to BOP orders were suggested.  
The above issues have been largely addressed and in the 12th Plan generally no constraints/delays on account of BoP 
have been faced.  However, off-late, constraints in availability of good BoP systems vendors are being felt as many of 
the good Coal Handling Plant/Ash handling plant vendors are not in good financial health.  Even in the EPC contracts, 
the EPC agency normally sub-contracts BoP systems or procures these as bought out items and thus availability of good 
BoP vendors is vital for all projects. NTPC brought out that, due to lack of good contracting agencies in Coal Handling 
Plants(CHP) & Ash handling Plants (AHP) with good financial health, works get affected in these areas and NTPC is 
required  to  make  lot  of  efforts  in  making  available  supplies  and  making  these  systems  ready  to  match  with  the 
commissioning requirement.  In several cases, NTPC had to terminate the contracts awarded due to non-performance of 
the vendors – like Ash handling plant system at Solapur, VSTPP-IV and Barh-I projects and coal handling plant at Kanti 
TPS. 
The major reasons identified for poor performance of the agencies are as under: 
  Agencies  have  taken  works  beyond  their  capacities  and  are  not  able  to  mobilize  the  resources  to  meet  the 
commissioning targets

  Cash flow problems / financial crunch of agencies  
  Many a times, works taken at lower prices but not able to sustain during execution 
In such cases where constraints are felt by BoP vendors or where contract have been terminated, NTPC has adopted the 
following action Plan for completing the projects: -  
 
  Taking materials through sub-vendors by giving comfort letters and making direct payments to sub-vendors.  
  Direct payments to sub-agencies working at sites to ensure that regular payments to the labourers working at 
site. 
  Hiring cranes and other T&Ps. and providing these, to the agencies on chargeable basis. 
BoP  systems  in  power  stations  are  generally  material  handling  systems  which  are  common  to  several  other  large 
industries  like  cement,  steel  etc.  and  vendors  are  operating  across  number  of  such  industries.  Some  main  plant 
equipment/EPC contractors have also reported that BoP vendors and civil contractors prefer “Non-Power” works. Thus, 
a long term solution for ensuring requisite availability of good BoP vendors needs to be found. 
The NEP-2012 had suggested mandating a central organization to maintain a dynamic data base with regard to BOP 
orders  and  their  liquidation.  Considering  the  constraints  being  faced  by  the  power  sector,  it  is  felt  that  such  an 
organizational mechanism for information sharing on BoP vendors across industries needs to be considered.  Such a 
mechanism could provide the following salient details: - 
  A web based portal for sharing all information relating to BoP vendors viz. orders at hand, their implementation 
status etc. orders completed, feedback of the customers so that project developers can take informed decisions. 
  Availability of T&P and trained Skilled/Semi-skilled man power available with the vendor.  
  In second phase the BoP vendors and Construction agencies could be rated based on their performance. 
 
It is also felt that new advanced technologies BoP systems like High Concentration Slurry Disposal (HCSD) type ash 
disposal systems, closed pipe type conveyers for coal handling plants (CHP), large size R.O systems would be required, 
and requisite capacity for implementation of these systems and also indigenous manufacturing of key equipment for 
such systems should be developed.  
 
10.3 AVAILABILITY OF KEY MATERIALS 
 
Availability of the following key materials has been assessed for thermal, hydro and Nuclear capacity addition planned: 
- 
  Steel - Structural Steel and Reinforcement steel 
  Cement 
  Aluminum 
  Boiler Tubes & Pipes 
  Thicker Boiler Quality Plates 
  Castings & Forgings for Turbo-Generators (TG) Sets 
 
As has been brought out, the estimation of materials for thermal projects has been made based on the inputs received 
from the equipment manufacturers - the norms adopted for estimation of material in the past plan (NEP-2012) were 
reviewed  by  the  manufacturers  and  modifications  indicated  have  been  suitably  incorporated.  Inputs  for  Cement  and 
other materials for nuclear projects have been considered at 130% of the requirement of coal based projects.   
 
10.3.1 Norms Adopted for Estimation 
The norms adopted for estimation of materials are given in Table 10.6 and Table 10.7.

The above norms for castings and forgings have been considered for estimation of materials. While the weight of castings 
and forgings indicated by different manufacturers varies, the total weight of castings and forgings indicated by them do 
not vary significantly. Some manufacturers have also indicated lower requirements of castings/forgings, however for 
estimation purposes, the higher values have been considered.

2017-22, therefore, this coal based capacity addition of 47,855 MW may be utilized during 2022-27. Hence, 
ONLY 46,420 MW additional coal based capacity addition may be required during 2022-27

Note: Additional coal based capacity of  46,420 MW  during 2022-27 is over and above 47,855 MW 
coal based capacity under construction and likely to yield benefits during 2017-22, for which it 
is  presumed  that  orders  have  already  been  placed,  therefore  the  material  requirement  is 
considered as NIL. 
As may be seen from above, based on demand projections, the coal based capacity addition requirements during 2017-
22  comes  out  to  be  6,445  MW.  However,  coal  based  projects  to  the  tune  of  about  47855  MW  are  already  under 
construction and are likely to get commissioned during 2017-22.   
 
 
 
Indigenous  manufacturing  facilities  for  castings  and  forgings  is  available  at  BHEL  Hardwar  and  with  other 
manufacturers like L&T and Bharat forge. BHEL central forge and foundry plant (CFFP) Haridwar have considerably 
augmented  their  capacity  and  are  now  manufacturing  castings  and  forgings  for  660/800  MW  units  except  for  some

special castings. The total capacity of castings and forgings for BHEL CFFP Haridwar is 10,000 tons per annum. L&T 
and Bharat forge also have world class casting and forging capability. L&T forge plant has capacity to produce large 
casting of up to 54 tons – suitable for 660/800 MW units. Thus BHEL and other indigenous manufacturers have adequate 
indigenous  capacity  for  castings  and  forgings.  However,  the  designs  of  castings/forgings  are  specific  to  each 
manufacturer  and  manufacturers  adopt  different  designs,  material  composition  etc.  based  on  their  OEMs  standard 
practice. Thus most manufacturers presently use imported castings/forgings. 
 
  
The equipment manufacturers have brought out that most of the tubes and plates are required to be imported. Tubes up 
to grade T 20 are indigenously available and beyond that tubes are imported. Similarly, Carbon Steel pipes up to 8” (200 
Normal Bore) size are available indigenously but beyond that are imported. Alloy steel pipes to ASTM grade A 335 
P91/P92 and thick walled carbon steel pipes to ASTM grade A106 Gr C are imported due to lack of domestic availability. 
Special fittings, Critical valves like Control valves are not available indigenously. There is no indigenous capacity for 
manufacturing of thick boiler plates and they are entirely imported. SAIL has brought out that they are manufacturing 
only electric resistance welded (ERW) tubes and are not manufacturing seamless tubes required for boilers. Besides, 
there is no indigenous capacity for manufacturing of CRGO/CRNGO steels at present and these steels are imported. 
During the deliberations held with the manufacturers and ministry of steel in the meetings of   NEP sub-committee for 
key inputs, it was agreed by all that indigenous manufacturing of critical steels and tubes and plates needs to be created. 
Ministry  of  steel/SAIL  agreed  to  undertake  R&D  for  indigenous  development  of  various  special  steels  used  in 
manufacturing of boilers and Turbine generators. It is suggested that a joint mechanism may be created under Ministry 
of Steel with participation of power equipment manufacturers and steel manufacturers for more information sharing on 
compositions/properties  of  various  steels  and  steel  products  required  and  their  indigenous  development  by  the  steel 
industry.  
 
10.4 RAIL TRANSPORTATION  
Rail transportation is critical for movement of equipment as well as coal to power stations. The NEP-2012 and the 12th 
Plan working group on power by the planning commission had stressed on  
 
  Creation of dedicated freight corridors (DFC),  
  Augmentation  of  capacity  to  evacuate  coal  from  major  coal  fields  namely  North  Karanpura,  Ib  Valley, 
Talcher and Mand Raigarh. 
  Rail connectivity to all ports having coal unloading facilities especially the minor ports. 
  Gauge conversion, new railway lines, electrification of new routes 
Railways  have  indicated  that,  while  Dedicated  Freight  Corridors  (DFCs)  are  being  pursued,  parallel  efforts  are  also 
being made for augmentation of Railway lines; so as to overcome any constraints being felt in transportation. Major 
railway projects have been undertaken in Central & Eastern railway. Also, a coordination mechanism between Ministry 
of  Power  and  Ministry  of  Railways  exists  for  identifying  bottlenecks/priorities  for  transportation  and  based  on  the 
assessment/discussions  therein  the  Raipur  -  Titlagarh  line  has  already  been  advanced  for  commissioning  in  2018  as 
against  2020  planned  earlier.  Railways  have  also  been  requested  to  ensure  that  no  constraints  are  faced  in  North 
Karanpura area where Coal India Ltd is coming with new mines and Coal from these mines as well as from NTPC coal 
blocks in that area would be required to move to Central region. 
Regarding rail line connectivity for  minor ports, Railways  have brought out that  Ministry of Railways  have taken a 
policy decision not to undertake any fresh projects for connectivity to new/minor ports and all such projects for port 
connectivity will be undertaken on PPP model where JVs would be formed by the port developers; with Railways as 26 
% equity partner. Such an arrangement would facilitate land acquisition for the lines by the Railways while also ensuring 
requisite  participation  by  the  port  developers.  Such  a  mechanism  lowers  the  financial  burden  of  new  projects  on 
Railways, ensures commitment of the other stakeholders (port developers etc.) and also leads to benefits of Revenue 
sharing to the Stakeholders.

The white paper2 brought out by Railways in Feb-2015, envisages a shelf of 154 New Line projects with total length of 
17105 km at a projected cost of ₹ 173,448 crores and 208 nos. gauge conversion and doubling projects covering 18,976 
km at a cost of ₹ 94,937 crores. The shelf of projects has been categorised with a view to providing focused attention 
and assured funding to various categories. With the present levels of funding, the prioritized projects may take anywhere 
from 3 to 13 years to complete. Thus many projects have been taken on cost sharing basis with the industry – two such 
projects have been taken up with Coal India and one with NTPC.   
The  Railways  policy  on  participation  of  the  private  sector  in  providing  last  mile  connectivity  to  ports,  large  mines, 
cluster of industries for building rail connectivity and capacity augmentation has proposed the following five models: 
 
 i) Non-Government private line model 
ii) Joint Venture  
iii) Capacity augmentation through funding by customer 
iv) BOT 
v) Capacity augmentation through annuity model. 
All  the  models  provide  a  clear  revenue  stream  to  the  investor  for  making  the  connectivity  projects  bankable. Three 
Model Concession Agreements for private line model, joint venture and BOT have been approved and put in public 
domain. The agreements for the other two models are under approval process. 
 
10.5 ROAD TRANSPORTATION  
 
Road  transportation  provides  last  mile  connectivity  to  the  power  projects  in  conjunction  with  other  modes  of 
transportation like Railways and ports; while it is the sole mode for transportation for large over dimension consignment 
(ODC). The NEP-2012 and the 12th Plan working group on power by the planning commission had stressed on: - 
 
  Augmentation of Roads and Highways for transportation of Over Dimensioned Consignments (ODC) for 
higher size units. 
  Amendment in Motor Vehicle Act to accommodate  heavy  consignments above 49 MT and inclusion of 
hydraulic axle trailers. 
  Review of load classification for Roads & Bridges by IRC/ MoRTH to accommodate ODCs beyond 100 
MT. 
  Single window clearance and onetime payment for ODC movement. 
  Proper design of Toll Plazas built on highways. 
  Changes in Road design in North Eastern & Hill states to minimise sharp curves/gradients in roads and have 
sufficient vertical clearance in underpasses. 
  Proper Approach Roads for Hydro Projects 
 
The  issue  of  ODC  movement  is  the  most  critical  for  power  projects.  However,  the  equipment  manufacturers  have 
indicated that despite constant follow up for the last several years there has been no satisfactory solution to the above 
mentioned  issues.  With  substantial  number  of  state  specific  clearances  required  at  present,  turn  over  time  for 
lorries/demurrage goes up considerably; and with limited availability of agencies for large ODC movements, this leads 
to delays   in transportation of critical items, leading to delays in project execution. Thus the issue needs to be addressed 
on  priority.  Manufacturers  have  given  several  suggestions  like  –  adoption  of  standardized  maximum  axle  weight  of 
around 16 MT/axle and no approvals should be required thereafter, single window clearance system for ODCs as against 
case to case basis by individual state authorities at present. It has also been suggested that a National Bridge Up-gradation

Programme may be taken up by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) in partnership with Central & 
State authorities for upgradation of all bridges to minimum strength facilitating ODC movements. 
MoRTH have  indicated that approval of ODC on national  highways  has been  made online. It is seen from MoRTH 
website  that  a  system  for  online  clearance  for  ODC  movements  is  operational3.  However,  it  is  seen  that  the  online 
clearance pertains to only the bridges on National Highways (NH) and there also it excludes bridges with span greater 
than 50 metre. Quote - The movement has been allowed on NHs and for bridges having span length less than 50 metres 
except  distress  bridges  (bridges  which  are  unsafe  for  carrying  IRC  loads  as  per  Ministry's  Circular  no. 
RWNH35072/1/2010S& R(B) dated 20th May ,2014. The movement of bridges having span length >50 metres or bridges 
not  covered  in  Ministry's  Circular  no.RWNH35072/1/2010S&  R(B)  dated  24/01/2013  shall  be  allowed  only  after 
checking adequacy as per IRC:SP:37:2010 and completing the procedure as per Circular dated 20th May,2014. 
From a typical approval for BHEL Hyderabad to Wanakbori TPS available on the MoRTH website, it is seen that there 
are 8 distressed bridges and 10 other bridges involved where no ODC movement is permitted. Also there are 11 bridges 
(10 special bridges and 1 bridge  of span greater than 50 metres)  where ODC  movement shall be allowed only after 
checking adequacy and completing the procedure thereby implying specific clearance to be sought. Thus as has been 
brought out by the manufacturers such a system has little utility as substantial specific clearances are required in spite 
of this online system. Thus the suggestion of manufacturers towards adoption of standardized maximum axle weight of 
around 16 MT/axle and no approvals should be required thereafter, single window clearance system for ODCs as against 
case to case basis by individual state authorities at present or undertaking a National Bridge Up-gradation Programme 
by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) in partnership with Central & State authorities for upgradation 
of  all  bridges  to  minimum  strength  facilitating  ODC  movements  need  to  be  seriously  considered  to  remove  the 
constraints prevailing in ODC movements. 
 
 
10.6  PORTS 
 
Ports are vital for transportation of imported coal as well as equipment for the projects. The NEP-2012 and the 12th Plan 
working group on power by the planning commission had stressed on the following for ports development: - 
 
  Adequate coal unloading arrangement at Ports to handle imported and domestic coal. 
  On the East Coast, coal handling facilities to be augmented at Paradip and Vizag Ports to evacuate coal 
from mines in Orissa as rail routes are congested. 
  Mechanisation of all major and important minor ports by augmenting crane capacities, silos, conveyors & 
wagon tipplers. 
Increasing draft at various ports to handle Panamax or capsize vessels. 
 
  Creation of RO-RO berths in at least two major ports namely Kandla on the west coast and Paradip on the 
east coast for unloading ODCs. 
  Road connectivity to ports to handle ODCs has to be ensured. 
 
Ministry of Shipping have brought out that out of the 12 major ports in the country, six ports namely Haldia, Paradip, 
Tuticorin, New Manglore are handling Coal and the present capacity of these ports to  handle the coal is 75  million 
tons/annum. Also, Ministry of Shipping has taken a policy decision that further augmentation of capacity at the major 
ports would be done through PPP mode only. 
 
The Ministry of Shipping, Government of India has 12 Major Ports under the administrative control of the Ministry viz. 
Kolkata, Paradip, Visakhapatnam, Chennai, Kamarajar Port (Ennore), V O Chidambarnar (Tuticorin), New Mangalore, 
Mormugao, Cochin, Mumbai, Kandla and Jawaharlal Nehru Port. There are 6 Major Ports on the West Coast of India

and 6 Major Ports on East Coast on India. Besides, there  are several  minor Ports which are not in the  Scope  of the 
Ministry and they come under the purview of the State Governments. 
The Major Ports have a total capacity of 871.52 million tonnes as on 31st March, 2015. The Major Ports at Haldia Dock 
(Kolkata  Port), Paradip,  Ennore,  V  O  Chidambarnar,  New  Mangalore  and  Mormugao  have  dedicated  coal  handling 
facilities. Further, the Port of Visakhapatnam also handles coal at multipurpose berth. The capacity of  dedicated coal 
handling facilities is 74.56 million tonnes as on 31.3.2015. 
 
 
The capacity augmentation projects at Major Ports are undertaken on Public Private Partnership model (PPP) only where 
the private developers develop their own jetties and handling, navigation and other facilities are provided by the port 
authorities.  The  Request  for  qualification  process  is  initiated  based  on  the  demand  for  cargo  capacity  for  different 
category of cargo. The qualified bidders at RFQ stage are entitled to participate in RFP (Request for Proposal) with 
revenue sharing model with the concerned Major Ports. The model Concession Agreement between PPP operator and 
the Port is signed with conditions for the Project thereof. 
 
Ministry of shipping has brought out that it may be necessary for the Power Companies to enter into Memorandum of 
Understanding  (MOU)  for  logistic  Plan  for  evacuation  of  Thermal  Coal.  Based  on  the  MoU,  the  capacity  with 
development of berth is taken up by the concerned Port. A copy of the procedure to be followed for appraisal/approval 
of PPP projects in ports, notified by the Central Government is placed at Annexure-10.1.  
 
10.7 INLAND WATERWAYS 
 
The following five major river/canal systems have been declared as National Waterways4:- 
  Ganga - Bhagirathi - Hooghly river system between Haldia (Sagar) & Allahabad (total 1620 km) - declared as 
National Waterway No.1 (NW-1) in 1986. 
Brahmaputra river between Bangladesh Border and Sadiya (891 Km) - declared as National Waterway no. 2 
(NW-2) in 1988 
 
  West  coast  canal  (Kottapuram  -  Kollam),  Udyogmandal  canal  (Kochi-  Pathalam  bridge)  and  Champakara 
canal (Kochi - Ambalamugal) (total 205 km) – declared as National Waterway No.3 (NW-3) in 1993

 
 
In addition, Lakhipur to Bhanga stretch of river Barak (121 km) in Assam is proposed as National Waterway -6  
Some of the waterways like NW-1 and NW-2 are well developed.  
i. 
On NW-1, Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) is carrying out various developmental works 
for  improvement  in  navigability  and  development  &  maintenance  of  other  infrastructure  such  as 
terminals  and  navigation  aids.  IWAI  had  been  maintaining  a  Least  Available  Depth  (LAD)  of  3.0 
meters between Haldia (Sagar) & Farakka (560 km), 2.5 meters in Farakka - Barh (400 km), 2.0 meters 
in Barh  - Ghazipur (290 km) and 1.2 to 1.5 meters in Chunar  - Allahabad sector (370 km) on this 
waterway (NW-1).  
Several large cargo movements have already been carried out on this waterway – like trial movements 
of 2600 tonnes fertilizer of M/s Tata Chemicals from Haldia to Fatuha (Patna), 2500 tonnes fertilizer 
of  M/s  IFFCO  Phulpur  from  Fatuha  (Patna)  to  Kolkata  was  done  successfully  during  2013-

and Kolkata - Patna - Kolkata sections during 2013-14. 
On NW-2, IWAI is maintaining a navigable depth of 2.5m in Bangladesh Border- Neamati (629 Km), 
2.0 m in Neamati  – Dibrugarh (139 Km) and 1.5m in Dibrugarh  – Sadiya (Oriumghat)  stretch.  At 
present the waterway is being used by vessels of Government of Assam, CIWTC, Border Security 
Forces,  Tourism  organization  and  other  private  operators.  Long  cruise  tourist  vessels  are  making 
voyages between Sivsagar near Dibrugarh and Manas wild life sanctuary near Jogighopa regularly. 
Over  dimensional  cargo  (ODC)  is  also  transported  through  the  waterway  from  time  to  time. 
Transportation  of  POL  (petroleum,  oil  and  lubricants)  was  also  made  through  this  waterway  from 
Silghat to Budge-Budge (West Bengal) and Baghmari (Bangladesh). 
iii. 
 
 
Inland waterways can be effectively used for Coal transportation as it is exerting a lot of pressure on Indian Railways 
network; thus wherever feasible, transportation of coal (particularly imported coal) using Inland Waterways can be 
looked into. 
  
A  beginning  has  already  been  made  by  NTPC  for  transportation  of  imported  coal  to  Farakka  station  through 
National  Waterway-1.  The  transportation  has  already  started  in  Nov'13  and  till  31.12.2015,  a  total  of  about  1.2 
MMT imported coal has been supplied to Farakka through this mode. The salient details of the mechanism/process 
employed are as under: - 
 
a. 
NTPC executed a Tripartite Agreement with Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) and selected 
the Operator. As per agreement, the Operator is required to: - 
i.  Unload and transport 3 MMTPA imported coal from high seas (Sandheads/Kanika Sands – about 140 
kms from Haldia) to Farakka power plant.  
ii.  Create the infrastructure from transfer point in mid sea to NTPC coal stock yard including Transhipper, 
Barges, Unloading arrangement at Farakka waterfront, Conveyor (about 2.5 km) from jetty to Farakka 
coal stockyard 
iii.  Operate and maintain the project for 7 years from COD 
iv.  NTPC had given commitment for transport of 3 MMTPA coal through inland waterway for 7 years 
from COD. 
v.  Entire investment for the project is to be made by the operator. Payments for the coal transported by 
the Operator is made by the Imported Coal Supplier (ICS) appointed by NTPC time to time. 
vi.  Material handling system at Farakka shall be transferred to NTPC after 7 years of operation.  
b. 
IWAI is required to ensure Least Available Depth (LAD) of 2.5 m for minimum 330 days in a year and 
navigational aids for round the clock operation. 
The  project  commenced  its  operation  on  28.10.2013  and  first  set  of  03  barges  reached  Farakka  on 
13.11.2013, carrying approx. 1500 MT each of imported coal. 
c. 
Several thermal power stations are operational on the banks of Ganga in the States of West Bengal and Bihar. Also 
several  more  Thermal  Power  Stations  are  proposed/under  construction  in  Bihar  and  Uttar  Pradesh.  Their  coal 
requirement  can  be  met  through  IWT.  Railways  &  Waterways  can  jointly  develop  routes/  strategies  for  easing  out 
movement of coal & power equipment to the power projects. 
 
10.8 LNG REGASIFICATION & PIPELINES FOR TRANSPORTATION OF NATURAL GAS 
 
The  prevailing  regasification  capacity  for  LNG  in  the  country  stands  at  about  21  Million  metric  tons  per  annum 
(MMTPA). However, only a part of this capacity is available for power sector.   PLL is planning to expand its Dahej 
terminal capacity to 17.5 MMTPA from present 15 MMTPA by 2019. M/s Shell is also planning to expand its capacity 
and increase to 5 MMTPA with the construction of break water facility. Though Kochi Terminal has been commissioned 
in September -2013, at present, the terminal is running at about 3.41% of its capacity.

ONGC  have  signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)  with New Mangalore Port Trust (NMPT), Mitsui and 
BPCL for carrying out feasibility study for setting up LNG regasification terminal at Mangalore. IOCL is setting up 5 
MMTPA  LNG  regasification  terminal  at  Ennore.  GAIL  and  IOCL  have  signed  separate  MoUs  with  Dhamra  LNG 
Terminal Pvt. Ltd. for booking of capacity in their proposed LNG terminal in Orissa. Andhra Pradesh Gas Distribution 
Corporation  (APGDC),  an  affiliate  company  of  GAIL  in  collaboration  with  the  Government  of  Andhra  Pradesh  is 
promoting setting up of a 3.5 MMTPA Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU) based LNG terminal in Kakinada. 
 
 
At present, the country is having about 15,000 km of natural gas pipeline infrastructure and an additional 15,000 km of 
pipeline is required for completion of National Gas Grid. Out of this additional 15,000 km, PNGRB/Government of 
India has authorized entities for laying of about 11,900 km of pipelines. About 1175 km of pipeline in respect of Ennore-
Bengaluru-Puducherry-Nagapattinam-Madurai-Tuticorin was pending for award due to court case pending before the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court. The said court case has been recently cleared paving the way for award of this section also. 
 
10.9  INPUTS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS 
 
As brought out in Para-10.1 above, substantial capacity addition is envisaged from renewables during 2017-22 and 2022-
27. MNRE was requested for working out the norms for estimation of various inputs for renewables projects based on 
solar, wind etc., their indigenous availability and issues involved in transportation of equipment etc. in consultation with 
the manufacturers of these equipment and would be made available by MNRE separately.  
 
10.10  LAND AND WATER FOR THERMAL STATIONS 
  
10.10.1  Land 
 
The land requirement for various configurations of thermal plants is being considered as per CEA Report “Review of 
Land Requirement for Thermal Power Station-2010” - the typical value for 2-unit combination of coal based station 
based on domestic coal varies from 1.11 to 0.929 Acres/ MW for 500MW unit to 800MW unit size and is approx. 0.55 
Acres/ MW for Coastal Stations based on Imported Coal.  The same has been concurred by the members. 
 
The 12th Plan working group on Power by the Planning Commission had identified the following major Issues of concern 
regarding land acquisition: -  
  Lack of land Records, Issues related to compensation -Lack of clarity about the status of occupiers who are 
not owners,  
  Right of Way (ROW) for Ash/Water pipelines, coal conveyors and transmission lines, Resistance from local 
people,  
  MOEF clearance and acquisition of forest land and Resettlement and rehabilitation of the Project Affected 
People (PAP). 
 
The working group had recommended the following for Land use and acquisition:  
  Minimizing land requirement pressure for new projects by use of spare land within existing plants. 
  Review of MoEF procedures for expeditious project clearances. 
  Higher capacity units in place of older small size units & Adoption of higher size units. 
  Shelf of sites for projects i.e. land bank needs to be created. 
  New technology options to be adopted for minimizing land requirement. 
  Land acquisition by States need to be done expeditiously in a time bound manner, considering that a large 
percentage of power is allocated / committed to the Home State from the power project.

           Central Electricity Authority 
 National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
As no additional capacity addition is envisaged from thermal projects during 2017-22, and also large thermal capacity 
is under construction, no major constraints are anticipated for thermal generation on account of land availability. Land 
for projects under construction and recently awarded would already have been tied up. 
 
 
However, issues faced in general by the utilities for land acquisition were discussed by the Sub-Committee and the major 
points emerged out of the discussions are as under: - 
  Different  types  of  land  acquisitions  are  involved  in  Power  plant  construction  viz.  Land  acquisition  in 
contiguous land for Main Plant, Township, Ash dyke, Reservoir etc. (Pvt/ Govt/Forest), Linear land acquisition 
mainly  for  Railway  corridor.  Approach  roads  etc  (Pvt/  Govt/Forest)  and  Right  of  Use/Right  of  Way 
(RoU/RoW) for Municipal water pipeline/Ash pipe/Transmission line corridors. 
  With  the  enactment  of  new  LARR  act,  apart  from  increase  in  input  costs,  the  process  is  getting  more 
complicated and lengthy now. Theoretically, almost 5 years are required for completion of LA process that 
includes Social Impact Assessment process/ consent of owners. The problem is more in linear acquisitions 
wherein number of PAPs and villages are more.  
For  NTPC’s  Greenfield  projects,  viz.  Gadarwara,  Kudgi,  Khargone,  Lara,  Meja,  NPGCL,  BRBCL,  etc., 
problems are being faced in acquisition of land for Railway Siding. The reasons include rate difference in 
the land acquired under old act / new act as awards for certain patches were declared under old act, finalization 
of R&R Plan, incomplete land records resulting to left out land in critical areas, etc. Active support of the state 
administration is essential for resolving such issues. A possible solution brought out by the members could be 
formation of JVs with Railways and land acquisition by Railways under the Railway Act.  
 
  While in general, acquisition of forest land is avoided by the utilities/NTPC,  difficulties are being faced in 
transfer of forest land mainly in linear acquisitions – Rail line corridor at Lara, Darlipalli projects of NTPC.  
The major problem faced in transfer of Govt land is GMK & GMA land and absence of pre-defined process 
of agreeable solution for eviction of Raiyatis. At times transfer of Govt land is becoming more difficult than 
acquisition of Private land. 
RoU (Right of Use) Act is available in MP, Chattisgarh, Bihar, Gujarat and Haryana. Due to absence of such 
act in Maharashtra, Karnataka, UP and Odisha difficulties have been faced in availability of land for laying of 
MuW pipelines in NTPC projects in respective states. – Solapur, Kudgi, Meja and Darlipalli.  Even in the 
states where RoU act is available difficulties have been faced in availability of land (mostly on account of 
owners’ demand of higher compensation) in BRBCL/ NPGCPL/Kanti/ Gadarwara projects of NTPC.  
 
 
 
10.10.2  Water 
 
As per Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 (Amendment 1998) issued by MOE&F, all thermal power plants, using 
water from rivers/lakes reservoirs, are required to install cooling towers irrespective of location and capacity. Thus all 
thermal stations are being provided by closed cycle cooling water (CCW) systems. 
 
Over the years, considerable technology improvements have been made to reduce water consumption in the stations  - 
the  consumptive  water  requirement  which  used  to  be  about  7m3/MWh  in  the  past,  has  been  optimized  by  various 
technological interventions & water conservation practices and has been brought down to 3m3/MWh. 
 
As  per  the  new  environmental  Regulations  issued  by  MOE&F  in  Dec-2015,  all  new  plants  to  be  installed  after  1st 
January, 2017 shall be required to meet specific water consumption upto maximum of 2.5 m3/MWh. In view of the 
necessity to install FGD system in the stations due to SOx emission limits prescribed in the new MOE&F Regulations, 
higher consumption water requirement of about 3 m3/MWh is estimated. 
 
The 12th Plan working group on Power by the Planning Commission had suggested for creation of large reservoirs/ 
dams  on  potential  rivers  to  retain  flood  waters  by  the  state  Govts./Ministry  of  water  resources  to  ease  water 
availability for the projects.

10.11  CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY 
 
The availability of construction machinery for project execution is generally considered adequate. However, as brought 
out earlier, contractors at times take works beyond their capacities and are not able to mobilize the resources and deploy 
adequate T&P items to meet the commissioning targets. In the above context, a suggestion has been made for creation 
of  a  mechanism  for  sharing  information  on  orders/work  load  on  various  contractors  and  availability  of  T&P 
items/construction machinery with them. 
 
 
Suggestions  were  also  sought  from  the  equipment  manufacturers  on  improvements  in  construction  machinery  and 
construction  practices  to  improve  the  pace  of  project  execution.    The  salient  issues  emerged  from  the  information 
provided by the manufacturers and deliberations held in the Sub-Committee are as under: - 
 
Better infrastructure for transportation and ODC movement could facilitate larger size sub-assemblies at shop, 
leading to reduction in execution time at sites. This would also require deployment of larger size cranes and 
handling equipment at site. For bigger modules, higher size cranes of about 1000 tons may be required at site. 
Better site infrastructure by the customer comprising of: - 
 
  Pre-assembly yards at site with dedicated T&P – permitting boiler contractor for fabrication at site 
could provide considerable reduction in the time of Construction. For this, an additional area of 70,000 
sq.m. would be required by the Contractor 
  Well compacted and motorable area for storage of material. 
  Hard crusting of Boiler cavity and surrounding area for Crane Marching 
  Advancement of underground portion of civil foundations in boiler area, depending upon Engineering 
and interface input 
 
Adoption of improved Construction Practices in Civil works like: -  
 
 Using concrete batching plants instead of concrete mixers  
  Tower Cranes and placer booms for concreting for standalone high rise buildings instead of concrete 
pumps  
 Automatic plastering machines 
  Rebar Processing Unit for Fabrication of Reinforcement Steel 
  Pre Engineered Buildings with tubular sections with pocketed foundations 
 
It is suggested that a Task Force may be created under NTPC with participation from equipment manufacturers/EPC 
contractors to examine the issue in detail and work out an optimized framework of site preparation, T&P requirements 
etc. for overall improvement in project execution. 
 
10.12 CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
The broad conclusions/recommendations for key inputs are as under: - 
  Adequate manufacturing facilities exist for main plant equipment– Lack or orders is a concern of all manufacturers.  
 
  Presently there are large imports of raw materials, castings/forgings, tubes/pipes of alloy steels, CRGO steel etc. 
for Boiler and Turbine generators. It is suggested that a joint mechanism may be created under Ministry of Steel 
with participation from power equipment manufacturers and steel manufacturers for more information sharing on 
compositions/properties of various steels and steel products required and their indigenous development by the steel 
industry. 
 
  Constraints  in  availability  of  good  BoP  systems  vendors  are  being  felt  as  many  of  the  good  Coal  Handling 
Plant/Ash handling plant vendors are not in good financial health.  Even the EPC agency normally sub-contracts 
BoP systems and thus availability of good BoP vendors is vital for all projects – both, EPC or separate package 
basis. In several cases BoP contract had to be terminated due to non-performance of the vendors. As BoP vendors

cater to material handling systems in other industries also, it is suggested that an organizational mechanism for 
information sharing on BoP vendors across industries needs to be considered.  Such a mechanism could provide 
the salient details on orders in hand, T&P available, past performance etc. This could be a web based portal under 
DHI or Ministry of commerce. 
 
 
  New  advanced  technologies  BoP  systems  like  High  Concentration  Slurry  Disposal  (HCSD)  type  ash  disposal 
systems,  closed  pipe  type  conveyors  for  coal  handling  plants  (CHP),  large  size  R.O  systems  also  need  to  be 
indigenized. The equipment manufacturers may back integrate as some of them also have their BoP or EPC setups 
or may undertake vendor developments. 
 
  ODC  movement  Continues  to  be  a  major  constraint;  though  MoRTH  have  placed  an  online  system  for  ODC 
approval, it is seen that substantial specific clearances are required in spite of this online system as large number 
of bridges – special bridges, bridges with span >50 m, distress bridges are not covered under online approval. Thus 
the suggestion of manufacturers towards adoption of standardized maximum axle weight of around 16 MT/axle 
with no approvals required thereafter, single window clearance system for ODCs or undertaking a National Bridge 
Up-gradation Programme for upgradation of all bridges to minimum strength facilitating ODC movements need to 
be considered to remove the constraints prevailing in ODC movements. 
 
 
Inland waterways can become an attractive mode of transportation in conjunction with Railways. The success of 
NTPC coal transportation to Farakka could be replicated across numerous other stations.  
 
  The prevailing regasification capacity for LNG in the country stands at about 21 Million metric tons per annum 
(MMTPA) – further expansions are being planned by several players. Also additional 15,000 km, of gas pipelines 
are under construction for completion of national Gas grid. 
 
  Future Infrastructure Project in Railway line, Port development will be done through PPP mode. 
 
  Suggestions  were  sought  from  the  equipment  manufacturers  on  improvements  in  construction  machinery  and 
construction practices to improve the pace of project execution. Several improved construction practices and pre-
requisites and corresponding infrastructural issues have been brought out by the manufacturers. It is suggested that 
a Task Force may be created under NTPC with participation from equipment manufacturers/EPC contractors and 
utilities to examine the issue in detail and work out an optimized framework of site preparation, T&P requirements 
etc. for overall improvement in project execution.

A  total  capacity  addition  of  58,384  MW  from  conventional  sources  has  been  envisaged  for  the  period  2017-2022, 
consisting of 47,855 MW of coal based power stations, 406 MW of gas based power stations, 6,823 MW of hydro power 
stations and 3,300 MW of nuclear stations. Besides this, there has been a big thrust by the Government of India for 
setting  up  renewable  power  generation  capacity  of  1,75,000  MW  by  the  year  2022,  out  of  which  1,17,756  MW  is 
expected to be set up during the period 2017-2022. The requirement of funds for generation projects for the period 2017-
2022  has  been  assessed,  based  on  the  above  mentioned  capacity  addition.  However,  it  may  be  mentioned  that  no 
additional fund will be required for gas based generation capacity as the construction of these plants has already been 
completed and could not be commissioned so far due to non-availability of domestic gas. 
 
To assess the fund requirement for various types of generation projects, the year-wise phasing of expenditure has been 
considered in accordance with the normal scenario. The cost per MW for the year 2017-18 has been estimated based on 
present day cost and this has further been escalated thereafter @4% per annum. However, in view of the recent trend, 
the capital cost per MW in case of solar, wind and biomass based power projects has been pegged at present day level 
without any escalation in subsequent years. The details of assumptions of capital cost per MW and year-wise phasing 
of  expenditure  of  different  categories  of  generation  projects  are  given  in  Annexure  11.1  and      Annexure  11.2 
respectively. 
 
 
Based on the above, the total fund requirement for the period 2017-2022 is estimated to be Rs.11,55,652 Crores, which 
also includes the likely expenditure during the period for the projects coming up in the year 2022-2027. Table 11.1 
below captures the year-wise details of total estimated fund requirement.

Out  of  the  fund  requirement  of  ₹  8,52,804  Crores  for  the  projects  likely  to  be  commissioned  during  2017-22,  it  is 
estimated that ₹ 1,42,566 Crores would be required for Central sector projects, ₹ 92,889 Crores would be required for 
State  sector  projects  and   ₹ 6,17,349  Crores  for Private  sector  projects.  In  this  estimation,  it  is  assumed  that  all  the 
Renewable projects will be implemented by private developers. 
 
11.2    FUND REQUIREMENT FOR THE PERIOD 2022-27 
 
The  fund  requirement  for  the  period 2022-27  has  been  estimated  based  on  total  capacity  addition  of  1,65,220  MW, 
consisting of 46,420 MW of thermal projects, 12,000 MW of hydro projects, 6,800 MW of nuclear projects and 1,00,000 
MW of renewable energy projects.  
 
The fund requirement for the period of 2022-27 has been assessed using same principles as that for 2017-22 viz. based 
on year wise phasing of expenditure under normal scenario and estimated capital cost per MW.  The latter has been 
arrived at based on estimated capital cost per MW for the year 2017-18 with annual escalation @4%. Nuclear units of 
1000 MW each based on Light Water Reactor (LWR) technology are expected during 2022-23 & 2023-24 and 2 units 
of 1000 MW on LWR in 2026-27. For these nuclear units, the cost per MW have been considered as ₹ 20 Crores for the 
year 2022-23 with an annual escalation @4% thereafter. As for the period 2017-22, the capital cost per MW for solar, 
wind and biomass based power projects in the period 2022-27 has been maintained at present day level without any 
escalation in the coming years. The details of assumptions of capital cost per MW and year-wise phasing of expenditure 
of different categories of generation projects are given in Annexure 11.1 and   Annexure 11.2 respectively. 
 
Based on the above, the total fund requirement for the period 2022-2027 has been estimated to be ₹ 9,56,214 Crores. In 
the absence of information about specific years of commissioning except nuclear projects, it is assumed that the capacity 
addition is equally spread out over each of the five years. In case of nuclear projects, units of 1000 MW each based on 
LWR technology have been considered during 2022-23 & 2023-24, 2 units of 700MW of PHWR have been considered 
in the year 2024-25, one unit of 700 MW PHWR in the year 2025-26 and one unit of 700 MW PHWR & 2 units of 1000 
MW LWR in 2026-27. This fund requirement does not include advance action for projects coming up during the period 
2027-2032.  
 
The mode-wise fund requirement for the period 2022-2027 (excluding the expenditure  likely to incurred during this 
period for the projects coming up in the year 2027-2032) is given in Table 11.3.

 SOURCES OF FUNDS 
 
In  case  of  Central  Sector  projects,  generally  developers  make  an  equity  contribution  of  30%.  In  case  of  projects 
developed in State Sector and Private sector, the equity contribution is generally 20% and 25% respectively. 
 
 
Based on the estimation of fund requirement for the period 2017-22 and considering sector-wise equity contribution 
mentioned in section 11.1, it is estimated that developers will be required to infuse equity amount totaling to ₹ 2,98,435 
Crores. Further, they will have to arrange for total debt of ₹  8,57,216 Crores.  
 
Similarly, the equity and debt requirement (excluding fund requirement for advance action for projects during the period 
2027-2032) for the period 2022-2027 have been estimated as ₹ 2,62,110 Crores and ₹ 6,94,104 Crores respectively. 
 
The  sources,  available  for  debt  funding  are  scheduled  commercial  banks,  financial  institutions  like  Power  Finance 
Corporation (PFC), Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), Bonds  - domestic as 
well as oversees, foreign currency loan from World Bank, ADB, KfW, EXIM Bank and also from foreign equipment 
manufacturers. It is also expected that funds including foreign funds from private players would also be invested through 
Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvIT).  The Subordinate Debt/grant from Government may also be available to some 
projects to be developed by PSU/States. 
 
In respect of nuclear power generation, Government budgetary support may be required for funding equity requirement 
for future power projects. Further, to promote the Renewable energy, Govt. of India is providing Viability Gap Funding 
(VGF)  from  National  Clean  Energy  and  Environment  Fund  (NCEEF)  and  is  also  arranging  low  cost  funds  from 
International Agencies like World Bank, ADB etc. Apart from this, IREDA is financing renewable energy projects under 
various schemes.

CHAPTER 12 
EMISSIONS FROM POWER SECTOR  
12.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
 
The phenomenal growth in demand for energy is increasingly affecting the natural environment. Human activities now 
occur on a scale that has started to interfere  with complex natural  systems.  Anthropogenic activities such as energy 
generation from fossil fuels, industrialization and deforestation have been increasing the atmospheric concentration of 
Green House Gases (GHGs) above their natural levels resulting in Global climatic change. Excessive concentration of 
Green House Gases like Carbon di-oxide (CO2) and Methane (CH4) and other harmful emissions in the atmosphere has 
become one of the most critical global environment issues by which human life is gravely threatened.  
 
In most of the developing countries, the major requirement of power is met through thermal power plants. India also 
depends largely on coal as a major source of energy for producing power and coal will continue to play a major role in 
producing power in near future. As on 31.03.2017, coal based power generation capacity is around 58.08 % of the total 
installed capacity but generates almost 76.08 % of total power generation in country. 
 
Generation of power by use of fossil fuel like coal, oil and gas   pollutes the atmosphere in many ways. Emission of 
particulate matter and generation of fly ash from coal based power stations are local health hazard. Gaseous emissions 
from fossil fuel based power generation like CO2, SOx, NOx and Mercury etc. affect the local as well as global climate.  
 
12.1 EMISSION FROM THERMAL POWER STATIONS 
 
Fossil fuel-fired power plants burn fossil fuels like coal, lignite, natural gas, diesel etc. to generate steam/ hot air to run 
turbines generating electricity. The generation of power from combustion of fossil fuels has an impact on Air, Water 
and Land resulting in degradation of local as well as global environment. 
The major types of pollutants emitted from thermal power stations are as follows: 
 
12.1.1 
Air Pollution 
 
 
The following major air pollutants are generated from combustion of fossil fuels by thermal power stations: i) Nitrogen 
oxide(NO2)  ii)  Sulphur  di-oxide  (SO2)  iii)  Green  House  Gases  like  CO2  iv)  Suspended  Particulate  Matter  (SPM)  v) 
Mercury Emissions. Traces of Carbon monoxide (CO) is also produced during the process of combustion.  The brief 
description of major pollutants and their effects are detailed below: 
 
12.1.1.1 Nitrogen Oxide 
 
Most  of  the  NOx  is  emitted  as  NO  which  is  oxidised  to  NO2  in  the  atmosphere.    All  combustion  processes  at  high 
temperature are sources of NOx emission. Formation of NOX may be due to thermal NOX which is the result of oxidation 
of nitrogen in the air or due to fuel NOX which is due to nitrogen present in the fuel.  In general, higher the combustion 
temperature the higher NOx is produced.  Some of NOx is oxidised to NO3, an essential ingredient of acid precipitation 
and fog.  There were no existing norms for control of NOx. However, new norms notified by Ministry of Environment, 
Forest and Climate Change has stipulated norms for NOx control, which are discussed later in the chapter.  
 
12.1.1.2 Sulphur Oxide 
 
The combustion of sulphur contained in the fossil fuels, especially coal and oil is the primary source of SOX.  About 
97% to 99% of SOX emitted from combustion sources is in the form of Sulphur Di-oxide which is a critical pollutant, 
the remainder is mostly SO3, which in the presence of atmospheric water is transformed into Sulphuric Acid at higher 
concentrations, produce delirious effects on the respiratory system. The SOx emissions are controlled by providing tall

height stack for dispersion.   Higher size units of 500 MW and above were also required to keep space provisions for 
future installation of Flue Gas de-sulphurisation (FGD) system when required. In specific cases, installation of FGD 
system has been stipulated by MOE&F while granting environmental clearance. The new norms notified by Ministry of 
Environment, Forest and Climate Change has stipulated emission norms for SOx which are discussed later in the chapter. 
 
 
12.1.1.3 Green House Gases 
 
A number of gases like CO2, Methane, nitrous oxide(N2O),  Chlorofluorocarbons and  water vapour are  called Green 
House Gases. Carbon dioxide is released primarily through the burning of fossil fuels. It is generated by combustion of 
coal and hydrocarbons. Methane is released through the decomposition of organic matter (marshes, cattle raising, rice 
flakes etc.) and the use of fossil fuels. 
 
12.1.1.4 Particulate Matter 
 
 
The  terms  particulate  matter,  particulates,  particles  are  used  interchangeably  and  all  refer  to  finely  divided  solids 
dispersed in the air through chimney or stack of power stations. Norms have been stipulated by Ministry of Environment, 
Forest and Climate Change for control of Suspended Particulate Matter and are more stringent for new power plants. 
 
12.1.1.5 Carbon Monoxide 
 
It is a colorless, odorless flammable and toxic gas. It has ability to react with hemoglobin in the blood and reduce the 
oxygen absorbing capacity of the blood.  It is generated by incomplete combustion of coal and hydrocarbons. The most 
significant source of CO is automobiles. 
 
12.1.1.6 Mercury Emissions 
 
Emissions of mercury from thermal power stations are a subject of increasing concern because of its toxicity, volatility, 
persistence, long range transport in the atmosphere. Once released into the environment, mercury contaminates soil, air, 
surface and ground water. The mercury emitted from coal-fired power plants originates from the mercury present in the 
coal. Typically, mercury is present in the coal in the tens of parts-per-billion range. Burning of enormous quantity of 
coal for power generation makes it the largest anthropogenic source of mercury emissions. 
 
12.1.2 Water Pollution 
 
Water pollution refers to contamination of natural water, whereby its further use is impaired. The contamination could 
be caused by the introduction of organic or inorganic substances in the water or due to change in the temperature of the 
water. 
 
In thermal power stations the source of water is river, lake, pond or sea from where water is usually taken.  There is 
possibility of water being contaminated from the source itself.  Further contamination or pollution could be added by 
the pollutants of thermal power plant waste as inorganic or organic compounds. 
 
The types of water pollution & its sources are given in Table 12.1.

All discharge from thermal power stations to water bodies is made after treatment as per the environmental standards 
prescribed by MOE&F. Further, ash ponds are High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) lined to prevent leaching etc. Also 
zero discharge system with no discharge to water body are envisaged at many stations. 
 
12.1.3 Fly Ash Generation 
 
Indian coal is of low grade with ash content of the order of 30%-50 % in comparison to imported coals which have low 
ash content of the order of 10%-15%. Large quantity of ash is thus being generated at coal/lignite based Thermal Power 
Stations in the country, which not only requires large area of precious land for its disposal but is also one of the sources

of pollution of both air and water. To reduce the requirement of land for disposal of fly ash in ash ponds and to address 
the problem of pollution caused by fly ash, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change has issued  various 
Notifications  on  fly  ash  utilization,  first  Notification  was  issued  on  14th  September,  1999  which  was  subsequently 
amended in 2003, 2009 and 2016 vide Notifications dated 27th August, 2003, 3rd November, 2009 and 25th January, 
2016 respectively.   The Notification of 3rd November, 2009 prescribes targets of Fly Ash utilization in a phased manner 
for all Coal/Lignite based Thermal Power Stations in the country so as to achieve 100% utilization of fly ash.  
The latest MoEF&CC’s Notification of 25th January, 2016 stipulates mandatory use of fly ash based products in all 
Government  schemes  or  programmes  e.g.  Pradhan  Mantri  Gramin  Sadak  Yojana,  Mahatma  Gandhi  National  Rural 
Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, etc. 
 
 
12.1.4 Land Degradation  
 
The  thermal power  stations are  generally  located on the  non-forest land and do not involve  much  Resettlement and 
Rehabilitation problems. However, it's effects due to stack emission etc., on flora and fauna, wild life sanctuaries and 
human life etc. have to be studied for any adverse effects. One of the serious effects of thermal power stations is land 
requirement for ash disposal and hazardous elements’ percolation to ground water through ash disposal in ash ponds. 
 
12.2  STEPS  TAKEN  BY  THERMAL  POWER  STATIONS  TO  REDUCE  EMISSIONS  FROM  POWER 
PLANTS 
 
Following steps are presently being taken by power utilities to reduce the pollution from thermal power stations: - 
 
SPM Emissions: - High Efficiency Electrostatics Precipitators (ESP) are installed in the power station 
to arrest fly ash and reduce suspended particulate matter within the prescribed emissions norms. A 
SPM norm stipulated by MOEF& CC are generally adhered to by coal based power stations. However, 
depending upon the local condition, Pollution Control Board or other implementing agencies within 
the provision of Environment Protection Act has stiputed more stringent norms. 
NOx  Control.:-  Low  NOX  burners  are  being  used  in  the  power  station  for  NOx  control  through 
primary  combustion  control.    The  existing  NOx  emissions  from  coal  based  power  station  without 
having any secondary NOx control system is in the range of 600-1000mg/Nm3. 
SOx control – Indian coal used in the thermal power station generally has low sulphur content about 
0.3% to 0.5% and SOx control is being achieved through dispersion from tall stacks provided as per 
the Regulations prescribed.  In coal based units of 500MW and above and also at stations with capacity 
of  1500  to  2000MW,  space  provisions  are  required  to  be  kept  for  installation  of  Flue  Gas 
Desulfurization (FGD), if required, in future.  In sensitive areas, the installation of FGD plants may 
be insisted upon by MOEF&CC even for station with smaller capacity.  Flue gas desulphurization 
systems have been installed in few stations; wherever prescribed by the MOEF&CC. 
 
 
  Liquid Effluent Discharge: - Effluent Treatment Plant is being installed to control parameters like 
pH,  Free  available  Chlorine  Suspended  solids,  Oil  &  Grease,  Copper,  Iron,  Zinc,  TDS  &  Total 
Suspended Solids. Many power stations have achieved zero liquid discharge. Most of the power plants 
are adhering to the norms stiputed. 
  Fly  Ash  Utilization:  -  The  steps  have  been  taken  by  Thermal  Power  Stations  to  ensure  100% 
utilization of ash generated by them. The Fly ash collected in the dry form is being used for brick 
making, coal mines backfilling, road construction and cement manufacturing. Data of 151 coal based 
thermal  stations,  with  an  Installed  capacity  of  145044.80  MW,  consuming  coal  of  536.64  Million 
tonnes  and  generating  Fly  Ash  of  176.74  Million  tonnes  were  analysed  in  2015-16  by  CEA.  The 
analysis shows that country has achieved Fly Ash Utilization of 107.77 Million tonnes with percentage 
utilization of 60.97 % (However, the actual utilization of fly ash may vary from station to station).  
Fly ash utilisation in various sectors are shown in Exhibit 12.1.

  Mercury emissions:  
India  has  signed  Minimata  convention  on  legally  binding  instrument  to  protect  human  health  & 
environment  from  adverse  effects  of  Mercury  in  September  2014.  Article  8  of  the  Minimata 
convention pertains to reducing  mercury emissions to the  atmosphere  through  measures to control 
mercury emissions from coal based power stations. The studies carried out by CIMFR, Dhanbad on 
mercury  content  in  Indian  coal  has  estimated  mercury  emission  factor  of  coal  as  0.14  g/tonne  or 
14ppm.  Control systems provided for NOx and SOx (SCR and FGD) along with ESP also offer the 
co-benefit of mercury emissions control.  
 
12.3 NEW EMISSION STANDARDS FOR THERMAL POWER PLANTS  
MOEF&CC has notified new Environment norms for Thermal power station including Emission and Effluent discharge 
on 7th December,2015.  The Table 12.3 and 12.4 show the new environmental norms for thermal power stations which 
are to be complied at different time schedule.

12.4 IMPLICATIONS OF NEW EMISSION STANDARDS ON POWER SECTOR 
 
The new norms stipulated by MOEF & CC cannot be met until new technologies like Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGDs) 
for SOx reduction and Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCRs) for NOx reductions are introduced.

The following technologies are available to reduce SOx emissions from coal based power stations: 
1)  Wet /Lime Stone Flue Gas Desulfurization 
2)  Spray Dry Scrubber 
3)  Sea Water Scrubbing 
 
 
The following technologies are available to reduce NOx emissions from coal based power stations: 
1)  Combustion control 
2)  Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR) 
3)  Selective Non Catalyst Reduction (SNCR) 
 
To meet the new norms for SOx and NOX reduction, coal based power stations will face lot of challenges. Some of the 
issues and challenges are discussed below. 
 
For implementing SOx reduction, coal based power stations have to install flue gas desulfurization plants. It is estimated 
that around 16,789 MW of the coal based capacity will be affected due to non-availability of space for installing FGD 
plant.  A land of 7 acres is required to install FGD plant for a plant of 2×500 MW. Also where space is available, FGD 
installation may require 2- 3 years for installation and involve a shutdown of at least 1-2 months.  In addition to this, for 
an installed capacity of around 2 lakh MW, a large amount of limestone will be needed for operating FGD plants. The 
by-product of FGD plants is  Gypsum.  So the disposal of  such large quantity of Gypsum  will be an added problem. 
Installing of FGD plant shall increase the Auxiliary Power Consumption (APC) by at least 1% – 1.5 % affecting the 
overall Efficiency of the power plant. 
For  implementing  NOx  control,  coal  based  power  stations  have  to  install  Selective  Catalytic  Reduction  (SCR)  as 
combustion control system may reduce the NOx emissions to around 600-700 mg/NM3 only. However, in view of the 
new norms of 300 mg/NM3, installation of SCR becomes must. The main challenge with SCR is that they have not been 
proven for high ash Indian Coal. Also space constraint/layout constraints is also expected to be a major challenge for 
installation  of  SCR.  Also  for  operating  SCR,  large  amount  of  Ammonia  will  be  required  involving  challenges  in 
transportation and storage of Ammonia due its toxic nature.  
Apart from all the issues and challenges, availability of vendors to supply FGD and SCR in such a large quantity will 
be the main constraint. 
 
12.5 CARBON EMISSIONS FROM POWER SECTOR 
 
The world over consumption of fossil fuel is the primary contributing factor in the build-up of atmospheric concentration 
of GHGs like carbon dioxide resulting in Global warming. As per UN Human Development Report 2015, the per capita 
carbon dioxide emission in India is among the lowest and is estimated to be around 1.7 metric tonnes as compared to 
the world average of 4.6 tonnes per capita and 17.0 tonnes per capita for USA (Table 12.5).

About  half  of  total  carbon  dioxide  from  India  is  estimated  to  be  generated  from  power  sector.  The  other  major 
contributors of CO2 emission in our country are transport and industrial sector. CEA is annually estimating the amount 
of CO2 emissions from grid connected power stations. The total amount of CO2 emission from grid connected power 
stations  in  the  year  2015-16 has  been  estimated  at  846.3 million  tonnes.  Year  wise  carbon  di-oxide  emissions  from 
Indian power sector during the last 5 years are given in Table 12.6.

In the year 2015-16, the weighted average CO2 emission rate from grid connected power stations (excluding captive 
power  stations  and  stations  on  islands  and  from  Renewables)  is  0.82  kgCO2/kWhnet.  During  the  year  2015-16,  the 
weighted average has increased marginally due to the increase in percentage of coal-based generation and decrease in 
hydro and gas based generation. Year wise weightage average emission factors are shown in Exhibit 12.2.

The weighted average emission rate of coal and lignite based generation is 0.99 kg CO2/ kWhnet and 1.36 kg CO2/ kWhnet 
respectively during the year 2015-16. However, the average emission rate from coal based stations has been on declining 
trend due to the fact that more number of efficient supercritical technology based units are getting commissioned and 
also due to introduction of Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme which aims at improving the efficiency of power 
plants.

12.6  IMPACT  ON  CO2  EMISSIONS  DUE  TO  CAPACITY  ADDITION  FROM  SUPERCRITICAL 
TECHNOLOGY BASED COAL POWER STATIONS. 
 
With the rapidly expanding thermal generation capacity, installation of large size supercritical units is being encouraged 
to enhance efficiency of power generation, reduce coal consumption and GHG emissions. Supercritical technology based 
units have about 2% more efficiency than sub critical technology based power plants. The country is going ahead with 
installing  Supercritical  technology  based  units  in  recent  time.  As  on  31st  March,  2017,  60  No.  of  units  based  on 
Supercritical technology have already been commissioned.  
An Analysis has been carried out to estimate reduction of quantum of amount of CO2 emissions by installing supercritical 
units in the country by 31st March,2017. It shows that about 20.69 Million tonnes of CO2 emissions have been avoided 
due to commissioning of Supercritical technology based units assuming that business as usual scenario would have been 
commissioning of sub critical technology based units.  
Details of the analysis is given in Table 12.8.

12.7 IMPACT ON CO2 EMISSIONS DUE TO HUGE CAPACITY ADDITION FROM RENEWABLE 
ENERGY SOURCES. 
Government  of  India  has  announced  a  huge  capacity  addition  from  renewable  energy  sources  by  the  year  2021-22. 
Target installed capacity of renewable energy  sources is set at 1,75,000 MW by the end of the  year 2021-22  which 
includes 1,00,000 MW capacity from solar and 60,000 MW from  wind, 15,000 MW from small hydro and biomass 
based power generation. 
Based  on  the  projections  of  capacity  addition  by  2021-22  given  by  Ministry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy,  it  is 
estimated that a generation of about 327 BU will be available from renewable energy sources.  Assuming the present 
weighted average emission rate of 0.82 kgCO2/KWh of Indian Grid, it is estimated that about 268 Million tonnes of CO2 
will be avoided annually by the end of 2021-22 from renewable energy sources. However, the net reduction of CO2 
emissions will be less as emissions from thermal power stations will increase due to frequent cycling and ramping of 
the plants than during steady state operation. 
12.8 PROJECTIONS OF CARBON EMISSIONS IN 2021-22 AND 2026-27 
On the basis of generation from each fuel source including renewables, carbon footprint i.e. projected carbon emissions 
and the emission factors considering base year of 2015-16 have been worked out.  
Emissions factors (gCO2/MJ) as given for Indian Coal/Lignite in the Initial National Communication and for Imported 
Coal  Gas/Oil/Diesel/Naphtha  as  given  by  Inter  Government  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC  2006)  have  been 
considered for estimating Carbon emissions from various fuels. The methodology as given in CO2 Baseline Database 
for the Indian Power Sector User Guide published annually by CEA has been followed in arriving the carbon emissions. 
Also, it is assumed that 75% of the coal generation will come from subcritical units and remaining from supercritical 
units in the year 2021-22. Further in the year 2026-27, it is assumed that 60% of the coal generation will come from 
subcritical units and remaining from supercritical units.   
The total CO2 emissions projected will increase from 846 Million tonnes in 2015-16 to 1026 Million tonnes in the year 
2021-22 and 1173 Million tonnes in 2026-27 and are shown in Exhibit 12.4.

12.9 INITIATIVE OF GOVERNMENT OF INDIA TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS  
 
Mitigation  of  CO2  emission  is  an  important  agenda  on  international  level.    Improving  efficiency  of  thermal  power 
stations is one of the effective methods to reduce CO2 emissions which is being achieved by various schemes introduced 
by Government of India like Perform Achieve and Trade Scheme under National Mission on Energy Efficiency and 
adopting super critical/ultra-super critical technology for coal based generation. Also efficiency improvement measures

through Renovation and Modernization (R&M) of old and inefficient units is undertaken and units in which R&M is not 
possible are being considered for retirement. Thrust is being given for increasing the share of non-fossil fuel (renewable, 
hydro etc.) based generation in the energy-mix to reduce the CO2 emissions from power sector. 
 
 
12.10 COUNTRY’S STAND ON CLIMATE CHANGE- INDCs 
Under the Copenhagen Accord, India had pledged to reduce its CO2 intensity (emissions per GDP) by 20 to 25 percent 
by  2020  compared  to  2005  levels.  Also  in  October,2015,  India  had  submitted  its  Intended  Nationally  Determined 
Contribution (INDC) to UNFCCC.  The key elements are: 
  To reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33% to 35 % by 2030 from 2005 level. 
  To achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy 
resources  by  2030,  with  the  help  of  transfer  of  technology  and  low  cost  international  finance  including  from 
Green Climate Fund (GCF). 
  To create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and 
tree cover by 2030. 
The studies show that the proposed trajectory of capacity addition programme for 2017-22 and 2022-27 is in line with 
India’s submissions under INDCs. An analysis has been carried out and details are shown below. 
12.10.1  Installed Capacity  
As on 31st March,2017, share of non-fossil fuel based capacity (Hydro + Nuclear + RES) in the total installed capacity 
of the country is around 33 %. It is expected that the share of non-fossil based capacity will increase to 49.3% by the 
end of 2021-22 and will further increase to 57.4 % by the end of 2026-27. Details of expected installed capacity and % 
share is shown in Table 12.9.

CHAPTER 13 
R&D ACTIVITIES IN POWER SECTOR  
13.0 INTRODUCTION 
Research and Development in power sector of India is managed under Ministry of Power through three schemes namely 
In-house Research and Development (IHRD) of CPRI, Research Scheme on Power (RSoP) and R&D under National 
Perspective  Plan  (NPP).  R&D  is  also  undertaken  by  various  ministries  like  MNRE,  Department  of  Science  & 
Technology,  R&D  laboratories  of  CSIR  ,  Academia  (IITs, NITs  and  Engineering  Colleges)  and  by  CPSU’s  BHEL, 
NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, POWERGRID.   Private sector companies, global R&D centers, etc also pursue it significantly. 
Many technological aspects, which are proposed for adoption in the country, are new from the perspective of Indian 
Power  Sector.  This  includes  the  large  capacities  of  superconducting  generators,  High  Temperature  Superconducting 
(HTS)  power  apparatus,  Ultra/Extra  high  voltage  transmission  lines  and  its  connected  equipment,  Gas  Insulated 
Substation (GIS) as well as smart metering in distribution systems.  
 
R&D activities and infrastructure developed by CPSUs, CPRI and MNRE during 12th plan were reviewed and projects 
which are important but could not be taken up under 12th plan are proposed for consideration during the year 2017-22. 
The following new developments have taken place in the last decade: 
  Adoption  of  Supercritical  technologies  for  thermal  generation  with  large  units  of  660  MW  and  800  MW 
capacity. 
  Technology for Ultra High Voltage transmission of 800 kV DC, 1200 kV AC have been adopted. Some of the 
transmission lines of 1200 kV AC are in the process of being commissioned. 
  There has been a greater emphasis on renewable sources of energy and Government of India has set a target of 
175 GW generation capacity by 2022 consist of 100 GW from solar 60 GW from wind and 15 GW from small 
hydro and other renewable sources of energy. These developments have given rise to new challenges and issues 
in the power sector.  Some of these include: 
o 
o 
o  Transmission corridor for evacuation of power generated from renewable sources 
o  Microgrid and electricity solutions for remote isolated areas. 
o  Adoption of micro grids and smart grids particularly in relation to efficiency of operation as well as 
to deal with the consumer related issues is very crucial for further development of Indian Power Sector. 
The adoption of large capacity generating units and high voltage transmission lines necessitated the 
adoption of state-of-the-art technology of high capacity transformers as well as grid safety, security 
and energy conservation.  
Integration of renewable energy generating sources with the Grid. 
Impact of renewable energy generation on the existing and new coal fed generating stations. 
13.1 R&D CHALLENGES DURING 2017-22 AND BEYOND 
It is a known fact that technology can help in enhancing supply of energy at affordable price and deliver it efficiently, 
sustainably and reliably. The supply should be reliable with high degree of availability. However, the real challenge lies 
in creation of a conducive environment for R&D to flourish. The country so far has been in the fore front of technology 
deployment but not in development. Hence, a proactive policy approach for technology induction must be in place.  
 The in-house R&D arms of major CPSUs like NTPC, NHPC and POWERGRID aim at introduction and absorption of 
new technology by applied research primarily through project routes. Major manufacturers like BHEL, ABB, GE etc., 
have their own R&D set up, focusing on product development. Central Power Research Institute (CPRI) is provided 
with capital funds from the Ministry of Power for in-house research as well as funds to coordinate and manage MoP’s 
research  schemes.  Central  Electricity  Authority  (CEA)  has  to  promote  research  in  matters  affecting  the  generation, 
transmission, distribution and trading of electricity. The policy of the Government is to promote R&D projects which 
would help the nation to become self-reliant in technology. 
Funds are also earmarked under different schemes including the Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyothi Yojana (DDUGJY) 
for enabling investigations and technology development. 
Research  and  Development  in  power  sector  and  consequent  changes  have  resulted  in  the  development  of  a  sound 
generation base, a reliable grid and a modern distribution system. Continued and sustained efforts are required through 
 R & D ACTIVITIES IN POWER SECTOR

involvement of various science and technology laboratories like that of CPRI, CSIR, DRDO, BARC and cooperation 
from Government bodies like DST, DSIR and MNRE, for promoting technology in India. 
In  the  present  scenario,  it  is  proposed  to  categorize  R&D  initiatives  into  five  different  conventional  sectors,  viz. 
Generation, Transmission, Distribution, Environment and Renewables including Microgrid. 
 
R&D  is  a  continuous  activity.  Integration  of  several  technologies  with  techno-economic,  statutory  compliance  and 
environmental considerations to be achieved over  a long term scenario also plays role in deployment of a particular 
technology. Utilities work in competitive and regulated environment and adoption of technology depends on that also. 
13.2 R&D INITIATIVES OF GENERATION SECTOR  
The major challenge to the energy and power sector is to reduce and ultimately eliminate generation shortfall, to provide 
a reliable and cost-effective power supply to the customers, and to achieve it in a sustainable manner with minimum 
impact on the environment.   
Generation sector is in the midst of a paradigm shift – one which has never been seen before in India. Moreover, the 
renewable energy plants have been classified as ‘must run’ plants. Also, most of the fossil fired plants are forced to 
operate at part load for sustained period. We have also moved progressively from coal shortage era to imported coal 
regime and now to coal surplus period. All these indicate that we are at the cusp of a new age where India will have to 
devise  technologies  and  strategies  to  extract  maximum  benefit  from  renewable  as  well  as  conventional  plants  in  a 
sustainable manner. 
Though  solar,  wind  and  other  sources  of  renewable  energy  have  recently  received  much  publicity;  still  the  role  of 
conventional generation continues to be critical. Solar and wind power are distributed sources which cannot be built at 
very high capacity levels or be centrally controlled. Moreover, they are dependent on weather conditions like wind levels 
and solar insolation, and so they may be unavailable for certain periods at a stretch and during this period, dependence 
would be exclusively on conventional power generating sources. Hence, huge opportunities to improve the generation 
system, including the aspects like better plant design, increasing efficiency, improvement in fuel quality and waste heat 
recovery system exist. The following are different technologies with proposed prototypes and pilot plant demonstration 
for implementation: 
 
13.2.1 Thermal Generation 
Some of the important areas of R&D in Thermal generation are identified for collaborative R&D. 
13.2.1.1  Ultra Super Critical (USC) and Advanced- USC Plants 
Ultra super-critical plants operate at higher temperature and pressure (approximately 600°C and 32 MPa) resulting in 
higher efficiency. These plants require low coal usage per kWh of electricity generated and have less CO2 emissions. A 
few  such plants  have been built in Europe and Japan. The  efficiency of these plants goes up to 44%. However, the 
extreme operating parameters impose stringent requirements on materials.  
Considering that coal shall remain as the  mainstay of India's power industry and the inevitability of global pressure, 
India should seriously focus to reduce emissions due to its own as well as global climate concerns. Development of 
Advanced Ultra Supercritical (Adv-USC) Technology for power plants has been taken as one of the four Sub-Missions 
as part of the National Mission under the guidance of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India.  Under 
this  initiative,  it  is  proposed  to  develop  and  establish  800  MW  Adv-USC  Power  Plant  on  a  Mission  Mode,  as  a 
collaborative project involving Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), NTPC, BHEL and CPRI. Material 
degradation issues and condition assessment programmes are also to be investigated. 
Research to increase the steam parameter to 700°C from the level of 600°C and to increase the efficiency levels beyond 
40% needs to be explored. The research in this area for the development of suitable materials to handle high temperature 
is already being coordinated by Government of India with the participation from BHEL, Nuclear Power Corporation 
Limited (NPCIL) and few experts in the country. 
 
13.2.1.2  IGCC Technology 
 R & D ACTIVITIES IN POWER SECTOR                                
 
 
13. 2 
           Central Electricity Authority 
  National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) integrates a coal gasifier, a gas clean up system and gas turbine in a 
combined  cycle  mode  where  coal  is  gasified  with  either  oxygen  or  air.  The  resulting  synthesized  gas  (or  syngas) 
consisting of primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide is cooled, cleaned and fired in a gas turbine. The technology has 
shown capability of power generation at higher efficiency and lower emission levels with respect to pulverized coal 
combustion technologies as demonstrated in the USA, Netherland and Spain.  
 
The  other  important  aspect  of  IGCC  where  technological  advances  are  continuously  made  is  the  syngas  cleaning 
especially at higher temperature. This removes the efficiency penalty of cooling the syngas to ~90ºC and again heating 
it to the required temperature for the gas turbine. These demonstration plants should have sufficient slip stream facilities 
where the upcoming warm gas cleaning technologies can be tested at actual operating condition. 
Furthermore,  IGCC  technology  opens  up  new  product  area  along  with  electricity  generation  like liquid fuel 
generation, hydrogen production,  pre-combustion CO2 capture and integration of  fuel  cell which may provide future 
options of zero emission coal technologies with higher efficiency. There is a need to continue funding of such research 
with active participation of NTPC, BHEL and the leading State generation utilities.   
13.2.1.3  Waste Heat Recovery Systems for enhancing the power plant efficiency. 
The thermal power plants operating on Rankine power cycle normally achieve power generation efficiency in the range 
of 35–40% depending on various site conditions, turbine  inlet  steam conditions and design of equipment etc. Balance 
of the  heat input is essentially lost as condenser losses (about 48–50%)  and boiler exhaust  gas losses (about 6–7%) 
besides other nominal losses viz. radiation losses, un-burnt carbon losses etc. In a 500 MW unit, about 25 MW of thermal 
heat would be available if the flue gas temperature is dropped, say, from 140°C to 110°C. The major challenge in low 
temperature heat recovery system is the requirement of large heat transfer area and thus additional pressure drops, which 
increases the cost of the system. Use of waste heat recovery system, though desired for obvious cost benefits, is equally 
important for environmental protection since lower quantity of fossil fuels shall be burnt for same quantum of useful 
energy.  
Efforts  are  being  made  in  developing  technologies  where  waste  heat  can  be  gainfully  recovered  and  applied  to:  (i) 
Produce  refrigeration  /  air-conditioning  using  Vapor  Absorption/Adsorption  Machines  based  on  Li–Br,  Ammonia 
absorption  system.  (ii)  Plant  cycle  efficiency  improvement  using  condensate  pre-heating  and  fuel  oil  heating  (iii) 
Produce electric power independent of the main plant Turbine  – Generator (TG) set using Aqua-Ammonia Cycle or 
Organic Rankine Cycle. (iv) Flue Gas Desalination of sea water (v) Flue Gas Cooling Tower Blow down recovery. 
13.2.1.4  Bulk ash utilization 
Coal-based thermal power plants have been a major source of power generation in India where about 61% of the total 
power obtained is from coal-based thermal power plants (on installed capacity basis). Fly Ash is a by-product material 
being generated by thermal power plants from combustion of Pulverized coal. High ash content is found to be in range 
of 30% to 50% in Indian coal. So far several uses of fly ash have been developed viz. substitute of cement in concrete, 
land filling, mine filling, agriculture, etc. Practically fly ash consists of all the elements present in soil except organic 
carbon and nitrogen. Thus, it has a great potential material with manifold advantages in agriculture. Research needs to 
be carried out in developing technologies for bulk utilizations of fly ash in other areas such as construction of roads, 
bricks etc.  
13.2.1.5  Advanced surface engineering technologies for higher life expectancy of Thermal plant components 
The surface engineering technologies are becoming essential in critical applications of power plants involving erosion 
as well as corrosion. Thus the immediate technological requirements to be addressed in respect of damage tolerance 
capacity of materials are: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
High temperature wear and erosion resistance of thermal components (Burner, liner, and shield). 
Silt erosion resistance of hydro parts.  
Cavitation problem in hydro turbines. 
The other important investigations needed include the following:

Transmission towers and conductors play major role in power transfer. To meet the growing demand for power in urban 
and  industrial  areas  requires  transfer  of  huge  quantum  of  power.  Due  to  the  constraints  in  getting  environmental 
clearances, and acquiring Right of Way (RoW), introduction of compact transmission lines is an alternative choice. The 
compact  transmission  lines  have  the  advantage  of  reduced  RoW  and  reduced  tower  dimensions.  The  compact  lines 
invariably require polymer or long rod insulators for effecting reduced dimensions of tower. Reconductoring of existing 
lines  with  High  temperature  Low sag (HTLS) conductor is a viable option to  increase the power  transfer capacity. 
Design aspects of compact towers and feasibility study of different types of HTLS conductors are  to be explored for 
implementation. 
 
Compact transmission line support using FRP is gaining importance and adopting compact transmission lines in Indian 
power network has become essential due to increase in load growth and difficulty  in  building  new  lines  due  to  RoW 
issues.  The  main  features  of  compact  lines  are  reduced RoW and tower dimensions. The compact lines have reduced 
clearances and require polymer or long rod insulators for effecting tower dimensions. The aspects need to be addressed 
are: design, development  and  testing  of  220 kV  and  400 kV  towers  and  implementation  in  a  utility  as  a  pilot 
project. 
Keeping  in  view  the  bulk  power  transfer  requirement  development  of  high  temperature  electrical  conductors  for 
transmission  lines  is  essential.  The  major  challenges  are  to  overcome  the  transmission  losses,  increase  the  power 
transmission  on  the  existing  lines  and  the  development  of  more  efficient  power  conductors  for  new  lines.  The 
development of efficient power transmission system seems to have the major stake in the future of transmission system 
and will become the national priority. One of the major requirements of conductors is to have high ampacity and low 
sag properties. In this direction, high temperature conductors which can withstand temperatures well above 250 °C  are 
required to meet the growing demand to transfer power. 
Recent developments have demonstrated that ‘6201’ and ‘Al59’ are the two major alloy conductors in use. However, 
further enhancement is possible by designing new alloys and economically viable processing techniques. The present 
alloy conductors use alloying elements such as Zirconium (Zr) to restrict the re-crystallization temperatures of the alloy 
conductors so that the conductor can withstand high temperatures. The strength and conductivity of conductors need to 
have a best compromise so as to get the maximizing benefit during power transmission. Research in developing high 
temperature  All  Aluminium  Alloy  Conductors (AAAC)  for  transmission  and  distribution  line  applications  is  needed 
specially  for  developing  new  materials  for  this  purpose.  The  high  temperature  conductor  should  have  an  allowable 
temperature of 300°C in emergency condition and 250-260 °C in continuous operation. 
Design  and  development  of  seismic  resistant  substation  is  necessary  to  maintain  reliability  and  safety  of  electrical 
equipment  after  an  earthquake.  This  depends  on  the  seismic  response  of  individual  substation  components  such  as 
transformer, bushings,  switchgear  etc. The use of seismic qualification of electric equipment  is one of the most cost 
effective methods for reducing the damage and disruptions from earthquake. Thus, equipment and supporting structures 
for power generating stations,  and substations located in seismically sensitive regions / zones have to  be designed and 
standardized to withstand possible earthquakes. 
13.3.2 UHV DC +/- 800 kV 
Considering the implementation of next High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission at +/- 800 kV, indigenous 
manufacture of equipment is required. The research focus will cover the following aspects: (1) DC electric field, corona 
studies  on  equipment  and  electrodes;  (2)  Effect  of  pollution  on  insulator  surface;  selection  of  insulator  profile, 
configuration  to  withstand  DC  stress  under normal  and polluted conditions.  (3)  Performance  of  bushings  under  DC 
electric  stress.  (4)  Effects  of  DC  stress  on  transformer  insulation,  ageing  studies,  diagnostic  tools  (5)  Overhead 
transmission Lines (6) Bushings and transformers.  
Some of the other potential areas of research are as follows:  
Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based  HVDC transmission  has become an attractive option for bulk power transfer 
between meshed grids. The advantages of VSC based HVDC transmission is: high controllability of active and reactive 
power  at  the  converters  terminal  and  the  ability  to  improve  the  system  stability.  The  project  envisages  design, 
development and deployment of 50 MW VSC based back-to-back HVDC system, as a pilot project study.

High Speed Grounding Switches (HSGS) for HVDC systems are required to connect the station neutral to the station 
ground in case the ground electrode path becomes  isolated.   The development of indigenous HSGS will be carried out 
as a pilot project study for installation at HVDC substation. 
 
The  concept  of  transformer  less  HVDC  transmission  is  under  active  research  at  various institutions. A pilot project 
study is proposed to evaluate various aspects. 
To adopt the VSC based HVDC transmission technology, High Speed Grounding Switches for HVDC systems and to 
absorb the concept of transformer less HVDC transmission system in power sector, pilot project study is required to be 
undertaken to gain the experience for wider acceptability and implementation. 
13.3.3 Design and development of equipment for 1200 kV UHV AC System 
Power  sector  growth  necessitates  development  of  indigenous  technology  for  absorption  in  to  the  network  at  higher 
voltage levels,  mainly  to  strengthen  the  system  and  power  evacuation.  The  key equipment  proposed  for  indigenous 
development are: 1200 kV sub-station, circuit breakers, shunt reactors and controlled shunt reactors for dynamic reactive 
power compensation. Development of High Energy ZnO blocks for lightning arrestor is required for dissipation of high 
energy. Development of operating mechanism for 1200 kV disconnector is essential in the light of UHV transmission 
system technology.  
13.3.4 HVDC and FACTS  
Efforts are needed for better utilization of the facilities that have been installed in recent years. System studies will be 
useful to evaluate the cost-benefit trade-offs for further use of these devices. 
The key technologies that are being considered for development of controls, for EHV and UHV AC and DC transmission 
systems  are,  compact  towers  that  significantly  reduce  RoW  requirements,  application  of  High  Temperature 
Superconducting  technology  in  developing  transformers,  cables, fault current limiters,  motors  etc., Gas  Insulated 
Substations that require about 80% less area than conventional substations, substation automation and remote operation 
systems. 
The technical developments in communication technology and measurement synchronization for reliable voltage Phasor 
measurements  have  made  the  design  of  system  wide  protection  solution  possible.    The  introduction  of  Phasor 
Measurement Units (PMU) has greatly improved the observability of power system dynamics. Based on PMU’s input, 
different kinds of Wide Area Protection, emergency control and optimization systems can be designed. 
Additionally,  Smart  Grids  to  support  utilities  in  making  optimal  usage  of  the  transmission  grid  capacity  and  to 
prevent the spreading  of disturbances are also being  considered.  By  providing  on-line information  on  stability  and 
safety  margins  for  dynamic  condition  monitoring,  Smart  Grids  would serve as an early warning system in case of 
potential power system disturbances. 
13.3.5 Development of controllers for FACTS devices 
Application  of  Flexible  Alternating  Current  Transmission  System  (FACTS)  devices  in  Indian  p ower  system  is 
proposed,  extensively  supported  through  system  studies.  Research  in  the  direction  of  developing  indigenous 
development  of  FACTS  devices  and  its  controls  are  essential  and  the  objective  is  to  design  &  develop  controls  for 
FACTS devices such as: Static Compensator, HVDC, multi-terminal HVDC, switchable shunt reactors, series and shunt 
HVDC  taps,  Unified  Power  Flow  Controller  (UPFC),  Interline-Power-Flow-Controller  (IPFC)  &  Static  Synchronous 
Compensator (STATCOM) and deployment in network. The controller performance is to be studied in real time. 
There  is  a  need  to  develop  controller  for  controlled  switching  of  circuit  breakers, which is used to close or open 
the contacts of circuit breaker by time dependent control  of trip coils, to eliminate undesirable transients. Substantial 
research in this direction is required.

13.3.6 Automation 
A pilot project may be taken up  considering the advantages of process bus technology over the conventional station bus 
technology. Process bus technology has the advantage of reduced copper wiring, integration of any number of Intelligent 
Electronic Devices (IEDs) at bay level etc. Integration of optical current transformers (CTs) in place of conventional 
current transformer is also to be considered.   
 
13.3.7 Innovative visualization with sustainable self-awareness feature 
The  perspective  of  the  real  time  data  set  at  different  levels  is  required  for  different  aspects.  It  is  required  to  have 
customized and intended data set to be visualized for particular user/ Energy management systems (EMS) operator. The 
objective of innovative visualization with sustainable self-awareness feature is to serve real time data for different level 
of users with the specified authorization and based on their usability which leads visualization to self-awareness. The 
system will depict the required real time data efficiently with the expert system/intelligent system. 
13.3.8 Next Generation Data Analytics in Energy Domain 
Data Analytics for power system analysis could be efficiently implemented on Cloud Infrastructure. Project shall include 
the design and development of an application framework with Software Sub Modules for energy trading, billing, pricing 
and  t ools  for  l oad  forecasting  in  the  form  of  Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS).  Data  Analytics assist in analyzing  
specific  consumer  benefits,  support  efficient  delivery   and  investment  in  the electric system, facilitate customer 
choice etc., on which exhaustive and heuristic analysis can be done. 
Using Data Analytics, it is becoming possible to run simulations or models to predict the future outcome, rather than to 
simply provide backward looking data about past interactions, and to do these predictions in real-time to support each 
individual business action. While this may require significant changes to existing operational and Business Intelligence 
(BI) infrastructure, the potential exists to unlock significant improvements in business results and other success rates.  
Next-generation Analytics can support BI search tools that can find reports and generate Structured Query Language 
(SQL) queries, visual discovery tools to slice/dice data intuitively at the speed of thought. 
Data analytics and tools can also be used for monitoring and improving the performance of utilities and generating stations.

13.4   R&D IN DISTRIBUTION  
Distribution system has direct impact on the consumers. It is also an area in which there are significant challenges. A 
large share of system losses occurs in distribution circuits and a significant amount of power system investment goes in 
the purchase and installation of distribution hardware. Recently, the development of smart grid concepts and the use of 
solar power have changed the way in which distribution networks function. 
The  distribution  sector  requires  most  significant  priority  since  the  efficiency,  financial  viability  and  losses  effect  the 
viability of the total power sector as a whole. Various privatization models including franchising, Public Private Model, 
and others would need to be studied and comprehensive recommendations may be made State wise. The issues regarding 
refinancing of the debt to save on the interest burden on the utilities, bringing down the cost of procurement of power 
from outside the State need consideration. Hence R&D in distribution system needs impetus.  
Distribution system needs careful attention in the areas such as reduction in  losses,  metering, distribution automation, 
planning, harmonic pollution, custom power devices, Demand Side Management (DSM) etc. High Voltage Distribution 
System (HVDS) is an effective method for reduction of technical losses and improved voltage profile. Application of 
IT  has  great  potential  in  reducing  technical  and  commercial  losses.  Integrated  resource  planning  and  demand  side 
management also needs special attention and implementation. Substantial efforts are required for capacity building, so 
that  the  present  day  distribution  system  would  be  transformed  into  a  modern  day  distribution  system.  Smart  grid 
represents a vision for a digital upgrade of power distribution system to both optimize present operation as well as to 
open  up  new  avenues  for  alternative  energy  production.  Improvement  in  reliability  of  distribution  network  can  be 
achieved  with  deployment  of  Supervisory  Control  and  Data  Acquisition/Distribution  Management  System 
(SCADA/DMS) for remote monitoring and control of various network elements, obviating need for manned substations.   
Distribution   Management   System   (DMS)   extends   the   monitoring   and   control functionality of SCADA to 
distribution  transformers.  Remote  Terminal  Units  (RTUs)  and  Fault  Passage  Indicators  (FPIs)  are  installed  at 
substations.  
Design Automation: Expertise is available for manual design of distribution networks. But it is a labor-intensive activity 
and often results in non-standard and sub-optimal designs. There is a strong need to standardize and promote design 
automation techniques which would reduce costs and improve performance. 
Feeder  Load  Characteristics:  Individual  feeder  loads  differ  widely  in  their  behavior.  A  methodology  needs  to  be 
evolved  for  studying  feeders  in  order  to  characterize  them.  The  technique  should  be  relatively  simple  and  trade  off 
accuracy against efforts involved, since any distribution entity has a large number of feeders, and needs to accurately 
predict their contributions to the total load curve for the next day, so as to contract for energy supplies from generation 
companies.

13. 9 
           Central Electricity Authority 
  National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
Appropriate tariff models: Along with the usual charges based on monthly energy charges, it is possible to factor in 
charges based on time-of-day (TOD) and the ratio of peak time energy to average energy consumption. This can have 
the effect of reducing the overhead of the power sector infrastructure. But detailed studies are needed to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the scheme under typical Indian conditions, and to come up with the most effective tariff structures. 
 
Load  Shedding:  Currently  load  shedding  is  generally  carried  out  at  the  feeder  level,  with  an  entire  feeder  being 
disconnected as a single entity. With the facilities offered by smart grid, it is possible to be more selective, and enable 
the  system operator to shed non-essential loads,  while  maintaining service  to critical loads. With this flexibility, the 
system can be run more effectively, while critical loads having assured supply, less dependency on stand by genets. 
Detailed studies on this aspect will be useful. 
Security and Protection: In conventional distribution schemes, loads are protected mainly through over-current relays 
and fuses. A smart grid has the facility to provide more sophisticated protection. In addition, the ability to operate the 
feeder  through  remote  control  opens  up  the  possibility  of  load  control  in  response  to  under-frequency  and  voltage 
collapse conditions. 
13.4.1 R&D in Solar Organic Polymer based Light Emitting Devices  
High power Silicon based Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are gradually making large in-roads as common light sources. 
However, huge capital investment needed to manufacture LED and huge breakeven point is a serious deterrent in this 
competitive world. It is important to note that incandescent, fluorescent and Compact Fluorescent Light (CFL) sources 
have been popular for decades at lower wattages and metal halide and sodium vapour lamps at higher wattages for large 
area lighting. 
However,  there  is  scope  for  development  of  organic  polymer  based  electroluminescent  light  sources,  which  could 
compete with High power silicon based light emitting devices. The concept has been used and commercialized in some 
ways by leading manufacturers for backlit lighting of mobile phones.  
13.4.2 Distribution Automation 
The research work should be aimed at developing indigenous know-how of full scale Distribution Automation system, 
which can cover from primary substations to consumer level intelligent automation. The future research initiatives for 
power distribution automation are: 
  Customer Level Intelligent Automation System 
  Computer Aided Monitoring and Control of Distribution Transformers 
  Substation and Feeder Level Automation 
  Data communication system for Distribution Automation 
  Development and Standardization of Distribution Automation software 
13.5 R&D IN RENEWABLE ENERGY  
Hydrocarbon resource limits are bound to force the world away from fossil fuels in coming decades. In addition, the 
environmental  and  health  burdens  arising  out  of  the  use  of  hydrocarbons  may  force  mankind  towards  clean  energy 
systems. Therefore, there is a need for electric power industry to look at other technologies of power generation through 
solar, wind, biomass, small hydro, fuel cells, geothermal, tidal etc. 
Technologies  related  to  wind, biomass, solar, small  hydro, geothermal,  fuel cells, Waste  to  Energy (WtE)  need to 
be  identified.  Research  focus  is  on  grid  connectivity  of  large  wind  mills,  self-healing  wind  generation  connected 
micro-grids, distributed generation and large use of ethanol and hydrogen for energy products. Development of micro 
and mini grids and larger penetration of renewable energy is an important area of research

vastly different 
14)  Low wind speed turbine development (India has very few locations with high wind speeds)

3)  Bringing down the cost of solar PV cells and wind power generation  
4)  O&M issues of renewable energy generation

  Any changes required of the materials of construction of turbine rotor blades, generator rotor, insulation, etc., for 
 
future applications with greater induction of solar and wind power. 
 
13.6 R&D IN MICROGRIDS  
A Microgrid is a local energy grid with controlled capability which means it can disconnect from the main grid and 
operate autonomously. The grid connects homes; business and other building to central power resources which allow 
the use of appliances, heating/cooling systems and electronics devices. But this interconnectedness means that when 
part of the grid needs to be repaired everyone is affected. A Microgrid generally operates while connected to the grid, 
but importantly it can break off and operate on its own using local energy generation in time of crisis like storms or 
power  outages  or  for  other  reasons.  Microgrid  can  be  powered  by  distributed  generators,  batteries  and  renewable 
resources like solar panels. Depending on how it is fueled and how its requirements are managed, a Microgrid might run 
indefinitely. Microgrid connected to the grid at a Point of Common Coupling (PCC) that maintains voltage at the same 
level as the main grid unless there is some sort of problem on the grid or other reasons to disconnect. A Microgrid not 
only provides backup for the grid in case of emergencies but can also be used to cut energy costs or connected to local 
resources that is too small or unreliable for traditional grid use. The microgrid allows communities to be more energy 
independent and environmental friendly. 
Microgrids can be described by one of four categories: 
  Off grid Microgrids including islands, remote sites and other microgrid systems not connected to local utility 
network. 
  Campus Microgrids-That are fully interconnected with a local utility grid but can also maintain some level of 
service in isolation from the grid. 
  Community Microgrids-Integrated into utility network. 
  Nanogrids- Comprise of smallest discrete network units with the capability to operate independently. 
13.6.1 Impedance Emulator 
Switched impedances are needed to correct power factor in Micro-grid systems. In the case of switched systems many 
inductors or capacitors are connected. A solid-state equivalent of a motor generator (MG) set to test battery powered 
inverters is developed. These inverters (Equipment Under Test - EUT) are to be loaded with variable inductor, capacitor, 
or even resistors. However, to reduce the resistive losses and yet maintain high power factor and low Total Harmonic 
Distortion (THD) on the EUT, a novel system need to be developed, which is similar to an electronic Motor Generator 
set. This can also be deployed as a Pulse Width Modulated Power (PWMP) factor correction system in micro grids. 
It is well known that renewable energy resources are distributed throughout the country. Wind power is available in 
southern  and  western  parts,  whereas  solar  power  is  available  in  north  western,  central  and  northern  parts  of  India. 
Similarly, small hydel potential is identified in the Himalayan and North-Eastern parts of the country. Apart from these 
renewable energy resources, biomass potential is also identified in few Indian metro cities. 
To meet the power demand of the country, in particular the un-electrified rural Indian population from the sustainable 
energy resources in a reliable manner, the hybrid combination of conventional and non-conventional resources in off 
grid and grid connected mode are potential power solution in Indian context. Tapping power from these resources and 
integration  with  the  national  grid  is  a  very  challenging  issue.  It  involves  delicate  operation  and  control,  interfacing, 
storage, generation/load forecasting and regulatory issues. Even though in India, we have few simple micro-grid (having 
only one or two resources) in operation, their application is mainly focused only on power production and lacks research 
and  development  activities.  Therefore,  there  is  immediate  requirement  for  renewable  energy  based  micro  grid  as  a 
reliable solution for electrification of power isolated area.Govt. of India has an extensive plan to generate more green 
power from sustainable renewable energy resources. Therefore, a modern state of art micro grid research infra-structure 
is highly required in India for carrying out extensive research in this area.

13.7   R&D IN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM 
Though the telecommunication sector initially started with transmitting voice over wired lines the telecom companies 
have  diversified  into  multimedia,  wireless  communication  etc.  in  a  big  way.  Electrical  utilities  have  started  finding 
benefits from advances in communication technology. People did try to develop Power Line Carrier Communication 
(PLCC) separately riding purely on power lines itself. But it failed due to impedance offered by power network. Power 
Grid is already planning to deploy fiber optic cable network along the entire transmission system across the country. It 
must be noted that electrical network is one of the most widely dispersed networks along the length and breadth of the 
country. 
 
Alternatively, it is suggested that the electrical utilities (transmission and distribution together) run fiber optic cables 
along HT lines down to the ultimate consumers. These cables could be laid alongside HT cables and even on 11 kV 
lines and down to 3 phase LT lines along the same cable, in the same trench, on the same pole and maintained by the 
utility. The utility uses it for its own data communication and could lease it to cable operators for a fixed extra monthly 
income. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) regulates bandwidth for wireless radio frequency and not 
for fiber optic lines. Utility can plan for laying underground pipes to carry both power lines and also draw about 10 fiber 
optic  lines  in  all  new  trenches.  TV,  computer  network  terminations  should  have  fiber  optic  modem  or  set  top  box 
interface modules- if not available, it should be developed indigenously. This will make the city/ town free from hanging 
wires, reduce road digging by multiple entities and bring in discipline among utilities.  
Microwave towers are considered to pose health risks also by some.  Also many companies are working on Light Based 
Field Interface (LIFI) as alternative to Wi-Fi. LEDs can also be used to carry signal information superimposed on its 
powering current. Fluctuations in lumen output will not be noticeable. This is not possible with incandescent bulb or 
metal halide or sodium vapour lamps as bandwidth is low. 
13.8 R&D IN ENVIRONMENT 
The  need  for  electricity  generation  to  be  clean  and  safe  has  never  been  more  obvious.    Environmental  and  health 
consequences of electricity generation are important issues, alongside the affordability of the power which is produced. 
Production of electricity from any form of primary energy has some environmental effect. The power sector in India is 
one of the largest emitters of CO2.  The share of the power sector CO2 emissions in the total CO2 emissions in India is 
higher than the global average. The main reason for such a high share is the power sector’s heavy reliance still on coal.  
There are various technologies and processes that have substantial potential to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emission. 
Clean coal technologies and renewable energy usage have been adopted by India as methods of best approach to tackle 
climate change issues.   
Along with all these methods, further steps can be implemented for reduction of CO2 emissions. These are research and 
development;  information  and  education  (for  awareness);  economic  measures;  regulatory  measures;  and  voluntary 
agreements.  Each  step  offers  advantages  and  drawbacks  and  has  different  effects  on  CO2  reduction.  Low  carbon 
generation options, nuclear and renewable technologies, are needed to substantially reduce emissions. Due to the high 
ash  content  of  Indian  coal,  oxy-fueling  and  post  combustion  CO2  capture  would  be  suitable  options  for  India.  Pre 
combustion capture in a coal fired IGCC plant would require the adaptation of the technology to the Indian coal quality. 
Retrofitting coal power plants with CO2 capture technologies could be an option to achieve clean coal technology. 
Developments of following technology ready methods are being tried: 
1)  Use of CO2 for reduction in pH of ash water 
2)  CO2 capture by Modified Amine Solution 
3)  Development of Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) process for CO 2 capture and conversion of CO2 into 
useful products 
PSA is a technology used for separation of some gas species from a mixture of gases under pressure according to the 
species' molecular characteristics and affinity for an adsorbent material. Special adsorptive materials (e.g. Zeolite)

are used as a molecular sieve, preferentially adsorbing the target gas species at high pressure. The process then swings 
to low pressure to desorb the adsorbent material.  
Clean    environment    mechanism    at    thermal    power    stations,    creating    data    base    for  ash  quality,  advanced  ash 
management schemes, sustaining  coal based  power  generation  considering new  and emerging  environmental  issues, 
effects  of  electromagnetic  (EM)  waves  on  human  beings  with  specific  reference  to  up-gradation  of  transmission 
voltages,  eco-design  and  energy  efficient  power  transformers,  development  of  waste  water  treatment  &  recycling 
technologies, emission control technologies for NOx, SOx and mercury are some of the areas where R&D activities are 
required for improvement of environment and for sustainable development. 
 
 13.9 INFRASTRUCTURE FOR TESTING AND CERTIFICATION 
 In order to support the ambitious schemes of Government of India like “Make in India”, “Start-up India” etc., and the 
need  for  maintaining  quality  and  reliability  of  products  manufactured  in  India,  there  is  a  need  for  infrastructure 
development and setting up of regional testing laboratories to help small scale and medium entrepreneurs for producing 
quality power products in India. CPRI is well equipped for testing and certification of electrical product and Government 
of India has been supporting the infrastructure development for testing. However, there are certain test requirements for 
which facilities are not presently available either at CPRI or in private laboratories in India. Based on the discussion 
with manufacturers and Power utilities, the following have been identified as new areas for which testing facilities are 
to be established in a phased manner during the years 2017-27.

under  the  Central  Power  Research  Institute.  The  regional  laboratories  can  also  help  in  setting  up  of  many  Microgrid 
projects to exploit the opportunities presented by renewable sources of energy. These Centres can supplement government 
programmes which are intended to provide 24 X 7 electric power to all, especially in the rural sector. 
Sufficient funds should be made available for setting up of new Regional testing and Research laboratories for speedy 
implementation of projects envisaged for the growth of Indian Power sector.

13.10  CHALLENGES IN TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT 
There  are  certain  key  considerations  for  administration  of  an  effective  and  commercially  viable  R&D  programme  to 
compliment the Government of India schemes. Some of these aspects are as follows.  
 
13.10.1 Role of CPRI in the management of R&D in Electrical Power Sector   
CPRI  plays  a  crucial  role  to  promote  and  execute  R&D  activities  in  power  &  energy  sector  for  the  country.  R&D 
component of CPRI activities must be considerably enhanced with added inputs and emphasis. This requires appropriate 
modifications of policies. Proper demarcation of activities under R&D, Test & Certification, and Quality assurance is 
needed  internally.  The  task  ahead  is  to  create  and  consolidate  suitable  R&D  infrastructure  and  effectively  execute 
relevant activities suited to the country. There should be a distinct and separate R&D structure at CPRI with specialized 
infrastructure and expert manpower to work exclusively on critical and futuristic technologies as needed by the stake-
holders.   
CPRI’s interaction with Academia and R&D Organizations and premier institutions like ISRO, BARC and CSIR needs 
to  be  further  strengthened  to  generate  synergy  and  avoid  duplication  of  expensive  infrastructure.  CPRI  has  to  be 
strengthened for consortium mode of R&D involving Academia, Industry and Utilities.  
CPRI scheme of involving expert consultants and visiting professors should be effectively leveraged further to form an 
expert  base  to  guide  the  academic  and  research  programs  undertaken  through  R&D  projects.  Leveraging  National 
Knowledge Network (NKN), a National Data base of Power & Energy Experts drawn from CEA, IITs, NITs, PSUs, 
MNCs, PIOs and Private sector has to be created to tap core expertise for R&D. 
International collaboration on R&D activities must be pursued vigorously by CPRI to achieve ‘Vision of Excellence’ to 
reach global standards. This includes collaboration arrangements with centres of excellence of advanced countries. 
13.11 
INITIATIVES FOR IMPROVING R&D IN THE POWER SECTOR 
13.11.1 Reliability & Asset management of existing T&D system components 
As India plans for 1200 kV transmission system, an authentic database of the reliability of the existing systems and 
apparatus up to 400 kV class will be the basic need. We have apparatus in the power system which are as old as 50 years 
and more but are performing satisfactorily.  A national diagnostic and reliability assessment plan of the Indian systems 
as  a  joint  study  plan  between  the  various  utilities  and  the  manufacturers  will  give  tremendous  knowledge  base  and 
learnings  as  we  migrate  to  higher  and  higher  voltage  levels  of  transmission  and  associated  apparatus.  A  ‘national 
classified registry’ could be created about the reliability of the Indian power network based on the diagnostic studies. 
 
13.11.2  Need for creation of globally recognized ‘Centres of Excellence’ under national mission 
There  is  a  need  to  identify  the  ‘R&D  needs’  of  various  sectors  and  various  stake  holders,  and  create  ‘Centres  of 
Excellence’ across the nation at various selected organizations in identified technical areas.  This should be a national 
R&D  priority.    The  competence  level  of  the  experts,  the  sophistication  of  the  infrastructure,  the  quality  of  research 
programme undertaken, the quality of outputs, the Intellectual Property Right (IPR), etc. must be nurtured incentivized 
and promoted. 
CPRI  being  the  prime  R&D  organization  for  the  electrical  power  sector  should  convert  and  create  ‘Centres  of 
Excellence’ in many areas such as ‘Advanced Polymers for Electrical Applications’, ‘Electrical Insulation Materials & 
Processes’, ‘Power System Analysis’, and ‘Advanced Diagnostics for Power System Components’.

13.11.3 National R&D programmes  
The two national R&D programs of the Ministry of Power, RSOP and NPP, administered through CPRI in consultation 
with  CEA  have  given  a  good  boost  to  the  R&D  efforts  of  the  Utilities,  Academia,  R&D  organizations,  and  the 
Manufacturers. They have helped in building R&D infrastructure in many organizations over a period of time. 
 
The guidelines and the methodology of selection, monitoring, and reviewing of the funded R&D projects need to be 
online and through IT enabled R&D management system.  Further a national level ‘R&D project digital data base’ of 
all nationally funded major projects will help in realization of the R&D objectives. A suitable online R&D management 
system needs to be in place, primarily at CPRI, and also across the other national R&D centres of importance. 
13.11.4 Competence mapping and competence nurturing 
 
India has one of the largest scientific and technology pool in the world.  Many of them are national and international 
level experts. There is a need to scientifically measure the competence level and competence areas of the experts and 
the  organization  to  classify  the  country’s  expertise  level  on  various  areas.  This  would  help  in  deploying  the  right 
scientific input to a given R&D project. The ‘measurement matrix for competence mapping’ has to be created and the 
experts and expert organizations are to be evaluated against the norms stipulated. This will help in creating a ‘knowledge 
bank  of  country’s  expert  resources’,  rather  than  arbitrarily  rating  the  country’s  expertise  and  the  experts  in  various 
areas.  The upgradation of knowledge level through training could thus be more structured and measured. India’s key 
technical competence areas, the competence level of various R&D organizations, the competence level of the experts, 
etc. can be documented for improvement purpose. 
 
CPRI, CSIR, DRDO laboratories who are involved in many R&D programmes, may benefit substantially by evaluating 
the core competencies of the organization in various areas, and could be a scientific basis for creation and monitoring 
of ‘Centres of Excellence’ in their identified core competence areas. This could be a national R&D mission project. 
 
13.11.5 ‘Knowledge Academy’ in the area of Electrical Power 
 
There  is  a  great  need  to  provide  a  ‘reservoir  and  a  continuous  pipeline’  of  qualified  and  competent  technical  and 
scientific workforce in the area of electrical power.  There is urgency to create a ‘CPRI Academy’ to provide structured 
courses on electrical power to fresh and experienced engineers who will contribute to the technology base of the country. 
It may be like an autonomous University, providing basic level and advanced level theoretical and practical courses to 
engineers. With more and more engineers opting to software related career, there is a great dearth of skilled and practical 
electrical engineers in the country with adequate domain knowledge.   
 
13.11.6 Intellectual Property Right (IPR) Management Cells in National Level Laboratories 
 
There is an urgent need to promote awareness related to IPRs amongst the scientists and technologists. An ‘IPR cell’ 
with IPR policies and procedures need to be formulated to suit the need and purpose of the national R&D organizations. 
The IPR cell should be manned by experts  who are  skilled in training the scientists of the organization, setting IPR 
targets, and facilitating the innovation management of the organization. 
 
13.11.7 Initiation of Mega projects of disruptive technologies 
Disruptive technologies provide quantum jump in the technology advancement. All the breakthrough developments have 
happened essentially through material / system developments. There are very few R&D projects of this category in the 
electrical power sector. Mega projects like super conductor based fault current limiters, and transformers have been in 
the  research  mode  for  quite  long,  as  also  research  in  the  field  of  combustion  process,  gasification  process,  nano-
technology, high temperature steels etc. CPRI could coordinate a well-planned mega research scheme in many of these 
areas under NPP scheme of larger dimensions. ‘Wireless power transmission’ is another disruptive breakthrough. R&D 
project to be initiated as collaborative project with huge impact in the electrical power sector.

13.11.8 Easing the Market entry for newly / indigenously developed power products 
In  the  context  of  Power  Sector,  many  indigenously  developed  products,  especially  those  involving  substantial 
developmental  investment,  face  entry  barrier  in  the  form  of  qualification  requirements  pertaining  to  equipment 
performance over a minimum period   specified by end users. Though this has arisen out of genuine reliability concerns 
of new products, this provides some  inertia  for  indigenous development.  Users’ interests  can  be safeguarded  by  the 
product developers by way of recourse to deferred payments, extended guarantees or insurance cover to indemnify them 
against the risk of failure. Further, development of indigenous products must be encouraged by providing an opportunity 
to  the  developers  to  carryout  field  trials  on  no  cost  basis. This has to be considered to promote national R&D efforts.  
 
There is a need for enunciation of a clear policy / guideline to provide incentives for the commercialization of products 
developed through indigenous R&D efforts. The incentive could be among others, in the form of excise duty exemption 
at least for a period of five years from the date of commercialization. 
13.11.9 Strengthening of the R&D Infrastructure 
R&D Infrastructure at National Level needs strengthening in terms of facilities especially for type testing  of prototypes 
with a view to minimize development / commercialization cycle. Many cases exist where the customers prefer overseas 
test reports as sufficient facilities do not exist in the country. A national audit may be conducted through Industry and 
utility forums to identify the gaps and efforts should be made to bridge the gaps.    
13.11.10 R&D Mechanism 
Research  and  Development  towards  innovative  technologies  has  always  been  crucial  for  meeting  future  energy 
challenges.  The  requirement  and  capacity  to  apply  sound  tools  in  developing  effective  Research  and  Development 
(R&D) strategies and programs is becoming increasingly important. The need to promote development and refinement 
of analytical approaches to energy technology analysis, R&D priority setting and assessment of benefits from  R&D 
activities has become need of the hour.  
Management of modern R&D is complex and it requires discreet but multiple interface with academia, R&D institutions, 
government  etc.,  besides  leveraging  core  strength  of  the  organization.  Also,  the  R&D  management  should  be  well 
structured. In line with the aforesaid, following R&D strategy is proposed to be adopted: 
13.11.11 R&D Platforms 
Platforms to support international cooperation and collaboration could increase the effectiveness of R&D investments. 
These include:  
  Technology transfer mechanisms;  
 
 
  Opening internships and researcher exchanges with other countries;  
 
 
 
Information sharing on both technology and best practice;  
International support for demonstration projects to improve the outlook for R&D;  
International exhibition of R&D equipment, instruments, and materials; and  
Information sharing systems to collect and disseminate information on renewable energy technologies. 
International  collaboration  can  provide  opportunities  for  information  exchange,  multiply  the  benefits  from 
R&D programs, including communicating best practices and lessons learned. 
 
13.11.12 Policies for R&D  
 
  Developing integrated R&D plans based on a multi-disciplinary approach. A well-integrated R&D plan would 
ensure that proposed programs are culturally appropriate, reflect current and planned resource endowments, 
and involve communities in discussions of energy policy;  
  Removing fossil fuel subsidies to balance the energy pricing mechanism in order to attract or drive private 
capital to the energy industry;

  Developing  skills  and  capacities  to  create  a  knowledge  workforce  leads  to  success  of  energy  efficiency 
programs, proper operation and maintenance of clean technologies;  
  Providing as much certainty as possible concerning long-term (e.g. 5 to 10 years) funding for R&D 
  Monitoring and evaluating R&D programs results to enable timely adjustments to funding levels and strategies 
 
where necessary 
In  addition  to  subsidizing  electricity  through  low  tariffs,  policy  should  support  and  subsidize  purchase  of 
energy efficient appliances 
 
 
13.11.13 Institutional and funding framework for R&D 
Government should fund the R&D programme through schemes such as National Perspective Plan (NPP) and Research 
Scheme on Power (RSoP). Some of them can be in collaborative mode with participation from CPSUs, Industry and 
academic institutes and utilities. 
CPRI,  NTPC,  NHPC,  SJVNL,  Powergrid,  DISCOMs,  BHEL,  CSIR,  CSIR  laboratories,  Government  funded  R&D 
Institutions, IITs, NITs may execute the projects identified, which shall be coordinated and managed by CEA and CPRI 
on behalf of MoP. 
With  a  view  to  create  R&D  infrastructure  and  to  establish  new  facilities,  augmentation  of  existing  facilities  and 
establishment of regional testing laboratories in different parts of India is essential. 
Government should continue to support CPRI through capital grants. The regional laboratories of CPRI can help India’s 
small and medium Entrepreneurs to produce globally competitive electrical products.  This will be a major initiative to 
boost our “Make in India” programme. Further Government should provide test and evaluation facilities at subsidized 
and affordable rates to Indian Manufacturers through Central Power Research Institute.   
Policy to earmark a larger percentage of profit after tax by PSUs as part of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) should 
be considered to provide the much needed impetus to R&D in Power sector. 
13.12  RECOMMENDATIONS 
Followings are the important recommendations of this sub-group:  
  Preparation of a well-defined R&D Vision and Policy document clearly highlighting the R&D plan  for the next 
decade and providing incentives for the commercialization of products developed by indigenous R&D efforts of 
start-up organizations based in India 
  Enhance Delegation of Power to R&D division to improve the performance and delivery of the system.  
  Development  of  a  platform  for  collaborative  research  involving  Industries,  Utilities,  R&D  organizations  and 
Academia both national and international levels to bridge the technology gaps, strengthen expertise, and build synergy.  
 
 Consideration of  R&D  projects  of  national  importance  that  require  serious  intellectual  and  financial  resource  as 
Government.  
National Mission projects with funding from  
  Creation  of  ecosystems  where  MNCs,  industry  associations  and  professional  societies  may  work  in  tandem  in 
different R&D Programs of the nation to compliment schemes like “Make in India”, Start up India”, “Power for 
all” and help in creation of more jobs. 
  Creation of ‘National Registry of experts & expertise’ in various areas by competence mapping.  
  Creation of Centers of Excellence (CoE) in identified areas to take up application oriented research projects.   
  Establishment of ‘Power Academy’ or ‘CPRI Academy’ to enhance the knowledge base of fresh and experienced 
engineers which will also serve as a ‘finishing   school’  for  young  engineers  and  as  ‘refresher  training  centre’ 
for middle level management.  
  Formulation  of  an  effective  IPR  policy  for  the  national  R&D  organizations  to  protect  the  innovations  of  R&D 
engineers and also to avoid possible infringements.

14.1.4 Manpower engaged in the plants proposed for retirement 
 
It is proposed that thermal capacity of 22,716 MW may be retired in the period of 2017-22 and 25,572 MW in 2022-27. The 
units proposed for retirement are old ones and generally having the unit capacity of 250 MW and below have higher Man/ 
MW norms i.e. in the tune of 1.5 Persons/ MW than required for new units to be set up which are mostly of size 660 MW and 
higher. Further, the manpower to get retired at the rate of 20% per year have already been considered. Therefore, the manpower 
required for the O&M of the capacity to be added in 2017-27 will be even less than the manpower engaged in the capacity 
proposed for retirement. Thus in thermal areas, theoretically, there will be no net addition of manpower during 2017-27. Thus 
the  manpower engaged in the plants to be retired needs to be reoriented / retrained in the modern thermal technology for 
engaging them in new power plants planned to be commissioned in 2017-27. 
Manpower Norms and the order of  manpower de-engaged in the  thermal capacity proposed for retirement is as tabulated 
below-

The re-engagement of the manpower from the plants proposed for retirement would pose a challenge in that the plants 
retiring  and  the  plants  coming  up  may  be  under  different  organisations  and  also  the  plants  retiring  and  the  plants 
commissioning owned by the same organisation may be at different geographical locations. The complete manpower 
going to be de-engaged may not be suitable for re-engagement.  Therefore, it will require a great deal of strategy and 
planning for smoothening the transition of manpower.

From the Table 14.14 it is observed that sufficient number of Engineers, Managers and Diploma holders are available. 
However, in respect of lower level skills like that of ITI, there are certain gaps in numbers of skills as explained below. 
 
Our  ITIs  and  other  vocational  training  institutions  have  to  be  augmented  for  providing  certain  skill  sets  like  High 
Pressure Welders, Fabricators, Fitters, Binders, Drillers, Plumbers, Electricians, Linemen, Heavy Machine Operators, 
Operators-Crane, Dozer, Dumper, Excavation, Bar Benders, Piling Rig Operators etc. who would be required in huge 
number  for  the  Erection  &  Commissioning  Activities  for  the  Thermal,  Hydro,  Nuclear  Plants  and  Transmission  & 
Distribution areas. The quality and range of their training will keep pace with the changing needs of the economy and 
opportunities for self-development. 
 
14.3 TRAINING NEED ASSESSMENT  
 
14.3.1 Training Strategy 
 
To fulfil the above needs, training to the power sector personnel is provided in the following categories: 
 
i)         O&M Training to all existing employees engaged in O&M of generating projects (Thermal, Hydel, Gas) and 
Transmission & Distribution System as per statutory requirements under the Gazette Notification of September 
2010 issued by CEA ranging from 4 Weeks to 30 Weeks.  
 
This inter-alia includes the following: 
- Classroom Training  
- Simulator Training for Thermal and Hydel 
- On-Job Training 
 
ii) Induction level training for new recruits Technical & Non-Technical is considered a must in the power sector 
iii) 
Refresher/Advanced  training  of  5  Days  in  a  year  to  all  existing  personnel  of  varying  degrees  in  various 
specializations in line with National Training Policy for Power Sector. 
iv)  Management  training  of  5  Days  in  a  year  to  the  Senior  Executives/Managers  in  India/Abroad  in  line  with 
National Training Policy for Power Sector. 
v) Training for personnel from retiring units found suitable for re-engagement. 
 
The most important component of the strategy should be “Training for All” irrespective of the level in the hierarchy. At 
least one-week of training in a year must be provided to every individual. Five days training per annum per technical 
person based on National Training Policy is being implemented selectively at some utilities. This needs to be strictly 
implemented.

Projects (Thermal, Hydel, Gas) and Transmission & Distribution.  This training varies from 2 weeks to 16 weeks.  
  Induction Training 
Induction training to all technical personnel is a must. 
  Refresher/Advanced Training 
Refresher/Advanced  Training  must  be  arranged  for  each  individual  on  promotion,  which  calls  for  performing 
new/different roles and working conditions. 
A mix of Technical, Commercial and Management capabilities of 1 week is proposed. 
  Training  of  Personnel  engaged  in  the  thermal  plants  to  retire  for  their  re-engagement  in  new 
power plants  
Manpower  engaged  in  the  plants  to  be  retired  needs  to  be  reoriented  /  retrained  in  the  modern  thermal 
technology for engaging them in new power plants planned to be commissioned in 2017-27. 
  Management Training 
Continuous  development  of  Executives/Managers,  especially  at  the  transition  period  of  their  career  and  in  the 
context of constantly changing business environment and the Regulatory aspects is of utmost importance. Aspects 
of Commercial and Regulatory affairs of the power sector should be taught to the executives. Also, Executives in 
Finance and Management with non-technical background should be provided technical orientation through suitable 
training programs. For this a training of 1 week is proposed. 
  Simulator Training  
As  per  the  Gazette  Notification  No.  CEI/1/59/CEA/EI  (Measures  relating  to  Safety  and  Electric  Supply) 
Regulations, 2010, Simulator training of 2 weeks & 1 Week is a must for operation and maintenance personnel of 
Thermal and Hydro plants respectively. This is included in O&M training above. For safe and efficient functioning 
of manual and automatic equipment, personnel have to be trained on Simulators. Load Despatch System Operators 
may also be imparted training on Simulators. 
  Training in Renewable Sources of Energy 
Since it is envisaged that about 32,741 MW of Renewable Energy is added in 2012-17 and 1,17,756 MW in 
2017-22 and 1,00,000MW in 2022-27, it is proposed that specialized training of at least 1-2 months should 
be  given  in  various  renewable  energy  technologies  like  solar,  wind,  bio-mass,  small  hydel  etc.  Grid 
connectivity of Renewable energy sources may also be given importance in training. 
  Training in Demand Side Management, Energy Efficiency and Energy Conservation 
Training for Energy Managers and Energy Auditors, Industry personnel, Operators, Farmers should also be 
provided in respect of DSM, Energy Conservation & Energy Efficiency. Energy Conservation should also 
be a part of course curriculum for students. 
  Power System Operators Training  
System Planners, Operators & Engineers should be given regular refresher training and the new entrants 
should be given exhaustive training of 3 months. This training shall be required to be given to about 250 – 
300 trainees every year during the years 2017-22.

needs to be laid upon skill development of such Manpower. 
  Introduction of Training on Attitudinal Changes / Behavioural Sciences 
It is highly recommended to introduce training on Attitudinal Changes / Behavioural Sciences in the curriculum of 
induction level training as  well as re-training programs.  After undergoing such training, the personnel develop a 
sense of belongingness to the organization. 
In  addition  to  Technical  Skills,  Power  Professionals  need  to  have  Life  Skills  like  Communication  Skills,  Time 
Management, Team Work, Technical Writing, Morals & Ethics etc. 
  Training in Information Technology & Cyber Security 
Information technology has pervaded all facets of life. Adequate training according to the job requirement should 
be provided in the field of information technology & cyber security. Use of IT should be promoted and maximum 
number of personnel should be made computer literate.  
  Training of Non-Technical Officers and Staff  
Training of non-technical officers and staff should be done in regular intervals in the functional skills/management 
areas in association with the concerned Institutes as per needs. 
  HRD and Capacity Building for Power Generating Stations   
It is proposed to have a capacity building program for the Executives, Engineers, and Operators of Power Stations 
in both State and Central Sectors in the areas of DSM, Energy Management and Energy Audit during the years 2017-
22 and 2022-27. 
  Training for Nuclear Power Personnel 
Due  to  stringent  safety  requirements  and  other  national  and  international  regulations,  every  person  working  in 
Nuclear Power Sector is exposed to specialized training. To meet the multi-disciplinary needs, the Department of 
Atomic Energy (DAE) has built in-house training facilities both for professionals and non-professionals. 
  Training Abroad 
Live  liaison  should  be  made  with  the  concerned  authorities  to  depute  the  eligible  personnel  for  training  in  the 
developed countries to keep them abreast of the latest global developments. 
  Hot Line Maintenance Training 
There is a  great demand from  various Utilities for Hot  Line Maintenance Training. There is an urgent  need for 
augmentation of Training Capacity as this type of Training is presently being imparted by only two institutes in the 
country. 
  Training through Distance learning education, E-Learning & Web based Training 
Since it may not be possible for all the persons engaged in Construction and O&M of Power Projects, knowledge 
upgradation & training is suggested through correspondence and also by way of Web based Training and also through 
e-learning. 
  Need for written Training Policy by every Utility 
Every Utility of Central Sector, State Sector & Private Sector should have a written Training Policy indicating how 
the organisation proposes to meet its Training needs.

From the Table 14.15, it is evident that there is no deficit in training infrastructure in Thermal and Transmission areas.  
However,  there  is  need  for  creation  of  infrastructure  in  Hydro  and  Distribution  areas  considering  that  all  existing 
employees  are  imparted  1-week  training  annually  and  new  inductees  are  imparted  induction  training  of  duration 
mentioned in the CEA Regulations. Actual deficit in Hydro and Distribution would be marginally less as almost all 
NPTI  institutes  also  conduct  training  in  Hydro  areas  except  HLTC,  Bangalore  and  in  distribution  areas  while 
predominantly they conduct training in thermal areas except in case of PSTI and HLTC at Bangalore and HPTC at 
Nangal, Punjab. Further, some infrastructure  available  with training cells,  which also impart training, at the power 
companies would also reduce the infrastructure deficit.  
The existing infrastructure itself is grossly under-utilised. The under-utilisation is mainly due to organisations under 
state government particularly Discoms giving almost no attention to training. Thus, efforts should be made to optimally 
utilise the existing infrastructure.  
All the organisation under state/pvt/ central sector are required to impart training to their personnel at Government 
recognised institutes as mandated in CEA’s Safety Regulations 2010.  
There is a need for creation of infrastructure by way of setting up new institutes or augmenting the infrastructure in 
the  existing institutes i.e. in CEA recognized institutes and other training institutes. However, priority be given on 
utilization of existing input structure. More infrastructure can be created in phased manner. Same approach may be 
adopted in case of simulator training infrastructure.

Total annual training load during 2022-27 will be about 1335 thousand-man-weeks. In the areas of Nuclear, solar and 
wind power, the training load requirement is also depicted in Table 14.22. Training of personnel engaged is Nuclear 
power is not controlled by the Ministry of Power. The concerned Ministry may take stock of the training infrastructure 
in  Nuclear  power.  Similarly,  the  area  of  Solar  and  Wind  power  comes  under  MNRE.  The  training  infrastructure 
available for training in solar and wind power is not well organised and low in comparison to the requirement. The 
existing power sector institutes need to start training/ augment training capacity for RE areas.  Training in solar and 
wind areas may be made statutory on the line of training specified for those engaged in the O&M of Thermal, and 
Hydro power plants, thereby the infrastructure creation will gain momentum and training could be provided in more 
fruitful and productive manner.  
 
14.3.3.4 Simulator Training Load 
 
Training infrastructure to meet mandatory simulator training has very little shortage in thermal which would be bridged 
once 6 planned simulators at different NPTIs are installed. Requirement of hydro simulator would also be met once these 
multi-mode  simulators  are  installed  at  NPTI.  The  simulator  training  load  requirement  and  existing  availability  are 
indicated in Table 14.17 which depicts the simulator training to supervisors and engineers comprising about 36% 
of total new technical inductees in 2017-22.

There would be 46,420 MW new capacity addition in Thermal category in 2022-27. The existing simulator capacity 
could be utilised to impart training in refresher courses to existing employees in the Thermal area.  
 
NPTI is already in the process of procuring multi-functional Simulators at six (6) of its institutes and, thus no additional 
expenditure may be required. 
 
14.4 FUNDING 
 
14.4.1 Funding for Classroom Training Infrastructure for Engineers, Supervisors and Operators 
The  maximum  infrastructure  requirement  for  class-room  training  for  engineers,  supervisors  and  operators  has  been 
calculated as 1267 thousand-man-weeks per year for 2017-22. The infrastructure available for class-room training for 
engineers, supervisors and operators has been estimated as 435 thousand-man-weeks per year for 2017-22. Therefore, 
there is a huge deficit of 794 thousand-man-week infrastructure in O&M training of technical personnel for 2017-22 in 
the field of conventional power. When training load for solar and wind is included the infrastructure shortage adds to 
817 thousand-man-weeks. In terms of area specific break up, there is no shortage of infrastructure in Transmission and 
Thermal areas. However, In the distribution sector the infrastructure requirement for class-room training for engineers, 
supervisors and operators has been calculated as 927 thousand-man-weeks per year for 2017-22 while the infrastructure 
available for class-room training for engineers, supervisors and operators for distribution sector has been estimated as 
23  thousand-man-weeks  per  year  for  2017-22.  In  the  Hydro  area  also,  there  is  only  34  thousand-man-weeks

           Central Electricity Authority 
 National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
infrastructure available as against the requirement of 56 thousand-man-week. Thus, there is deficit of 22 thousand-man-
weeks per year for 2017-22 in Hydro area.  
To bridge the infrastructure gap corresponding to 816 thousand-man-weeks and cater to training load in 2017-22, a huge 
fund would be required to be invested by the concerned organisations. 
The training infrastructure required for the 2022-27 is to meet the training load of 1335 thousand-man-weeks per year, 
which is little more than that the requirement of 1267 thousand-man-weeks per year in 2017-22 period.  
 
14.4.2 Funding for Thermal Simulator Infrastructure 
As per the Gazette Notification No. CEI/1/59/CEA/EI (Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply) Regulations, 
2010 of CEA, persons working in the O&M of Thermal Power Plants have to undergo 2 weeks simulator training. The 
infrastructure  available for simulator training has been calculated based on the existing  simulators available in the 
country,  which  is  4.8  thousand-man-weeks  per  year.  The  infrastructure  requirement  has  been  calculated  as  5.79 
thousand-man-weeks per year for the 2022-27. Therefore, there is deficit of 0.99 in Thermal simulator infrastructure.  
Considering a batch size of 16 and total number of 22 batches in a year, one training simulator can provide 0.704 of 
thousand man weeks in a year. Therefore, to create the simulator infrastructure required for deficit training requirement 
of 0.99 thousand-man-weeks per year during the 2022-27.  
However, no funding is required in this respect as NPTI is already in the process of acquiring 6 multi-mode Simulators.  
 
14.4.3 Funding for Hydro Simulator Infrastructure 
As per the Gazette Notification No. CEI/1/59/CEA/EI (Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply) Regulations, 
2010 of CEA, persons working in the O&M of hydel power plants have to undergo 1 week simulator training. The 
infrastructure available for simulator training has been calculated based on the existing  simulators available in the 
country,  which  is  0.45  thousand-man-weeks  per  year.  The  infrastructure  requirement  has  been  calculated  as  1.32 
thousand-man-weeks per  year for the 2017-22 and 2.88 thousand-man-weeks per  year for the 2022-27. Therefore, 
there is a deficit of 0.87 thousand-man-weeks per year for the 2017-22, which could be bridged with the setting up of 
simulators by 6 NPTIs at different locations. Thus, no more investment in hydro simulator would be required. While 
calculating the availability, a batch size of 10 and total number of 44 weeks has been considered in a year, thus one 
training simulator providing 0.44 thousand-man-weeks in a year.  
 
14.4.4 Funding for Training 
To create the infrastructure required to meet the annual training load in 2017-22, a huge investment shall be required.  
However, it is proposed that instead of creating new infrastructure, all NPTI institutes along with two upcoming institutes 
one each in Kerala and Madhya Pradesh may be fully utilized to accommodate the above mentioned training load. 
 
14.5   RECOMMENDATIONS 
  All the organisations under central/ state/private sector are required to impart training to their personnel at 
the institutes recognised by the Government(CEA/MoP) as mandated in Regulation 6 & 7 of CEA (measures 
relating to safety and electric supply) Regulations 2010.  
It is proposed that all Central Sector Utilities, State Sector Utilities and IPPs provide O&M and refresher 
training as per the norms stipulated in Regulation 6 & 7 of CEA (measures relating to safety and electric 
supply) Regulations 2010.  
 
  NPTI  has  been  entrusted  with  the  role  and  responsibility  as  a  National  Apex  Body  for  training  by  the 
Government of India (Gazette Notification July 3, 1993) and it runs the training programmes for the power 
sector personnel as mandated in the Regulations 6 & & of CEA Regulations 2010. NPTI’s expertise in the 
training may be utilised by all Utilities / Industries of Power Sector to meet their mandatory requirement of 
Induction training to their new entrants as well as refresher training to their existing personnel which would, 
apart from meeting their training requirement, ensure effective utilisation of the huge infrastructure available 
with the NPTI.  
  Power sector training in the areas of Smart Distribution, Smart Transmission and Smart Generation may also 
be strengthened in coordination with NPTI in order to accommodate emerging areas. This will help prepare 
competent man power for upcoming Renewable Installations of 175 GW in Solar, Wind, Small Hydro, etc. 
In compliance with the National Training Policy(NTP) of Ministry of Power, all organizations need to allocate 
training budget at least equal to 5% percent of the salary budget exclusively for funding training activities.

CHAPTER 15 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
The National Electricity Plan includes a review of the 12th Plan, detailed capacity addition requirement during the years 
2017-22  and  Perspective  Plan  projections  for  the  years  2022-27.  After  carrying  out  the  detailed  exercise  towards 
formulation of National Electricity Plan, following conclusions and recommendations have emerged. 
 
 
15.1 12TH PLAN CAPACITY ADDITION  
 
i) 
In the 12th Plan, capacity addition from conventional sources is 99,209.6 MW (Coal 83,560 MW, Lignite 1,290 
MW, Gas 6,880.5 MW, Hydro 5,479 MW, Nuclear 2,000 MW) against a target of 88,537 MW. This is about 
112% of the target. 
Private players have started playing dominant role in capacity addition in power sector with 56 % of total capacity 
addition during 12th plan coming from private sector. 
There has been considerable slippage in achievement of capacity addition target of Hydro and Nuclear sources 
(Slippage: Hydro 5,451MW and Nuclear 3,300 MW) in the  12th Plan period.   The factors affecting capacity 
addition in Hydro and Nuclear sectors need to be addressed urgently to arrest the further decline in generation 
mix. 
ii) 
iii) 
iv)  During 12th plan, capacity addition from supercritical technology based coal power plants has contributed around 
42% of the total capacity addition from coal based plants. 
R&M/LE works in respect of 37 Nos. thermal units with aggregate capacity of 7,202.6 MW have been completed 
during 12th Plan. Also about 4014.6 MW of Hydro capacity has been achieved through uprating, life extension 
and restoration activities for a total of 20 hydro R&M schemes as on 31st March,2017.  
v) 
vi)  A capacity addition of 32,741 MW from Renewable Energy Sources has been achieved during 12th Plan. 
 
15.2  DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT 
 
i)  There  would  be  reduction  in  electrical  energy  requirement  through  implementation  of  various  programs  of 
Demand  Side  Management,  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  measures  like  S&L  (Standards  &  Labelling), 
PAT (Perform-Achieve-Trade) Scheme in industries, LED domestic & Street lighting etc. 
ii)  Total  energy  savings  during  the  year  2021-22  and  2026-27  has  been  estimated  to  be  249  BU  and  337  BU 
respectively. This will result in reduction in both Electrical Energy Requirement (BU) and Peak Demand (MW). 
iii)  A uniform approach for formulation of DSM regulations (including demand response) throughout the country 
may be taken up in the Forum of Regulators.  Regulators need to notify appropriate DSM regulations and direct 
the DISCOMs to prepare time bound DSM action plan. Regulators may direct Distribution Companies to take up 
energy  efficiency  measures  in  their  areas.  The  DISCOMs  may  be  suitably  incentivized  to  implement  DSM 
projects like lighting, air-conditioning, agricultural pumps, refrigerators and ceiling fans etc. for reduction in their 
peak demand. 
 
15.3 DEMAND PROJECTIONS 
 
i)  Electricity demand of the country is periodically assessed by the Electric Power Survey Committee, taking into 
account the actual electricity demand incident on the system in the past years, planned and under implementation 
policies  and  programmes  of  the  Government,  various  developmental  activities  projected  in  future,  impact  of 
energy conservation measures etc. 
ii)  The electrical energy requirement and peak electricity demand on all-India basis has been taken as per the 19th 
EPS to work out the generation capacity addition requirement. The EPS exercise involves all stakeholders and an 
extensive exercise has been done. Distribution company wise electricity demand projection has been carried out 
to arrive at the State / region and all- India electricity demand projection. Electrical energy requirement and peak 
demand on all-India basis adopted for generation expansion planning exercise is as under:

iii) 
CAGR  of  electrical  energy  requirement  from  2016-17  to  2021-22  works  out  to  6.18  %  and  the  CAGR  of 
 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

           Central Electricity Authority 
 National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
electrical energy requirement from 2021-22 to 2026-27 works out to 5.51 %. The CAGR of electrical energy 
requirement in the country from the year 2010-11 to 2015-16 has been 5.28 %.  
Load forecasting is undertaken by  CEA once in five  years through EPS committee. While making the load 
forecasting, a number of assumptions are made. In actual, these assumptions may deviate and need suitable 
modifications.  It  is  therefore,  suggested  that  a  Mid-term  review  of  EPS  Load  Forecasting  should  be 
undertaken to help the stakeholders in the electricity sector to facilitate effective investment decisions. 
iv) 
 
 
15.4 
CAPACITY ADDITION REQUIREMENT 
 
a) 
  During the years 2017-22 
 
(i) 
Priority has been accorded towards development of hydro, nuclear and gas based projects which are already 
committed for the year 2017-22. Committed Hydro capacity addition of 6,823 MW has been considered during 
2017-22 based on assessment of progress of actual status of the projects. Nuclear capacity of 3,300 MW during 
2017-22  has  been  considered  for  planning  studies  as  per  the  information  furnished  by  DOAE.  Gas  based 
capacity of 406 MW has been considered based on the projects that are in various stages of construction. 
Considering the demand projections for the  year 2021-22 as per the 19th EPS, committed capacity addition 
from Gas 406 MW, Hydro 6,823 MW, Nuclear 3,300 MW, RES 1,17,756 MW and likely retirement of 22,716 
MW of coal based capacity during 2017-22, the study result reveals that coal based capacity addition of 6,445 
MW is required during the period 2017-22. However, a total capacity of 47,855 MW coal based power projects 
are currently under different stages of construction and are likely to yield benefits during the period 2017-22. 
Thereby, the total capacity addition during 2017-22 is likely to be 1,76,140 MW. 
(ii) 
(iii)  An alternate scenario has also been constructed considering demand CAGR of 7.18% during the years 2017-
22. It was found that 19,700 MW coal based capacity addition is required during the years 2017-22 in case of 
increased demand scenario. However, coal based capacity of 47,855 MW are at different stages of construction 
and are likely to yield benefits during 2017-22.  
In view of a large capacity addition programme from Renewable Energy Sources, Hydro and Gas based power 
stations are required to play vital role by providing balancing power to cater to the variability and uncertainty 
associated  with  Renewable  Energy  Sources.  Therefore,  suitable  measures  to  ensure  timely  completion  of 
capacity addition from hydro and adequate supply of natural gas to stranded gas based power plants may be 
taken. 
(iv) 
(v)  As per Electricity Act, 2003, CEA has to prepare National Electricity Plan for Generation and Transmission. 
The  basic  objective  of  Generation  Planning  is  to  find  out  the  ideal  generation  mix  based  on  the  demand 
projections. In view of this, an integrated approach for planning generation capacity addition involving various 
concerned ministries like MOP, MNRE, Department of Atomic Energy (DOAE) etc. needs to be adopted.  
(vi)  The rate of capacity addition particularly from coal based stations has outpaced the rate of increase in demand 
during the period from 2017-22. The PLF of the coal based stations is likely to come down to around 56.5% by 
2021-22 with likely demand under CAGR of 6.18% and 175 GW of capacity addition from RES. In the event 
of increase in demand, without any deviation in other variables like RES or coal based retirements, the PLF of 
the coal based stations will invariably increase. 
 
b) 
During the years 2022-27 
 
(i)  Priority has been accorded towards development of hydro and nuclear based projects which are already likely 
to  get  commissioned  in  the  year  2022-27.  Hydro  capacity  addition  of  12,000  MW  based  on  the  projects 
concurred by CEA has been considered during 2022-27.  Nuclear capacity of 6,800 MW during 2022-27 has 
been considered for planning  studies as per the  information furnished by DOAE. No new  gas based power 
plants has been considered during 2022-27 in view of acute natural gas shortage in the country. Import from 
neighbouring countries to the tune 21,600 MW has been considered for the studies.  
(ii)  Considering the demand projections for the year 2026-27 as per the 19th EPS, coal based capacity addition of 
47,855 MW already under construction for benefits during 2017-22, committed capacity addition of Nuclear 
6,800 MW, Hydro 12,000 MW, RES 1,00,000 MW and likely retirement of 25,572 MW of coal based capacity 
during 2022-27, study results reveals that capacity addition of 46,420 MW is required during the period 2022-
27.  This  capacity  addition  required  during  2022-27  as  shown  in  the  results  is  in  fact  the  peaking  capacity 
requirement to be met in the grid. This capacity requirement can be met from any conventional source of energy 
but preferably from peaking power plants like hydro, gas or energy storage devices. 
 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS                                
 
 
15. 2 
           Central Electricity Authority 
 National Electricity Plan 
 
 
 
(iii)  During  the  period  from  2022-27,  the  PLF  of  the  thermal  plants  shall  progressively  increase  and  would  be 
hovering around 61% by 2026-27. 
(iv)  It is expected that the share of non-fossil based installed capacity (Nuclear + Hydro + Renewable Sources) will 
be  increased  to  49.3  %  by  the  end  of  2021-22  and  will  further  increase  to  57.4%  by  the  end  of  2026-27 
considering capacity addition of 47,855 MW coal based capacity already under construction and likely to yield 
benefits during 2017-22 and 46,420 MW coal based capacity addition required   during 2022-27. 
 
 
15.5 THERMAL  
       
i) 
ii) 
India is now making a transition from power deficit to power surplus scenario. 
Avenues of exports of surplus power available in the Indian Grid to the SAARC countries need to be vigorously 
explored and pursued. 
iii)  A significant percentage of generating plants in the country is well past their useful life. They also contribute 
significantly to environmental pollution. CEA/MoP may undertake periodically a study to identify these units 
and draw up a time bound action plan for retirement of these inefficient and old units in consultation with the 
State Governments/ stakeholders.  
Retrofitting of the existing thermal plants for increased ramping capacity and  backing down capacity must be 
explored in view of integration of RES. 
Thermal  plant  in  the  vicinity  of  a  city  may  explore  the  possibility  of  using  treated  sewage  water  from 
municipalities/corporations. Proper assessment of requirement of water by the power plants and availability of 
treated water from sewage need to be made for this purpose.  
India is now having manufacturing capability of power plants related equipment to the extent of 20,000 MW per 
year. With the infusion of high quantum of RES into the grid, this full capacity may not be utilized by meeting 
the  internal  demand  of  the  country.  To  ensure  full  utilization  of  capacity,  the  manufacturing  companies  may 
explore the possibility of exporting the equipment to other countries.  This shall be consistent with the “Make in 
India” policy of the Government of India. 
iv) 
v) 
vi) 
vii)  To accommodate high quantum of RES into the grid, thermal plants are likely to run at low PLF in future. Many 
plants may get partial/nil schedule of generation. Market mechanisms like ancillary services needs to be evolved 
through regulatory intervention so that the owners of thermal plants are able to use some of the stranded capacity. 
viii)  The electricity grid is undergoing rapid transformation in terms of net load characteristics after accommodating 
the variability of RES. Conventional power plants must have rapid ramping and backing down capability. It is 
proposed that the ramping and backing down characteristics of different categories of conventional generating 
units are spelt out in the CEA standard. A conventional unit should demonstrate its ramping and backing down 
capability before it is declared under commercial operation.  
ix)  To  harness  the  balancing  potential  of  the  existing  power  plants,  it  is  essential  to  develop  market  mechanism 
through regulatory intervention.  The market must provide proper price signal to the potential stakeholders in the 
grid to willingly participate in the balancing market. 
x)  Gas  based  power  stations  are  best  suited  after  hydro  power  plants  (including  PSPs)  for  providing  balancing 
requirements of the grid due to integration of RES. Therefore, adequate gas should be made available for effective 
utilization of existing gas based stations.  
15.6 FUEL REQUIREMENTS 
 
i) 
For the year 2017-18, coal based generation programme of 958 BU has been estimated in consultation of the 
power utilities.  The total coal requirement of 630 MT for the power plants has been estimated considering 
normal monsoon year during the year 2017-18. 
The total coal requirement in the year 2021-22 and 2026-27 has been estimated as 735 MT (Base case) and 877 
MT respectively including imported coal of 50 MT. The coal requirement for the year 2021-22 and 2026-27 
has  been  worked  out  considering  30%  reduction  in  Hydro  generation  due  to  failure  of  monsoon  and  being 
supplemented by coal based generation. 
Against a total domestic gas allocated to power projects of 87.05 MMSCMD, total gas supplied to these gas 
based power plants during the year 2016-17 was only 29.59 MMSCMD. 
It has been estimated that the gas based power stations shall need at least 45.27 MMSCMD of gas to meet the 
balancing and peaking requirement of the grid. 
The scheme for utilisation of stranded gas based generation capacity introduced by Government of India is for 
two  years  only.  However,  a  long  term  policy  intervention  is  required  for  optimal  utilization  of  gas  based 
capacity in the country.

vi) 
The regasification capacity in the country is also a matter of concern for gas based power plants, particularly 
for those who are connected with RGTIL East-West pipeline. Due to technical constraints like directional flows 
etc., imported RLNG from west coast cannot be transported to power plants located in the East Coast.Therefore, 
facility of re-gasification capacity may be suitably created at East coast also. 
 
 
15.7  HYDRO   
 
i) 
Even though India is endowed with vast potential of hydro power, the development of hydro power has not 
taken place as per the planned capacity addition. In fact, the % of hydro capacity in the overall Installed capacity 
of the country has been registering a steady decline. The hydro development is plagued with many problems 
like land acquisition, R&R issues, environmental and forest clearance etc. Now, the need for capacity addition 
in hydro power is felt all the more with the rapid capacity addition in RES. Pumped storage and run of the river 
(with pondage) type of hydro power plants are ideal to meet the ramping and balancing requirement of the grid. 
In view of this, appropriate measures must be taken to address the problems associated with the hydro power 
development in the country. 
ii)  At present India is having 9 no. of PSPs with a total installed capacity of 4,786 MW. However, of these only 5 
no. of PSP having IC of 2,600 MW are operational.  Others hydro power plants are not working in pumping 
mode due to a variety of reasons. The swing available from generation mode to pumping mode and vice versa 
in a pumped storage plant is an effective tool in the hands of the grid operators for grid management. Installation 
of more number of PSPs and ensuring that the existing PSPs are capable of running as PSPs, is the need of the 
hour.  Suitable policy may be framed for encouraging and exploiting pump storage potential of the country. It 
is  proposed  that,  for  the  sake  of  grid  stabilization,  effective  control  of  operation  of  these  plants  by 
RLDCs/SLDCs needs to be evolved in consultation with States/Developers/Regulators. 
iii)  Most  hydro  power  plants  have  the  ability  to  provide  balancing  power  to  manage  variability  associated  with 
variable Renewable Energy (Solar and Wind). However, their participation in the above has been lukewarm as 
no financial incentive exists today on this account. There is no distinction between peak and off-peak tariff of a 
hydro plant. Therefore, suitable price signal needs to be generated to induce voluntary participation of the hydro 
plants in balancing requirement of the grid. Further, it is also proposed that infrastructure cost from the hydro 
project may be excluded for the purpose of determination of tariff. 
 
 
15.8  RENEWABLE ENERGY 
i) 
India has achieved a total installed capacity of 57,244.24 MW from Renewable Energy Sources as on 31.3.2017. 
ii)  The country  has revised its Renewable Energy capacity target to 175 GW by 2022 in view of the significant 
renewable energy potential in the country. 
iii)  Accelerated  development  of  RES  requires  adequate  indigenous  manufacturing  facility  for  RES  related 
equipment.  Policy  framework  may  be  developed  to  encourage  setting  up  of  RES  related  equipment 
manufacturing facility in the country This would be consistent with the Government of India’s “Make in India” 
policy. 
 
15.9 KEY INPUTS 
i)  Adequate manufacturing facilities exist in India for main plant equipment. However, lack of orders is a concern 
of all equipment manufacturers.  
ii)  A  joint  mechanism  may  be  created  under  Ministry  of  Steel  with  participation  from  power  equipment 
manufacturers and steel manufacturers for more information sharing on compositions/properties of various steels 
and steel products required and their indigenous development by the steel industry. 
iii)  An organizational mechanism for information sharing on BoP vendors across industries needs to be considered.  
Such a mechanism could provide the details on orders in hand, T&P available, past performance etc. This could 
be a web based portal under DHI or Ministry of Commerce. 
iv)  New  advanced  technologies  based  BoP  systems  like  High  Concentration  Slurry  Disposal  (HCSD)  type  ash 
disposal systems, closed pipe type conveyors for coal handling plants (CHP), large size Reverse Osmosis systems 
also need to be indigenized.  
v)  ODC movement continues to be a major constraint. Thus, the suggestion of manufacturers towards adoption of 
standardized maximum axle weight of around 16 MT/axle with no approvals required thereafter, single window 
clearance system for ODCs or undertaking a National Bridge Up-gradation Programme for upgradation of all 
bridges  to  minimum  strength  facilitating  ODC  movements  need  to  be  considered  to  remove  the  constraints 
prevailing in ODC movements.

vi) 
Inland waterways can become an attractive mode of transportation in conjunction with Railways. The success of 
NTPC coal transportation to Farakka could be replicated across numerous other stations.  
vii)  The prevailing regasification capacity for LNG in the country stands at about 21 Million metric tons per annum 
(MMTPA) – further expansions are being planned by several players. Also additional 15,000 km, of gas pipelines 
are under construction for completion of national Gas grid. 
 
viii)  Future Infrastructure Project in railway line, Port development will be done through PPP mode. 
ix)  Task Force may be created under NTPC with participation from equipment manufacturers/EPC contractors and 
utilities to examine the issue of pace of project execution in detail and work out an optimized framework of site 
preparation, T&P requirements etc. for overall improvement in project execution. 
 
15.10  FUND REQUIREMENTS 
 
i)  The total fund requirement for capacity addition is estimated to be ₹ 11,55,652 crores during the period 2017-2022, 
which includes the RES capacity addition, as well as the expenditure done  during this period for the projects 
coming up in the year 2022-27. 
ii)  The  total  fund  requirement  is  estimated  to  be  ₹  9,56,214  crores  for  the  period  2022-27  and  does  not  include 
advance action for projects coming up during the period 2027-2032. 
 
15.11  ENVIRONMENT  
 
i)  The total CO2 emissions projected for the year 2021-22 and 2026-27 is 1026 Million Tonnes and 1173 Million 
Tonnes respectively. 
ii)  The average emission  factor from  grid connected power stations during 2015-16  was 0.721 kg CO2/kWh. It  is 
expected to reduce to 0.604 kg CO2/kWh in the year 2021-22 and to 0.524 kg CO2/kWh by the end of 2026-27.  
iii) Emission intensity kgCO2/GDP (₹) from grid connected power stations is likely to reduce by 40.51 % by the end 
of 2021-22 and   53.65 % by the end of 2026-27 from the year 2005 level. 
iv) It is estimated that 20.69 Million Tonnes of CO2 emissions have been avoided by 31.03.2017 due to commissioning 
of  Super-critical  technology  based  coal  power  plants  vis-à-vis  the  scenario  of  only  subcritical  units  had  been 
commissioned. 
v)  It is estimated that about 268 Million Tonnes of CO2 emission will be avoided annually by the end of the year 
2021-22 from renewable energy sources. 
vi) Country has achieved 60.97% of fly ash utilisation in the years 2015-16. In terms of absolute value, the same stands 
at 107.77  million tonnes.  
  vii)Detailed unit-wise feasibility study covering all factors like technology, investment, time frame, suitability in Indian 
context etc. may be carried out. 
 
15.12  R & D in POWER SECTOR 
 
There are many problems in  Indian power  sector  which are specific to Indian conditions. Through promotion of 
R&D, these specific problem areas need to be addressed. It is suggested that CEA may act as an interface between 
Industry and academics for this purpose. An advisory group may be created for promotion of R&D activities in the 
country with a permanent cell at CEA.  The advisory group may have members drawn from Government, Dominant 
players  in  the  field  of  Generation,  Transmission  and  Distribution  sectors  like  NTPC,  NHPC,  BHEL,  Powergrid, 
CESC etc., Research institutions like CPRI and Academic Institutions like IISc/IITs/ NITs. 
 
15.13  HUMAN RESOURCE 
 
i)  Sufficient number of Engineers, Managers and Diploma holders are available in the country. However, there 
are gaps in respect of lower level skills like that of ITI. 
ii)  It is proposed that all Central Sector Utilities, all State Sector Utilities and all IPPs should create sufficient 
Training infrastructure as per the norms stipulated in notification of September 2010 issued by CEA.  
iii) CEA  has  recognized  about  74  Training  Institutes  spread  all  across  the  country.  These  institutes  may  be 
strengthened for Distribution/Lineman training along with training in renewable sector such as solar, wind etc.  
iv) As per National Training Policy of MoP all organizations need to allocate training budget at least equal to 5%   
of salary budget exclusively for funding training activities.
