Foreword
from the President of the
Executive Hydroelectric Commission
of the Lempa River
For 75 years, the Executive Hydroelectric Commission of the Lempa River (CEL) has positioned itself as a benchmark in 
power generation in El Salvador, creating important hydropower and geothermal energy projects that for several years 
have contributed to the economy of the country as well as to improve the quality of life of millions of Salvadorans. Since 
its creation, CEL has directed its efforts in the country’s development through the energy output of four hydropower 
plants, with coverage across a broad area of national territory. Historically, these power plants enabled the electrification 
of the country, giving rise to national industrialisation and, in turn, the steady growth we see today.
Over  time,  CEL  has  created  programmes  that  contribute  to  environmental  conservation,  improving  landscapes, 
caring for ecosystems, and developing social initiatives to enhance the capacities of the most vulnerable, reflecting 
principles that must always be considered when exploring and developing new sustainable energy projects. CEL 
has diversified its business  to include renewables, including geothermal projects undertaken through its subsidiary 
company LaGeo, which has set international standards, training professionals from Latin American countries who 
seek to explore and promote this so-called “white gold”.
Under the government of President Nayib Bukele, CEL and its companies have taken on another key role, initiating 
projects to reduce the price of electricity for the Salvadoran people and boost the economy, even in the midst of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. This is why CEL is working to explore, create and promote renewable power generation 
through geothermal, solar photovoltaic, wind and hydropower projects. One ongoing flagship project focuses on 
constructing  the  new  ‘3  de  febrero’  hydropower  plant.  This  efficient,  transparently  managed  dam  project,  when 
completed, will further boost the Salvadoran energy mix while also bringing other benefits, such as job creation and 
enhanced tourism development.
The  efforts  of  CEL  and  others  in  initiating  the  energy  transition  have  also  benefited  from  the  support  of  the 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), with which we have been working for some years in a co-ordinated 
and synergistic way. This co-operation will allow us to continue strengthening our endeavours to scale up renewable 
energy.  The  Renewables  Readiness  Assessment  (RRA)  for  El  Salvador  provides  a  key  milestone  that  aims  to 
promote new initiatives and instruments, particularly to improve the efficiency of public policies and regulations on 
energy. Even in the midst of a pandemic, this assessment can help to create suitable conditions for the widespread, 
sustainable deployment of renewables in El Salvador.
Consequently, the recommendations are in line with the government’s energy policy, which proposes increasing public 
investment in projects to develop and use new renewable energy sources, as well as reviewing and reconfiguring the 
country’s energy mix. On behalf of our President and the Government of El Salvador, I wish to express the greatest 
appreciation  for  IRENA’s  valuable  and  constant  support,  as  well  as  for  the  honour  conferred  on  the  Republic  of 
El Salvador in holding the Vice Presidency of the IRENA Assembly in 2020.

FOREWORD
Foreword
from the Executive Secretary
of the National Energy Council 
The main renewable resources used in El Salvador for electricity generation are geothermal and hydropower. While 
variable  renewable  power  is  growing  considerably,  there  is  much  more  potential  for  these  resources,  either  for 
electricity  or  direct  uses.  This  report,  prepared  with  the  support  of  the  International  Renewable  Energy  Agency 
(IRENA) identifies the conditions to expand the use of renewables nationally.
Input from multiple stakeholders in the Salvadorian energy sector has been key in identifying priorities for action in 
key sectors like agriculture, industry, tourism and health, aimed at utilising solar, geothermal and biomass resources, 
driving decentralised economic development, and ensuring environmental and social benefits in the short, medium 
and long term.
El  Salvador  adheres  to  environmental  commitments  under  international  agreements.  Its  national  policy  aims  to 
further deepen the energy transition, with a view to ensuring a sustainable energy supply, strengthen our economy, 
bring widespread benefits to the Salvadoran population while increasing our resilience to climate change.
The National Energy Council continues to work on updating institutional and regulatory frameworks to promote 
optimal resource use and the efficient implementation of appropriate technologies. We reiterate our gratitude to 
IRENA, as well as to all the stakeholders involved in the development of this assessment. We reaffirm our commitment 
to develop enabling initiatives for renewables in all sectors and position El Salvador as a reference case in the use of 
renewable energy.

Foreword
from the IRENA
Director-General
The Republic of El Salvador, like other countries in Central America, the Latin American region and around the world, 
faces  unprecedented  health  and  socio-economic  challenges  amid  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Beyond  short-term 
recovery measures, the national response has started to focus on longer-term measures, such as ensuring energy 
security, aligning new investments with climate commitments and building a resilient economy. The decarbonisation 
of  El  Salvador’s  energy  sector  can  pave  the  way  for  broad-based,  sustainable  socio-economic  development  in 
years to come. For now, the growing demand for energy continues to be met mainly through oil imports. However, 
indigenously sourced renewables are assuming a larger role.
The new National Energy Policy 2020-2050 aims to diversify El Salvador’s energy mix and take advantage of the 
country’s significant renewable energy resource potential. At the same time, the policy highlights the need to reduce 
dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the impact of climate change. This means adopting energy storage, efficiency 
measures, digitalisation and other innovative technologies, as well as promoting renewables beyond the power sector.
This Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA), prepared through a broad-based consultative process in close co-
operation with the Executive Hydroelectric Commission of the Lempa River (CEL) and the National Energy Council 
(CNE),  examines  El  Salvador’s  energy  sector  holistically.  The  report  identifies  key  actions  to  expand  renewable 
energy development in the short and medium term. Discussions with stakeholder have also heightened knowledge 
exchange and fostered international co-operation to promote clean, indigenous renewable energy technologies.
The report examines planning and operations, the existing regulatory framework and the financing mechanisms that 
could come into play to achieve the country’s long-term renewable energy ambitions. The assessment underlines 
the role of the Central American power market and ongoing regional energy integration, in line with IRENA’s Clean 
Energy Corridor of Central America (CECCA) initiative. 
Since 2011, nearly 40 countries, spanning the Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and 
the Pacific have undertaken RRAs, exchanging knowledge and fostering international co-operation to accelerate 
the deployment of renewables. Each process has been country-led, with IRENA providing technical expertise and 
highlighting regional and global insights, along with facilitating national stakeholder consultations.
IRENA wishes to thank CEL, CNE and all Salvadorian energy institutions for their vital input and engagement. We 
also appreciate the valuable contributions of numerous other government agencies and national stakeholders. We 
look forward to working with all of them, as well as with regional institutions and development partners, to turn these 
recommendations into practical on-the-ground initiatives that promote renewables as a key element in sustainable, 
equitable socio-economic development.
I  sincerely  hope  this  report  and  its  recommendations  will  strengthen  El  Salvador’s  pursuit  of  renewables  and 
enhanced climate action. IRENA stands ready to assist in the country’s transition to a sustainable energy future.

Executive summary
El Salvador depends heavily on fossil fuels to meet its 
energy needs for industry, transport and, to a certain 
extent,  power  generation.  Increasingly,  the  country 
also  imports  electricity  from  neighbouring  countries 
to  meet  domestic  demand.  Renewable  energy  use  – 
already seen in hydropower and geothermal projects 
– could therefore be scaled up further and faster in the 
Central American country. 
The General Electricity Law of 1996, which liberalised 
the power sector, also allowed for more private sector 
participation 
in  renewable  energy  development, 
alongside the government’s more active promotion of 
renewable energy sources. 
The National Energy Policy 2010-2024 then became a 
key tool for the implementation of renewable energy, 
especially in the power sector. Indeed, no new fossil-
fuel based power generators have been added since 
2013.  By  2019,  renewables,  including  hydropower, 
biomass,  solar  photovoltaic  (PV)  and  geothermal 
power,  had  reached  64.3%  of  the  country’s  total 
installed capacity of 2.2 gigawatts (GW). Since 2015, 
solar  PV  capacity  alone  has  grown  nearly  tenfold, 
reaching 273 megawatts (MW) in 2019.
Encouragingly,  the  past  decade  has  seen  national 
energy  policy  recognise  the  benefits  of  developing 
solar, wind and bioenergy, as a wide range of renewable 
energy technologies can help to diversify the energy 
mix, expand electricity access and strengthen regional 
energy integration.
El  Salvador’s  economy,  based  mainly  on  services, 
industry  and  agriculture,  grew  by  an  estimated  2.4% 
in  2019,  within  a  moderate  average  annual  growth 
rate of its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of 
3.9%  over  the  last  20  years.  Regardless  of  persistent 
challenges,  El  Salvador  has  made  substantial  social 
and economic progress over the last two decades, with 
national policies increasingly mirroring with the United 
Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Additionally,  El  Salvador  is  connected  to  the  Central 
American  Electrical  Interconnection  System  (SIEPAC 
–  Sistema  de  Interconexión  Eléctrica  de  los  Países 
de  América  Central),  making  the  country  an  active 
participant  in  the  Regional  Electricity  Market  (MER 
–  Mercado  Eléctrico  Regional).  Electricity  imports, 
mainly from Guatemala, accounted for around 21% of 
the country’s electricity supply in 2019.
With  no  domestic  oil,  gas  or  coal  supply,  the 
country  depends  entirely  on  imported  fossil  fuels, 
which  accounted  for  69%  of  its  total  energy  supply 
in  2019.  Yet  the  energy  sector  continues  to  be 
recognised  as  a  strong  contributor  to  economic 
and  social  development.  The  country  has  prioritised 
the  development  of  renewables  to  mitigate  import 
improve  energy  security. 
dependency  and  thus 
Renewables  are  also  expected  to  stimulate  local 
commerce and industry, help reduce electricity tariffs 
and improve people’s welfare.
The National Energy Council (CNE – Consejo Nacional 
de  Energía)  is  currently  developing  its  long  term 
National  Energy  Policy  2020-2050.  This  aims  to 
reduce the electricity tariff through added renewable 
power generation, facilitating the removal of electricity 
subsidies  towards  the  end  of  the  policy  period.  This 
new  strategy  goes  beyond  the  power  sector,  too, 
stipulating  targets  for  clean  energy  technologies 
in  end-use  sectors  and  energy  efficiency,  as  well  as 
promoting pilot projects for direct use of renewables 
in the industrial and agri-food sectors.
12
The  country’s  Renewables  Readiness  Assessment 
(RRA) process has highlighted key actions for the short 
and  medium-term  that  could  create  more  conducive 
conditions  for  renewable  energy  deployment.  The 
country-led assessment, facilitated by the International 
Renewable  Energy  Agency  (IRENA),  aims  to  help 
unlock  El  Salvador’s  renewable  energy  potential.  The 
identified actions are grouped in five areas, where the 
main challenges have been identified.
for  direct  uses.  A  more  in-depth  review  of  the 
regulatory  framework  could  also  help  to  overcome 
challenges with the existing remuneration scheme, as 
well as the licensing procedure currently in place for 
geothermal projects.
Likewise,  geothermal  project  developers  struggle 
to  access  financing  options,  underlining  the  need 
to  further  enhance  the  capabilities  of  local  financial 
institutions and project owners to help create a better 
understanding of funding geothermal projects and its 
associated risks.
Challenges and key recommendations
1.  Enhance long-term planning and policy for  
the renewable energy sector
3.   Establish clear institutional frameworks 
 
 
and co-ordination 
 
Competitive  tendering  processes  and  various  fiscal 
incentives  for  renewable  electricity  have  helped  to 
create  good  business  conditions  for  renewables  in 
El Salvador, resulting in significant uptake of renewable 
energy technologies.
Currently,  responsibilities  among  institutions  in  the 
country’s energy sector remain decentralised, which is 
affecting the performance of the sector and is clearly 
reflected in the absence of longer term co-ordination 
of different participants’ action plans. El Salvador may 
consider  several  options  to  improve  this  condition, 
including  the  creation  of  an  entity  that  centralises 
sector development and directives. 
rapid 
Yet 
renewable  energy  development  has 
highlighted  insufficient  co-ordination  in  terms  of 
long-term  energy  plans.  El  Salvador  could  devise 
a  more  comprehensive  national  energy  plan, 
encompassing all energy technologies, suppliers and 
consumers through an integrated analysis of current 
market conditions. The plan should also consider the 
integration of renewable energy technologies for end 
uses in buildings, heat and transport, while establishing 
clear targets that contribute to the ongoing scale-up 
of renewables.
Additionally, 
the  national 
the  development  of 
transmission  system  and  of  new  generation  facilities 
are undertaken separately. Potential new renewable-
based power generation, therefore, is not consistently 
included in transmission expansion plans. Such plans, 
moreover,  tend  to  overlook  the  short  construction 
times needed for solar and wind (variable renewable 
energy) facilities. 
El  Salvador  benefited  greatly  from  regional  energy 
integration  and  plays  an  active  role  in  the  MER.  The 
country  should  therefore  incorporate  the  Regional 
Energy  Strategy  2030  in  its  national  long-term 
planning efforts. This is in line with the country’s overall 
development strategy and assures the participation of 
both public and private sectors.
Measures  are  needed  to  ensure  closer  collaboration 
between the entities responsible for developing such 
plans.  For  instance,  the  identification  of  renewable 
energy  zones  in  the  most  suitable  areas  for  project 
development could serve to inform both transmission 
and  generation  planners,  facilitating  a  co-ordinated 
planning effort.
2.   Create enabling conditions for  
4.   Assess the implementation of 
distributed power generation
 
 
 
 
geothermal energy development
 
 
Despite having a long tradition of geothermal energy 
use,  El  Salvador’s  geothermal  development  has 
stagnated  in  recent  years,  with  a  limited  number  of 
new  projects  for  geothermal  power  generation,  or 
heating applications.
The  implementation  of  the  net  metering  scheme 
in  2017  has  resulted  in  a  successful  promotion  of 
rooftop solar PV generation. Yet, there is still no clear 
understanding  of  the  effects  that  the  growing  self-
generation practice has on the reliability of the power 
system and the overall energy market.
El  Salvador’s  geothermal  potential  could  be  also 
utilised  for  direct-use  applications,  but  the  existing 
regulatory framework only covers power applications. 
Classifications need to be established for geothermal 
resources by temperature, including varying potential 
To improve this, all existing use of self-generation must 
first  be  registered.  This  should  consider  both  self-use 
and the potential injection of energy into the grid from 
existing  projects.  This  exercise  could  provide  a  better 
13
assessment of the existing regulatory framework, while 
considering  the  stability  of  the  grid  and  the  existing 
distribution market, as well as empowering end users 
for relatively flexible energy management.
El  Salvador’s  long-term  uptake  of  renewable  energy 
technologies  will  also  hinge  on  assessing  the 
availability, along with the potential for improvement 
and  expansion,  of  existing  financing  instruments. 
Existing  mechanisms  and  conditions  for  financing 
and  risk  mitigation  by  private  institutions,  similarly, 
must  be  clear  to  ensure  that  project  developers  can 
make  use  of  these  instruments.  Additionally,  local 
private  institutions  will  need  to  be  familiarised  with 
the renewable energy market to attract more interest 
from them in project finance. 
5.   Foster project development and 
 
 
financing for renewables
 
There have been significant achievements and progress 
in  regulation  for  the  development  of  renewable 
energy in El Salvador. Renewable project developers 
still  face  challenges,  however,  with  administrative 
procedures  and  permits.  These  are  not  centralised 
and cause delays in project development. Regulation 
in  this  area  must  ensure  transparent  processes  and 
well-defined  timetables  for  obtaining  permits.  A 
unified  national  office  (or  “single-window  agency”) 
should be established to handle all applicable licenses 
and permits for renewable energy projects, reducing 
project delays and development costs.

The 
these  steps, 
collaboration  with  all  national  and 
regional 
stakeholders  from  the  private  and  public  sector, 
should  help  El  Salvador  attract  investments  that 
contribute  towards  a  climate  resilient,  low-emission 
development pathway.

1.  Introduction
Country background
2010, however, the growth rate has been slowly rising 
(see Figure 1). 
With a land area covering only 21 040 square kilometres 
(km2),  El  Salvador  is  Central  America’s  smallest 
country. Bordering Guatemala to the west, Honduras 
to  the  east,  and  the  Pacific  Ocean  to  the  south,  in 
2018, El Salvador had an estimated population of just 
over 6.4 million. This gave it a high population density, 
at 309.4 inhabitants per km2 (UN, 2018). 
In fiscal year (FY) 2019, El Salvador’s gross domestic 
product (GDP) per capita at purchasing power parity 
(PPP) was around USD 9 140. As shown in Figure 2, 
this  number  has  been  rising  in  recent  years,  with  an 
average annual growth rate of 3.9% from FY 2001 to 
FY  2019.  This  was,  however,  one  of  the  lowest  rates 
of  growth  in  Central  America  (World  Bank,  2020b). 
Higher  private  consumption  and  a  peak  in  gross 
investment boosted annual average growth to 4.3% in 
FY 2006, while GDP shrank 2.1% in FY 2009, following 
the global financial crisis.
Overall, annual population growth in the country was 
low between 2000 and 2019, when compared to the 
regional average in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
with  the  rate  falling  between  2000  and  2010.  Since

In FY 2018 and FY 2019, the Salvadoran economy saw 
annual GDP growth of 2.5% and 2.3% respectively. The 
largest contribution to the country’s GDP traditionally 
comes from the services sector, followed by industry, 
manufacture and agriculture. An overview of the key 
economic indicators from 2014 to 2019 can be found 
in Table 1. 
loans (UN ECLAC, 2017). This was reflected in the national 
poverty  rate,  which  declined  from  38.8%  in  2000  to 
29.2% in 2017 (DIGESTYC, 2018). The still relatively high 
poverty rate is the result of both the country’s low overall 
economic growth and trends in migration to urban areas.
The national deficit stood at approximately 2% of GDP 
in  2017,  down  from  3.6%  in  2015  (UN  ECLAC,  2017). 
This decrease follows a reduced national oil bill, given 
that El Salvador imports all its oil products and is thus 
highly dependent on international oil prices. 
The economy has also benefited from an improvement 
in real wages, stronger flows of worker remittances and 
an  increase  in  private  consumption,  including  personal

The  Central  Reserve  Bank  of  El  Salvador  does  not 
have complete monetary autonomy. This is due to the 
adoption of the United States dollar as the formal unit 
of currency, a policy in force since 2001, as well as the 
free  mobility  of  capital.  As  a  result,  the  supply  and 
demand for US dollars between locally-based financial 
intermediaries  is  the  main  determinant  of  interest 
rates, in the short term. These intermediaries reported 
stable liquidity conditions in 2016. (UN ECLAC, 2017).
El  Salvador  is  pursuing  the  UN  2030  Agenda  for 
Sustainable  Development  by  including  it  as  part  of  its 
national  development  strategy.  The  co-ordination  of 
actions  related  to  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals 
(SDGs) is led by the Presidency, with the support of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (SDGs Knowledge Platform – 
UN, n.d.).
Regarding SDG7 – ensuring access to affordable, reliable, 
sustainable  and  modern  energy  for  all  –  El  Salvador 
has  made  impressive  progress.  Figure  3  presents  the 
country’s access to electricity rates, with these reaching 
around 97% in 2018, compared to 95.4% in 2015.
Over  the  last  two  decades,  El  Salvador  has  made 
substantial  progress 
its  social  and  political 
development.  The  country  has  expanded  access  to 
its  public  services,  which  has  directly  contributed 
to  improved  living  conditions,  including  enhanced 
energy  services.  Despite  this  progress,  however, 
the  country’s  long-term  sustainable  development 
continues  to  face  challenges,  including  threats  from 
adverse  natural  events,  environmental  degradation 
and climate change (World Bank, 2020b).
in 
Other  SDG7  indicators  reflect  the  country’s  effort  to 
achieve  sustainable  development  across  the  energy 
sector.  By  2016,  88%  of  the  population  had  access  to 
clean  cooking,  while  the  same  year,  energy  efficiency 
had  improved  to  4  megajoules  (MJ)  per  USD  of  GDP 
(UNStats, n.d.).

Renewables Readiness Assessment 
(RRA) in El Salvador 
operators,  financial  institutions,  development  partners, 
regional  organisations,  civil  society  and  academia, 
among others. 
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) 
has developed its Renewables Readiness Assessment 
(RRA)  as  a  tool  for  carrying  out  a  comprehensive 
evaluation  of  the  conditions  for  renewable  energy 
deployment in a given country. 
The  consultative  process  was  launched  during  a 
meeting of experts held in the country’s capital, San 
Salvador,  in  December  2018.  This  was  based  on  a 
background  paper,  which  described  the  challenges 
and  opportunities 
for  renewables  development. 
The  outcomes  of  these  discussions  facilitated  the 
identification  of  various  challenges  hindering  the 
deployment  of  renewable  energy  in  the  country,  as 
well as possible solutions to these impediments. 
The  RRA  is  a  country-led,  consultative  process, 
providing  a  venue  for  multi-stakeholder  dialogue 
in 
renewable  energy 
deployment.  The  assessment  then  tries  to  come  up 
with solutions to existing barriers. 
identifying  challenges 
in 
The  challenges 
identified  were  grouped  and 
assessed in a series of short and medium-term draft 
recommendations.  These  were  then  presented  at 
a  follow-up  validation  workshop  held  in  October 
2019  and  jointly  organised  by  CEL  and  IRENA,  with 
CNE’s  support.  The  main  outcome  of  the  discussion 
at  this  meeting  was  the  validation  of  the  challenges 
identified, along with the proposed recommendations, 
with these to be compiled in the final RRA report. This 
process also benefitted from bilateral interviews with 
key stakeholders.
short  and  medium-term 
The  RRA  presents 
recommendations to governments to help guide the 
formation of new policies and regulations, or to reform 
existing  ones.  The  aim  is  to  create  a  more  enabling 
environment for the deployment of renewable energy. 
The  RRA  also  consolidates  existing  efforts  and 
mobilises resources for priority action.
For the Republic of El Salvador, the RRA process has been 
led  by  the  Executive  Hydroelectric  Commission  of  the 
Lempa  River  (CEL  –  Comisión  Ejecutiva  Hidroeléctrica 
del  Río  Lempa),  in  co-ordination  with  the  National 
Energy Council (CNE – Consejo Nacional de Energía) and 
with technical support from IRENA. The process involved 
extensive consultations with a large group of public and 
private  energy  stakeholders,  including  the  ministries, 
the  regulator,  generation  companies,  transmission  and 
distribution  utilities,  project  developers,  energy  market 
The  co-ordinated  approach  employed  in  producing 
this RRA, which saw consultation with governmental 
institutions,  bilateral  and  multilateral  co-operation 
agencies,  financial  institutions,  the  private  sector, 
regional  organisations,  civil  society  and  academia, 
helps  set  priorities  for  implementing  the  actions 
recommended.
Renewables and COVID-19 recovery
The COVID-19 outbreak has led the countries around the world to an unprecedented economic, health and 
social  crisis.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  estimates  a  resultant  contraction  of  the  economies  in 
Central America of around 3.5 percent average during 2020. These new regional conditions are undermining 
the economic growth of El Salvador, however the new National Energy Policy 2020-2050 and the ongoing 
efforts towards the revision of the NDCs by the country, are creating an opportunity to centrally position the 
Salvadorian  energy  sector  at  the  core  of  the  post-COVID  recovery,  focusing  its  efforts  to  achieve  a  green 
recovery. Renewable energy serves as an opportunity to increase energy security, attract investment to the 
country and developing into a long-term source of jobs for its inhabitants. Additionally, investing in domestic 
renewable energy infrastructure offers the potential to boost health capacity and build climate resilience. It 
can also greatly strengthen El Salvador’s post-COVID recovery efforts.

2.  Energy context
Energy sector overview 
Diesel has a high level of consumption, mainly in the 
transport  and  industrial  sectors.  Gasoline  is  used 
exclusively  for  the  transport  sector,  while  fuel  oil  or 
bunker  fuel  is  used  for  the  generation  of  electricity. 
Natural  gas  does  not  have  a  relevant  role  in  the 
country’s energy mix, yet. In 2021, however, a liquefied 
natural  gas  (LNG)  power  plant  is  expected  to  be 
commissioned, giving this resource a more prominent 
role in the energy sector (see Section 3).
The bulk of El Salvador’s primary energy comes from 
fossil fuels. As shown in Figure 4, the total energy supply 
sources  since  2010  have  mainly  been  oil  derivatives, 
such  as  gasoline,  diesel,  liquid  petroleum  gas  (LPG), 
kerosene and bunker fuel (CNE, 2020). The total fossil 
supply accounted for a total 108 721 terajoules (TJ) in 
2019, or 69% of the total energy supply.

Figure 5. Total energy supply, 2019 [%]
In  2019,  total  energy  supply  in  El  Salvador  reached 
around  156 600  TJ  (see  Figure  5).  That  year,  the 
renewable  energy  source  with  the  largest  share  as 
part  of  the  primary  energy  supply  was  bioenergy 
(19.6%), followed by hydropower (3.5%), geothermal 
energy (3.4%), and solar energy (1.1%) (CNE, 2020).

the  industrial  and  residential  sectors  (Figure  6). 
Final  energy  consumption  in  the  transport  sector 
increased from 43 126 TJ in 2010 to 60 710 TJ in 2019, 
with  the  sector’s  overall  share  growing  from  42%  to 
45%  over  the  same  period.  Between  2010  and  2019, 
the  residential  and  commercial  sectors’  shares  fell, 
reaching  21%  and  6%  respectively,  in  2019  (CNE,

Power sector 
In 2019, conventional thermal capacity stood at 35.7%, 
followed  by  hydropower  (26.9%),  biomass  (14.9%), 
solar  photovoltaic  (PV)  (12.9%)  and  geothermal 
(9.6%). Since 2015, solar PV capacity has grown nearly 
tenfold, reaching 273 MW in 2019 (including off-grid 
generation).  Moreover,  solar  PV  and  wind  energy 
capacity is expected to grow in the coming years, as 
multiple projects are in the pipeline.
Electricity supply and demand
With  2018  seeing  the  achievement  of  an  electricity 
access  rate  of  97%,  El  Salvador  is  close  to  universal 
access  across  the  country  (UN  ECLAC,  2020).  The 
remaining  population  without  access  to  electricity  is 
located in rural areas that are widely scattered.
Figure 8. Electricity consumption per capita 
From  2000  to  2014,  electricity  consumption  per 
capita  grew  from  about  615  to  937  kilowatt  hours 
(kWh),  following  the  same  trend  as  the  per  capita 
GDP (Figure 8).

As shown in Figure 9, in 2019, total installed capacity 
in El Salvador reached 2.2 gigawatts (GW) (including 
off-grid generation). In the last five years, the average 
annual growth rate of total installed capacity has been 
around  6%.  Since  2013,  however,  there  have  been 
no  new  additions  of  conventional  thermal  capacity 
(which  in  El  Salvador  has  traditionally  corresponded 
to  fuel  oil  and  bunker  fuel).  Yet,  this  type  of  power 
generation still has the largest share among all energy 
sources.

in  Figure  9  and  peak  demand  in  Figure  10,  is  given 
by  the  nominal  installed  capacity  and  the  reliability 
of  generation.  Thermal  power  plants  are  at  present 
used  as  a  back-up  for  variable  renewable  energy 
(VRE)  generation.  Thermal  electricity  production 
in  El  Salvador  is,  however,  sometimes  costlier  than 
importing  electricity  within  the  regional  market,  as 
will be presented in the section below. 
As of 2018, El Salvador’s power system consisted of 25 
power  plants  located  around  the  country  (Appendix 
2).  These  are  interconnected  with  the  electricity 
transmission  system  and  operate  in  the  wholesale 
market.  This  generating  fleet  is  composed  of  four 
hydropower plants operated by CEL (552.7 MW); two 
geothermal  plants  operated  by  LaGeo  (204.4  MW), 
ten  thermal  power  plants  (757.1  MW),  where  one  is 
state  owned  and  operated  by  Energy  Investments 
(INE  –  Inversiones  Energéticas);  five  biomass  power 
plants (293.6 MW)1 and one solar PV plant (60 MW). In 
total, 45.9% of the total power generation capacity in 
El Salvador is state owned. A more detailed description 
can be found in Appendix 3. 
The  evolution  of  electricity  generation  in  El  Salvador 
between  2000  and  2018  is  shown  in  Figure  11.  Since 
the 1990s, the Salvadoran electricity sector has relied 
most  heavily  on  thermal  power  generation,  followed 
by  hydropower  and  geothermal  energy.  Geothermal 
generation reached over 1 500 gigawatt hours (GWh) 
in 2008 and has since stagnated. Solar PV generation 
reached 309 GWh in 2018, while bioenergy generation 
exceeded 700 GWh. That same year, the share of non-
renewable energy generation reached one of its lowest 
values in the last decade, at 1 200 GWh (IRENA, 2020a).
Figure  10  shows  the  evolution  of  final  electricity 
demand from 1997 to 2018. In order to cover the average 
annual growth rate in demand, which is between 2% 
and  3%,  installed  power  capacity  has  increased.  The 
difference  between  the  installed  capacity  shown 
1  The five biomass power plants are not available all year long (SIGET, 2019). They are mostly available during the May to October harvesting period.

Figure 12.  Net electricity supply by resource,  
In recent years, there has been a decrease in domestic 
electricity generation, mainly due to growing electricity 
imports, most of which come from Guatemala. Figure 11 
reflects a clear reduction in domestic generation since 
2014,  with  total  net  electricity  generation  standing  at 
5 426 GWh in 2018.

Transmission system
The Salvadoran electricity transmission system relies 
on 230 kilovolt (kV) central lines that also serve the 
interconnection  with  Guatemala  and  Honduras,  as 
part of the Central American Electrical Interconnection 
System (SIEPAC – Sistema de Interconexión Eléctrica 
de  los  Países  de  América  Central).  This  system’s 
regional transmission line (RTL) has a transfer capacity 
at all borders in the region of 300 MW in one circuit.
The Salvadorian power market also includes generation 
and  distribution  companies;  a  transmission  system 
owner  –  the  Transmission  Company  of  El  Salvador 
(ETESAL  –  Empresa  Transmisora  de  El  Salvador); 
a  market  and  system  operator  in  charge  of  power 
exchanges (the UT); electricity suppliers and traders. 
All these actors are subject to electricity regulation at 
the national and MER levels. 
The central lines are complemented by 1 372 km long 
transmission  lines,  consisting  of  40  lines  at  115  kV 
(1 072  km)  and  four  interconnection  lines  at  230  kV 
(299  km).  The  UT  manages  the  country’s  electricity 
market  and  is  responsible  for  the  operation  of  the 
transmission system (SIGET, 2019).

are  subscribed  to  by  the  distribution  companies, 
via  a  competitive  bidding  process.  This  takes  place 
under the supervision of the regulatory entity, SIGET. 
The  MRS,  meanwhile,  operates  on  a  production-cost 
basis  and  allows  commercialisation  of  energy  at 
variable  prices,  with  these  depending  on  the  sector 
specifics. Factors here may include national demand, 
unavailability  rates,  and  maximum  powers  for  each 
plant, among others (CNE-PROESA, 2016).

The  Transmission  System  and  Wholesale  Electricity 
Market Operation based on Production Cost Regulation 
(ROBCP  –  Reglamento  de  Operación  del  Sistema 
de  Transmisión  y  del  Mercado  Mayorista  basado  en 
Costos de Producción) is the regulatory regime for the 
El  Salvador  market.  Establishing  clear  rules,  ROBCP 
aims to provide investors with guaranteed profits and 
end-users with affordable rates, while also rewarding 
efficiency.  Variable  production  costs  are  the  basis 
for  each  generator’s  generation  dispatch,  meaning 
that  the  market  operator  also  has  responsibility  for 
conducting a mandatory cost audit for each generator, 
in order to verify their costs. (CNE-PROESA, 2016).
The  three  electricity  tariff  categories  are  segmented 
according to maximum demand. First, there are small-
scale users – those with demand under 10 kW – while 
second,  there  are  medium-scale  users,  which  have 
demand  ranging  from  10  kW  to  50  kW.  Finally,  large-
scale  users  are  considered  to  be  those  with  demand 
exceeding 50 kW. For small-scale residential users that 
have consumed between 1 kWh and 105 kWh in the six 
months  prior  to  the  calculation  period,  a  continuous 
subsidy  is  provided  by  the  government  and  paid 
through the National Investment Fund for Electricity and 
Telephony (FINET – Fondo de Inversión en Electricidad 
y  Telefonía)  (Legislative  Assembly  Executive  Decree 
No. 38, 2018 – Asamblea Legislativa de la República de 
El Salvador, Decree Executivo No. 38, 2018).
The  electricity  market  comprises  of  two  main 
business areas: the Long-Term Contract market (CLP 
–  Contratos  de  Largo  Plazo),  and  the  spot  market 
25
Energy sector institutions and governance
developing  and 
implementing  subsidies  for  the 
energy  system  and  monitoring  the  good  use  of  the 
energy resources, as well as energy access across the 
Salvadorian population (IDB, 2013).
El  Salvador’s  institutional  landscape  in  the  energy 
sector  is  evolving,  after  going  through  a  series  of 
restructuring processes, focusing mainly on the power 
sector.
Additionally,  the  CNE  has  a  consultative  council, 
which  includes:  representatives  of  private  sector 
trade  associations  (industrial  and  commercial); 
representatives  of  professional  associations  linked 
to energy; representatives of academic and research 
institutions; representatives of organisations linked to 
consumer protection; representatives of organisations 
linked  to  protection  of  the  environment;  and 
representatives of electrical industry unions.
Key institutions
The  CNE  was  created  by  a  2007  legislative  decree 
and  established  as  the  energy  sector’s  governing 
authority.  It  is  responsible  for  developing  national 
energy strategy and policy in order to further promote 
the development of renewable energy, the rational use 
of energy, the integration of regional energy markets, 
and the creation of enabling regulatory frameworks.
As previously mentioned, the regulatory authority in 
the hydrocarbon sector is MINEC, operating through 
the  Regulatory  Directorate  of  Hydrocarbons  and 
Mines.  Infrastructure  and  handling  of  transportation 
of  hydrocarbons  are  also  overseen  by  MINEC.  The 
participation  of  private  companies  in  the  marketing 
and  importing  of  oil  by-products  is  allowed.  The 
regulator  fixes  liquified  petroleum  gas  (LPG)  prices 
and  establishes  a  reference  price  for  all  petroleum 
derivative  products.  The  Superintendence  of 
Competition (SC) oversees monitoring of the markets 
in order to promote and protect competition, increase 
economic efficiency and consumer welfare.
Before the creation of the CNE, the Ministry of Economy 
(MINEC  –  Ministerio  de  Economía)  was  in  charge  of 
the  sector  and  operated  through  two  directorates 
for  its  management  and  co-ordination.  These  were: 
the  directorate  for  electricity  and  the  regulatory 
directorate for hydrocarbons and mines. The latter still 
exists as part of MINEC, but as the regulatory entity 
for the oil and gas sector only (MINEC, n.d.).
The  main  functions  of  the  CNE  highlighted  in  the 
legislative decree are (IDB, 2013):
•  planning and design of the national energy policy
•  promotion  of  regulatory  frameworks  for  the 
creation of investment and competitive conditions 
in the energy sector
Recently,  the  government  of  El  Salvador  created 
several executive bodies, or cabinets, for institutional 
co-ordination  and  strategic  planning  in  key  policy 
areas  (Legislative  Assembly  Executive  Decree  No. 
14,  2019  –  Asamblea  Legislativa  de  la  República  de 
El Salvador, Decreto Ejecutivo No. 14, 2019). 
•  promotion of an adequate use of energy
•  promotion of the development and deployment of 
renewable energy resources
•  promotion  of  the  integration  of  regional  energy 
Amongst  these,  the  Energy  Cabinet  was  created  to 
undertake the strategic planning of investments in the 
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, as 
well as to conduct a review of the country’s energy mix. 
This is to be done in order to achieve affordable, cheaper 
energy  from  renewable  resources  for  the  population. 
The  Energy  Cabinet  is  composed  by  the  Presidential 
Commissioner for Operations and Government Cabinet, 
MINEC, CNE, CEL, SIGET and the DC.
markets.
The  CNE  has  a  board  of  directors  made  up  of 
representatives  from  its  five  member  institutions: 
MINEC,  which  acts  as  president  of  the  board;  the 
Minister of Finance (MH – Ministerio de Hacienda); the 
Minister  of  the  Environment  and  Natural  Resources 
(MARN  –  Ministerio  de  Medio  Ambiente  y  Recursos 
Naturales); the Minister of Public Works and Transport 
(MOP – Ministerio de Obras Públicas y de Transporte); 
the  Deputy  Minister  of  Transportation;  and  the 
President  of  Consumer  Advocacy  (DC  –  Defensoría 
del Consumidor). 
Structure of the power sector
Until  the  1990s,  El  Salvador  maintained  a  vertically 
integrated  structure  in  its  power  sector,  with  CEL 
as  the  country’s  only  state-owned  generator.  With 
Legislative  Decree  No.  137,  dated  October  18,  1948, 
CEL was established as an independent, public electric 
utility in charge of developing, conserving, managing 
and using the energy resources of the country (SIGET, 
2017a). 
The board of directors has responsibility for: monitoring 
the implementation of policy and strategies contained 
in  national  energy  plans;  promoting  the  approval 
of  laws  and  regulations  of  the  energy  sector  at  a 
national level; preparing the national energy balance; 
26
Before  the  approval  of  the  General  Electricity  Law 
and  in  preparation  for  reform,  Legislative  Decree 
No.  808,  dated  September  1996,  established  SIGET 
as  the  regulatory  institution  for  the  electricity  and 
telecommunications  sector.  As  the  regulator,  SIGET 
has the task of applying and enforcing the country’s 
legal  framework  concerning  both  the  electricity  and 
telecommunications  sectors.  SIGET  also  guarantees 
both user and operator rights, while acting to develop 
a  competitive  market  and  more 
investment  by 
establishing a robust legal framework. Final consumer 
tariffs are regulated by SIGET, while FINET is in charge 
of  administration  and  the  allocation  of  subsidies 
to  low-income  users,  as  well  as  the  expansion  of 
electricity coverage and rural electrification.
sector  participation,  and  by  2018,  there  were  25 
private sector electricity generation plants operating 
in the wholesale market (UN ECLAC, 2020).
The law also maintained CEL’s presence in the generation 
sector  and,  over  time,  CEL  subsidiary  generation 
companies  were  created.  These  include  LaGeo  in 
the  geothermal  sector,  the  Cucumacayán  Electricity 
Company (CECSA – Compañía Eléctrica Cucumacayán) 
in the hydropower sector and Energy Investments (INE – 
Inversiones Energéticas) in the thermal sector. 
Ownership  and  maintenance  of  the  transmission 
system was turned over to the company ETESAL, while 
UT, a private corporation, was assigned to operate the 
transmission system and national electricity market. 
Following the enactment of the General Electricity Law 
and  Legislative  Decree  843,  dated  10  October,1996, 
El  Salvador  began  liberalising  its  electricity  market 
and unbundling the vertically integrated CEL. The law 
opened up both generation and distribution to private

Energy policies and regulatory framework
For  geothermal  and  hydropower  projects  under 
5 MW, there is a more streamlined concession process 
involving directly awarded tenders that are regulated 
by SIGET. 
El  Salvador’s  National  Energy  Policy  2020-2050 
was still being developed by CNE at the time of this 
report’s release, with a publishing date of later in 2020. 
At time of writing, the existing national energy policy 
was thus still the one published by the Council in 2010 
(CNE,  2010).  This  had  the  purpose  of  serving  as  a 
strategic  guide  for  the  development  of  the  national 
energy sector during the 2010-2024 period. 
SIGET  issues  an  agreement  for  an  approved  project, 
which can be granted in concessions of geothermal and 
hydro resources for power generation purposes. The 
project developers must also present the agreement 
for processing by the Legislative Assembly, which has 
to grant concessions for the use of the corresponding 
natural resources.
The 2010-2024 policy includes:
• 
renewable energy resource promotion and energy 
mix diversification 
Rules for electricity trading activities
•  protection  of  final  users  with  a  strengthening  of 
The retail electricity market is governed by a regulatory 
framework  that  promotes  the  commercialisation  of 
electricity. The regulations allow for a wide diversity of 
electricity suppliers. This allows for more competitive 
options at the retail level, so that end-users are able 
to choose their electric power supplier. This regulation 
stipulates  that  an  electricity  market  participant,  or 
marketer, can:

The primary entity for implementing this energy policy 
is the CEL and its subsidiary companies. These assume a 
strategic role in energy research, project execution and 
renewable  energy  generation,  as  well  as  maintaining 
a  high  degree  of  co-ordination  with  the  CNE  in  the 
development of El Salvador’s energy sector. 
transmission, and distribution 
•  purchase  and  sell  electric  power  in  low  voltage 
networks
•  purchase and sell electric power in the wholesale 
market. 
Regarding  the  first  of  these  points,  the  prices  and 
conditions of the supply contracts may be the same, 
or they may differ from those contained in the tariffs 
approved  by  SIGET  for  distributors  that  operate  as 
marketers  in  the  areas  where  their  networks  are 
located (SIGET, 2017b).
The government has also developed various actions for 
the development of renewable energy in the country 
and for the fostering of private sector participation. 
These include the development of fiscal incentives for 
renewable energy project development proposed by 
MINEC  and  approved  by  the  Salvadoran  Legislative 
Assembly  (Legislative  Assembly  Executive  Decree 
No. 462, 2007 – Asamblea Legislativa de la República 
de El Salvador, Decreto Ejecutivo No. 462, 2007). The 
CNE  has  been  developing  standards  for  renewable 
energy PPAs (CNE-PROESA, 2016), net-metering, and 
priority  dispatch  in  the  wholesale  market  for  non-
conventional  renewable  energy  generators  (wind, 
solar and biomass plants), among others. 
This  regulation  also  allows  for  the  connection  of  small 
power plants directly to the distribution system, enabling 
transactions  between  generators  and  distributors, 
distributors and marketers, and distributors and end users.
Legal Stability Law for Investment
In order to attract and promote investment, El Salvador 
enacted  the  Legal  Stability  Law  for  Investments  in 
2014. This provides a framework for guaranteeing legal 
assurance to the investor, through the implementation 
of  legal  stability  contracts  (Legislative  Assembly 
Executive Decree No. 905, 2015 – Asamblea Legislativa 
de la República de El Salvador, Decreto Ejecutivo No. 
905,  2015).  This  law  can  be  applied  to  national  or 
foreign investors that are developing new projects, or 
expanding  existing  projects,  within  strategic  sectors 
of El Salvador, including the energy sector. 
The General Electricity Law 
In addition to serving as the basis for the liberalisation 
of El Salvador’s energy sector, the General Electricity 
Law  establishes  that  auctions  are  the  preferred 
mechanism  for  procuring  new  power  capacity  and 
allocating concessions for projects using geothermal 
and hydropower. 
28
Investors covered under this law are ensured stability 
of taxation and capital repatriation conditions, among 
other benefits. Under the law, developers must commit 
to undertake development work in the territory of the 
municipality where their project is located. This work 
must  be  worth  at  least  3%  of  the  total  contracted 
investment. There is also a time limit of two years from 
the start of the project’s operation for disbursing the 
development work funds. 
Distributed generation regulation
In  2013,  with  Agreement  No.  120-E-2013,  SIGET 
approved a new norm, known as Open Procurement 
Processes  for  Long-term  Contracts  Supported  by 
Renewable  Distributed  Generation.  This  enables  the 
development  of  renewable  distributed  generation 
auctions of up to 20 MW. Under this, the procurement 
process  is  led  by  a  distribution  company,  willing 
to  purchase  power  from  a  self-generator  for  the 
distribution grid.
Despite  the  benefits  of  the  law,  however,  several 
developers  have  experienced  delays 
in  project 
implementation due to its execution. Nonetheless, in 
2019,  MINEC  signed  the  first  legal  stability  contract 
for 
the  government  of 
El Salvador and the company Ventus S.A de C.V, which 
is  developing  the  Ventus  Wind  Farm  in  Metapán,  in 
the province of Santa Ana.
In  2017,  through  Agreement  No.  367-E-2017,  SIGET 
approved  the  Norm  for  End  User  Producers  of 
Electrical  Energy  with  Renewable  Energy  Sources. 
This  established  the  procedures,  requirements  and 
responsibilities applicable to the connection, operation, 
control and commercialisation of surplus energy from 
distributed  renewable  generation  units.  In  addition, 
this  regulation  also  governs  relations  between  the 
generator of electricity for self-consumption and the 
distribution company that is to receive the injections 
of surplus power. 
investments,  between 
Fiscal Incentives Act to promote renewable 
energy
This  Act  for  the  promotion  of  renewable  energy 
describes the benefits intended for investment in the 
construction or expansion of renewable energy power 
plants.  The  technologies  covered  by  the  Act  include 
biomass,  geothermal  energy,  hydropower,  solar  PV 
and wind. 
This  procedure  for  selling  electricity  to  the  grid  is 
usually referred to as “net metering”. With this scheme, 
end  users  (generally  residential  and  commercial 
customers)  which  generate  their  own  electricity  can 
feed  excess  generation  back  into  the  grid.  This  end 
user producer is then compensated in terms of energy 
(i.e., credit in kWh), and the credit can be applied to 
offset  consumption  of  electricity  within  the  current 
billing period (e.g., one month).
According  to  the  law,  investments  in  new  projects 
shall  enjoy  the  following  benefits  and  tax  incentives 
(Legislative  Assembly  Executive  Decree  No.  462, 
2007  –  Asamblea  Legislativa  de  la  República  de 
El Salvador, Decreto Ejecutivo No. 462, 2007):
International power trade 
•  For  the  first  ten  years  of  the  project’s  lifetime, 
imported  power  generation  equipment  is  duty 
free.  
Today’s regional transmission line – known as SIEPAC 
(Figure  16)  –  links  six  different  countries  and  evolved 
from  a  series  of  bilateral  arrangements  between 
regional  countries.  In  those  early  stages,  energy 
transfers  were  limited  to  amounts  varying  between 
5 MW and 50 MW and took place according to specific 
arrangements. 
•  For the first five years of the project’s life time, if 
the project is larger than 10 MW, and for ten years, 
if it is less than 10 MW, the project is exempt from 
income tax. 
•  Any  sales  made  under  Certified  Emission 
the  Clean 
(CERs,  made  under 
Reductions 
Development  Mechanism),  or  via  similar  carbon 
offsetting  markets,  gain  a  complete  exemption 
from tax.
Such  transfers  enjoyed  considerable  political  support 
amongst Central American countries, which led to the 
1996 Marco Treaty of the Electricity Market of Central 
America, which came into force in 1999. This was the 
foundation stone for MER, which uses the infrastructure 
established by SIEPAC. At time of writing, in addition to 
El Salvador, MER’s members are Costa Rica, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. 
•  Value Added Tax (VAT) is waived if it is otherwise 
liable  as  part  of  efforts  made  for  investment  or 
pre-investment in power plant construction.

The Marco Treaty
The  SIEPAC  interconnection  established  by  the  Marco 
Treaty  of  the  Electricity  Market  of  Central  America  is 
owned  by  the  EPR,  which  the  Treaty  also  established, 
along with the regional regulator, the CRIE, and a regional 
market operator, the EOR (Reinstein et al., 2011).2
CRIE is based in Guatemala and began work in 2000, 
led  by  its  board  of  commissioners  and  executive 
secretary.  The  board  contains  a  representative  from 
each  member-state,  with  this  representative  usually 
also a member of their country’s national regulatory 
board.
Given  the  increasing  volume  of  electricity  imports 
from  the  region,  El  Salvador’s  national  electricity 
market  has  become  highly  dynamic.  As  of  2017,  the 
country had 47 authorised agents for transactions in 
MER: eight generators, seven distributors, 31 marketers 
and  one  large  user  (CRIE,  2018).  The  majority  of

with  each  other  in  three  ways:  spot  transactions, 
firm,  or  non-firm  contracts.  (Reinstein  et  al.,  2011).

2  Transmission rights (DTs – Derechos de transmission), is a system of trading the rights to using transmission lines.
3  The transmission entity (EOR in this case) will issue rights to use the regional line (SIEPAC) and make it available to buyers and sellers of electricity in the region. The regional energy  
  buyer/seller will then buy these transmission rights in order to use the line to transmit/transport the energy across the region for their needs.
4  The regional transmission line is often constrained, and transmission entities are required to plan ahead of time to manage the system. The transmission rights system allows them to plan  
and offer a transparent pricing system for the users.

and  provisions 
in 
In  November  2018,  CRIE  published  RESOLUTION-
CRIE-95-2018,  which  establishes 
the  minimum 
technical requirements for connecting and operating 
solar PV and wind plants in the regional power system. 
Since  El  Salvador  has  the  opportunity  to  use  the 
SIEPAC  infrastructure  to  meet  national  electricity 
demand,  opportunities  exist  that  can  create  a 
more  robust  national  transmission  system.  One 
such  opportunity  is  the  construction  of  additional 
230 kV lines between the Port of Acajutla, El Pedregal 
and  the  15  de  Septiembre  substations,  which,  when 
complemented by the 230 kV line to be built by Pacific 
Energy (EDP – Energía del Pacifico) between Acajutla 
and  Ahuachapán  (see  Figure  13),  would  form  a  ring 
loop  and  therefore  create  a  more  robust  network 
(CRIE, 2018). 
This  resolution  will  be  applicable  to  new  requests 
for  integrating  these  renewable  technologies  into 
the  regional  grid.  (CRIE,  2018)  The  resolution  and 
the  minimum  technical  requirements  have  been 
transferred by the Executive Secretary of the CRIE to 
national  regulatory  bodies  in  the  region,  to  evaluate 
the  possibility  of  including  them  in  their  national 
regulations,  in  the  short  term.  Consultation  and 
training activities are therefore also envisaged by the 
national regulators of the participating member states, 
as well as solar PV and wind project developers. 
On the other hand, the construction of a transmission 
line between Acajutla and Ahuachapán is also tied to 
the  construction  of  a  natural  gas  power  plant  in  the 
Sonsonate region.
The resolution further stipulates that system operators 
and market operators adopt the necessary measures to 
co ordinate the operation of the distributed generation 
of wind and solar PV power plants connected at low 
or medium voltage levels, or storage of energy at the 
distribution level (CRIE, 2018).
Such  considerations  are 
in  ETESAL’s 
transmission  network  expansion  plan.  This  type 
of  network  would  also  facilitate  the  dispatch  of

Box 1.  The Clean Energy Corridor of Central America
IRENA launched the Clean Energy Corridor of Central America (CECCA) initiative in 2015. This was in order 
to support the accelerated deployment of renewables at the regional level. It was also undertaken within 
the context of the SIEPAC line that interconnects Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua 
and Panama, and to promote cross-border trade of renewable energy power in the region. 
CECCA  is  built  around  the  key  pillars  of  implementation:  power  system  operations  and  regulatory 
frameworks  for  increasing  VRE  shares;  country  and  regional  power  system  planning  with  renewables; 
zoning and renewable resource assessment; and capacity building and information dissemination. 
The implementation of CECCA started within its pilot country, Panama, in 2016. There, an assessment was 
made of PPAs for solar and wind energy, as part of the regulatory component of the initiative. Likewise, 
IRENA has conducted a series of capacity building activities for Central American national and regional 
grid operators, targeting the integration of VRE into their electricity systems, in line with CECCA’s technical 
component.
Additionally,  IRENA  has  recently  started  the  regional  Renewable  Roadmap  (REmap)  and  flexibility 
assessment of the power systems of all the CECCA countries – an effort that forms part of the country 
and regional power system planning pillar of the initiative. It is envisaged that this pillar will be expanded 
by implementing a series of workshops. These will be on long-term energy planning, the promotion and 
identification of best planning practices, and experience sharing among the countries of Central America 
when planning with renewable energy sources.
 
Regional partners have supported CECCA in its development, with the initiative becoming a milestone and 
reference point for the Central American region. It has also now been included as part of other regional 
efforts, as it forms the basis for the Central American Economic Commission for Latin America and the 
Caribbean (ECLAC)-Central American Integration System (SICA) energy strategy 2030.

3.  Renewable energy
  developments 
Drivers of renewable energy deployment
Addressing  these  challenges  has  become  the  main 
driver  for  the  promotion  of  renewable  energy  in 
El  Salvador.  With  the  introduction  of  the  National 
Energy Policy 2010-2024, the country prioritised the 
diversification  of  the  energy  mix,  as  a  starting  point 
for  improving  the  energy  supply.  This  was  also  seen 
as a tool for increasing access to electricity across the 
population. 
The  Republic  of  El  Salvador  is  making  a  concerted 
effort to boost economic growth and the welfare of its 
inhabitants. In this regard, the government considers 
the  energy  sector  a  strong  contributor  to  economic 
and  social  development  (CNE,  2010).  Recent  IRENA 
work, for example, estimates that more than 2 million 
jobs  have  been  created  by  the  renewable  energy 
sector  in  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  by  2017. 
Potentially, this could reach more than 3 million jobs 
by 2030, given a scenario in which the rise in global 
temperatures is kept to well below 2°C and closer to 
1.5°C, during this century (IRENA, 2020b). 
With the adoption of the Paris agreement, El Salvador 
has also prioritised the mitigation of greenhouse gas 
emissions from the energy sector. This is to be achieved 
by increasing the penetration of clean energy sources, 
together with improving energy efficiency along the 
whole energy chain.
On a global level, renewable energy has experienced 
a rapid decline in cost in recent years. Between 2010 
and  2019,  the  global  weighted  average  levelised 
cost  of  electricity  (LCOE)  from  solar  PV  fell  82%,  to 
USD  68.40  per  megawatt  hour  (MWh),  while  the 
cost  of  electricity  from  onshore  wind  declined  45%, 
to  USD  52.8/MWh  (IRENA,  2020b).  El  Salvador’s 
power generation costs, however, have been strongly 
influenced by the price volatility of oil and gas, due to 
fossil fuel dependency in the country’s energy sector. 
The cost of this energy has put pressure on the state 
budget  and  has  a  negative  impact  on  its  final  users 
(see Box 2).
With good progress made on energy access rates and 
renewable energy penetration in the power sector, the 
new, National Energy Policy 2020-2050 is now under 
development.  This  draws  up  a  long-term  energy 
strategy for the country, highlighting the importance 
of  mitigating  the  dependency  on  fossil-fuels  and 
climate change effects, with the promotion and use of 
renewable energy beyond the power sector. 
The  new  energy  policy  supports  the  development 
of  direct  use  applications  from  renewable  energy 
sources,  such  as  geothermal  and  solar  thermal, 
facilitating  the  penetration  of  clean  technologies  in 
the industrial and agricultural sector. This is the result 
of  the  successful  implementation  in  recent  years  of 
renewable  energy  pilot  projects,  involving  local  and 
vulnerable  communities.  These  have  provided  clear 
benefits  by  boosting  local  economies,  promoting 
the development of the agri-food sector, and by the 
inclusion of women in commercial activities. 
In  addition,  El  Salvador  is  vulnerable  to  climate 
change,  with  temperatures  forecast  to  rise  between 
1.4°C  and  2°C  by  2050.  During  this  period,  sea 
levels  may  rise  by  some  18  centimetres  (cm),  while 
‘extreme  weather  events’,  such  as  tropical  storms, 
floods  and  droughts,  are  also  expected  to  increase 
in  frequency  and  intensity  (USAID,  2017).  All  these 
conditions will affect different aspects of the country, 
including energy infrastructure and power generation. 
Hydropower generation along the Lempa River Basin, 
for example, could decline by between 33% and 53% 
by the end of the century (USAID, 2017). 
Additionally, El Salvador envisages the use of innovative 
technologies such as electric vehicles, blockchain and 
digitalisation. This is with the aim of creating a modern 
energy sector, as a priority on the path to achieving 
the country’s sustainable development objectives and 
attracting foreign investment to boost the economy.
33
Box 2.  Electricity tariffs
During the 1990s, the country’s power generation portfolio witnessed an influx of conventional thermal 
units, which led to a higher fossil-fuel dependency. This was despite the traditionally significant role of 
hydro and geothermal power generation in the energy system.
During the following decades, global oil market price volatility provoked an increase in electricity tariffs, 
giving El Salvador one of the highest residential rates in Central America (see Figure 18). Between 1998 
and 2015, the average electricity tariff in El Salvador increased by 53.5%, due to the rise in international 
oil prices. Generation costs (including fuel and transmission costs) corresponds to an estimated 80% of 
the final electricity price, while the remaining 20% is mostly distribution and commercialisation charges. 
The  latter  decreased  dramatically  in  2015,  however,  due  to  the  entrance  of  new  actors  in  the  country’s 
distribution market (Superintendence of Competition of El Salvador, 2017).
The government of El Salvador believes that renewable energy sources are the key to mitigating dependency 
on fossil-fuels in power generation, with their use also contributing to a reduction in electricity tariffs (CNE, 
2010). Additionally, the current high costs of electricity require the use of subsidies to provide services to all 
the inhabitants, resulting in high expenditure for the country. Therefore, among the main objectives of the new 
National Energy Policy 2020-2050 is a reduction of the electricity tariff through the promotion of renewable 
energy generation, facilitating the removal of electricity subsidies towards the end of the policy period.

Renewable energy resources 
Geothermal energy
The exploitation of geothermal resources in El Salvador 
started back in the 1960s with the identification of 18 
potential  geothermal  sites  in  the  country.  The  first 
geothermal power plant was commissioned in 1975 in 
Ahuachapán. 
The range of renewable energy resources available in 
the  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  regions  is  a  wide 
one  –  although  much  of  this  potential  has  yet  to  be 
realised. While more than a quarter of the total primary 
energy supply in the region came from renewables in 
2017  –  twice  the  global  average  –  the  regions’  total 
renewable generation represents just 6% of its overall 
renewable power potential. 
This  relatively  long  history  in  the  sector  has  given 
El  Salvador  a 
leading  role  within  the  regional 
geothermal sector. There are now significant numbers 
of experienced scientists and technicians available in 
the  country,  with  these  often  sharing  their  expertise 
via the Geothermal Centre of Excellence in El Salvador 
(Box  3).  This  provides  young  professionals  from  the 
country and around Latin America and the Caribbean 
with training courses and workshops in many aspects 
of geothermal energy. 
A  renewable  energy  installed  capacity  of  50  GW  of 
bioenergy, 186 GW of hydro, 108 GW of solar PV and 
93  GW  of  wind  is  achievable  by  2030,  and  in  line 
with  the  Paris  Agreement  (IRENA,  2020b).  These 
estimations do not consider the geothermal or ocean 
energy  resource  potential,  which  will  also  play  an 
important future role in the region’s energy supply.
Nowadays,  utility  company  LaGeo  operates  roughly 
200  MW  of  geothermal  power  capacity  across  two 
geothermal fields. Following a public tender in 2001, 
Enel  Green  Power  purchased  a  9%  share  of  LaGeo, 
gradually increasing this to 36%, with the government 
of El Salvador holding the remaining shares. In 2008, 
the  government  obtained  full  ownership  of  LaGeo, 
after  Enel  Green  Power  sold  its  ownership  share 
(Sanyal et al., 2016).
El  Salvador  is  not  an  exception  to  these  regional 
characteristics.  Given  its  geographical  position,  the 
country’s  renewable  energy  potential  is  abundant 
and  diverse,  and  includes  bioenergy,  geothermal, 
hydropower, ocean, solar and wind. While the country 
has recently made significant advances in diversifying 
its  energy  supply,  much  of  its  renewable  resource 
potential remains untapped. 
Bioenergy
Regarding  direct  use  of  geothermal  energy,  an 
installed capacity of 3.36 MWt is estimated for 2015, 
including a variety of applications for swimming and 
bathing,  as  well  as  pilot  projects  in  the  agri-food 
sector, such as greenhouse heating, fish farming and 
food drying (Lund and Boyd, 2015).
In  terms  of 
installed  power  capacity,  by  2019, 
El  Salvador’s  solid  biomass  had  reached  298  MW 
while  biogas  totalled  nearly  7  MW  (IRENA,  2020a). 
The estimated net primary production of bioenergy in 
El Salvador is around 10.5 tonnes of carbon per hectare 
per  year  (tC/ha/yr),  which  is  well  above  the  global 
average of between 3 tC/ha/yr and 4 tC/ha/yr (IRENA, 
2019).  In  2018,  bioenergy  (sugarcane  bagasse  and 
firewood) stood at over 18% of primary energy supply. 
A  range  of  factors  govern  the  quantity  of  residues 
available  to  the  bioeneregy  sector,  including  the 
overall  level  of  activity  in  the  economy.  This  is  also 
largely the case for solid waste from urban areas and 
sawmill residues, which are beyond the scope of this 
report. 
35
Box 3.  The Geothermal Centre of Excellence in El Salvador
Blessed with extensive geothermal resources, El Salvador is fortunate in having a history of geothermal energy 
development that now dates back to the 1950s. This has given it an unprecedented level of expertise in the field 
within the region – a factor now capitalised upon by the Geothermal Centre of Excellence in El Salvador.
A joint project between LaGeo and the GRÓ GTP Geothermal Training Programme from Iceland (previously 
known  as  the  United  Nations  University-Geothermal  Training  Programme),  the  Centre  has  established  the 
country as a leading location for training in the geothermal industry.
Young professionals from El Salvador, other Latin American countries and the Caribbean have been able to 
share the extensive technical, scientific and managerial experience and knowledge accumulated by the Centre 
via a range of workshops and courses. 
The five-month Geothermal Diploma Course for Latin America is a flagship amongst these, helping El Salvador 
set the standard for geothermal training in the region. The Diploma brings together experts from El Salvador 
and Iceland – another key country in the global geothermal industry – thanks to a co-operation agreement 
between LaGeo and GRÓ GTP. 
The Centre has so far provided the Diploma course – and other, shorter training programmes –to over 700 
professionals. In addition to those from El Salvador who have enrolled on these courses, students have included 
professionals  from  Montserrat,  Saint  Kitts  &  Nevis,  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  in  the  Caribbean,  and 
Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, 
Panama, and Peru from elsewhere in Latin America.

Hydropower
Solar energy
Figure 19 presents an overview of the solar irradiation 
for El Salvador, according to the IRENA Global Atlas. 
The  solar  irradiation  in  the  country  is  uniformly 
consistent  across  the  territory,  being  in  average 
larger  than  2 000 kWh/m2.  Likewise,  more  than  80% 
of  the  Salvadorian  territory  shows  estimated  annual 
generation  per  unit  of  installed  PV  capacity  in  the 
range  of  1 600  kilowatt  hours  per  kilowatt  peak  per 
year (kWh/kWp/yr) and 1 800 kWh/kWp/yr (IRENA, 
2019).
Hydropower  continues  to  have  the  largest  share  of 
renewables in El Salvador’s electricity mix. 
In  recent  years,  CEL  has  carried  out  an  80  MW 
expansion project at the 5 de Noviembre hydroelectric 
plant, with 2 January 2017 seeing the plant’s two new, 
40 MW generating units begin commercial operation. 
This  allows  them  to  harness  the  surplus  water  that 
accompanies  the  rainy  season.  Meanwhile,  the 
El Chaparral hydroelectric plant is under construction 
and  will  have  an  installed  generation  capacity  of 
65.7  MW  on  completion.  It  is  expected  to  start 
operations in 2021.
Several solar PV projects have become operational in 
recent years, totalling over 166 megawatt peak (MWp) 
of installed power capacity, by 2018. Solar irradiation 
in  El  Salvador  is  high,  which  provides  excellent 
yields and favourable cost-benefit conditions for the 
development of solar PV plants. 
Ocean energy
Preliminary  research  on  Mizata  beach  (La  Libertad 
Department)  has  been  carried  out  to  determine  the 
energy  potential  of  marine  waves.  (LaGeo,  n.d.). 
LaGeo’s renewable energy unit, the entity conducting 
the  study,  collected  the  necessary  data  using  a 
sensor that measured: (i) height, speed, temperature, 
direction  and  flow  of  the  energy  contained  in  one 
metre of wave front;  and (ii) the height variation of 
the tides.

Wind energy
Box 4.  IRENA Global Atlas Geospatial  
and Site assessment services
 
Despite  the  country’s  interest  in  promoting  wind 
power  plants,  the  prices  achieved  in  El  Salvador’s 
first  auction  in  2014  were  over  the  ceiling  prices,  so 
no wind projects were awarded. During the country’s 
second  auction,  one  project  was  awarded,  but  as  of 
2019, it has not come online. 
Resource mapping is the first phase in planning 
a  cost-effective  renewable  energy  project  for 
subsequent development. 
IRENA’s  geospatial  assessment  services  aim 
to  identify  areas  and  zones  (and  attributes)  in 
a  country  that  are  appropriate  for  deploying 
utility-scale  wind  and  solar  PV  power  projects. 
The  methodology  combines  resource  maps 
and  ancillary  data,  such  as  transmission  lines 
and road networks, protected areas, land cover, 
topography,  and  population  growth.  These 
factors  are  assessed  in  order  to  identify  areas 
and  zones  that  have  good  resource  availability, 
are within reasonable proximity to the necessary 
infrastructure,  and  have 
low  environmental 
and  social  impact,  based  on  local  conditions. 
Furthermore,  the  assessment  calculates  the 
maximum  installable  capacity,  identifies  the 
energy  generation  potential  and  suggests 
possible  storage  opportunities  for  each  zone. 
Such information supports adequate generation 
and  transmission  expansion  planning,  reduces 
the risk of investing in unsuitable areas, supports 
countries in making strategic decisions on energy 
security,  and  increases  the  share  of  sustainable 
sources of electricity generation. 
looking  at  measurements  from 
Several  studies 
stations  have  detected  wind 
meteorological 
speeds  of  between  1.1  metres  per  second  (m/s)  and 
4.3 m/s (MARN and UCA, 2005). Figure 20 presents 
an overview of the average wind speed at 100 m hub 
height, showing that this averages between 4 m/s and
5 m/s. Likewise, around 70% of Salvadorian territory 
has  a  potential  wind  power  density  (at  100  m  high) 
of below 260 watts per square metre (W/m2) (IRENA, 
2019).  Few  areas  have  shown  high  and  relatively 
constant  wind  speeds.  One  site  that  has  proved  to 
have high wind speeds is the 54 MW project developed 
by Ventus in Metapán, which has an average speed of 
6.6 m/s at 50 metres high
Renewable energy master plan  
In 2012, in collaboration with the Japan International 
Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  CNE  developed  the 
Master  Plan  for  the  Renewable  Energy  Development 
of  El  Salvador.  This  plan  identifies  the  renewable 
energy sources that have potential in the country, and 
highlights an indicative roadmap for the development 
of those resources out to 2026. The estimated potential 
capacity additions by then, as per each energy source, 
are provided in Table 2.
IRENA’s site assessment service aims to evaluate 
the  technical  and  financial  viability  of  sites  for 
solar  PV  and  wind  project  development.  The 
methodology  uses  high  resolution  site-specific 
time series resource data, site characteristics and 
technological parameters to calculate the annual 
energy production (AEP) at different exceedance 
probabilities  for  each  site.  It  further  simulates 
the levelised costs and tariffs at which the sites 
would  become  viable  for  further  investment 
in 
in-situ  measurements  and  subsequent 
development. This information is of critical value 
to local authorities, which can screen these sites 
by comparing the pro-forma tariffs or levelised 
costs  to  a  benchmark,  ensuring  resources  are 
invested only in worthy locations.   
This master plan aims to promote the diversification 
of the energy mix, by adopting clean energy sources. 
The  development  of  this  plan  also  encouraged  the 
implementation  of  other  supporting  mechanisms 
for  renewable  energy,  such  as  auctions,  long  term 
contracts, and others.

Box 5.  IRENA Regional REmap & FlexTool
IRENA is currently developing a regional REmap (Renewable Energy Roadmap) study for Central America. This 
will include the countries of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Panama and 
be complemented by a power system flexibility assessment using IRENA’s FlexTool. This is a publicly and freely 
available tool that analyses power system flexibility in detail. 
The regional REmap study explores technology options that enable an energy transition at the regional level, 
through  the  accelerated  development  of  renewable  energy  in  the  energy  mix.  The  study  covers  electricity 
generation, the end-use sectors (transport, industry and buildings) and energy efficiency. Additionally, using 
the FlexTool, the energy scenarios resulting from the REmap analysis are analysed in terms of power system 
flexibility, in order to check their technical feasibility and provide feedback to the REmap team.
The project began in May 2019, with its first step a major effort to engage country counterparts and institutions 
and scope the vision for the analysis. This involved several conference calls, including with member countries 
and regional institutions, with the aim of securing their interest and participation in the project. As a culmination 
of this first step, IRENA organised the First Regional Workshop: A renewable energy roadmap and flexibility 
assessment for Central America, which was hosted by the National Energy Secretariat of Panama and took place 
in Panama City between 4-5 September 2019.
During  the  workshop,  the  countries  involved  in  the  study,  partner  institutions  and  IRENA  assessed  policy 
objectives and priorities at the national and regional levels, along with the status of the energy system in each 
country. The workshop also served to evaluate the current status of renewable energy development, existing 
planning models and the vision of regional integration. Regional institutions that joined the workshop included 
the Latin American Energy Organisation (OLADE – Organización Latinoamericana de Energía), ECLAC, World 
Bank, the Inter American Development Bank (IDB), UNFCCC, SICA, EPR and EOR.
As a follow-up to the first workshop, individual data requests were sent to each country and conference calls 
were organised to discuss the data input for the study. Having collected most of the data needed for the analysis, 
the project is currently at the phase of developing the energy system reference and REmap scenarios that will 
then serve as an input for the flexibility assessment. 
A 2nd workshop was scheduled for the last week of March 2020 to help in the development of the reference 
scenario. The workshop was confirmed with the participation of all countries and regional institutions, but had 
to be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The workshop will be replaced by bilateral calls with countries. 
The calls should take place during the second half of 2020, with the overall final results of the project expected 
to be concluded and presented by the end of that year.

Renewable energy support mechanisms 
in the power sector  
•  Priority  dispatch:  Article  67-E,  which  is  included 
among the reforms made to the General Electricity 
Law, establishes that renewable generation plants 
(from  solar,  wind  and  biomass)  have  dispatch 
priority,  and  therefore  their  marginal  cost  is 
considered  to  be  zero  (Legislative  Assembly 
Executive  Decree  No.  80,  2012  –  Asamblea 
Legislativa de la República de El Salvador, Decreto 
Ejecutivo No. 80, 2012).
El  Salvador  utilises  a  range  of  support  mechanisms 
to  incentivise  renewable  energy  development  in  the 
power sector. The main instruments, as shown in Table 
3,  can  be  segmented  into  the  following  categories: 
to  electricity 
a)  Fiscal 
transmission  grid; 
instruments; 
d) financial instruments; and e) others (IRENA, 2016).
incentives;  b)  access 
c) 
regulatory 
Regulatory instruments
Fiscal incentives 
•  Renewable  energy  auctions:  Technology-specific 
auctions  are  implemented  to  procure  renewable 
energy  capacity  resulting  in  long-term  power 
purchase agreements (PPA). 
•  Value  added  tax  (VAT,  13%):  Provisions  for  VAT 
exemption  related  to  pre-investment  work  and 
investments  in  the  construction  of  renewable 
energy  projects  (Legislative  Assembly  Executive 
Decree  No.  462,  2007  –  Asamblea  Legislativa  de 
la República de El Salvador, Decreto Ejecutivo No. 
462, 2007).
•  Distributed generation: Net metering regulations 
enable  eligible  self-producers  of 
renewable 
energy to inject surplus production into the local 
distribution  grid  (SIGET,  2017a).  Likewise,  there 
are rules set for renewable distributed generation 
auctions in the Agreement No. 120-E-2013.
Income  tax:  For  projects  larger  than  10  MW  in 
size, there is a five year income tax exemption. For 
those smaller, the exemption is for ten years. 
• 
Financial instruments
Import  tax  (5%):  Tax  benefits  for  the  import  of 
equipment,  services  or  products  intended  for 
renewable energy projects.
• 
•  Dedicated  fund:  A  public  fund  (FINET)  finances 
projects  related  to  energy  generation  or  the 
improvement  of  energy  infrastructure  in  rural 
areas.
•  Certificates of Reduced Emissions (CERs): Under 
the  framework  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol’s  Clean 
Development  Mechanism  –  and  other,  similar 
carbon markets – income derived from the sale of 
CERs is completely tax exempt.
•  Eligibility  fund:  A  public  fund  of  the  El  Salvador 
Development  Bank  (BANDESAL  –  Banco  de 
Desarrollo de El Salvador), provides financing for 
renewable projects. 
Access to electricity transmission grids
Others
•  Grid  access:  Generators  are  guaranteed  grid 
access, including renewable energy generators.
•  Social  support  requirements:  Renewable  energy 
projects  are  required  to  allocate  a  percentage 
of  their  revenue  to  either  directly  support  local 
community  projects,  or  to  support  the  overall 
financing  of  community  development.  (REN21, 
2017).

Renewable energy in rural access programs
Based on: BNEF (2012)
•  The  auctions  aim  to  be  transparent  and  are 
therefore  publicly  announced,  with  a  publicly 
disclosed process available to view on the website 
of  the  distribution  company  leading  the  auction 
process.
Renewable energy auctions
The  reform  of  the  General  Electricity  Law  in  2007 
established  the  procedures  and  regulations  for  the 
use of bidding processes to procure power capacity. 
Under these, the winning bidders enter into long-term 
PPAs with the off-taker, a distribution company. 
•  Based on the result of the power planning process, 
CNE  and  SIGET  agree  on  scheduling  the  tender 
process.  There  is  not,  however,  an  established 
schedule for the implementation of auctions in the 
long term.
There are two types of renewable energy auctions in 
El Salvador, for generators connected to the grid and 
for distributed generation projects.
Some  of  the  most  relevant  aspects  of  the  auction 
methodology in El Salvador are the following (USAID, 
2018):
•  The  auctions  are  technology  specific,  with  defined 
quotas  and  a  reallocation  mechanism.  If  the  target 
for  one  technology  has  not  been  met,  additional 
amounts of other technologies can be contracted to 
fill the gap.
•  The contracted amounts per auction are allocated 
proportionally  among  all  of  the  distribution 
companies, based on their shares in the wholesale 
market.
•  There is a pay-as-bid pricing mechanism (prices as 
bid). Auction winners are paid a price equal to the 
bids of the offeror. 
41
•  Ceiling prices are disclosed after the submitted bids 
are  opened.  SIGET  is  responsible  for  setting  the 
ceiling  prices  for  each  technology  and  approving 
the bidding documents.
El Salvador’s second renewable energy auction began 
in  2016,  when  DELSUR  opened  a  bidding  process 
to procure a total capacity of up to 170 MW of non-
conventional  renewables  (70  MW  of  wind,  100  MW 
of  solar  PV).  The  PPA  contracts  were  set  to  20-year 
lengths,  with  the  auction  rules  stipulating  that  solar 
PV projects had to be online and operational by April 
2019, while wind projects had to come online by April 
2020.  Additionally,  solar  PV  and  wind  projects  had 
capacity requirements of between 5 MW and 50 MW. 
•  There 
is  no  specified 
for  project 
development,  and  bidders  can  propose  project 
sites.
location 
• 
 The winners of the bidding process are obliged to 
deliver  the  total  amount  of  electricity  generation 
awarded  to  them  under  a  PPA  that  runs  for  a 
20  year  period.  The  PPA  guarantees  that  the 
distribution  companies  will  buy  all  the  energy 
produced by the generator at an established rate, 
as  a  take  or  pay  commitment.  For  distributed 
generation, the bidding process offers PPAs for a 
period  of  five  to  20  years,  but  most  of  the  PPAs 
awarded so far have been for 15 years.
DELSUR  again  represented  a  group  of  the  same 
seven distribution companies participating in the first 
and  second  auction  processes,  with  62  companies 
registered  to  participate 
in  this  tender.  DELSUR 
received  29  bids  from  19  companies,  resulting  in  four 
solar PV projects and one wind project winning PPAs, 
for a total awarded capacity of 169.9 MW (see Table 4). 
The price reduction over the course of the two rounds 
of  grid-connected  generation  reflects  a  learning 
curve in local project development. Several obstacles 
were  identified  during  the  first  auction  round  and 
later  improved.  These  improvements  included:  a 
greater  ability  for  small  projects  to  negotiate  more 
competitive equipment prices; increased experience in 
Salvadoran commercial banks with renewable energy 
project finance; and stronger interest from multilateral 
investment banks and development banks in funding 
small projects in El Salvador.
•  The  PPA  establishes  a  determined  tariff  for  the 
energy  in  US  dollars,  including  yearly  indexation. 
The payment for the energy is made on a monthly 
basis.
•  The  PPA 
includes 
commitments 
the 
generators related to the construction period and 
commissioning of the power plant. Commissioning 
delays may lead to the execution of a completion 
bond.

Wholesale market auctions
Distributed generation auctions
The  first  energy  auction  process,  implemented  in 
December  2012,  saw  355  MW  of  LNG  generation 
procured  in  August  2013  (for  more  information, 
see  Section  3).  Following  this,  in  September  2013, 
electricity  distributor  DELSUR  opened  El  Salvador’s 
first renewable energy auction. This tendering process 
aimed  to  purchase  a  total  capacity  of  100  MW  from 
non-conventional  renewables  projects,  stipulating 
that  these  must  be  at  least  5  MW  in  capacity.  In 
this  auction,  the  PPA  contracts  were  set  with  20-
year  terms.  Ceiling  prices  for  bids,  revealed  post-
bidding, were USD 123.41/MWh for wind projects and 
USD 165.53/MWh for solar PV projects. 
El  Salvador’s  distribution  companies,  together  with 
the  CNE  and  SIGET,  then  opened  the  country’s  first 
distributed  renewable  energy  auction,  to  contract  a 
total  capacity  of  up  to  15  MW.  Of  this,  4  MW  was  to 
come  from  small  hydropower,  6  MW  from  solar  PV, 
4 MW from biogas, and 1 MW from residential customers 
with  renewable  energy  self-generation  systems  up  to 
5 kW. 
In this first auction, SIGET received bids for 58 small-
scale renewable energy projects, mainly from national 
project developers, from which SIGET selected a total 
of  35  projects  for  the  off  takers,  comprised  of  seven 
distribution  companies.  In  this  first  auction,  the  PPAs 
carried a 15 year contract term, fixed in US dollars, with 
prices indexed to the CPI for all urban consumers in the 
USA. The project developer had to present a guarantee 
for  maintenance  of  the  offer  and  a  guarantee  for 
fulfilment of the contract. In this auction, many bidders 
were unable to reach financial closure on their projects. 
As a result, most of these developers sold their PPA to 
a private equity firm based in the USA. 
 
This  first  auction  contracted  94  MW  of  solar  PV 
capacity under 20-year PPAs, while no wind projects 
were  allocated,  as  offers  exceeded  the  ceiling  price. 
The winning companies were also required to direct 3% 
of project profits to social development programmes 
in the cities where the projects were based.

In  2018,  CNE  launched  a  new  tender  process  for 
distributed renewable energy sources. This technology 
specific  tender  process  focused  on  the  following 
technologies with the respective auctioned capacity: 
rooftop  solar  PV  (10  MW),  biogas  (8  MW)  and  on-
ground  solar  PV  (10  MW)  (CNE,  n.d.).  The  results  of 
this auction were published in March 2019 and can be 
found in Table 5.

Renewable energy project procedures 
and permits 
of the project development lifecycle. These procedures 
are  carried  out  and  permits  obtained  sequentially, 
beginning with the project profile formulation and the 
pre-feasibility study. In the pre-investment stage, the 
feasibility,  electrical  and  the  environmental  impact 
studies  are  carried  out  until  the  final  design  of  the 
project is concluded. 
The  development  of  renewable  energy  projects  in 
El Salvador requires that a number of procedures be 
followed  and  various  permits  acquired.  A  range  of 
government offices deal with these, at different stages

Once the project is operational, the generator should 
make a payment to SIGET for the registration update, 
which  considers  the  amount  of  electricity  generated 
(MWh) and injected into the grid during the previous 
year.  Additionally,  it  is  essential  to  submit  annual 
operation  and  environmental  audit  reports  to  the 
MARN.  At  the  end  of  a  project’s  operations,  the 
disconnection procedures, the abandonment plan and 
the withdrawal of the generator register in the SIGET 
are carried out.
The  procedures  indicated  in  Figure  21  are  carried 
out  by  different  agencies  within  the  power  sector, 
including:
•  distribution  companies  –  responsible  for  network 
interconnection  application, 
access 
feasibility, 
interconnection agreement
•  ETESAL – responsible for network access feasibility, 
interconnection 
application,

contract
The  General  Electricity  Law  states  that  geothermal 
and hydropower projects require different concession 
procedures. Once a project developer has developed 
the  feasibility  studies  for  the  exploitation  of  the 
in  a  determined  area,  the  concession 
resource 
should  go  through  an  open  tender  process,  where 
it  is  awarded  to  the  lowest  price  bidder,  unless  the 
following happens after the auction:
•  System  Operator  and  Market  –  responsible  for 
application to sign interconnection contract
•  SIGET – responsible for the application for studies, 
registration,  concession  request  for  hydro  and 
geothermal projects, tax incentive certification.
The  procedures  listed  above  are  performed  by  the 
following government institutions:
•  The  hydropower  developer  that  carried  the  costs 
of the feasibility study offers a bid of at least 90% 
of the winning bid.
• 
the major’s office, for building permits
•  The geothermal developer that carried the costs of 
the feasibility study offers a bid of at least 85% of 
the winning bid.
• 
the  Department  of  Housing 
and  Urban 
Development (VMDU – Viceministerio de Vivienda 
y  Desarrollo  Urbano)  for  construction  feasibility, 
and building permits
Additionally,  the  General  Electricity  Law  streamlines 
licensing procedures for hydro and geothermal power 
projects below 5 MW of installed capacity, which are 
specified under the Regulatory Law for the Concession 
of Small-Scale Power Generation Projects.
• 
the  Ministry  of  Health  (MINSAL  –  Ministerio  de 
Salud) for authorisation of the project permit
• 
the Ministry of Culture (MICULTURA – Ministerio de 
Cultura) for technical inspection requests
According  to  private  sector  officials  and  several 
project  developers,  the  project  procedures  and 
permitting processes currently in place have created 
unfavourable cost implications, delays and uncertainty 
for renewable energy projects. Despite a certain degree 
of  learning  and  improvement  in  the  documentation 
of  procedures,  it  has  been  suggested  there  remains 
insufficient  technical  knowledge  in  several  public 
offices  to  enable  them  to  effectively  carry  out  the 
permitting  procedures.  The  necessary  paperwork  is 
also dispersed across various institutions, with a lack 
of clarity on responsibilities. 
• 
the  National  Administration  of  Aqueducts  and 
Sewers  (ANDA  –  Administración  Nacional  de 
Acueductos y Alcantarillados) for feasibility studies
• 
the MARN for environmental building permits
• 
the MH for tax incentive approvals.
During the investment stage for project construction, 
the procedures for property inscription at the mayor’s 
office, work reception by the VMVDU and for release 
of the environmental compliance bond are performed.

Renewable energy project pipeline 
LaGeo  has  advanced  research  in  two  geothermal 
reservoirs  with  generation  potential,  at  project  sites 
known as Berlin and Chinameca. The development of 
the  7  MW  binary  cycle  Project  II  at  Berlin  has  been 
completed and is expected to be operational by 2021.
In  addition  to  being  the  state  company  that  has 
historically  been  in  charge  of  developing  renewable 
energy  and  fossil  energy  resources  in  El  Salvador, 
CEL also formulated the National Plan for Integrated 
Energy Development (1988 2000). After this, several 
feasibility studies and investment plans were created 
to  outline  future  development  of  generation  from 
renewable  energy  resources,  including  hydropower, 
geothermal, solar PV, wind, and biogas, as well as the 
introduction of ocean energy (tidal energy). 
As part of its duties, the CNE is tasked with preparing 
the  Indicative  Plan  for  Generation  Expansion  2018 
2028, which identifies potential candidate projects for 
development. 
This plan assesses the status of the current Salvadoran 
electricity  system  to  evaluate  capacity  expansion 
options that can promote renewable energy resources, 
support  the  reliability  of  the  power  system  and  help 
ensure electricity supply at competitive prices. 
As  mentioned  above,  in  recent  years,  CEL  has  carried 
out  an  expansion  of  the  99.4  MW  hydropower 
plant  5  de  Noviembre,  with  the  addition  of  two  new 
generating units of 40 MW each. These came online in 
2017  and  will  allow  the  plant  to  harness  surplus  water 
that  occurs  during  the  rainy  season.  CEL’s  65.7  MW 
El Chaparral hydropower plant is also under construction, 
and is expected to begin operations in 2021.
Projects  included  in  the  generation  plan,  shown  in 
Table  6,  have  undergone  studies  and  consultations 
between  the  CNE  and  project  owners.  The  list  of 
projects does not include those that are already under 
construction, nor those that have long-term PPAs, as 
these are considered firm projects that could be part 
of the generation system.

The  list  of  projects  in  the  generation  plan  includes 
four geothermal generation units, totalling 30 MW of 
installed capacity, which are already in the development 
phase.  It  also  includes  a  total  of  76  MW  of  installed 
capacity  expansion  at  three  existing  geothermal 
power stations. In addition, the plan includes six solar 
PV plants, totalling over 250 MW of installed capacity 
and one 40 MW wind project. Several potential fossil 
fuel generation facilities are also included in the plan, 
including  two  bunker-oil  generation  plants,  totalling 
200 MW of installed capacity, and an LNG plant with 
150 MW of installed capacity. 
first  energy  bidding  process  in  El  Salvador  back  in 
2012. It will also cover a large part of the distribution 
companies’  demand.  Following  the  plant  coming 
online, the allocation of new PPAs for renewables will 
likely depend on the growth of electricity demand and 
future energy policy.
The  price  of  the  electricity  generated  by  EDP 
(according to the project’s financial contract) depends 
on the international price of natural gas. In the case of 
the gas supply contract, this price is indexed in turn to 
Brent oil. Therefore, the prices of electricity generated 
by EDP will depend on the development of oil prices. 
It  is  expected that a gas  power  plant  shows a lower 
variable  generation  cost  than  other  thermal  plants. 
Thus,  following  the  order  of  merit,  EDP  electricity 
would  be  dispatched  first  and  those  thermal  plants 
based on Bunker C fuel oil, with higher prices, would 
be dispatched later. 
Furthermore, in 2017, SIGET evaluated and certified a 
set  of  nine  renewable  energy  projects,  representing 
a potential of over 150 MW of installed solar PV and 
biomass capacity (see Appendix 4). This certification 
was  a  necessary  step  for  compliance  with  the 
renewable  energy  fiscal  incentives  law,  and  thus 
exemption  of  the  relevant  taxes  for  project  owners. 
There  is  some  uncertainty,  however,  whether  these 
projects will be completed. 
The  Indicative  Plan  for  the  Expansion  of  Electricity 
Generation of El Salvador 2018-2035 also shows the 
EDP plant displacing thermal plants based on Bunker 
C fuel oil in dispatch. This Indicative Plan shows that 
the  marginal  cost  of  operation  (equivalent  to  the 
wholesale price of electricity for a cost-based system) 
would  be  lower  during  the  EDP  plant’s  first  years  of 
operation.  In  later  years  (between  2023  to  2035), 
the  marginal  cost  then  tends  to  stabilise,  between 
USD 64/MWh and USD 117/ MWh.
In  2017,  too,  SIGET  issued  agreements  for  three 
hydropower projects (see Appendix 5), which will be 
presented before the Legislative Assembly in order to 
be granted concessions for the use of water resources.
The CNE has also developed an online portal5 listing 
renewable energy projects in El Salvador. In addition 
to those projects that have obtained PPAs in auctions, 
the portal presents a set of renewable energy projects 
that  includes  distributed  generation  in  the  retail 
market,  small  hydropower  projects,  and  bioenergy 
power plants.
The other component in the tariff price is the cost of 
the  contract  price.  This  is  composed  of  the  variable 
costs  of  generation  associated  with  the  cost  of  fuel 
and machinery efficiency, operation and maintenance 
(O&M)  costs,  and  the  premium  component,  which 
covers  the  investment  costs,  fixed  costs  and  the 
expected  profit  by  the  project’s  investors  (SIGET, 
2012).
El  Salvador  also  has  considerable  experience  in  the 
installation of solar PV systems in the off grid sector. 
A  register  of  solar  PV  systems  carried  out  by  CNE 
reports 3 182 solar PV systems of 75 W each installed 
in 167 rural communities, serving an estimated 3 000 
families.
The  electricity  sale  price  in  the  contract  should  be 
similar to the costs of thermal plants based on Bunker 
C. For this reason, the EDP project is not expected to 
contribute to a decrease in electricity prices. Based on 
these assumptions, market prices in the future can be 
expected to allow renewable energy power plants to 
be  economically viable, displacing thermal  Bunker C 
and other fuel oil-based thermal plants along the way.
An  additional  project,  which  will  have  important 
implications for the future of the power sector, given 
its  capacity  size,  is  the  380  MW  EDP  LNG  project, 
expected  to  be  commissioned  in  2021.  This  project 
already  holds  a  PPA,  which  was  awarded  during  the

Renewable energy financing 
Together with the Netherlands Development Finance 
Company  (FMO)  and  the  French  development  bank, 
Proparco  (Société  de  Promotion  et  de  Participation 
pour la Coopération Economique S.A.), IDB provided a 
financial package for the construction of El Salvador’s 
Capella solar PV project. Capella is the second largest 
solar  power  generation  project  in  the  country,  with 
140  MW  of  installed  capacity.  The  financial  package 
for  the  project  has  a  tenor  of  up  to  18  years  and  is 
comprised of three loans of USD 28 million each (IDB 
Invest, 2018). 
In  the  1990s,  El  Salvador’s  energy  reform  process 
provided a starting point for future renewable energy 
investment  flows  in  the  country.  Regulatory  stability 
and enabling policies are critical to renewable energy 
finance, as they help ensure the transparency essential 
for market-based financing schemes (IRENA, 2016). 
In  this  context,  El  Salvador’s  liberalised  approach  to 
the energy sector provides the basis for the enabling 
framework needed to scale-up future private financing 
within  the  sector,  with  the  initial  support  of  public 
financing.  Thus  far,  renewable  energy  investments 
in the country have largely been the result of public 
financing. 
In addition, IDB seeks new opportunities for promoting 
national  and  regional  energy  integration.  It  aims  to 
minimise  fluctuations  in  energy  prices,  reduce  waste 
and  losses  in  transmission,  and  thus  increase  energy 
security in the Americas and the Caribbean. The Bank 
is  aware  that  by  diversifying  the  energy  mix  of  each 
country, it will help reduce the effects of climate change 
and the costs of system operation (IDBa, 2018).
The Central American Bank for Economic Integration 
(CABEI)  provides  key 
for 
renewable  energy  projects.  CABEI’s  objective  is  to 
finance projects that have an impact on economic and 
social development and help fulfil the bank’s broader 
mission of economic integration in the region. As part 
of  its  past  financing  efforts,  the  bank  has  provided 
funding  for  the  SIEPAC  project,  renewable  energy 
generation  initiatives  at  local  and  regional  level, 
energy diversification programmes, and transmission 
and  distribution  system  projects.  In  2017,  CABEI 
approved loans for the energy sector that amounted to 
USD 632.3 million, representing 32.8% of its approved 
loans for the year (CABEI, 2018). 
investment  support 
In recent years, there have been efforts made to support 
small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), for energy 
efficiency  and  renewable  energy  investments.  IDB 
has,  for  example,  provided  a  USD  20  million  loan  to 
El Salvador for the creation of a financing line aiming 
to promote SMEs investment in energy efficiency. This 
programme  is  supplemented  by  a  non-reimbursable 
technical co operation component, which will develop 
energy  savings  measurements,  and  a  financial  risk 
transfer  instrument,  which  favours  energy  efficiency 
investments (IDBb, 2018).
CABEI,  together  with  the  German  Development 
Bank (KfW), administer a funding programme in the 
region  under  the  Latin  America  Investment  Facility 
(LAIF) from the European Union (EU) that comprises 
renewable  energy  projects.  One  such  project  to 
receive  financing  support  was  the  expansion  of  the 
5 de Noviembre hydroelectric plant, mentioned above.
Recently, CABEI also launched the Green SME initiative. 
This  creates  credit  lines  to  finance  investments  of 
up  to  USD  5  million  in  projects  that  aim  to  reduce 
SME  energy  consumption  by  15%,  and/or  renewable 
energy projects with a maximum installed capacity of 
5 MW. This credit line is supported by KfW and the EU 
(CABEI, 2020).
BANDESAL,  as  the  national  development  bank, 
provides  financing  to  support  feasibility  studies  and 
other pre-investment activities for renewable energy 
projects. The bank can fund renewable projects either 
directly  or  through  first-tier  commercial  banking. 
Beyond  BANDESAL,  at  the  national  level,  the  Banco 
Hipotecario state bank and several commercial banks 
in El Salvador also offer financing lines with their own 
resources  for  the  construction  of  renewable  energy 
projects.
Meanwhile, private investment in existing infrastructure 
in El Salvador is still limited. The country has, however, 
facilitated the financing of renewable energy projects 
awarded  in  the  framework  of  the  tendering  process, 
as  in  the  case  of  private  equity  funds  supported  by 
institutional 
investors.  Additionally,  export  credit 
agencies have also provided financing in the form of 
long-term credits. 
El  Salvador  has  functioning  capital  markets,  with 
private  pension 
in  corporate 
bonds  securitised  by  future  cash  flows  from  public 
infrastructure.  This  has  become  an  important  source 
of financing for renewable energy project developers 
in the country (USAID, 2018).
Based on its objectives, the IDB supports El Salvador 
in financing projects for the development of renewable 
energy, for research projects and the development of 
pilot programmes to verify the viability of renewable 
energy alternatives.

Box 6.  Climate Investment Platform (CIP)
The CIP is a global initiative supported by IRENA, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and 
Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All), in co-operation with the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The CIP’s objective is to 
step up climate action and translate ambitious national climate targets into concrete investments on the ground 
(IRENA, n.d. a). Whilst initially focused on energy transition, the ultimate goal of the initiative is to accelerate 
investments in renewable energy and enable the success of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
The platform offers an avenue to strengthen existing collaboration and presents an opportunity to consider 
new ways for more effectively bringing together stakeholders to catalyse action, all within existing institutional 
structures and in line with the respective mandates of the partner organisations.
In this context, investment forums, a key element of IRENA’s strategy to facilitate investments in renewable 
energy,  offer  an  effective  organising  framework  for  the  implementation  of  the  CIP  through  a  sub-regional 
approach. 
The sub-regional forums have two main aims: to strengthen the ability of decision-makers to build a strong 
enabling  environment  for  renewable  energy  investments;  and  to  support  developers  in  preparing  bankable 
projects and accessing finance. Post-forum project support is also provided.
In  operationalising  the  CIP,  IRENA  intends  to  work  closely  with  multilateral,  bilateral  and  local  financial 
institutions, development partners and other institutions that are prepared to provide financial and/or technical 
resources, and/or support the realisation of projects, as well as private companies and private investors. 
In Latin America and the Caribbean, IRENA aims to implement two sub-regional investment forums: one for 
Central America and the Caribbean and a second one for South America. Both events aim to scale up renewable 
energy  investments  in  the  region,  support  project  development  and  implementation,  and  contribute  to  the 
creation of policy and regulatory frameworks conducive to renewable energy investments. Key forum activities 
will include matchmaking between project developers, potential financiers and investors. Renewable energy 
projects, along with renewable-based electricity grid and energy efficiency projects, may be considered for 
support (IRENA, n.d. b).

  addressing the main barriers  
  hindering the deployment of

targets and long-term plans. Positive implementation 
can  lead  to  a  strengthened  investment  environment 
for  renewables  and  improve  the  country’s  policy 
stability.
This  section  presents  the  main  challenges  to  the 
deployment  of  renewable  energy  in  El  Salvador 
identified  during  the  RRA  process.  This  included  a 
review  of  the  literature,  insights  from  respondent 
interviews,  outcomes  from  focus  groups  and  multi-
stakeholder  roundtable  discussions  held  during 
consultative  workshops,  along  with  subsequent 
exchanges with selected stakeholders. 
Indeed, a long term national energy plan should take 
a holistic approach to cover the diverse aspects of the 
energy sector. This approach should include: the use 
of clean technologies for the heating sector; expansion 
of the generation fleet and transmission infrastructure; 
and  integration  with  the  regional  electricity  market, 
which  is  very  relevant  for  El  Salvador,  due  to  its 
regional interconnection via SIEPAC.
Each of these challenges is presented below, together 
with  a  set  of  corresponding  short-  to  medium  term 
recommendations  aimed  at  addressing 
them, 
including, where relevant, actions being taken by the 
government. 
Action 1: Establish a long-term plan for the energy 
sector
Enhance long-term planning and policy 
for the renewable energy sector
During  the  RRA  process,  stakeholder  consultation 
revealed the need for a more comprehensive national 
energy  plan.  This  plan  should  encompass  all  energy 
technologies,  suppliers  and  consumers  through  an 
integrated analysis of the current market conditions, 
and 
include  an  evaluation  of  energy  demand, 
power  and  heat  availability,  grid  expansion,  off-grid 
strategies,  and  other  subjects.  By  undertaking  this 
long-term  plan,  a  more  co-ordinated  approach  can 
be  sought  for  the  expansion  of  the  generation  and 
transmission system. 
The  National  Energy  Policy  2010-2024  provided  the 
momentum  needed  to  promote  the  development  of 
renewables and diversify the country’s energy supply, 
after years of fossil fuel based generation and a slow-
paced  development  of  renewable  energy.  In  recent 
years,  the  introduction  of  competitive  tendering 
processes and various fiscal incentives for renewable 
electricity  has  contributed  to  a  positive  business 
environment for renewables in El Salvador.
 
The CNE prepares the Indicative Plan for Generation 
Expansion, which analyses the expected evolution of 
electricity  demand  over  a  period  of  approximately 
10  years  and  proposes  different  technologies  for  its 
supply. This study assesses scenarios for the growth 
of energy demand in different sectors of the economy 
During  the  RRA  consultation  process,  however, 
numerous  stakeholders  highlighted  the  negative 
impact on renewable energy development from a lack 
of  institutional  co-ordination  on  long-term  energy 
plans.  Therefore,  an  inclusive  approach  between  all 
parties  is  vital  when  developing  renewable  energy

(industrial,  services,  transport,  etc.),  analysing  the 
national  capacity  for  supply.  Likewise,  ETESAL  is 
responsible for carrying out the long-term expansion 
plan  of  the  national  transmission  network.  Both 
reports  are  an  important  input  in  the  development 
of  a  national  energy  plan,  but  require  better  co-
ordination  between  both  institutions  to  achieve  an 
efficient development of power sector infrastructure. 
Additionally,  it  is  recommendable  to  have  a  closer 
involvement of SIGET in the whole process, to ensure 
the appropriate approval of the plan.
an 
through

consultative process, CNE is developing its long term 
National  Energy  Policy  for  the  period  2020-2050. 
This  includes  targets  for  the  share  of  clean  energy 
technologies in end-use sectors, such as industry and 
transport.  Moreover,  the  new  National  Energy  Policy 
aims to promote the development of pilot projects in 
the  direct  use  of  renewable  energy  resources  in  the 
industrial and agri-food sectors.
Action  3:  Align  with  the  regional,  ECLAC-SICA 
Energy Strategy 2030
Furthermore,  power  system  expansion  plans  need  to 
address the issue of operational flexibility in the power 
system.  The  deployment  of  VRE  generation  has  to 
be  accompanied  by  actions  that  give  the  system  the 
operational flexibility it needs to cope with short term 
variability and to allow the system to operate reliably. 
Planning  efforts  should  explore  all  possible  options, 
including  investments  in  transmission  and  storage,  as 
well as other base-load technologies such as geothermal 
and  hydropower,  which  can  enhance  flexibility.  These 
efforts  should  also  look  at  the  specification  of  the 
technological  mix  of  renewable  generation  capacity 
additions that results in the lowest overall costs for the 
system,  together  with  additions  without  short  term 
variability, such as geothermal or biomass.
Regional  integration  in  Central  America  has  played 
an  important  role  in  the  Salvadorian  power  system. 
SIEPAC acts as a backbone for the electricity network, 
with the country playing an active role in the MER as 
one of the largest importers of power. 
El  Salvador  can  continue  benefiting  from  regional 
integration  by  aligning  its  efforts  with  regional 
strategies  for  electricity  development.  SICA  and 
ECLAC  are  currently  developing  the  2030  energy 
strategy  for  SICA  countries,  which  provides  a 
comprehensive  approach 
regional  energy 
development,  and  identifies  priorities  for  countries 
in  pursuit  of  sustainable  energy  development. 
El  Salvador  should  incorporate  this  strategy  in  its 
national  long-term  planning  efforts,  in  order  to 
maximise  renewable  energy  resources  from  outside 
the country. This strategy must also remain in line with 
the  country’s  overall  development  strategy,  assuring 
the participation of both public and private sectors.
for 
Action  2:  Promote  renewables  for  end  uses  in 
buildings, heat and transport.
El  Salvador  has  focused  its  efforts  on  renewable 
energy penetration of the power sector. This has led 
to an increasing share of renewables in the electricity 
mix and a reduction in the sector’s reliance for fossil 
fuels.  When  analysing  the  national  energy  mix, 
however,  the  consumption  of  electricity  in  end  use 
sectors  represents  about  20%,  with  approximately 
79%  of  final  energy  consumption  supplied  by  fossil 
fuels.  Thus,  the  share  taken  by  renewable  energy 
remains low in these sectors.
Some  progress  has  already  been  achieved  in  this, 
by  including  regional  energy  integration  as  one  of 
the  strategic  components  of  the  new,  El  Salvador 
National  Energy  Policy  2020-2050.  This  should  also 
be reflected as part of a more comprehensive national 
energy plan, however.
Action 4: Incorporate distributed power generation 
into comprehensive long-term electricity planning
El  Salvador  does  not  currently  have  targets  for 
renewables  in  end-use  sectors,  either.  Establishing 
targets  for  renewable  energy  in  transport,  heating 
and cooling, agriculture and industry could contribute 
to  a  further  scale-up  of  renewables  in  the  country, 
and  help  achieve  emissions  reduction  targets  while 
creating  new  business  opportunities.  Furthermore, 
renewable  energy 
in  end-use  sectors  can  help 
facilitate the integration of ancillary services, such as 
storage applications.
As  is  the  case  in  many  countries,  net-metering  can 
be  an  effective  instrument  to  spur  the  development 
of  distributed  renewable  power  generation.  Careful 
implementation  is  critical,  however,  to  avoid  risking 
efficient  cost-recovery  in  the  system  and  to  prevent 
cross subsidisation between those customers who self 
consume and those who do not (IRENA, IEA, REN21, 
2018).

national distributed power generation strategy should 
be pursued. 
purchase  contracts.  Likewise,  geothermal  project 
developers  struggle  to  access  financing  instruments 
at a local level. This is because financing institutions 
do  not  have  the  capacity  for  geothermal  project 
financing, or for overcoming high upfront investment 
costs  to  achieve  bankable  projects.  Most  of  the 
current  existing  financing  mechanisms  are  provided 
by  multilateral  development  banks  and  international 
organisations 
in  Central  America,  such  as  the 
Geothermal  Development  Facility  for  Latin  America 
(GDF).
This strategy would need to be based on integration 
with El Salvador’s indicative generation plan. It should 
also include a rigorous analysis of distributed power 
generation potential and its impact on the economics 
of the power market. This is important to encourage 
self consumption, which can drive producers to more 
system  friendly  behaviour,  while  ensuring  the  fair 
distribution  of  anticipated  dividends,  so  that  net-
metering may be seen as mutually beneficial to both 
buyer and seller. 
In  addition,  the  existing  regulatory  framework  for 
geothermal  energy  in  El  Salvador  focuses  mainly 
on  power  generation  and  does  not  address  direct 
use  applications  of  the  resource.  The  absence  of  a 
regulatory  framework  for  direct  use  applications  for 
geothermal energy hampers the scaling-up of existing 
pilot projects and the provision of a proper investment 
environment  for  the  attraction  of  private  finance  to 
the sector. 
This  strategy  should  also  incorporate  studies  on 
current 
levels  of  distributed  renewable  energy 
generation  and  future  maximum  penetration  levels. 
Obtaining  statistics  would  help  provide  distribution 
companies  with  the  necessary  analyses  needed  to 
accurately  forecast  demand,  as  well  as  indicate  the 
growth potential of the distributed generation market 
to project development companies. The strategy could 
also consider the implementation of new technologies 
as distributed storage, which could promote a wider 
use  of  distributed  renewables  development,  without 
the constraint of having maximum penetration levels.
Action  5:  Improve  geothermal  energy  policy  and 
regulatory frameworks 
El Salvador only has a regulatory framework covering 
power  applications.  This

geothermal  projects  below  5  MW.  To  improve  this 
situation, it is recommended to establish a classification

adequate procedures for the different potential uses 
of the geothermal resource. 
includes 
Moreover, this strategy should be fully integrated with 
long  term  electricity  planning  efforts.  The  evolution 
of distributed generation must be understood in the 
wider  context  of  the  evolution  of  the  power  system 
as a whole. The strategy must also reflect the extent 
to  which  distributed  generation  offers  a  meaningful 
alternative, from both the technical and the economic 
point  of  view,  in  meeting  the  country’s  electricity 
needs.

frameworks 
for 
Currently,  the  use  of  geothermal  heat  for  other 
purposes, such as air conditioning, agriculture industry, 
tourism  and  medicine,  only  requires  complying  with 
environmental procedures and obtaining construction 
permits  from  the  respective  municipality.  A  process 
therefore  needs  to  be  initiated  to  devise  a  special 
regulatory  framework  for  this  type  of  application, 
providing an opportunity for scaling-up such projects 
to an industrial level. A clear regulatory framework for 
direct  use  applications  will  serve  to  attract  investors 
and leverage private finance for geothermal direct use 
projects. 
Create enabling conditions for 
geothermal energy development 
Despite having a long tradition of geothermal energy 
use,  mainly  for  power  generation,  El  Salvador’s 
geothermal  development  has  stagnated  in  recent 
years,  with  a  limited  number  of  new  projects  for 
geothermal power generation, or heating applications. 
Geothermal  power  projects  face  challenges  with  the 
existing remuneration scheme, being sometimes at a 
disadvantage  compared  to  other  renewable  energy 
sources  –  especially  in  accessing  long-term  energy 
An  increased  deployment  of  direct  use  applications 
would  also  bring  a  range  of  benefits  to  El  Salvador. 
52
Such  uses  of  geothermal  heat  can  create  a  more 
sustainable  energy  future  for  the  country,  increase 
food security and decrease dependency on fossil fuels. 
This  diversification  into  direct  use  can  also  increase 
the benefits received by communities located close to 
geothermal  resources.  Indeed,  some  direct  use  pilot 
projects already implemented in the country provide 
strong evidence of such benefits to the community.
for  local  financial  institutions  and  project  owners 
could  contribute  to  an  increased  understanding  of 
geothermal project financing and risks. 
In  addition,  the  capacity  of  project  developers  in 
project financing aspects, such as pricing mechanisms, 
inflation, and other key project parameters, needs to 
be strengthened in order to improve the preparatory 
stage of geothermal projects. Likewise, the possibility 
could be considered of creating a governmental entity 
that provides technical and administrative support to 
investors and developers, both for the implementation 
of geothermal direct-use projects and for small-scale 
projects from any renewable resource.
While El Salvador has established a tendering process 
for  PPAs  in  renewable  energy,  this  has  only  been 
granted  to  solar,  wind,  bioenergy  and  small-scale 
hydropower  projects.  These 
long-term  contracts 
provide a secure remuneration mechanism through a 
guaranteed, stable price, helping to attract investment 
in  projects  and  allow  investment  recovery.  Utilising 
a  similar  contract  structure  tailored  for  geothermal 
projects  could  improve  the  investment  environment 
by  guaranteeing  financial  stability  for  those  projects 
commissioned.
Furthermore,  available  risk  mitigation  instruments 
are  specifically  designed  for  electricity  generation 
projects. The need therefore remains to identify – or 
possibly  create  –  similar  financial  instruments  that 
support  the  development  of  geothermal  direct  use 
projects  for  applications  beyond  the  power  sector. 
Some  opportunities  can  be  found  within  existing 
platforms,  such  as  the  GDF,  or  funds  for  industrial 
development.
El  Salvador  has  also  undertaken  four  rounds  of 
renewable  energy  auctions  for  generation  as  part 
of  the  wholesale  market  and  distributed  generation, 
in  which  geothermal  did  not  participate.  As  the 
economics  of  geothermal  projects  generally  require 
higher upfront investment for the initial development 
phase, compared to solar and wind projects, they can 
struggle  to  compete  in  renewable  energy  tenders 
based purely on a cost bid basis (US dollars per kWh). 
It  is  recommendable  to  initiate  an  assessment  to 
determine  the  best  mechanism  to  allow  geothermal 
projects  to  compete  equally  with  other  renewable 
technologies  in  future  tender  processes.  This  could 
be  done  by  eventually  adjusting  the  parameters  of 
El  Salvador’s  renewable  energy  auction  scheme, 
while also accounting for advantages associated with 
dispatchable  power  generation,  such  as  providing 
balancing support and enhancing system flexibility. 
Furthermore,  the  adoption  of  the  United  Nations

to  unlocking  financing  for  geothermal  projects.  This

the  country  necessary  to  support  the  establishment 
of geothermal projects. It also assesses the maturity 
of  relevant  project  studies  and  commitments  in  the 
implementation  of  the  project,  as  well  as  looking  at 
the level of confidence in the potentially recoverable 
resource.  Therefore,  through  the  application  of  this 
methodology, investors are able to compare different 
geothermal projects across different countries – and 
against  other  energy  resources  –  before  making 
investment decisions.

Additionally, the current regulation for the concession 
of  geothermal  and  hydropower  projects  should  be 
assessed  to  generate  an  environment  of  trust  for 
project  developers,  attracting  investments  in  the

the  geothermal  industry  that  can  also,  potentially,

is  needed  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  in 
response to the needs of the energy sector. 
To  promote  the  direct  utilisation  of  geothermal 
resources,  El  Salvador  could  also  learn  from  more 
experienced  countries.  This  co-operation  can  be 
financial  or  technical,  or  include  technology  transfer 
for  many  geothermal  direct  use  applications.  Co-
operation  can  take  place  using  existing  platforms, 
thanks  to  the  presence  in  the  region  of  multilateral 
organisations  that  promote  exchanges  between 
educational 
in  geothermal  energy 
research.  These  include  El  Salvador’s  Geothermal 
Centre  of  Excellence  (see  Box  3),  as  well  as  co-
operation  projects  created  under  South-South/
triangular co-operation modalities.
The  strategic  development  of  that  sector  is  also 
hindered by the absence of longer term co-ordination 
of different participant’s action plans. Improving these 
institutional  frameworks is  critical in  creating  a clear 
path towards a sustainable energy future, which goes 
beyond the power sector by including renewables in 
transport, heating, cooling and direct use.

Action  9:  Improve  co-ordination  of  expansion 
planning for transmission and generation
Action 8: Increase public awareness of geothermal 
energy potential 
the  development  of 
the  national 
Currently, 
transmission  system  and  of  new  generation  facilities 
are  tasks  undertaken  separately.  In  addition,  the 
transmission  planning  structure  does  not  consider 
the  short  construction  periods  of  VRE  sources,  such 
as solar PV, that often require only around two years 
to  be  commissioned.  As  a  result,  generation  and 
transmission planners in El Salvador must frequently 
revise  and  update  plans,  while  new  potential 
renewable generation is not included in transmission 
expansion plans. 
The  government  of  El  Salvador,  along  with  the 
geothermal industry, should guarantee the continuity 
of  public  awareness  campaigns,  in  order  to  actively 
communicate the various socio-economic advantages 
of geothermal energy to the public, especially at the 
local  level.  In  doing  so,  the  potential  for  scaling-up 
direct-uses of geothermal energy could be promoted, 
while  the  need  to  involve  local  communities  in  the 
development of these resources could  be addressed 
–  a  particularly  important  factor  when  issuing  or 
renewing licences for geothermal development. 
ETESAL and CNE should therefore co-ordinate more 
closely  on  those  expansion  plans,  to  ensure  that 
renewable energy projects are not forgone arbitrarily 
due  to  expansion  timelines.  One  such  measure 
to  overcome  this  challenge  is  to  embark  on  the 
identification of renewable energy zones for the most 
suitable  areas  for  project  development.  These  zones 
would then inform both transmission and generation 
planners, facilitating a co-ordinated planning effort.
Currently, campaigns are in place in El Salvador that 
aim to raise public awareness of geothermal energy’s 
potential.  These  campaigns  are  important,  not  only 
in showing how geothermal energy can help address 
key  macroeconomic  challenges  related  to  energy 
security and climate change, but also in offering local 
economic opportunities and benefits. Furthermore, as 
a  baseload  generation  resource,  geothermal  energy 
can  contribute  to  the  efficient  integration  of  an 
increasing level of VRE in the power system, by acting 
as a balancing resource. 
Inter-institutional  co-ordination  will  be  crucial  in 
carrying  out  effective  planning.  In  addition,  the 
involvement of SIGET throughout the planning process 
will accelerate the approval process and enhance the 
dissemination of the planning exercise. 
54
systems creates a problem of distortion in the global 
statistics on demand growth. In turn, this can distort 
macroeconomic data, while also negatively impacting 
planned  generation  expansion  and  development 
programmes  for  the  transmission  and  distribution 
networks. The significance of this becomes apparent, 
too,  when  considering  that  self-generators  receive 
credit in kWh which can then be used to reduce their 
cost  electricity  consumption  during  their  particular 
billing period. 
Action 10: Enhance power system flexibility 
Besides  ensuring  that  planning  efforts  address  the 
topic of flexibility, in order to accommodate increasing 
shares of VRE generation technologies, regulation and 
market design must be adjusted to unlock all possible 
sources of flexibility in the power system.
The country has created a strong policy and regulatory 
framework to promote renewable energy penetration 
in the power sector. Nevertheless, additional measures 
can include: adapting dispatch and pricing procedures 
to  ensure  that  controllable  generators  deliver  all  the 
operational  flexibility  they  can;  adjusting  the  grid 
code technical performance requirements of inverter-
connected  variable  generators  to  ensure  that  they 
do  not  unnecessarily  increase  the  systemic  demand 
for  flexibility;  eliciting  demand  response;  promoting 
a market for auxiliary services (through systems that 
provide flexibility); and others.
The implementation of this net-metering scheme has 
seen mixed results. While rooftop solar PV generation 
has increased since the introduction of the regulation, 
studies have yet to be undertaken to establish current 
levels  of  distributed  generation  in  the  grid,  or  the 
maximum penetration levels of VRE in the distribution 
grid. 
As  such,  several  distribution  companies  have 
expressed  concerns  about  the  impact  of  growing 
distributed generation on the reliability of the power 
system.  Moreover,  although  growing  self-generation 
would increase overall renewable generation capacity 
in  El  Salvador,  excessive  distributed  generation 
capacity  installation  is  likely  to  alter  the  demand 
profile for distribution companies, as well as challenge 
their financial liquidity. 
The pace at which such measures will be implemented 
depends on the rate of increase of the share of VRE 
generation in the system. In this sense, the planning 
effort  must  serve  to  inform  regulators  and  policy 
makers, allowing them to implement such measures in 
a  timely  fashion,  adapting  the  regulatory  framework 
to  new  requirements.  Considering  the  possibility 
of  addressing  flexibility  needs  via  improvements  to 
the  regulation  and  market  design  can  complement 
strategies  based  on  new  investments  –  and  thus 
represent savings to electricity users.
Simultaneously, several project developers expressed 
concerns that an uneven playing field currently exists 
in  developing  distributed  generation  projects,  given 
that  subsidiaries  of  distribution  companies  also 
compete in the market. These companies may already 
have  a  commercial  relationship  with  the  customers, 
and  thus  have  access  to  customer  information  not 
available  to  other  project  developers.  Furthermore, 
project  developers  may  face  obstacles  and  delays 
in  realising  rooftop  solar  PV  projects,  as  distribution 
companies  do  not  want  to  lose  electricity  demand 
from a customer (and thus revenue).
Some  first  steps  have  been  taken  within  regulatory 
adjustments to encourage the penetration of VRE in 
the  national  electricity  system.  These  adjustments 
have included various amendments in the regulations 
for the operation of the transmission system and the 
wholesale  market,  based  on  production  costs  for 
dispatching.  They  also  include  conducting  studies 
of  the  spinning  reserve  with  a  view  to  the  further 
integration of VRE. 
 
Action  11:  Assess  the 
generation systems
impact  of  distributed 
Assess the implementation of distributed 
power generation
With  the  implementation  of  the  Norm  for  End  User 
Producers of Electrical Energy with Renewable Energy 
Sources,  the  use  of  solar  rooftop  systems  has  been 
growing  in  El  Salvador,  especially  in  the  commercial 
sector. 
Despite the effectiveness of the net metering scheme 
implemented  in  2017,6  periodic  reports  are  also 
needed  on  the  energy  generated  by  end-users,  who 
are  generally  residential  and  commercial  customers. 
They  can  generate  their  own  renewable  electricity 
and  feed  the  excess  generation  back  into  the  grid. 
lack  of  centralised  measurement  for  these 
The 
Measuring  the  impact  of  this  on  the  energy  market 
accurately  requires  some  important  steps.  These 
include  registering  all  the  existing  self-generation

55
solar  panels  in  use,  with  this  registration  including 
details  of  the  potential  amount  of  electricity  they 
can inject into the grid and how much of the power 
generated  is  for  self-use.  This  first  step  can  provide 
important  information  to  assess  the  impact  that  the 
implementation  of  distributed  generation  can  have 
on  the  different  energy  stakeholders,  such  as  grid 
operators,  distribution  companies,  final  users,  and 
others. This first assessment of distributed generation 
should not just focus on rooftop solar technologies. It 
should  also  include  other  power  generation  systems 
existing in the country, such as biogas and small hydro.
and  tax  incentive  approvals  are  under  the  remit  of 
municipal  offices,  VMVDU,  MINSAL,  MICULTURA, 
ANDA, MARN, and the MH. 
While  these  procedures  and  permits  are  carried  out 
in a sequential order, there is often repetition among 
permitting  offices,  a  limited  technical  capacity  in 
issuing agencies, and a lack of legal clarity concerning 
feedback  issued  to  project  developers.  At  the  same 
time,  municipal  tax  structures  for  projects  are 
unstable and often subject to change at the request 
of a mayor’s office, once approved by the Legislative 
Assembly.  Furthermore,  according  to  the  private 
sector,  compliance  with  the  Law  of  Legal  Stability 
and the Money Laundering Law has led to instances 
of excessive document requests and irrelevant project 
information being required.
the 
the 
Better  understanding  of 
impact  of 
implementation  of  distributed  generation 
in 
El  Salvador  among  the  different,  key  energy  sector 
actors can contribute to the assessment of the existing 
regulatory framework for the use of self-generation. 
Indeed, private sector representatives have indicated 
that this lack of co-ordination in the current process 
of  obtaining  permits  and  permissions  has  negative 
cost  implications,  creating  delay  and  uncertainty 
surrounding renewable energy project development. 
The  regulatory  aspects  for  distributed  generation 
must consider the stability of the grid and the existing 
distribution  market.  They  must  also  empower  the 
end  user  with  the  flexibility  of  energy  management. 
This can be reflected in the commercialisation of the 
distributed generation market, the conditions given by 
long term contracts and the application of innovative 
technologies,  such  as  digitalisation  and  blockchain, 
that  facilitate  transactions  among  the  distribution 
actors. El Salvador could use the experience of other 
countries in the application of such technologies, and 
evaluate a more adequate strategy for implementation, 
based on market growth.
When  it  comes  to  financing  such  projects,  it  is 
public  financial  institutions,  including  national  and 
international development organisations, that are the 
main players in the renewable energy debt market. On 
the other hand, via the implementation of guarantees 
and  other  risk  mitigation  tools,  private  financial 
institutions play a key role in renewable energy project 
finance. Yet, the availability of such private financing 
is still limited. A full assessment of the sufficiency of 
the current sources of public and private instruments 
in  financing  the  transition  towards  a  sustainable 
energy future needs to be carried out in the country, 
with alternatives that would expand the participation 
of private financing identified and deployed.
Foster project development and 
financing for renewables
There  have  been  significant  achievements  and 
progress  in  the  adjustment  of  the  regulation  for  the 
development  of  renewable  energy  in  El  Salvador. 
Reforms  of  the  General  Electricity  Law  must  be 
deepened,  however,  to  guarantee  that  the  benefits 
of  introducing  renewable  energy  reach  all  final 
consumers. 
Action  12:  Streamline  administrative  procedures 
and facilitate their enforcement
Streamlining  these  administrative  procedures  is  an 
important step in removing a key barrier to renewable 
energy project development in El Salvador. Regulation 
in this area should ensure procedures are transparent 
and timetables for various permitting processes have 
been defined clearly. Moreover, co-ordination should 
be  enhanced  among  the  various  government  offices 
involved in issuing permits, in order to reduce project 
delays and reduce development costs. 
Additionally, in El Salvador, administrative procedures 
and permits for the development of renewable energy 
projects  are  still  an  important  barrier.  These  are  not 
centralised,  with  registration  applications,  feasibility 
and interconnection studies and agreements, as well 
as  concession  requests  all  carried  out  by  different 
power  sector  agencies.  These  include  distribution 
companies,  ETESAL,  the  UT,  and  the  regulator. 
Moreover,  building  permits,  construction  feasibility 
studies, technical inspections, environmental permits 
One  such  mechanism  used  in  many  countries  to 
consolidate  the  responsibilities  of  administrative 
procedures  and  project  permitting  is  to  develop  a 
56
single  office  (a  “single-window  agency”)  to  handle 
and  resolve  most  of  the  applicable  licenses  and 
permits for renewable energy projects. This entity can 
be created as an independent legal body, or under an 
existing government office, and can be an important 
mechanism

in partially re-directing public financing to de-risking 
instruments  that  enable  the  participation  of  private 
lenders. 
An assessment of other types of financial instrument 
that  might  be  used  to  finance  renewable  energy 
projects in the country – such as Green Bonds – should 
also be undertaken. 
in  encouraging 
In  addition,  several  project  developers  expressed  the 
need to develop a single compliance certificate for the 
Money Laundering Law, valid for all institutions. Utilising 
this certification approach could help cut down project 
delays and provide clarity for project owners.
At  present,  national  or  international  development 
agencies,  such  as  the  World  Bank,  IDB,  KfW,  CABEI 
and BANDESAL, account for the bulk of the financial 
instruments  deployed 
the  capital 
structures of El Salvador’s renewable energy projects. 
Financial instruments provided by private institutions 
have,  however,  also  been  important  in  providing 
funding  for  the  energy  transition  in  the  country, 
especially  instruments  related  to  loans  and  risk 
mitigation mechanisms provided by guarantees.
in  financing 
Action 13: Assess sufficiency of prevalent financial 
instruments
The  sufficiency  of  the  prevailing  alternatives  for 
financing  renewable  energy  in  El  Salvador  must  be 
assessed  in  light  of  the  plans  to  deploy  renewable 
energy in the country. While the low costs of finance 
from public institutions can certainly have a positive 
impact  on  the  capital  mix  of  renewable  projects, 
limitations  on  the  availability  of  such  instruments 
must  also  take  account  of  the  volumes  needed  to 
realise El Salvador’s long-term deployment ambitions 
for  renewables.  A  realistic  assessment  for  the  long 
term is necessary, due to the time usually needed for 
those  measures  that  are  eventually  implemented  to 
expand the range of financial sources. 
Action  14:  Create  capacity  for 
financing of renewable energy projects
local  private 
An additional uncertainty for financial agencies when 
it comes to renewable energy projects in El Salvador 
is the relative lack of experience such agencies have 
in  financing  projects  of  this  type.  This  limits  the 
involvement of even those private financial institutions 
that  do  undertake  risk  mitigation  in  the  renewable 
energy arena. The capacities of local private financiers 
must therefore also be built up, in order to remove the 
knowledge barrier to renewable energy market entry.
On  the  other  hand,  existing  mechanisms  and 
conditions for finance and risk mitigation provided by 
private institutions must also be clear, to ensure that 
project developers can make use of these instruments 
for  renewable  energy  projects.  Existing  financial 
instruments in El Salvador must be evaluated in order 
to improve and maximise them. This would include an 
evaluation of improvements that could be made in the 
regulatory and contractual conditions that impact the 
remuneration of renewable energy projects, as well as 
Making  local  private  institutions  more  familiar  with 
this market can generate more interest from them in 
financing sector projects. At the same time, familiarity 
can improve the capability of existing mechanisms in 
facilitating access to project developers. Additionally, 
the  enhancement  of  local  finance  capacity  can  also 
promote the creation of new and potentially innovative 
mechanisms, making El Salvador’s renewable energy 
market more attractive to investors.
