I.  UNDP within the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Cooperation Framework  
1.  Since  restoring  independence  in  1991,  Georgia  has  sought  to  achieve  the  prosperity, 
stability  and  security  that  membership  of  the  European  Union  connotes  to  the  Georgian 
public.  Georgia  has  made  tangible  progress  on  this  path,  including  most  significantly  its 
signing of an Association Agreement with the European Union in 2014.  
2.  In tandem with its strong commitment to European integration, Georgia is energetically 
pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It has nationalized 93 priority targets 
and  established  a  robust  interministerial  mechanism  to  coordinate  national  efforts  and 
monitor  progress,  including  through  voluntary  national  reviews1  presented  at  the  United 
Nations High-Level Political Forums on Sustainable Development in 2016 and 2020.  
3.  The  two  agendas  are  increasingly  recognized  as  complementary.  The  Association 
Agreement alone incorporates 63 per cent of the country’s nationalized SDG targets. Taken 
together, they map out a clearly sign-posted development pathway for Georgia and provide 
a mutually reinforcing framework for United Nations work in 2021-2025. 
4.  As Georgia marks 30 years of independence, it can take pride in its achievements building 
democratic  institutions.  Governance  standards  reflect  high  aspirations;  the  country’s 
accomplishments in this area have been widely recognized, including in the latest round of 
the World Bank worldwide governance indicators. Yet challenges remain. Georgia shifted to 
a fully parliamentary system of governance in 2019, responding to perceived imbalances in 
the  division  of  power,  but  the  political  scene  remains  turbulent  and  polarised.  Demands 
persist for further reforms of the judicial system, law enforcement and the civil service.  
5.  Georgia has also achieved sturdy economic growth. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 
by 4.9 per cent per year on average in 2010-2019, and GDP per capita rose to $4,764 in 2019 
(from $1,351 in 1991), boosting Georgia to upper-middle-income status. Poverty measured 
by national standards fell to 19.5 per cent in 2019 (from 38.8 per cent in 2007). 
6.  Finding an economic model capable of sustaining rapid growth and delivering widespread 
prosperity has been an ongoing focus since independence. Sweeping market-based reforms 
were  adopted  early  on  to  encourage  foreign  investment  and  stimulate  entrepreneurship. 
Creating a positive business environment has been a long-standing priority, rewarded with a 
seventh-place ranking among 190 countries in the World Bank Doing Business report. Recent 
policies have emphasised social welfare, by establishing a universal health-care system and 
expanding targeted social assistance, which benefits 12.3 per cent of the population.  
7.  Debate continues on how to accelerate economic progress. Although exports grew from 
16 to 54 per cent of GDP between 2000 and 2019, they are not yet competitive enough to lift 
the country to prosperity. The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area established under 
the Association Agreement has yet to reach its full potential. Georgia remains a net importer 
of food, and three-fourths of agricultural exports come from wine, water, spirits and nuts. 
Tourism has been a notable bright spot, soaring to 9.3 million visitors and  $3.3 billion in 
revenues in 2019. Already, the sector accounts for over 8 per cent of GDP and 78 per cent of 
service exports. But the border closures forced by the COVID-19 pandemic have reversed 
this trend, prompting policymakers to seek new opportunities to diversify the economy.  
8.  Pandemic-driven stresses have also evoked fresh concern about groups whose members 
risk missing out on the country’s successes. These include the poor, residents of rural, remote 
and  high-mountain  areas,  inactive  young  people,  women,  persons  with  disabilities, 
minorities,  conflict-affected  communities,  and  people  living  in  areas  prone  to  natural 
disasters. These groups were the focus of the common country analysis that shaped the new

DP/DCP/GEO/4 
 
United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), and the new 
UNDP programme has been designed to reflect the commitment ‘to leave no one behind’. 
9.  Despite a remarkable decline in poverty, one in five Georgians remains poor by national 
standards, and 4.5 per cent meet the $1.9-per-day World Bank definition of extreme poverty.  
10.  Georgia has a pronounced urban-rural divide. A full one-third of the population lives in 
Tbilisi, and the capital acts as a magnet for migration from the villages. At the same time, 
over 40 per cent of Georgians live in rural areas and  depend on farming for a living. Yet 
agriculture  delivers  just  7.2  per  cent  of  GDP.  While  subsistence  farming  can  help  rural 
families weather crises (including the pandemic), this disparity is arguably the single biggest 
constraint  to  economic development  in  Georgia.  Productivity  is  low: an average worker’s 
value-added in agriculture is just one tenth that in industry or services. Most rural dwellers 
are  self-employed  or  unpaid  workers  on  family  farms,  while  more  secure  wage  work  is 
mainly urban. Rural poverty, at 25.5 per cent, is higher than the urban rate, 16.2 per cent. 
11.  At 31 per cent in 2019, Georgia has a very high share of youth aged 15-29 who are not 
in  education,  employment  or  training  (NEET).  The  share  is  far  higher  for  young  women: 
37 per cent versus 25 per cent for men. The cause: an education system that falls short on 
functional literacy and the skills (soft and hard) that would make young people employable. 
12.  Although  equal  rights  are  fully  guaranteed  by  law  and  gender  attitudes  are  shifting2, 
women still face discrimination and inequality in many areas.3 They hold only 14 per cent of 
parliamentary seats and just one of 64 mayoral positions. They face an 18.1 percentage-point 
gap in labour activity rates, owing to the burden of unpaid care work. They earn an average 
wage  that  is  just  64  per  cent  that  for  men  yet  they  have  higher  educational  attainments. 
Occupations are gender-segregated: almost 90 per cent of teachers are women, yet only 12 
per  cent  of  engineering  students  are  female.  One  in  five  women  experiences  sexual 
harassment; one in seven faces violence at the hands of an intimate partner.  
13.  The  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  transgender,  queer,  intersex  (LGBTQI)  community  is 
arguably  the  most  marginalized.  Discrimination  based  on  sexual  orientation  and  gender 
identity is illegal, but LGBTQI persons routinely encounter bias, hate speech and violence.  
14.  Georgia  ratified  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  Persons  with 
Disabilities  in  2014,  but  persons  with  disabilities  still  struggle  for  their  rightful  place  in 
society. Only 3 per cent are registered for disability benefits, whereas global norms suggest 
the actual share of the population with some form of disability must be around 15 per cent. 
Stigma leads families to keep disability hidden, so few children with disabilities attend school 
or  enter  the  labour  force  (only  133 persons  with  disabilities  are  employed  in  the  public 
sector). Disability is still assessed using a medical rather than social model. Physical barriers 
are  widespread,  as  are  disempowering  stereotypes.  A  new  UNDP  survey4  suggests  that 
attitudes are changing, but 43 per cent of the population still believe that assistance for people 
with disabilities is a form of Government charity rather than a state obligation. 
15.  Conflict-affected  communities  face  daunting  challenges  on  both  sides  of  the  dividing 
lines. Georgia has one of the world’s highest displacement rates: 286,216 persons, or 7.7 per 
cent  of  the  population,  are  currently  registered  as  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs). 
Georgian  authorities  have  promoted  integration  into  host  communities,  but  many  IDPs 
remain isolated and dependent on state benefits. Only 45 per cent have received purpose-built

housing,  leaving  thousands  living  in  ‘collective  centres’.  Job  opportunities  and  social 
amenities remain scarce for both IDPs and people living along and across the dividing lines.  
16.  Although laudable progress has been made in adopting international standards, including 
the Paris Climate Agreement, Georgia faces significant environmental challenges. Seismic 
risk is high. With climate change disrupting weather patterns, floods, droughts, landslides 
and mudslides have become more frequent and destructive. Each year $258 million is spent 
on flood recovery. Precipitation  and  temperature  extremes  risk disrupting  the  hydropower 
supply, and other renewables (wind, solar, geothermal) currently amount to just 0.6 per cent 
of the energy balance. Urban air pollution contains high levels of harmful particulates, with 
a measurable negative impact on health. As of 2020, 11 per cent of the national territory has 
been designated as protected areas, but illegal logging and other incursions underline the need 
for better management and more sustainable use of natural resources. 
17.  Improving the well-being of groups at risk of being left behind while working towards 
enduring peace and prosperity for all Georgians is the unifying UNDP vision for 2021-2025. 
The  new  country  programme  was  developed  in  tandem  with  the  UNSDCF  and  directly 
incorporates four of the five joint outcomes. The UNDP theory of change mirrors that of the 
UNSDCF:  it  locates  the  root  causes  of  poverty  and  inequality  in  structural  factors  –  the 
quality of governance institutions, the structure of the economy and the legacy of conflict – 
and proposes structural solutions to address these challenges in a sustainable fashion. 
 
18.  The  new  programme  builds  on  sturdy  foundations.  The  2019  independent  country 
programme  evaluation  (ICPE)  said  UNDP  work  in  2016-2020  was  “highly  relevant  and 
strategically positioned” and called UNDP a “trustworthy and respected strategic partner for 
both  the  Government  and  the  international  community”.5  Achievements  cited  include: 
strengthening  Parliament  and  civil  society;  improving  transparency  and  accountability; 
defining  decentralization  policies;  protecting  human  rights;  furthering  gender  equality; 
advancing rural development; modernizing vocational education; improving social services; 
keeping  communications  open  across  dividing  lines;  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions; 
enhancing flood resistance; building urban resilience; and enlarging protected areas. 
19.  Looking  ahead,  UNDP  aims  to  provide  more  integrated  solutions,  bridging  different 
sectors and applying multiple areas of expertise to address simultaneously the diverse root 
causes of poverty and inequality. As underlined in the ICPE, this integrated approach presents 
particular  promise  at  the  municipal  level,  where  UNDP  efforts  in  local  governance,  rural 
development and disaster risk reduction can combine to generate new synergies.  
 
20.  UNDP  will  continue  to  add  value  by  combining  top-down  policy  advice  from  global 
expert networks with bottom-up solutions pioneered through hands-on implementation. This 
mutually  reinforcing  process  of  blending  policy  and  practice  was  praised  by  the  ICPE  as 
particularly effective when UNDP programming is sustained over multi-year periods (judged 
as the minimum necessary to build on initial pilots and deliver sustainable change). 
 
21.  This multisectoral approach also underpins the UNDP role as ‘integrator’ for Agenda 
2030  within  the  United  Nations  system.  UNDP  will  work  to  create  a  platform  for  other 
organizations to apply specialized policy advice, normative guidance and  tested practices, 
with UNDP anchoring a system-wide effort supporting national partners in promoting and 
measuring progress towards the SDGs. UNDP already partners with other organizations in 
20  per  cent  of  its  programming;  such  collaboration  will  grow  stronger.  Joint  issues-based 
advocacy efforts will complement the quest for shared results under the UNSDCF.  
 
22.  At the same time, UNDP will fulfil its role as the United Nations technical lead agency 
for COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery by helping to interweave different strands of analysis 
and programming into a single cohesive response. It will also provide expertise to contribute 
to the ongoing debate about possible new pathways to prosperity for Georgia.

23.  UNDP  has  already  established  a  reputation  for  innovation  in  Georgia,  working  with 
partners such as the award-winning Public Service Hall to introduce e-services and the city 
of Rustavi to engage citizens directly in addressing post-industrial urban legacies. Building 
on numerous e-initiatives launched in response to COVID-19, UNDP will continue to apply 
‘digital disruption’ to improve governance, bridge distances, increase competitiveness and 
advance social cohesion. The accelerator lab established in 2020 will help ensure that UNDP 
initiatives leverage technology and apply human-centred design and behavioural science.  
 
II.  Programme priorities and partnerships  
24.  The  new  UNDP  country  programme  will  support  national  development  priorities  by 
focusing  on  the  intertwined  goals  of  European  integration  and  sustainable  development, 
relying  on  the  complementarity  of  the  Association  Agreement  with  the  SDGs  to  multiply 
their impact. In tandem, it will help respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by protecting lives 
and livelihoods in the short term and seeking ways to ‘build forward better’ in the long term.  
 
25.  The country programme has roots in the findings of the mainstreaming, acceleration and 
policy  support  (MAPS)  exercise  that  UNDP  led  on  behalf  of  the  United  Nations  system, 
together  with  the Government  Administration,  in 2019.6  This broad  participatory exercise 
yielded  consensus  around  four  high-impact  solutions:  decentralized  development;  human 
rights and equality; investing in youth and rural areas; and green energy and sustainable cities.  
 
26.  Following these analytical signposts and drawing on  all six signature solutions in the 
UNDP Strategic Plan, the new country programme maps out four solution pathways. 
 
A. 
Improving  governance  for  equality  and  justice.  Building  on  years  of  work 
supporting national aspirations to establish model democratic institutions, UNDP will 
focus  on  utilizing  legislative  frameworks  to  deliver  tangible  results  and  translating 
standards and principles adopted in past years into everyday practice. UNDP will: 
 
i.  Continue to assist the Parliament in undertaking its expanded role as the country’s 
core decision-making institution and monitor media during elections;  
 
ii.  Continue to support public administration reform, focused on building a more merit-
based, non-partisan civil service, enhancing whole-of-government policy planning 
and  coordination,  fostering  public participation,  helping  standardize  and  improve 
the  quality  of  public  service  delivery,  advance  e-services  and  mainstream 
transparency and accountability; 
 
iii.  Work  to  realize  the  potential  of  decentralization  to  promote  good  governance, 
improve  public  services  and  enhance  economic  prospects  at  the  local  level, 
particularly in rural, remote and high-mountain areas, and strive to improve social 
cohesion and overcome alienation in areas with a large share of national minorities; 
 
iv.  Assist institutions and civil society in monitoring national compliance with human 
rights standards, while directly supporting  persons with disabilities, the LGBTQI 
community and other at-risk groups, and promote diversity and tolerance as positive 
social values;  
 
v.  Collaborate with other United Nations organizations to advance gender equality in 
three main areas: 
 
a)  Promoting  women’s  political  participation,  particularly  at  local  level, 
where a gender quota applies for the 2021 municipal elections;  
 
6 UNDP (2019) “Accelerating progress towards the SDGs: Identifying priority areas for action in Georgia” 
(https://www.ge.undp.org/content/georgia/en/home/library/MAPS.html). 
20-16384 
5/19 
 
DP/DCP/GEO/4 
 
 
b)  Seeking  to  expand  women’s  opportunities  for  skills  development  and 
employment and reduce the gender wage gap; and 
c)  Building the foundations of a care economy, demonstrating that public 
spending on care services is an investment with a triple payoff: new jobs 
for  women,  improved  care for  vulnerable  persons,  and relief  from  the 
unpaid care work that so often hinders women’s employment; and  
 
vi.  Contribute to judicial reform and rule of law and expand access to justice by making 
mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution more readily available.  
 
B.  Safeguarding a green, clean and climate-resilient environment. UNDP will continue 
to  assist  in  providing  policy  advice,  legislative  support  and  practical  work  to  help 
Georgia fulfil its commitments on climate change and reduce carbon emissions across 
all sectors. It will work with central and local partners to improve the management and 
financial  sustainability  of  protected  areas  and  promote  renewable  technologies  and 
energy-efficient  solutions.  UNDP  will  support  sustainable  consumption,  building  on 
European Union-backed concepts such as the circular economy and extended producer 
responsibility. The core focus of environmental work will be a seven-year, $74 million 
programme to prevent floods and other forms of climate-driven disasters across all the 
regions of the country. Measures to climate-proof Georgia will include completing risk-
and-hazard mapping of all 11 major river basins, establishing a nationwide multi-hazard 
early  warning  system,  constructing  nature-based  protective  solutions  for  at  least  100 
high-risk locations, and building climate resilience at the community level.  
 
C.  Unlocking the potential of rural areas. UNDP will take a two-pronged approach to 
bridging the urban-rural divide: helping rural communities use the legal framework for 
decentralization  to  improve  socioeconomic  prospects  while  professionalizing  farming 
and improving agricultural productivity. Reform of the vocational training system will 
aim to provide rural youth with the technical, digital and soft skills needed to thrive in 
the private sector. Diversification of the rural economic landscape will continue, both by 
promoting  non-farm  livelihoods  and  building  municipal  capacity  to  plan  and  manage 
local economic development from the bottom up. Private-sector competitiveness will be 
improved  by  applying  approaches  such  as  value-chain  strengthening  and  clustering. 
Digitalization  will  be  promoted  as  a  way  of  saving  rural  jobs  and  overcoming  the 
isolation  of  village  life.  Taken  together,  these  efforts  will  reduce  poverty  by  creating 
rural jobs and slow emigration by enhancing the attractiveness of life outside Tbilisi.  
 
D.  Improving  living  conditions  for  conflict-affected  people.  To  create  an  enabling 
environment  for  sustainable  peace  and  reconciliation  between  divided  communities, 
UNDP will work to  enhance confidence building, strengthen civil society in conflict-
affected  areas,  and  improve people-to-people  contacts  across dividing  lines.  Provided 
that  access  remains  feasible,  UNDP  will  continue  to  work  in  Abkhazia,  Georgia  to 
enhance  the  quality  of  social  services  and  help  local  communities  improve  living 
conditions, including in mitigating the pandemic’s socioeconomic impact on vulnerable 
groups. UNDP will also work to reduce flood risks and seek to improve environmental 
protection (for example, in waste management and nature protection). UNDP will also 
support  IDP  communities  and  vulnerable  people  living  along  dividing  lines,  with  a 
particular emphasis on promoting economic self-sufficiency for women. Activities will 
expand to the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, Georgia if conditions allow. 
 
27.  To  achieve  these  aims,  UNDP  will  seek  to  work  with  both  traditional  development 
partners and less conventional actors, in an effort to secure resources for the programme and 
also help Georgia generate sufficient funding to speed its progress towards the SDGs. Active 
participation in coordination mechanisms will help ensure that UNDP remains focused on 
those areas where it can best deliver results, promote coherence and ensure sustainability, 
while respecting the expertise and competence of actors specialized for work in other fields.

III.  Programme and risk management  
28.  Making this vision a reality requires mastering pandemic risks. Thanks to the flexibility 
of partners and donors, UNDP has managed to reorient programming swiftly to face COVID-
19 challenges. Given the pandemic’s unknown trajectory and the increasingly volatile impact 
of climate change, UNDP will strive to make agility and adaptability its hallmarks.  
 
29.  The  national  economy  has  held  up  well  in  the  face  of  pandemic  stresses,  with  GDP 
forecast to rebound in 2021 after a decline of 6 per cent in 2020. This resilience owes much 
to support from multilateral financial institutions, which have already dedicated $3 billion to 
help protect businesses and households. But if COVID-19 consequences disrupt economic 
recovery or reconfigure national priorities, UNDP is prepared to reorient its programme.  
 
30.  UNDP  is  likely  to  face  continued  constraints  in  operating  in  conflict-affected  areas. 
Transparency and strict adherence to humanitarian principles will help mitigate this risk.  
 
31.  The country programme document outlines UNDP contributions to national results and 
serves as the primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board for results alignment and 
resources assigned to the programme at country level. Accountabilities of managers at the 
country, regional and headquarter levels with respect to country programmes are prescribed 
in the organization’s programme and operations policies and procedures and internal control 
framework. 
 
32.  The  programme  will  be  nationally  executed.  If  necessary,  national  execution  may  be 
replaced  by  direct  execution  for  part  or  all  of  the  programme  to  enable  response  to  force 
majeure. The harmonized approach to cash transfers will be used in a coordinated fashion 
with  other  United  Nations  entities  to  manage  financial  risks.  Cost  definitions  and 
classifications  for  programme  and  development  effectiveness  will  be  charged  to  the 
concerned projects. 
 
IV.  Monitoring and evaluation 
33.  Development  progress  will  be  monitored  against  the  indicators  in  the  results  and 
resources framework, which incorporates nationalized SDG indicators and is aligned with the 
UNSCDF. To measure its contribution to national results, UNDP will employ the national 
SDG tracker and other national monitoring systems, official statistical data and reports from 
line ministries, development partners and research institutions. Perception surveys and other 
innovative  tools  will  be  used  to  assess  results  and  behavioural  change.  The  National 
Statistical Office and other partners will receive support to improve data quality. 
34.  UNDP  will  strengthen  its  internal  capacity  while  helping  external  partners  develop 
monitoring  and  evaluation  skills.  It  will  collaborate  with  other  United  Nations  entities  to 
monitor progress towards UNSDCF results. Independent evaluations will be commissioned 
to assess UNDP contributions to transformative change. Spending devoted to gender equality 
will be tracked and exceed 15 per cent of total expenditure. Evaluation findings will be shared 
with Government and civil society counterparts, development partners and the public.
