Programme rationale  
1. 
Children  living  in  Lebanon  find  themselves  at  a  precarious  juncture  after  a 
series  of  shocks,  including  economic  collapse,  political  instability,  the  coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the devastating explosions at the Port 
of Beirut in August 2020, which caused losses of more than $4.6 billion.1 The national 
gross domestic product plummeted from $52 billion in 2019 to $22 billion in 2021.2 
The country is now classified as “lower-middle income” after 27 years as part of the 
upper-middle-income  group. 3  Currency  devaluation  contributed  to  hyperinflation, 
forecast at 181 per cent in 2022.4 The availability and quality of social services has 
substantially deteriorated. International support, including a $3 billion package from 
the International Monetary Fund, is contingent on Lebanon implementing key reforms 
required for a sustainable recovery.  
2. 
Children,  people  with  disabilities,  girls  and  women  are  among  those  most 
affected by  these  crises.  Hard-won  progress in  the  realization  of  their  rights is  being 
rapidly reversed. While no recent national data on poverty are available, models suggest 
that  the  proportion  of  the  population  living  in  multidimensional  poverty  may  have 
doubled from 39 per cent in 2019 to 81 per cent in 2021, affecting 1.8 million children.5 
Social protection interventions are limited in coverage and benefits,  with just 6.5 per 
cent  of  the  Lebanese  population  receiving  any  type  of  non-contributory  transfer,6 
exacerbating deprivations. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with  Disabilities,  expected  to  be  ratified  soon  in  Lebanon,  will  provide  a  basis  for 
strengthening the national legal framework. Lebanon ranks ninety-sixth on the gender 
inequality  index.  Few  data  sources  provide  gendered  analysis,  particularly  for 
younger populations. 
3. 
In  addition  to  Palestinian  refugees,  some  1.5  million  Syrian  refugees  live  in 
Lebanon.7 Refugees are among the most vulnerable groups, with an estimated 90 per 
cent of refugee families living in extreme poverty, a substantial increase from 55 per 
cent in 2020.8  
4. 
The  national  health  system  is  fragmented,  and  80  per  cent  of  hospitals  are 
privately owned. Primary health care is not prioritized: 71 per cent of state funding is 
allocated to secondary and tertiary care.9 The national health system has been heavily 
impacted by the crises and faces major financial and operational challenges. Forty per 
cent of doctors have left the country,10 including specialists in maternal and newborn

three doses of the diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) vaccine.11 
5. 
Lebanon  is  experiencing  a  growing  triple  burden  of  malnutrition  (stunting, 
micronutrient  deficiencies,  and  obesity)  among  children  and  adolescents  and  high 
rates of undernutrition among women. The prevalence of stunting for children aged 
6–59  months  is  7  per  cent  nationally,12  compared  with  25  per  cent  among  Syrian 
refugees in informal settlements,13 an increase from 17 per cent in 2013.14 In camps 
hosting Palestinian populations, the prevalence of acute malnutrition among  children 
under  5  years  of  age  is  4  per  cent,  compared  with  1.8  per  cent  among  Lebanese 
children.15 Acute malnutrition among pregnant and lactating women is also highest in 
Palestinian  camps  (9.5  per  cent)  and  among  Syrian  refugees  in  settlements  (8  per 
cent). More than 40 per cent of women  of reproductive age and children aged 6–59 
months have anaemia. A study of children 12–18 years old found a higher prevalence 
of  overweight  and  obesity  among  boys  (31.1  per  cent)  compared  to  20.9  per  cent 
among girls.16 Some 94 per cent of children 6–23 months old are not fed the minimum 
diet  they  need  to  grow  and  develop  healthily,  and  70  per  cent  of  children  under  6 
months of age are not exclusively breastfed.17  
6. 
Access to safely managed water and sanitation remains low, at 48 per cent and 
16  per  cent,  respectively,  in  2020.18  Recent  progress  is  being  reversed  due  to  the 
reduced capacity of establishments responsible for water and wastewater systems. In 
2017, the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended improving access to 
water  and  sanitation  for  disadvantaged  communities.  Residents  of  informal 
settlements  remain  largely  dependent  on  humanitarian  agencies  for  access  to  water 
and  sanitation.  The  impact  of  climate  change  poses  increasing  challenges;  annual 
precipitation is forecast to decrease by 25 per cent by the end of the century.19  
7. 
Twenty-two  per  cent  of  the  school-age  population  in  Lebanon  were  not  in 
school  in  2021,20 while  the  percentage  of  out-of-school  Syrian  children  aged  3‒18 
years  rose  from  55  per  cent  to  63  per  cent  between  2020  and  2021.  The  severe 
economic crisis makes it difficult for the most marginalized children to afford basic 
costs including transportation to get to school. The lack of  good quality provision at 
pre-primary level as well as violence in schools, including corporal punishment, are 
also key constraints.  
8. 
Only very limited public services are available to address the needs of children 
with disabilities, who face challenges integrating at school. The quality of education

is declining due to deteriorating learning environments and outdated curricula.21 The 
economic crisis has had a negative impact on teachers’ salaries and led to a reliance 
across  the  public  education  system  on  less-qualified  substitute  teachers.  Overall, 
teachers in the public formal school system lack an adequate knowledge of modern 
pedagogy,  especially  related  to  building  foundational  literacy,  numeracy  and 
transferable skills, including digital literacy.  
9. 
The  recent  crisis  has  heightened  protection  risks  for  children  and  women, 
including those of violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, gender-based violence and 
harmful practices. During 2021, the share of children aged 5–17 years who were sent 
to work more than doubled, from 5 per cent to 12 per cent. In early 2022, the rate was 
at 9 per cent.22 A recent survey shows that 8.4 per cent of girls aged 15–19 years were 
married at the time of the survey.23 One in four young people reported often feeling 
depressed.24 At least 20,000 children live in residential homes, and institutionalization 
is likely to increase as families struggle with deteriorating economic conditions.25  
10.  Twenty-nine per cent of adolescents and youth aged 15‒24 years are neither in 
school,  in  training  nor  employed. 26  Outdated  curricula 27  contribute  to  a  limited 
acquisition  of  market-relevant  and  future-oriented  skills.  Unemployment  among 
youth aged 15‒24 years has risen from 23 per cent in 2019 to 48 per cent in 2022.28 
Young people and adolescents also lack adequate opportunities for participation and 
engagement on issues that affect their lives at home,  at school, in their communities 
and nationally. Their participation is constrained by negative social and gender norms, 
as well as a limited number of safe spaces. Mental health issues are rising and more 
than half of young people and adolescents  reported that their lives had worsened  in 
the past year.29 Mental health services are either unavailable or unaffordable.  
11.  The current country programme benefits from lessons learned from the previous 
one,  including  two  recommendations  concerning  the  need  for  UNICEF  to  achieve 
long-term results while adapting to a rapidly changing environment and  to continue 
efforts  to  build  the  capacity  of  subnational  government  institutions  to  deliver  and 
monitor results.  
Programme priorities and partnerships 
12.  The  programme’s  main  aim  is  supporting  the  country  to  address  the  rapidly 
deteriorating situation and  the increasing vulnerability of  all children, and which is 
reversing earlier gains in development outcomes for children and young people. The 
programme also maintains a longer-term perspective supporting national institutions 
and  other  duty-bearers  to  build  a  more  sustainable  future  in  which  they  are 
increasingly able to meet their commitments to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of 
all children and young people in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child

and  other  national  and  international  obligations.  The  present  CPD  complements 
UNICEF humanitarian interventions as outlined in the 2022 Lebanon Crisis Response 
Plan and Lebanon Emergency Response Plan.30 
13.  The programme contributes to  the UNICEF Strategic Plan, 2022–2025 and is 
derived  from  the  national  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Cooperation 
Framework (UNSDCF). Programme priorities were selected on the basis of balancing 
humanitarian and development interventions, while also aligning with the priorities 
of  relevant  national  policies  and  plans  and  maximizing  UNICEF’s  comparative 
advantage and synergies within the UNSDCF. The programme was further guided by 
consultations  with  national  counterparts,  United  Nations  agencies,  major 
development partners and young people.  
14.  The programme will sharpen its focus on decreasing equity gaps for the most 
vulnerable children living in Lebanon. UNICEF will focus on promoting capacities, 
funding  and  support  for  policies  and  programmes  that  tackle  geographic  and  other 
disparities. It will enhance partnerships with local institutions and strengthen capacity 
to deliver services, focusing on the most vulnerable. Evidence-based advocacy will 
be prioritized to leverage resources and commitments for children, including in the 
state  budget,  and  to  build  public-private  partnerships  that  rally  support  for  child 
rights. 
15.  The programme is based on the theory that if: 
(a)  The most vulnerable boys, girls and women demand, have access to and 
can afford integrated, quality health and nutrition services; 
(b)  The  most  marginalized  boys  and  girls  have  access  to  good  quality  and 
inclusive learning, which prepares them for life, including work; 
(c)  Girls, boys and women increasingly live a safe, dignified and empowered 
life,  protected  from  violence,  abuse,  neglect,  exploitation,  harmful  practices  and 
gender-based violence; 
(d)  Children and youth have adequate quantities of clean and safe water and 
safely managed sanitation, and enjoy a sustainable clean and safe environment ; 
(e)  Young  people,  especially  the  most  vulnerable,  have  increased  access  to 
learning,  decent  income-generating  and  civic  engagement  opportunities  to  enable 
them to successfully transition from learning to earning while improving their well-
being; and 
(f)  The rise in multidimensional poverty and vulnerability of girls, boys and 
youth  is  slowed  through  more  progressive  policies,  supported  by  improved  social 
sector allocation, accountability and social protection, 
then, children and young people, especially the most disadvantaged, will have their 
rights  increasingly  respected,  protected  and  fulfilled  and  will  develop  to  their  full 
potential in an inclusive and healthy society. 
16.  The main underlying assumption is that the Government will take the necessary 
action  to  address  the  current  crisis,  thus  preventing  the  further  deterioration  of  the 
economic and social situation. 
17.  The country programme will have the following components:  
Survive and thrive 
18.  This  component,  developed  with  the  Ministry  of  Public  Health  and  partners, 
aims to improve the access, quality and equity of health, nutrition and early childhood

development  (ECD) services,  and  to  enhance positive health-seeking behaviours. It 
contributes to the achievement of UNSDCF Goal 1, Outcomes 1 and 2.  
19.  UNICEF  will  support  the  delivery  of  accessible,  affordable,  climate-resilient 
and gender-responsive maternal, neonatal, child and adolescent health, nutrition and 
ECD services by strengthening primary health care and other delivery systems. It will 
improve vaccine logistics and cold chain management  (including through the use of 
renewable  energy)  and  will  utilize  immunization  as  an  entry  point  for  offering 
integrated  health  and  nutrition  interventions  for  the  most  vulnerable  children.  The 
programme will focus on  antenatal and preventive care for mothers and  children. It 
will  also  focus  on,  with  the  World  Health  Organization,  the  integration  of  mental 
health  and  psychosocial  support  into  primary  health  care  and  community-based 
outreach  and  midwifery  services.  UNICEF  will  also  work  with  multiple  sectors  to 
deliver services for prevention, early detection, referral and management of all forms 
of malnutrition and developmental delays. 
20.  UNICEF will support communities to demand  good quality health services. It 
will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  community  health  workers  to  promote  health y 
behaviours and tackle barriers faced by adolescent girls. Community engagement will 
bring  services  closer  to  communities  and  reduce  financial  barriers.  UNICEF  will 
protect and promote  adequate diets,  practices and nutrition and ECD services. This 
will be done by strengthening evidence-informed social behaviour-change strategies 
and community-based solutions. 
21.  This component will strengthen capacity across multiple sectors and systems by 
generating evidence, supporting policies, legislation and community-based solutions 
and services,  to protect, promote and support adequate diets,  feeding and nurturing 
care  practices,  and  essential  services  for  children  to  grow  and  develop  to  their  full 
potential and to prevent all forms of malnutrition. UNICEF will also support national 
efforts  to  reform  health  and  nutrition  financing,  the  strengthening  of  supply  chains 
through  digital  solutions,  and  the  establishment  of  a  maternal  and  perinatal  death 
surveillance system.  
Learning and skills 
22.  This component contributes to the achievement of UNSDCF Goal 1, Outcome 2 
by supporting the Ministry of Education and Higher Education and partners to ensure  
that  the  most  marginalized  boys  and  girls  aged  3‒18  years  have  access  to  good -
quality,  gender-responsive  and  inclusive  learning,  in  close  alignment  with  the 
Lebanon  Five-Year  General  Education  Plan  2021–2025.  To  increase  access  to 
education,  UNICEF  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Higher  Education  jointly 
established  the  Transition  Resilience  Education  Fund,  which  will  include  the 
following:  
(a)  Provide  financial  support  for  marginalized  children  and  funds  to  enable 
schools to provide a safe and inclusive environment; 
(b) 
Identify and tackle the barriers and needs of adolescent girls; 
(c)  Construct and rehabilitate schools; 
(d)  Ensure  the  climate  resilience  of  infrastructure  and  the  presence  of  basic 
facilities.  
The programme will also: 
(e) 
Improve  the  accessibility  of  public  schools  and  availability  of  learning 
materials for children with disabilities; 
6/17 
22-28306 
 
E/ICEF/2023/P/L.10 
 
 
(f) 
Increase  access  by  out-of-school  children  to  education  and  multiple 
flexible learning pathways;  
(g)  Seek  to  overcome  barriers  limiting  the  access  of  refugee  children  to 
education and accelerate delivery of gender-responsive pedagogy; 
(h) 
teachers.  
Improve school connectivity and build digital literacy among children and 
This  component  will  build  teachers’  knowledge  and  capacity  to  deliver  learning 
recovery and catch-up programmes to build the foundational literacy, numeracy and 
transferable skills of children and adolescents, in partnership with the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. 
23.  To increase demand for quality and inclusive education, UNICEF will provide 
incentives  to  attract  and  retain  children  in  learning  and  to  strengthen  positive 
parenting and parent-child relationships.  
To strengthen the education system, UNICEF will: 
(a)  Support education reform focused on equity, quality and inclusion; 
(b)  Define  procedures  for  accreditation,  certification  and  validation  of 
learning achievements against national curriculum benchmarks; 
(c)  Support teaching and learning practices consistent with active learning ; 
(d)  Promote practices that strengthen formal and non-formal education. 
24.  UNICEF  will  support  national  authorities  to  develop  policy  frameworks  and 
procedures  designed  to  integrate  out-of-school  children  and  strengthen  inclusive 
information management systems. 
Protection from violence, exploitation, abuse, neglect and harmful practices 
25.  This  component  will  contribute  to  UNSDCF  Goal  1,  Outcomes  1,  2  and  3.  It 
will also support national efforts to develop a stronger child rights governance system, 
mobilizing actors to commit to a call to action for children, and strengthen inclusive 
systems  for preventing  and responding to child protection violations ‒ including  in 
humanitarian contexts. UNICEF will work with the relevant ministries and parliament 
to  address  gaps  in  the  legal  and  policy  framework,  including  efforts  to  strengthen 
child-friendly justice and birth registration systems in Lebanon. UNICEF will support 
advocacy to increase domestic financing of child protection services. 
26.  UNICEF  will  focus  on  prevention  and  early  intervention  strategies,  support 
efforts to address child marriage, school violence, child labour, harmful social norms 
around gender and disability through community mobilization, cross-sectoral referral 
mechanisms and services; and roll out positive parenting programmes. It will support 
the Ministry of Public Health, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education and 
the Ministry of Social Affairs to roll out the national mental health and psychosocial 
support  strategy  for  children  through  the  provision  of  cross-sectoral  services. 
UNICEF will also monitor the well-being of women and at-risk children and survivors 
of violence, including children involved in armed conflict, through community -based 
mechanisms, and will ensure their access to specialized services. This component will 
strengthen the social welfare workforce, including support for the reporting on grave 
violations against children through the integrated case and information management 
system.

Water, sanitation and hygiene, climate and environment 
27.  This  component  contributes  to  the  achievement  of  the  UNSDCF  Goal  1, 
Outcome 2 and Goal 4, Outcome 1 by supporting the national water sector recovery 
plan  and  preventing  the  further  deterioration  of  water  supply  and  wastewater 
treatment services. UNICEF will support the operation and maintenance of water and 
wastewater treatment facilities to ensure the continuity of the water supply and reduce 
the  discharge  of  raw  sewage  into  the  environment.  UNICEF  will  support 
improvements  to  water  supply  infrastructure,  through  the  construction  of  spring 
catchments  and  reservoirs  for  gravity-flow  systems  and  the  conversion  of  pumping 
stations to renewable energy. Public water points providing a regulated supply will be 
promoted.  UNICEF  will  improve  the  cost-efficiency  of  providing  water  and 
wastewater  services  in  informal  settlements  while  protecting  the  environment  and 
ensuring that vulnerable populations continue to have full access to services.  
28.  UNICEF will increase its emphasis on community involvement and stakeholder 
engagement  in  local  management  of  water  and  wastewater  services,  increasing 
accountability and decreasing the potential for conflict. Social and behaviour-change 
and community engagement will enhance the capacity of marginalized communities 
to  access  and  demand  water,  sanitation  and  hygiene  (WASH)  services.  Innovative 
management models enhancing the role of municipalities will be scaled up. Women, 
girls and young people will be supported to play a greater role in managing services, 
including initiatives addressing water scarcity and climate change. 
29.  UNICEF will work with  Government partners such as the Ministry  of Energy 
and Water and the Ministry of Environment to improve the country's water resource 
management, including reducing non-revenue water (which does not produce income 
because of leaks or illegal connections) and wastewater discharges. UNICEF will also 
support the capacity of the Ministry of Environment to conduct environmental impact 
assessments and monitor wastewater treatment plant discharges.  
Adolescents and youth  
30.  This  component  will  support  young  people  with  second-chance  education, 
supporting  youth  to  acquire  gender-transformative  skills  and  provide  them  with 
increased  access  to  decent  income-generating  and  civic  engagement  opportunities, 
thus  enabling  them  to  successfully  transition  from  learning  to  earning  while 
improving their well-being. 
31.  UNICEF will work with national institutions  and, UN agencies  to support the 
implementation of the 2022–2024 National Youth Policy Action Plan and the National 
Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Strategic Framework. Both the 
action plan and the strategic framework aim to foster policies that support education, 
economic and social empowerment and meaningful participation for adolescents and 
young girls and boys aged 15‒24 years, especially the most vulnerable.  
32.  UNICEF, with the International Labour Organization (ILO), will increase access 
for  young  people  to  inclusive  foundational,  transferable  and  twenty-first  century 
skills,  linking  to  green jobs  and  improving  access  to  workplace-based  learning  and 
entrepreneurial opportunities by:  
(a)  Fostering private sector engagement; 
(b)  Advancing girls’ employment; 
(c)  Mainstreaming  life  skills,  mental  health  and  participation  in  schools, 
community centres and workplaces.  
8/17

E/ICEF/2023/P/L.10 
 
 
UNICEF will also increase the engagement of young people in emergency response, 
disaster risk reduction and risk communication and community engagement. 
33.  This component will empower vulnerable children, adolescents and youth aged 
10–24  years  to  meaningfully  participate  socially  and  civically  on  issues  that  affect 
their well-being. Social and behaviour-change interventions will be prioritized, as will 
advocacy  to  support  young  people’s  priorities,  such  as  civic  engagement,  mental 
health and climate change.  
Inclusive social policy and social protection 
34.  This component supports national efforts to address the rise in multidimensional 
poverty  and  vulnerability  of  children  and  young  people  through  more  progressive, 
gender-responsive  and  disability-inclusive  policymaking,  supported  by  improved 
social  sector  budgets  and  spending,  accountability  and  shock-responsive  social 
protection for vulnerable groups. This component contributes to the UNSDCF Goal 
1, Outcome 1. 
35.  UNICEF will collaborate with partners to  conduct policy and budget analyses 
and  advocate  on  ‘high-value’  policy  and  resource  issues  that  are  child-focused  and 
crisis-relevant,  including  social  protection,  taxation,  health,  education,  water  and 
sanitation, climate, nutrition, child protection and local governance. It will promote 
transparency with regard to national resources and rights, to enhance inclusion by and 
accountability of basic services. 
36.  UNICEF will engage a wide range of audiences through multiple channels and 
generate analysis, advocacy and a national dialogue on child poverty and the impact 
of crises. These efforts will build on the launch of a national child poverty advocacy 
plan, using a gender and disability lens.  
37.  With  the  ILO,  the  programme  will  support  the  Ministry  of  Social Affairs  and 
other bodies to strengthen social protection ‒ including through  the implementation 
of the new national social protection strategy ‒ and support the development of system 
components,  including  data  systems,  referrals  and  linkages  with  social  services. 
UNICEF  will  promote  social  protection  that  is  shock-responsive  and  tailored  to 
address gender barriers, leveraging resources with partners including the World Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund. Building on the existing emergency child grant, 
UNICEF  will  support  the  establishment  of  national  social  grants,  and  a  national 
disability allowance. 
Programme effectiveness 
38.  This component will provide cross-cutting support to all programmes and ensure 
that country programme planning, monitoring, evaluation, financing and management 
meet  quality  standards.  It  also  includes  overall  UNICEF  coordination  in  social  and 
behaviour-change  communication  to  ensure  that  communities  know  about  child 
rights,  practise  positive  behaviours  and  demand  essential  services.  The  component 
also  includes  external  communication,  advocacy  and  partnerships  to  support 
UNICEF.  It  will  seek  to  ensure  coordination  of  UNICEF  engagement  in  key  cross-
sectoral  issues,  including  climate  change,  ECD,  disability,  gender,  GBV  and  the 
prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse.  
39.  Lastly,  this  outcome  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local  actors  to  identify 
vulnerable  children  and  communities,  engage  in  disaster  risk  reduction  and 
emergency preparedness and response, and demand equitable access to services.

(a) The requirement for other resources (emergency) is estimated at $636 million. 
Programme and risk management 
40.  This country programme document outlines UNICEF contributions to national 
results  and  serves  as  the  primary  unit  of  accountability  to  the  Executive  Board  for 
results  alignment  and  resources  assigned  to  the  programme  at  the  country  level. 
Accountabilities  of  managers  at  the  country,  regional  and  headquarters  levels  with 
respect to country programmes are prescribed in the organization’s programme and 
operations policies and procedures.  
41.  The Prime Minister’s office coordinates overall implementation of the country 
programme.  A  steering  committee,  including  representatives  of  the  Government, 
United  Nations  and  other  partners,  provides  oversight  to  the  UNSDCF. The  United 
Nations  Country Team  is  the  main  mechanism  for  inter-agency  coordination,  while 
the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan, led by the  Government, the Office of the United 
Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  and  the  United  Nations  Development 
Programme, oversees the humanitarian response.  
42.  Risk-control  and  mitigation  measures  will  be  based  on  analyses  of  risks  and 
vulnerabilities.  UNICEF  has  taken  measures  to  mitigate  the  risks  related  to  the 
country’s fragile economy and the devaluation of its currency, by using cash to pay 
beneficiaries  and  civil  servants  directly.  UNICEF  will  assess  the  opportunities  and 
risks related to expanding this scheme. UNICEF will seek to mitigate risks posed by 
the nationwide scale of the programme by  establishing an internal coordination unit 
to support the large number of direct payments for services. This will increase value 
for  money  with  a  system  of  third-party  monitoring,  grievance  and  redress 
mechanisms, spot-checks and a robust monitoring and reporting  structure, including 
reinforcement  of  the  prevention  of  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  and  anti-fraud 
activities.  
43.  Financial and non-financial resources will be mobilized to mitigate the risk of 
insufficient  funding.  This  will  include  widening  the  pool  of  existing  donors  and 
substantially increasing engagement with the private sector.  
10/17

E/ICEF/2023/P/L.10 
 
 
44.  UNICEF  has  improved  its  ability  to  collect  feedback  as  part  of  the  overall 
strategy  of  ensuring  accountability  to  affected  populations.  A  national  hotline  will 
also be set up to manage information requests and share information about UNICEF 
programmes with affected populations.  
Monitoring, learning and evaluation 
45.  UNICEF,  with  other  agencies,  will  support  the  ability  of  the  Government  to 
generate data and evidence to inform programmes, advocacy, policies and budgeting 
for children. It will also enhance the capacity of the Government to report progress 
on the Sustainable Development Goals by helping to it carry out household surveys, 
such as the  Multiple  Indicator Cluster  Survey, and providing data  disaggregated by 
sex, age, location, migratory and disability status. 
46. 
In  UNICEF  workplans,  results  indicator  disaggregation  by  gender,  age, 
disability, nationality, geography, etc. will be improved. Progress towards programme 
results  will  be  assessed  through  annual  reviews  with  the  Government  and  partners, 
contributing  to  UNSDCF  reviews.  Programme  implementation  will  be  monitored 
through  regular  field  visits  with  partners  and  by  systematic  third-party  monitoring. 
The monitoring of humanitarian performance will be used to ensure a clear alignment 
of results with the UNICEF Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action. 
UNICEF  will  conduct  evaluations  to  learn  and  adapt  programmes  and  ensure 
accountability to stakeholders, while strengthening national evaluation systems. 
47.  Throughout  the  programme  implementation  period,  UNICEF  will  support  the 
Government and non-governmental partners reporting to the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child and other human rights bodies, based on the country’s reporting calendar.
