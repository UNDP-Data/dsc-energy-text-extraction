I.  Programme rationale 
1.  Brazil  experienced  a  decade  of  economic  and  social  progress  from  2002 -2014  in 
which  over  26  million  people  were  lifted  out  of  poverty  and  inequality  was  reduced 
significantly (the  Gini  Coefficient  fell  from  0.60 to  0.53) .1 The  income of the bottom 
40 per cent of the population grew an average 6.1 per cent (in real terms), compared to 
the  3.5  per  cent  income  growth  for  the  total  population.  Between  2003  and  2014, 
conditional  cash  transfer  policies,  like  Bolsa  Familia,  Green  Grant  and  Family 
the 
Agriculture  Credit,  contributed 
international poverty line ($ 1.25/day) from 12.7 per cent to 4.9 per cent.   
the  population 
living  below 
to  reducing 
2. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Brazil dropped from 4.5 per cent in 2006-2010 to 
2.1 per cent over 2011-2014, plunging to -3.8 per cent in 2015. Inflation remains high, 
ending  2015  at  10.8  per  cent.  In  2015,  Brazilian  Real  depreciated  by  49  per  cent 
compared to the United States Dollar. 
3.  Although  inequality  has  decreased  during  past  decade,  poverty  persists  among 
vulnerable populations, especially  Northeast rural  poor, indigenous, agro -extractivists 
and African  descents. The  structural  cause  is  concentration  of  political  and  economic 
wealth in the top 5 per cent 2 of the population that led to unequal access to rights and 
public  services.  In  the  Northeast,  poverty  and  extreme  poverty  declined  more  than  in 
the  rest  of  Brazil,  but  the  region  still  lags  behind  the  rest  of  the  country.  Poverty 
among  agricultural  households  fell  from  65  per  cent  to  36  per  cent,  but  many  people 
still live in poverty.3 African descent households (53 per cent of the population)4 have 
a per-capita income 40 per cent lower than non-African descent.5  
4. Regarding Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Brazil surpassed all targets in 
seven MDGs, and improved  MDG 4: maternal mortality rate. While the country target 
was 35 cases per 100,000 live births there is still an average of 63.9 deaths,6 of which 
62.8 per cent were Afro-Brazilian women and 34 per cent white women. Respectively, 
they  represent  52  per  cent  and  47.5  per  cent  of  Brazilian  female  population.  Infant 
mortality rates  among  indigenous  children  are  43.4  per 1,000  live  births  compared to 
15  per  1,000  live  births  among  non-indigenous  children,  mostly  due  to  diarrhoea  and  
malnutrition.7   
5. In  Brazil, the  status of  women  has  been  improving  over the last decades;  however, 
social  markers related to race, ethnicity and class are sources of inequalities faced by 
African  decent,  indigenous  and  rural  women.  For  example,  homicide  rates  against 
African  descent  women  are  48  per  cent  higher  that  against  non-afro  women8,  while 
32.7  per  cent9  of  indigenous  women  have  anemia  due  to  inadequate  management  of 
indigenous  lands,  lack  of  access  to  seeds  and  health  services.10  Hence,  inequalities 
based on region, gender, race and ethnicity discrimination are still structuring and are 
the main development challenge for the country.   
6. More than 80 per cent of the population lives in urban areas, which affects land use, 
local  and  natural  resources, 
household  composition,  and  places  pressure  on

establishing  different  access  to  urban  benefits.  Mobilization  from  rural  to  urban 
continuous  increasing  the  number  of  irregular  occupations  with  lack  of  public 
services, worsening the concentration of poverty in urban areas.  
7.  Brazil’s  current  mitigation  actions  in  the  global  effort  represent  one  of  the  largest 
undertakings by any single country to date, having reduced its greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions  by  41  per  cent11  in  2012  in  relation  to  2005  levels.  Brazil  reduced 
deforestation  rate  in  Amazon  by  82  per  cent  between  2004  and  2014,  and  has 
undertaken  mitigation  actions  in  many  areas,  including  energy  and  agriculture.  The 
recent  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (INDCs)  presented  by  Brazil  in 
the context of the  COP21,  has indicated  that  the country  further intends  to  commit to 
reduce GHG emissions by 37 per cent below 2005 levels in 2025, and by 43 per cent 
in 2030.  
8.  Brazil  experiences  continuous  increase  of  natural  disasters.  The  Brazilian Atlas  of 
Natural  Disasters  mapped  an  average  of  1.363  catastrophes  per  year,  which  affected 
more  than  1,500  municipalities.  Droughts,  floods  and  landslides  killed  2,500  people 
between 1991 and 2010. Poor African Brazilian populations living in  favelas are most 
affected by disasters. 
9.  Brazil  faces  several  development  challenges  when  it  comes  to  combining 
agricultural  growth,  environmental  protection,  rights  of  indigenous  populations  and 
sustainable development. The 2010 Census determined there are 896,000 people (from 
305  indigenous  ethnicities  and  274  spoken  languages)  living  in  protected  areas  but 
face threats from farmers, loggers and illegal mining.  
10.  Alagoas,  Bahia  and  Ceará  are  the  most  violent  states  in  Brazil.  Over  the  past 
decade,  homicides  rate  has  increased,  reaching  29  per  100,000  inhabitants.  In  2012, 
56,337  people  were  killed  nationwide,  of  which  30,072  were  poor  young  men   of 
African  descent.  The  number  of  white  victims  decreased  from  20,000  in  2002  to 
15,000 in 2012 while the number of African descent victims i ncreased from 30,000 to 
41,000,  during  in  the  same  period,12  an  evidence  of  racial  inequality  in  Brazil.    With 
regards  to  gender-based  violence,  relatives  committed  50.3  per  cent  of  the  4,762 
registered homicides against women. In addition, there has been a  54 per cent increase 
in the number of murdered African Brazilian women over the past decade .13 
11.  Brazil  has  experienced  important  advances  in  access  to  Justice,  such  as  the 
strengthening  of  Public  Defenders  Offices,  the  creation  of  a  National  Council  of 
Justice  and  the  implementation  of  policies  targeted  to  promote  alternative  dispute 
resolution  mechanisms.  However,  challenges  are  still  present.  The  majority  of  the 
persons in the prison system are under 29 years old (54.8  per cent) and are of African 
descent (60.8  per cent). Likewise, the incarceration rate for  women increased  567 per 
cent between 2000 and 2014, totaling 37,380 women of which 50 per cent is between 
18 and 29 years of age.14  
12. Corruption draws funding away from economic and social development, affecting 
those  living  in  poverty.  A  National  Strategy  to  Combat  Corruption  and  Money 
Laundering was created to monitor results and promote an anti -corruption society. The 
average cost of corruption in Brazil is roughly 2.3  per cent of the GDP.

13.  Brazil  needs  sustained  economic  growth  based  on  a  sustainable  and  inclusive 
development  model  and 
the  private  sector  is  called  to  play  a  crucial  role. 
Approximately  12.9  million  companies 15  employ  40  million  people.  Small  and 
medium enterprises (SME) comprising 85 per cent of this sector, but only 27  per cent 
of  national  GDP.  There  are  nine  million  micro  and  small  enterprises  and  five  million 
individual  micro-entrepreneurs 
(MEI),  of  which  500,000  are  Bolsa  Familia 
beneficiaries  (93  per  cent  are  women  and  73  per  cent  are  of African  descent).  While 
MEI  have  access  to  social  security  and  reduced  taxes,  they  have  trouble  accessing 
training and new technology.    
14. Brazilian South-South Cooperation (SSC) has provided technical cooperation to 98 
countries,  most  in  Africa  and  Latin  America,  and  particularly  Portuguese  speaking 
countries. SSC could be further optimized focusing on enhanced kn owledge brokering 
and technical and operational assistance. 
15.  Between  2012  and  2015,  UNDP  contributed  to  poverty  reduction  and  social 
inclusion  in  Brazil.16  The  “Human  Development  Atlas”  (HDA)  helped  stakeholders 
distribute  public  services  in  poorer  territories,  like  the  “Mais  Médicos”  programme, 
that  placed  14,000  doctors  in  municipalities17  with  low  Human  Development  Index 
(HDI).  Likewise, UNDP mainstreamed the MDGs across the country and created civil 
society  networks  and  policy  support  tools,  like  the  MDG  Portal,  Award,  Monitoring 
Report  and  Conference.  Inclusion  based  on  integrated  approaches  and  poverty 
reduction  strategies,  economic  growth  and  environmental  sustainability  were 
successfully  developed  for  families  in  rural  and  poor  communities.  Systema tized 
knowledge  kits,  developed  by  the  country  office  for  justice,  public  security,  local 
development,  wellbeing  and  sports,  and  inclusive  business,  will  be  scaled  up  in  the 
next cycle. 
16.  As  the  main  lessons  learnt  from  the  previous  program,  UNDP  should  increase 
dissemination  of  HDA  tool  to  keep  supporting  government  allocation  of  services  in 
municipalities  with  low  HDI.  It  should  also  have  built  on  previous  MDG  experience 
and  scale  them  up  to  mainstream  SDGs.  UNDP  should  improve  communication  and 
dissemination of results and knowledge products. UNDP should also improve projects’ 
monitoring. Finally, it should work more intensely across the territory, especially with 
poorer states and municipalities.  
17.  Hence,  inequalities  persist  between  the  rich  and  the  poor  and  across  space 
(between  rural  and  urban  areas,  within  and  among  regions),  with  the  Northeast 
performing  worse  in  most  socioeconomic  indicators.  The  rapid  urbanization  process 
resulted in high degrees of concentrated poverty in urban areas, especia lly in slums on 
fragile  lands,  exposed  to  natural  hazards.  For  the  next  programme  cycle,  UNDP  will 
support  Brazil  in  reducing  inequalities,  focusing  on  vulnerable  populations  that 
remained  on  poverty.  This  approach  is  aligned  with  the  national  priorities  i n  the 
multiyear  plan (PPA 2016-2019).  Partnerships  with  government  entities,  civil  society, 
the  private  sector,  universities,  United  Nations  organizations,  bilateral  donors  and 
international  finance  institutions  (IFIs)  are  essential  to  mobilize  funds,  leve rage 
resources and create momentum for sustainable change.

II.  Programme priorities and partnerships  
 
18.  UNDP,  together  with  other  United  Nations  organizations,  is  well  positioned  to 
support the 2030 Agenda as a platform to help transform Brazil into  a more sustainable 
country, with a view to end poverty and inequality.18 Government of Brazil (GoB) and 
UNDP  will  work  on  social  mobilization  and  territorialisation  of  SDGs  seeking  the 
participation  of  vulnerable  populations  in  public  policy  and  democratic  dialogue. 
UNDP  will  also  launch  an  SDG  monitoring  platform  in  partnership  with  IPEA.    In 
addition,  UNDP  will  provide  training  and  support  government  capacity  building  for 
mainstreaming the SDGs into public policies formulation, monitoring and evaluation.     
19.  Special  focus  will  be  placed  on  vulnerable  areas  and  populations  with  low  and 
medium HDI, especially North and Northeast rural poor and women afro -descendants, 
indigenous  people,  agro-extractivists  and  the  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual  and  transgender 
(LGBT) community, working more intensely with states and municipalities. A focus on 
reduction  of  inequalities  and  building  resilience  to  shocks  will  be  adopted  across  the 
portfolio, especially by promoting alliances between national, local and public -private 
institutions and UN agencies. 
20.  Furthermore,  UNDP  will  intensify  its  partnerships  with  Global  Centers.  The 
Istanbul International Center for Private Sector in Development will provide assistance 
on  inclusive  business.    The  Regional  Bureau  for  Latin  America  and  Caribbean  will 
provide  support  on  public  security,  gender,  social  participation,  transparency  and 
disaster  risk  management  (DRM).  UNDP  country  office  will  continue  to  support  the 
Rio+ Cente.  
People: Inclusive and equitable society with extensive rights for all men and women   
21. UNDP will partner with municipal, state and federal governments, the  civil society, 
private  sector  and  international  partners  to  roll  out  initiatives  that  address   poverty 
reduction  and  inequality  through  the  enhancement  of  public  services,  in  the  areas  of 
health,  social  assistance  and  rural  development.  UNDP  will  contribute  to  strengthen 
capacities  to  formulate,  implement,  monitor  and  evaluate  social  policies,  with 
emphasis on gender, race, ethnicity and generational equity.   
22.  UNDP  will  continue  its  efforts  to  build  resilience  of  institutions  to  economic 
shocks  and  avoid  people  falling  back  into  poverty.  UNDP  will  enhance  the  HDA,  by 
disaggregating  data  according  to  gender  and race,  incorporating  the  household  survey 
data  (RADAR  PNAD  2012-2014)  and  three  other  metropolitan  regions.  UNDP  will 
develop  a  Human  Development  Report  on  sports  and  physical  activities  and  build  a 
new platform to monitor SDGs indicators. 
23.  Technical  capacity  of  GoB  will  be  supported  to  expand  the  National  System  for 
Racial  Equality  Promotion  (SINAPIR),  strengthening  decentralization  of  racial 
equality  policy.  In  addition,  technical  capacity  will  be  provided  to  improve  rural 
extension  to  family  agriculture  and  the  Green  Grant  Program  benefitting  traditional 
peoples and communities. 
24.  UNDP  strategy  on  wellbeing  will  consider  prevention  and  treatment  of  diseases 
within  the  unified  health  system,  improving  managerial  capacity  to  guarantee  access 
for all people, particularly the most vulnerable. UNDP will support public policies and 
civil  society  initiatives  that  promote  sports  and  physical  activities  for  all  ages  and 
support  epidemiological  responses  at  government  request.    Promote  health  services 
that do not discriminate by gender, race, age or sexual identity is part of the strategy, in

partnership with Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and Joint United Nations 
Programme  on  HIV/AIDS  (UNAIDS)  to  increase  citizen  access  to  HIV  prevention, 
diagnostic and treatment services. 
25.  UNDP  will  continue  to  mainstream  gender  equality,  engaging  women  in  the 
protection,  management  and  sustainability  of  the  environment  and  its  natural 
resources. UNDP will also promote women’s empowerment to close gender gaps in the 
private sector and will cooperate with UN WOMEN and UNFPA on preventing gender 
based violence and promoting women's political empowerment.  
26.  Brazil  knowledge  on  people-centered  development  will  continue 
to  be 
systematized  and  shared  with  developing  countries  under  the  South  South  and 
triangular cooperation. The International Policy Center for Inclusive Growth (IPG -IG), 
administered  and  supported  by  UNDP  Brazil,  will  intensify  its  sharing  of  SSC 
initiatives intended to assist interested countries on the design and evaluation of social 
protection policies and programmes.  
Planet:  Sustainable  management  of  natural  resources  for  present  and  future 
generations  
27.  UNDP  will  work  with  GoB  to  implement  national  environmental  legislation, 
multilateral  and  international  commitments,  focused  on  biodiversity,  desertification, 
chemicals, Montreal protocol and climate change. 
28. UNDP will support the GoB in the implementation of an environmental regulatory 
framework  and  related  policies  that  promote  sustainable  management  of  natural 
resources,  effective  ecosystem  services,  land  use  and  land  use  change,  recovery  of 
degraded  areas,  as  well  as  territorial  and  environmental  management,  by  indigenous 
people,  quilombolas  and  rural  populations  in  order  to  improve  their  resilience  to 
climate  change,  to  reduce  land  degradation  and  also  to  guarantee  their  constitutional 
rights.  By  working  with  vulnerable  groups,  UNDP  will  promote  their  productive 
inclusion and access to markets, increasing their income from maintaining  the standing 
forests.  
29.  Strengthening  the  resilience  of  target  populations,  will  improve  their  livelihoods, 
thereby  reducing  their  vulnerabilities  to  the  impact  of  climate  change  and  natural 
disasters. Given the impact of climate change in desertification, disasters’ increase and 
the  deepening  of poverty  in  groups at  risk,  UNDP  will  support the implementation of 
INDC,  mitigation  and  adaptation  measures, and promote  energy efficiency,  renewable 
energy,  sustainable  transportation,  and  chemical  and  waste  management.  UNDP  will 
cooperate  with  state  authorities,  academia  and  civil  society  to  strengthen  national 
DRM  capacities  through  data  production,  capacity  building  of  civil  servants  and 
technical  advisory  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  public  policies  that  have  a 
gender sensitive and inter-sectorial approach, with a focus on poorer areas. 
30.  UNDP  will  promote  partnerships  that  encourage  the  adoption  of  sustainable 
production  and  consumption  patterns  (and  include  a  gender  dimension).  By  way  of 
Montreal protocol, UNDP will promote awareness and enhanced the technical capacity 
of  companies  involved  in  Ozone  Depleting  Substances  phase  out.  The  reduction  of 
pollution  and  hazardous  substances  into  the  atmosphere  will  certainly  bring  positive 
impacts to diseases control and health.    
31.  UNDP  will  promote  an  enabling  environment  for  the  sustainability  of  cities, 
communities  and  territories  through  policies  built  on  the  results  of  the  metropolitan 
HDA.

Prosperity: Prosperity and quality of life for everyone  
32.  Economic  development  is  critical  for  poverty  and  inequality  reduction.  In  Brazil, 
UNDP  will  support  an  inclusive  approach  to  economic  growth  by  providing 
information  and  methodologies  to  expand  inclusive  business  at  the  bottom  of  the 
pyramid  in  order  to  raise  income  of  5,140  micro  and  small  enterprises  and  1,087,860 
MEI  attended  by  the  Serviço  Brasileiro  de  Apoio  às  Micro  e  Pequenas  Empresas 
(SEBRAE),  of  which  52  per  cent  are  men  and  48  per  cent  are  women.  This  will 
strengthen  the  capacity  of  15  business  accelerators  and  incubators  to  support  the 
implementation of inclusive business models.  
33. In Brazil, 68 per cent of population has simplified account, of which  58.5 per cent 
are  among  the  40  per  cent  poorest,  64.8  per  cent  are  women  and  52.6  per  cent  are 
young adults. UNDP will work with national actors to develop a set of studies, support 
technological innovation and disseminate information in order to increase the qualified 
use of credit and savings accounts across the country, facilitating access to  capital, and 
opening  opportunities  to  economic  growth  and  income  generation.  Special  attention 
will be given to developing business models that incorporates a gender perspective.  
34.  UNDP  will  provide  technical  assistance  to  national  and  local  stakeholder s. 
Infrastructure,  logistics  and  basic  services  will  be  strengthened  so  that  business 
communities can reach underserviced areas. 
35.  UNDP  will  expand  multi-stakeholder  partnerships  by  engaging  further  with 
business  networks,  public  and  private  companies,  philanthropic  foundations  and 
media,  advocating  for  greater  awareness  on  sustainable  consumption  and  production 
patterns.  Likewise,  UNDP  will  promote  an  inclusive  dialogue  with  extractive 
industries and affected populations on sustainable development. UNDP  will encourage 
public-private  collaboration  for  development,  including  the  organization  of  relevant 
large events.   
Peace: Peaceful, fair and inclusive society  
36. The rule of law and development are mutually reinforcing and, as such, promoting 
an environment based on democratic governance, rule of law, justice and peace is key 
to  the  promotion  of  public  policies  and  initiatives  focused  on  poverty  and  inequality 
reduction.  In 
this  context,  UNDP  will  support  federal,  states  and  municipal 
governments,  the  judiciary  and  legislative  powers  to  develop  initiatives  related  to 
promote peaceful  and inclusive  societies,  especially  for  vulnerable  populations.  Close 
attention  will  be  paid  to  municipalities  with  a  lower  HDI,  considering  gender,  race, 
ethnicity and generational inequalities.  
37.  Innovative  approaches  to  violence  prevention  and  control  will  be  prioritized  by 
promoting coordination and intragovernmental dialogue with a multidisciplinary vision 
of  the  violence  issue.  Citizen  participation  and  gender  mainstr eaming  will  be  key  in 
the  process  of  design,  implementation  and  monitoring  of  public  security  policies. 
UNDP  will  join  efforts  with  GoB  and  other  agencies  to  eradicate  violence  against 
women and girls.  
38.  Promoting  access  to  justice,  will  be  involve  strengthening  of  justice  institutions, 
like  Public  Defenders  and  Prosecutors,  their  respective  access  mechanisms,  and 
supporting  alternative  mechanisms,  that  lead  to  peaceful  resolution  of  conflicts. 
Furthermore,  improving  management  and  access  to  justice  in  prisons,  fostering  the 
implementation  of  guidelines  that  secure  prisoners’  rights  and  changing  the  practices 
that  contribute  to  excessive  imprisonment  in  the  country,  especially  for  women,  will 
also be prioritized.

39.  With  regards  to  human  rights,  UNDP  will  support  public  policies  (at  national  and 
sub-national levels), that promote  dialogue  with  civil  society  and  focus  on  vulnerable 
population,  like  LGBT  community,  African  Brazilian  women  and 
immigrants. 
Furthermore,  UNDP  will  support  the  elaboration  of  the  Stigma  Index  with  other  UN 
agencies and partners. 
40.  To  achieve  inclusive  and  responsive  institutions,  and  reduce  corruption  in  all  its 
forms,  democratic  dialogue  will  be  used  as  a  tool  to  collectively  build  a  more 
transparent  and  accountable  culture  and  reduce  one  of  the  major  barriers  to  achieve 
SDGs.  
41.  UNDP  will  support  the  modernization  of  the  state  especially  the  at  sub -national 
level  and  promote  tools  such  as  the  Management  System  for  Governance -SIGOB  and 
best practices for enhancing public management and effective public services delivery, 
particularly in municipalities with a lower HDI.  
 
III.  Programme and risk management  
 
to 
42.  This  country  programme  document  outlines  UNDP  contributions 
the 
achievement of national priorities in Brazil and is the primary unit of accountability to 
the Executive Board for results alignment and resources assigned to the programme at 
country  level.  Accountabilities  of  managers  at  the  country,  regional  and  headquarter 
levels,  with  respect  to  country  programmes  is  prescribed  in  the  organization’s 
programmatic  and  operational  policies  and  procedures  and  the  internal  controls 
framework.  This  programme  will  be  nationally  executed  under  the  Ministry  of 
international 
External  Relations  as 
cooperation.  UNDP  will  provide  implementation  support  as  needed.  Other  modalities 
may  be  pursued,  including  with  UN  or  non-governmental  organizations,  or  by  direct 
UNDP  implementation  to  achieve  objectives  in  line  with  institutional  procedures. 
UNDP  social  and  environmental  standards  will  be  applied to  ensure that  development 
is  inclusive,  human  rights-based  and  protective  of  the  environment.  Harmonized 
approach  to  cash  transfer  (HACT)  and  fast-track  procedures  may  be  applied,  as 
needed.  UNDP  will  support  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Joint  Operation 
Facility in Brazil, incorporating it in Country Office business model.

43.  The  programme  is  aligned  with  the  priorities  in  the  PPA  2016-2019,  the  United 
Nations  Development  Assistance  Framework  (UNDAF  2017 -2021),  and  the  UNDP 
Strategic Plan 2014-2017, and incorporates the SDGs in its implementation strategy. A 
programme  management  committee  will  be  set  up  with  national  counterparts  to 
oversee programme implementation. 
44.  UNDP  will  expand  its  partnership  strategy,  build  upon  existing  ones  and  develop 
alliances  with  new  stakeholders,  such  as  sub-national  governments,  IFIs,  the  private 
sector, media and national institutions.  
45.  Programme  risks  are  related  to  currency  fluctuations  and  political  instabilities, 
(e.g.  municipal  elections  in  2016  and  state  government  and  presidential  elections  in 
2018)  that  are  likely  to  change  the  policy  priorities  of  sub -national  and  national 
governments. To mitigate such risks, UNDP will engage in a dialogue with candidates 
and  authorities  across  the  political  spectrum,  aligning  initiatives  with  government 
plans  and  policies.  Fiscal  deficits,  high  inflation,  dependency  on  commo dities  and 
decreasing  oil  prices  constitute  risks  to  government  revenues  and  investments.  Those 
risks  demand  sound  analysis  from  UNDP  to  support  GoB  to  increase  public  sector 
efficiency and promote structural reforms.

46. UNDP will mobilize funds and in-kind contributions from national counterparts at 
all  levels  of  government,  IFIs,  the  private  sector,  international  donors  interested  in 
partnering with GoB. A resource mobilization strategy will cover the program cycle.    
 
IV. Monitoring and evaluation 
 
47.  Indicators,  baselines  and  targets  set  bases  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E). 
Most  data  will  be  gathered  from  national  stakeholders,  like  the  Brazilian  Institute  of 
Geography  and  Statistics  (IBGE),  sector  organizations  and  others.  Data  will  be 
disaggregated by sex, race, age and other relevant variables. Data generation strategies 
will  be  designed  to  improve  national  monitoring  capacities,  particularly  at  the  local 
level  and include  SDG indicators platform.  UNDP  will strengthen its  M&E  capacities 
so  it  can  assist  in  monitoring  the  UNDAF  and  the  inter-agency  information 
management  
48.  Currently,  UNDP  Gender  Marker  scored  two  GEN3  and 14  GEN2  projects,  worth 
6.2  million  dollars  (12.4  of  delivery).  To  improve  Gender  Marker  and  Gender 
capacities  in  the  Country  Office,  UNDP  will  strengthen  its  Gender  Equality  Strategy 
with specific projects and activities that focus women empowerment.   
49.  Annual  reviews  of  CPD  implementation  will  be  organized  jointly  by  UNDP  and 
ABC with all partners. It will be reinforced with  a comprehensive planning, M&E and 
knowledge management strategy.  
50.  The strategy  will include: (a)  quality assurance support  mechanisms to ensure the 
use  of  results-based  management,  gender-based  approaches,  identification  of  SSC 
opportunities,  and  capacity  development;  (b)  evaluation  plan  to  support  decision-
making, learning and accountability; and (c) a communications plan.
