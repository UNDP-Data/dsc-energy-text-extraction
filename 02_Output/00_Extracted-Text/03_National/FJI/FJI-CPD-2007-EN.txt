Introduction 
 
1.  The  UNDP  multi-country  programme  document  (MCPD)  2008-2012  has  been  endorsed  by  the 
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Solomon Islands, Tonga, 
Tuvalu  and  Vanuatu  following  wide  stakeholder  consultations  with  governments,  civil  society, 
regional organizations and development partners. The MCPD will be implemented by the UNDP Fiji 
multi-country office (MCO) and is aligned with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), country 
priorities  as  reflected  in  national  development  plans,  the  regional  United  Nations  Development 
Assistance  Framework  (UNDAF)  2008-2012  and  the  Pacific  Plan  for  regional  integration  and 
cooperation. 
I.  Situation analysis 
2.  Pacific island countries (PICs) face common challenges resulting from their small size, geographic 
isolation and natural disaster vulnerability. Broadly, Melanesia (Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu) is 
characterized by larger, resource-rich land masses and populations; Polynesia (Tuvalu and Tonga) by 
smaller  but  relatively  compact  land  masses,  and  Micronesia  (Kiribati,  Marshall  Islands,  Federated 
States  of  Micronesia,  Palau and Nauru)  by  very  small  and  widely  dispersed  resource-poor  atolls.  As 
Small  Island  Developing  States  (SIDS),  PICs  have  committed  to  the  Mauritius  Strategy  and  their 
National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDS) are being increasingly aligned with the MDGs. 
The Pacific region has been experiencing high levels of poverty and low levels of economic growth; 
coupled  with  low  human  development  gains  in  past  decades,  many  PICs  are  in  danger  of  missing 
critical MDG 1, 3 and 6 targets. 
3.  Even  though  over  the  past  decade,  a  number  of  PICs  have  achieved  improved  macroeconomic 
outcomes,  this  has  not  translated  into  rises  in  per  capita  incomes  in  light  of  population  growth  of 
around  2.4  percent  in  the  medium  term.  The  significant  net  aid  inflows  to  PICs  have  yet  to  be 
integrated in national planning and budgeting processes. Increasingly PICs are focusing on the Pacific 
Aid Effectiveness Principles and their capacity for aid coordination and management, adopting sector 
wide  approaches  (Kiribati,  Solomon  Islands,  Tuvalu)  in  education  and  health.  Ensuring  inclusive 
growth and globalization is particularly challenging in the least developed countries (Kiribati, Solomon 
Islands,  Tuvalu  and  Vanuatu).  Across  the  region,  these  problems  are  compounded  by  unfavourable 
policies  and  regulatory  environment  for  trade  and  private  sector  development.  Due  to  the  lack  of 
employment  opportunities,  increasing  hardship  and  social  instability,  inequality  has  disproportionate 
2 
 
DP/DCP/FJI/1
 
impact  on  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  rural  poor,  women  and  girls,  who  remain  disadvantaged  to 
varying degrees in education, access to labour markets and political representation, as well as young 
people aged 15-24, who comprise almost half the population in some countries. In addition, available 
evidence  on  HIV  infection  rates,  especially  among  people  aged  15-49,  point  to  the  possibility  of  a 
rapidly  escalating  HIV  epidemic  and  multi-sectoral  approaches  to  prevention,  care  and  treatment 
efforts are seen as imperative. 
4.  Sustainable  and  equitable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  are  dependent  on  significant 
governance improvements. Increasing concerns over alleged abuse of power, corruption and cronyism 
has  contributed  to  instability  and  conflict  and  a  failure  to  uphold  human  rights.  Accountability 
institutions  are  often  under-resourced  and/or  poorly  functioning.  Although  decentralization  and 
participatory decision making are being enhanced in small atoll countries such as Kiribati and Tuvalu, 
mechanisms  to  encourage  full  and  real  participation  by  women  and  minority  groups  are  largely 
lacking. Leveraging information and communication technology (ICT) for local government and outer 
island  planning  and  management  requires  action.  As in  various  PICs,  the  value of broad-based  civic 
education programmes is increasingly recognized. Civil society organizations (CSOs) are increasingly 
seen  as  key  partners  by  governments  and  donors  in  governance  and  human  rights  education.  While 
many  PICs  have  ratified  key  human  rights  conventions,  there  are  shortcomings  in  reporting.  All 
countries  but  three  have  ratified  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination 
against Women and have national plans of action to promote gender equality and strategies to address 
gender-based violence, but most do not have legal and institutional mechanisms to implement them. 
5.  Exposure to natural hazards such as volcanoes, tsunami’s, cyclones, earthquakes (Solomon Islands 
and Vanuatu who are among the most disaster prone countries in the world) and experiences of civil 
unrest and conflict over the past decade (Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu), have highlighted 
the need to focus more strongly on disaster risk reduction, peace and stability dialogues, early warning 
systems, and the role of women in crisis prevention and recovery. In the long-term, it is increasingly 
recognized that democratic governance and poverty reduction are key in preventing potential conflicts. 
Tensions  between  traditional  and  modern  systems  of  governance  contribute  to  this  pattern  or  curtail 
effective mitigation as seen in Tonga and in Fiji. The Solomon Islands experienced instability due to 
ethnic  tension  and  civil  unrest  from  1999  to  2002.  Stability  and  an  environment  conducive  to  the 
strengthening  of  Solomon  Island’s  peace  architecture  have  emerged  from  various  interventions, 
including the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI). The recent 
3
 
 
DP/DCP/FJI/1 
 
political  crisis  in  Fiji  and  the  Secretary  General’s  call  for  an  early  return  to  democracy,  indicate  the 
need for an enhanced focus on good governance, peace dialogue and building community resilience. 
6.  Almost  all  PICs  rely  heavily  on  primary  commodity  production  and  exports,  marine-based 
resources,  and  tourism,  highlighting  community-based  management  of  natural  resources  and 
maintenance of the environment as a key to growth and poverty reduction. Competing demands on the 
environment  and  differentiated  impacts  of  climate  change  (Kiribati  and  Tuvalu),  waste  management 
(Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati and Marshall Islands), and poor natural resource management 
pose significant challenges to all PICs due to their limited resource base. Contributing factors include: 
limited integration and non-implementation of environment in national or sectoral plans and strategies, 
non-existent or outdated environmental legislation, limited documentation of traditional practices, and 
inadequate  capacities  of  communities  to  practice  responsible  and  equitable  harvesting  of  natural 
resources.  Concerns  about  improving  equitable  access  to  natural  resources,  including  renewable 
energy,  to  enable  opportunities  for  sustainable  livelihood  options  require  special  consideration  given 
the patrilineal nature of most Pacific societies. Increasingly, environmental policy is mainstreamed into 
national and regional agreements and frameworks, such as the Micronesia Challenge. 
7.  Stronger  regional  cooperation  presents  opportunities  for  countries  with  constrained  capacity  to 
implement effective national policies and provide basic services to meet the needs of their people. The 
Pacific  Plan  has  established  a  framework  to  support  national  development  policies,  including 
commitments  to  the  MDGs.  The  relatively  small  circle  of  development  partners  in  the  Pacific  can 
enhance  the  way  aid  is  delivered  and  managed  in  line  with  the  Paris  Declaration  and  the  Pacific 
Principles on Aid Effectiveness.

Update, Asian Development Bank; Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat 
II.  Past cooperation and lessons learned 
8.  Under the previous programme cycle, UNDP support was prioritized under three related areas:  
(a)  Poverty  reduction  and  sustainable  livelihoods  for  MDGs  achievement:  facilitating 
financial services for the poor in Fiji, Vanuatu and Marshall Islands; policy development for 
inclusive  growth  and  globalization  in  Palau,  Marshall  Islands  and  Federated  States  of 
Micronesia; sustainable livelihoods in Marshall Islands. 
(b)  Democratic  governance  and  human  rights  through  parliamentary  strengthening  in  Fiji, 
Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands; decentralization and local governance in Tuvalu and 
Kiribati; participatory democracy and civic education in Tonga; peace and stability in Fiji and 
Solomon Islands; human rights advocacy for policy development and community education, 
and HIV/AIDS across the region.  
(c)  Environmental  protection  and  resource  management 
through  programmes 
in 
environmental governance, climate change, biodiversity, energy and waste management with 
differentiated focus in the 10 PICs. A key focus has been on assisting countries to meet their 
obligations under various multilateral and regional environment agreements (MEAs). 
9.  Tripartite  Project  Reviews  (TPRs)  and  project  evaluations  confirm  the  emphasis  of  the  previous 
cycle, with some adjustments needed to fine-tune the future programme. These include the need to:  
(a)  Adopt  a  more  strategic  and  targeted  focus  on  key  outcomes  to  maximize  impact.  Programme 
effectiveness  has  been  challenged  by  the  unique  role  of  the  MCO  to  spread  resources  across 
10 countries.  Clear  programme  objectives,  realistic  targets,  measurable  indicators  and  appropriate 
sequencing of capacity, culture and gender disparities need to be prioritized.  
(b)  Ensure  national  commitment  to  and  ownership  of  programmes,  use  of  national  development 
frameworks and systems in consultative processes, more frequent country visits, and continued training 
at national, regional and international levels. An expanded joint United Nations presence in countries 
will  improve  UNDP’s  engagement  in  national  development  dialogue  and  development  support 
services. 
(c)  Build  stronger  partnerships  at  the  highest  levels.  While  improved  coordination  with  other 
5
 
 
DP/DCP/FJI/1 
 
partners was a noted achievement, programmatic linkages with other United Nations agencies, funds 
and programmes working in the region and with the Council of Regional Organizations of the Pacific 
(CROP) have been relatively weak. Enhanced donor partnerships will help to continue the recent trend 
of improved resource mobilization. 
III.  Proposed programme 
10.  Taking into account lessons learned in the past programming cycle, the MCPD 2008-2012 seeks to 
respond  to  current  and  emerging  development  challenges  of  PICs,  through  continued  emphasis  on 
capacity development; stronger partnerships at national level and robust engagement and coordination 
with  key  stakeholders;  strategic  programmatic  focus  and  leveraging  of  regular  resources  in  high 
impact areas; and strengthening regional and national linkages to support the Pacific Plan. 
11.  In alignment with the UNDAF, the goal of the MCPD is to achieve the MDGs through building 
resilient and inclusive societies, based on four key inter-related outcome areas of poverty reduction and 
the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  good  governance  and  human  rights,  crisis  prevention  and 
recovery, and environment and sustainable management across the ten countries.  
Outcome 1. Poverty reduction and the Millennium Development Goals  
12.  UNDP  will  assist  PICs  in  developing  and  implement  evidence-based  and  inclusive  NSDS  to 
stimulate  inclusive  economic  growth,  facilitate  inclusive  globalization  and  promote  sustainable 
livelihoods through support to: (a) formulation and implementation of national and sectoral plans and 
strategies  aligned  with  MDGs,  targets  and  indicators  and  clearly  linked  to  national  budgets;  (b) 
strengthening  capacity  of  national  statistical  systems  to  generate  disaggregated  poverty  data  and 
analyses;  (c) Improving  Aid  Management  systems  linking  to  national  plans  and  budgets;  (d) 
facilitation  of  inclusive  and  equitable  trade  mechanisms,  private  sector  partnerships,  employment 
generation  policies  and  enhancing  financial  competencies;  and    (e)  multi-sectoral  planning  and 
leadership capacity development to enhance the engagement of communities and decision makers at all 
levels to take immediate action on HIV and AIDS. Country level programmatic activities will take into 
account  intra-regional  socio-economic  patterns  and  variations,  with  special  emphasis  on  the  least 
developed countries (Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu), as well as on women and other 
vulnerable groups across the region.

DP/DCP/FJI/1
 
Outcome 2. Good governance and human rights  
13.  UNDP will strengthen national policy capacities and governance systems to exercise the principles 
of  inclusive,  equitable,  participatory,  transparent  and  accountable  governance  and  respect  for  human 
rights;  and  will  support  the  role  of  resilient  Pacific  communities  in  decision-making  at  all  levels. 
Specific programmatic activities will be geared towards: (a) countries demonstrating and upholding the 
Forum principles of good leadership and accountability; (b) enhancing decentralization of governance, 
information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  development,  and  participatory  decision  making 
targeting vulnerable groups; and (c) awareness of human rights and the availability of mechanisms to 
claim them. The focus will be on enhancing participatory democracy through civic and human rights 
education in all countries of the Pacific; decentralized governance for development and participatory 
decision making in Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu; and parliamentary support, 
subject to the evolving priorities and demands of the Pacific countries. 
Outcome 3. Crisis prevention and recovery 
14.  UNDP  will  assist  countries  to  strengthen  capacity  to  prevent  and  manage  crises  and  build 
resilience  to  the  impact  of  tensions  and  disasters.  This  will  be  achieved  through:  (a)  support  to  the 
development of an integrated approach to addressing and reducing vulnerability to tension and disaster; 
(b) effective recovery strategies that seek to build capacity to address the root causes of humanitarian 
crisis and natural disasters; and (c) addressing the long term livelihood needs of communities. UNDP 
will  focus  on  formalizing  institutional  mechanisms  for  mainstreaming  disaster  risk  reduction  into 
national  development  and  budgetary  strategies  (in  Solomon  Islands  and  Vanuatu);  and  development 
and implementation of national policies and plans addressing human security through conflict-sensitive 
analysis and tension reduction interventions (in Fiji, Marshall Islands, Tonga and  Solomon Islands). 
Outcome 4. Environment and sustainable management 
15.  UNDP will leverage global expertise and resources, and utilize innovative approaches to support a 
more  resilient  region  with  strengthened  capacity  for  sustainable  management  of  environment  and 
natural  resources  through:  (a)  the  mainstreaming  of  environmental  sustainability  and  sustainable 
energy  into  national  policies,  planning frameworks  and  programmes  (in  all  countries of  the  Pacific); 
and (b) strengthening institutional support, including indigenous governance systems, to contribute to 
sustainable  environmental  management  and  usage  through  appropriate  policies,  legislation  and 
7
 
 
DP/DCP/FJI/1 
 
traditional knowledge and practices for enhanced sustainable livelihoods (in Kiribati, Solomon Islands, 
Tuvalu  and  Vanuatu).  The  focus  will  be  on  environmental  governance,  including  promotion  of 
sustainable  renewable  energy  and  adaptation  to  climate  change  into  national  strategies,  as  well  as 
improving access to and management of multilateral environment agreements (MEAs). Programmatic 
activities will further focus on partnerships and capacity development in order to strengthen the nexus 
among  poverty  reduction,  sustainable  environmental  management  and  gender  equity.  The  Global 
Environment  Facility  Small  Grants  Programme-NZAID  Pacific  Environment  Fund  model  will  be 
examined  for  the  possible  up-scaling  of  pilot  projects,  including  the  potential  for  further  support  for 
renewable energy and adaptation to climate change projects. 
Cross-cutting themes and joint programmes 
16.  UNDP programming will address the linkages between these four objectives, and mainstream key 
cross-cutting themes into country-specific priorities. This includes the promotion of human rights and 
protecting  the  dignity  and  integrity  of  all  people;  gender  equity,  guided  by  the  Convention  on  the 
Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Violence  against  Women  and  the  Pacific  Platform  for  Action  on  the 
Advancement  of  Women  and  Gender  Equality  2005-2015;  and  promoting  volunteerism.  Joint 
programmes  will  support  national  development,  linkages  and  cohesion  in  the  areas  of  HIV/AIDS, 
young people, national planning for MDG achievement, support to civil society, and, subject to inter-
agency agreement, environmental and disaster risk management. 
IV.  Programme management, monitoring and evaluation  
A.  Implementation 
17.  The MCPD and the results framework will form the basis of agreed Country Programme Action 
Plans  for  the  10  PICs,  and  will  be  reviewed  annually.  Implementation,  primarily  through  National 
Execution (NEX), will help reduce the transaction costs of governments, establish clear accountability 
and  oversight  structures  and  maximize  efficient  and  effective  programme  delivery  through  results-
based  management  methodologies.  Where  national  capacity  is  constrained,  alternative  execution 
modalities such as Direct Execution (DEX) will be explored.  
18.  Delivery  of  the  MCPD  will  be  underpinned  by  the  expanded  joint  United  Nations  expanded 
presence,  under  reciprocity  arrangements  with  UNFPA  and  UNICEF  in  Federated  States  of 
Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru Palau, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. With in-
8 
 
DP/DCP/FJI/1
 
house  expertise  in  key  programme  areas,  the  Fiji  MCO  will  provide  support  services,  training  and 
advice to implementation partners in project formulation, implementation, monitoring, human rights-
based  approaches  and  gender-sensitive  programming.  Formulation  of  joint  programmes,  advice  and 
support  from  the  Pacific  Centre  in  Fiji,  as  well  as  from  the  United  Nations  Volunteers  (UNV) 
programme, will be leveraged to enhance programme effectiveness. 
B.  Monitoring and evaluation 
19.  Overall progress of the MCPD implementation will be measured under the MCPD Evaluation plan 
and  through  independent  and  participatory  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  processes.  Annual 
Programme  reviews  with  national  implementation  partners  will  track  resource  allocation,  activity 
progress and constraints under the overall direction of UNDAF Outcome Boards. Wherever possible, 
MCPD  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities  will  be  aligned  with  regional  and  national  M&E 
frameworks.  Appropriate  resources  and  capacity  will  be  made  available  for  the  systematic 
implementation and dissemination of evaluation recommendations to emphasize the critical importance 
of evaluation as a tool for policy engagement and programme monitoring. 
20.  Of  the  11  programme  outcomes  of  the  MCPD,  four  specific  outcome  evaluations  will  be 
undertaken  with  Governments  and  stakeholders  throughout  the  programming  period,  in  line  with 
UNDP  procedures.  A  final  evaluation  of  the  implementation  of  the  MCPD  in  its  entirety  will  be 
conducted towards the end of 2008-2012 programming cycle, to inform the subsequent MCPD.  
C.  Partnerships and aid effectiveness 
21.  In  support  of  the  resident  coordinator  system,  UNDP  will  leverage  its  resources  to  lead  the 
harmonization  of  United  Nations  programmes  to  support  reforms  under  the  multi-country  UNDAF. 
Partnerships will be strengthened through coordination and harmonization with development partners; 
working  with  civil  society  and  vulnerable  communities;  and  through  CROP  to  support  national 
responses under the Pacific Plan.  
22.  The  MCPD  will  strive  to  build  national  capacity  for  aid  management,  and  simplification  and 
harmonization  of  aid  delivery  in  accordance  with  the  Pacific  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness. 
Operational  tools,  such  as  the  Harmonized  Approach  to  Cash  Transfers,  will  be  used  to  facilitate 
collaborative donor procedures in alignment with national processes and institutional capacities.

DP/DCP/FJI/1 
 
D.  Resource mobilization 
23.  Total  resource  requirements  of  the  MCPD  are  estimated  at  $52  million,  of  which  $3  million 
constitutes  existing  pipeline  commitments  and  carry  over  from  the  current  cycle,  resulting  in 
$49 million of net resource requirements for the new programming cycle. This scope of programmatic 
engagement will be supported by funding from regular resources (TRAC) in the amount of $8 million, 
with other resources contributing an estimated $20 million from GEF, and $10 million from UNDEF, 
DGTF  and  other  thematic  trust  funds.  The  remainder  of  $11  million  is  to  be  mobilized  through 
government and third party cost-sharing. 
E.  Multi-country office staffing and structure 
24.  Building  on  results  accomplished  through  previous  re-organizations,  the  MCO  will  continue  to 
fine-tune its internal structure, seeking to strengthen accountability for results, programme efficiency 
and  operational  efficiency.  The  Solomon  Islands  Programme  Implementation  Office  (to  be 
mainstreamed  under  the  biennium  support  budget)  will  be  headed  by  a  Deputy  Resident 
Representative, who also will have managerial and representational responsibilities for the joint office 
Presence of UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF. In addition, on behalf of UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF the 
MCO  will  establish  joint  presence  in  Nauru,  Palau  and  Tuvalu  to  be  funded  initially  from  regional 
programme  resources.  Staffing  implications  of  an  expanded  presence  in  the  Pacific  and  operational 
capacity  requirements  of  the  envisaged  programme  growth  will  be  considered  prior  to  and  at  the 
beginning of the new cycle.
