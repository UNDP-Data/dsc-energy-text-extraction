Executive summary 
This report is part of the National Energy Policy review and supplements the draft National 
Energy Policy (NEP) document and Strategic Action Plan (SAP). The purpose of this 
legislative gap analysis is to identify what new legislation is needed and which existing 
legislation needs to be amended to assist effective implementation of the NEP. 
Our approach 
Implementing new legislation, primary legislation in particular, takes time. This is 
particularly so where it involves creating new agencies or expanding the powers of existing 
agencies which, inevitably, will lead to concerns among existing agencies who fear losing 
out. In making our recommendations on how to address legislative gaps we have been 
conscious of this risk and the need to avoid making implementation of the NEP as a whole 
dependent on the passage of new legislation which may be subject to many delays. 
We have, therefore, adopted a two-step process in our recommendations: 
 
Initially, the NEP will be implemented as far as possible through the existing 
legal powers of the concerned agencies. Primary legislative activity is limited to 
the most urgent amendments to existing legislation without which key parts of 
the NEP would fail. 
 
The institutional and legal reforms needed to fully implement the NEP will be 
embedded through new primary legislation at a later stage, with adequate 
time allowed for this to be enacted. Implementation of the NEP is not 
dependent on the passage of this legislation. However, it is necessary to ensure 
that measures under the NEP are sustained and to remove the risk of rapid 
reversal or change which would introduce uncertainty and risk private 
investment in particular. 
As well as supporting the rapid implementation of the NEP, this two-step process has the 
advantage that it allows time to build consensus around the institutional reforms required 
and to pilot aspects of the NEP with the resulting lessons learned incorporated into the final 
legislation. 
Recommended initial changes 
Our recommended initial changes to implement the NEP include the following: 
 
Issue a new Cabinet Decision or Decree to establish the NECC and empower 
DoE – No new primary legislation is needed to establish the National Energy 
Coordination Committee (NECC), as the membership of NECC only includes 
already existing institutions. Therefore, a Cabinet Decision or Decree is sufficient 
to establish NECC, and provides for its mandates, functions and operations as 
well as empower the Department of Energy (DoE) as the NECC secretariat.

Executive summary 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revise the Electricity Act – This is the only amendments to existing legislation 
that is required immediately. This should include specifying that: (1) Technical 
regulatory functions should be removed from Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA) 
and transferred to a new agency or unit under DoE. This includes the issuance of 
licences to operate electrical installation that is currently FEA’s responsibility. (2) 
The Commerce Commission will remain responsible for economic regulation; 
however it should be given powers to implement these responsibilities through a 
multi-year regulatory contract or similar instrument. (3) Allow DoE to enact 
secondary legislation (regulations) to cover specific topics in relation to the 
implementation of the NEP. (4) Give DoE the authority for developing an IPP 
framework, with FEA as the main implementing agency.  
 
Enact new secondary legislation/regulations – Including an IPP framework 
regulation, feed-in tariffs and net metering regulation, electrification fund 
regulation, renewable energy technology standards, Energy Service Company 
(ESCO) regulation, vehicle fuel efficiency standards and labelling regulation, and 
petroleum and alternative fuel data release regulation. 
 
Change existing policy documents and regulations – Including changes to the 
Department of Transport’s land and maritime policies, the Commerce 
Commission’s fuel pricing template, the Fiji Tax and Customs Incentives 
Brochure, the Public Health (National Building Code) Regulation. 
Recommended longer-term changes  
The initial changes that we recommended above are vulnerable to subsequent change. New 
over-arching primary legislation will be needed to ‘lock-in’ these changes and reduce the 
risk of radical revisions of policy in future. Therefore towards the end of the NEP period 
(2014-2020) this legislative gap analysis should be updated and a comprehensive Energy 
Act be prepared.  
Provisions that the Energy Act should include the establishment of NECC, specific mandates 
for DoE, reporting & monitoring requirements to be followed by DoE, establishment of the 
National Energy Consultative Forum (NECF), clear allocation of the regulatory functions in 
the electricity sector, IPP framework, provisions for rural electrification and allocation of 
responsibility to DoE, provisions for renewable energy sources inventory and allocation of 
the responsibility to update and maintain this inventory to DoE, provisions for energy 
efficient transport policies, provisions for data collection on petroleum products, confirming 
the Commerce Commission’s responsibility of regulating fuel prices, provisions for biofuel 
research activities and the regulation of the usage and sale of biofuel products, and 
provisions for energy efficiency measures undertaken by DoE.

Introduction 
This report is part of the National Energy Policy review and supplements the National 
Energy Policy (NEP) document and Strategic Action Plan (SAP).  
Objective and scope of the legislative gap analysis 
The Terms of Reference (TOR) requires a gap analysis of existing energy related legislation 
in relation to the needs of the revised energy policy. The purpose of the legislative gap 
analysis is to identify, if and what, new legislation is needed and which existing legislation 
needs to be amended to assist effective implement the National Energy Policy and Strategic 
Action Plan. 
This gap analysis reviews legislation that is related to the energy sector. Focus is given to 
legislation that is directly related to the energy sector and an in-depth analysis is done. 
Where other legislation is relevant to the implementation of the proposed energy policy, it is 
identified and reviewed to ensure consistency with the new energy policy. This analysis is 
also mostly focused primary legislation. Relevant secondary legislation such as regulations 
and Cabinet Orders, has been identified and where possible reviewed and analyse. 
Approach to the legislative gap analysis 
The approach taken to review the relevant legislation is as follows: 
 
Identify primary legislation directly relevant to the energy sector and to the 
implementation of the proposed energy policy – Section 2.1 
 
Review of other legislation that are relevant and will be affected by the 
implementation of the energy policy. This is summarised in Section 2.2 
 
In-depth analysis of key legislation that has the greatest impact on the 
implementation of the proposed energy policy – Section 2.3 
 
Identify and analyse any significant gaps in the legislation that could affect the 
implementation of the policy – Section 3 
 
Recommend actions to be taken to ensure that the legislative framework can 
accommodate the implementation of the proposed energy policies – Section 4 
In developing the recommendations, focus is given to changes that can be enacted rapidly in 
order to take advantage of the momentum to implement the energy policy sooner rather 
than later. Currently planned (and known) changes are also taken into account. These 
changes to existing legislation will enable the enactment of the energy policy without having 
to go through the lengthy process of enacting a new primary legislation. However, these 
changes will assist in setting up the scene and will support the enactment of a more 
comprehensive Energy Act, which will consolidate these changes, address other institutional 
issues and provide a solid basis for wider programmes incorporating lessons from initial 
implementation of the energy policy.

2  Review of legislation 
There are a vast number of laws that are relevant to the energy sector. Therefore, this section 
starts by identifying key legislation that will be affected by or have an impact on the NEP, by 
policy area.  
Once identified, each of the relevant legislation is then summarised, listing all the relevant 
clauses and how these may be affected by or have an impact on each of the policy areas. 
Through this process, the key legislation that has direct impact on the implementation of the 
proposed energy policy is identified and discussed in more detailed. 
2.1 
Identification of relevant legislation 
For each of the policy areas in the NEP, related existing legislation is identified and 
summarised in Table 1 below. The governance and institutional arrangements detailed in 
the NEP are also considered a ‘policy area’.

Draft Legislative Gap Analysis 
12  
 
Review of legislation 
 
 
 
 
 
Policy Area I: Governance and institutional arrangements  
The proposed energy policy recommends the establishment of a National Energy 
Coordination Committee (NECC). The NECC should be chaired by the Minister or 
Permanent Secretary responsible for the energy sector and its membership should include 
representatives of the relevant government ministries and agencies. 
The main function of NECC is to coordinate energy planning and monitor policy 
development in the energy sector, including coordinating and monitoring the 
implementation of the National Energy Policy. This includes the aligning of policies and 
activities of all stakeholders with the overall energy policy, reviewing and approving 
planning and policy proposals prepared by the Department of Energy (DoE) and resolving 
any inter-ministry or inter-agency conflicts that may emerge. The NECC would meet at least 
two times annually with DoE being the secretariat.  
There is a need to have a central agency that will be responsible for the implementation and 
the administering of the National Energy Policy. The Department of Energy (DoE) is best 
place to take on this responsibility, and most stakeholders agree with this assessment.  
In the short term, no new primary legislation is needed to establish NECC. All relevant 
government ministries and agencies can continue to perform their roles and functions as per 
the existing laws. For example, Land Transport Authority may continue to perform its 
functions and duties as per the Land Transport Act, while the Department of Environment 
can continue to perform its functions and duties as per the Environmental Management Act. 
The role of NECC is to coordinate these functions and facilitate coherence within the energy 
sector.  
A Cabinet Decree can be enacted to establish NECC and provide DoE with the mandate to 
oversee and coordinate the implementation of the National Energy Policy. The Decree, in 
conjunction with the revised Electricity Act, can also re-allocate the non-tariff regulation of 
the electricity sector from FEA to DoE. This should be sufficient to provide DoE with 
mandate it needed to perform the proposed functions of planning and policy development, 
non-tariff regulation, and monitoring and reporting envisaged in the National Energy 
Policy. 
In the longer term, a new Energy Act can consolidate all energy sector legislation and 
provide a stronger mandate for NECC and DoE.  
If DoE is strengthened through the recruitment of new staff members, the recruitment 
process needs to be consistent with that outlined in the State Services Decree 2009. 
Policy Area II: Grid-based power supply 
The most relevant legislation for this policy area is listed below: 
 
Electricity Act – this is the most important item of legislation. It establishes the 
Fiji Electricity Authority and provides its mandates in terms of power 
generation, operation of transmission and distribution lines, and its regulatory 
functions.  
 
Draft Legislative Gap Analysis

Review of legislation 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commerce Act – this legislation has been superseded by the Commerce 
Commission Decree, which establishes the Commerce Commission and outlines 
its functions, which includes regulating prices of monopolistic industries 
(including electricity and fuel), and reviewing access agreements for 
infrastructure facilities.  
 
Public Enterprise Act – this legislation governs the operations, including 
reporting and accountability, employment and finance, of Government Statutory 
Authorities (GSAs) and Government Commercial Companies (GCCs). FEA is a 
GSA; therefore it is also governed by the provisions of this Act. 
 
Environmental Management Act – this legislation is relevant in that it requires 
consideration for the environment in any infrastructure projects and may require 
an Environmental Impact Assessment for large infrastructure projects, which 
include some electricity generation projects.  
 
Land Conservation and Improvement Act, Native Land Trust Act, and State 
Acquisition Act – these acts govern the use of land in Fiji, and outline the 
procedure to obtain clearance for building infrastructure facilities in Fiji. The 
State Acquisition Act provides that the Government has the right to acquire any 
land in Fiji for public purposes, which include the provision of electricity supply. 
 
Revenue and Customs Authority Act and Foreign Investment Act – these acts 
are relevant for private investment in electricity generation in Fiji. The Foreign 
Investment Act outlines how a foreign company can invest in Fiji, while the 
Revenue and Customs Authority Act establishes the Fiji Islands Revenue and 
Customs Authority that is responsible for administering the Customs Act, 
Customs Tariffs Act, Income Tax Act, Tax Administration Decree and Value 
Added Tax Decree, all of which are relevant to any private investors in Fiji. 
 
Statistics Act – this act allows coordination between the Fiji Bureau of Statistics 
and other government department in terms of data collection. In this case, the 
grid-based electricity statistics can be recorded and published by the Fiji Bureau 
of Statistics to improve transparency in the sector. 
Policy Area III: Rural electrification 
The Rural Electrification Policy was accepted in 1993 and a Cabinet Decision was published 
to implement this policy. The policy establishes the Rural Electrification Unit under the 
Ministry, and gave it the responsibility to administer and control the rural electrification 
program. FEA is also given some responsibility under the policy to undertake rural 
electrification programs. 
There is currently no co-ordinated national plan to complete the electrification programme 
and no comprehensive assessment of the least-cost means of doing so. While grid expansion 
by FEA has traditionally been the main form of electrification, there are also a number of 
diesel-based mini-grids operated by the Public Works Department or community 
cooperatives, and solar home systems maintained by private contractors who receive a 
subsidy from DoE.

Review of legislation 
 
 
 
 
 
In the existing legislative framework, the most relevant legislation is the Electricity Act, in 
that it governs the responsibility and functions of FEA, which include managing and 
operating all transmission grids and supplying electricity to customer within the grid areas.  
Other relevant legislation include the Commerce Commission Decree, as the Commerce 
Commission has the function to regulate electricity tariffs proposed by FEA (including in 
rural areas), the Public Enterprise Act, as it requires FEA as a GSA to develop a corporate 
plan and business plan that should include grid extension plans, and the Statistics Act as it 
allows coordination with Fiji Bureau of Statistics in recording and publishing electrification 
rate in rural areas. 
Policy Area IV: Renewable energy 
The Electricity Act was developed and enacted at the time when renewable energy was not 
a major issue and therefore does not have any specific clauses or even mention electricity 
generation using renewable energy sources. As it is currently being reviewed, the revised 
Electricity Act should include clauses concerning electricity generation using renewable 
sources. 
The Environmental Management Act is also relevant, in that it requires the Department of 
Environment to have a Resource Management Unit, whose function includes the 
formulation of a Natural Resource Inventory, which includes renewable energy sources.  
However, geothermal resources are governed by the Mineral (Exploration and 
Exploitation) Act, and are currently managed by the Mineral Resource Department under 
the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources. There is a plan to amend this Act and in the 
future develop a Geothermal Decree and Regulation1.  
The Land Conservation and Improvement Act, Native Land Trust Act governs the use of 
land in Fiji, which include the use of land for electricity generation using renewable sources. 
The State Acquisition Act provides that the Government has the right to acquire any land in 
Fiji for public purposes, which include the provision of electricity supply. 
In addition, in the Climate Change Policy rests the responsibility of implementing the 
policy and in coordinating climate change related projects to the Climate Change Unit, 
which are currently under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Climate Change Policy 
includes public awareness and education programs in relation to climate change issues, and 
has provisions for climate change mitigation programs, which includes renewable energy 
for electricity generation and other industrial uses. 
Similar to that of promoting private investment in grid-based power supply, in terms of 
promoting private investment in renewable energy generation, the Revenue and Customs 
Authority Act and Foreign Investment Act are relevant. 
The Statistics Act is also relevant in that the Fiji Bureau of Statistics can collect and publish 
information on potential renewable energy sources.

Policy Area V: Transport 
The Ministry of Works, Transport and Public Utilities is currently in the evaluation process 
of selecting consultants to develop the Land and Maritime Transport Policies which is 
expected to be completed in 2014.  
For land transport, the most relevant legislation is the 1998 Land Transport Act, which 
establishes the Land Transport Authority (LTA), and outlines the responsibilities and 
functions of LTA, which include recording and managing the vehicle registration, and 
regulates vehicle standards and set greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for land 
vehicles. The 1998 Act is currently being reviewed in consultation with the Office of the 
Solicitor General. Other regulations in relation to land transport are the responsibilities of 
LTA under this Act. 
For maritime transport, the Maritime Transport Decree 2013 (MTD) and the Ship 
Registration Decree 2013 (SRD) has superseded the 1986 Marine Act and establishes the 
Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji. The MTD outlines the regulation of the safety aspect of 
vessels/ship and protection of the marine environment from any unlawful discharge that 
emanates from ships pipelines and off shore installations. The SRD outlines the regulation of 
vessel registrations and licencing.  
Vehicle importation standards are regulated by Ministry of Industry and Trade, although 
there is no specific legislation allocating this responsibility. The Ministry of Industry and 
Trade issues standards for vehicle imports and issue import certification. The Revenue and 
Customs Authority Act also applies to vehicle importation. 
Policy Area VI: Petroleum and substitute fuels 
In terms of petroleum exploration and production, the governing legislation is the 
Petroleum (Exploration and Exploitation) Act. However, this act does not govern the 
importation of petroleum or other fuel products. Petroleum import prices are monitored by 
the Reserve Bank of Fiji. As with any other good imported into Fiji, the importation of 
petroleum and other fuel products are also governed by the Revenue and Customs 
Authority Act.  
Under the Trade Standards and Quality Control Decree, the Ministry of Industry and 
Trade publishes and monitors the quality standards of imported fuels, while the wholesale 
and retail prices of petroleum and other fuels are regulated by the Commerce Commission 
under the Commerce Commission Decree.  
The Biofuel Development Unit under the DoE has the responsibility to ensure timely 
implementation of biofuel industry in Fiji. However, the national biofuel and ethanol 
standards are governed under the Trade Standards and Quality Control Decree.  
The use of biofuel for electricity generation and land transport, once developed, will have 
relevance to the Electricity Act and Land Transport Act, as both acts can provide incentives 
for the use of biofuel. 
The Fiji Bureau of Statistics collects information on the consumption of petroleum and fuel 
products under the Statistics Act.

Policy Area VII: Energy efficiency 
There is no specific legislation for energy efficiency; most energy efficiency related issues are 
included in sector legislation. For example, in relation to transport, the LTA collects 
information and register vehicles based on their fuel types. 
The use of energy efficient appliances, such as refrigerators, are encourages, and the 
standards for these appliances are govern under the Trade Standards and Quality Control 
Decree along with the Minimum Energy Performance Standards and Labelling Program, 
with the Department of Energy being responsible for regulating the labelling of energy 
efficient appliances. The Revenue and Customs Authority Act provides for customs and tax 
incentives for the importation of energy efficient appliances.  
The Fiji National Building Code is set out as part of the Public Health (National Building 
Code) Regulation 2004, and currently does not have specific clauses for energy efficient 
building requirements. 
The Environmental Management Act has some relevance in that the functions of the 
Department of Environment include improving public awareness and education on 
environmental matters.

Environmental 
Management Act 
2005 
The Environmental Management Act was enacted in 2005 and its objective 
is to apply the principles of sustainable development to the use and 
development of natural and physical resources; and to identify matters of 
national importance for the Fiji Islands.  
Electricity generation projects that has significant 
environmental impacts are required to submit an EIA 
Policy Area III – Renewable energy 
The Act outlines the responsibilities of the Department of Environment, 
which include the formulation of a Natural Resource Inventory, Natural 
Resource Management Plan, and National Environmental Strategy. 
The Natural Resource Inventory includes inventory of 
energy resources. The current inventory includes solar, 
hydro and wind resources as energy resources, and 
geothermal power as mineral resources 
The Act requires environmental impact of development activities that are 
likely to have a significant impact on the environment, including existing 
or proposed protected areas. Infrastructure projects in the energy sector 
are, thus, obliged to submit an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
for approval prior to their implementation.  
Policy Area VI – Energy efficiency 
Part of the responsibility of the Department of 
Environment is to raise public awareness on 
environmental matters, which include the sustainable use 
of natural resources 
 
Policy Area V – Petroleum and substitute fuels 
Petroleum 
(Exploration and 
Exploitation) Act 
(Cap. 148) (revision 
1985) 
The Petroleum Act was enacted in 1978 and was revised in 1985.The Act 
sets out definitions, financial provisions, keeping of records and accounts, 
data provision and confidentiality, rights reserved by Government and 
various obligations of the company. 
The Act outlines the procedure for exploration and 
exploitation and who holds the ownership and rights.  
 
The Act is concerned with the laying of pipelines (development is 
administered under the Petroleum (Exploration and Exploitation) Act). 
Under the Petroleum Act, the Minister has largely unfettered power to 
permit the construction of pipelines for conveying petroleum in, on or 
under any public or private land, and imposing conditions thereupon. 
Under regulations, the release of oil from vessels and associated 
infrastructure into the sea is prohibited. In terms of onshore oil pollution, a 
$100 fine applies in respect of the escape of petroleum which may 
percolate to the sea, stream or river.

Policy Area I – Grid-based power supply 
Commerce Act 
(1998) superseded 
by Commerce 
Commission Decree 
2010 
The Act was enacted in 1998 and resulted in the establishment of a four 
member Commerce Commission in October of the same year. The 
Commission was dissolved by the Fiji Labour Party government in 1999. A 
new Commission was appointed in October 2000 by the then interim 
government. The Commerce Commission Decree was enacted in 2010, and 
it repeals the Commerce Act. 
The Commission is responsible for registering an access 
agreement to any infrastructure facility, which include any 
contracts FEA has with other power producers 
The Commerce Commission also reviews FEA proposed 
tariffs and sets and publishes customers electricity tariffs 
The object of the Commission, as outlined in the Act is to (i) to promote 
effective competition in the interests of consumers; (ii) to facilitate an 
approximate balance between efficiency and environmental and social 
considerations; (iii) to ensure non-discriminatory access to monopoly and 
near monopoly infrastructure or services.  
Policy Area V – Petroleum and substitute fuels 
The Commerce Commission sets wholesale and retail fuel 
prices 
The Act also outlines the procedure for entering into an access agreement 
in relation to infrastructure facilities and how prices of goods and services 
can be controlled in case of restricted competition. In case of restricted 
competition in the energy sector, the relevant Minister can impose price 
control. 
Policy Area I – Grid-based power supply 
Public Enterprise 
Act 1996 
The Public Enterprise Act was enacted in 1996 and was revised in 2002. 
The Act established the Public Enterprises Reform Program 
FEA is a Government Statutory Authority, and therefore 
governed by this Act. 
The reform aimed at improving the overall operational and allocative 
efficiency of the public enterprises. This entailed the re-organisation of 
commercial sections of the Government Statutory Authorities (GSAs) and 
Government Commercial Companies (GCCs) through corporatisation and 
privatisation.  
The Act (1996) requires each GCCs and GSA's to submit a 
Corporate Plan with specification on (i) statement of 
corporate intent; (ii) employment and industrial relations 
plan; (iii) unaudited financial statements, annual reports 
and; (iv) an annual budget. Additionally, the Ministry of 
Enterprises nominates an observer to ensure that the 
ministry is informed of the activities and operations of the 
organisation concerned. 
The re-organised and corporatised government entities were to operate as 
successful businesses through the application of four key principles 
embodied in the Public Enterprise Act. These principles were (i) clarity of 
objectives of the public enterprise; (ii) management of autonomy and 
authority to pursue these objectives; (iii) strict accountability for 
performance by the board; and (iv) a level playing field through creation 
of a competitive and fair trading environment. 
Under the Act, Each GCC and GSA is required to pay at 
least 50 per cent of net earnings (after tax) to Government 
as dividends

Land Conservation 
and Improvement 
Act (Cap. 141) 1953 
Establishes the Land Conservation Board and empowers the board to 
make conservation, closing and work orders. 
The Land Conservation Board appointed under this Act 
has wide powers and can require an owner or occupier of 
any land to construct and maintain on the land such works 
for the conservation of the land or water resources and that 
includes infrastructure facilities in the energy sector.  
Policy Area I – Grid-based power supply 
Native Land Trust 
Act (Cap. 134) 
(revision 1985) and 
Crowns Land Act 
(Cap. 132)  
The Native Land Trust Act (NLTA) revised in 1985, called for the 
establishment of the Native Land Trust Board (NLTB).The Act transfers all 
land rights from the mataqalis’ to the NLTB. Under the Act, all native land 
is vested in the Board to be administered by the Board for the benefit of 
the Fijian owners. NLTB is the legal owner of all native land in Fiji, despite 
landowners acting as owners. 
The Act provides a provision to create a conservation 
covenant with landowners, which would place restriction 
on the use or development of land. If an infrastructure 
facility is located on native land it is subject to the NLTA.  
 
The Act provides that the Trust Council may, with the approval of the 
Minister, declare any area of land (including reefs) as being of natural 
interest or beauty. Such an area of land or reef would be listed as a 
National Heritage Area. 
The NLTB is lawfully authorised to grant leases of portions of native land, 
which are not included in the native reserves. The customary owners have 
no choice as regards NLTB being the Legal owner (trustee) of their land.

State Acquisition of 
Land Act (Cap. 135) 
1978 
Under this Act the state is empowered to acquire any lands in Fiji for 
public purposes – an explanation of the relationship between this Act and 
the Native Land Trust Act is needed. 
The Act provides for the compulsory acquisition of land 
for public purposes.Public purposes include defense, town 
and country planning, and general public benefit.  
The Act provides the right to the relevant Minister during the period 
before a town planning scheme has been approved, to compulsorily 
acquire land. The test to be applied is where a town council is satisfied that 
the acquisition of any land under this section is expedient for the purpose 
which appears to it to be necessary in the interests of the proper planning 
of that area.

Focus on key legislation 
In this section we give a detailed review of five pieces of legislation that we have identified 
as being most critical to governance of the energy sector and has the most relevance to the 
implementation of the NEP: 
 
The Electricity Act 
 
The Land Transport Act 
 
The Environmental Management Act 
 
Commerce Commission Decree (repeals the Commerce Act) 
  Minerals (Exploration and Exploitation) Bill 
Other relevant legislation has been summarised in Table 2, and although they are relevant to 
the implementation of the new National Energy Policy, they do not have immediate impact 
on the implementation of the National Energy Policy. These legislation have been identified 
in order to provide a wide view of the legislative framework concerning the energy sector. 
Furthermore, the identified relevant legislation will not impede and some will even assists 
in the implementation of the National Energy Policy. 
Electricity Act 
The main purpose of the Electricity Act is to establish the Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA). 
Under this Act, the board members of FEA are appointed by the Minister responsible for 
energy2 and the terms are also determined by the Minister. The board then appoints a 
General Manager and a Secretary with the approval of the Minister. Other staff members of 
FEA can be recruited from the market based on qualifications and experience and FEA may 
develop its own regulations in terms of staff recruitment and remunerations.  
The functions and duties of FEA are outlined in Articles 13, 15, 28, and 66 of the Electricity 
Act. Based on these articles, the functions and duties of FEA can be categorised and 
summarised as follows: 
  Manage and operate all electrical installations transferred from the 
Government – FEA has the right to generate, transmit, transform and distribute 
electricity, and operate and manage the assets involved in these activities 
 
Supply electricity to consumers – FEA is required to enter into a supply contract 
with individuals or companies to sell electricity as per the terms and conditions 
of the contract. FEA is not allowed to supply electricity to an area licenced to be 
supplied by a licencee 
                                                      
2 Formerly the Minister for Lands, Energy and Mineral Resources, now the Minister for Works, Transport and 
Public Utilities (Energy and Water)

 
Issue and grant licences for the supply and operation of an electrical 
installation3 – FEA has the right to determine the amount of licence fee, the 
licence conditions, and licence term (with a maximum of 21 years). Licences 
must include a map of the supply area and declare the voltage permitted and its 
allowable variations. FEA has the right to cancel licences if any of the conditions 
are breached. The Electricity Act does not explicitly include grounds on which 
FEA can refuse to grant a licence. However, the Act allows FEA to make 
regulations on the conditions to be met by licence applicants, and the conditions 
for suspension, extension and revocation of licences. In addition to licences, FEA 
also grants certificate of registration of all new electrical installations and charges 
a registration fee.  
 
Technical regulation – For the electricity sector, FEA may make regulations and 
develop technical standards and specifications, determine duties inspectors and 
procedures for inspections, develop and determine public enquiries and notice 
procedures, and develop and determine payments and collection methods. 
 
Tariff setting – Since the Electricity Act was enacted prior to the enactment of 
the Commerce Commission Decree, some of its provisions regarding tariff 
setting may be outdated and in need of revision to ensure consistency with the 
Commerce Commission Decree. According to the existing Electricity Act, FEA 
may make regulations in relation to the charges made for supplied electricity 
and charges to cover the cost connecting a customer to the distribution line. FEA 
may also set the maximum tariff that can be charged to customers.  
It is important to note that Article 14 of the Electricity Act allows for the Minister responsible 
for energy to give directives to FEA in relation to its functions and duties. This gives the 
Minister the ability to provide policy direction and targets that FEA has to meet in 
performing its duties and functions. 
The Electricity Act provides for the financial management of FEA in Article 18-25, in that 
FEA may charge fees in order to finance its operations, may borrow from financial 
institutions, and may invest its revenues. FEA is also required to submit an annual report, 
which includes audited financial statements, to the Minister. A copy of the annual report 
will also be laid before Parliament.  
Another Article worth noting is Article 33, which gives FEA the right to require licensees of 
selected power stations to supply electricity to the grid. In doing so, FEA may require the 
licencee to upgrade and modify its systems in order to supply FEA with the amount of 
electricity required. The price for electricity supplied in this case should be determined by 
arbitration. The Electricity Act does not specify who should be the arbitrator, and currently 
this function is performed by the Commerce Commission.  
The Electricity Act also provides for FEA’s rights to acquire land and/or property needed to 
provide electricity supply and rights to enter property or land for inspections. It also defines 
types of offences and their respective penalties and FEA’s rights to penalise offenders. 
                                                      
3 Installation is defined in the Act as “whole of any plant or apparatus designed for the supply or use or both of 
energy”. This includes installations that are used to generate and transport electricity.

Other aspects covered by the Electricity Act include the use or joint use of transmission lines, 
disconnections for maintenance purposes, procedures to investigate accidents, and some 
dispute resolution mechanism. 
Land Transport Act 
The Land Transport Act was enacted to establish the Land Transport Authority, to regulate 
the registration and use of vehicles, the licencing of drivers of vehicles and the enforcement 
of traffic laws. 
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is responsible for the registration of land transport 
vehicles, licencing of drivers licence for land transport vehicles, to develop and implement 
traffic management strategies and practices, and develop and implement enforcement 
strategies in consultation with the Commissioner of Police consistent with road safety and 
road infrastructure protection objectives. 
The Land Transport Act provides that the Minister, after consultation with the LTA may 
make regulations under the Act, which will be implemented and monitored by LTA. In 
relation to energy and to the proposed energy policies, these regulations under LTA include: 
  Minimum vehicle standards relative to road safety and the environment 
 
Standards for the construction, dimension and weights of vehicles and the 
environmental and safety standards to be met by vehicles 
 
The type and standards of fuel and fuel systems to be used by motor vehicles 
and emission standards for motor vehicles 
 
The safety of hazardous materials, including petroleum products, gases, 
chemicals and explosives, being transported by road. 
As part of the vehicle registration process, LTA collects information on registered vehicles 
such as fuel type, year of make, and other information that can be used to determine 
vehicles’ energy efficiency.  
Environmental Management Act 
The Environmental Management Act was enacted for the protection of the natural resources 
and for the control and management of developments, waste management and pollution 
control, and for the establishment of a National Environment Council. 
The National Environmental Council has the functions of approving the National State of 
the Environment Report (National Report) and the National Environmental Strategy, 
monitoring the implementation of the National Environmental Strategy, advice the 
Government on international and regional environmental commitments and treaties, and in 
general facilitates discussions on environmental matters.  
The Environmental Management Act allows the Council to require the Department of 
Environment to become the coordinating department in terms of matters relating to the 
environment. The Department is required to create several units with distinct functions:

 
Resource Management Unit – responsible for the formulation and review of the 
National Resource Inventory and the Natural Resource Management Plan, 
maintaining a natural resource information database and in general all matters 
relating to natural resources in Fiji. 
 
Environmental Impact Assessment Unit – responsible for examining and 
processing development proposals, and for implementing the EIA procedures 
  Waste Management and Pollution Control Unit – responsible for the 
formulation of the National Solid Waste Management Strategy and in general all 
matters relating to the waste management and pollution control. 
The Environmental Management Act requires the formulation and development of a 
Natural Resource Inventory, which includes inventory of all Fiji’s natural resources 
classified into six categories: freshwater resources, marine resources, land resources, 
agriculture resources, energy resources and mineral resources. The formulation of the 
Natural Resource Inventory should be followed by the formulation of the National Resource 
Management Plan. Later on both of these documents should inform and be the basis for the 
National Environmental Strategy.  
The first Natural Resource Inventory for Fiji was published in 2011 containing six volumes, 
one for each of the resource categories. Volume 5 (Energy Resources) of the Natural 
Resource Inventory includes solar, hydro and wind energy resources, while Volume 6 
(Mineral Resources) includes geothermal energy sources.  
The National Resource Management Plan and the National Environmental Strategy have not 
been published at the time this report was written.  
Commerce Commission Decree 
The Commerce Commission Decree repeals the Commerce Act, and provides a more up to 
date and comprehensive law concerning regulated industries and provides for consumer 
protection. As with the Commerce Act, the Commerce Commission Decree establishes the 
Commerce Commission, and outlines its functions and duties, which can be categorised as 
follows 
  Access agreements – the Commerce Commission provides advice to the Minister 
for Industry and Trade about proposed access agreements, maintains a register 
of access agreements, facilitates negotiations about access to infrastructure or 
services under access regimes, and arbitrates disputes over access to 
infrastructure or services under access regimes 
 
Control of Prices – the Commerce Commission may fix and declare maximum 
prices, and where need be, quantities, for goods and services and rents. The 
Commerce Commission Decree empowers the Commission to recommend to the 
Minister to make a statutory order to control prices in the industries where 
competition is limited or is likely to be lessened and where it is necessary or 
desirable that the price of this good or service be controlled in the interests of 
users, consumers or suppliers. Where a statutory order is enforced, the 
Commission is empowered to set the new prices.

 
Consumer protection – the Commerce Commission has the responsibility to 
promote the interests of consumers, to collect, examine and disseminate 
information in respects of matters affecting consumers, to receive and consider 
complaints from consumers, to provide advice to consumers and manufactures 
or suppliers, and to investigate fraudulent or deceptive practices in relation to 
matters that affects consumer interests. 
Under the Commerce (Control of Prices for Supply of Electricity and Ancillary Services) 
Order 2012, the Commerce Commission is empowered to control and/or regulate the prices 
for electricity and ancillary services in Fiji. This includes the control of prices for the supply 
of electricity in all quantities, qualities and grades or classes, which entails that the 
Commerce Commission can also set the minimum price FEA may offer to Independent 
Power Producers (IPPs). In December 2012, the minimum IPP tariff rate was set to 25.65 
Fijian cents. 
The Commerce Commission Decree also gives powers to the Commerce Commission, with 
the Minister for Industry and Trade’s approval, to make Petroleum Price Control Order. 
Under the Commerce (Price Control) (Petroleum Prices) Order, the Commerce Commission 
determines the maximum prices for the sale of petroleum products, including motor spirits 
(unleaded), gasoil (diesoline), pre-mixed outboard fuel, kerosene for household use, and 
liquid petroleum gas (LPG).  
Mineral (Exploration and Exploitation) Bill 
The Mineral (Exploration and Exploitation) Bill states that all mineral resources, including 
geothermal resources, in or under any land in Fiji are and deemed to be the property of the 
State, and no person are allowed to carry out any activities involving the prospecting, 
exploration and development of minerals without a relevant licence. 
There are different types of licences prescribed by the Bill: 
 
Prospector’s rights – gives a person the right to prospect for minerals and mark 
out areas of proposed mining lease 
 
Exploration licence – gives the holder the right to explore the area specified in 
the licence and mark out and apply for development licence or mining lease  
  Development licence – gives the holder the right to develop the area specified in 
the licence and apply for mining lease or to retain the mineral resources within 
the area specified in the licence 
  Mining lease – allows the holder to perform mining activities within the area 
specified in the lease. 
For each of these types of licences, the Mineral Bill outlines the application process, criteria 
for granting the licence, and the terms, conditions and statutory requirements attached to 
the licences. 
The Bill also include provisions for compensations paid for land, cultural and external 
disruptions, royalty payments to the government from development licence holders and 
mining lease holders, and health and safety requirements for any mining activities.

3  Analysis of legislative gaps 
Based on our review of relevant legislation in the previous section, the gaps in existing 
legislation that can impede the implementation of the proposed National Energy Policy are 
identified and discussed below.  
3.1 
Lack of coordination in energy sector planning and policy 
development 
None of the relevant laws provide for a central policy-making and planning entity for the 
energy sector or other means of coordination. Different legislation allocates responsibilities 
related to the energy sector to different government departments and/or other institutions, 
as summarised in Table 3. This lack of coordination contributes to a disjointed policy 
making process and unreliable implementation of policies.

The table above also shows that currently the Department of Energy does not have a legal 
mandate to implement the policies and programs entrusted in them.  
3.2 
Outdated and incomplete Electricity Act 
The main legislative gap with respect to grid-based power supply, rural electrification, and 
renewable energy is the Electricity Act; more specifically: 
 
Inappropriate regulatory framework in the electricity sector– in the current 
arrangement under the Electricity Act, FEA is performing the regulatory 
function as well as being the service provider. This creates obvious potential for 
conflicts of interest, particularly as the National Energy Policy calls for the 
opening up of the power sector to greater involvement from entities other than 
FEA.  
  Outdated provisions regarding tariff setting –the Commerce Commission is 
currently performing some of the economic regulation functions, such as tariff 
reviews. The existing Electricity Act does not require FEA to sign a multi-year 
regulatory contract with the Commerce Commission, nor does it require FEA to 
comply with regulations made by the Commerce Commission. 
  Unclear arrangement for supply into the electricity grid – although there are 
provisions for the sale of electricity to FEA, there are no specific requirement for 
this arrangement. For example, there are no requirements for FEA and the 
licenced supplier to enter into a supply contract or power purchase agreements 
(PPAs). 
  No provisions for rural electrification – the existing Electricity Act does not 
specifically address rural electrification. It also does not have clear provisions for 
off-grid electricity supply. This may hinder, for example, the proposed 
introduction of new rural electrification providers and a subsidy mechanism and 
efforts to make FEA comply with the proposed national electrification plan. 
  No provisions for renewable energy development - although FEA are actively 
pursuing renewable energy development, in the existing Electricity Act there is a 
lack of obligations on FEA to promote and support renewable energy including, 
for example, obligations to connect to and purchase from qualifying facilities.

3.3 
Lack of incentives for private investors 
In terms of encouraging private sector investment in the electricity sector, the existing 
legislation, including Revenue and Customs Authority Act and Foreign Investment Act, are 
adequate and no changes are needed. However, there is a lack of clarity on how the 
electricity sector, in particular tariff setting and contracting, is regulated. This lack of clarity 
is a major constraint in increasing private investment in the electricity sector.  
In addition, there is currently no one-stop-shop to assist investors. Investment Fiji has made 
a good start in developing and providing guidelines on energy related investments in Fiji. 
However, the procedure for investing in energy projects in Fiji is still very complicated, with 
many different institutions to seek approvals from. The situation as regards land access 
permits is particularly complex. The Land Conservation and Improvement Act and the 
Native Land Trust Act both govern the use of land for infrastructure projects. It is very 
difficult for private investors, especially foreign private investors, to work through the 
various pieces of legislation, as has been reported by several private sector participants to 
the National Energy Forum. 
While this does not necessitate new primary legislation, it does suggest that coordination 
between DoE, with the lead planning role in the sector and the responsibility for housing all 
energy related information, and Investment Fiji, with a role as a one-stop shop, could 
drastically support private investment in the energy (and other) sectors.

4  Recommended legislative changes 
Implementing new primary legislation takes time. This is particularly so where it involves 
creating new agencies or expanding the powers of existing agencies which, inevitably, will 
lead to concerns among existing agencies who fear losing out. In making our 
recommendations on how to address legislative gaps we have been conscious of this risk 
and the need to avoid making implementation of the NEP as a whole dependent on the 
passage of new legislation which may be subject to many delays. 
We have, therefore, adopted a two-step process in our recommendations: 
 
Initially, the NEP will be implemented as far as possible through the existing 
legal powers of the concerned agencies. Primary legislative activity is limited to 
the most urgent amendments to existing legislation without which key parts of 
the NEP would fail. 
 
The institutional and legal reforms needed to fully implement the NEP will be 
embedded at a later stage through new primary legislation, with adequate time 
allowed for this to be enacted. Implementation of the NEP is not dependent on 
the passage of this legislation. However, it is necessary to ensure that measures 
under the NEP are sustained and to remove the risk of rapid reversal or change 
which would introduce uncertainty and risk private investment in particular. 
Primary legislation requires the approval of the parliament, while secondary legislation such 
as regulations and cabinet orders can be enacted by the executive branch of Government. In 
general, the process to enact primary legislation can be lengthy and is prone to delays due to 
political issues. Therefore, when time is an important factor, the enactment of secondary 
legislation is preferred and can be a starting point to further enactment of primary 
legislation.  
As well as supporting the rapid implementation of the NEP, this two-step process has the 
advantages that it allows time to build consensus around the institutional reforms required 
and to pilot aspects of the NEP with the resulting lessons learned incorporated into the final 
legislation. 
4.1 
Initial changes  
Below we identify four types of initial legislative changes to be undertaken: 
  A new Cabinet Decision or Decree to establish the NECC and empower DoE. 
 
The revision of the Electricity Act. 
 
Enactment of secondary legislation/regulations. 
 
Changes to existing policy documents and regulations. 
These are discussed in detail below.

Recommended legislative changes 
 
 
 
 
 
New Cabinet Decision or Decree to establish the NECC and empower DoE 
No new primary legislation is needed to establish NECC, as the membership of NECC only 
includes already existing institutions, as shown in Figure 1 below. Therefore, a Cabinet 
Decision or Decree is sufficient to establish NECC, and provides for its mandates, functions 
and operations. The Cabinet Order should also specify which relevant government 
ministries and agencies should be members of NECC, while the Secretariat of NECC should 
be under the Department of Energy. 
At a minimum, the institutions/departments identified in Table 3 as being responsible for 
various areas of the energy sector should be represented in NECC. 
Figure 1 National Energy Policy implementation institutional arrangements 
 
Source: Fiji National Energy Policy, October 2013 
As the Secretariat of NECC, DoE’s mandate to perform its functions as described in the new 
National Energy Policy can be included in the Cabinet Order. This will strengthened DoE’s 
position as the main department responsible for the implementation of the new energy 
policy.  
Revision of the Electricity Act 
It is acknowledged that there is on-going work in reviewing and revising the existing 
Electricity Act. As we do not have a copy of the proposed revision of the Electricity Act, it is 
advised that the changes and revision proposed in this section should be made in 
conjunction with the on-going work.  
To accommodate the implementation of the new energy policy, additional changes to the 
Electricity Act can be made to allow for: 
 
Removal of conflicts of interest in regulation – Technical regulatory functions 
should be removed from FEA and transferred to a new agency or unit under 
DoE. This includes the issuance of licences to operate electrical installation that is 
currently FEA’s responsibility. 
 
Draft Legislative Gap Analysis 
34  
 
Recommended legislative changes 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Put in place provisions for a regulatory contract – The Commerce Commission 
will remain responsible for economic regulation. However, it should be given 
powers to implement these responsibilities through a multi-year regulatory 
contract or similar instrument.  
  Define planning responsibilities - DoE will be responsible for the rural 
electrification and national electrification master plans, and the power 
development and asset management plans prepared by FEA will be expected to 
comply with these. The amended Act should also allow DoE to enact secondary 
legislation (regulations) to cover specific topics in relation to the implementation 
of the NEP 
  Development and implementation of IPP framework – DoE will be responsible 
for developing the IPP framework, with FEA as the main implementing agency. 
The IPP framework will include competitive procurement process that FEA has 
to follow. 
In the short term, we propose that these changes are enacted in the form of amendments to 
that Act rather than as a new Act. The required legislation would, therefore, amend specific 
sections of the Electricity Act or add new or delete existing sections 
Enactment of new secondary legislation/regulations 
Secondary legislation or regulations can be enacted to accompany and supplement the 
revised Electricity Act in the implementation of the National Energy Policy. DoE will be 
responsible for developing and publishing (following the approval from NECC) the 
following regulations:  
 
IPP framework regulation – this regulation will provide guidelines on 
competitive procurement process for IPPs and principles to be applied in all 
power purchase agreements. The regulation should require FEA to follow the 
competitive procurement process, and have the negotiated power purchase 
agreement approved by DoE and the Commerce Commission.  
 
Feed-in tariffs and net metering regulation – this regulation will built on the 
current feed-in tariff mechanisms set by the Commerce Commission, and will 
distinguish between technologies or size of generation. The regulation will 
outline the feed-in tariff calculations and procedures for the implementation of 
net metering schemes.  
 
Electrification fund regulation –This will open up opportunities for new 
providers in rural electrification and improving the certainty of cost-recovery for 
rural electrification by replacing the current budgetary allocations with a rural 
electrification fund able to commit to multi-year support. 
 
Renewable energy technology standards – outlines the renewable energy 
technology standards in use or likely to be used in Fiji. 
 
Energy Service Company (ESCO) regulation – his regulation should govern the 
establishment of ESCOs and how arrangements should be made to share energy

savings between projects and ESCOs. This regulation should be based on pilot or 
public sector demonstration project. 
In the transport sector, the Land Transport Authority, with the approval from NECC, should 
develop and publish: 
  Vehicle fuel efficiency standards and labelling regulation – this regulation will 
provide standards for vehicle fuel efficiency standards for imported vehicles, 
and provide for the procedure and application of labelling of imported vehicles 
in terms of fuel efficiency. 
In terms of petroleum and alternative fuel regulation, DoE should coordinate with the 
relevant department in the Ministry of Industry and Trade, to develop and publish (with 
NECC approval): 
 
Petroleum and alternative fuel data release regulation – this regulation will 
require suppliers and retailers of petroleum products to provide information to 
the DoE with regards to fuel quality. The regulation should also refer to the fuel 
quality standards, be it petroleum standards or biofuel and ethanol quality 
standards, and that all supplier and retailers must comply with the relevant 
standards. 
Changes to existing policy documents and regulations 
In addition to the changes in existing legislation, there are other government issued 
documents and regulations that will need to be amended to accommodate the 
implementation of the NEP, including: 
  Department of Transport’s land and maritime policies – the land and maritime 
policies will need to be reviewed and updated to incorporate the new targets set 
out in NEP. A national Transport Policy should be developed in accordance with 
the NEP, which should include the promotions of public transport, cycling and 
cycle paths, and energy aspects of town planning. 
 
Commerce Commission’s fuel pricing template – this should include a more 
transparent calculation process to determine retail fuel prices. 
 
Fiji Tax and Customs Incentive Brochure – this brochure, published by the Fiji 
Revenue and Custom Authority, need to be updated to include any tax and 
customs incentives for energy efficient vehicles or appliances, or any renewable 
energy technologies. 
 
Public Health (National Building Code) Regulation -this regulation should be 
reviewed and amended to include provisions for energy efficiency measures in 
buildings.

4.2 
Longer-term legislative changes 
In the longer term, we recommend that a new and comprehensive Energy Act be enacted. It 
will act as an overarching primary legislation that governs the energy sector with the main 
objectives of: 
 
Consolidating the various legislation in the energy sector. 
 
Expanding the functions and responsibilities of DoE. 
 
Providing primary legislative background to energy sector coordination. 
 
Confirming and providing primary legislative background to the actions that are 
already being undertaken as part of the initial changes. 
The Energy Act should cover all policy areas in the NEP, including, at a minimum, the 
following provisions: 
 
The establishment of NECC, its objectives, functions, memberships and 
operating procedures such as bi-annual meetings and quorum 
 
Specific mandates for DoE, such as its responsibilities as the Secretariat of 
NECC, its planning and policy development functions as proposed in the new 
National Energy Policy 
 
Reporting, monitoring and evaluation requirements to be followed by DoE, 
and any other relevant key actors in relation to the implementation of the NEP 
 
Establishment of the National Energy Consultative Forum (NECF), its 
objectives, functions, memberships and operating procedures 
 
Clear allocation of the regulatory functions in the electricity sector, with DoE 
responsible for technical regulation and the Commerce Commission responsible 
for tariff regulation 
 
IPP framework, based on the experience of implementing the IPP framework 
regulation, allocating the responsibility of procuring IPPs to FEA, the approvals 
of PPAs by DoE and Commerce Commission 
 
Provisions for rural electrification and allocation of responsibility to DoE, who 
will have the power to enact regulation concerning rural electrification, such as 
feed-in tariffs and net metering, with the approval from NECC. DoE may also set 
rural electrification targets and whether this should be met through grid-
extension or other systems.  
 
Provisions for renewable energy sources inventory and allocation of the 
responsibility to update and maintain this inventory to DoE. DoE will have the 
power to enact regulation on renewable energy technology standards and be 
responsible to monitor compliance with the standards.

Recommended legislative changes 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Provisions for energy efficient transport policies, which include references to 
relevant Acts, such as the Land Transport Act, Maritime Transport Act and Ship 
Registration Act, and allocate responsibilities to the Land Transport Authority 
for the development and enactment of energy efficient and fuel efficient vehicle 
standards. The Energy Act should also clearly allocate the responsibility of 
developing and monitoring a national transport policy to the Department of 
Transport. 
 
Provisions for data collection on petroleum product quality, usage, and prices, 
and confirming the Commerce Commission’s responsibility of regulating fuel 
prices. The Energy Act should require all suppliers and retailers to provide 
information to DoE according to the Petroleum and Alternative Fuel Data 
Release Regulation. 
 
Provisions for biofuel research activities and the regulation of the usage and 
sale of biofuel products, and allocate the responsibility of biofuel development to 
DoE, which include the development and monitoring of biofuel and ethanol 
quality standards 
 
Provisions for energy efficiency measures and allocate responsibility of the 
development and monitoring of energy efficiency measures to DoE. This may 
include the development of energy efficiency standards and labelling for 
appliances, revision of the National Building Code, and the establishment of 
ESCOs.  
 
Reference other relevant legislation and other relevant government 
documents. 
The enactment of the Energy Act does not necessary mean that the Electricity Act should be 
repealed. The changes recommended for the Electricity Act are in general in accordance to 
the provisions in the Energy Act, and therefore the two acts can be complementary. This also 
applies to other existing legislation relevant to the energy sector, such as the Land Transport 
Act, Environmental Management Act and others discussed previously. The Energy Act 
should make clear references to existing legislation. 
We recommend that this legislative gap analysis be reviewed and updated towards the end 
of this NEP period (2014-2020), with the objective of further defining the content of the 
Energy Act, based on progress made with respect to the recommended initial legislative 
changes.
