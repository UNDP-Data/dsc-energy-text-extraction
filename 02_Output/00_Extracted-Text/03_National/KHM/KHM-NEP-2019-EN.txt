FOREWORD
Cambodia has experienced high economic growth over the past 5 years and, according to 
the economic experts, this trend will continue at least to 2020 and beyond. In this regard, 
Cambodia’s  energy  consumption  could  increase  significantly.  Following  the  publication 
of Cambodia National Energy Statistics 2016 with technical support from the Economic 
Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA), the Ministry of Mines and Energy 
(MEE) has benefitted greatly from the energy data and statistics as a foundation for its 
energy policy planning and policies. However, the MEE needs further support from ERIA 
to formulate policy targets with regard to energy use in all sectors and to improve energy 
security in the country. Thus, the Ministry identifies the urgent need for the Cambodia 
Basic  Energy  Plan  as  it  will  lay  out  targets  and  policy  recommendations  on  oil  and 
petroleum production and consumption, electricity demand, renewable energy, energy 
efficiency, energy security, and predicted future energy demand and supply. To achieve 
energy policy targets in the medium term as well as understand the policy implications for 
energy security in the long term, there is a need for concrete programmes and action plans 
for energy use and supply. Thus, the MME needs an appropriate and comprehensive basic 
energy plan to achieve its energy policy targets and planning. 
The Cambodia Basic Energy Plan aims to set numerical targets for each energy issue covered 
by the plan, and the targets should be achievable. The basic objective of the plan is to seek 
an energy supply for Cambodia with the following conditions: affordability, accessibility, 
security (sustainable security), safety, and transparency in the energy market.
The Ministry made a request to ERIA to support the MME in setting up the basic energy 
plan. In response, ERIA kindly accepted the offer and in March 2018, formed a project 
team consisting of international experts to work in collaboration with staff from the General 
Department of Energy and General Department of Petroleum. During the project period, 
ERIA also conducted capacity-building training, such as on building a basic understanding 
of energy data and statistics.
Lastly,  the  MME  would  like  to  express  its  appreciation  to  ERIA  for  its  technical  and 
financial support for publishing the Cambodia Basic Energy Plan.

SUMMARY
Background
During 2010–2016, the total primary energy supply (TPES) saw an increase similar to that 
of gross domestic product (GDP) in Cambodia, but the TPES without biomass increased 
by 2.0 times and was much higher than GDP (1.5 times) in the same period (Figure 1). 
Curbing coal, oil, and electricity demand to the GDP level is crucial (Figure 2). Cambodia 
has  increased  its  imports  of  coal  and  petroleum  from  other  ASEAN  countries  such  as 
Indonesia and Singapore and this has affected Cambodian economic growth due to the 
following defined formula of GDP:
GDP = C + I + J + E – M
C: Private consumption + government consumption
I: Private capital formation + government capital formation
J: Stock change
E: Export
M: Import 
 
Consequently,  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Energy  (MME)  needs  an  appropriate  and 
comprehensive basic energy plan, and the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and 
East Asia (ERIA) is supporting the MME to set up this plan. The basic energy plan should 
contribute  two  points:  (a)  saving  conventional  energy  consumption,  such  as  oil  and 
electricity; and (b) utilising domestic energy, such as hydropower and biomass.

Objective
ERIA  and  the  MME  will  prepare  a  Basic  Energy  Plan  for  Cambodia  (BEPC)  that  is 
appropriate,  comprehensive,  feasible,  and  effective.  In  addition,  the  basic  plan  should 
have numerical targets for each energy issue covered by the plan, and the targets should 
be achievable. 
Basic principle
The basic principle of the plan aims for an energy supply for Cambodia with the following 
conditions:
•  Affordability
•  Accessibility
•  Security (sustainable security)
•  Safety
•  Transparency of the market
The catchphrase of the plan is 2A2S+T. In other words, the Cambodian energy policies 
described in the BEPC would contribute to an energy supply in the Cambodian market 
with affordability, accessibility, security, and safety + transparency. The target year of the 
plan is 2030, and the plan applies a rolling-plan method that will be reviewed every five 
years.
Energy issues covered by the BEPC
Recognising the current energy issues in Cambodia, the basic plan covers the following six 
energy fields: (i) oil, (ii) electricity supply, (iii) renewable energy, (iv) energy efficiency, 
(v) energy security, and (vi) the energy outlook brought by the BEPC.
Methodology
Each energy field applies a common approach:
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
Extract the current issues.
Set the appropriate targets for solving the issues.
List the necessary action plans, polices, and roadmaps for achieving the targets.
XVII
Oil supply
In  Cambodia,  gasoline,  diesel  oil,  and  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG)  demand  has 
been increasing rapidly, and the demand has depended on imports. Also, according to 
Cambodia’s energy outlook, which is a part of the East Asia Summit (EAS) energy outlook 
prepared by ERIA, these petroleum products will increase their demand continuously up 
to 2040. In this regard, the following countermeasures are recommended:
(1)  The major use of gasoline and diesel oil as well as LPG is transportation (vehicle), 
so  that  Cambodia  can  shift  to  highly  efficient  vehicles  under  the  appropriate 
regulations (reduction by 10% from the business-as-usual [BAU] scenario).
Petroleum  products  are  convenient  and  useful,  and  they  are  used  across  the 
industry,  transport,  residential,  and  commercial  sectors.  If  a  petroleum  supply 
disruption occurs, Cambodia will face serious damage on both the economic and 
social aspects. Therefore, appropriate stockpiling volumes, including commercial 
stocks, will be needed (at least 30 days until 2030).
(2) 
(3)  Biofuel,  especially  bioethanol,  is  one  of  the  options  for  reducing  imports  of 
gasoline. In addition, biofuel affects the economic growth of Cambodia, such as 
through agriculture and industry activities and reductions in CO2 emissions. The 
General Department of Petroleum is seeking business opportunities for biofuel (E3 
gasoline will be possible by 2025).
(4)  The  BEPC  also  states  that  the  petroleum  supply  chain  will  be  resilient  through 
business activities under the appropriate petroleum policies and regulations.
Electricity supply
Electricity  demand  increased  significantly  by  18%  per  year  during  2010–2016,  and, 
in parallel, power generation increased by 19% per year in the same period. Previously, 
Cambodia  fully  depended  on  oil  power  generation  and  imports  from  neighbouring 
countries,  but  since  coal  and  hydropower  generation  has  increased  rapidly,  imports  of 
electricity have largely decreased compared to 2010. The Cambodia energy outlook also 
reports that its electricity demand will increase by 7.5 times from 2015 to 2040. Based on 
this situation, the BEPC recommends the following countermeasures:
(1)  The power generation mix in 2030 will be coal (35%), hydro (55%), and renewable 
energy (10%), consisting of biomass and solar/photovoltaics (PV). This mix will 
maintain affordability and security. 
(2)  Resilience  of  the  transmission  and  distribution  networks  will  bring  improvement 
of transmission and distribution losses (13% in 2016 to 8% in 2030), decrease the 
System  Average  Interruption  Duration  Index  and  System  Average  Interruption 
XVIII
Frequency Index to less than 620 minutes and 7.3 times, respectively, and increase 
the household electrification ratio from the current 70% to 95% in 2030 through 
connecting to the national grid. This will contribute to accessibility, security, and 
safety.
(3)  Reforms of electricity tariffs, such as time-of-use and cross-subsidy systems, have 
to contribute to the levelisation of electricity demand and elimination of the price 
gap between urban and rural areas and maintain affordability and transparency. 
Renewable energy
Renewable energy consists of hydro, biomass, and solar/PV in Cambodia. Wind is very 
hard  to  install  due  to  insufficient  wind  conditions  in  Cambodia.  Hydro  will  increase 
continuously as a major power source based on its affordability and security. Biomass and 
solar/PV are treated here. 
(1)  Traditional biomass will be phased out and replaced by LPG for its use for cooking 
in rural areas. However, highly efficient biomass cooking stoves are recommended. 
A biomass supply chain might be established to supply fabricated biomass such as 
wood chips to final users in rural areas.
 Another biomass use will be power generation to be applied in isolated areas (with 
no national grid). Its target will be 6.5% of total power generation in 2030.
(2) 
(3)  There  are  several  policies  to  promote  solar/PV  systems,  such  as  feed-in 
tariffs,  Renewable  Portfolio  Standards,  and  net  metering.  However,  the  BEPC 
recommends not to apply these policies for the penetration of solar/PV. The MME 
will  open  the  power  generation  market  to  local  and  foreign  entities  such  as  the 
Asian Development Bank and private companies to install solar/PV in Cambodia 
for supplying electricity to subscribers. Its target will be 3.5% in 2030. 
Energy efficiency
Energy efficiency is crucial for Cambodia because the TPES without biomass has increased 
much more than GDP growth, as mentioned before. On the other hand, energy prices 
in Cambodia, such as for electricity and LPG, are fully marketed (no subsidies) and this 
brings  incentives  for  energy  consumers,  such  as  saving  energy  costs  through  applying 
energy  efficiency  and  conservation  (EEC)  activities.  Thus,  the  necessary  EEC  policies, 
action plans, and targets of the industry, commercial, and residential sectors are specified 
here, especially for saving electricity consumption. The BEPC recommends the following:
XIX
(1)  Apply the same energy saving target, a 10% reduction from the BAU, across sectors 
until 2030. 
(2)  Apply  a  standards  and  labelling  system  to  appliances  used  by  households.  An 
inspection laboratory will need to be set up in Cambodia. 
(3)  The MME has to grow local energy managers and invite energy service companies, 
both  local  and  foreign  companies,  for  engaging  in  engineering  EEC  activities  in 
the  industry  (factories)  and  commercial  (buildings)  sectors.  In  this  regard,  an 
association of energy managers or energy service companies, such as the Cambodia 
Chapter  of  the  American  Society  of  Heating,  Refrigerating  and  Air-conditioning 
Engineers, will be established. 
Education  and  campaigns  on  EEC  are  important  and  will  contribute  to  making 
Cambodian people aware of EEC.
(4) 
(5)  When EEC becomes popular in Cambodia, the MME will have to set up an EEC 
regulation  under  the  electricity  law.  The  regulation  will  support  the  EEC  action 
plans mentioned above.
Energy security
There  are  many  energy  security  issues,  such  as  the  diversity  of  energy  supply  sources 
outside Cambodia, the increase of domestic energy such as hydro and biomass, emergency 
preparedness and response (EPR), stockpiling, the resilience of the energy supply chain, 
and  power  grid  interconnection  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion.  Here,  we  introduce 
only EPR and grid interconnection.
(1) 
EPR is a plan or procedure for when Cambodia faces an emergency. EPR clearly 
specifies  three  measures:  short  term,  medium  term,  and  long  term.  The  short-
term measure emphasises how to reduce energy consumption quickly, while the 
medium and long-term measures mention the diversity of energy supply sources, 
promotion of EEC, and stockpiling. The establishment of the National Emergency 
Supply  Organization  (NESO)  is  also  very  important.  NESO  consists  of  several 
ministries  (energy,  industry,  commerce,  transport)  and  large  energy  supply  and 
consumption companies, and is headed by the prime minister. NESO works on the 
coordination, harmonisation, and prioritisation of a limited energy supply to final 
users under an emergency.
(2)  Cambodia  has  imported  electricity  from  Viet  Nam  and  Thailand  historically  and 
will  import  it  from  Lao  PDR  soon.  As  such,  Cambodia  has  already  joined  a  grid 
interconnection  network  amongst  the  countries,  but  this  is  on  a  bilateral  basis. 
According  to  the  BEPC,  60%  of  power  generation  will  come  from  hydropower 
plants, and this will depend on the volume of water flow, which is usually affected 
XX
by climate conditions. In order to secure electricity supply in Cambodia, a power 
trade system on a multilateral basis is recommended.
Energy outlook
Two  energy  outlooks,  business  as  usual  and  the  alternative  policy  scenario  (applying 
targets specified by the BEPC), are projected up to 2030. Both outlooks show the trends 
of total final energy consumption (TFEC) and TPES up to 2030. Thus, the MME will surely 
monitor the actual TFEC and TPES from Cambodia’s energy balance tables to be produced 
continuously after 2017 and compare them with the projected trends in the BEPC. If the 
actual TFEC or TPES differs from the trends, the MME will make checks (regarding why 
the difference is generated) and take action (revise action plans and policies) by applying 
a  Plan-Do-Check-Action  cycle.  However,  the  TFEC  and  TPES  can  become  volatile 
depending  on  the  economic  conditions,  such  as  GDP,  so  that  the  intensity  defined  as 
TFEC/GDP and TPES/GDP is better than the TFEC and TPES themselves. The intensity 
of the TFEC is shown in Figure 3.

   Issues and required policies for petroleum products 
   on the demand side
 
 
1.1.1  The demand trend
Cambodia  has  attained  high  economic  growth  since  1999.  Although  growth  was 
temporarily stagnant due to the global financial crisis in 2009, it continued to increase 
by 7% from 2011 onwards. According to the International Monetary Fund and the Asian 
Development Bank, the Cambodian economy is expected to continue growing steadily, 
supported by strong domestic demand.

Economic growth has increased demand for petroleum products, and petroleum product 
imports  have  continued  to  increase.  From  2012  to  2016,  the  demand  for  petroleum 
products  increased  by  7.2%  per  year.  Amongst  them,  gasoline,  diesel  oil,  and  liquefied 
petroleum gas (LPG), which are the main products, showed high growth rates of 6.1%, 
8.4%, and 23.0%, respectively. 
Furthermore, according to the demand forecast by the Economic Research Institute for 
ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA), the total demand for petroleum products in the year 2040 
is expected to be 4,650 kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe) (3.8% growth per year) under 
the assumption of stable economic growth.

Because  Cambodia  is  in  the  development  stage,  it  is  expected  that  oil  demand  may 
increase  more  than  the  economic  growth  rate  at  times.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to 
consider how to respond to increasing oil demand.
With the expansion of demand, we have to consider the following issues:
•  Environmental burden
•  Accidents in each field
•  Deterioration of the trade balance
There is concern that the environmental burden, such as air pollution, will become worse, 
and the number of accidents will increase. The trade balance will also worsen due to an 
increase in imports of oil. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality of petroleum 
products to prevent air pollution and to strengthen the regulations for fire prevention in oil 
storage, transportation, and sales. In Asia, the environmental burden has increased due 
to the rapidly rising oil demand in some countries, but measures have been taken when 
the problem has become serious. It is necessary to implement countermeasures at the 
appropriate time, taking this as a lesson. It is also important to promote energy saving and 
alternative energy and take measures to prevent international oil supply disruptions and 
oil supply shortages due to natural disasters.
1.1.2   Action plans and necessary policies on the demand side
(1) 
 Energy saving in the transport sector
Energy saving not only improves the international balance of payments by reducing the 
imports of fossil fuels but also contributes to reducing the environmental burden. 
The following are effective examples of action plans in the medium-to-long term:
Import restrictions on old cars (medium or long-term policy)
• 
•  Preferred tax system for fuel-efficient cars (medium-term policy)
•  Fuel consumption regulation by type of vehicle (long-term policy)

Consultation  and  cooperation  with  the  relevant  ministries  and  agencies,  such  as  the 
Ministry  of  Transportation  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  are  necessary  to 
implement these action plans.
(2) 
State of demand for petroleum products
In order to extract the issues and formulate policies, it is important to grasp the actual 
state  of  the  consumption  of  petroleum  products  and  recognise  the  products  that  are 
being  rapidly  expanded.  It  is  necessary  to  have  a  system  for  periodically  collecting  the 
required data from oil companies and conducting market research. Also, in future, if we 
can clarify the data on petroleum consumption intensity for each sector, the targets for 
fuel efficiency and alternative energy will be clearer.
(3) 
 Promotion of alternative energy
Biogasoline, electric vehicles (EV), electric bikes (EB), and compressed natural gas (CNG) 
have the effect of decreasing oil demand. The balance between the benefits of reducing 
oil imports and the costs of introducing alternative energy should be studied, and, in order 
to assess the benefits, a pilot project should be considered. 
4
(4) 
 Establishment of the quality specifications for petroleum products
The quality of petroleum products is also an issue on the supply side, but quality assurance is 
an effective policy for reducing the environmental burden, such as air pollution associated 
with the expansion of demand. Quality should be gradually improved while looking at the 
circumstances of neighbouring countries.
(5) 
 Strengthening of regulations aimed at preventing accidents 
There is a risk that accidents will increase due to the expansion of oil demand. Regulations 
are  required  to  prevent  accidents  in  the  fields  of  oil  storage,  transportation,  sales,  and 
consumption. Especially for LPG, since accidents at the consumption stage have been 
increasing, consumer awareness is important.
1.2     Issues and required policies for petroleum products 
  on the supply side
 
 
1.2.1   The supply situation
Cambodia currently imports 100% of its petroleum products. The import sources are
mainly Thailand, Viet Nam, and Singapore. Quality specifications of petroleum products 
have not been established, so there are variations in the quality of imported goods. 
Meanwhile,  the  construction  of  a  domestic  refinery  is  planned  by  a  private  enterprise. 
Because this refinery is small in size, there is a possibility that it will be subject to severe 
competition  from  imported  goods.  Having  refineries  in  the  country  is  important  for 
energy security, but it is necessary for the refineries to be competitive with refineries in 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. There are large refineries in 
Asia, as shown in Table 1.2.

1.2.2   Action plans and necessary policies on the supply side
The most important objectives are affordable prices and an accessible and safe supply 
of oil. This will contribute to national security and economic growth and will be achieved 
through a transparent market. The relevant agencies and companies can contribute to the 
petroleum market data on supply and demand and prices.
A transparent market will promote the following:
•  The diversification of supply sources
•  Resilience in the supply chain of petroleum products
Laws and regulations and a preferential tax system are the platform of a transparent market 
and also contribute to ensuring safety and the promotion of fuel efficiency and alternative 
energy.  In  order  to  advance  these  policies,  cooperation  with  the  related  ministries  and 
agencies is necessary.

Early promulgation and the implementation of laws and regulations
Laws and regulations are the platform of a transparent market and contribute to ensuring 
safety.  The  following  laws  and  regulations  are  ready,  and  early  promulgation  and 
implementation are expected:
•  Petroleum Law 
•  Sub-decree on Licenses and Permit Letters
•  Specifications of petroleum products
•  Assurance of quality of petroleum products 
•  Technical Regulation on Storage Tanks
•  Technical Regulation on Petroleum Service Stations
•  Technical Regulation on Bottling Stations of LPG
•  Technical Regulation on Storage of LPG

CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
(2)  
Diversification of supply sources 
The oversupply of petroleum products in China, the Republic of Korea (hereafter, Korea), 
Taiwan,  India,  and  the  Middle  East  is  expected  to  continue  in  the  medium  term,  and 
Cambodia should seek cheap procurement sources. The diversification of supply sources 
also  contributes  to  energy  security.  Understanding  the  price  formulas  of  importing 
petroleum  products  is  important.  In  an  oversupply  environment,  it  is  encouraged  that 
importing companies look for the appropriate procurement sources. 
:  China’s export volume of petroleum products is over 15 million kilolitres (kl) per 
year.

Promotion of a transparent market
Currently,  Cambodia  lacks  statistical  data  on  the  oil  market.  For  statistical  data  on 
supply and demand, although the energy balance table has been developed, it must be 
continuously updated and further improved in its level of detail, such as for petroleum 
demand and supply data on both a yearly and monthly basis. It is also necessary to further 
improve the data, such as on the number, size, and location of oil terminals, LPG bottling 
stations, gas stations, and petroleum service stations, etc. Increasing market transparency 
will lead to the following:
•  Resilience of the supply chain of petroleum products
• 
Investment opportunities for market participants
•  The fostering of a strong and active oil industry
9
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
Such a market environment will contribute to affordable prices and an accessible and safe 
supply.
(4)  
Quality assurance of petroleum products 
.  Establishment of quality specifications
   Currently,  since  Cambodia  imports  all  its  petroleum  products,  it  is  necessary  to 
check the specifications of the exporting countries and determine the specifications 
for Cambodia, taking into consideration the balance between the purchase price 
and the environmental burden, as high-quality products have high prices.
.  Promulgation of the prakas (regulations)
  Based  on  the  Petroleum  Law,  restrictions  on  quality  assurance  at  the  time  of 
storage, transfer, and sale of petroleum products should be conducted.
In the prakas, the following shall be stipulated.
Clarification of who is obligated
The refinery (petroleum products producer), oil terminal, petroleum service station, gas 
station, or LPG bottling station should be obligated to ensure quality. 
Designation of inspection centres
The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) should designate inspection centres with capacity 
and experience. Those obligated to ensure quality must periodically undergo inspection 
by  the  MME.  The  inspection  centre  performs  quality  inspection  practices  by  receiving 
consignments  from  the  MME.  Refineries,  oil  terminals,  petroleum  service  stations,  gas 
stations, and LPG bottling stations can also ask for inspections from inspection centres.
Inspection items
In order to shorten the time required for inspection and to reduce the inspection costs, 
inspection items should be set and be subject to inspection.
(5)  
Stockpiling of petroleum products (including crude oil) 
Currently,  importing  companies  are  carrying  out  commercial  stockpiling  for  30  days 
according to the prakas by the Ministry of Commerce. This should be executed reliably 
by the Petroleum Law to ensure industry stock (strategic petroleum reserves by private 
companies).  Oil  stockpiles  are  an  effective  means  of  countering  the  risk  of  disruptions 
in  international  markets,  such  as  sudden  crude  oil  supply  shortages  due  to  accidents 
and natural disasters, and it is necessary to gradually strengthen oil stockpiles. Also, the 
10
national stock (strategic petroleum reserves by the government) should be considered in 
the medium or long term. There are also low-cost methods, such as ticket stockpiling in 
foreign countries, and various options that should be considered.
(6) 
 Introduction of biogasoline (E3) 
Cambodia has crude oil resources, but their development will take time. There are no oil-
refining facilities in the country at the present time, and all petroleum products depend on 
imports, which is a critical issue for the national trade balance.
Because of this situation, biogasoline, as a domestically produced liquid fuel, is important 
for  the  improvement  of  the  national  trade  balance  and  energy  supply  security.  The 
development of biogasoline can form an industry chain of cassava cultivation, bioethanol 
manufacturing, and biogasoline production. The promotion of biogasoline contributes to 
improving farmers’ incomes, reducing gasoline imports, and reducing greenhouse gases.
The key to successfully introducing biogasoline into Cambodia is to reduce the production 
cost of cassava as a raw material, reduce bioethanol production costs, and promote the 
consumption  of  biogasoline.  Establishing  bioethanol  policies  and  related  regulations, 
such as biogasoline specifications, safety regulations, and roadmaps, is also required. To 
achieve these policy objectives, cooperation between the related ministries and agencies 
is indispensable.
Regarding the quality specification of biogasoline, it is preferable to upgrade step by step 
to ethanol protection engines, such as from E3 to E5 and E10, according to vehicle speed. 
E3, which is blended ethanol 3%, should be the first step because E3 has no effect on old 
cars. In order to introduce biogasoline into Cambodia, it is necessary for the government 
to encourage it by providing some incentives, and the promotion of a pilot project would 
also be effective. The primary goal of the pilot project would be to catch the issues that 
may occur during the initial deployment and promptly take effective countermeasures.
11
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
:  Targets of the pilot project:
•  Catch issues and consider countermeasures 
•  Secure the ethanol supply chain
Improve public consciousness
• 
:  Benefits of the introduction of biogasoline:
•  Agricultural industry development
-   Increase in cassava demand : increase in farmer income
Improvement of the trade balance
-   Reduction in the outflow of Cambodian monetary assets
Improvement of energy security
-   Reduction in reliance on imported fossil fuels
• 
• 
•  Greenhouse gas reduction
-   Bioethanol can replace gasoline consumption and reduce CO2
(7) 
Resilience of the supply chain of petroleum products
Based on the medium-to-long–term forecast for the demand for petroleum products, the 
government needs to prepare a petroleum supply plan. 
The objective of the petroleum supply plan is to consider optimal logistics measures,
assuming the scale, location, and timing of the new expansion of the oil supply base. This 
will lead to resilience of the supply chain of petroleum products.
•  A reasonable supply plan should be considered based on the demand assumptions 
by province.
•  The  supply  plan  should  include  new  or  expansion  plans  for  refineries,  import 
terminals, and secondary terminals and their locations, sizes, and timing.
•  The optimal means of transportation should be studied, such as tank trucks, ships, 
railroad, and pipelines.
The above are the optimal logistics based on the supply plan.

1.3     Conclusion
Oil  demand  in  Cambodia  has  increased  rapidly  in  recent  years,  and  it  is  expected  that 
it will continue to increase with economic growth in the future. With the expansion of 
demand,  we  have  to  consider  the  environmental  burden,  the  accidents  in  each  field, 
and the deterioration of the trade balance. It is necessary to take countermeasures at an 
appropriate time before problems become serious. It is also important to promote energy 
saving and alternative energy sources and take measures against international oil supply 
disruptions and shortages due to natural disasters. 
The action plans and necessary policies on the demand side are as follows:
(1)  Energy savings in the transport sector through the promotion of eco cars 
(2)  Grasping of the actual state of demand for petroleum products
(3)  Promotion of alternative energy
(4)  Establishment of quality specifications to prevent air pollution
(5)  Strengthening regulations aimed at preventing accidents, including on the supply side
13
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
On the other hand, the most important objectives of the supply side are affordable prices 
and an accessible and safe supply. This will be achieved through a transparent market. This 
means that the data on supply and demand and prices should be maintained so anyone 
can  access  the  data  on  the  petroleum  market.  In  addition,  laws  and  regulations  and  a 
preferential tax system are the platforms for a transparent market and also contribute to 
ensuring safety and the promotion of fuel efficiency and alternative energy. Collaboration 
with the related ministries and agencies is necessary to advance them.
The action plans and necessary policies on the supply side are as follows:
(1)  Early promulgation and implementation of laws and regulations
(2)  Diversification of supply sources
(3)  Promotion of a transparent market
(4)  Quality assurance of petroleum products
(5)  Stockpiling of petroleum products (including crude oil)
(6)  Introduction of biogasoline (E3)
(7)  Resilience of the supply chain for petroleum products

CHAPTER 2
ELECTRICITY
2.1     Review of the current situation and selected major 
   issues
 
 
This chapter focuses on Cambodia’s basic electricity plan. The electricity plan of Cambodia 
has  been  conducted  based  on  the  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  (NSDP) 
2014–2018.1  The  government  focuses  on  (i)  ensuring  supply  capacity,  (ii)  improving 
electrification, and (iii) reducing tariffs. The content has been concluded as follows.
2.1.1   Ensuring supply for the best energy mix
•  Reduce reliance on petroleum fuels for electricity generation so supply capacity and 
diversified energy sources such as hydropower, natural gas, and coal are expanded.
•  Hydropower and coal-fired power plants are broadly preferred along with the import of 
electricity from neighbouring countries.
Invest  in  electricity  generation  infrastructure  focusing  on  technical  and  economic 
efficiency and minimising the environmental and social impacts by the private sector, 
such as independent power producers (IPPs).
• 
•  Encourage  the  efficient  use  of  energy  and  mitigate  the  adverse  effects  on  the 
environment resulting from energy supply and use.
Outstanding issues
•  The  maximum  electricity  production  from  hydropower  plants  occurred  only  in  the 
rainy season. In the dry season, the power production generated was only 25%.

CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
2.1.2   Improving electrification by expanding transmission and 
  distribution networks
 
 
•  To reduce electricity losses, transmission and distribution networks are expanded.
•  To  regionally  expand  economic  cooperation,  which  maximises  the  use  of  resources 
in  the  region  to  achieve  the  most  benefit,  Cambodia  has  been  participating  in  the 
implementation  of  a  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  power  trade  plan  and  the 
ASEAN Power Grid plan.
•  To strengthen energy security and ensure an efficient, safe, high-quality, reliable, and 
affordable electricity supply, all levels of the transmission and distribution networks 
are developed.
Invest  in  transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  focusing  on  technical  and 
economic  efficiency  and  minimising  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  by  the 
private sector.
• 
To realise the goal that ‘by 2020, all villages in the Kingdom of Cambodia will have access 
to  electricity  supplied  by  the  national  grid  and  other  sources’,  implementation  of  the 
electrification strategy is accelerated.   
•  Promote regional electricity trade through bilateral and multilateral cooperation.
Outstanding issues
•  Due  to  the  high  costs  required  to  build  electricity  infrastructure  in  numerous  rural 
areas in Cambodia, the electricity supply in rural areas is limited as most areas are not 
yet connected to the grid.  
•  The expansion of distribution lines to rural areas is limited, and the unit cost remains 
relatively high compared to the unit cost in neighbouring countries.
2.1.3   Reducing tariffs to make them more affordable
•  Further support the rural electrification fund aimed at acquiring equitable electricity 
access for all citizens through government funding and social funding by Electricite Du 
Cambodge (EDC), and seek funding support from other development partners. 
•  Pursue  rational  measures  for  electricity  consumption  by  reducing  power  tariffs 
during off-peak hours to serve production and irrigation systems aimed at improving 
agricultural productivity and accelerating the development of industry and handicraft 
sectors.
16
•  Maximise revenue inflows through multi-layered revenues such as royalties, production 
sharing, and income tax to increase the government’s financial capacity.
•  Reduce tariffs to an appropriate level in the whole country.
Outstanding issues
•  Electricity tariffs in rural areas are higher than in urban areas.
•  The tariff cost is relatively high compared to the tariff cost in neighbouring countries.
To solve the above outstanding issues, this chapter reviews the current situation, describes 
the targets for 2030, and considers the necessary policies with a roadmap. 
 
2.2     Generation
2.2.1   Targets by 2030
According to the Ministry of Mines and Energy’s (MME) generation development plan for 
2017–2030 (Table 2.1) and the forecasted demand by the Economic Research Institute 
for  ASEAN  and  East  Asia’s  (ERIA)  outlook  in  Chapters  1  and  6,  this  section  describes 
two cases, Case 1 (Power Development Plan [PDP]) and Case 2 (ERIA_BAU), for the 
targets  by  2030  in  regard  to  power  generation  calculated  using  the  power  generation 
capacity and several conditions, such as the capacity factor and the loss of transmission 
and distribution lines. 
Case 1 focuses on the relationship between the existing PDP of the MME and forecasted 
demand (outlook by ERIA). Case 2 is an aggressive pattern that includes the maximal use 
of solar/wind and biomass power and mainly hydro potential, which is estimated at about 
10,000 megawatts (MW) by the hydroelectricity department of the MME.
Table 2.2 presents the revised capacity in the aggressive case (Case 2). In this case, hydro, 
biomass, and solar/wind capacity will increase by approximately 350 MW/year (3,526 
MW/10  years),  30  MW/year  (301  MW/10  years),  and  36  MW/year  (368  MW/10 
years), respectively, compared with Case 1 from 2021 to 2030. In order to achieve the 
best  mix  in  2030,  the  coal/gas  capacity  will  decrease  by  approximately  130  MW/year 
(–1,317 MW) compared to Case 1 from 2021 to 2030.

Case descriptions
Common condition: Case 1 and Case 2 
•  Demand is the same as in the outlook by ERIA (Table 2.5)
•  Supply (including loss) + import = demand (outlook by ERIA)
• 
Import: The constant amount of electricity imported from 2020 to 2030 (Table 2.5) 
Demand = national capacity + electricity imported
•  Oil: Gradually reduced high cost as an impact of no oil use from 2020
Case 1:  Existing PDP (2017–2030)
•  Capacity:  Planned  capacity  mentioned  in  the  power  generation  development  plan, 
covering the years from 2017 to 2030 (Table 2.1)  
•  Loss: 10% of the total national power supply is transmission and distribution losses.
•  Capacity factor: Coal/gas (85%), oil (85%), hydro (35%), biomass (40%), solar (15%), 
wind (20%). The capacity factor of hydro plants in the dry season is 35%. In order to 
ensure  essential  power  generation,  the  percentage  is  completely  used  in  the  whole 
year. 
•  Required import supply: Calculated according to demand – supply. A negative value 
for  imports  reflects  an  excess  of  electricity  power  supply  in  a  year  and  encourages 
electricity  exports  or  a  reduction  of  electricity  generation,  while  a  positive  value  of 
imports reflects the need for imported electricity.
Table 2.3 and Figure 2.1 show the power generation capacity in Case 1. Referring to the 
existing plan by 2030, a lack of peak capacity will occur in 2030 and peak with a +20% 
margin  in  2030  using  estimated  data  on  2020  and  2025  using  the  linear  extrapolation 
method. Therefore, this case roughly indicates the capacity needed by 2030 if the current 
plan is implemented by 2030. Imported electricity is not included in this data, but it is 
surely an aspect to be considered in the power supply calculation.

Case 2: Recommended pattern
•  Power  supply:  The  total  amount  of  the  power  supply  is  the  same  as  in  the  current 
generation development plan from 2017 to 2030. 
•  Additional capacity (2021 to 2030): Consider only hydro and renewable energy (RE) 
(biomass, solar/wind) in terms of reducing the use of fossil fuels.
•  Loss: 10% of the total national power supply is transmission and distribution losses.
•  Capacity factor: Coal/gas (85%), oil (85%), hydro (35%), biomass (40%), solar (15%), 
wind (20%). The capacity factor of hydro plants in the dry season is 35%. In order to 
ensure essential power generation, the percentage is completely used in a whole year. 
•  Required import supply: Calculated according to demand – supply. A negative value 
for  imports  reflects  an  excess  of  electricity  power  supply  in  a  year  and  encourages 
electricity  exports  or  a  reduction  of  electricity  generation,  while  a  positive  value  of 
imports reflects the need for imported electricity.
•  Oil: Gradually reduced as an impact of no oil use from 2020.
• 
Import: Gradually reduced as an impact of no imports from 2022.
20
Table 2.4 and Figure 2.2 show the power generation capacity in Case 2. Since constructing 
new generation capacity requires time, this case only considers additional hydro and RE 
capacity from 2021 and 2030, respectively. These capacities are also presented in Table 
2.2. The total capacity of the current PDP is 4,716 MW in 2030, but the total capacity of 
the revised plan is 7,081 MW due to a difference in the capacity factor between coal/gas 
(85%) and hydro (35%). Therefore, if the energy mix is prioritised towards hydro and RE, 
increased total capacity will be required. In this case, the total capacity is over the peak 
demand with a +20% margin each year without electricity imports. The figure shows there 
will be capacity access shown above the dotted line for peak demand with a +20% margin, 
which benefits operators by having the best-chosen electricity resource, resulting in some 
long-term economic advantages such as affordable electricity prices, sustainable supply, 
and high security. To attain these advantages, Cambodia must consider not only power 
capacity planning but also transmission and distribution planning throughout the country. 
In the case of electricity exports, enhancement of the interconnection plan is needed.

We  consider  the  energy  mix  based  on  the  above  conditions.  Table  2.5  shows  the 
summarised pattern of the power generation plan by 2030. Demand uses the basic plan 
from the outlook by ERIA as a reference.
Figure  2.3(a)  shows  the  power  supply  mix  and  electricity  demand  in  Case  1  for  the 
current existing plan. The dependency on fossil fuels will increase towards 2030 due to 
the massive use of coal/gas power plants. The percentage in the energy mix will be 68% 
in 2030. To reach the power demand of 19.7 terawatt hours (TWh) using a controllable 
supply consisting of coal/gas, hydro, and RE, this percentage will increase to a minimum 
of 70%, which is also a high percentage for fossil fuel dependency. Therefore, the current 
plan by 2030 has high potential fossil fuel dependency as fossil fuels are a major energy 
source in the world today. On the other hand, the overconsumption of fossil fuels can 
lead  to  serious  environmental  issues  such  as  air  pollution  and  global  warming.  What  is 
more, as this resource is limited, prices will possibly change drastically. Hence, the higher 
dependency on fossil fuels will result in higher potential risk.
22
Based on Case 1, we consider a recommended Basic Energy Plan for Cambodia (BEPC) 
pattern for Case 2. Figure 2.3(b) shows the power supply mix in Case 2. The total supply 
is the same as in Case 1 (26.2 TWh). In order to reduce fossil fuel dependency, hydro and 
RE capacity are increased. In 2030, the energy mix of fossil fuels will be 35%.

The reasons for the additional hydropower plant capacity are the following:
•  To minimise the potential risk from the coal price
•  To improve energy security
•  To reduce the environmental impacts (air pollution, global warming) 
Figure  2.4  shows  the  levelised  cost  of  electricity  (LCOE)  for  generating  plants  in  14 
Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  countries  plus 
Brazil, China, and South Africa. The LCOE of coal is relatively lower than for hydropower 
plants. However, the LCOE of hydro varies widely between US$15/MWh and US$388/
MWh as the LCOE of hydropower is strongly correlated with the investment cost (Figure 
2.5). Figure 2.6 shows the LCOE component ratios of coal and hydro. The LCOE for hydro 
contains  an  85%  investment  cost.  On  the  other  hand,  the  LCOE  component  ratios  for 
coal are 28% investment costs, 35% fuel costs, 27% carbon costs, and 10% operation and 
maintenance costs. Therefore, there is a possibility that the LCOE costs will be higher than 
for hydro due to an increase in the imported coal price in the future. Figure 2.7 shows the 
historical coal price change from 1998 to 2008 in the US, Japan, and northwest Europe. 
The annual coal prices in 2008 increased drastically by about 3.6–5.2 times from 1998. 
Where  profitability  is  defined  as  revenues  minus  long-run  operating  costs,  the  Carbon 
Tracker Initiative’s analysis finds that due to high fuel costs, 42% of coal capacity operating 
today could be losing money in the world.2 Therefore, the higher dependency on fossil 
fuels, in this case coal, resulted in a higher risk potential, including the electricity price.

Cambodia  relies  on  imported  fossil  fuels,  including  coal.  The  lack  of  energy  security  is 
linked to the negative economic and social impacts of either the physical unavailability of 
energy or prices that are not competitive or are overly volatile. Details on energy security 
are described in Chapter 5. 
The conventional coal-fired plants generally used in Cambodia generate some significant 
disadvantages,  including  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  mining  destruction,  the 
generation  of  millions  of  tonnes  of  waste,  and  the  emission  of  harmful  substances. 
The  greater  the  number  of  constructed  conventional  coal-fired  plants,  the  greater  the 
negative  impact  on  the  environment.  GHG  emissions  are  the  result  of  harmful  waste 
from the combustion of coal, which causes pollution and contributes to global warming. 
The increase in carbon emissions by coal-fired plants has led to further global warming, 
which has an impact on climate change. Thermal plants like coal-fired plants emit harmful 
substances  into  the  environment.  These  include  mercury,  sulphur  dioxide,  carbon 
monoxide, mercury, selenium, and arsenic. These harmful substances not only cause acid 
rain but are also very harmful to humans. To mitigate the situation, clean coal technology, 
such  as  ultra-supercritical  (USC),  integrated  gasification  combined  cycle  (IGCC),  and 
carbon capture and storage (CCS), will be needed when Cambodia plans new coal power 
plants. 
27
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
The targets by 2030 are summarised as follows. 
Targets by 2030
•  Basic energy mix: Coal/gas (35%), hydro (55%), RE (biomass, solar, and wind) (10%)
•  Export electricity to neighbouring country.
• 
Improve the utilisation of diverse energy sources.
2.2.2   Necessary action plans and policies
The necessary action plans and policies to reach the targets by 2030 are described here.
To achieve the targets by 2030, additional capacity is required of approximately 3,000 
MW by hydro plants, 300 MW by biomass plants, and 400 MW by solar/wind plants by 
2030. However, there will be several challenges in implementation due to the high initial 
costs, the balance of the environment, and the significant impact of the dry season. In 
consideration of these challenges, the ‘best energy mix’ is an alternative solution. 
To achieve the target of the best energy mix, the following are necessary:
•  Massive utilisation of hydro and RE potential 
•  Application of clean coal technology (USC, IGCC, CCS)
•  Conducting power trading (exports and imports) through the GMS and the ASEAN 
Power Grid (APG)
•  Utilisation of domestic gas potential
According to the necessary action plans and policies, it is recommended that the electricity 
of the BEPC be reviewed on a routine basis (every 2–5 years).  The electricity of the BEPC 
with the best energy mix should be modified as needed.   
 
2.3     Transmission
The  national  grid  consists  of  three  main  components:  high  voltage  (HV)  substations, 
HV transmission lines, and the dispatching centre. The development of the national grid 
has three main objectives: (i) provide the opportunity to develop and integrate all power 
sources in the country into one grid system, (ii) expand the substations and transmission 
lines to provide electricity to cities and provinces throughout the country, and (iii) manage 
and control the operation of power sources to provide electricity to all areas efficiently, 
sustainably, and safely. The goal of national grid development by 2020 is shown in Figure 
2.8. The national transmission master plan of 2016 is presented in Tables 2.6 to 2.8.

2.3.1  Targets by 2030
2.3.1.1  National grid expansion
The HV transmission system, i.e., the ‘national grid’, will gradually establish grid substations 
in  each  district  to  provide  outlets  for  supplying  electricity  from  the  national  grid.  The 
grid  substations  are  to  be  located  in  the  central  area  of  each  province  to  facilitate  the 
development of a sub-transmission system to transmit electricity from the national grid to 
rural areas. The projects for the expansion of the electricity supply from the national grid 
and  from  networks  importing  electricity  from  neighbouring  countries  to  the  rural  areas 
are to be implemented as the first priority, as they will provide a higher quality and less 
expensive electricity supply compared to the supply from the existing diesel generators. 
On the other hand, sudden expansion of the power transmission and distribution network 
may  easily  cause  electricity  shortages  for  the  entire  national  grid,  especially  in  the  dry 
season. This naturally requires a secure, continuous supply. The current choice in which 
the power source completely depends on IPP and imports is not necessarily the only way 
to avoid an intermittent electricity supply from the energy security point of view, yet it 
should be one of the effective options in the process of promoting electrification. From 
the  above,  the  direction  to  preferentially  consolidate  the  transmission  and  distribution 
network can be regarded as reasonable.
2.3.1.2  Interconnection line with neighbouring countries
In  2016,  Cambodia  connected  regional  countries  via  several  transmission  lines.3  The 
importing of electricity from Thailand, Viet Nam, and the Lao PDR started at the end of 
2007, in 2009, and 2010, respectively. Electric power between Cambodia and Thailand 
is transmitted at the 115 kV and 22 kV levels. The 115 kV transmission line from Aranya 
Prathet substation, connecting Thailand to Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, and Siem 
Reap, was commissioned in 2007. An agreement was signed with Trat Province (Thailand) 
to supply power to Koh Kong Province and Poi Pet via the 22 kV line.  EDC imported power 
from Viet Nam via a 230 kV transmission line to supply Phnom Den, Takeo Province, and 
Phnom Penh in March 2009. Since 2002, EDC has imported power from PC2 (Viet Nam) 
to supply power to Memut and Pnhea Krek Districts of Kampong Cham Province, Bavet 
in Svay Rieng Province, Kampong Trach in Kampot Province, Koh Thom and Chrey Thom 
in  Kandal  Province,  Snuol  District  in  Kratie  Province,  Keo  Seima  District  in  Mondulkiri

Province, and Kompong Ro in Svay Rieng Province. The 22 kV interconnection line from 
the Lao PDR to Stung Treng was charged in 2010. In 2015, a new interconnection point 
from  Champasak  Province,  Ban  Hat  Substation,  Lao  PDR,  to  Kampong  Sralu,  Preah 
Vihear Province, Cambodia, was created and the initial design and construction for the 
115 kV transmission line was energised at the 22 kV voltage level for the first stage until 
the transmission line from the Lao PDR border to Chey Sen Substation was completed. 
Figure  2.9  shows  the  areas  of  electricity  imports  from  neighbouring  countries.  Each 
connection between countries has a different grid standard (voltage control or frequency 
control,  etc.)  due  to  the  different  demand  in  each  area.  Therefore,  to  connect  to  the 
national grid and start multilateral trading, harmonisation of the grid standard is needed.

In  order  to  achieve  affordable  electricity  and  to  ensure  regional  energy  security  by 
promoting  the  efficient  utilisation  of  resources  in  the  future,  it  is  recommended  to 
conduct not only bilateral trading but also multilateral trading amongst GMS and ASEAN 
countries.  In  the  case  of  Cambodia,  although  improving  the  national  grid  connection, 
transmission  capacity,  and  interconnection  capacity  are  prioritised  projects,  Cambodia 
should conduct a study and trading trial for exporting electricity to neighbouring countries 
in a parallel way. This would improve connections to the national grid and improve access 
to energy services in the region.

2.3.1.3  Transmission and distribution loss
Figure 2.10 shows the transmission and distribution loss from 2013 to 2016 for Viet Nam 
as a reference. The whole country received electricity not only from EDC but also another 
rural electricity enterprise (REE) distributor. Based on this figure, the transmission loss 
of the whole country was higher than for EDC. If the whole country can connect to the 
EDC grid in the future, the difference in the loss between the two lines in the graph will be 
reduced to the loss by EDC.

Figure 2.11 shows the distribution losses from 2014 to 2016.4 A higher bar represents 
purchased energy, while a lower one represents sold energy. The decreasing line is the 
distribution losses in total by year. At the end of 2016, the Cambodia system distribution 
loss was 8.7%, which was higher than the distribution loss for Viet Nam (6.1% in 2014, 
falling  in  2016  as  an  assumption).  Therefore,  improvement  in  the  quality  of  electricity 
(stable voltage level and frequency) through distribution network development is needed 
for the distribution loss to decrease to be the same as the percentages in neighbouring 
countries. The distribution loss percentage decreased by 1.4%–1.6% per year from 2014 
to  2016.  Reducing  the  loss  requires  more  efforts.  Hence,  we  assume  the  decreasing 
percentage is 0.2% per year until 2030 towards 6.0% distribution losses in 2030.

To improve the distribution losses, the development of distribution lines, maintenance of 
infrastructure, and standards for distribution equipment are necessary. Table 2.9 shows 
the distribution network support projects until 2020. In 2012, the Asian Development 
Bank  (ADB)  supported  the  improvement  of  the  electrification  rate  in  some  provinces, 
and  today,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  currently  supports  the 
Phnom Penh distribution system until 2020. It is recommended to continue long-term 
relationships  with  external  support  and  the  development  of  guidelines  for  maintaining 
distribution quality.

2.3.1.4  System Average Interruption Duration Index and Frequency Index
The  System  Average  Interruption  Duration  Index  (SAIDI)  and  the  System  Average 
Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) are commonly used indicators for monitoring the 
reliability  of  distribution  systems  and  the  actual  situation  of  the  stable  power  supply 
at affordable prices. It is recommended to improve the reliability of power statistics by 
decreasing the number of minutes and times by years represented in the SAIDI and SAIFI. 
Figure 2.12 and Figure 2.13 show the progress of the SAIDI and SAIFI from 2012 to 2016, 
with Viet Nam in 2017 as a reference.5 The SAIDI and SAIFI decreased from 2012 through 
increasing electricity capacity. The SAIDI decreased by 5.5% and the SAIFI decreased by 
6.5% from 2015 to 2016. If the SAIDI and SAIFI are planned to decrease by the same 
percentages, 5.5% per year and 6.5% per year from 2016 to 2030, there would be a high 
possibility of achieving less than 620 minutes for the SAIDI and less than 7.3 times for the 
SAIFI in 2030. As a further improvement, it is suggested to ameliorate the reliability of the 
transmission system, such as by improving the relay system, expanding transmission lines, 
and establishing new grid substations.

2.3.1.5  Household electrification rate and national grid quality
On 30 November 2011, the Government of Cambodia issued the Strategy and Plan for 
Development  of  Rural  Electrification  in  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  (SPDR),  a  specific 
strategy and plan to achieve essential targets for rural electrification as prakas (ministry 
ordinance). This plan was discussed by the Ministry of Mine and Energy (MME), Electricity 
Authority  of  Cambodia  (EAC),  Rural  Electrification  Fund  (REF),  and  Electricite  du 
Cambodge (EDC) based on the results obtained through cooperation with international 
organisations and set up as the national goal according to the SPDRE. Under the plan, 
each organisation is supposed to take action for the targets below:
•   Village areas: Achieve an electrification rate of 100%, including battery illumination, by 
2020.
 Household electrification: Achieve an electrification rate of at least 70% connection to 
the national grid by 2030.
• 
Regarding the grid extension, which is the best method for electrification, 80% and 95% 
of  all  villages  will  receive  electricity  supply  from  the  national  grid  or  from  neighbouring 
countries  by  2020  and  2030,  respectively,  if  the  government  receives  funding  support 
to extend the grid. The target is for 70% of households to connect to the national grid by 
2030.
36
Figure 2.14 shows the progress of household electrification until 2018.6,7 Compared with 
the target for 2030, which is 70% electrified households, household electrification in 2018 
is 81%. In other words, the percentage for 2018 is beyond the target of 70% in 2030. The 
national  grid  connection  is  associated  with  affordable  prices,  sustainable  supply,  and 
high security. Thus, the target by 2030 should be re-planned to reach over 70%. The new 
target was set in our meeting with the MME, which is 95% in 2030.

CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
2.1.1   Necessary action plans and policies
In order to reach the targets by 2030, the following action plans and policies are necessary.
Achieve less than 8% transmission and distribution losses
To  reduce  transmission  and  distribution  losses,  establishing  equipment  standards, 
changing to higher voltage transmission lines, and utilising materials that cut heat loss are 
recommended. A 500 kV transmission line will be constructed from 2019 to 2025, which 
will contribute to reducing transmission losses.
•  Action 1: Establish equipment standards.
•  Action 2: Change to a higher voltage transmission line.
•  Action 3: Utilise materials for cutting heat loss.
Achieve less than 620 minutes for the SAIDI and 7.3 times for the SAIFI 
To  improve  the  SAIDI  and  SAIFI,  we  recommend  ameliorating  the  reliability  of  the 
transmission system, such as improving the relay system, expanding transmission lines, 
and establishing new grid substations.
•  Action 1: Build-up the transmission and substation systems (e.g., indoor transmission, 
two lines/loop connection).
•  Action 2: Adopt supervisory control and data acquisition and distribution management 
systems.
•  Action 3: Use underground electric cables.
Achieve 95% of households connected to the national grid
To  achieve  the  recent  target  for  household  electrification  of  95%  of  households  being 
connected  to  the  national  grid  by  2030,  continuing  national  grid  expansion  and 
conducting a national grid expansion study, including on grid reliability and multilateral 
trading amongst neighbouring countries, are needed. The current national transmission 
master plan will be finalised by 2021 or 2025. 
•  Action 1: Continue the national grid expansion.
•  Action  2:  Update  the  current  national  transmission  master  plan,  considering  grid 
reliability and multilateral trading amongst neighbouring countries.
38
2.1.2   Roadmap
For the necessary action plans and policies, the recommended roadmap is as follows.
Short term, 2019–2022:
•  Establish  equipment  standards  for  the  transmission  and  distribution  networks  with 
implementation of the national transmission master plan.
•  Study improvements in transmission and distribution losses, SAIDI, and SAIFI.
•  Set a new target of national grid electrified households.
Medium term, 2023–2026:
•  Continue implementation of the national transmission master plan.
•  Consider implementation of a study (transmission and distribution losses, SAIDI, and 
SAIFI).
•  Develop and maintain standardised substations and distribution lines in each province.
Long term, 2027–2030:
•  Grid guidelines by the MME for maintaining the quality of electricity.
•  Set the next goals for achieving further benefits from electricity.
2.4     Distribution and tariffs
The Cambodian government’s plan will ensure all villagers will have access to electricity 
by 2020.8 The growth in distribution network development and village electrification is 
shown in Figure 2.15, which presents the shares of grid connections and dispersed power 
sources. The vertical lines show the share of licenced zones as a bar graph and the share 
of  electrified  villages  as  a  line  graph.  In  the  last  10  years,  electrified  zones  increased 
significantly. In 2017, the percentage of achieved electrification licenced zones was 97.6% 
and the electrified villages rate was 81.6%. According to government plans, the target for 
the electrified villages rate is 100% in 2020. 
The distribution of licenced zones granted and the megavolt (MV) backbone of electrical 
energy  supply  system  constructed  by  the  end  of  2016  are  shown  in  Figure  2.16.9  In 
2016, Cambodia reported that 81.58% (11,558) of villages in the country had access to 
electricity via the distribution network in operation, and 15.85% (2,245) of villages were 
related to the distribution network. Looking at the remaining electrification area, 2.37% 
(336) of villages live without the benefit of electricity.

2.4.1  Targets by 2030
To  achieve  the  targets  of  the  basic  energy  plan  by  2030  of  affordability,  sustainability, 
and  security,  the  content  should  consider  not  only  expanding  electrification  but  also 
electricity tariffs, especially in rural areas. Cambodia’s electricity tariffs are higher than in 
neighbouring countries, and electricity tariffs in rural areas are higher than in urban areas 
due to the dependency on high-cost generation, such as small generation systems running 
on imported diesel fuel, high distribution network power losses, and the lack of subsidies. 
2.4.1.1  Tariff differences between urban and rural areas
Figure  2.17  shows  all  administration,  commercial,  and  industrial  consumer  tariff 
differences for villages covered by electricity licenced areas.10 These tariffs decrease when 
the covered villages are over 50%. The cost of electricity from own generation, purchases 
from IPP, and purchases from neighbouring countries or other licensees are the largest 
components  of  the  cost  of  electric  supply  by  licensees  to  the  consumers.  Hence,  the 
tariffs for electricity depend on the cost of the electricity generated or purchased. With 
the  development  of  a  grid  system,  the  tariffs  of  licensees  purchasing  electricity  from 
the grid have become stable. Therefore, the higher percentage of villages covered, the 
lower the applied tariffs. The tariff differences are 1.03 times for the yellow line and 1.22 
times for the remaining lines. In association with the graph, the tariffs also depend on the 
electricity sources purchased or utilised by licensees. For instance, if diesel/heavy fuel oil 
(HFO) is utilised, the tariff will be calculated based on it. Generally, diesel costs are higher 
than other sources and, eventually, the grid connection must be considered from the cost 
perspective.

2.4.1.2  Times of use for tariffs
From  the  above  reasonable  facts,  Cambodia  is  trying  to  reduce  electricity  tariffs.  In 
accordance with the Ministry of Mine and Energy’s Prakas (regulation) No. 0094 dated 
24  February  2015,  the  government  set  out  a  tariff  reduction  plan  for  electric  power 
from the national grid for 2015–2020.  Figure 2.18 shows the plan for household tariff 
reductions from 2015 to 2020 with neighbouring countries as references.11,12,13 In 2015, 
the rural and urban area tariffs for electricity usage <10 kWh/month were US$0.205/
kWh and US$0.1525/kWh, respectively. The purchase-type tariffs of <10 kWh/month 
and 11–50 kWh/month had the largest tariff gaps between the rural and urban areas in 
2015. In this case, the purchase type >201 kWh/month had no gap between these two 
areas.  According  to  the  reduction  plan,  such  gap  is  expected  to  decrease  drastically  in 
2020, with the purchase type <10kWh/month. The subsidised price for only small-type 
purchases is included in the electricity tariff of neighbouring countries (Thailand, less than 
90 kWh/month; Viet Nam, less than 50 kWh/month).14,15,16 Despite the plan to decrease

the tariff for rural areas in 2020 for all purchase types, the tariff is still higher than the tariff 
in neighbouring countries.
For increasing the priority of defraying rural area electricity costs, it is recommended to 
conduct cross-subsidies between high and low electricity consumption.

At its 267th Session, held on 28 August 2014, the EAC approved a time-of-use (TOU) 
tariff for MV consumers of the EDC supply. The TOU tariff approved is shown in Table 
2.10.  The  TOU  tariff  is  optional,  which  means  it  will  be  an  applicable  option  for  MV 
consumers. For example, if a province is connected at the MV to a grid substation of the 
national grid, the tariff will be decreased from US$0.139/kWh (during the day time, 7am 
to 9pm) to US$0.095/kWh (night time, 9pm to 7am). Without the TOU, the basic tariff 
will  be  decreased  only  from  US$0.129/kWh  to  US$0.126/kWh  in  2020  by  the  tariff 
reduction  plan.  Conceptually,  this  TOU  tariff  is  applied  for  suppressing  the  electricity 
utilisation of peak demand under current circumstances. The TOU tariff is expected to 
become the time-of-day rate system in the future.

CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
Table 2.10 and Figure 2.19 show the MV tariff differences between rural, grid-connected, 
and urban areas planned until 2020, along with neighbouring countries as references.17,18 
The MV tariff of each rural, national grid, and urban area has been planned to decrease 
from 2015 to 2020. However, the electricity tariff in Cambodia is still the highest amongst 
its neighbouring countries despite TOU implementation or after the cost reduction plan 
to  2020.  In  terms  of  achieving  affordable  tariffs,  these  TOU  and  cost  reduction  plans 
should be extended to 2030.

The implementation of the TOU has a positive impact. This can be seen in Figure 2.20, 
showing peak demand curves for a whole day for 2011–2016.19 Throughout the years, 
the curves fluctuate by hours, and the consumption increases. Due to operational and 
planned reasons, a flat demand curve will benefit operators and planners who choose a 
beneficial electricity resource.
To improve this situation, two plans are recommended. The first plan is, as an example, an 
hourly base tariff system applying tariff differences between day and night periods (TOU). 
Cambodia is conducting basic actions in the agricultural sector and for MV consumers. 
Water pump tariffs for agriculture from 9pm to 7am are cheaper than during other times. 
As mentioned above, the TOU has been applied for MV consumers and is expected to be 
planned for all low-voltage (LV) consumers.

The second plan is for cross-subsidies from high-consumption users to low-consumption 
users, which increases tariff differences. According to Figure 2.18, the tariffs for electricity 
use in rural areas for the <10 kWh purchase type in 2020 will decrease more than in urban 
areas in 2020, although other purchase types of electricity will decrease to almost the same 
level as the urban tariff in 2020. Figure 2.21 and Table 2.11 show the tariff differences of 
provinces and Phnom Penh’s electrical consumption in 2017.20,21 The graph shows that 
the higher the electrical consumption, the higher the applied tariff. Hence, a tariff excess 
for higher consumption is able to subsidise a tariff for lower consumption.

CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
To  achieve  affordable  tariffs  for  residents  with  low  electricity  consumption,  the  case 
example of cross-subsidies by higher consumption is considered. Table 2.12, Table 2.13, 
Figure 2.22, and Figure 2.23  show case examples of cross-subsidies for low consumption 
from high consumption in the rural and urban areas.  The targets are set in such a way 
that the lower tariff is the same as the average of the neighbouring countries. The target 
of Case 1 is the tariff of ‘0–10 kWh/month’ of electricity consumption, ‘US$0.12/month’ 
in the provinces and rural areas, and ‘US$0.15/month’ in Phnom Penh and Takhmao of 
‘US$0.06/month’. The target of Case 2 is Case 1 and the tariff of ‘11–50 kWh/month’. 
The  target  of  Case  3  is  Case  2  and  the  tariff  of  ‘51–100  kWh/month’.  Each  case  is 
considered to be the same tariff in total. In the most aggressive case, Case 3, the additional 
tariff is +US$0.32/kWh by over 2,000 kWh/month in the provinces and rural areas. The 
tariff will be ‘0.52 kWh/month’ from ‘0.20 kWh/month’. The tariff of less than 100 kWh/
month will be the same level as for neighbouring countries.
The  acceptable  additional  tariff  in  Cambodia  can  be  estimated  based  on  the  GDP  per 
capita  for  Thailand’s  case.22  Table  2.14  shows  the  composition  by  macroeconomic 
position in 2018. The maximum cross-subsidy of Cambodia is +US$0.32/kWh (Table 
2.12). However, the 1,000 capita of cross-subsidy/GDP per capita shows +US$0.22/
kWh, which is still higher than for Thailand. If this case is acceptable, Phnom Penh and 
Takhmao (Table 2.13) hold the potential for achieving the affordable tariff of less than 100 
kWh/month via a cross-subsidy while the provinces and rural areas have the chance to 
achieve the affordable tariff of less than 50 kWh/month via the cross-subsidy. Therefore, 
the low consumers are expected to receive the benefits from the cross-subsidy from high 
consumers in Cambodia.

As described in Figure 2.21, the tariff of Cambodia is higher than that of neighbouring 
countries despite the continuing increase in electrification rate. The high rates of electricity 
tariff make Cambodia less competitive in global and regional trade and investment. One 
factor is due to high generation and transmission costs.23,24 The main cause regarding the 
generation cost is the restrictive power purchase agreements, causing unused capacity 
excess during the rainy season and investment rewards. In order to achieve an affordable 
tariff,  Cambodia  should  continue  national  grid  expansion  and  pursue  agreements  with 
neighbouring  countries  to  allow  exports  of  surplus  generation.  In  the  longer  term, 
Cambodia should actively encourage the expansion of cross-border power trading in the

GMS under the institutional arrangements in place  and, in particular, the development 
of shorter-term trading arrangements. This will provide a means for Cambodia to better 
balance supply and demand on its electricity system. 
In  most  countries  around  the  world,  there  is  a  significantly  increasing  trend  in  grid-
connected distributed generation, and also a decreasing trend in the generation cost of 
renewable energy. Therefore, it is also necessary to design a framework for considering 
grid connection. 
The  heads  of  ASEAN  power  utilities  and  authorities  are  implementing  a  study  for 
establishing  the  institution  for  the  ASEAN  Power  Grid,  named  the  APG  Generation 
and  Transmission  System  Planning  (AGTP)  and  APG  Transmission  System  Operator 
(ATSO).25 This related institution will support establishing the framework and guidelines 
for a standardised national grid amongst ASEAN countries. 
Below are the summarised targets for 2030. 
Targets by 2030
•   Prolong  the  tariff  cost  reduction  plan  from  2020  to  2030  in  terms  of  obtaining  an 
electricity tariff at an affordable price.
•   Consider  the  extension  of  a  TOU  tariff  to  LV  consumers  and  enhance  the  tariff 
differences between high and low consumption.
•   Continue  to  pursue  an  agreement  with  neighbouring  countries  allowing  exports  of 
surplus generation. 
•   Develop the guidelines for standardised grid connection.26

CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
2.4.2   Necessary action plans and policies
Achieve affordable tariffs
Extending the cost reduction plan to 2030, expanding the TOU to LV consumers, and 
cross-subsidy tariff considerations are expected to achieve affordable tariffs in Cambodia. 
Under the electricity law, there are two governmental entities responsible for regulating 
the electricity supply sector: the EAC and the MME.27 Possessing different functions and 
responsibilities, these two institutions are expected to conduct the study of a TOU tariff 
for LV consumers in the short term. As a result, the tariff will be applied accordingly with 
the type of electricity consumption.
•  Action 1: Consider cross-subsidies from high consumers to low consumers.
•  Action 2: Conduct a study of the TOU tariff for LV consumers.
Achieve low generation and distribution costs
•  Action 1: Continue to pursue an agreement with neighbouring countries allowing the 
exports of surplus generation. 
•  Action 2: Develop the guidelines for standardised grid connection.
2.4.3   Roadmap
According  to  the  necessary  action  plans  and  policies,  the  recommended  roadmap  will 
consist of three terms as follows: 
Short term, 2019–2022:
•  Consider the cross-subsidy from high consumers to low consumers.
•  Study TOU tariff for LV consumers and tariff difference expansion.
•  Study the guidelines for considering a standardised grid connection. 
•  Cite ‘cost reduction’ and ‘development distribution network’ as important legislative 
goals.

http://www.vdb-loi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cambodia-Power-Update-April-2018.pdf
52
Medium term, 2023–2026:
•  Prolong the tariff reduction plan as supported by the current study in the short term.
•  Amend the electricity regulation to operate a tariff system by the MME and EAC.
•  Establish the guidelines for a standardised grid connection.
Long term, 2027–2030:
•  MME and EAC operate a tariff system according to electricity consumption from the 
economic perspective.
•  Review on a routine basis every 2–5 years to attain further benefits of electricity.

CHAPTER 3
RENEWABLE 
ENERGY
3.1     Current situation of renewable energy
Cambodia  is  blessed  with  substantial  renewable  energy  sources  such  as  hydro,  solar, 
biomass  (including  biogas),  and  wind.  However,  these  renewable  energy  resources, 
particularly  non-hydro  renewable  energy,  have  not  yet  been  tapped  to  fulfil  energy 
demand  in  Cambodia.  The  total  primary  energy  supply  (TPES)  in  2015  was  7  million 
tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe), supplied by renewable energy (mostly biomass) (62.4%), 
oil (27.4%), coal (8.3%), and electricity imports (1.9%). In terms of electricity, the total 
installed capacity in 2015 was 1,657.2 megawatts (MW), coming from hydro (56.1%), 
coal (24.3%), oil (18.4%), and biomass (1.2%). 
Hydropower
(1) 
In  2006,  the  Ministry  for  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy  (now  known  as  the  Ministry  of 
Mines and Energy) and the Cambodian National Mekong Committee (CNMC) reviewed 
hydropower  and  identified  60  possible  sites  for  hydro  development  in  Cambodia  with 
the potential for approximately 10,000 MW of power generation, of which 50% was on 
the  mainstream  Mekong,  40%  on  its  tributaries,  and  10%  in  the  southwest  outside  the 
Mekong Basin. There are about 63 possible sites for small and large hydropower projects 
throughout  the  country.  However,  currently  only  around  1,330  MW  has  been  tapped, 
which is only 13% of the potential, and other projects are under development and feasibility 
studies. The production of electricity from hydropower dams has increased significantly 
in  recent  years.  For  example,  hydropower  electricity  production  in  2011  was  just  51.5 
gigawatt hours (GWh) and increased almost 50 times to 2567.9 GWh in 2016.
55
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
Biomass (including biogas)
(2) 
The potential of biomass mostly comes from a variety of agricultural residues, such as rice 
husks, cassava, coconuts, and animal waste. Biomass is commonly used in rural areas for 
cooking.  Rural  households  still  rely  on  traditional  biomass  energy,  mainly  fuelwood,  as 
their primary cooking fuel. However, most households burn biomass in traditional ways, 
by using traditional and inefficient stoves, which produce toxic smoke that pollutes the air 
inside and outside homes. The toxic smoke can be a major health risk factor in Cambodia, 
such  as  for  asthma  and  acute  respiratory  infections,  particularly  amongst  children.  A 
number of studies show that the use of solid fuels, especially amongst households in rural 
areas, is closely linked to a high incidence of respiratory diseases. To reduce or mitigate 
such household pollution, improved or advanced stoves that burn biomass in cleaner and 
more efficient ways should be promoted. 
Biogas from animal waste for generating high-quality gas for lighting and cooking has been 
used by rural households. Around 25,383 biogas digesters with capacities varying from 2 
m3 to 15 m3 were constructed in rural areas until 2016.
In  terms  of  electricity,  Cambodia  has  used  biomass  power  plants  since  2006  with  an 
installed capacity of 4.50 MW, and this has gradually increased to around 22.64 MW in 
2016. 
Solar
(3) 
The average solar radiation in Cambodia is around 5 kWh/day, with an average sunshine 
duration of 6–9 hours per day, or around 1,400–1,800 kWh/m2. At present, one solar 
photovoltaic  (PV)  unit  of  10  MW  has  been  installed  and  connected  to  the  grid,  and 
another three solar PV units with a total capacity of 25 MW are under development. In 
addition, since 2012, around 48,980 units (5–50 W peak) of solar home systems with a 
total capacity of 625 kW have been installed in rural areas.
The  2016  Mekong  Strategic  Partners  report  projected  the  potential  for  solar  PV  in 
Cambodia  to  be  700  MW,  which  can  be  installed  on  1,400  hectares  of  land.  Solar  PV 
projects are projected to increase. However, as land is a sensitive issue in Cambodia, the 
development of rooftop solar PV is potentially to be developed for residential buildings 
and also existing dam reservoirs instead of land.
56
(4)  Wind
Cambodia’s  wind  potential  is  located  mostly  in  the  southern  part  of  the  great  lake 
Tonley Sap, the mountainous districts in the southwest and the coastal regions, such as 
Sihanoukville, Kampot, Kep, and Koh Kong, which have an annual average wind speed of 
5 m/s.
3.2     Major issues
Electricity  demand  in  Cambodia  has  grown  at  an  average  of  nearly  20%  per  year  since 
2010.  Electricity  demand  is  mostly  supplied  by  large-scale  hydropower  and  coal-fired 
power  plants.  Although  Cambodia  has  the  potential  for  non-hydro  renewable  energy, 
such as biomass, wind, and solar, non-hydro renewable energy is not yet utilised optimally 
due to barriers such as higher up-front costs and no clear target for renewable energy in 
the energy mix.
No clear target
(1) 
Renewable  energy  targets  are  defined  as  numerical  goals  established  by  governments 
to  achieve  a  specific  amount  of  renewable  energy  production  or  consumption  in  the 
entire energy mix (TPES or total final energy consumption [TFES]). They can apply to 
electricity or heating/cooling or to the energy sector as a whole. For example, Indonesia 
has set a renewable energy target of 23% by 2025 and Thailand of 40% by 2036, while 
ASEAN’s renewable energy target is 23% by 2025. A renewable energy target sends an 
important  signal  to  stakeholders,  and  it  plays  a  significant  role  in  informing  investment 
decisions.  Renewable  energy  targets  contribute  to  developing  a  clearer  vision  for  the 
development of the sector and enable stakeholders to allocate funding more effectively. 
Specific design issues for policymakers to consider include whether the target should be 
established in absolute terms (a specific quantity of energy to be supplied) or relative to a 
moving baseline (i.e., in percentage terms) and whether electricity targets should be set 
in capacity (megawatts) or in output (megawatt-hour) terms. Renewable energy targets 
need to be accompanied by a clear strategy and backed by specific policies and measures.
Although the Government of Cambodia has issued policies and regulations in the energy 
sector,  some  of  which  are  linked  to  renewable  energy  utilisation,  the  government  has 
not yet set a national target for renewable energy utilisation. This means there is no clear 
signal to stakeholders, particularly to the private sector, to convince them or to guarantee 
that  their  investments  in  renewable  energy  projects  will  give  them  benefits  and  profit, 
especially for the national energy supply security.

Lack of policy and regulations to support the promotion of renewable 
energy utilisation
 
The Government of Cambodia is committed to implementing sustainable energy security. 
The government has set up the Cambodia Energy Policy, which aims to provide an adequate 
supply of energy throughout Cambodia at a reasonable and affordable price; to ensure a 
reliable and secure electricity supply at a reasonable price, which facilitates investment 
in  Cambodia  and  the  development  of  the  national  economy;  to  encourage  exploration 
and the environmentally and socially acceptable development of energy sources needed 
for supply to all sectors of the Cambodian economy; and to encourage the efficient use 
of energy and to minimise the detrimental environmental effects resulting from energy 
supply and consumption. 
The government has also set up policy targets: by 2020, 100% of villages in the country 
should have access to electricity, and by 2030, at least 70% of the total households in the 
country should have access to quality grid-supplied electricity. Achieving these targets 
will depend on the utilisation of all types of electricity sources and the participation of the 
relevant stakeholders.
The  Electricity  Law  (2001)  provides  the  governing  framework  for  the  electricity  power 
supply and services throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia. The law covers all activities 
related to the supply of electricity, provision of services, and use of electricity and other 
associated activities in the power sector.
The  National  Policy  on  Rural  Electrification  by  renewable  energy  has  the  objectives  of 
providing  clean,  reliable,  safe,  and  reasonably  priced  electricity  in  rural  areas  based  on 
primarily renewable energy in a fair and equitable way. 
The Development Plan 2008–2021 projects that 2,770 MW will be constructed in 2020, 
of which 2,241 MW will be supplied by hydropower.
The  National  Climate  Change  Strategic  Plan  2014–2023  is  a  comprehensive  national 
policy that promotes the use of renewable energy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. 
The Government of Cambodia has made a major commitment to reducing the carbon 
intensity of its energy sector as part of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 
(INDC). Under its INDC, Cambodia proposed a contribution to mitigating greenhouse 
gases, conditional upon the availability of support from the international community, of a 
16% reduction from the 2030 energy sector business-as-usual scenario. The priorities of 
the INDC actions are the following:
58
•  national grid-connected renewable energy generation (solar energy, hydro, biomass, 
and biogas);
•  connecting decentralised renewable generation to the grid;
•  off-grid electricity, such as solar home systems, hydro (pico, micro, and mini); and
•  promoting energy efficiency by end users.
In  2013,  Prime  Minister  Hun  Sen  launched  the  Cambodian  Climate  Change  Strategic 
Plan 2014–2023, the National Policy for Green Growth 2013–2030, and the National 
Strategic Plan for Green Growth 2013–2030, all of which propose policy actions in the 
energy  sector  that  can  support  greener,  more  inclusive  growth,  including  increasing 
renewable energy deployment, facilitating loans for sustainable projects, and improving 
the energy efficiency of industries and households.
To  realise  sustainable  energy  security,  particularly  in  the  field  of  the  power  sector, 
the  government  set  up  strategies  for  developing  generation  through  increasing  the 
diversification  of  the  power  supply,  such  as  through  hydro,  coal  power,  importing 
electricity, and other renewable energy sources (biomass, solar, and wind), to meet the 
electricity demand and reduce oil for power generation. However, since there is no specific 
target for the renewable energy share in the national energy mix and no clear regulation or 
policy, the renewable energy business in Cambodia is relatively low, particularly for non-
hydro.
The  Government  of  Cambodia  ratified  the  Paris  Agreement  in  2016  and  has  agreed 
to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  but  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions, 
particularly  in  the  energy  sector,  cannot  be  achieved  without  increasing  the  utilisation 
of renewable energy significantly. Therefore, sustainable energy security, environmental 
protection, and climate change mitigation in Cambodia are major drivers for scaling up 
renewable  energy  deployment.  The  government  should  take  action  to  develop  strong 
policies, regulations, and incentives for investors to make them more interested in investing 
in the renewable energy industry. Cambodia has some good experience in implementing 
renewable  energy  projects,  but  it  needs  to  develop  policy  instruments  based  on  the 
lessons learned in other countries that have already successfully implemented renewable 
energy projects. The Ministry of Mines and Energy of Cambodia, together with related 
institutions, such as the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Finance, and the Electricity 
Authority of Cambodia, will start drafting regulations and incentives for renewable energy, 
such  as  feed-in  tariffs  (FITs),  reducing  import  taxes  on  renewable  energy  technology/
equipment, financing support mechanisms, the simplification of permit procedures, and 
grid system and renewable energy standards. 
59
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
3.3     Assessment of the voluntary renewable energy target
Electricity demand in Cambodia has been increasing significantly by around 18% annually 
from  2010  to  2016.  Coal  (29%)  and  hydro  (52%)  are  two  primary  sources  of  power, 
together accounting for 81% of the total installed capacity in 2017, while other renewable 
power  plants  using  wood  and  other  biomass  comprised  only  5%.  The  total  installed 
capacity was 1,867 MW. Cambodia does not have fossil energy resources, so for its coal 
and diesel power generation, the country imports coal and fuel oil from other countries. 
To  strengthen  the  national  energy  security  of  supply  as  well  as  to  achieve  the  national 
target of emission reduction as already stated in the INDC, the Government of Cambodia 
should increase the use of renewable energy, which is locally available. The government 
should reduce the use of coal and diesel power plants. Based on the Cambodia Energy 
Outlook,  the  most  possible  energy  mix  in  the  year  2030  comprises  hydro  at  55%  and 
non-hydro renewable energy at 10% (biomass, solar PV, and wind) of the projected total 
electricity output of 26.2 TWh.
3.4     Necessary renewable energy policies
To achieve the target as mentioned, there needs to be strong regulation.
Hydro
(1) 
The average production cost of electricity from hydropower is less than US$0.07/kWh, 
which is less than the national electricity tariff of US$0.20/kWh. So, from the economical 
point  of  view,  there  is  no  need  for  the  government  to  issue  new  regulation,  since 
hydropower  can  be  developed  on  a  commercial  basis.  However,  hydropower  projects 
are always subject to environmental issues. Most hydropower project developments are 
strongly  opposed  by  environmentalists  and  local  people.  Even  a  common  study  by  the 
Mekong  River  Commission  shows  that  dam  construction  has  negative  impacts  on  the 
riparian  ecosystem,  sustainability,  and  food  security  associated  with  fish  production  in 
Cambodia. In order to maximise the use of hydropower but minimise its negative impacts, 
the  government  needs  to  have  strategies  on  how  to  mitigate  the  predicted  negative 
impacts.  For  such  purposes,  the  government  should  issue  regulations  that  guarantee 
that  hydropower  project  developments  comply  with  all  steps  to  achieve  a  high-quality 
environmental impact assessment and also a transparent decision-making process.
60
(2)  Wiser use of biomass through efficient cooking stoves
As mentioned, many rural households rely on biomass, particularly for cooking, by using 
simple traditional cooking stoves (three big stones). Unaware of the harmful effects of 
household  air  pollution,  the  users  of  firewood  stoves  expose  themselves  daily  to  toxic 
smoke, increasing the risk of asthma, lung tuberculosis, and acute respiratory infections, 
particularly amongst children. A World Health Organization publication (2018) estimates 
that over 4 million people around the globe die each year from using traditional cooking 
stoves. Realising the importance of biomass in rural areas, the Government of Cambodia 
has taken action since some years ago to examine how to use biomass/fuelwood in efficient 
ways as well as tackle indoor pollution. There are several improved cookstoves that have 
already been introduced to rural households, such as the New Lao Stove introduced by 
the Group for the Environment, Renewable Energy and Solidarity in 2003. The New Lao 
Stove  is  more  resistant  and  consumes  less  biomass  fuel,  using  22%  less  fuelwood,  and 
each stove saves 0.4 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year. In 10 years until 2013, 2 million 
New Lao Stove units have been distributed by the Group for the Environment, Renewable 
Energy and Solidarity. Promoting the wide use of efficient biomass cookstoves, particularly 
in rural areas, requires strong policies and regulations that emphasise improving energy 
access  for  remote  and  poor  populations.  The  policies  and  regulations  should  be  able 
to create an enabling environment for developing the biomass cookstove business and 
markets by providing incentives.
The Ministry of Energy and Mining of Cambodia should take the lead in developing a road 
map or a master plan to scale up access to clean biomass cooking stoves and developing 
national standards, testing, and certifications for biomass cookstoves.
Gradual increase of solar PV and wind
(3) 
At present, the use of solar PV and wind power generation in Cambodia is small compared 
to other countries, both in the ASEAN region and internationally. The development of 
solar PV generation is expected to improve the overall energy sector in Cambodia. With 
the relatively high potential of solar PV and wind power in Cambodia, it is projected that 
solar PV and wind power will gradually increase, both to strengthen the security of the 
energy supply and to tackle climate change. The projection is also supported by the decline 
in cost. The International Renewable Energy Agency states that from 2010 to 2017, the 
cost of solar fell by 60% and wind by 40%. The predicted cost will continue to fall because 
of more efficient designs and advances in materials and manufacturing. Solar rooftops will 
also increase because of the price of land. However, to scale up solar PV and wind power 
projects  will  require  huge  investment.  Therefore,  cooperation  and  collaboration  with 
international financing are strongly needed, such as from the Asian Development Bank, 
61

World Bank, USAID, Japan International Cooperation Agency, European countries, KfW 
of Germany, and Agence Française de Développement of France.
Introduction of existing renewable energy policies
(4) 
In general, renewable energy is mostly claimed to have a high cost of production, which 
results in a cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity that is relatively expensive compared with 
that  of  conventional  power  plants.  On  the  contrary,  renewable  energy  is  clean  energy, 
which  means  the  emissions  from  renewable  energy  are  very  low  compared  to  fossil 
energy.  However,  there  are  still  some  barriers  facing  the  development  of  renewable 
energy projects. To increase renewable energy utilisation, the barriers should be removed 
by  creating  an  enabling  policy  environment  that  can  encourage  the  private  sector  to 
participate  in  investment  in  the  renewable  energy  projects.  Countries  with  a  low  level 
of  renewable  energy  development  and  small-scale  projects,  such  as  Cambodia,  need 
regulations to scale up renewable energy deployment. 
In many countries around the world, such as in Europe, the United States, Japan, India, 
and  ASEAN  countries  such  as  Thailand,  the  Philippines,  Indonesia,  and  Malaysia, 
governments have issued various policies and regulations to scale up renewable energy 
deployment. Various regulations have been implemented in many countries, such as FITs, 
Renewable  Portfolio  Standards  (RPS),  net  metering  systems,  and  other  incentives  to 
encourage and scale up renewable energy business.
Renewable Portfolio Standards
1) 
RPS mandate that certain percentages of all electricity in the country come from renewable 
energy sources. The RPS mechanism commonly places an obligation on electricity supply 
companies  to  produce  a  specified  fraction  of  their  electricity  from  renewable  energy 
sources. The RPS can be achieved through three mechanisms: (1) by producing renewable 
energy itself, (2) by purchasing renewable energy produced by another supplier, or (3) by 
buying  renewable  energy  credit  certificates.  These  certificates  are  issued  to  renewable 
energy  producers  based  on  the  amount  of  energy  they  feed  into  the  grid.  Selling  the 
certificates is another way for renewable energy producers to supplement their revenue. 
The RPS encourages the development of renewable energy markets by ensuring that some 
specified minimum amount of renewable energy is included in the supplier’s portfolio of 
generating  fuels.  The  RPS  can  play  an  integral  role  in  a  country’s  efforts  to  diversify  its 
energy mix, promote domestic energy production, and reduce emissions. However, the 
RPS can cause electricity price increases because, in many cases, the cost of electricity 
from  renewable  energy  is  higher  than  that  of  conventional  energy.  This  means  that 
consumers  will  spend  more  for  electricity.  In  addition,  the  RPS  need  transmission  and 
integration system upgrades to enable the absorption of more electricity from renewable 
energy.  Because  of  the  intermittent  nature  of  renewable  energy,  in  terms  of  planning 
62
reserves,  as  the  amount  of  variable  generation  gets  added  to  the  electricity  system,  it 
is  possible  that  more  fossil  peak-power  generation  will  be  needed  in  order  to  maintain 
reserve requirements.
The RPS mechanism has been adopted in many countries. For example, Germany set the 
RPS at 18%, 30%, and 60%, respectively, in 2020, 2030, and 2050. 
Feed-in tariffs
2) 
FITs are an instrument for encouraging large-scale renewable energy projects since they 
provide a stable income to developers. A FIT is a fixed price or standard purchasing price 
that  is  paid  to  renewable  energy  producers  for  each  unit  of  electricity  produced  and 
injected into the electricity grid. A FIT is intended to encourage the adoption of renewable 
energy by overcoming the high upfront costs of renewable energy projects. FITs offer an 
effective way of achieving the RPS. FITs are usually differentiated from renewable energy 
technology  due  to  the  differences  in  generation  costs  between  the  renewable  energy 
technology. FITs are also used for the size of the renewable energy project, such as for 
small and medium capacity. 
The payment of the FIT is guaranteed for a certain period of time, which is often related 
to the economic lifetime of the respective renewable energy project. A FIT is usually paid 
by the electricity grid system or market operators in the long-term contract of the power 
purchase agreement.
The  level  of  a  FIT  is  determined  on  the  basis  of  a  calculation  of  the  levelised  cost  of 
electricity produced from renewable energy. This allows the renewable energy investor 
to  recover  the  different  costs  (capital,  operation  and  maintenance,  fuel,  and  finances) 
while realising a return on the investment that depends on the assumed financing cost. It 
is also possible to determine the FIT level by means of a tendering mechanism. As a FIT is 
a cost-based price, the price for a renewable energy-based power plant will be higher than 
for a conventional-based power plant or national electricity tariff. As a consequence, the 
government should allocate budget to cover the gap; or the FIT can be passed through to 
consumers, and it is possible to increase the electricity tariff. 
When introducing a FIT, some key components must be considered:
•  Determining a good tariff rate. If the tariff rate is too high, producers will benefit more, 
but the government will bear or provide more subsidies, or consumers will pay a higher 
electricity tariff. If the tariff rate is too low, there will be little or no investment.
Imposing a priority purchase obligation for renewable energy. Grid operators should 
prioritise  connecting  and  transmitting  electricity  from  renewable  resources  before 
energy from other sources.
• 
63
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
•  Guaranteed tariff rates for a specific time period/length of contract. This ensures the 
security of investment for producers, investors, and suppliers.
•  Determining the renewable energy technologies to be covered.
•  The size of the eligible project.
The advantages of FITs include the following:
•  Guaranteed long-term contracts (usually 15–20 years).
• 
Increased  drive  for  technology  innovation.  Good  FIT  rates  for  renewable  energy 
encourage investment in renewable energy business.
•  Secure domestic energy supply. Countries will become less dependent on imported 
fossil fuels when the domestic renewable energy supply market expands.
•  Creation  of  jobs.  The  growth  of  the  renewable  energy  market  will  increase  job 
opportunities. Analysis by the International Renewable Energy Agency has shown that 
the renewable energy sector is already creating jobs across Southeast Asia, estimated 
at 611,000 jobs in 2016, of which 362 jobs were in bioenergy, while the rest were in 
hydropower, solar, wind, and geothermal energy. 
•  Reduction of CO2 emissions because renewable energy is from clean energy sources.
•  Enables renewable energy technologies to compete with conventional energy sources.
•  Easier for developers to get project financing.
The disadvantages of FITs include the following:
•  Likely to cause an increase in the cost of electricity for customers unless subsidies or 
incentives are available.
•  Utilities need to improve their grid system to enable absorbing more renewable energy.
REN  21  (2014)  states  that  73  countries  have  adopted  FITs.  The  lessons  learned  from 
many countries, such as Germany, Denmark, Spain, Japan, India, Thailand, Indonesia, 
the Philippines, and Malaysia show that FITs have proven to be very effective in speeding 
the transitions to the use of renewable energy for producing electricity and also for helping 
society  to  effectively  address  climate  change.  The  example  of  Japan’s  FIT  is  shown  in 
Table 3.1.

Net metering
3) 
Net  metering  is  a  billing  mechanism  that  credits  solar  energy  system  owners  for  the 
electricity they add to the grid. If residential customers have a PV system on their house 
rooftops, they may generate more electricity than the home uses during daylight hours. 
If  the  home  is  net-metered,  the  electricity  meter  will  run  backward  to  provide  a  credit 
against what electricity is consumed at night or other periods where the home’s electricity 
use exceeds the system’s output. Customers are only billed for their ‘net’ energy use. 
Net  metering  allows  utility  consumers  to  generate  their  own  electricity  cleanly  and 
efficiently.  Net  metering  is  more  suitable  for  small-scale  renewable-based  distributed 
generation.  During  the  day,  most  solar  consumers  produce  more  electricity  than  they 
consume, which allows them to export that power to the grid and reduce their future bills. 
As such, solar PV enables local self-consumption that can deliver savings to the grid. This 
can result in a significant reduction in the monthly electricity consumption of the owner 
of a solar PV system. It can complement the grid and provide benefits and potential cost 
reductions for both the end consumers and the grid system. A net metering system is easy 
65
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
and inexpensive. With the net metering system, the installed solar PV does not need a 
battery backup to store power, meaning that the investment for the solar PV system can be 
reduced. Net metering increases demand for solar energy systems, which in turn creates 
jobs for the installers, electricians, and manufacturers who work in the solar supply chain.
However, for utility companies, the net metering system means shrinking profits because 
consumers buy less power from the utility.
Financial and fiscal incentives
4) 
Financial and fiscal incentives are aimed at decreasing the production cost of renewable 
energy  projects  and  increasing  their  affordability  and  bankability.  Financial  and  fiscal 
incentives  are  needed  to  improve  access  to  capital,  lower  financing  costs,  and  reduce 
the burden of the high upfront costs of large-scale renewable energy projects. They can 
be  in  the  form  of  tax  incentives,  rebates,  or  grants.  Tax  incentives  are  typically  offered 
in  the  form  of  a  reduction  in  value-added,  tax  allowance/accelerated  depreciation,  or 
investment tax credit. Tax incentives can reduce the cost of renewable energy systems for 
the developer and can increase their affordability and profitability. Many countries have 
adopted tax incentives to increase renewable energy deployment.

Rural electrification
5) 
Cambodia as a developing country has many rural areas that have not yet been reached by 
the national grid. To increase access to electricity, using locally available renewable energy 
may be a solution. However, the development of renewable energy-based power plants in 
rural areas may not be commercially viable because people’s ability to pay is low.
The  Government  of  Cambodia  has  set  an  electrification  target  of  increasing  the  level 
of  villages’  access  to  grid-quality  electricity  to  100%  by  2020;  and  at  least  70%  of  all 
households  in  Cambodia  are  to  have  access  to  grid-quality  electricity  by  2030.  This 
means that in 2030, it is projected that around 30% of households will not have access to 
the grid, and these households will mostly be in rural areas that face difficulty or high costs 
of being reached by the grid system. For such areas, the implementation of standalone 
or  decentralised  systems  using  renewable  energy  is  an  appropriate  option.  Solar  home 
systems,  for  example,  are  standalone  systems,  and  micro  hydropower  and  solar  PV 
decentralised systems may be economical for remote rural households that do not have 
access to the grid for long periods. 
Since  the  production  cost  of  renewable  energy-based  power  plants  is  high,  and  the 
electricity  price  from  renewable  energy  is  higher,  the  high  cost  of  providing  services  to 
remote  areas  and  the  low  consumption  mean  that  rural  electrification  schemes  are 
usually more costly than urban schemes. However, it seems there is a strong correlation 
between rural poverty and access to electricity because electricity is a pre-requisite for 
productive activities. Rural electricity programmes seem to be crucial for implementing 
improved  living  conditions  and  promoting  production  and  better  health  and  education 
for households. However, the electricity tariffs in rural areas do not need to be the same 
as in urban areas. Rural electricity tariffs should be set at a level that is affordable for the 
majority of customers. Therefore, to increase the access of rural people to electricity, the 
government should support rural electrification programmes through collaboration with 
international banks. For such purposes, the Government of Cambodia, supported by the 
World Bank, established the Rural Electrification Fund (REF) in 2004. The REF is intended 
to  provide  grants  for  promoting  rural  electrification  by  renewable  energy  technologies. 
The REF has facilitated access by rural people to electricity through solar home systems by 
providing subsidies of US$100 per solar home system unit. With the subsidy, solar home 
systems have become more competitive in rural areas. 
Since  the  government’s  funding  for  rural  electrification  is  limited,  to  accelerate  the 
implementation  of  rural  electrification  programmes,  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Energy 
should  actively  seek  international  support  such  as  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 
the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  USAID,  Global  Environment  Facility,  the 
Carbon Fund of the World Bank, and from European countries, such as Germany’s GIZ, 
68
Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Finland, and Norway, which provide some assistance 
to  developing  countries  to  develop  rural  electrification.  In  addition,  the  government 
should take into consideration the open access of rural people to microfinance.
3.5     Recommendations
Based on Cambodia’s energy situation, in order to speed up the deployment of renewable 
energy,  the  government  needs  to  take  action,  particularly  in  setting  up  policy  and 
regulations. For such purposes, we recommended the following measures:
• 
In the short and medium terms
:  Set up a target for renewable energy in the energy mix for 2030.
:  Set up regulations on environmental issues for hydropower development.
:  Set  up  regulations  for  using  biomass-efficient  cooking  stoves  and  developing 
national  standards,  testing,  and  certifications  for  biomass  cookstoves.  The 
government,  through  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Energy,  should  actively  seek 
international funding resources (grants and soft loans).
• 
In the medium and long terms
:  Study to apply FITs (up to a certain capacity, for example a capacity up to 10 MW) 
for biomass, solar, and wind power generation.
:  Study to apply a net metering system to encourage the use of solar rooftops.
:  Study to apply renewable portfolio standards and financing and fiscal incentives.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AND CONSERVATION
4.1     Introduction
Energy is fundamental to a nation’s economic development and progress, and it is needed 
for  industry,  commercial,  and  residential  activities  besides  transportation.  Therefore, 
energy security is critical to any nation. Energy efficiency (EE) as discussed in this chapter 
includes energy efficiency and conservation (EEC). EE may not be attractive as it is not 
straightforward, and achieving it may involve a combination of measures and technical 
and  financial  understanding.  It  may  also  involve  developing  an  effective  plan  for  the 
efficient  utilisation  of  energy.  Nevertheless,  according  to  a  report  by  the  International 
Energy Agency (IEA, 2018), it is becomingly increasingly clear that EE can bring many 
significant economic and environmental benefits.
The  energy  savings  brought  about  by  EE  improvement  strategies  can  yield  a  range  of 
benefits. The benefits of holistic and effective EE plans can be summarised as follows: 
(1) 
Efficient utilisation of energy will improve the self-sufficiency of the energy supply 
and, hence, energy security.
Efficient  utilisation  of  electricity  will  delay  the  planting  up  of  power  plants  and, 
hence,  reduce  the  financing  burden  on  the  nation  and  improve  the  energy 
economics. 
(2) 
(3)  Government policies and energy plans on energy EE will help business organisations 
improve  their  energy  performance,  thus  reducing  both  energy  consumption  and 
costs,  which  can  translate  into  improved  productivity,  eventually  resulting  in 
improved national energy intensity.
70
(4) 
Efficient utilisation of energy will help improve the availability of electricity as the 
available  power  supply  capacities  can  reach  out  to  a  greater  proportion  of  the 
population.  In  addition,  savings  in  electricity  can  delay  the  planting  up  of  new 
power plants, which can translate into savings in the financing costs of investments 
for new power plants.
(5)  An overall reduction in national energy intensity will make positive contributions 
toward  reducing  the  depletion  of  energy  resources  and  mitigating  the  effects  of 
energy  use,  such  as  reductions  in  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and  global 
warming.
According to the IEA, EE is ‘the first fuel’. Strong EE policies are vital for achieving the 
key  energy-policy  goals  of  reducing  energy  bills,  addressing  climate  change,  improving 
energy security, and increasing energy access. Figure 4.1 shows a summary of the multiple 
benefits of energy efficiency.

4.2     Review of the current situation
Based  on  the  historical  data  from  2010  to  2015,  as  reported  by  ERIA  (2016),  energy 
consumption in Cambodia has been increasing, as illustrated in Figures 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 
4.5. The demand for electricity by the residential, commercial, and industry sectors has 
seen a steeper rise in consumption compared with the overall final energy consumption by 
all sectors. Figure 4.5 shows that electricity consumption by the residential, commercial, 
industry, and other sectors in 2015 was more than 2.3 times the demand in 2010.

Figure 4.6 shows the percentage shares of energy sources for the residential, commercial, 
and industry sectors. However, based on the current trend in energy demand, it is expected 
that the share of electricity as an energy source will increase, as illustrated in Figure 4.7. 
The share of electricity demand in 2030 is projected to increase to about 27% from 10% in 
2015 under the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario.

4.3     Review of energy demand trends
4.3.1   Residential sector
The residential sector consumes much more energy than the commercial and industry 
sectors, at about 73% of the total energy consumption by these three sectors (residential, 
commercial, and industry) in 2015. As shown in Figure 4.8, biomass was the main source 
of energy that catered for the residential sector in 2015, at about 87%. Electricity was next 
at about 7%, while oil products catered to the remaining demand at 6%. Energy demand 
for the residential sector is projected to increase. As shown in Figures 4.8 and 4.9, the 
energy demand by the residential sector by 2030 is projected under the BAU scenario to 
reach 4.39 Mtoe with an annual average growth rate of 2.3%. Under the alternative policy 
scenario (APS), the energy demand by 2030 is projected to be 3.9 Mtoe with an annual 
average growth rate of 1.5%. Under the energy efficiency framework (EEF) scenario, the 
energy demand by 2030 is projected to be 3.73 Mtoe at an annual average growth rate of 
1.2%.

4.3.2   Commercial sector
Amongst  the  three  sectors  (residential,  commercial,  and  industry),  the  total  energy 
demand for the commercial sector is the lowest. In 2015, the commercial sector comprised 
about 3% of the total demand of the three sectors. However, the rate of increase in the 
projected  demand  by  this  sector  is  high,  at  an  annual  average  growth  rate  of  6.1%.  By 
2030, the total demand by the commercial sector is projected to increase to 0.29 Mtoe 
from 0.12 Mtoe in 2015 under the BAU scenario as shown in Figure 4.10. Similarly, under 
the APS scenario, the total demand is projected to increase to 0.25 Mtoe at an annual 
average growth rate of 5.2%, while under the EEF scenario, the total demand is projected 
to increase to 0.24 Mtoe at an annual average growth rate of 4.9%. Therefore, in view of 
this high projected growth rate, it will be strategic and beneficial to implement EEC plans 
for the commercial sector.

4.3.3   Industry sector
The industry sector consumes the second-largest share of total energy demand amongst 
the  three  sectors  at  about  24%,  compared  with  73%  and  3%  for  the  residential  and 
commercial sectors, respectively. However, the annual growth rate is not as high as that of 
the commercial sector. The projected total demand for the industry sector is 1.45 Mtoe 
by 2030 at an annual average growth rate of 2.3% under the BAU scenario, as shown in 
Figure 4.11. Similarly, the projected total demand for the industry sector is 1.29 Mtoe 
at an annual average growth rate of 1.5% under the APS scenario, while under the EEF 
scenario, the projected total demand is 1.24 Mtoe at an annual average growth rate of 
1.2%. Although the growth rate is not as high as that of the commercial sector, it is still 
important  to  implement  EE  plans  for  the  industry  sector  as  the  total  demand  for  this 
sector is relatively substantial.

4.4    Energy efficiency strategies
It  would  be  prudent  to  review  and  interpret  the  energy  data  and  trends  in  the  energy 
demand  before  establishing  EE  strategies  or  setting  priorities  for  the  implementation 
of EE policies. Based on the review of the current situation and energy demand trends 
discussed above, it is important to note that the following energy situations are prevalent 
in Cambodia under the BAU scenario:
(1) 
Energy demand for the residential, commercial, and industry sectors is on a rising 
trend.
(2)  The annual average growth rate of energy demand for the commercial sector is the 
highest at 6.1%.
(3)  The percentage share of electricity demand for the three sectors will increase from 
its 2015 level of 10% to 27% by 2030.
(4)  The percentage share of the biomass energy source will decrease from its 2015 level 
of 67% to 48% by 2030, but the combined fuel energy sources, comprising biomass, 
charcoal, LPG, and diesel, will still be significant at 73% of the total demand for the 
three sectors by 2030.
78
(5)  The residential sector consumes the largest share of energy demand amongst the 
three  sectors  at  about  70.5%,  while  the  industry  sector  consumes  the  second-
largest share at about 23% in 2015 under the BAU scenario. The share of energy 
demand by the residential sector is projected to increase to 71.6%, and, similarly, 
the industry sector is projected to increase to 23.7% by 2030.
In view of the trends in energy demand summarised above, policymakers may consider a 
holistic and systematic approach to formulating and implementing short, medium, and 
long-term EEC plans for the efficient use of various energy sources. Figure 4.12 provides 
an  overview  of  a  recommended  strategic  framework  for  formulating  an  EEC  plan.  The 
strategic  framework  comprises  four  core  strategy  areas,  namely,  energy  economics,  a 
social and legal framework, the environment, and an EEC implementation structure. The 
details are described in the following sub-sections. In order to be effective and achievable, 
the  EEC  plan  should  be  formulated  based  on  a  top-down  approach,  both  from  the 
government’s perspective and the private sector’s perspective. Nevertheless, the EEC plan 
should be kept simple, practical, and cost-effective, although EE is not straightforward 
when compared with renewable energy.

CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
4.4.1   Energy economics
It  should  be  recognised  that  EE  plans  will  yield  energy  savings.  EE  alone  can  deliver 
substantial  economic,  environmental,  and  social  benefits  (IEA,  2018).  The  energy 
saved can be translated into an energy resource for the nation as it will become energy 
available  for  other  economic  activities  and  provide  energy  supply  to  a  greater  share  of 
the population. The savings in electricity consumption are even more significant as every 
electricity unit of kilowatt hours saved would result in greater savings in fuel energy from 
power generation. Based on the outlook for energy demand summarised above, it makes 
economic sense for Cambodia to embark on EEC plans. The benefits of the EEC plans 
highlighted  in  Section  4.1  of  this  report  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  Cambodian 
economy. It can be seen from Figure 4.13 that an 11% reduction in total energy demand 
can be targeted under the APS case, while a 15% reduction in total energy demand can be 
targeted under the EEF case in comparison with the BAU case by 2030. In other words, 
energy demand will be much greater in future if Cambodia does not embark on an EEC 
plan now.

The economic component of the EEC strategy would result in promoting the growth of 
EEC  technology,  equipment,  and  materials  supply.  In  addition,  Cambodia  will  benefit 
from skilled manpower capacity building as a result of the EEC plan implementation, which 
will generate demand for upgraded levels of skilled employment. Therefore, it would be 
prudent to adopt strong policies to promote and enable EE investments at a reasonable 
scale.  According  to  the  IEA  (2018),  all  investment  opportunities  in  the  efficient  world 
scenario are highly cost-effective and would bring significant economic benefits.
4.4.2   Social and legal framework
From  the  national  perspective,  the  top-down  approach  is  through  the  government’s 
plan to establish legal frameworks, such as an EEC act or regulations, which should be 
planned  as  the  ‘push’  factor  instead  of  a  legal  framework  to  mete  out  penalties.  The 
objective of having legal frameworks is to establish mandatory requirements for efficient 
energy management and also to empower the department or agency that is tasked with 
the  responsibilities  for  implementing  EEC  plans  and,  consequently,  achieving  EE  and 
productivity for Cambodia.  
For  the  private  sector,  the  top-down  approach  requires  top  management  or  owners  of 
companies  to  undertake  efficient  energy  management  practices.  The  legal  framework 
would require business operations that exceed a certain threshold value of annual energy 
consumption  to  adopt  an  energy  management  system  or  practices.  The  results  of  EE 
practices and energy productivity will eventually benefit business operations. 
The  top-down  approach  may  not  be  applicable  for  the  residential  sector,  except  for 
the legislative building codes, which would require housing developers to build energy-
efficient houses and apartments. Similarly, building codes will also cover the commercial 
sector in terms of energy-efficient buildings. In this regard, the top-down approach will be 
an important strategy under the social and legal framework strategy.
As part of the social strategies, it is important to create an EEC culture by incorporating 
EE subjects in education curriculums and conducting EE promotional campaigns for the 
public in the residential sector and awareness and capacity-building training programmes 
for the commercial and industry sectors.
81
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
4.4.3   Environment 
The promotion and adoption of EEC measures and practices will enhance the achievement 
of  a  sustainable  environment  in  Cambodia.  As  part  of  the  EEC  targets,  the  national 
energy intensity will improve, which in turn will contribute towards improving the carbon 
emissions intensity.
4.4.4   EEC implementation structure
The third strategy is to establish a means of achieving EE. This can be achieved in many 
ways, but simple and more direct ways are recommended and summarised as follows:
(1) 
Engage  professional  bodies  and  stakeholders  to  incorporate  energy-efficient 
strategies  and  measures  in  preparing  building  codes  for  the  commercial  and 
residential sectors.
Engage  professional  bodies  and  stakeholders  to  prepare  EE  standards,  including 
minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) and guidelines for the residential, 
commercial, and industry sectors.
Involve professional bodies and stakeholders to establish the labelling of appliances 
for the residential sector.
Promote and generate an EE investment environment by 
a.  establishing  a  competent  energy  services  company  (ESCO)  business  to 
facilitate and expedite the achievement of energy savings for the commercial 
and industry sectors; 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) 
b.  establishing green building certification for the recognition of green practices, 
including EE; and
c.  providing  facilities  and  investment  tax  allowance  schemes  for  EE  projects 
deemed beneficial.
It is recommended that formulating the EEC plan should take into consideration 
the following:
i.  The plan should be cost-effective, such that the use of existing technologies 
 
and techniques to achieve EE would be sufficient.
ii.  The  plan  should  be  basic  and  simple 
in  order  to  facilitate  effective 
implementation.
iii.  Resources need to be allocated for the establishment of the EEC plan.
iv.  The proposed EEC plan should comprise short-, medium-, and long-term plans 
incorporating EE strategies and measures as described below.
82
Short-term strategies and measures, 2019–2021
(1) 
Identify and establish the responsible department or agency to take charge of the 
EEC plan.
• 
In  order  to  ensure  the  success  of  the  EEC  plan,  dedicated  and  committed 
resources need to be established. The responsible department or agency will be 
the custodian fully responsible for formulating and implementing the EEC plan.
(2) 
Formulate EEC structure and action plans.
•  The EEC plan should be structured for practical implementation with achievable 
targets.
(3) 
Engage with professional bodies and stakeholders to formulate the EEC plans.
•  Professional  bodies  and  stakeholders  should  be  invited  to  participate  in 
consultative forums in formulating the EEC plans.
(4)  Develop and implement EE promotional and awareness programmes.
•  Greater awareness of the benefits of EE will give a better chance of achieving 
success in the EEC plans.
(5)  Develop and conduct EE capacity-building programmes.
•  EE capacity-building programmes are important because the commercial and 
industry sectors need trained personnel to adopt EE practices in their respective 
workplaces.
(6)  Develop an EE syllabus for education.
• 
In  order  to  achieve  sustainability  in  EE,  the  younger  generations  need  to  be 
educated on EE culture and practices.
(7)  Develop EE guidelines and standards for the residential, commercial, and industry 
sectors.
•  EE guidelines and standards provide an important link and means of implementing 
and achieving EE.
•  EE guidelines and standards should incorporate passive and active EE measures.
(8)  Develop a labelling system for appliances.
•  EE labelling of appliances is useful for achieving energy savings in the residential 
sector.
•  Distributors and suppliers of appliances are recommended to be trained by the 
respective manufacturers on the significance of EE labelling and energy-saving 
potential  so  that  consumers  can  benefit  through  better  understanding  of  EE 
labelling. 
•  Distributors and suppliers of air conditioners are recommended to be trained 
by the respective manufacturers on the sizing and selection of air conditioners 
in  order  to  avoid  the  oversizing  of  air  conditioners  for  all  the  sectors,  but  in 
particular the residential sector, because house owners depend mostly on the 
83
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
suppliers’  and  installers’  recommendations.  Correct  sizing  and  selection  will 
help save capital costs and running costs.
(9)  Develop MEPS for equipment.
•  MEPS  specifying  minimum  energy  performance  requirements  are  useful  for 
achieving energy savings in the commercial and industry sectors.
(10)  Prepare building codes incorporating EE.
•  Buildings  codes  are  particularly  useful  for  achieving  energy  savings  in  the 
commercial and residential sectors. 
•  Building codes should incorporate passive and active EE measures.
(11)  Prepare efficient energy management regulations.
•  Efficient energy management regulations are mandatory requirements and are 
key to achieving success in EE in the industry and commercial sectors.
•  Premises that exceed a certain level of annual energy consumption would need 
to engage a qualified energy manager.
(12)  Initiate EE measures for government buildings.
•  The government can lead in the implementation of the EEC plan by adopting EE 
practices in government buildings. 
(13)  Establish ESCO support services.
•  Competent  energy  saving  and  management  services  provided  by  ESCOs  can 
help expedite achieving the results of energy-saving strategies and measures.
Medium-term strategies and measures, 2021–2025 
(1) 
Implement energy management systems for the industry and commercial sectors.
•  Energy  management  systems  provide  guidelines  for  systematic  energy 
management methods and best practices for industry and commercial sectors. 
(2) 
Establish EE financing infrastructure support and incentive schemes.
•  Financial institutions can help finance investment-scale EE projects.
•  The  government  may  consider  investment  tax  allowances  and  the  waiver  of 
duties for imports of EE equipment. 
(3) 
Establish EE recognition awards.
•  Awards recognising outstanding and successful EE projects in commercial and 
industry projects given by the government will help promote the adoption of EE. 
(4)  Continue capacity-building programmes.
•  Capacity-building programmes should be continuous, and a higher level of EE 
training is recommended.
84
Long-term strategies and measures, 2025–2030
(1)  Develop an EE legal framework.
• 
It is recommended that ultimately, a legal framework, such as the establishment 
of an EEC Act, is developed.
(2)  Develop  an  energy  efficiency  indicator  (EEI)  system  for  the  establishment  of 
benchmarking for the commercial and industry sectors.
•  An  EEI  system  based  on  the  IEA’s  EEI  methodology  (IEA,  2014)  should  be 
established.
(3) 
Incorporate EE into the education syllabus.
•  For a long-term and sustainable strategy, Cambodia’s education system should 
incorporate EEC concepts and practices into its syllabus.

4.5     Recommendations
o  Strong  EE  policies  are  vital  for  achieving  the  key  energy-policy  goals  of  reducing 
energy  bills,  addressing  climate  change,  improving  energy  security,  and  increasing 
energy  access.  The  economic  benefits  for  the  implementation  of  an  EEC  plan  have 
been  highlighted,  and  the  implementation  of  an  EEC  plan  is  highly  recommended, 
which  is  in  line  with  most  other  ASEAN  countries’  aspirations  and  also  the  IEA’s 
recommendations. 
o  The  recommended  strategic  framework  for  formulating  and  implementing  an  EEC 
plan  is  based  on  four  simple,  cost-effective,  and  practical  core  strategy  areas: 
energy  economics,  a  social  and  legal  framework,  the  environment,  and  an  EEC 
implementation  structure.  The  economic  component  of  the  EEC  strategies  would 
result in promoting the growth of EEC technology, equipment, and materials supply. 
In addition, Cambodia will benefit from skilled manpower capacity building as a result 
of the EEC plan implementation, which will generate demand for upgraded levels of 
skilled employment.
o  Based  on  the  outlook  for  energy  demand,  it  makes  economic  sense  for  Cambodia 
to embark on an EEC plan. Energy consumption can be reduced in future demand if 
Cambodia embarks on an EEC plan now.
o  Short-, medium-, and long-term EEC strategies and measures are recommended for 
implementation in stages, which can be adjusted to suit needs and resource allocations. 
The  EEC  plan  should  be  simple,  practical,  and  cost-effective,  and  it  should  also  be 
formulated based on a top-down approach, both from the government’s perspective 
and  the  private  sector’s  perspective.  In  summary,  this  recommended  EEC  plan  has 
identified the needs, means, and action plans to achieve EE and energy savings besides 
the economic benefits for Cambodia.

ENERGY
SECURITY
5.1     Current situation of energy security in Cambodia
A  sustained  population  and  economic  growth  in  Cambodia  are  the  key  drivers  in 
significantly  increasing  energy  demand  to  more  than  double  for  both  primary  and  final 
energy demand during 2015–2040. In absolute terms, Cambodia’s primary energy supply 
is projected to increase from 7.02 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) to 15.24 Mtoe 
during the period, while final energy demand is also expected to rise from 5.93 Mtoe to 
11.77 Mtoe (Kimura and Han, 2019). The strongest growth in final energy consumption 
is likely to occur in the transportation and industry sectors, with average growth rates of 
3.9% and 3.5%, respectively. Cambodia’s electricity demand is projected to have strong 
growth, with an average annual growth rate of 9% between 2015 and 2040. The fastest 
growth in electricity generation will be in hydropower (9.1% per year), followed by coal 
(7.5% per year). Generation from oil-fired power plants will decrease considerably due to 
high fuel costs. In the past, until 2001, almost 100% of electricity generation came from 
oil-fired power plants. In 2002, a hydropower plant started operation in Cambodia, and by 
2013, its share in the power generation mix had increased to 57.4%. Coal power generation 
was also introduced to Cambodia rather late, in 2009. By 2015, the share of coal in the 
power generation mix had risen to 48.4%, the highest share in the power generation mix.
Cambodia  has  a  very  high  import  dependency  as  the  country  relies  heavily  on  imports 
of  coal,  oil  (petroleum  products),  and  electricity.  To  fuel  economic  growth,  Cambodia 
continues to increase imports of these fossil fuels, which puts pressure on energy security. 
Cambodia’s import dependency increased from 50% to almost 60% during 2013–2016. 
The increase in energy demand in Cambodia will also see an increase in carbon dioxide 
(CO2) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. It is projected that CO2 emissions 
will increase by 5.6% per year from 1.96 million tonnes of carbon in 2015 to 8.62 million 
88
tonnes  of  carbon  in  2040  under  the  business-as-usual  scenario.  Oil  and  coal  are  the 
largest sources of carbon emissions.
The  increasing  energy  demand  in  Cambodia  poses  a  threat  to  supply  security.  Yet, 
oil  stockpiling  and  other  security  measures  are  yet  to  be  developed  to  cope  with  an 
unexpected supply disruption as they may arise from external factors, such as conflict in 
the Middle East, natural disasters, accidents, or terror attacks on oil supply cargo. Almost 
80%  of  oil  exports  from  the  Middle  East  are  bound  for  Asia.  So  far,  piracy  and  armed 
robbery  have  played  a  role  in  disrupting  the  free  movement  of  vessels,  causing  delays, 
financial losses, and even loss of life. Data from the International Maritime Bureau of the 
International Chamber of Commerce reveals that globally, acts of piracy and robbery at 
sea have declined over the past 5 years. However, piracy incidents in Southeast Asia and 
South Asia are either rising or continuing unabated, which could pose threats at any time 
to the supply security in the region, including Cambodia. 
Besides the oil supply security risks, Cambodia is affected by tropical weather, with plentiful 
rainfall that results in floods almost every year. Flooding is the major natural disaster in 
Cambodia, especially in the lower Tonlé Sap basin and the lower Mekong River provinces. 
The significant probability of flooding, combined with the relatively underdeveloped state 
of the road system in the country, results in the risk of oil supply disruption, especially 
the supply transported by lorry. This was evident when Typhoon Ketsana hit the country 
in 2009. Extreme weather, as Cambodia has become increasingly vulnerable to climate 
change, typhoons, and flooding, could possibly damage not only roads but (in an extreme 
case/scenario) could possibly damage the Sihanoukville port and railways, which could 
prevent oil transportation to major parts of Cambodia. In such an extreme but plausible 
case, it may take at least 1 month before oil transportation could be resumed normally 
as Cambodia does not have any strategic oil stockpiling to address the supply shortage 
during an oil supply disruption. Oil supply in Cambodia has been undertaken by private 
companies such as Chevron, Total, and PTT, as well as Cambodian suppliers like Sokimex 
and  Tela.  Based  on  government  regulations,  these  companies  are  supposed  to  hold 
inventory of (operational) oil stock at the terminals for about 30 days. However, these oil 
importing companies, in reality, may hold operational oil stock of only about 15–20 days 
as the country does not have a mechanism in place to monitor the petroleum product 
stock holdings of these companies. The government’s imposition on companies to hold 
inventory  oil  stock  of  about  30  days  will  require  these  companies  to  invest  more  in  oil 
facilities,  to  which  oil-importing  companies  may  not  comply  with  without  government 
inspection and monitoring systems in place.
Notably, the government is aware of these energy security issues, especially for oil supply 
security. The government has been working on improving road conditions and developing 
89
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
other  forms  of  transport  such  as  railways  and  barges  to  diversify  the  modes  of  oil 
transportation. The government’s efforts for the improvement of the disaster forecasting 
system, as well as emergency schemes for distributing fuel by various transport modes, 
are seen as a move in the right direction to reinforce oil supply resilience in the country. 
The current development of the oil refinery in Sihanoukville by Cambodian Petrochemical 
Company,  with  outsourcing  of  the  construction  contract  to  the  state-owned  Chinese 
National Petroleum Company, is to be completed by 2019, and the expected domestic 
oil production developed by KrisEnergy Ltd, the operator of Cambodian’s offshore Block 
A in the Gulf of Thailand, will likely increase Cambodian energy security in the near future.
The government is making efforts to develop energy infrastructures, such as oil refineries, 
and tap domestic oil production by 2020, but Cambodia may still face many challenges 
regarding how to manage resources effectively, which could threaten energy security, as 
well as the need to have adequate energy policy in both downstream petroleum products 
regulation and upstream resource extraction. While Cambodia is expecting indigenous oil 
production with the completion of its oil refinery by the end of 2019, the current energy 
security of Cambodia remains weak, with rising oil imports to meet the growing energy 
demand in the country. The energy security situation is worsening from the viewpoint of 
the lack of fuel diversification in the energy mix. For power generation, Cambodia mainly 
relies on hydropower and coal-fired power generation for its cities and provinces that are 
connected to the national grid. However, the electrification rate remains a critical issue for 
Cambodia, as about 40% of the population does not have access to electricity. Biomass 
remains a dominant source of energy for cooking in most rural parts of Cambodia. Thus, 
all these daunting issues of inaccessibility to commercial energy use contribute to energy 
insecurity.  In  addition,  Cambodia  has  its  Law  on  Disaster  Management  for  Flood  and 
Drought  but  not  a  law  for  an  energy  emergency  response  during  the  disruption  of  the 
energy supply. Given the background of the energy landscape of Cambodia, it is crucial 
for the government and specialised agencies to set energy security policies and provide 
suggested policy recommendations to overcome the energy security challenges.
5.2     Current policies related to energy security
The Government of Cambodia defined its energy sector development policy in October 
1994.  Later  on,  this  evolved  to  become  the  Power  Sector  Strategy  1999–2016,  with 
objectives to (1) provide an adequate supply of energy throughout Cambodia at reasonable 
and  affordable  prices,  (2)  ensure  a  reliable  and  secure  electricity  supply  at  prices  that 
allow sufficient investment in Cambodia and the development of the national economy, 
(3) encourage the exploration and environmentally and socially acceptable development 
of  the  energy  resources  needed  to  supply  all  sectors  of  the  Cambodian  economy,  (4) 
90
encourage  the  efficient  use  of  energy  and  minimise  the  detrimental  environmental 
effects resulting from energy supply and use. This strategy guided the development and 
policy framework of all energy sectors in Cambodia, including the Rural Electrification by 
Renewable Energy Policy, Renewable Electricity Action Plan 2002–2012, and the energy 
efficiency and conservation (EEC) goals.
In early 2001, the Electricity Law was passed with the aims of (1) ensuring the protection 
of  the  rights  of  consumers  to  receive  reliable  and  adequate  supply  of  electric  power 
services at reasonable costs; (2) promoting private ownership of the facilities for providing 
electric power services; (3) establishing competition wherever feasible in the sector; (4) 
establishing the Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC) for regulating electricity power 
services,  granting  the  right  and  obligation  to  penalise,  if  necessary,  the  suppliers  and 
consumers of electricity in relation to electricity generation and supply facilities; and (5) 
creating favourable conditions for investment in, and the commercial operation of, the 
electric power industry.
The EAC is an autonomous body set up to regulate and monitor the electric power sector 
throughout  the  country.  Its  duties  include  issuing  licenses,  approving  and  enforcing 
performance  standards  for  licensees  to  ensure  quality  supply  and  better  services  to 
consumers, and the determination of tariff, rates, and charges for electric power services 
that are fair to both consumers and licensees.
The law also sought to promote private investment and the ownership of power facilities 
and  to  encourage  competition  in  the  sector.  The  Electricity  Law  established  the  EAC 
as a legal public entity with the power to act as the regulator for power sector business 
activities. It also defined the roles of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), formerly 
known  as  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy.  The  MME  is  responsible  for  the 
overall administration of the energy sector. It is responsible for developing policies and 
strategies,  power  development  plans,  electricity  trade  with  neighbouring  countries, 
major investment projects, and the management of the rural electrification sector. Along 
with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the MME is the joint owner of Electricité du 
Cambodge (EDC). 
EDC was established in 1996 and became a state-owned company with the responsibility 
to generate, transmit, and distribute electricity throughout Cambodia. Its main functions 
are supplying electricity, developing the transmission grid, and facilitating the import and 
export of electricity to and from neighbouring countries. Independent power providers 
are private companies that have received a license from the EAC to generate electricity for 
public consumption. They generate electricity and sell it on to EDC, which then distributes 
it through the national grid.
91
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
In 2006, the government approved the Rural Electrification by Renewable Energy Policy. 
Its main objective is to create an enabling framework for renewable energy technologies 
to increase access to electricity in rural areas. The policy acknowledges the Master Plan 
Study on Rural Electrification by Renewable Energy in the Kingdom of Cambodia as the 
guiding document for the implementation of projects and programmes. The Master Plan 
envisions  the  following:  (1)  to  achieve  a  100%  level  of  village  electrification,  including 
battery lighting, by 2020; and (2) to achieve a 70% level of household electrification with 
grid-quality  electricity  by  2030.  In  addition,  Cambodia  aims  for  15%  of  rural  electricity 
supply from solar and small hydro by 2015. The Master Plan also lays out clear targets, 
investments, and responsibilities. About 1.83 million households are to be connected to 
the national grid by 2020. An additional 260,000 households in very remote areas – too 
far from the planned grid extension – will be supplied through isolated mini-grids using 
diesel-generated power and/or renewable energy (220,000 households) and solar home 
systems (40,000 households). The total cost for expanding the rural grid is estimated at 
US$1.37 billion. In the plan, EDC will be responsible for the overall planning, development, 
investment, and operation of the rural medium-voltage (22 kV) sub-transmission lines; 
and it will partner with private rural energy enterprises to expand, operate, and maintain 
low-voltage distribution and service lines (<0.4 kV). 
The  EEC  goals  submitted  to  the  5th  East  Asia  Summit  Energy  Ministers  Meeting,  held 
on  20  September  2011  in  Brunei  Darussalam,  state  that  the  country  uses  final  energy 
demand  as  the  energy  efficiency  (EE)  indicator  and  aims  at  a  10%  reduction  from  the 
business-as-usual scenario by 2030. The action plans to achieve the EEC goals cover the 
use of energy by the industry, transport, commercial, and residential sectors, such as the 
introduction of energy efficient equipment and EE labelling as well as the promotion of EE 
awareness amongst the public. 
5.3     Setting up energy security policy
Securing  the  energy  supply  with  affordable  prices  and  environmentally  sustainable 
energy uses is the main objective of Cambodia’s overall vision for energy policy. However, 
Cambodia has experienced rapid growth of energy demand, higher oil import dependence, 
a growing share of coal use for meeting electricity demand, and, thus, greater challenges 
to  energy  security  and  CO2  emissions  towards  2040.  These  could  threaten  the  stable 
supply of energy with affordable prices at the national and local levels. 
Thus,  Cambodia  needs  to  be  well-prepared  for  possible  oil  supply  disruptions  and 
enhance EE, reduce oil demand, particularly in the transport sector; engage in the clean 
92
use of fossil fuels; and promote energy diversification to such sources as natural gas and 
renewable energy.
 
Any  measures  to  strengthen  Cambodia’s  energy  security  could  be  more  efficiently  and 
effectively  pursued  by  regional  collaboration  (any  mechanism  of  bilateral  and  regional 
energy cooperation), which includes coordinated emergency response measures, cross-
country  energy  interconnections  (Mekong  subregion  power  connectivity),  and  the 
harmonisation  of  energy-related  standards  and  the  regulatory  environment  for  energy 
industries. Pursuing energy security policies also requires capacity building and enhanced 
awareness by the general public. Specific actions towards addressing energy security for 
policy, institution, and energy infrastructure investment are vital for addressing the key 
salient policies for energy security in Cambodia.
5.4     Policy recommendations 
•  As  Cambodia  is  expected  to  have  stable  economic  growth  in  the  medium-to-long 
term, in which the industry sector will play a major role in contributing significantly to 
GDP, the country will need a stable, reliable, and affordable energy price to ensure that 
Cambodia is competitive in the global market. In this regard, the country may need to 
establish  an  institution,  such  as  a  national  emergency  strategy  organisation,  to  deal 
with energy supply disruption in the future.
•  The  Cambodian  government  may  consider  establishing  hard  infrastructure,  such  as 
oil  stockpiling  by  the  government,  on  top  of  what  oil  importing  companies  hold  in 
inventory oil stock of 30 days of net imports. Having oil stock is significant for ensuring 
that important industries and sectors, such as the healthcare, food, and electronics 
industries,  are  well  protected  during  an  emergency  response  to  an  energy  supply 
disruption. 
  However, having a stock of oil is a good signal to investors, and it could attract more 
important investment to Cambodia, such as in electronics and other sectors, as these 
will require a stable energy supply without blackouts, and energy input is key to overall 
production  costs  to  ensure  Cambodia’s  industries  remain  competitive  for  products 
produced outside of Cambodia. The government should note that having an oil stock 
is good for energy security, but the effects could also increase the price of petroleum 
products,  which  could  affect  industry  and  other  sector  competitiveness  as  these 
sectors may use petroleum products as inputs of production. 
93
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
•  Policymakers  may  need  to  develop  energy  policies  to  shelter  the  country  from 
potential  risks  by  bringing  energy  resiliency  through  appropriate  energy  policy  and 
energy infrastructure investment, such as for oil-receiving terminals, ports, pipelines, 
and strong electricity grids. 
•  As Cambodia only has an operational oil stock of 30 days, other response measures 
during an oil disruption may be need to be considered, such as (i) demand restraint 
measures,  which  can  range  from  being  light-handed  (e.g.,  public  information 
campaigns  to  promote  voluntary  actions)  to  more  medium-  and  heavy-handed 
measures (e.g., driving restrictions or fuel rationing). These measures can be applied 
differently across various sectors, but road transportation is commonly targeted due 
to the high proportion of oil consumption it represents; (ii) fuel-switching measures, 
which comprise the substitution of one form of fuel for another (e.g., natural gas is a 
possible alternative to oil in the event of an oil disruption, particularly in those power 
generators  capable  of  operation  using  either  fuel;  (iii)  surge  production  measures, 
comprising the rapid activation (within 30 days) of spare crude oil production capacity 
to increase oil supply; and (iv) fuel specification measures, such as environmental or 
quality standards, which can be temporarily relaxed by governments to increase the 
flexibility of supply. 
• 
In addition, Cambodia could see huge energy savings in the transformation sector if 
policies are formulated to ensure that new fleets of power generation be deployed for 
high efficiency and low-emission power generation. Currently, coal-fired power plants 
are  deployed  in  Sihanoukville  based  on  sub-critical  technology  as  these  plants  are 
installed with a small capacity (50–100 MW) in which high-efficient technology such 
as Ultra Super Technology cannot be used unless the installed capacity is at least 400–
500  MW.  In  addition,  low  technology,  such  as  sub-critical  technology,  is  relatively 
cheaper  in  terms  of  capital  cost,  and,  thus,  Cambodia  may  opt  for  low  technology. 
However, this low technology is associated with low efficiency, high CO2 emissions, 
and  other  pollutants,  such  as  sulphur  dioxide,  nitrogen  dioxide,  and  particulate 
matters, which could threaten the health of residents living near the plants, and acid 
rain could be a serious problem in the future.
•  Collective measures and actions to rapidly develop and deploy EE and savings in all 
sectors and double the share of renewable energy, such as off solar, wind, and biomass 
power generation, in the overall energy mix for inclusive and sustainable development 
are highly recommended as a holistic approach.
94
•  Finally,  electrifying  Cambodia  to  the  100%  electrification  rate  is  a  must  and  urgent 
as  many  households  still  cannot  access  commercial  energy.  Thus,  appropriate 
energy policies to promote distributed energy systems, either using fossil fuel power 
generation or renewable energy, are highly recommended to ensure that remote and 
mountainous areas are able to access electricity as this energy is important for their day-
to-day needs. The lack of this energy will affect their health, the capital formulation of 
children, and other businesses-related opportunities.

CHAPTER 6
ENERGY
OUTLOOK
6.1.     Future trend analysis by 2030
The  Basic  Energy  Plan  (BEP)  outlook  considers  not  only  the  business-as-usual  (BAU) 
scenario but also the alternative policy scenario (APS), consisting of the energy efficiency 
and conservation (EEC) scenario (APS1) and the development of more renewable energy 
(APS2).  These  two  scenarios  were  based  on  the  policy  intervention  assumed  for  the 
BEP. Under APS1, the assumption is to reduce total final energy consumption (TFEC) 
in all sectors by 10% by the year 2030 relative to the BAU. Under APS2, the BEP sets the 
generation share from fossil-fuelled plants to be 35% in 2030, while hydro is 55% and other 
renewable is 10%. The APS will be the combination of APS1 and APS2.
6.1.1.  Total primary energy supply by energy
Under the BAU, Cambodia’s total primary energy supply (TPES) is projected to increase to 
almost 13 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2030 at an average rate of almost 4% 
per year (Figure 6.1). Fossil fuels will still dominate Cambodia’s future TPES with a share 
increasing to 60% in 2030. The increasing share of fossil fuels in the TPES is due to the 
rapid increase of coal consumption in the country, particularly for power generation. Oil 
consumption will also continue to increase in the future due to the growth in the number 
of cars and motorbikes. The rate of increase, however, will be slower than it was during 
2010–2016. Consequently, the share of oil in the TPES will decline to 30% in 2030. 
96
Under the APS, the TPES will grow more slowly at around 3% per year, increasing to 10.5 
Mtoe in 2030. The share of non-fossil fuels will be dominant in the APS (52% in 2030), 
while the fossil fuel share will fall to 48% in 2030. Non-fossil fuels are dominant in the 
TPES of the APS compared to the BAU because of the BEP assumption in APS2. The 
BEP sets the shares of hydro and renewable in total power generation at 55% and 10%, 
respectively. The remaining share of power generation in APS2 will come from coal (35%).

The coal supply in the TPES will be around 2.1 Mtoe (55.3%) lower than in the BAU in 
2030, while oil and ‘others’ will be lower by only 13.2% (0.5 Mtoe) and 3.8% (0.2 Mtoe), 
respectively. The reductions in oil and ‘others’ in the TPES of the APS are not as much as 
for coal because the majority of these resources are consumed by the final sectors, not 
the power sector. ‘Others’ covers biomass, solar, wind, and electricity net trade. Hydro in 
the APS will be 2.5 times higher than in the BAU (151.1% or 0.6 Mtoe). Overall, the total 
saving for the TPES between the BAU and the APS in 2030 will be around 2.2 Mtoe or 
17.4%
 
97
CAMBODIA BASIC ENERGY PLAN
6.1.2.  Total final energy consumption by energy and sector
Under the BAU, the TFEC in Cambodia is projected to increase at an average rate of 6.6% 
per year to around 9 Mtoe in 2030 (Figure 6.2). Amongst the other sectors, the strongest 
growth in the future will be in the ‘others’ sector, which consists mostly of the commercial 
and residential sectors, since the consumption of electricity in these sectors will increase 
rapidly in the future. The transport sector will still dominate Cambodia’s future TFEC and 
also grow rapidly but at a slower rate than the ‘others’ sector.
Under the APS, the TFEC will grow more slowly at 5.8% per year, increasing to 8.2 Mtoe 
in 2030. Similar to the BAU, the ‘others’ sector in the APS will have the fastest growth 
rate,  followed  by  the  transport  sector.  Final  energy  demand  savings  between  the  APS 
and the BAU in 2030 will amount to 0.9 Mtoe (Figure 6.2). The bulk of the savings are 
expected to occur in the ‘others’ sector (0.5 Mtoe), followed by the transport sector (0.3 
Mtoe) and the industry sector (0.1 Mtoe). Improvements in end-user technologies and 
the introduction of energy management systems are expected to contribute to the slower 
growth rate of consumption in all sectors.

By type of fuel, electricity consumption will grow the fastest, at 8.8% per year under the 
BAU and 8% per year under the APS. Although electricity will have the fastest growth, 
biomass will have the highest share in the TPES (41% in 2030) for both the BAU and the 
APS (Figure 6.3). Similarly, oil will have the same share in both the BAU and the APS at 
around 40% in 2030.

6.1.3.  Alternative policy scenario energy indicators
The gross domestic product (GDP) of Cambodia is assumed to grow at an average rate of 
6.6% per year until 2030, with a population growth of 1.6% per year. As shown in Figure 
6.4, GDP will almost double in the next decade (2020–2030), but the TPES will increase 
by only 1.3 times. The TPES energy intensity will decline, confirming that the BEP measure 
of a 10% reduction will be achieved by 2030.

6.1.4.  Energy security
As  coal  and  oil  will  still  play  a  major  role  in  the  future  energy  mix  of  Cambodia,  the 
country’s  dependence  on  these  fuels  from  international  market  will  still  be  significant. 
Import dependency will increase from 54% in 2020 to 62% in 2030 under the BAU (Figure 
6.5).  Under  the  APS,  because  of  the  BEPC,  import  dependency  will  decline  to  49%  in 
2030 from 52% in 2020.

6.2.    Monitoring of the Basic Energy Plan implementation
The  energy  outlook  under  the  BEP  for  Cambodia  provides  the  future  magnitudes  of 
energy demand and supply under both the BAU and APS conditions. The APS includes 
the energy saving target and renewable energy expansion plans proposed under the BEP. 
The energy outlook under the BEP for Cambodia provides only the projected magnitudes 
of the future TFEC and TPES of Cambodia. Implementation of the BEP can be monitored 
by collecting the actual TFEC and TPES magnitudes annually. In this regard, the Ministry 
of  Mines  and  Energy  of  Cambodia  (MME)  should  continuously  produce  the  country’s 
Energy Balance Table and compare it to the BEP outlook.
In addition to the monitoring of the TFEC and TPES, the MME should also monitor the 
other energy indicators (TPES/GDP, TFEC/GDP, TPES per capita, TFEC per capita, and 
import dependency). Assessment of these indicators will assist the MME in identifying 
and  understanding  the  key  drivers  of  trends  and  in  prioritising  policy  interventions  to 
control energy consumption growth. The indicators can also be effective for quantifying 
the potential impacts and benefits of policy interventions.
