 Chile’s Energy Challenge
The Foundations of a Developed Country 
Chilean economy in 2011 was 6.3%, with most sectors showing 
strong expansion. 
As our country grows, it needs more energy, so there is a natural 
linkage  between  the  economy  and  energy.  Therefore,  the 
challenge for Chile today is to have sufficient and competitive 
energy  resources  to  support  this  development.  Energy  is 
an  essential  material  for  society.  Its  availability  and  supply 
directly affect social and economic growth and consequently

must be clear that it can sustain it with clean, safe, economical 
energy. 
Transforming Chile into a developed country not only implies 
achieving  certain  macroeconomic  goals,  but  also  making  a 
significant step forward, both quantitatively and qualitatively 
in  education,  strengthening  healthcare  guarantees;  making 
decisive progress in the access to and quality of housing; and 
putting an end, once and for all, to extreme poverty so as to 
improve  the  circumstances  of  thousands  of  Chileans  who 
currently live in poverty. 
Our  development  requires  sustained  growth  by  the  Chilean 
economy. In effect, Chile grew at a rate of 5.4% between 1986 
and 2010 (7.4% between 1986 and 1998 and 3.3% between 
1999 and 2009). Since 2009 - particularly in 2010 and 2011 
-  our  country  has  recovered  its  ability  to  grow  quickly.  The 
productive sector has reacted vigorously and the economy has 
become  very  active  and  this  in  turn  has  resulted  in  positive

How much Energy do we Need and at what Cost?
Demand in a Developed Society 
Central, SIC), 25.6% from the Norte Grande Interconnected System (Sistema Interconectado del Norte Grande, SING) and 0.8% 
from the medium-sized systems in Aysén and Magallanes. 
The maximum demand during the year just gone was 6,881 MW from the SIC, and 2,162 MW from the SING. 
On analyzing gross generation during 2011, the SIC produced 46,095 GWh, which represents 6.8% growth compared to 2010, 
while the SING generated a gross total of 15,878 GWh, 5.2% more than the previous year. 
Between  now  and  2020,  growth  rates  of  around  6%  to  7%  are  projected  for  electricity  consumption  in  Chile,  which  means 
almost 100,000 GWh of total electricity demand by that year. That means that an increase in supply of some 8,000 MW of new 
generation projects would be needed to satisfy the demand. 
This is a mammoth undertaking, particularly considering that Chile is predominantly an importer of energy resources and that it 
has in recent years been particularly dependant on fossil fuels, the prices for which have increased the marginal costs of energy 
generation, leading to higher electricity prices.

The price of electricity, both in the spot market and for 
contracts for free and regulated clients, has also been 
impacted by the abrupt change in the conditions of gas 
supply from Argentina, as well as the increase in investment 
costs for conventional technologies. Electricity prices in Chile 
are in fact among the highest in Latin Amercia and higher 
than the OECD average. It can therefore be seen that Chile is 
very exposed with regard to energy and one of our challenges 
must be to have sufficient and competitive energy resources 
to sustain our growth.

Similarly, we aim for traditional hydroelectricity to achieve 
45% to 48% share of the matrix in the same period, with 
the remaining share coming from thermoelectric sources.
 
 Our Government has decided that it will not take any deci-
sion regarding the use of nuclear energy for generating 
electricity. However, we realize that it is responsible and 
necessary to continue the studies and technical exchanges 
with developed countries so that future Governments will 
be able to take decisions in this area with the participation 
and adequate knowledge of the public. 
In order to guide the electricity matrix of the SIC and SING 
in this way - without forgetting the particular aspects of 
our medium-sized systems in Aysén and Magallanes – and 
in the conviction that we must address the current weak-
nesses and fragilities, the National Energy Strategy is based 
on the following fundamental pillars. 
First, to make a real commitment to energy efficiency 
establishing it as a highly important public policy through 
which we will seek to reduce consumption and unlink 
growth and energy demand. 
Second, to ratify the need to increasingly incorporate non 
conventional renewable energy sources into the Chilean 
electricity matrix. 
Third, to clearly and decidedly strengthen traditional 
renewable energy sources. To this end, our country must 
make the most of its comparative advantages, reducing its 
external dependence and limiting the increase in green-
house gas emissions. 
Fourth, to strengthen the design and solidity and boost the 
development of our transmission system. 
Fifth, to address the different challenges presented by the 
market and electricity distribution. 
Six, to promote sustained progress with developing interna-
tional inter-connections.

The design of each of these pillars is inspired by fundamental principles, such as the long-term reliability of the system; 
access and equity for everyone in Chile; the vision of the regions; the promotion of a market with greater levels of com-
petition and lower prices; national energy security and independence; efficiency and social commitment; environmental 
protection; spaces for international integration and technological innovation, among others.  
This document introduces the key characteristics of each of the pillars and also includes some of the legal, regulatory and 
administrative measures and certain public-private initiatives which are necessary for its implementation.

the  construction  sector,  including  social  housing,  the  Plan 
aims to improve the energy values for buildings built without

standards  and  to  offer  construction  products  and  services 
with efficiency criteria, etc. 
For  the  industry  and  mining  sector,  the  Action  Plan  will 
encourage  the  adoption  of  energy  efficiency  measures 
through developing and implementing energy management 
systems,  promoting  cogeneration  and  the  incorporation  of 
efficient technology and technical assistance into projects. 
In the transport sector, data on energy use will be compiled 
and systematized, in order to encourage greater efficiency 
in passenger transport and freight. A vehicle labeling system 
and the setting of minimum energy efficiency standards for 
vehicles will also be put in place. 
The  demand  for  modern  appliances  with  low  energy 
consumption  will  be  promoted,  through  the  establishment 
of applicable minimum efficiency standards and incentives 
for replacing old appliances with more energy efficient ones.

Public  energy  efficiency  policies  cannot  be  conceived  in  isolation,  but  should  instead  be  established  across  sectors. 
Coordination between public organizations and ministries is key to achieving the estimated potential energy saving for each 
of the areas which consume it, such as the public, residential, commercial and transportation sectors. 
For this purpose, we will create an Interministerial Commission for the Development of Energy Efficiency Policies, through

Tender Mechanism to encourage the

In order to give further impetus to the development of NCRE, 
we will improve upon current legislation. 
Parallel to the scheme included in the laws in this area, and 
with the goal of attracting investors interested in developing 
NCRE projects, open tenders will be carried out by NCRE block, 
in which the generators who  participate  could be  awarded 
a  State  subsidy  to  improve  the  conditions  of  energy  sales. 
This  will  be  defined  according  to  the  bids  submitted.  This 
will decrease the risks to which such projects are currently 
exposed.  Through  this  measure,  we  will  support  those  new

strengthened and implemented to guide and facilitate private 
investment  in  NCRE  projects.  A  geo  referenced  platform 
will  be  created  that  will  compile  dynamic  information  so 
the  viability  of  an  NCRE  project  can  be  assessed.    This  will 
include a portfolio of NCRE projects; a database of potential 
resources  and  State  land  available  for  the  development 
of  such  projects;  detail  of  energy  demand  at  an  industrial, 
commercial and residential level; information on roads and 
electricity  infrastructure;  environmental  protection  areas 
and available information on land planning so as to identify 
the  availability  of  compatible  lands  with  other  productive 
uses.  This  platform  will  be  integrated  with  the  platforms 
of  other  State  organizations  that  have  the  authority  to 
manage  national  land,  such  as  that  of  the  National  Assets 
Ministry  and  those  available  on  the  SEIA.  The  goal  will  be 
to offer certainty regarding the feasibility of NCRE projects 
and  to  take  greater  advantage  of  public  lands  for  energy

Strategies for Technology 
There are different obstacles to the implementation of each type of NCRE technology, so a different long-term strategy 
is  needed  for  each  of  the  energy  sources:  solar,  wind,  bioenergy,  biomass,  geothermal,  mini-hydro  and  tidal.  Under  this 
strategy, we will work together with the public and private sectors, researchers and public representatives so as to develop 
measures to address the obstacles to each of these technologies, taking into account aspects such as research, development 
and innovation (R+D+i), resource exploration, development tools, funding and regulatory framework. 
From this perspective, and recognizing the great attraction of geothermal energy for our country due to its potential and 
high plant factor, we are preparing a new regulatory base to encourage investment based on this renewable resource. 
Furthermore,  a  new  subsidy  and  incentives  plan  will  be  implemented  for  pilot  NCRE  projects  to  further  develop  various 
technologies in a national context, thus attaining fundamental practical knowledge to recognize the technical and economic 
benefits of Chile taking advantage of its own renewable resources. It is hoped that the development of such pilot projects 
will  enable  the  experience  and  knowledge  of  international  companies  to  be  integrated  with  the  development  of  local 
technologies, driving innovation in Chile’s NCRE industry.

comply  with  the  respective  standards.  To  this  end,  we  will  work  together  with  the  Environment  Ministry  and  National

An important decision by this Government is to design mechanisms that will encourage the adoption of increasingly clean 
and efficient technologies. We will also study the possibility of incorporating tax instruments to dampen the disadvantages 
and promote the advantages and social benefits of projects, so as to reorientate our electricity matrix. 
We must also recognize the growing presence of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an alternative source of energy in the long-
term.  There  is  in  fact  significant  potential  for  further  developing  our  LNG  regasification  plants.  The  availability  of  this 
resource and its growing global share, together with new techniques and processes of exploration and production, show 
that LNG is an attractive alternative for the decades to come. Also in this field, new techniques and processes for exploration 
and production and non-conventional resources show new alternatives for the future. For this reason, we will also promote 
both traditional and innovative exploration processes in Chile.

A New Focus on Transmission
Towards a Public Electricity Highway
27
In  this  context  the  Government  considers  it  fundamental 
to  create  a  new,  more  secure  and  robust  scheme  for  the 
development  of  electricity  networks,  which  will  facilitate 
access  for  all  investors  in  generation  projects  and  foster 
initiatives using renewable energy sources. 
In  such  a  framework  the  State  will  play  a  key  role  in  the 
planning  of  transmission  systems,  the  dimensioning  of 
networks and definition of their territorial scope, the creation 
of  utility  corridors,  and  the  improvement  of  legislation 
governing concessions and easements. 
It  is  therefore  essential  to  improve  our  current  regulations

At  the  same  time,  small  generators,  and  in  particular 
renewable  resource  generators 
located  far  from  the 
main  transmission  lines,  as  well  as  others  who  wish  to  be 
connected  to  the  distribution  networks,  suffer  difficult  and

there is an ever-increasing need for their contribution to the 
electricity supply. 
This makes it essential for us to have a long-term vision which 
takes into account all the electricity networks needed by the 
country  over  its  whole  length  and  breadth,  with  sufficient 
security margins to guarantee the various projects and which

will allow NCRE generation sources to be connected.

Improving Procedures for Granting 
Electricity Concessions  
In  order  to  make  the  electricity  concession  process  more 
fluid and suited to the challenges of generation and system 
demand, we will present to National Congress observations on 
the bill on this subject which is presently before Congress, with 
the object of making the procedure for obtaining electricity 
concessions  quicker  and  more  precise,  while  safeguarding 
the legitimate rights of third parties.  Likewise, modifications 
will be made in parallel to the current regulations in all areas 
which do not fall into the legal domain. 
Creation of Utility Corridors 
The  State  would  be  able  to  declare  Utility  Corridors,  which 
may be expropriated or the object of easements in the public 
or national interest, based on information provided by studies 
and interministerial coordination. 
To implement this concept, the current electricity regulations 
will  be  modified,  creating  a  specific  regulation  for  facilities 
listed  as  being  of  public  or  national  interest,  which  would 
make use of these corridors. Some of the aspects to be dealt 
with  by  the  new  regulations  would  be:  the  remuneration 
regime  for  these  facilities,  their  dimensions,  and  territorial 
planning  for  expansion  of  the  transmission  system  through 
their development.

Regulatory Changes in Additional and Trunk Transmission and in Sub-transmission 
These regulatory changes are important for imparting consistency to the regulatory framework governing transmission systems, 
under the new focus of a public electricity highway. Furthermore they are necessary for the connection of generation projects to 
the electricity system, and therefore for our target of ensuring competitive generation prices by eliminating barriers. They are 
also necessary to provide a regulatory framework for the new focus on a public electricity highway for transmission installations. 
In trunk transmission, regulatory change goes hand-in-hand with the new concept of a public electricity highway, which will 
require a review of the systems for assigning payment to installations, and of the objectives and structure of trunk transmission 
studies. 
In the area of additional transmission, definitions will be made for aspects such as the conditions for open access by third parties to 
transmission lines under this classification, the minimum asset valuation conditions for such open access, and the corresponding 
payment scheme. 
Finally, in sub-transmission, work will be done on improving the mechanisms for connection to these networks, and their long 
term security and development. 
Facilitating Connection for Small Generators and Intelligent Networks 
We will improve the existing regulation governing the connection of small generators, in order to facilitate the connection of 
these projects. The transparency mechanisms governing the information provided by distribution companies, and the costs 
associated with such information, will be improved, incorporating processes which will give greater participation and oversight 
to the Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels (Superintendencia de Electricidad y Combustibles, SEC). Information guidelines 
will  be  created  for  investors  interested  in  becoming  involved  at  the  distribution  level.  The  procedures  for  determining  the 
costs and benefits for the distribution network resulting from the connection of a small generator will be modified. 
Progress  will  be  made  in  implementing  the  concept  of  intelligent  networks  as  broadly  as  possible,  in  order  to  help  the 
introduction of distributed generation, among other things. To this end the technical and economic viability of the concept 
will be analyzed, taking into account developments, implementations and local and international experience of pilot projects, 
and trying above all to evaluate the advantages of implementing this new technology (offering both a social and a private 
benefit) in the Chilean market.

Towards a More Competitive  
Electricity Market 
31
Chile was a world pioneer in liberalizing its electricity market, being the first country in the world to privatize the electricity 
sector.  This  has  enabled  the  country  to  increase  the  installed  capacity  of  the  SIC  by  four  times,  and  that  of  the  SING  by 
six times, in the last twenty years. This has created a market which has been able to meet the maximum demands on the 
electricity system, although it is not free of difficulties, as already indicated in this document. 
However, as we have mentioned, a series of weaknesses may be observed which need to be addressed now in order to ensure 
an  electricity  market  with  greater  levels  of  competition,  security  and  reliability.  Throughout  this  document,  a  series  of 
measures is described whose overarching object, apart from meeting the specific proposals of their general framework, is the 
desire to introduce more competition into the sector in the medium- and long-term. It is our conviction that the regulatory 
framework should encourage and facilitate the entry of new actors into the system, with the resulting diversification of the 
participants, thereby progressing towards a more competitive and efficient electricity market, in which the market operator 
can  take  independent  decisions  in  matters  affecting  both  supply  security  and  the  levels  of  competition  and  transparency 
prevailing in the electricity market. 
At the same time it is essential to improve the tender mechanisms for regulated clients, since on the one hand the existing 
mechanism  does  not  efficiently  provide  long-term  signals  to  the  end  client,  and  on  the  other,  contrary  to  expectations, 
this mechanism has not led to large numbers of new actors entering the market. The existence of contracts with electricity 
distributors affected by generator breakdown, and the impact of this on the market, ratifies the need for a change of course 
in this respect. 
It is therefore natural to adapt the electricity tariff terms for end consumers, in a scenario in which technology has evolved 
sufficiently to allow clients the flexibility of choosing between several economic and technical alternatives for meeting their 
electricity needs. 
32
123RF
Creation of Independent Operation Centers  
The  Chilean  electricity  market  requires  an  organization  with  the  quality,  independence  and  strength  necessary  for  the 
physical and economic operation of the electricity system. Likewise the need for transparent information and effective market 
supervision will provide the necessary foundations for institutional reform of the organization responsible for the security and 
economic operation of the electricity system, and access to it. 
Independent  Operation  Centers  will  be  created  for  each  electricity  system,  replacing  the  Economic  Load  Dispatch  Centers 
(CDEC).  They  will  be  legal  entities  with  their  own  assets,  an  autonomous  management  structure  and  clearly  defined 
responsibilities. The objective will be to guarantee the independence and proper functioning of electricty market operators, 
such  that  operational  decisions  on  electricity  installations,  and  decisions  leading  to  economic  transfers  between  market 
operators, are timely and transparent for all parties operating in the market. 
These new institutions will also have a clear role in the planning of transmission systems, contributing to the development of 
electricity transmission infrastructure, and to the security and sufficiency of the system in the long term. 
33
Secure, Economical Electricity for the Distribution Network 
The  regulation  of  supply  tenders  will  be  improved,  with  the  objective  of  generating  the  most  effective  mechanisms  for 
awarding energy blocks at prices which reflect long-term conditions, damping uncertainty in supply and demand and reducing 
the negative effects of speculative actions. 
In addition, the minimum notice periods for calls to tender will be modified and tender schemes will be designed with shorter 
contract periods. The standardization of the resulting contracts will also be studied. 
Furthermore, specific measures will be established to introduce greater competition at the level of tariffs to final customers, 
through the design of effective mechanisms for tariff flexibility to regulated clients, allowing these to manage and optimize 
their electricity consumption. In the same context, one of the measures proposed is to lower the limit defining the classification 
of free clients from 500 kW to 100 kW. 
Likewise the feasibility will be assessed of implementing free choice of electricity supplier through the introduction of the 
“sales  agent”,  establishing  the  necessary  guarantee  and  verification  schemes  to  ensure  that  the  contracts  signed  are  duly 
backed by production. All these changes will be implemented gradually in the retail market. In this respect, existing regulations 
will be reviewed to evaluate the separation of network activity from commercial activity in the distribution segment. 
At the same time, distribution tariff calculation processes will be reviewed in order to implement any modifications needed to 
reflect business risks properly and improve tariff calculation procedures. 
Net Metering for Residential Generators 
In order to consolidate the distribution of energy generated 
as  an  effective  solution  tending  towards  a  more  efficient 
electricity  system  with 
increased  supply,  a  regulatory 
design  incorporating  Net  Metering  will  be  implemented 
after approval by Congress. The object of this initiative is to 
allow  end  users  (e.g.  families  or  small  businesses)  to  install 
technologies for generating electricity from non conventional 
renewable energy sources in their homes or businesses. The 
energy generated by each of these small producers may be 
used for own consumption or for injection into the network, 
to the point where they may even receive a net payment from 
the distributor for the electricity they deliver.
