Changes from last edition 
Geographical coverage 
Lithuania  joined  the  IEA  in  February  2022;  however,  its  data  have  not  been 
included in the IEA member countries aggregate (IEA total) for this edition. They 
are  included  in  the  IEA  and  Accession/Association  countries  aggregate  (IEA 
family) for data starting in 1990 and for the entire time series. 
The  IEA  continues  to  expand  the  coverage  of  its  statistics  reports  and 
encourages  more  countries  to  collaborate  on  data  exchange.  As  detailed  data 
have  become  consistently  available  for  the  Kingdom  of  Eswatini,  Madagascar, 
Rwanda and Uganda, the associated time series are now shown explicitly in the 
main list of countries and have been removed from the Other Africa region. 
For further details, please refer to the section on Geographical coverage.

Time 
In a continuous effort to provide users with more timely data, the 2022 edition of 
IEA’s World Energy Balances has been expanded to increase data coverage for 
the most recent (2021) year:  
  Full 2021 energy statistics tables and balances are available for 2 non-OECD 
countries: Argentina and Brazil. 
  Coverage of total electricity generation by product has been extended, now 
including 32 non-OECD countries and additional regional aggregates such as 
the European Union.  
  Coverage of imports and exports of crude oil is complete for People’s Republic 
of China; India; Indonesia; Thailand; Trinidad and Tobago; and Uruguay; with 
data for imports and exports of all primary and secondary oil products available 
for another 19 non-OECD countries and some regional aggregates, such as 
European Union and G8. 
  The Indicators database now includes 2021 GDP and GDPPPP data for most 
countries. Energy indicators have been calculated for 2021 where possible.  
Revisions of GDP time series  
The sources of GDP data used to derived selected energy indicators have been 
changed from previous editions to move to a homogenous source across OECD 
and non-OECD countries. The current sources are: 
International  Monetary  Fund.  2021.  World  Economic  Outlook:  War  Sets 
Back the Global Recovery. Washington, DC, October. (IMF WEO) 
World Development Indicators. 2022. Washington, D.C. :The World Bank. 
(WB WDI) 
CEPII – CHELEM database. 2022. (CHELEM) 
This  change  has  impact  on  the  indicators  derived  from  GDP  (e.g.  total  energy 
supply/GDP),  with  variable 
levels  depending  on 
the  country.  For  more 
information on sources, please refer to Flow definitions.

Flow definitions 
Supply 
Flow 
Short name 
Definition 
Comprises the production of primary energy, i.e. hard coal, lignite, peat, 
crude oil, NGLs, natural gas, biofuels and waste, nuclear, hydro, 
geothermal, solar and the heat from heat pumps that is extracted from the 
ambient environment (only heat generated from heat pumps that is sold to 
third parties is included in the energy balance). Production is calculated after 
removal of impurities (e.g. sulphur from natural gas). Calculation of 
production of hydro, geothermal, etc. and nuclear electricity is explained 
in section Units and conversions. 
Production 
INDPROD 
Comprise amounts having crossed the national territorial boundaries of the 
country whether or not customs clearance has taken place. 
For coal: Imports comprise the amount of fuels obtained from other 
countries, whether or not there is an economic or customs union between 
the relevant countries. Coal in transit should not be included. 
For oil and natural gas: Quantities of crude oil and oil products imported under 
processing agreements (i.e. refining on account) are included. Quantities of oil 
in transit are excluded. Crude oil, NGL and natural gas are reported as coming 
from the country of origin; refinery feedstocks and oil products are reported 
as coming from the country of last consignment. Imported LNG which is 
exported to another country after regasification is considered both as an 
import and as an export of gas. 
For electricity: Amounts are considered as imported when they have crossed the 
national territorial boundaries of the country. If electricity is “wheeled” or transited 
through a country, the amount is shown as both an import and an export. 
Imports 
IMPORTS 
Comprise amounts having crossed the national territorial boundaries of the 
country whether or not customs clearance has taken place. 
For coal: Exports comprise the amount of fuels supplied to other countries, 
whether or not there is an economic or customs union between the relevant 
countries. Coal in transit should not be included. 
For oil and natural gas: Quantities of crude oil and oil products exported under 
processing agreements (i.e. refining on account) are included. Re-exports of 
oil imported for processing within bonded areas are shown as an export of 
product from the processing country to the final destination. Imported LNG 
which is exported to another country after regasification is considered both 
as an import and as an export of gas. 
For electricity: Amounts are considered as exported when they have crossed the 
national territorial boundaries of the country. If electricity is “wheeled” or transited 
through a country, the amount is shown as both an import and an export. 
Exports 
EXPORTS 
Covers those quantities delivered to ships of all flags that are engaged in 
international navigation. The international navigation may take place at sea, on 
inland lakes and waterways, and in coastal waters. Consumption by ships 
engaged in domestic navigation is excluded. The domestic/international split is 
determined on the basis of port of departure and port of arrival, and not by the 
flag or nationality of the ship. Consumption by fishing vessels and by military 
forces is also excluded. See domestic navigation, fishing and non-specified 
(other). 
International marine bunkers are excluded from the supply at the country 
and regional level, but not for world, where they are included in transport

under World marine bunkers. 
Includes deliveries of aviation fuels to aircraft for international aviation. Fuels 
used by airlines for their road vehicles are excluded. The 
domestic/international split should be determined on the basis of departure 
and landing locations and not by the nationality of the airline. For many 
countries this incorrectly excludes fuel used by domestically owned carriers 
for their international departures. 
International aviation bunkers are excluded from the supply at the country 
and regional level, but not for world, where they are included in transport 
under World aviation bunkers. 
International 
aviation 
bunkers 
AVBUNK 
Reflects the difference between opening stock levels on the first day of the 
year and closing levels on the last day of the year of stocks on national 
territory held by producers, importers, energy transformation industries and 
large consumers. A stock build is shown as a negative number, and a stock 
draw as a positive number. 
Stock 
changes 
STOCKCHA 
Total energy supply (TES) is made up of production + imports - exports - 
international marine bunkers - international aviation bunkers ± stock 
changes. Note, exports, bunkers and stock changes incorporate the 
algebraic sign directly in the number. 
For World, TES is defined as production + imports - exports ± stock 
changes. Note, exports, bunkers and stock changes incorporate the 
algebraic sign directly in the number. 
Total energy 
supply 
TES 
Comprises interproduct transfers, products transferred and recycled 
products. 
Interproduct transfers results from reclassification of products either because 
their specification has changed or because they are blended into another 
product, e.g. kerosene may be reclassified as gasoil after blending with the 
latter in order to meet its winter diesel specification. The net balance of 
interproduct transfers is zero. 
Products transferred is intended for oil products imported for further 
processing in refineries. For example, fuel oil imported for upgrading in a 
refinery is transferred to the feedstocks category. 
Recycled products are finished products which pass a second time through 
the marketing network, after having been once delivered to final consumers 
(e.g. used lubricants which are reprocessed). 
Transfers 
TRANSFER 
Includes the sum of the unexplained statistical differences for individual 
fuels, as they appear in the basic energy statistics. It also includes the 
statistical differences that arise because of the variety of conversion factors 
in the coal and oil columns.

Transformation processes 
Flow 
Short name 
Definition 
Transformation processes comprise the conversion of primary forms 
of energy to secondary and further transformation (e.g. coking coal to 
coke, crude oil to oil products, and fuel oil to electricity). Inputs to 
transformation processes are shown as negative numbers and output 
from the process is shown as a positive number. Transformation 
losses will appear in the “total” column as negative numbers. 
Transformation 
processes 
TOTTRANF 
Refers to plants which are designed to produce electricity only. If 
one or more units of the plant is a CHP unit (and the inputs and 
outputs cannot be distinguished on a unit basis) then the whole 
plant is designated as a CHP plant. Main activity producers 
generate electricity for sale to third parties, as their primary 
activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. Note that the 
sale need not take place through the public grid.

MAINELEC 
Refers to plants which are designed to produce electricity only. If 
one or more units of the plant is a CHP unit (and the inputs and 
outputs cannot be distinguished on a unit basis) then the whole 
plant is designated as a CHP plant. Autoproducer undertakings 
generate electricity wholly or partly for their own use as an activity 
which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or 
publicly owned. 
Autoproducer 
electricity plants 
AUTOELEC 
Refers to plants which are designed to produce both heat and 
electricity (sometimes referred to as co-generation power 
stations). If possible, fuel inputs and electricity/heat outputs are on 
a unit basis rather than on a plant basis. However, if data are not 
available on a unit basis, the convention for defining a CHP plant 
noted above should be adopted. Main activity producers generate 
electricity and/or heat for sale to third parties, as their primary 
activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. Note that the 
sale need not take place through the public grid. 
Main activity

MAINCHP 
Refers to plants which are designed to produce both heat and 
electricity (sometimes referred to as co-generation power 
stations). If possible, fuel inputs and electricity/heat outputs are on 
a unit basis rather than on a plant basis. However, if data are not 
available on a unit basis, the convention for defining a CHP plant 
noted above should be adopted. Note that for autoproducer CHP 
plants, all fuel inputs to electricity production are taken into 
account, while only the part of fuel inputs to heat sold is shown. 
Fuel inputs for the production of heat consumed within the 
autoproducer's establishment are not included here but are 
included with figures for the final consumption of fuels in the 
appropriate consuming sector. Autoproducer undertakings 
generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use 
as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be 
privately or publicly owned. 
Autoproducer CHP 
plants 
AUTOCHP 
Refers to plants (including heat pumps and electric boilers) 
designed to produce heat only and who sell heat to a third party 
(e.g. residential, commercial or industrial consumers) under the 
provisions of a contract. Main activity producers generate heat for 
sale to third parties, as their primary activity. They may be 
privately or publicly owned. Note that the sale need not take place 
through the public grid.

Short name 
Definition 
Refers to plants (including heat pumps and electric boilers) 
designed to produce heat only and who sell heat to a third party 
(e.g. residential, commercial or industrial consumers) under the 
provisions of a contract. Autoproducer undertakings generate 
heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which 
supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly

Autoproducer heat 
plants 
AUTOHEAT 
Includes heat produced by heat pumps in transformation. Heat 
pumps that are operated within the residential sector where the 
heat is not sold are not considered a transformation process and 
are not included here – the electricity consumption would appear 
as residential use. 
Heat pumps 
THEAT 
Electric boilers 
TBOILER 
Includes electric boilers used to produce heat. 
Chemical heat for 
electricity production 
Includes heat from chemical processes that is used to generate 
electricity. 
TELE 
Includes the production of recovered gases (e.g. blast furnace gas 
and oxygen steel furnace gas). The production of pig-iron from iron 
ore in blast furnaces uses fuels for supporting the blast furnace 
charge and providing heat and carbon for the reduction of the iron 
ore. Accounting for the calorific content of the fuels entering the 
process is a complex matter as transformation (into blast furnace gas) 
and consumption (heat of combustion) occur simultaneously. Some 
carbon is also retained in the pig-iron; almost all of this reappears 
later in the oxygen steel furnace gas (or converter gas) when the pig-
iron is converted to steel. In the 1992/1993 annual questionnaires, 
member countries were asked for the first time to report in 
transformation processes the quantities of all fuels (e.g. pulverised 
coal injection [PCI] coal, coke oven coke, natural gas and oil) entering 
blast furnaces and the quantity of blast furnace gas and oxygen steel 
furnace gas produced. The IEA Secretariat then needed to split these 
inputs into the transformation and consumption components. The 
transformation component is shown in the row blast furnaces in the 
column appropriate for the fuel, and the consumption component is 
shown in the row iron and steel, in the column appropriate for the fuel. 
The IEA Secretariat decided to assume a transformation efficiency 
such that the carbon input into the blast furnaces should equal the 
carbon output. This is roughly equivalent to assuming an energy 
transformation efficiency of 40%.

aviation - commercial, private, agricultural, etc. It includes use 
for purposes other than flying, e.g. bench testing of engines, 
but not airline use of fuel for road transport. The 
domestic/international split should be determined on the basis 
of departure and landing locations and not by the nationality 
of the airline. Note that this may include journeys of 
considerable length between two airports in a country (e.g. 
San Francisco to Honolulu). For many countries this 
incorrectly includes fuel used by domestically owned carriers 
for outbound international traffic.

For OECD countries: 
The main source of these series for 1970 to 2020 when 
available is the OECD National Accounts Statistics 
database [ISSN: 2221-433X (online)], last published in 
book format as National Accounts of OECD Countries, 
Volume 2022 Issue 1: Detailed Tables, OECD 2022. Data 
for 1960 to 1969 have been estimated using the growth 
rates from the population series published in the OECD 
Factbook 2015 (online database version). Growth rates 
from the OECD Factbook 2015 were also used to estimate 
data for Chile (prior to 1986), Estonia (prior to 1993), 
Israel (prior to 1995), the Slovak Republic (prior to 1990) 
and Slovenia (prior to 1995). Data for Colombia (prior to 
1985), Latvia (prior to 1995) and Lithuania (prior to 1995) 
are IEA Secretariat estimates based on GDP growth rates 
from the World Bank. 
Population (millions)

For non-OECD countries:  
The main source of the population data is World

Population data for Former Soviet Union (before 1990), 
Chinese Taipei, Former Yugoslavia (before 1990), 
Eritrea (2012-2020), Kuwait (1992-1994) and for a few 
countries within the regions Other Africa, Other non-
OECD Americas and Other non-OECD Asia are based 
on the CHELEM-CEPII online database, Bureau van Dijk, 
Paris, 2022. Population data for Cyprus 1 are taken from 
the Eurostat online database.  
Please note that sources for GDP were changed from

Petroleum coke is defined as a black solid residue, obtained mainly 
by cracking and carbonising of petroleum derived feedstocks, 
vacuum bottoms, tar and pitches in processes such as delayed 
coking or fluid coking. It consists mainly of carbon (90 to 95%) and 
has a low ash content. It is used as a feedstock in coke ovens for the 
steel industry, for heating purposes, for electrode manufacture and 
for production of chemicals. The two most important qualities are 
"green coke" and "calcined coke". This category also includes 
"catalyst coke" deposited on the catalyst during refining processes: 
this coke is not recoverable and is usually burned as refinery fuel.

energy statistics. Therefore, the non-energy use of biomass is not 
taken into consideration and the quantities are null by definition. 
Primary solid 
biofuels 
PRIMSBIO 
Biogases are gases arising from the anaerobic fermentation of 
biomass and the gasification of solid biomass (including biomass in 
wastes). The biogases from anaerobic fermentation are composed 
principally of methane and carbon dioxide and comprise landfill gas, 
sewage sludge gas and other biogases from anaerobic fermentation. 
Biogases can also be produced from thermal processes (by 
gasification or pyrolysis) of biomass and are mixtures containing 
hydrogen and carbon monoxide (usually known as syngas) along 
with other components. These gases may be further processed to 
modify their composition and can be further processed to produce

feedstock. 
Biogasoline includes bioethanol (ethanol produced from biomass 
and/or the biodegradable fraction of waste), biomethanol (methanol 
produced from biomass and/or the biodegradable fraction of waste), 
bioETBE (ethyl-tertio-butyl-ether produced on the basis of 
bioethanol; the percentage by volume of bioETBE that is calculated 
as biofuel is 47%) and bioMTBE (methyl-tertio-butyl-ether produced 
on the basis of biomethanol: the percentage by volume of bioMTBE 
that is calculated as biofuel is 36%). Biogasoline includes the 
amounts that are blended into the gasoline - it does not include the 
total volume of gasoline into which the biogasoline is blended.

Hydro energy represents the potential and kinetic energy of water 
converted into electricity in hydroelectric plants. 
Hydro 
HYDRO 
Geothermal energy is the energy available as heat emitted from 
within the earth’s crust, usually in the form of hot water or steam. It is 
exploited at suitable sites: 
Geothermal 
GEOTHERM 
• 
for electricity generation using dry stream or high enthalpy brine 
after flashing 
•  directly as heat for district heating, agriculture, etc. 
Solar 
photovoltaics 
SOLARPV 
Electricity from photovoltaic cells. 
Solar energy is the solar radiation exploited for hot water production 
and electricity generation, by: 
• 
flat  plate  collectors,  mainly  of  the  thermosyphon  type,  for 
domestic  hot  water  or  for  the  seasonal  heating  of  swimming 
pools 
Solar thermal 
SOLARTH 
•  solar thermal-electric plants 
Passive solar energy for the direct heating, cooling and lighting of 
dwellings or other buildings is not included. 
Tide, wave and ocean represents the mechanical energy derived from 
tidal movement, wave motion or ocean current and exploited for 
electricity generation. 
Tide, wave and 
ocean 
TIDE 
Wind energy represents the kinetic energy of wind exploited for 
electricity generation in wind turbines. 
Wind 
WIND 
Other sources includes production not included elsewhere such as 
fuel cells. 
Other sources 
OTHER 
Gross electricity production is measured at the terminals of all 
alternator sets in a station; it therefore includes the energy taken by 
station auxiliaries and losses in transformers that are considered 
integral parts of the station. 
The difference between gross and net production is generally 
estimated as 7% for conventional thermal stations, 1% for hydro 
stations, and 6% for nuclear, geothermal and solar stations. 
Production in hydro stations includes production from pumped 
storage plants. 
Electricity 
ELECTR 
Heat production includes all heat produced by main activity producer 
CHP and heat plants, as well as heat sold by autoproducer CHP and 
heat plants to third parties.  
Fuels used to produce quantities of heat for sale are included in the 
transformation processes under the rows CHP plants and Heat 
plants. The use of fuels for heat which is not sold is included under 
the sectors in which the fuel use occurs. Data on heat have become 
available in different years for different countries and thus any 
aggregated data should be used with caution.

Country notes and sources  
OECD countries 
General notes 
The  notes  given  in  this  document  refer  to  data  for  the  years  1960  to  2021 
published  in  the  on-line  data  service.  In  general,  more  detailed  notes  are 
available for data starting in 1990. 
Data  are  obtained  through  annual  submission  of  five  fuel  questionnaires  from 
national administrations, as indicated for each country in the section on sources.  
In  some  instances  it  has  been  necessary  for  the  IEA  Secretariat  to  estimate 
some data; explanations of the estimates are provided in the country notes. For 
more  information  on  fuel-specific  methodologies,  please  refer  to  the  IEA 
information  publications  (Oil 
information,  Natural  Gas 
information,  Coal 
information,  Electricity  information  and  Renewables  information).  Energy  data 
reported  for  2021  (shown  as  2021E)  in  the  final  release  are  provisional  supply 
and demand data based on submissions received in early 2022 and on monthly 
submissions to the IEA from member countries. 
This section lists a few specific notes that apply to all countries, and it is followed 
by a time series of comprehensive country-specific notes by fuel and flow. 
Prior to 1974, most fuel inputs and electricity and heat outputs for autoproducers 
are  included  in  main  activity  producers.  The  figures  for  the  quantities  of  fuels 
used for the generation of electricity and heat and the corresponding outputs in 
CHP and heat plants should be used with caution. Despite estimates introduced 
by  the  IEA  Secretariat,  inputs  and  outputs  are  not  always  consistent.  Please 
refer to notes below under Electricity and heat.  
Data  for  anthracite,  coking  coal,  other  bituminous  coal,  sub-bituminous  coal  and 
lignite are available separately from 1978. Prior to 1978, only data for hard coal 
and brown coal (lignite/sub-bituminous coal) are available. 
In 1996, the IEA Secretariat extensively revised data on coal and coke use in blast 
furnaces,  and  in  the  iron  and  steel  industry  (for  those  countries  with  blast

furnaces),  based  on  data  provided  to  the  OECD  Steel  Committee  and  other 
sources.  The  quantities  of  fuels  transformed  into  blast  furnace  gas  have  been 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat based on its blast furnace model. 
For  biofuels  and  waste  (i.e. solid  biofuels,  biogases,  liquid  biofuels,  industrial 
waste  and municipal  waste),  there  may  be  breaks  in  time  series  between  1988 
and 1989, as in 1997 the IEA Secretariat extensively revised these data based 
on  data  from  Eurostat  (for  the  EU-15  member  countries)  and  on  other  national 
sources  for  other  OECD  member  countries,  and  data  from  Eurostat  were 
generally  available  from  1989.  Generally,  data  on  biofuels  and  waste  are 
reported in non-specified prior to 1989.

General notes 
All data refer to the fiscal year (e.g. July 2019 to June 2020 for 2020). 
Starting with the 2013 edition and following, data for Australia were revised back 
to  2003  due  to the  adoption  of the  National  Greenhouse  and  Energy  Reporting 
(NGER) as the main energy consumption data source for the Australian Energy 
Statistics. As a result, there are breaks in the time series for many data between 
2002 and 2003. The revisions have also introduced some methodological issues, 
including identifying inputs and outputs to certain transformation processes such 
as gas works plants, electricity plants and CHP plants. Energy industry own use 
and  inputs  to  the  transformation  processes  are  sometimes  not  reported 
separately in the correct categories. More detail is given in the notes below. 
Coal  
General notes 
Stock  change  and  statistical  difference  are  both  subject  to  further  review  for 
black coal grade by the Australian administration. 
In  the  2022,  2021  and  2020  editions,  part  of  the  demand  side  data  for  other 
bituminous  coal,  subbituminous  coal,  lignite  and  coal  tar  have  been 
estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  for  the  years  2018,  2019  and  2020.  Due  to 
confidentiality  reasons,  some  flows  for  those  products  were  suppressed  in  the 
data  submission  to  the  IEA.  The  figures  estimated  have  been  qualified  in  the 
dataset  as  estimated.  Some  subtotals  are  not  qualified  as  estimated  but  many 
flows within them are, this is because the subtotals were submitted but not their 
breakdown or part of it. 
In the 2022, 2021 and 2020 editions, part of the demand side for anthracite is 
confidential.  Some  of  the  quantities  reported  under  “Industry,  not  elsewhere 
specified” could refer to other flows.

In  the  2021  edition,  the  split  between  underground  and  surface  production  of 
coking  coal  and  other  bituminous  coal  was  revised  back  to  2015  based  on 
new available data. 
In the 2017 edition, the Australian administration revised data on coal tar back 
to 2010 resulting in breaks in time series between 2009 and 2010. 
In  the  2016  edition,  extensive  revisions  were  made  to  2010  to  2013  data  for 
many  primary  and  manufactured  products  causing  breaks  in  production,  trade 
and consumption between 2009 and 2010. Time series which begin in 2010 may 
be reported in other flows until 2009. 2014 data were reported on the same basis 
as 2010 to 2013. 
In  the  2015  edition,  increases  of  production  and  consumption  of  other 
bituminous  coal  for  2013  are  due  to  both  new  mine  capacity  and  improved 
classification  data.  In  the  2016  edition,  these  revisions  were  extended  back  to 
2010. Apparent switching between sub-bituminous coal and other bituminous 
coal  between  2009  and  2010  suggests  that  some  other  bituminous  coal  was 
reported as sub-bituminous coal prior to this, across several flows. 
Reclassification  of  some  coal  types  in  the  2013  edition  were  calculated  on  an 
energy  basis  and  resulted  in  a  net  increase  of  quantities  of  primary  coal  from 
2003 to 2011. 
Breaks in the time series for gas works gas between 2008 and 2009 are due to 
a  change  of  survey,  while  reduced  production  and  consumption  between  2006 
and 2008 are due to the removal of some natural gas inputs. 
Data on blast furnace gas for electricity production by autoproducers begins in 
1986. 
Hard coal data prior to 1978 may include sub-bituminous coal. 
Supply  
In  2018,  a  substantial  stock  draw  of  coking  coal  followed  a  2017  stock  build 
caused by meteorological phenomena. 
The decrease of lignite production and consumption in 2017 and 2018 was due 
to  the  closure  of  brown  coal  fired  Hazelwood  power  plant  in  early  2017, 
contributing to a higher consumption of other bituminous coal. 
Only  anthracite  trade  is  reported  separately;  the  remainder  that  is  consumed 
domestically  is  included  with  other  bituminous  coal  due  to  confidentiality

requirements. There were no recorded anthracite exports or estimated anthracite 
production in 2018. 
Anthracite  production  data  are  unavailable  and  are  therefore  estimated  by  the 
Australian  administration  as  a  balance  of  trade  and  consumption.  There  is  no 
visibility over stock movements of this fuel. 
Registers  show  large  sporadic  shipments  of  anthracite  rather  than  steady 
supply streams. 
Export  trade  in  coke  oven  coke  between  2005  and  2011  exists,  but  data  are 
unavailable  for  reasons  of  confidentiality.  From  2012  onward  exports  are 
estimated  by  the  Australian  administration  but  without  providing  information  on 
the destination country. 
Transformation 
In 2015, a new plant within the mining sector started its operations increasing the 
consumption of coke oven coke. 
The  one  company  producing  BKB  closed  its  operation  during  2015.  As  such, 
production and consumption declined significantly. 
For  2003  to  2012,  coke  oven  gas  reported  as  energy  industry  own-use  in 
electricity  or  CHP  plants  is  used  for  generation  purposes,  while  natural  gas 
used for own-use plant support is reported in the transformation sector. 
Natural  gas  consumed  to  fuel  the  distribution  of  natural  gas  in  natural  gas 
networks is reported as transformation for gas works gas production until 2005. 
The  drop  in  BKB  production  in  2004  was  due  to  a  fire  in  the  main  production 
plant. 
Consumption  
Decline 
in  coking  coal  use  alongside  rising  steel  production  appears 
commensurate with process changes in Iron and Steel sector. 
In the 2016 edition, revisions for 2010 onwards have increased the quantities of 
sub-bituminous  coal  and  decreased  the  quantities  of  other  bituminous  coal 
being  used  in  the  non-metallic  minerals  industry  as  more  accurate  information 
has become available. 
Consumption  in  wood  and  wood  products  is  included  in  paper,  pulp  and  print 
from 2001 onwards.

Oil  
General notes 
In the 2022 edition, the Australian administration introduced further revisions due 
to a change in reporting methods, which included mandatory reporting obligation 
for  refineries  and  companies  in  the  oil  sector,  resulting  in  a  break  in  series 
between 2016 and 2017. 
In the 2022 edition, 2019 and 2020 data for white spirit and bitumen (except for 
trade data for the latter) are included in other oil products due to confidentiality. 
There are breaks in series between 2017 and 2018 due to a change in reporting 
methods, which includes new mandatory reporting for refineries and companies 
in the oil sector.  
Moreover,  in  the  2019  edition  the  Australian  administration  introduced  several 
revisions  to  the  time  series  back  to  2011  as  a  result  of  new  and  updated  data 
sources becoming available.  
In  2017,  the  Australian  administration  added  new  companies  to  their  reporting. 
This primarily impacts the stocks of motor gasoline and gas/diesel oil.  
Between 2009 and 2010 some breaks in time series may occur due to changes 
in methodologies and to improved data sources, with major revisions explained 
below.  
Other hydrocarbons reported under from other sources natural gas correspond 
to hydrogen used in refineries from 2011 to 2016, also represented as the output 
of non-specified transformation in the balances format. 
An  in-depth  review  of  Australian  oil  statistics,  in  particular  investigation  of 
amounts  currently  reported  under  recycled  products  as  well  as  statistical 
differences  for  motor  gasoline  and  bitumen,  is  on-going  and  may  result  in 
further improvements in the next editions. 
Supply  
In  the  2022  edition,  refinery  output  of  naphtha  (2019  and  2020)  and  aviation 
gasoline (2020) are confidential. These are included in other oil products. 
In the 2022 edition, refinery fuel use of fuel oil in 2020 is confidential. 
In the 2022 edition, stock changes are confidential for naphtha (2019 and 2020), 
for  2020).  Where 
other  kerosene  (2020)  and  gas/diesel  oil  (partially

appropriate,  these  are  included  in  other  oil  products.  Stock  breaks  may 
therefore appear. 
Part of LPG exports in 2019 is confidential. 
In  2019,  refinery  output  of  other  oil  products  increased  as  a  result  of  higher 
consumption in oil and gas extraction and improved data collection.   
In 2018, production of NGL declined as a result of product reclassification where 
quantities of condensate had previously been included and now moved to crude 
oil.  
Crude  oil  production  and  imports  continued  to  decline  in  2016  following  the 
closure of domestic refining capacity in New South Wales (Kurnell Refinery) and 
Queensland  (Bulwer  Island  Refinery).  Refinery  outputs  also  fell  as  a  result. 
These  two  sites  have  been  converted  to  import  terminals  helping  Australia 
expanding  its  import  capacity.  As  a  result  refined  products  imports  increased 
considerably in 2016. 
From  2010  crude  oil  production  estimates  for  selected  companies  have  been 
replaced by actual data.  
Imports of fuel oil have been estimated by the Australian administration. 
In the 2015 data, fuel oil imports dropped significantly due to the closure of the 
two  large  consumers  of  this  product,  the  Gove  alumina  refinery  and  the  Point 
Henry aluminium smelter. 
There  is  a  break  in  the  time  series  for  crude  oil  and  NGL  between  2001  and 
2002. 
The drop in the production of crude oil in 1999 is due to a gas explosion at the 
Longford plant. 
Prior to 1992, part of the NGL production is included in crude oil. 
Transformation 
There  is  a  break  in  the  refinery  balance  between  2010  and  2011  due  to  the 
reclassification of a facility from upstream to downstream.  
As a result of a new methodology adopted to split gas/diesel oil inputs between 
main  activity  and  autoproducer  plants,  breaks  in  series  appear  between  2009 
and 2010.

Consumption 
In  the  2022  edition,  due  to  improved  data  and  mandatory  reporting,  the 
Australian  administration  introduced  revisions  from  2016  onwards  for  LPG, 
motor  gasoline,  gas/diesel  oil,  kerosene  type  jet  fuel,  fuel  oil,  lubricants 
and other oil products. 
In  the  2021  edition,  due  to  a  change  in  the  reporting  methods,  the  Australian 
administration has reallocated some consumption of LPG, other kerosene, fuel 
oil and other oil products from the commercial and public services sector to not 
elsewhere specified (energy) for 2018 data onwards. 
In the 2021 edition, consumption of LPG, gas/diesel oil and other oil products 
in oil and gas extraction increased owing to new facilities going online in 2019. 
In  the  2021  edition,  non-energy  use  of  white  spirit  and  bitumen  in  not 
elsewhere  specified  (industry)  are  included  in  other  oil  products  due  to 
confidentiality. 
In  the  2021  edition,  there  is  a  break  between  2018  and  2019  in  the  transport 
sector consumption notably for LPG, gas/diesel oil, kerosene type jet fuel and 
fuel oil. The Australian administration intends to submit historical revisions in the 
2022 edition. 
In  2018  fuel  oil  consumption  in  the  commercial  and  public  services  sector 
increased due to the inclusion of data for a new water and waste services facility. 
In 2017 the Queensland Nickel refinery closed down and the Portland Aluminium 
refinery  was  reduced  for  an  extended  period  due  to  a  power  fault.  As  a  result 
fuel oil consumption in the non-ferrous metal sector declined in 2017.  
In  the  2019  edition  the  bitumen  time  series  was  revised  with  higher  levels  of 
consumption  for  2015  and  2016.  This  is  based  on  the  monthly  Australian 
Petroleum Statistics which now has better coverage of the consumption data.  
Breaks  in  the  time  series  appear  between  2009  and  2010  in  transport 
consumption due to a change in methodology. 
Natural gas 
General notes 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  Australian  administration  reallocated  quantities  in  the 
consumption  side,  based  on  analysis  of  new  data  and  to  be  consistent  with

Australian  Energy  Statistics.  Additionally,  revisions  were  made  to  trade  flows 
based  on  a  revised  methodology  for  calculating  the  volumes  of  imports  and 
exports. 
In  the  2019  edition,  the  Australian  administration  proceeded  to  major  revisions 
on  the  supply  side  from  2013  onwards  due  to  a  change  in  methodology  on 
production  quantities  and  more  recent  sources  on  calorific  values.  Additionally 
the  Oil  and  gas  extraction,  and  Liquefaction  (LNG)/regasification  plants  on  the 
demand  side  were  revised  from  2003  onwards,  which  resulted  in  increased 
statistical differences.  
In  the  2016  edition,  the  Australian  administration  revised  natural  gas  demand 
data  for  some  flows  back  to  2010,  resulting  in  breaks  in  time  series  between 
2009 and 2010.  
In  2015, 
the  Australian  administration 
revised  production  and  certain 
consumption  data  back  to  2006.  The  production  figures  now  include  previously 
uncaptured flows.  
Prior to 1991 natural gas data include ethane. 
Supply 
In 2021 preliminary data, there are no more exports reported due to a change in 
methodology to eliminate the reporting of transit trade.  
In 2022 edition, historical revisions were made to gas vented and gas flared back 
to 1990 due to new methodology. 
The GCV of inland consumption (calculated) has been falling since 2017 due to 
increases in liquefaction and the volume lost during this process. 
For  2018,  there  is  a  continuation  of  the  increase  in  indigenous  production 
(+15%)  and  exports  (+18%)  of  gas,  which  started  in  2017  due  to  the  LNG 
exporting capacity coming online in 2016 and 2017. 
Around  30%  of  the  production  (mainly  coal  seam  gas)  is  estimated  by  the 
Australian administration. 
Transformation  
From 2011 to 2016, the Non-specified transformation of natural gas represents 
amounts used to produce hydrogen for hydrodesulphurization in refineries.

Until 2005, natural gas consumed to fuel the distribution of natural gas in natural 
gas networks was reported as transformation for gas works gas production. 
Consumption 
In  2022  edition,  historical  revisions  were  made  to  distribution  losses  due  to  a 
new source for this data. 
Consumption  in  the  residential  and  agriculture/forestry  sectors  is  estimated  by 
the Australian administration based on models. 
There are breaks between 2002 and 2003 in due to major revisions made in the 
Oil  and  gas  extraction,  and  Liquefaction  (LNG)/regasification  plants  in  the 
context of the 2019 edition. 
Between 2009 and 2010 some breaks in time series may occur due to changes 
in  methodologies  and  to  improved  data  sources.  Revisions  to  the  consumption 
data  include  changes  to  energy  use  in  liquefaction  plants,  and  a  shift  of  gas 
works  gas  (transformation)  to  non-specified  energy  from  2006  onwards. 
Revisions to previous years are pending. 
Between  2001  and  2002  there  are  breaks  in  time  series  for  consumption  data 
due to an industry structural shift and changes in methodology. 
Data  for  1999  and  2000  end-use  consumption  are  estimated  by  the  Australian 
administration. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
In  the  2018  edition,  biogases  were  revised  downward  by  the  Australian 
administration  back  to  2015  as  a  result  of  the  removal  on  1  July  2015  of  a 
production  subsidy  for  domestic  ethanol.  The  subsidy  was  equal  to  the  excise 
rate on unleaded petrol.  
A large biogas production facility did not report any production in 2016-2017. In 
2017, this led to reductions in the consumption of biogases in auto CHP plants 
and the commercial and public services sector. 
Increases  in  production  of  solid  biofuels  since  2014  are  related  to  incentives 
under  the  Renewable  Energy  Target  legislation,  which  went  into  effect  in  2001 
and aims to increase the share of electricity generation from renewable sources.

The data for biogasoline and biodiesel are not available before 2003 and 2004 
respectively. 
From 1996, a different industry consumption breakdown for biofuels and waste is 
available and leads to breaks in time series. 
Supply  
Biogas production data at sewage treatment works are not available. 
Indigenous  production  of  biodiesel  has  decreased  substantially  starting  with 
2016 data because one of the major biodiesel producers ceased production in 
January  2016.  The  trend  continues  in  2017,  when,  according  to  Bioenergy 
Australia, low oil prices and higher feedstock prices created a difficult market for 
the remaining biodiesel producers. The trend continues in 2018 data. 
Production  of  biogasoline  (ethanol)  decreased  since  the  Ethanol  Production 
Grants Programme ended on 30 June 2015. On 1 July 2015, the fuel excise on 
domestically produced ethanol was reduced to zero and will be increased by 2.5 
cents  per  litre  until  it  reaches  12.5  cents  per  litre.  Additionally,  2017  quantities 
were also affected by low oil prices. 
Consumption 
In the 2018 edition, solid biofuels were revised back to 2010 by the Australian 
administration,  expanding  the  scope  from  the  revisions  in  the  2016  and  2017 
editions  to  indigenous  production  and  consumption  sectors  which  weren’t 
previously revised. This results in a break in time series between 2009 and 2010.  
 In  the  2017  edition  of  this  publication,  there  has  been  a  revision  to  the  time 
series  of  solid  biofuels  consumption  in  “Paper,  pulp  and  printing”  sector.  This 
time  series  has  been  revised  back  to  2010  resulting  in  break  in  time  series 
between 2009 and 2010. 
In  the  2016  edition  of  this  publication,  the  Australian  administration  revised 
primary  solid  biofuels back  to  2010  which  impact mostly  final  consumption  in 
food and tobacco. This created breaks in time series. 
The consumption data of biogases in industry is not available before 2003.

Electricity and heat 
General notes 
In  the  2016  edition,  several  combustible  fuel  electricity  production  time  series 
as  well  as  some  electricity  consumption  time  series  were  revised  by  the 
Australian administration back to 2010 in order to limit the use of estimated data 
and are causing some breaks. 
From 1992 onwards, heat data are not available. 
Supply 
Data for production of electricity from wind are available from 1994. 
Data for electricity production from solar photovoltaic start in 1992 and from solar 
thermal in 2003. 
Transformation  
For  2018  data,  electricity  output from lignite  declined  due  to the  closure  of the 
Hazelwood  power  plant.  In  addition,  there  was  no  output  from  BKB  due  to  the 
closure  of  both  Hazelwood  power  plant,  and  the  only  briquette  manufacturer  in 
Australia. 
Fuels used for generation by autoproducers represent single fuel-fired units only. 
The  use  of  fuel  in  multi-fired  units  operated  by  autoproducers  is  included  in 
industry consumption. 
In  the  2018  edition,  new  methodologies  were  introduced  by  the  Australian 
administration  for  reporting  electricity  production  from  solar  sources.  First,  the 
methodology  for  reporting  electricity  production  from  solar  PV  and  solar 
thermal  was  changed  between  2009  and  2010,  resulting  in  a  break  in  time 
series. Prior to 2010, the ratio of electricity production from solar thermal to total 
solar  was  assumed  to  be  the  same  each  year.  After  2010,  solar  PV 
autoproducer electricity production is the residual after the main activity solar PV 
and  solar  thermal  are  deducted  from  total  solar  production.  There  is  an 
additional  break  in  time  series  between  2013  and  2014  for  solar  production 
when  a  new  methodology  for  determining  large-scale  solar  PV  production  was 
introduced for main activity solar PV plants. 
In  the  2017  edition,  following  an  extended  review  of  past  data,  the  Australian 
administration  revised  electricity  outputs  of  blast  furnace  gas  autoproducer

electricity  plants  for  the  period  2003-2004  and  of  autoproducer  CHP  plants 
fuelled by other oil products for 2009, resulting in more realistic efficiency rates 
for these plants.   
In 2002, the Australian administration started to use a new survey methodology 
and  reclassified  the  types  of  plants  between  main  activity  producers  and 
autoproducers. 
Prior to 1995, electricity production from biogases is included in natural gas. 
Prior  to  1986,  inputs  and  outputs  from  autoproducer  CHP  plants  are  not 
available. 
Consumption 
In  the  2022  and  2021  editions,  the  Australian  administration  revised  sectoral 
consumption  data  back  to  2009  to  incorporate  a  change  of  methodology.  In 
particular,  data  for  Construction  were  significantly  revised  in  the  2022  edition. 
This also affected transmission and distribution losses which act as a balancing 
item. Breaks may occur between 2008 and 2009. 
The  significant  growth  in  electricity  consumption  at  LNG/regasification  plants  in 
2016  and  2017,  is  due  to  the  commencement  of  large-scale  production  at 
Australia’s new east coast LNG plants. 
From  1990  to  2008,  electricity  consumption  in  wood  and  wood  products  is 
included together with paper, pulp and printing. 
Prior  to  2006,  electricity  consumption  in  mining  and  quarrying  includes 
consumption in liquefaction/regasification plants. 
The  direct  use  of  solar  heat  (mostly  domestic  solar  panels)  is  available  from 
1974. 
Electricity  consumption  in  coke  ovens  has  been  estimated  by  the  Australian 
administration from 1974 to 1999. 
Prior  to  1974,  the  breakdown  of  electricity  consumption  in  industry  and  energy 
sub-sectors  is  not  available  and  energy  industry  consumption  is  included  in 
industry. 
Electricity consumption in the non-specified transport sector represents transport 
support services, including those for air and water transport, and for transport for 
mining operations.

General notes 
Starting  with  the  2016  edition  and  following,  widespread  data  revisions  were 
received  due  to  enhanced  reporting  from  2005  onwards  as  a  consequence  of 
improved  Austrian  Final  Energy  Consumption  surveys.  For  some  time  series, 
these  revisions  were  extrapolated  back to  1990. As  a  consequence,  there  may 
be breaks between 2004 and 2005, and 1989 and 1990. For more details on the 
methodologies in the revisions in the energy balance, there is more information

Coal 
General notes 
In the 2021 edition, revisions were made in several products for the period 2005-
2018, most of them were small in absolute and/or relative value. 
In  the  2019  edition,  revisions  concerning  the  iron  and  steel  industry  were 
received for data since 2005. The revisions impacted the energy sector for coke 
oven gas and blast furnace gas. 
In 2018 data, blast furnace gas decreased following maintenance work in one 
of the blast furnaces. Additionally, other recovered gases (LD-gas) are reported 
separately  following  an  improvement  in  reporting  from  the  2020  edition  (in 
previous editions it was reported under blast furnace gas). 
The  last  lignite  mine  closed  in  the  second  quarter  of  2004  and  lignite  use  for 
power generation ceased in 2006.

Since  1996,  gas  works  gas  data  are  reported  with  natural  gas  because  it  is 
distributed in the same network. The amount of gas works gas is negligible and 
it is mostly consumed by households. 
“Trockenkohle” is included with BKB because of its high calorific value. 
Supply  
In  2018  there  were  high  values  of  patent  fuel  imported  and  consumed  in  the 
paper and pulp industry, which was not the case in 2019. 
Consumption  
One  of  the  revisions  made  in  the  2021  edition  was  the  reallocation  of  some 
quantities  from  Blast  furnace  (energy)  to  Coke  oven  (Energy)  for  the  products 
blast furnace gas, coke oven gas and other recovered gases. 
Among  the  revisions  made  in  the  2021  edition,  some  quantities  of  coke  oven 
coke were reallocated from the industry Iron & Steel (TFC) to the category Non-
Energy Use-Chemical/ Petrochemical. 
Oil 
General notes 
In  the  2022  edition, revisions  in  the time  series for  gas/diesel  oil  deliveries for 
international marine bunkers appear as a result of a change in the methodology 
reported  by  the  Federal  Environment  Agency  to  Statistics  Austria.  As  a 
consequence  of  this  change  in  methodology,  revisions  also  appear  for 
gas/diesel oil consumption in road transport and domestic navigation from 1990 
onwards.  
Supply  
In the 2021 edition, the Austrian administration revised the stock levels (national 
territory)  of  motor  gasoline  (from  2006  onwards)  and  fuel  oil  (from  2005 
onwards)  but  with  the  stock  changes  preserved  as  in  the  previous  edition.  A 
stock break appears for fuel oil between 2004 and 2005. 
In  the  2016  edition,  exports  of  naphtha  are  no  longer  reported from  2014,  past 
values may refer to exports of petrochemical raw material. 
Deliveries  of  gas/diesel  to  international  marine  bunkers  were  revised  back  to 
1990 after implementation of a new study results.

Prior to 1990, a portion of naphtha is included with other oil products. 
Transformation 
In  the  2019  edition  the  administration  incorporated  revisions  as  a  result  of 
improved  reporting from  the refinery to  Statistics  Austria.  As  a  result there may 
be breaks in the time series between 2004 and 2005.  
Natural gas  
Supply  
In the 2021 preliminary data, there is no longer Exports reported due to a change 
in methodology to eliminate the reporting of transit trade.  
In the 2022 edition, the time series for Opening and Closing stock level (National 
Territory) was revised in Terajoules from 1990 onwards due to new information 
becoming available from data providers. 
Export  amounts  are  calculated  by  the  national  administration  by  subtracting 
stock changes and domestic consumption from import figures. 
Transformation  
In the 2018 edition, the time series for blast furnaces was reclassified from 1990 
onwards,  and  thus  moved  from  the  Transformation  to  the  Energy  sector.  This 
has resulted in increasing the efficiency of the blast furnaces process. 
Between  1995  and  1996  there  is  a  break  in  time  series  for  autoproducer 
electricity and CHP plants due to the availability of more detailed data. 
Consumption  
In the 2019 edition, Austrian administration revised oil and gas extraction and oil 
refinery natural gas consumption data for 2005 onwards based on data reported 
to the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Additionally, it revised data since 2005 
for  other  sectors’  flows  since  2005  and  industry  sector  since  2012  based  on  a 
combination of the results of sample surveys and data from the regulator. 
Any inconsistencies in the time series for commercial/public services until 2011 
are  the  result  of  this  sub-sector  being  computed  as  a  residual.  Since  2012  the 
commercial/public  services  consumption  figures  are  surveyed  annually  and  the 
consumption  quantities  in  small  and  medium  enterprises  in  industry  are  the

projected  results  of  biannual  sample  surveys.  The  increase  in  pipeline  transport 
consumption  for  2013  is  due  to  a  new  methodology  of  data  collection.  Historical 
revisions  are  pending.  Prior  to  2000,  differences  due  to  measurement  are 
included with distribution losses. 
Biofuels and waste  
General notes 
Data for 1986 to 1989 for solid biofuels, industrial waste, biogases and liquid 
biofuels  are  IEA  Secretariat  estimates  based  on  information  published  by 
OSTAT in Energieversongung Österreichs Endgültige Energiebilanz. 
Consumption  
In the 2016 edition, improvement in the iron and steel industry data have allowed 
more  precision  in  the  consumption,  among  other  for  industrial  waste  in  blast 
furnaces. 
In  the  2016  edition,  the  consumption  of  solid  biofuels  in  the  residential  sector 
was revised down from 2005 data. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply 
Amounts for both net electricity production and plant own use are calculated by 
the Austrian administration by applying a fixed percentage multiplier to the gross 
production of all plants in the public grid, regardless of plant type or fuel.  
Electricity  production  from  geothermal  main  electricity  plants  only  refers  to 
electricity that is fed into the grid. Total production is not known as these plants 
are below the reporting threshold. 
Transformation 
For  2020,  the  decrease  in  electricity  and  heat  output  from  other  bituminous 
coal was in part due to the closure of a power plant.  
Electricity only plant data may include some CHP plants operating in electricity 
only mode. In addition, fuel inputs to and electricity outputs from CHP plants are 
re-allocated  from  CHP  to  electricity-only  plants  if  the  implied  CHP  efficiency 
would fall below 75%.

Fluctuating efficiencies from year to year for solid biofuel and industrial waste 
plants  are  related  to  operational  decisions  which  are  governed  by  a  formula 
described in the Standard documentation Meta information on Energy balances 
for  Austria  and the  Laender  of  Austria  published  in  June  2016  on the  Statistics 
Austria website. 
In  the  2018  edition,  electricity  production  from  municipal  waste  main  activity 
electricity plants was revised from 2003-2009. Additionally, electricity production 
from municipal waste main activity CHP plants was revised in 2014.  
A  large  autoproducer  electricity  plant  was  reclassified  as  an  autoproducer  CHP 
plant and therefore creates a break in time series for municipal waste in 2011.  
In  2009,  inputs  of  other  oil  products  to  autoproducer  CHP  plants  were 
reclassified as refinery gas and natural gas. 
Due to a change in the survey methodology, the heat produced in small plants 
(capacity inferior to 1 MW) is not reported starting in 2002. 
Heat from chemical processes used for electricity production is available from 
2000. 
Electricity generation from geothermal started in 2002. 
Prior to 2002, data for biogases only include plants of 1 MW or larger.  
Prior to 1981, inputs to main activity producer electricity plants include inputs to 
CHP  plants.  All  electricity  production  by  CHP  plants  is  included  in  electricity 
plants, and only production from combustible fuel sources is taken into account. 
Autoproducer  CHP  heat  production  is  included  in  main  activity  producer  CHP 
plants. For heat, own use is included in distribution losses. 
Consumption  
For  2021p,  electricity  consumption  in  the  Energy  sector  may  include  some 
transformation  inputs  to  pumped  hydro.  The  Austrian  Administration  hope  to 
revise this in the upcoming cycle. 
In the 2020 edition, Austria revised consumption data back to 2013 based on a 
new methodology for disaggregating consumption across sectors.  
In  the  2020  edition,  a  large  portion  of  electricity  consumption  in  blast  furnaces 
was reallocated to iron and steel sector from 1990 to 2004. This creates breaks 
in-series in these timeseries between 2004 and 2005. Revisions to data for 2005 
onwards are expected in a future edition.

Electricity  consumption 
in  Road 
includes 
trams, 
trolleybuses,  subways, 
cableways, chair- and drag-lifts, as well as 100% electric vehicles. 
In  the  2019  edition,  Austria  revised  data  back  to  2005  in  order  to  present 
international  reporting  as  consistent  as  possible  with  the  national  energy 
balances.  In  addition,  consumption  figures  were  revised  based  on  more  recent 
surveys of energy consumption in small and medium-sized enterprises. Outliers 
and  the  extrapolation  methodology  will  be  revised  following  the  results  of  the 
next survey.  
Electricity  consumption  in  oil  refineries  includes  consumption  in  gas  works 
plants prior to 1991.  
From 1990 to 2009, small amounts of electricity used in heat pumps have been 
included in the residential sector. 
Starting  in  1990,  consumption  of  electricity  in  the  field  of  electricity  supply, 
district heating and water supply are included in other energy industry own use, 
prior to that it was included in commercial/public services. 
Also prior to 1991, electricity consumption in the iron and steel industry includes 
consumption in coke ovens and blast furnaces.

Coal  
General notes 
For the  year  2020, the  trade flows for  anthracite  include transit trade. This  will 
be amended in the next publication (2022). 
Oil shales and sub-bituminous coal have been grouped due to confidentiality 
reasons. 
In  the  2020  edition,  data  from  2013  was  revised,  and  sub-bituminous  coal 
figures are now reported under this category, whilst previously they were under 
other bituminous coal. BKB figures has been also revised back to 2013.  
In  the  2016  edition,  improved  data  collection  has  led  to  some  breaks  in  time 
series.  These  revisions 
include  hard  coal  classifications,  products  and 
processes in integrated iron and steel manufacture and may be extended further 
back in future editions. 
Data  for  anthracite  prior  to  2014  may  include  a  small  portion  of  other 
bituminous coal.  
Hard coal data prior to 1978 may include sub-bituminous coal. 
Other  bituminous  coal  and  sub-bituminous  coal  data  reported  in  from  other 
sources refer to coal recuperated from coal dumps. 
Supply  
Supply-side  data  are  obtained  through  surveying  questionnaires  instead  of 
customs data. 
Transit  trade  is  excluded.  For  each  country  (trade  partner),  the  imported  and 
exported  quantities  are  compared  and  cleared.  In  the  case  of  Belgium,  this 
decreases the final figure of exports. 2019 data shows a rise in exports of other 
bituminous  coal; the  imports  decreased  during  that  year  but  some  companies

continued to export the stocks originated from those countries in 2019, leading to 
this rise. 
In  the  2019  edition,  the  calorific  values  of  imported  bituminous  coal  were 
revised  upwards  by  the  Belgian  administration  since  2015,  resulting  in  a 
significant  increase  in  the  coal  primary  energy  supply.  Historical  revisions  are 
pending.  
Conventional production of other bituminous coal ceased on 31 August 1992. 
Transformation 
In  the  2019  edition,  anthracite  previously  reported  as  consumption  in  the  iron 
and steel industry was reclassified as part of the transformation process in blast 
furnaces since 2013. 
In 2016, the decrease of other bituminous coal inputs to main activity producer 
electricity  plants  was  due  to  the  permanent  closure  of  Langerlo,  Belgium’s  last 
coal-fired main activity electricity. 
In  2015,  the  decrease  of  coke  oven  gas  inputs  to  autoproducer  CHP  plants  is 
due to a power plant closure in 2015.  
In  2014  and  2015,  coking  coal  inputs to  coke ovens  decreased  due to  a coke 
oven closure in June 2014. 
In 2014, the decrease of other bituminous coal inputs to main activity producer 
electricity plants is due to a power plant closure in 2014. 
Consumption  
In  the  2021  edition,  consumption  of  other  bituminous  coal  in  the  sectors  of 
Transport/Rail and Other sectors/Agriculture were included starting in 2015. 
In the 2018 edition, industrial consumption for the period 2013 through 2015 was 
revised  for  coking  coal  and  anthracite,  as  more  accurate  consumption  data 
became available. Data for coking coal prior to 2013 may include a small portion 
of anthracite. 
The  decrease  of  other  bituminous  coal  and  coke  oven  coke  in  the  iron  and 
steel industry in 2002 is due to the closure of several plants. 
The  use  of  coke  oven  gas  in  chemical  and  petrochemical  activities  ceased  in 
1996.

Oil  
General notes 
Between  2008  and  2009  breaks  in  series  occur  for  naphtha  and  LPG  in  both 
transformation  and  final  consumption  in  the  petrochemical  sector  as  a  result  of 
methodological improvements made by the Belgian administration.  
Data on biofuels are not available before 2009. 
Other hydrocarbons correspond to pure hydrogen used in refineries. 
Supply  
Following  a  change  in  legislation,  there  is  an  increase  in  blended  biodiesel  in 
2020. 
In the 2022 edition, the Belgian administration revised petroleum coke imports 
and inland deliveries from 2015 onwards. 
In 2019, the increase in refinery gross output of petroleum coke is due to a new 
delayed coker unit.  
In  2018,  increase  in  imports  and  deliveries  for  international  marine  bunkers  of 
residual fuel oil is due to the inclusion of volumes of aromatic oils. 
In 2017 new legislation increased the biofuel blending target for motor gasoline 
from  4%  of  volume  to  8.5%  of  volume.  As  part  of  this  E10  gasoline  was 
introduced and became the new standard product in the country.  
In the 2019 edition, the Belgian administration included new companies in their 
reporting;  some  of  which  are  particularly  active  in  the  production  and  trade  of 
lubricants and bitumen.  
Consumption  in  international  marine  bunkers  dipped  in  2014  and  2015  due  to 
the  closure  of  several  bunkering  companies.  During  2015  these  were  replaced 
by new companies which became fully operational in 2016. 
Starting from 2013, a new data source was introduced for petroleum coke trade. 
Transformation 
In  2017  the  upgrade  project  of  Antwerp  refinery  and  petrochemical  plant  was 
completed.  Two  key  projects  were  completed:  new  refinery  capacity  for  the 
conversion of heavy fuel oil into low sulphur light products and increasing steam

cracker flexibility to maximize the processing of low cost advantaged feedstock. 
The latter is reflected in feedstock needs. Output of lighter end products as well 
as petroleum coke is impacted by these upgrades. 
In  2002,  patent fuel  plants  used fuel  oil to  increase  the  calorific  value  of patent 
fuel. 
Consumption 
In the 2021 edition, the Belgian administration revised the consumption data for 
lubricants  from  2010  onwards  as  a  result  of  the  identification  of  new  active 
players in the market. Breaks may occur in the series between 2009 and 2010. 
In  2018,  a  project  in  a  petrochemical  plant  in  Antwerp  has  started  in  which 
refinery  gases  are  treated  to  recover  valuable  hydrocarbons.  These  quantities 
are reported under LPG and reflect the increase observed for non-energy use in 
the petrochemical industry in 2018. 
The  decrease  of  fuel  oil  in  industry  consumption  since  1993  is  due  to  the 
introduction of an excise tax as well as increased use of natural gas. 
Natural gas 
General Notes 
In the 2022 edition, historical revisions were made back to 2013 due to better 
data availability and harmonisation with other gas data.  
Supply  
In  the  2022  edition,  a  sharp  increase  of  supply from  renewables  was  observed 
and  a  continued  increase  is  expected  as  more  injection  points  of  biomethane 
become active. 
The trade data from 2018 onwards include transit figures as a result of a change 
in methodology.  
Since 2009 gas trade in Belgium includes imported LNG which is regasified and 
subsequently exported to other countries. 
In  the  2019  edition,  the  LNG  consumption  data  in  international  marine  bunkers 
are confidential.

Transformation  
New  reporting  of  blast  furnaces  in  the  2022  edition,  this  is  linked  to  the  recent 
installation  of  a  DRI-plant  which  uses  natural  gas  to  replace  coal  for  the 
reduction of iron ore. 
The  Belgian  administration  is  in  the  process  of  revising  2010  and  2011 
transformation sector data. As such, an unusually high quantity of natural gas is 
reported under not elsewhere specified (transformation). 
Between  2008  and  2009,  there  is  a  break  in  efficiency  of  natural  gas 
autoproducer  CHP  plants  due  to  a  change  in  methodology  regarding  the 
reporting of unsold heat. 
Consumption 
In  2018  refinery  gas  started  being  further  purified  into  products,  leading  to  a 
higher consumption by oil refineries.  
Consumption  in  the  transport  equipment  sector  decreased  in  2015  due  to  the 
closure of a large industry of this sector in December 2014. 
In  2003,  the  large  decrease  in  non-specified  industry  consumption  is  due  to 
improvements in data collection. 
Since  2000,  natural  gas  began  to  replace  blast  furnace  gas  in  the  iron  and 
steel industry.  
Biofuels and waste  
General notes 
Renewable municipal waste includes a share of renewable industrial waste. 
Data for biodiesels and biogasoline are available starting in 2009. 
Supply  
Data on pure biogasoline and biodiesels trade are not available for 2009 and 
2010. 
Transformation 
In  2015,  part  of  the  law  regulating  the  blending  of  biodiesel  with  diesel  was 
temporarily suspended but in 2016, this law was reinstated.

Consumption  
Consumption  of  bioethanol  increased  in  2017  due  to  legislation  coming  into 
effect  on  1 January  2017,  which  increased  the  blending  obligation  for  gasoline 
products.  
Industrial waste consumption in the chemical sector started in 2011. 
Other liquid biofuels consumed in power plants reported before 2011 can include 
biodiesel. 
New data on consumption cause breaks in time series for primary solid biofuels 
between 2011 and 2012. 
Electricity and heat 
General notes 
In  the  2022  edition,  Belgium  revised  data  back  to  2014  due  to  improved  data 
availability, and improved natural gas data.  
In  the  2021  and  2020  editions,  Belgium  revised  data  back  to  2010  and  2014 
respectively.  
Supply  
For  2021p,  transmission  and  distribution  losses  of  heat  show  a  break  in-series 
compared  to  2020  values  due  to  the  implementation  of  a  new  methodology. 
Historical revisions are pending.  
In  2019,  the  increase  in  electricity  exports  is  mainly  due  to the  opening  of the 
NEMO-Link interconnector between Belgium and the United Kingdom. 
Electricity production from other sources mainly comprises production at a gas 
expansion station with heat recovery and at a hydraulic turbine in a waste water 
treatment plant. 
From 2013 onwards, reported heat distribution losses decreased due to a more 
precise estimation method. 
The production of electricity from wind is available from 1987.

Transformation  
In 2020 and 2018, electricity output from nuclear decreased due to outages at a 
number of reactors. 
Langerlo,  Belgium’s  last  coal-fired  main  activity  electricity  producer  closed 
permanently in March 2016. 
Heat  production  from  chemical  processes  used  for  electricity  production  is 
available from 2005. 
In 2012, heat production from chemical sources has been estimated by the IEA 
Secretariat. 
Offshore  wind  production  in  Belgium  commenced  in  2009.  Data  are  available 
from2010. 
Prior to 2009 some unsold heat was reported in natural gas autoproducer CHP 
plants,  together  with  the  associated  natural  gas  input.  This  causes  the  drop  in 
efficiency in 2009. 
In  2007  data,  no  information  was  available  on  heat  production  in  main  activity 
CHP plants for industrial waste. 
In  2003,  combustion  of  municipal  waste  for  electricity  and  heat  generation 
purposes  increased  significantly.  However,  because  a  large  portion  of  the  heat 
produced  is  not  used  (sold),  plant  efficiencies  dropped  significantly  between 
2002 and 2003. 
In  2000,  most  autoproducer  electricity  plants  using  combustible  fuels  were 
reclassified as autoproducer CHP plants; the heat production from these plants 
was used for internal industrial processes and not sold to third parties until 2005. 
For 1998 and 1999, electricity production at main activity producer CHP plants 
with  annual  heat  output  below  0.5  TJ  is  reported  with  main  activity  producer 
electricity only plants. 
Prior  to  1982,  electricity  production  in  main  activity  producer  CHP  plants  is 
included  in  production  from  electricity  plants.  Also,  inputs  of  fuels  for  electricity 
generation  in  main  activity  producer  electricity  plants  include  inputs  for  heat 
production in CHP plants.

Consumption 
For 2021p, the trend in heat consumption over 2020 is distorted somewhat due 
to the use of a new methodology used for transmission and distribution losses of 
heat in 2021 only. Historical revisions are pending. 
In  2018,  the  methodology  use  to  allocating  heat  consumption  between  the 
residential, commercial and public services, and agriculture and forestry sectors 
by one data provider was changed, resulting in some breaks in-series.  
Electricity  consumption  in  Road  includes  some  consumption  by  electricity 
vehicles  (EVs),  based  on  vehicles  numbers  distances  travelled.  However, 
coverage of hybrid vehicles varies across regions. In addition, not all charging is 
included.  Therefore,  some  consumption  by  EVs 
is  still 
included  under 
Residential. 
In  the  2019  edition,  revisions  were  implemented  for  the  direct  use  of  solar 
thermal in other sectors back to 2010 due to improved data availability. 
For 2012, electricity consumption in the mining and quarrying sector has been 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
For  2012,  oil refineries electricity  consumption has  been  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat  based  on  refinery  activity  data.  Part  of  the  estimated  amount  has 
been removed from consumption in the chemical and petrochemical sector. 
Breaks in time series may exist between 2007 and 2008 due to revisions of the 
Classification  of  the  Economic  Activities  in  the  European  Community  (NACE) 
classifications. 
There  is  no  heat  consumption  starting  in  2007  in  the  iron  and  steel  industry 
because  the  installation  concerned  became  an  autoproducer  in  July  2006  and 
the heat is no longer sold.

General notes 
In the 2018 edition, data for Canada were revised back to 2005 following a ten 
year revision of the Report on Energy Supply and Demand (RESD), the main set 
of  Canadian  annual  data.  The  revision  standardizes  the  methodology  used  for 
the  IEA  data  submission  and  has  mainly  affected  the  demand  side.  Additional 
details are given under each fuel. 
From the 2014 edition, the Canadian administration revised time series back to 
2005,  using  additional  data  from  the  Annual  Industrial  Consumption  of  Energy, 
the Annual Survey of Secondary Distributors, the Report on Energy Supply and 
Demand and the Natural Resources Canada Office of Energy Efficiency. Breaks 
in  time  series  also  between  appear  1989  and  1990,  due  to  changes  in 
methodology, incorporated in 2002. 
Coal  
General notes 
The 2022 edition includes revisions to coal production starting in 2015. 
The  2021  edition  includes  some revised  data  as  the methodology  implemented 
in the previous edition was further refined by the Canadian administration. 
The  2020  edition  includes  revisions  for  all  the  time  series  by  the  Canadian 
administration as more accurate data was available. 
Significant statistical differences can be observed for several coal products. This 
is under investigation and further improvements are expected in further editions. 
In the 2018 edition, data for Canada were revised back to 2005 following a ten 
year revision of the Report on Energy Supply and Demand (RESD), the main set 
of  Canadian  annual  data.  The  revision  standardizes  the  methodology  used  for

for several coal products for the period 2005-2015. In the 2016 and 2017 edition, 
extensive  revisions  for  the  period  2005  to  2015  were  received  as  more  data 
became available due to improvements in data collection. 
In  the  2014  and  2015  editions,  some  revisions  to  the  2004  to  2006  data  were 
received in addition to some time series and products for 2007 to 2011.  
From the 2014 edition, the Canadian administration revised time series back to 
2005,  using  additional  data  from  the  Annual  Industrial  Consumption  of  Energy, 
the Annual Survey of Secondary Distributors, the Report on Energy Supply and 
Demand and the Natural Resources Canada Office of Energy Efficiency. Breaks 
in  time  series  also  between  appear  1989  and  1990,  due  to  changes  in 
methodology, incorporated in 2002. 
Due  to  a  Canadian  confidentiality  law,  it  is  not  possible  for  the  Canadian 
administration  to  submit  disaggregated  time  series  for  all  of  the  coal  types. 
Between 2002 and 2006, the IEA Secretariat has estimated some of the missing 
time series. The data for 2007 onwards are given directly as reported, however 
data  may  be  present  in  non-representative  products,  and  additionally  these  ad 
hoc  reclassification  methodologies  contribute  significantly  to  larger  than  normal 
statistical differences across products. 
At  this  point  in  time,  oil  shale  and  oil  sands  data  are  not  submitted,  and  this 
energy  source  is  deemed  to  enter  the  supply  stream  as  shale  oil  (other 
hydrocarbons). 
Supply 
Due  to  confidentiality  constraints,  from  2014  the  breakdown  of  production  by 
type  of  coal  is  estimated  by  the  Canadian  administration,  while  stock  changes 
and statistical differences are estimated since 2001. 
Transformation  
In December 2018, Canada announced regulations to phase-out traditional coal-
fired electricity by 2030. 
Injection of pulverized coal into blast furnaces (PCI) occurs, but is not available 
for  confidentiality  reasons.  Coals  consumed  in  this  manner  are  reported  in  the 
iron and steel industry along with other consumption.

Before 1978, lignite inputs to main activity producer heat plants are included in 
final  consumption.  Starting  in  1979,  these  inputs  are  included  in  main  activity 
producer electricity plants. 
Consumption  
Data of consumption of anthracite in the iron & steel sector is confidential. The 
Canadian administration provides an estimate. 
Since  2001,  consumption  of  anthracite  in  non-energy  use  is  estimated  by  the 
Canadian administration.  
Due to the unavailability of data, non-energy use of coke oven coke and hard 
coal  is  included  with  final  consumption  sectors  prior  to  1978  and  1980, 
respectively.  
Oil 
General notes 
Several breaks in series appear between 2018 and 2019 due to the new Monthly 
Refined Petroleum Products survey launched by the Canadian administration in 
the  beginning  of  2019. The  survey,  redesigned to  better reflect the  evolution  of 
the refined petroleum industry, includes greater coverage of all products. 
The  2018  edition  includes  numerous  time  series  revisions  for  the  years  2005-
2016.  This  is  due  to  the  10  year  revision  of  the  Report  on  Energy  Supply  and 
Demand, which is the main set of Canadian annual data. The majority of these 
revisions were applied to the demand side. 
In  the  2016  edition,  the  Canadian  administration  was  able  to  reconcile  some 
historical  inconsistencies  by  reporting  inputs  and  outputs  to  upgraders.  In  the 
supply  side,  these  quantities  are  reported  under  other  hydrocarbons.  In  the 
demand  side,  they  are  reported  under  the  respective  output  products  (refinery 
gas, road diesel, and petroleum coke). 
Time  series  for  other  non-specified  oil  products  may  fluctuate  as  they  have 
been computed as residuals. 
Receipts  from  non-reporting  companies  are  currently  represented  in  the 
statistical  difference  flow,  work  is  ongoing  with  the  Canadian  administration  to 
address gaps in the coverage that lead to increasing statistical differences.

Supply  
In  the  2022  edition,  the  Canadian  administration  no  longer  reports  imports  of 
from  2019  onwards.  As 
these  amounts  refer 
to 
additives/oxygenates 
hydrocarbon-based  motor  gasoline  blending  components,  they  are  therefore 
included in the imports of this oil product. 
The  Sturgeon refinery  began  operations  in  late 2017. The  refinery  produced  its 
first diesel fuel in December 2017. It primarily processed synthetic crude oil but 
has successfully transitioned to bitumen.   
In  the  2018  edition  the  domestic  supply  of  crude  oil  was  revised  due  overall 
revisions  to  the  Report  on  Energy  Supply  and  Demand  and  the  inclusion  of 
additional data sources in the reporting. 
From 2014 data the Canadian administration started using customs based trade 
data to report crude oil imports. In the 2017 edition, crude oil imports data have 
been revised back to 2005 following this methodology. Some revisions to imports 
of  secondary  products  have  already  been  made  and  further  revisions  are 
expected. 
Condensates  and  pentanes  plus  are  included  in  crude  oil  from  2005,  in  NGL 
1990 to 2004 and in LPG prior to 1990. Historical revisions are pending. 
From  2005  primary  oil  products  include  direct  imports  of  condensates  by  crude 
oil producers. 
Production of other hydrocarbons represents synthetic crude oil produced from 
tar sands. 
From 2005, other hydrocarbons from other sources natural gas corresponds to 
natural  gas  used  for  the  upgrading  of  synthetic  crude  oil  (reported  under  GTL 
transformation  in  the  natural  gas  consumption  data)  and  natural  gas  used  to 
upgrade petroleum products (reported under non-specified transformation in the 
natural  gas  consumption  data).  Revisions  to  this  flow  were  introduced  in  the 
2019  edition.  From  1990  to  2005,  these  quantities  are  reported  in  indigenous 
production  of  other  hydrocarbons.  Prior  to  1990,  they  are  included  in  the 
natural gas supply. 
Imports  of  other  hydrocarbons  from  1994  to  2000  correspond  to  orimulsion 
imports from Venezuela. 
Refinery output from gas/diesel oil and petroleum coke includes output from oil 
sands and upgraders.

The  Canadian  administration  is  currently  unable  to  provide  a  figure  for  the 
domestic production of additives, but is working on solutions which will make this 
possible.  Meanwhile,  significant  statistical  differences  can  be  observed  for 
several secondary oil products. 
Consumption 
In 
the  2022  edition,  the  Canadian  administration  reports  refinery  gas, 
gas/diesel oil and petroleum coke consumption by crude bitumen upgraders in 
the oil/gas extraction sector from 2019 onwards. 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  Canadian  administration  provides  newly-available  data 
for petroleum coke consumption for energy-use in non-ferrous metals, chemical 
and  iron  and  steel  sectors  from  2019  onwards.  Prior  to  2019,  they  remain 
confidential. 
In the 2021 edition, the Canadian administration has moved the consumption of 
aviation  gasoline  from  commercial  and  public  services  to  domestic  aviation 
from  2013  onwards.  Similarly,  consumption  of  jet  kerosene  in  non-specified 
(industry) has been moved to domestic aviation from 2013 onwards. 
In 2019, the increase in refinery fuel use of refinery gas is due to the inclusion 
of  refinery  fuel  used  by  upgraders.  Prior  to  2019,  this  is  included  in  the  oil  and 
gas extraction sector. 
In the 2020 edition in order to increase consistency with IEA’s Energy Efficiency 
Indicators  methodology, 
the  Canadian  administration  has  moved 
the 
consumption of motor gasoline and gas/diesel oil from commercial and public 
in 
transport.  Moreover,  consumption  of 
services 
jet  kerosene 
to  road 
commercial and public services has been moved to domestic aviation. 
Due to confidentiality issues, consumption data for selected products and flows, 
such as fuel oil and gas/diesel consumption in iron and steel from 2009, are not 
available.  For  the  same  reason,  selected  products  may  include  estimates 
provided by the Canadian administration, such as Fuel Oil and Bitumen data for 
2014. 
In the 2019 edition the data series for consumption in oil and gas extraction was 
revised back to 2005 by the Canadian administration as new data sources meant 
a more accurate distribution between this sector and mining is now possible.  
International marine bunkers are included with inland waterways prior to 1978.

Natural gas  
General notes 
In  the  2019  edition,  the  Canadian  administration  proceeded  to  data  revisions 
from  2005  onwards  based  on  the  revised  source  statistics  from  Statistics 
Canada  and  with  the  aim  of  achieving  greater  consistency  with  the  Energy 
Efficiency Indicators data submission to IEA. 
Supply  
Indigenous production is measured by the Canadian administration by upscaling 
the marketable production by approximately 11% to account for own-use in the 
extraction process. 
Associated gas has been estimated by the Canadian administration for 2016 and 
2017. 
Non-associated  gas  production  data  include  colliery  gas  as  well  as  associated 
gas produced in Alberta. 
Transformation  
For  2000,  the  increase  in  main  activity  producer  electricity  is  due  to  new 
generation plants in Alberta and Ontario. 
Due  to  confidentiality  reasons,  the  Canadian  administration  estimated  natural 
gas consumption in oil refineries for the 2014-2017. 
Gas-to-liquids (transformation) represents quantities of natural gas consumed in 
the production of synthetic crude oil.  
Non-specified  transformation  represents  quantities  of  natural  gas  used  for  the 
upgrading of refined oil products. 
Consumption  
In the 2019 edition, the oil and gas extraction consumption was revised back to 
2005  in  order  to  more  accurately  separate  it  from  other  mining/extractive 
activities. 
In the 2019 edition, an improved methodology was applied to industry sector for 
2005 onwards resulting in a share of the not elsewhere specified (industry) being

allocated  to  various  industrial  sub-sectors  and  creating  breaks  between  2004 
and 2005. 
Starting  with  2014  data,  natural  gas  distribution  losses  will  no  longer  be 
reported by Canada as this flow was historically computed as a balancing variable. 
Due  to  confidentiality  reasons,  the  Canadian  administration  estimated  natural 
gas  consumption  in  the  following  sectors  for  2014-2017:  iron  and  steel,  non-
ferrous metal, transport equipment and machinery. 
For 2011, the increase consumption by non-metallic mineral production is due to 
switching from coal to natural gas in cement manufacturing. 
Prior  to  1990  data  for  consumption  of  natural  gas  for  construction  are  not 
available. 
Prior to 1978, consumption in non-specified industry includes gas used as fuel in 
oil refineries. 
Prior  to  1978,  agriculture  is  included  in  industry,  and  no  detailed  industry  sub-
sector data are available. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
In the 2022 edition, solid biofuels were significantly revised starting from 2016 due 
to  the  utilization  of  new  data  sources.  This  may  lead  to  data  breaks  in  the 
transformation sector between 2015 and 2016. 
 
The split of municipal waste reported assumes 65% renewable and 35% non-
renewable. 
The  IEA  Secretariat  has  estimated  the  data  for  biogases,  industrial  and 
municipal waste from 1990 to 2004, biogasoline (ethanol) from 1998 to 2004 
based on information supplied by Natural Resources Canada. 
Supply  
Canadian  biodiesel  production  increased  significantly  in  2014  because  a  large 
producer  came  online  at  the  end  of  2013.  In  2016  again,  there  was  a  big 
increase in production of biodiesel due to a large plant coming online in Alberta. 
This is also the reason for the increase in export, as Canada exports most of its 
biodiesel to the US.

Consumption  
In  the  2022  edition,  due  to the  utilisation  of  new  data  sources,  data  breaks  are 
visible between 2004 and 2005 for solid biofuels. 
Electricity and heat  
General notes 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  Canadian  administration  provided  revised  data  back  to 
2005  based  on  revised  methodologies  and  sectoral  alignments,  and  to 
incorporate additional data.  
In  previous  editions,  the  Canadian  administration  also  undertook  revisions  of 
many parts of the electricity time series back to 2005, based on the results of the 
Report  on  Energy  Supply  and  Demand  in  Canada  (RESD).  In  particular, 
revisions  were  made  on  the  inputs  and  outputs  of  power  plants  fuelled  by 
combustible  fuels  and  on  the  breakdown  of  final  electricity  consumption, 
resulting in possible breaks in time series.  
Supply  
In 2019, the Annapolis Royal tidal power station closed. 
In the 2018 edition, revisions were made to electricity production from wind back 
to 2013.  
For  2017  onwards,  fluctuations  in  electricity  output  from  nuclear  occur  in  part 
due  to  reactor  refurbishment  works.  Staggered  mainteance  across  various 
reactors is scheduled for Darlington (2017-2027) and Bruce (2020-2034) power 
generation stations.  
Discrepancies  occur  between  respective  reported  figures  for  electricity  trade 
between Canada and the US from 2016 onwards.  
Autoproducer  solar  PV  electricity  generation  is  available  from  2016.  Prior  to 
2016, data are included in main activity producers. As a result, a break in series 
occurs for main activity producer solar generation between 2015 and 2016.  
Starting  in  2009,  a  new  source  has  been  used  for  electricity  production  from 
solar, wind, and tide. This new source covers production from solar and wind 
only from plants with capacity higher than 500 kW.

Heat  production  includes  heat  produced  by  nuclear  power  stations  for 
distribution to other consumers up to 1997. 
Electricity  production  from  other  sources  mainly  refers  to  steam  and  waste 
heat. 
Transformation  
For  the  2022  edition,  the  Canadian  Administration  submitted  revised  data  for 
solid  biofuel,  due  to the  incorporation  of  data from  the  Industrial  Consumption 
of  Energy  survey  alongside  existing  data  from  the  Annual  Electric  Thermal 
Generating Stations survey. 
For  autoproducers  generating  electricity  with  process  steam  produced  from 
biofuels and waste, the energy required to produce the initial steam is not taken 
into account by the Canadian administration and as a result the efficiencies are 
overstated. 
In  the  2016  edition  of  this  publication,  there  was  a  reclassification  from 
autoproducer  to  main  activity  producer  for  plants  fuelled  by  biogases  and 
municipal waste. 
The  breakdown  of  electricity  and  heat  generation  between  natural  gas and  oil 
products  in  main  activity  producer  CHP  plants  has  been  estimated  by  the 
Canadian  administration  starting  in  1990.  This  may  cause  breaks  in  the  time 
series between 1989 and 1990. 
Net  electricity  production  by  autoproducers  prior  to  1990  includes  production 
from combustible fuel sources only. 
Inputs of fuels to heat plants are not available for 1979 to 1987. 
Consumption 
Electricity  consumption  in  road  refers  to  consumption  in  establishments 
primarily engaged in truck transport services; the operation of urban, interurban 
and rural transport systems; school buses; charter and sightseeing buses, taxis 
and limousine services. 
In  the  2020  edition,  data  for  several  sectors  were  revised  back  to  2005  to 
improve  accuracy  and  alignment  with  ISIC  classifications.  In  particular,  data 
previously  reported  under  “non-specified”  sectors  were  reallocated  to  specific 
sectors,  and  improvements  were  made  to  transmission  and  distribution  losses. 
As a result, some breaks may occur between 2004 and 2005.

In  2017,  the  decrease  in  electricity  consumption  in  the  chemicals  sector  is 
partially due to a large consumer having been rotated out of the source sample 
survey used to compile the data.  
Prior  to  2005,  transmission  and  distribution  losses  of  electricity  could  include 
statistical difference for certain years. 
Consumption of electricity in oil and gas extraction is not available prior to 1987. 
Consumption  of  electricity  in  coal  mines  is  not  available  between  1982  and 
1986. 
Breaks  in  the  time  series  occur  between  1973  and  1974  in  agriculture/forestry, 
and between 1987 and 1988 in the industry sector.

General notes 
Data are available starting in 1971. 
In  the  2017  edition,  data  for  2014  and  2015  were  revised  to  replace  figures 
previously estimated by the Secretariat. 
From 1990, consumption in paper and pulp includes forestry and consumption in 
agriculture is included in non-specified industry. In general, a new methodology 
has  been  applied  for  data  since  1990,  leading  to  other  breaks  in  time  series 
between 1989 and 1990. 
Coal  
General notes 
Other  bituminous coal  data  includes  sub-bituminous  coal for  all  years  up to 
2018, if present. 
Supply  
Stock  change  data  for  the  year  2020p  is  not  currently  available.  It  will  be 
completed in the next publication. 
Data for sub-bituminous coal is reported for the first time for the year 2020. 
In the 2021 edition, imports and consumption of anthracite are reported for the 
first time. The time series has been completed back to 2015. 
Consumption  
Since 1990, consumption in paper and pulp includes forestry and consumption in 
agriculture is included in non-specified industry. In general, a new methodology 
has been applied for data since 1990, leading to other breaks in series between 
1989 and 1990.

Oil 
General notes 
There  are  breaks  in  time  series  between  2008  and  2009  due  to  a  change  in 
methodology by the Chilean administration.  
Supply  
Receipts  from  other  sources  of  other  hydrocarbons  correspond  to  natural  gas 
used  in  refineries.  These  quantities  are  the  results  of  not-elsewhere  specified 
transformation in the Balances format. 
Consumption  
Starting  with  2017  reference  year  data  the  administration  can  now  identify 
consumption  in  construction  and  agriculture.  Prior  to  these  quantities  were 
reported under not elsewhere specified. 
Natural gas  
General notes 
The  2017  and  2018  values  for  not  elsewhere  specified  trans-formation  and  oil 
refineries have been estimated by the IEA secretariat. 
Supply  
Chile started reporting exports of natural gas with 2016 data. 
Data  representing  LPG  injected  into  the  natural  gas  distribution  network  are 
available starting in 2009. They are reported in from other sources - oil.  
Transformation  
For  2009  and  2010,  inputs  of  natural  gas  to  autoproducer  CHP  plants  were 
estimated  by  the  Chilean  administration.  For  other  years,  these  inputs  are 
included in autoproducer electricity consumption. 
Not  elsewhere  specified  transformation  represents  natural  gas  that  is  blended 
with refinery gas.

Consumption 
Natural  gas  used  for  oil  and  gas  extraction  is  included  in  gas  consumption  for 
energy use in oil refineries. 
Non-specified transport corresponds to marine transport. 
Biofuels and waste  
Supply  
Production  of  landfill  gas  ceased  from  2001  -  2014  as  landfill  sites  stopped 
producing adequate gas to continue collection. 
Transformation  
A new survey on primary solid biofuels causes breaks in production and input 
to autoproducer CHP between 2011 and 2012. 
Consumption  
Charcoal  production  and  consumption  have  been  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat  until  2013.  From  2014  data,  only  solid  biofuels  input  to  charcoal 
production plant is estimated. 
The  Chilean  administration  applied  a  new  revised  methodology  for  final 
consumption  of  primary  solid  biofuels.  This  may  lead  to  data  breaks  in  time 
series between 2013 and 2014. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply  
Electricity production from geothermal started at Cerro Pabellón in 2017.  
In 2014, the Chilean administration applied a new methodology in the reporting 
of  electricity  generation  from  solar  PV  and  wind,  resulting  in  breaks  in  time 
series between 2013 and 2014. Revisions for previous years are pending.  
The majority of electricity generation from other sources is from a conveyor belt 
transporting crushed rock from high altitude to lower altitude in a mine. A small 
amount from waste heat is also included.

Solar thermal heat production has been estimated by the IEA Secretariat using 
data published by Chilean ministry of energy. 
Heat production from solid biofuels and biogas use in Main CHP plants is not 
available. 
Electricity  production  from  autoproducer  hydro  is  self-declared,  and  as  such, 
subject to variation. 
Transformation  
For 2019, the increase in electricity output from natural gas and the decrease in 
output  from  coal  were  due  to  the  closure  of  some  coal-fired  power  plants,  and 
the resumption of natural gas imports from Argentina. 
For  2014,  data  on  inputs  to  transformation  processes  were  taken  from  the 
published energy balance, and the output was estimated based on the efficiency 
reported in previous years. 
Electricity production from other bituminous coal includes sub-bituminous coal.  
Production  of  chemical  heat  used  for  electricity  generation  started  in  2013. 
Besides chemical heat, data for heat production in CHP and heat plants are not 
available. 
Increases in electricity from natural gas in 2010 are due to the openings of new 
LNG terminals. 
The split of electricity generation by main activity and autoproducer by fuel was 
estimated by the Chilean administration for the period 1990 to 2003. 
The variability of electricity output from oil products is in part due to the fact that 
oil-fired power plants are used for backup generation.  
Consumption  
Consumption  in  agriculture/forestry,  and  construction  are  available  from  2017. 
For prior years, data are reported under Industry (non-specified). 
Electricity consumption in mining and quarrying includes: coal mining; industry 
(non-specified)  includes  food,  beverages,  and  tobacco;  and  wood  and  wood 
products; commercial and public services includes gas works.  
Increases  in  electricity  consumption  in  the  road  transport  sector  from  2014 
onwards are the result of a new estimation methodology, while electric vehicles

used for the transportation of ores are reported as consumption within the mining 
and quarrying industry. 
Disaggregated data on solar thermal consumption by sector are not available. 
Therefore, all consumption is allocated to the non-specified other sector. 
Prior to 2009, most statistical differences are included in distribution losses.

General notes 
Data for Colombia are available starting in 1971.  
Colombia  joined  the  OECD  in  April  2020.  Colombia  submitted  questionnaires 
with data for 2019 starting in 2021 edition. 
Historical  revisions  were  not  provided  and  some  breaks  in  the  time  series  can 
appear for 2018/2019.  
Due  to  the  new  questionnaire  layout  used,  minor  revisions  occurred  for  years 
1990-2018, leading to minor breaks in the time series for 1989/1990. 
In the 2020 edition, data for solar photovoltaic and biogas were added, based on 
new information from Unidad de Planeación Minero Energética (UPME) and the 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). 
In the 2020 edition, the oil balance was revised based on new information from 
UPME, Asociación Colombiana del Petróleo (ACP), Refinería de Cartagena and 
Ecopetrol.  Time  series  for  paraffin  waxes,  bitumen  and  lubricants  are  now 
available  from  1992  onwards.  Petroleum  coke  data  are  available  from  2016

onwards.  Data  for  non-specified  oil  products  are  partially  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat,  and  include  products  such  as  arotar,  slop,  sulphur  and  propylene. 
Naphtha  is  revised  from  2008  onwards  to  reflect  UPME  and  Ecopetrol 
information  on  exports  and  imports.  Transfers  of  naphtha  for  crude  oil  dilution 
are estimated by the IEA Secretariat. Crude oil stock changes and transfers are 
revised  from  2010  onwards,  as  well  as  2010-2013  supply  and  refinery  input  of 
crude oil to take into account the latest information from UPME.  
In the 2020 edition, the correction of discrepancies in biodiesel and ethanol data 
leads to revisions in biodiesel, ethanol, diesel and motor gasoline data from 2005 
onwards.  
In the 2018 edition, time series for the period 2013-2016 were revised based on 
new  energy  balances  received  from  UPME.  Breaks  in  time  series  may  occur 
between 2012 and 2013. 
Coal  
Supply 
Coking coal production was estimated by the IEA Secretariat for the data year 
2020.  
Consumption  
Data for non-energy use is not currently available. 
Oil 
General notes 
In the 2022 edition, data for Colombia prior to 1990 in the Oil Information may be 
different  from  those  in  World  Energy  Statistics  due  to  a  change  in  reporting 
methodology.  The  data  from  1990  onwards  reflect  the  conventions  and 
methodologies  of  the  IEA/Eurostat/UNECE  annual  oil  questionnaire.  As  such, 
there may be breaks between 1989 and 1990. 
In the 2021 edition, data for lubricants and paraffin wax are estimated by the 
IEA Secretariat.

Supply  
In  the  2022  edition,  the  Colombian  administration  reported  stock  changes  in 
2021p for several oil products. 
The  stock  change  of  crude  oil  in  2020  and  2021p  may  include  some  missing 
coverage in indigenous production. 
From  2010,  products  transferred  of  refinery  feedstocks  refer  to  naphtha 
blended with crude oil for dilution at refineries. 
Stock changes of some primary and secondary oil products are estimated by the 
IEA Secretariat. 
Consumption  
Consumption of jet kerosene for international aviation may include consumption 
for domestic aviation. 
Crude  oil  may  be  used  at  refineries  to  support  refinery  operations.  From  1990 
onwards, these are reflected in the statistical difference.  
Electricity and heat 
Supply  
Due to the lack of detailed electricity own use data, net electricity generation and 
electricity  own  use  by  source  have  been  estimated  based  on the  total  reported 
net-to-gross ratio for each year. Revisions are pending.  
Transformation  
Prior  to  2019,  inputs  of  residual  fuel  oil,  non-bio  gas/diesel  oil,  and  other 
kerosene to electricity generation are reported under the relevant fuel. However, 
the  associated  outputs  are  reported  in  aggregated  format  under  other  oil 
products. Historical revisions are pending.

General notes 
Data for Costa Rica are available starting in 1971.  
Costa Rica joined the OECD in May 2021. Costa Rica submitted questionnaires 
with data for 2020 starting in 2022 edition. 
In the 2022 edition, data were largely revised across all fuels for years 2016 to 
2019, leading to large breaks in 2015/2016. 
In  the  2020  edition,  due  to  clarification  given  by  Secretaría  Planificación  del 
Subsector Energía (SEPSE), data for coke oven coke were revised to zero and 
corresponding  figures  reported  as  petroleum  coke,  for  use  in  the  cement 
industry. 
In the  2020  edition,  crude  oil  transfers  and  stock  changes  are revised  between 
2013  and  2015  to  reflect  the  blending  of  remaining  crude  oil  inventories  with 
products after the closure of the refinery in 2011. As a result of this revision, NGL 
data  is  no  longer  reported.  Transfers  of  fuel  oil  to  gasoil  are  estimated  in  2016 
and 2017, while 2018 transfers data is reported by SEPSE. 
Data  previously  reported  in  non-specified  (other)  consumption  of  gasoil  is  now 
reported in the construction sector from 2005. 
In the 2019 edition, the IEA integrated revisions received from the country for the 
years 2006-2016. Most changes are for primary solid biofuels.

Coal 
General notes 
Other  bituminous  coal  and  anthracite  are  reported  together  until  2015  and 
separated from 2016. 
Oil  
Consumption 
In  the  2022  edition,  non-energy  consumption  of  bitumen  is  reported  in 
construction  for  the  time  series.  Previously,  they  were  reported  in  non-energy 
use in industry/transformation/energy. 
Biofuels and waste  
Transformation  
Solid  biofuels  CHP  auto-producers  are  classified  as  electricity  auto-producers 
before 2016. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply  
Due to the lack of detailed electricity own use data, net electricity generation and 
electricity  own  use  by  source  have  been  estimated  based  on the  total  reported 
net-to-gross ratio for each year. Revisions are pending.  
Transformation  
Prior to 2016, inputs of residual fuel oil and non-bio gas/diesel oil to electricity 
generation are reported under the relevant fuel. However, the associated outputs 
are reported in aggregated format under other oil products. Historical revisions 
are pending.

General notes 
Due to ongoing review of energy data for 2010-2014, revisions have been made 
in the 2017 edition. Full details are given under each fuel. 
Data are available starting in 1971. 
Coal  
General notes 
Other  bituminous  coal  data  include  sub-bituminous  coal  for  all  years,  if 
present.  
The use of gas works gas ceased in 2020. 
In  the  2022  edition,  calorific  values  were  revised  for  the  historical  time  series 
leading to revised  input to main electricity producer plants and TES. 
In  the  2018  edition,  data  for  the  Czech  Republic  were  revised  back  to  2010 
based  on  administrative  data  causing  breaks  in  time  series  between  2009  and 
2010. These revisions  impacted  mainly  industrial  consumption for  lignite,  BKB 
and other recovered gases. 
In the 2017 edition, coal consumption in the residential sector has been revised 
back  to  2010  due  to  a  new  survey  in  households  made  by  Czech  Statistical 
Office, creating breaks in time series between 2009 and 2010. 
Increased production and consumption of other recovered gases in 2014 is due 
to improved tracking of by-products from various transformation processes. Tail 
gases from the production of carbon black from coal tar are reported here, as are 
off gases from the manufacture and cleaning of syngas from lignite for an IGCC 
plant.  
Coal  which  had  been  previously  classified  as  sub-bituminous  coal  until  the 
2008 edition is now reported under lignite for all years.

Revisions  by  the  Czech  administration  have  resulted  in  some  breaks  in  time 
series between 2001 and 2002. 
Data  for  1990  to  1995  were  estimated  based  on  the  Czech  publication  Energy 
Economy Year Book. 
In 1995, town gas production (included in gas works gas) ceased. 
Since  2010  BKB  includes  multipurpose  brown  coal  dust  for  both  supply  and 
consumption. 
Supply  
In  the  2021  edition,  revisions  were  made  for  the  period  2010-2018  to  the 
consumption  of  other  bituminous  coal  and  lignite  in  Main  Activity  Producer 
CHP  Plants  and  Main  Activity  Producer  Electricity  Plants.  Only  the  structure 
changed,  the  total  did  not  change.  Revisions  were  also  made  to  the  calorific 
values of these products and flows for the same time period. 
Mining  in  Lazy  Mine  was  lowered  until  the  closure  of  the  mine  in  November 
2019. This shows in the decrease of production of coking coal. 
Imports  of  lignite for the  year  2019p  are  expected  to  be revised  upward  in  the 
next edition as more comprehensive data will be available. 
Other  recovered  gases  are  combustible  gases obtained  during the  production 
of gas works gas and as a result of chemical processes. 
Production from other sources of other bituminous coal is from coal slurries. 
A  portion  of  other  bituminous  coal  reported  under  from  other  sources  for  the 
period 2010-2015 correspond to reclassified coking coal.  
Statistical differences for coking coal for the period 2010-2015 are partly due to 
the reclassification of coking coal to other bituminous coal.  
Consumption  
In the 2019 edition, coke oven gas in energy own-use consumed by electricity, 
CHP and heat plants was revised for 2016 resulting in a break in the series. 
In the 2015 edition, improved reporting enabled revisions to be made for certain 
primary coal consumption flows between 2010 and 2012.

In  the  2014  edition,  residential  consumption  for  the  period  1990  through  2011 
was revised for other bituminous coal, lignite, coke oven coke and BKB, as 
more accurate consumption data became available. 
Due  to  economic  restructuring  in  consumption  in  the  late  1990s  (big  state 
enterprises subdividing and/or privatising and the utilisation of new technologies 
by businesses), there may be breaks in time series in these sectors. 
Oil  
General notes 
Data prior to 1994 are estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
In  2016  both  Czech  refineries  were  affected  by  accidents  which  resulted  in 
decreased refinery throughput, increased refinery losses and a large decrease in 
imports of crude oil offset by increased imports of finished products. The second 
accident affected the ethylene production unit and led to decreased activity in the 
petrochemical sector.  
In  2017,  the  units  previously  affected  by  accidents  were  upgraded  and 
operations resumed with increased output 
Transformation  
From  2002  data  onwards,  some  amounts  of  fuel  oil  have  been  reclassified 
under other products. This change mainly affects the transformation sector. 
Consumption  
Between 1998 and 1999, breaks in gas/diesel final consumption time series are 
the  Czech 
due 
to  a  new  data  management  system 
implemented  by 
administration. 
Natural gas  
General notes 
Between 1993 and 1994 there are some breaks in time series due to a change in 
the energy balance methodology between former Czechoslovakia and the Czech 
Republic.  Since  1993,  data  have  been  officially  submitted  by  the  Czech 
Statistical Office.

Supply  
From  2013  all  non-associated  gas  production  was  reclassified  as  colliery  gas 
production. 
Transformation  
In  the  2022  edition,  the  large  increase  in  inputs  for  electricity  generation  in 
autoproducers is due to the cessation of energy gas production (gas works gas) 
in one company and its replacement by natural gas. 
In 1996 natural gas inputs into gas works (transformation) ended. 
Consumption  
Prior to 1994 data in transport sector are for former Czechoslovakia. 
There  is  a  break  in  time  series  in  the  industry  and  transformation  sectors 
between 2009 and 2010 due to new available data from distribution companies. 
Starting  with  2008  data,  hydrogen  production  is  reported  in  chemical  and 
petrochemical  feedstocks  as  non-energy  use.  Up  to  2007,  chemical  and 
petrochemical consumption includes both energy and non-energy use. 
Biofuels and waste  
General notes 
The  restructuring  of  the  Czech  electricity  market  leads  to  breaks  in  the  time 
series in all sectors between 1998 and 1999. 
Data for municipal waste and solid biofuels are not available prior to 1990 and 
liquid biofuels data are not available prior to 1992. 
Supply 
The  increase  in  the  consumption  of  industrial  wastes  (non-renewable)  in  the 
non-metallic minerals sector in 2018 is related to increased demand from cement 
companies. 
Transformation 
For  2016  data,  an  increased  excise  duty  was  imposed  on  biofuels,  causing  a 
decline in consumption.

In  2016,  a  main  activity  producer  CHP  incineration  plant  fired  by  municipal 
waste was in test operation at Chotikov. 
Consumption  
In  the  2017  edition,  due  to  a  new  survey  in  households  made  by  the  Czech 
Statistical  Office  in  2015  (ENERGO  2015),  solid  biofuels  consumption  in 
residential sector has been considerably revised upwards since 1990. 
Hospital  waste  previously  reported  as  municipal  waste  is  reported  under 
industrial waste since 2008. 
New  survey  systems  cause  breaks  in  final  consumption  in  1999  and  in  2002. 
Breaks  in  both  supply  and  consumption  of  biofuels  and  waste  occur  again  in 
2003. 
Electricity and heat 
General notes 
In the 2021 edition, there were revisions for solar thermal from 2006 to 2018. 
In the 2017 edition, data for the Czech Republic were revised back to 2010 due 
to the  acquisition  of  new  administrative  data,  allowing  access to more  accurate 
and  detailed  data  sources.  As  a  result,  there  are  breaks  in  several  time  series 
between 2009 and 2010.  
Data  from  1990  onwards  have  been  officially  submitted  by  the  Czech 
administration. This may lead to breaks in time series between 1989 and 1990. 
Electricity  statistics  from  1971  to  1989  have  been  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat except for final consumption and trade which were submitted by the 
Czech administration. 
For  2017,  apparent  declines  in  autoproducer  heat  production  by  the  chemical 
and petrochemical sector, and in consumption by petroleum refineries, occur due 
to  the  incorporation  of  an  oil  refinery  into  a  neighbouring  petrochemical 
enterprise.  
Supply  
The amount of heat reported under other sources is primarily waste heat from 
the glass industry until 2009.

From  1999  onwards,  small  amounts  of  heat  have  been  exported  to  the  Slovak 
Republic. 
Transformation  
For  2020  data  onwards,  a  new  method  was  used  to  allocate  data  between 
electricity  only  and  CHP  plants.  This  result  in  some  breaks  between  2019  and 
2020. 
In the 2020 edition, a revision of the methodology for reporting the production of 
autoproducer  plants  running  on  combustible  fuels  removed  multiple  breaks  in 
time series between 2009 and 2010 for CHP and electricity-only plants that were 
introduced in the 2017 edition. 
For 2017, heat production from electric boilers and heat pumps is based on new 
survey  data,  whereas,  data  for  prior  years  have  been  estimated  by  the  Czech 
administration.  As  a  result,  some  breaks  in  series may  occur.  Historic  revisions 
are pending. 
Electricity  generated  from  waste  heat  in  CHP  plants  is  included  with  the  total 
production from combustible fuels. 
Data  on  heat  own  use  and  heat  imports  start  in  2010  and  2009  respectively, 
following extensive revisions by the Czech administration in the 2017 edition due 
to  the  acquisition  of  new  administrative  data.  Prior  to  this  period,  data  are  not 
available due to lack of sources. 
The production of electricity reported in the category other fuel sources refers 
to  electricity  produced  from  turbines  driven  by  the  mixture  of  air,  ammonia  and 
other non-coal gases derived from the petrochemical industry.  
From 2014, some autoproducer heat plants production figures became too small 
to appear in data collected. 
From  2012  data,  new  autoproducer  heat  plants  were  added  to  the  data 
collection, causing a break in time series. 
In 2012, a main activity producer electricity plant using solid biofuels started to 
produce also heat and was reclassified as main activity CHP plant. 
A different reporting methodology used by the Czech administration for biofuels 
and waste causes some breaks in time series between 2002 and 2003. 
In 1999 and 2000, various big enterprises have been divided, sold and merged. 
This causes breaks in the time series of all types of plants.

Industrial waste use in main activity producer electricity plants is included with 
solid biofuels from 1996. 
Data  on  biogases  and  waste  used  in  main  activity  producer  CHP  and 
autoproducer heat plants start in 1993. 
Prior  to  1990,  electricity  production  in  main  activity  producer  CHP  and 
autoproducer CHP plants is included in main activity producer electricity plants. 
Prior  to  1990,  heat  production  excludes  heat  sold  by  industry.  In  addition,  heat 
production prior to 1990 is reported under main activity heat plants because the 
breakdown by producer and plant type is not available before then. 
The  breakdown  of  net  electricity  production  by  source  is  not  available  prior  to 
1990. 
Data  on  heat  production,  and  the  corresponding  fuel  inputs,  have  been 
estimated  from  1980  to  1989  based  on  consumption  in  residential  and 
commercial/public services. Prior to that, inputs are included in industry. 
Consumption 
Data  on  electricity  consumption  by  cable  cars  (reported  under  non-specified 
transport) are available from 2017. 
Data for direct use of solar energy are available from 2003.

Denmark 
Source 
Danish Energy Agency, Copenhagen. 
General notes 
In the 2004 edition, major revisions were made by the Danish administration for 
the  1990  to  2001  data,  which  may  cause  breaks  in  time  series  between  1989 
and 1990. 
Coal  
General notes 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  historical  series  for  gas  works  gas  have  been  revised 
and set to 0 for all flows. After a revision of the definitions it was concluded that 
there is no gas works gas transformation taking place in Denmark. 
Supply 
Trade data for other bituminous coal might include transit trade. 
A  large  increase  of  steam  coal  imports  in  2003  was  related  to  a  drought  in 
Scandinavia.  Thermal  power  plants  were  operated  more  intensively  to  replace 
hydro-generated electricity that was consumed in the country. Additionally, more 
coal-generated  electricity  was  exported  to  other  countries  in  the  region. 
Significant  fluctuations  in  demand  are  also  evident  for  other  years  for  similar 
reasons, including 2006 and 2013, but exist to a lesser extent. 
Declines in stocks of steam coal stem from extensive deployment of renewable 
generation  technologies  and  policy  to  further  reduce  Denmark’s  utilisation  of 
coal-fired  power  and  implement  co-firing  with  renewable fuels  as  a  part of their 
Energy Strategy 2050.  
Oil  
General notes 
In  the  2020  edition,  as  a  result  of  resolved  confidentiality  issues,  biogasoline 
and biodiesel are reported separately from 2012 onwards.

Starting with 2013 data the Danish administration reports products transferred to 
refinery  feedstocks.  In  previous  years  refinery  output  is  reported  net  of  product 
transfers.  
Between 1995 and 2004, other hydrocarbon imports and inputs to main activity 
producer CHP plants represent orimulsion. 
From  1990  onwards,  Greenland  and  the  Danish  Faroes  are  not  included  in  the 
oil data. 
Information  on  waste  oil  recycling  and  final  consumption  begins  in  1989  and  is 
reported in other oil products. 
In 1988, consumption of gasoline type jet fuel ceased. 
As of 1987, separate data for paraffin waxes are no longer available. 
Prior to 1975, refinery gas is reported net of consumption in refineries. 
Supply 
Quantities of other hydrocarbons represent natural gas used by refineries.  
Transformation  
Due to improved survey methods, inputs to electricity and heat generation have 
been  reclassified,  causing  a  break  in  time  series  between  1993  and  1994. The 
oil  inputs  used  in  industrial  sub-sectors  for  producing  surplus  heat,  which  is 
delivered  to  district  heating  networks,  are  allocated  to  these  industrial  sub-
sectors. 
In  1994,  the  marked  increase  in  inputs  to  CHP  production  is  due  to  increased 
electricity exports to Norway. 
From  1974  to  1979,  consumption  of  fuel  oil  for  the  CHP  production  by 
autoproducers has been estimated. 
Consumption  
Consumption  data  are  based  on  a  detailed  survey  sent  to  companies  in 
Denmark  every  other  year.  For  non-survey  years,  the  consumption  figures  are 
estimated by the Danish Energy Agency 
White spirit and lubricants deliveries are estimated by Denmark. 
For 1994 and 1995, industry detail is based on a new survey.

Transformation  
In  the  2022  edition,  the  2020  figure  of  heat  generation  from  biogas  heat 
autoproducer plants has been estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
From 2012, biodiesel production is confidential and gathered with imports. 
Consumption  
In  the  2020  edition,  the  consumption  of  municipal  wastes  in  the  commercial 
and public services sector for 2017 data was revised. 
In  the  2016  edition,  the  Danish  administration  revised  energy  consumption  in 
industry  sectors  causing  some  breaks  in  solid  biofuels  consumption  between 
2010 and 2011. 
The  data  on  the  consumption  of  municipal  waste  in  the  industry  sector  are 
delayed  by  one  year  and  the  Danish  administration  duplicates  the  previous 
year’s data until the data become available. 
The  Danish  administration  estimates  the  growth  in  consumption  of  solid 
biofuels in the industry sector for the most recent year based on the growth in 
the transformation sector.

Electricity and heat  
General notes 
In the  2020  edition,  there  were  revisions from  2010  to  2017 for  solid  biofuels, 
biogases and solar thermal. 
Heat data are not available prior to 1976. 
Supply  
For  2019  data,  the  increase  in  heat  output  from  electric  boilers  and  heat 
pumps  was  due  to  the  opening  of  new  facilities.  This  also  contributed  to  an 
increase  in  the  coefficient  of  performance  for  heat  pumps  between  2018  and 
2019. 
In 2017, the declines in electricity and heat output from other bituminous coal 
and the corresponding increases in output from solid biofuels are attributable to 
fuel switching in co-fired plants. 
The  amount  of  heat  reported  under  other  sources  is  heat  recovered  from 
industrial processes and sold for district heating. 
Heat produced for sale by heat pumps starts in 1994. 
Geothermal and solar heat production for sale is available from 1989. 
From 1984 onwards, small amounts of heat have been imported from Germany. 
The production of electricity from wind is available from 1978. 
Transformation 
Fish  oil  used  in  main  activity  producer  heat  plants  is  included  with  solid 
biofuels. 
Due  to  the  high  number  of  heating  companies  burning  wood  chips  that  are 
equipped  with  boilers  with  flue-gas  condensation,  the  solid  biofuels  heat  plants 
show  a  high  efficiency.  The  efficiency  decline  evident  in  2016  was  due  to  two 
less efficient plants switching to biofuels. 
For some years, heat plants fired by natural gas, municipal waste, solid biofuels, 
biogases, and  other  oil products  show  efficiencies greater  than  100%,  on  a  net 
calorific  value  basis,  due  to  the  use  of  condensing  boilers  and  other  flue  gas 
condensation technologies that recover the latent heat of vaporisation. Inclusion

of small quantities of heat output from oil used alongside municipal waste in data 
for municipal waste may also affect efficiencies.  
Biodiesels  and  biogasoline  consumption  for  electricity  and  heat  production  are 
reported under other liquid biofuels, for confidentiality reasons. 
Data for other liquid biofuels main activity heat plants are available back to 1994. 
Consumption 
For  2020,  the  breakdown  of  electricity  and  heat  total  final  consumption  is 
estimated by the Danish administration based on 2019 data and will be revised 
in  the  following  reporting  cycle  once  their  new  industry  survey  results  are 
released. 
In  the  2016  edition,  the  Danish  administration  revised  electricity  and  heat 
consumption in the industry sector from 1990. 
Transmission and distribution losses of electricity are calculated as a residual. 
The direct use of solar thermal energy is available from 1978. 
Electricity  consumption  in  non-specified  industry  includes  consumption  in 
district heating plants and for the distribution of electricity.

Data for Estonia are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included in 
Former Soviet Union. 
Coal 
General notes 
Fuels  reported  as  coke  oven  gas  and  gas  works  gas  are  the  gaseous  by-
products  of  oil  shale  liquefaction.  Shale  oil  production  has  two  technologies: 
solid  heat  carrier  (SHC)  and  gas  generators  (GG).  SHC  output  byproduct  (in 
addition  to  oil  shale)  is  semi-coke  oven  gas,  which  is  categorized  under  coke 
oven  gas.  The  GG  byproducts  (in  addition  to  oil  shale,  fenols)  are  generator 
gas,  which  is  categorized  under  gas  work  gas  and  semi-coke,  which  is 
categorized  under  coke  oven  coke.  Inputs  of  oil  shale  to  “gas  works”,  “coke 
ovens”  and  for  “coal  liquefaction  plants”,  while  reported  separately,  combined, 
are  the  inputs  for  retorting  in  liquefaction  plants.  These  definitions  and 
classification  were  applied  to  all  the  time  series,  back  to  1990,  in  the  2022 
edition. 
In  2019,  the  production  and  consumption  of  oil  shale  decreased  significantly. 
This was due to two factors: CO2 and Russian electricity prices made the power 
generation  from  this  fuel  less  accessible  to  the  market;  and  at  the  same  time 
Estonia  was  developing a  strategy  to  reduce the  direct  burning  of oil  shale  into 
electricity. 
In  the  2013  edition,  data  for  oil  shale  production  for  the  period  1991  to  1997 
were  revised  to  match  Estonian  GHG  National  Inventory  values.  Consumption 
data remained unchanged. 
Supply 
Indigenous production of peat products stopped in 2017.

General notes 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  Estonian  administration  submitted  some  revisions  for 
residential  consumption  data  and  corrections  in  the  historical  time  series.  This 
affects gas/diesel oil, in particular. 
In  2012  data,  breaks  in  time  series  occur  for  trade  figures,  now  including  re-
exports, and for international bunkers.  
For  1990  to  2007,  oil  data  are  based  on  direct  communication  with  Statistics 
Estonia and UNECE. 
Natural gas  
Consumption 
Consumption  reported  under  not  elsewhere  specified  (Energy)  represents 
consumption of different activities of companies in the energy sector (NACE 35) 
for own uses without transformation. 
There  are  inconsistencies  in  the  time  series  for  residential  consumption  as  this 
sector is computed as a residual.  
In  2014  Estonia’s  main  company  in  the  chemical  and  petrochemical  sector 
ceased activity, resulting in no non-energy use of natural gas. 
In 2009 Estonia’s main producer of fertilisers ceased activity, resulting in a sharp 
decrease in the non-energy use of natural gas. The plant reopened in 2012. 
Biofuels and waste  
General notes 
In  the  2021  edition,  revisions  were  made  in  main  activity  producers  burning 
municipal wastes from 2015 to 2018.   
In  the  2021  edition,  revisions  were  made  in  electricity  plants  burning  solid 
biofuels in 2017 and 2018. 
In  the  2021  edition,  revisions  were  made  in  main  activity  producers  burning 
industrial waste (non-renewable) from 2016 to 2018.

World energy balances 2022 Edition 
 
In the 2021 edition, there were revisions in the non-metallic minerals sector from 
2015 to 2018 for industrial waste (non-renewable) and municipal wastes.  
In the 2021 edition, there was a revision in the wood and wood products sector 
for primary solid biofuels (excluding charcoal) in 2017.  
Data for biogases include landfill gas starting in 2005. 
Electricity and heat 
General notes 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  Estonian  Administration  revised  historical  data,  in 
particular, for oil shale, coke oven gas, and gas works gas, in order to better 
align  data  with  that  reported  by  companies  under  the  EU  Emissions  Trading 
System (ETS). 
Transformation 
In  2019,  electricity  output  from  oil  shale  decreased.  This  was  in  part  due  to 
higher carbon pricing, and the availability of low cost electricity imports. 
In  the  2020  and  2021  editions,  reporting  methodologies  were  aligned  with  the 
requirements  for  physical  energy  flow  accounts  (PEFA).  As  a  result,  some 
breaks 
in  series  occur  between  2015  and  2016. 
In  particular, 
for 
renewable municipal waste, coke oven gas, and industrial waste.  
Electricity output from solar is available from 2016. 
Fuels  reported  as  coke  oven  coke  and  gas  works  gas  are  the  solid  and 
gaseous  by-products  of  oil  shale  liquefaction,  and  main  activity  heat  and 
electricity  generation  from  these  fuels  is  tightly  associated  with  liquefaction 
plants. 
Inputs of fuel oil and gas works gas to transformation processes include shale 
oil. 
In  the  2018  edition,  the  surge  in  main  activity  heat  from  solid  biofuels  was 
related  to  reclassification  from  autoproducer  heat  plants,  where  previously 
autoproducer own use heat and associated fuel inputs are not reported, and the 
fuel consumption appears in the main economic activity of the autoproducer. 
From  1990  to  1999,  some  of  the  electricity  and  heat  production  are  reported 
under other oil products while the inputs are reported under the individual fuels.

General notes 
In 2014, a new survey system and a reclassification of the data lead to breaks in 
the time series between 1999 and 2000 for most products and sectors. The new 
survey  system  is  more  detailed  and  has  better  product  coverage,  especially  in 
electricity, CHP and heat production, as well as in industry. 
Coal 
General notes 
Coal  tar  used  for  non-energy  purposes  or  exported  is  not  reported  in  either 
production or consumption. 
In the 2015 edition, revisions were received for some consumption flows of other 
bituminous  coal  and  coke  oven  coke,  while  other  recovered  gases  (from 
ferrochromium  manufacture)  were  reported  separately  for  the  first  time,  with 
revisions back to 2000. Prior to 2000, off-gases from ferrochromium manufacture 
are  included  in  blast  furnace  gas,  and  inputs  of  coke  oven  coke  for 
ferrochromium  manufacture  in  inputs  to  blast  furnaces  instead  of  non-specified 
transformation. 
Prior to 2008, peat products are included with peat data. 
A  large  increase  of  steam  coal  imports  in  2003  is  related  to  a  drought  in 
Scandinavia.  Thermal  power  plants  were  operated  more  intensively  to  replace 
hydro-generated  electricity  that  is  consumed  in  the  country.  Additionally,  more 
coal-generated electricity was exported to other countries in the region.  
The  increase  of  other  bituminous  coal  inputs  into  main  activity  producer 
electricity plants from 1993 to 1994 was due to coal replacing imported electricity 
and hydro power.  
Production of gas works gas ceased in April 1994. 
Hard coal data prior to 1978 may include sub-bituminous coal.

Supply 
 
Peat products refer to peat briquettes and pellets, which were supplied from old 
stocks for 2019 and 2020. 
Transformation 
The  consumption  of  other  bituminous  coal  in  the  energy  sector  (own  use  in 
electricity,  CHP  and  heat  plants)  covers  the  use  of  coal  in  the  pilot  phase  of  a 
new power plant (the amount of coal was not used for producing any useful heat 
or electricity). 
In  2017,  the  consumption  of  coal  in  main  activity  producer  electricity  plants 
decreased  considerably  following  the  move  of  a  large  plant  to  the  national 
capacity reserve. 
The  significant  increases  and  decreases  of  other  bituminous  coal  inputs  into 
main  activity  producer  electricity  plants  from  year  to  year  are  due  to  coal 
replacing imported electricity and hydro power. 
Likewise,  peat  production  is  highly  dependent  upon  favourable  weather 
conditions  and  the  pricing  of  other  fuels.  The  decrease  in  peat  and  other 
bituminous  coal  usage  in  main  activity  electricity  plants  in  2008  was  due  to 
record electricity generation from hydro plants. A similar circumstance occurred 
in 2012. 
The  first  coking  plant  started  operation  in  1987,  hence  imports  of  coking  coal 
and production of coke oven coke and coke oven gas started in that year. 
Consumption 
Some  consumption  of  other  bituminous  coal  is  reported  for  the  first  time  in 
2019 as energy industry own use. This covers the use of coal in the pilot phase 
of a new power plant (the amount of coal was not used for producing any useful 
heat or electricity). 
Food,  tobacco  and  beverages  reports  1kt  consumption  of  coke  oven  coke  in 
2019  after  zero  in  2018.  This  is  due  to  rounding  (2018:  0,46 kt and  2019:  0,72 
kt).

Oil 
General notes 
The  2018  edition  includes  revisions  to  data  for  several  products  from  1999 
onwards.  
Several 
revisions 
to  petrochemical  data  were 
introduced, 
including  a 
reclassification  of  quantities  between  energy  and  non-energy  use.  Further 
revisions are pending.  
In  spring  2015,  the  Porvoo  refinery  had  the  largest  shut  down  in  its  history  for 
maintenance  works.  This  is  the  reason  for  the  large  decrease  in  refinery 
throughput in 2015. 
In 2014, the Finnish administration revised the time series for refinery gas from 
2000 and included flaring of petrochemical gases under distribution losses. 
Prior to  2002,  petroleum  coke  used  as refinery fuel  was  included  with  refinery 
gas. 
In 1995, there is a break in time series for oil products trade due to the aligning 
of the National Board of Customs trade data collection system with the European 
Union’s Intrastat system.  
Other hydrocarbons reported under from other sources natural gas correspond 
to  hydrogen  used  in  refineries,  also  represented  as  the  output  of  non-specified 
transformation in the balances format. 
Supply 
In 2021p, refinery output declined due to a 12-week maintenance outage. 
Consumption 
Data  on  non-energy  transformation  of  naphtha  in  the  petrochemical  sector  is 
now available from 1990 onwards. 
Due  to  a  new  calculation  model, there  is  a  break  in fuel  oil  other  consumption 
between 1998 and 1999.

Natural gas  
General notes 
Finland  imports  LNG  since  September  2016.  Before  2018  there  was  only  one 
company  operating  in  this  market,  LNG  supply  data  was  thus  confidential  and 
excluded from the supply side flows. 
Between 1999 and 2000 there are some breaks in the time series due to a new 
survey system and a reclassification of the data.  
Supply 
Data  for  international  marine  bunkers  consumption  started  being  reported  in 
2017. 
The  opening  and  closing  stock  levels  data  are  confidential  and  stock  changes 
data for 2017 are estimates by the Finnish administration. Transformation  
Non-specified  transformation  data  represent  natural  gas  used  for  hydrogen 
for  hydrodesulphurization  and 
is  used 
manufacture.  This  hydrogen 
hydrocracking in oil refineries  
Consumption 
Distribution losses include the quantities of boil-off natural gas originating from 
the natural evaporation of LNG in tanks. 
Not  elsewhere  specified  (transport)  includes  LNG  consumption  for  domestic 
navigation. 
Since  1995  data,  the  breakdown  between  residential  and  commercial/public 
services is available due to a new system of data collection.  
Prior  to  1989,  natural  gas  consumption  in  residential  and  agriculture/forestry 
had been estimated by the Finnish administration. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
Prior  to  2004,  industrial  waste  also  included  other  energy  forms  such  as 
hydrogen, heat from chemical processes, natural gas and blast furnace gas.  
Data for biogases and industrial waste are available from 1996.

Supply 
Due to confidentiality, the biodiesel production includes trade figures and stock 
changes  starting  with  2015  data.  Biogasoline  import  for  the  same  time  period 
covers production, exports and stock changes. 
 
In the 2022 final edition, the administration changed the methodology to estimate 
primary solid biofuels trade data for 2021p. For this reason, a break in the time 
series  appears  between  2020  and  2021p.  In  future  editions,  the  administration 
will revise historical data. 
Transformation 
The use of charcoal in blast furnaces started in 2018 on a test basis. 
The amount of biodiesel used for blending with diesel fell greatly in 2016 after 
record  levels  for  the  past  two  years.  Annual  variation  in  the  consumption  of 
biofuels  is  possible  and  caused  by  Finland’s  biofuel  legislation,  which  gives 
distributors the possibility to fulfil the bio obligation flexibly in advance. 
Consumption 
Starting  in  2017,  the  large  increase  of  biogas  consumption  in  the  paper,  pulp 
and  printing  industry  is  due  to  a  change  in  process  in  the  industry.  Wood  was 
gasified and replaced natural gas or oil. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply 
Electricity  production  in  Finland  is  affected  by  connection  to  the  Nord Pool 
power  exchange.  In  periods  of  high  rainfall,  it  is  more  economic  to  import 
electricity  from  other  Nordic  countries  than  to  produce  it.  Therefore,  production 
and trade are subject to variability. 
Other  sources  include  hydrogen,  purchased  steam,  and  heat  recovered  from 
flue gas scrubbers. For 2017, the increase in heat production from other sources 
is  due  to  the  reporting  of  heat  recovered  from  flue  gas  scrubbers  for  the  first 
time. 
The  increasing  heat  production  from  heat  pumps  in  2007  and  2008  is  from  the 
new Katri Vala district heating and cooling plant.

Heat  from  chemical  processes  and  associated  electricity  generation  are 
available from 2000. 
Transformation  
Electricity plants data may include some CHP plants operating in electricity-only 
mode.  Likewise,  heat  plants  data  may  include  some  CHP  plants  operating  in 
heat-only mode. 
In the 2017 edition, fuel inputs and heat production from peat main activity heat 
plants  have  been  revised  since  2000  as  new  data  became  available  for  small 
peat heat plant units.  
In  the  2016  edition,  the  allocation  of  solar  photovoltaic  between  main  activity 
and autoproducer plants was revised. 
From  2014  data,  an  autoproducer  in  the field  of  iron  and steel  industry running 
on coke oven gases and blast furnace gases was sold and is now reported as 
main-activity producer. 
The  increase  in  heat  production  from  municipal  waste  in  2014  is  due  to  the 
opening of a new plant. 
In 2014, the new consumption of other liquid biofuels in main activity electricity 
plant corresponds to biopyrolysis oil made from wood chips. 
Data on peat products electricity and heat generation are available since 2008. 
Prior to that, they are included in peat. 
Heat output from autoproducer CHP plants is available starting in 1996 and from 
autoproducer  heat  plants  starting  in  2000;  corresponding  inputs  may  be  under-
reported. 
Before 1999, all electricity production from autoproducers running on fuelwood 
is allocated to CHP plants. 
Electricity and heat production from biogases are available from 1996. 
Prior  to  1992,  outputs from the  use  of  combustible  renewables  and waste to 
generate  electricity  and/or  heat  were  included  in  peat.  Therefore,  the  IEA 
Secretariat estimated the breakdown of outputs from municipal waste and solid 
biofuels based on reported inputs.

Inputs of liquid fuels and natural gas to CHP plants are included with the inputs 
of these fuels to main activity producer electricity only and heat only plants prior 
to 1978. 
Electricity  production  from  biofuels  and  waste  is  not  available  between  1974 
and 1976. 
Consumption 
Electricity  consumption  in  road  is  based  on  estimates  by  the  Finnish  VTT 
research  centre,  and  includes  all  electricity  consumption  by  electric  vehicles, 
both 100% electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. 
In the 2017 edition and following, an extended review of NACE sector encoding 
by  the  Finnish  administration  resulted  in  the  revision  of  the  sectoral  heat 
consumption time series back to 2007, leading to breaks in time series between 
2006 and 2007 in some heat consumption sectors.  
In  2016,  the  production  of  heat  by  autoproducers  in  the  oil  refineries  sector 
ceased, following a change of ownership of some plants and their reclassification 
as  main  activity  producers.  This  reclassification  also  resulted  in  an  increase  in 
reported  heat  consumption  by  oil  refineries,  as  heat  previously  produced  and 
consumed by oil refineries is now purchased.  
Between  2013  and  2014,  heat  consumption  in  the  paper,  pulp  and  printing 
sector  shows  an  apparent  decline  because  a  power  plant  came  under  the 
ownership of a paper and pulp company. 
A  new  survey  of  the  agriculture  and  forestry  sector  leads  to  breaks  in  the 
electricity consumption between 2007 and 2008. 
The  split  of  heat  consumption  in  the  different  industry  sectors  is  available 
starting from 2007. Prior to that, it is aggregated in non-specified industry. 
Prior  to  2000,  consumption  of  heat  in  consumption  in  agriculture/forestry  and 
commercial/public services is included under industry non-specified. 
Consumption  of  electricity  in  the  industry  sub-sector  machinery  includes 
consumption in transport equipment prior to 1995.

General notes 
In the 2018 edition, data for France were revised back to 2011 following changes 
in  methodology  and  procedures  used  by  the  energy  statistics  sub-department 
(SDSE) within the Ministry for the ecological and inclusive transition. As a result, 
the revisions, to bring the reporting more in line with the international standards, 
impacted all fuels. Additional details are given under each fuel. 
From  2012,  the  energy  consumption  is  more  detailed  due  to  a  more  precise 
national survey. 
From  2011  data  onwards,  France  now  includes  Monaco,  and  the  following 
overseas  departments  (Guadeloupe;  French  Guiana;  Martinique;  Mayotte;  and 
Réunion);  and  excludes  the  overseas  collectivities  (New  Caledonia;  French 
Polynesia; Saint Barthélemy; Saint Martin; Saint Pierre and Miquelon; and Wallis 
and Futuna). 
Coal 
General notes  
Due  to  confidentiality  reasons,  some  demand  flows  have  been  merged  for  the 
products  other  bituminous  coal  and  anthracite,  starting  in  2020.  Those 
aggregations are: paper, pulp and printing, food, beverage and tobacco, and not 
elsewhere  specified  (industry);  machinery,  non  ferrous  metals  and  non-metallic 
minerals. 
Due  to  confidentiality  reasons,  some  demand  flows  have  been  merged  for  the 
products lignite and BKB, starting in 2020. The flows merged are iron & steel, 
chamical and petrochemical, non ferrous metals and non metallic minerals. 
Due to confidentiality reasons, the flows iron and steels and non ferrous metals 
have been merged for coke oven coke, starting in 2020. 
Due to confidentiality reasons, blast furnace gas includes blast furnaces gas, 
coke  oven  gas  and  other  recovered  gases  from  2018  onwards.  This

aggregation may lead to unusual figures and efficiencies in the energy balance 
and CO2 emissions. 
The losses of blast furnace gas, coke oven gas and other recovered gases 
are  included  under  statistical  difference  until  2016.  From  2017  onwards  these 
losses are reported under “other energy uses”. 
In 2018 edition, the calorific value of coking coal has been revised in agreement 
with Eurostat and the IEA. The revision was made for the period 1990 to 2016.  
In  the  2017  edition,  the  French  administration  undertook  comprehensive 
revisions  on  sectoral  coal  consumption  back  to  2011.  Starting  this  edition,  new 
information became available for anthracite, BKB and other recovered gases.  
From  2012,  the  energy  consumption  is  more  detailed  due  to  a  more  precise 
national survey. 
Prior  to  2011,  other  manufactured  gases  (oxygen  steel  furnace  gas)  are 
included in blast furnace gas. 
For 1989 to 1998, the IEA Secretariat has estimated industry consumption based 
on Consommations d’Energie dans l‘Industrie, SESSI. 
Prior to 1985, consumption of colliery gas is included with the use of coke oven 
gas by autoproducers.  
Hard coal data prior to 1978 may include sub-bituminous coal. 
Supply 
For  the  year  2021E  the  production  of  coke  oven  coke  has  been  merged  with 
stock change due to confidentiallity reasons. 
Transformation 
In the 2021 edition, revisions were made on the split of other bituminous coal 
between  Main  Activity  Producer  Electricity  Plants  and  Main  Activity  Producer 
CHP Plants for the period 2011-2018. 
In  the  2021  edition,  following  a  methodological  change,  a  power  plant  was 
reallocated from main activity producer to autoproducer. Hence, there is no more 
figure  for  other  manufactured  gases  in  the  first.  This  was  done  for  2018  and 
2019.

In  2017  the  use  of  other  bituminous  coal  into  transformation  for  electricity 
increased by more than 20% to compensate lower generation from nuclear and 
hydro plants. 
In 2016 the company that consumed blast furnace gas for electricity and heat 
generation ceased its activity. 
Consumption  
In  the  2018  edition,  the  split  of  energy  consumption  between  the  residential 
sector  and  the  commerce  and  public  services  sector  has  been  revised  back  to 
1990  by  the  French  administration  for  other  bituminous  coal,  lignite,  coke 
oven coke, BKB and patent fuel. 
Blast  furnace  gas  and  coke  oven  gas  used  for  energy  purposes  in  blast 
furnaces are no longer reported under the iron and steel industry. As of the 2018 
edition these quantities are reported under the energy sector. 
Final consumption in industry is estimated by the Secretariat from 1986 to 2001 
for some products. 
Oil 
General notes 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  French  administration  revised  the  deliveries  of 
gas/diesel oil and fuel oil for international marine bunkers and consumption in 
domestic navigation from 2011 onwards as a result of a change in methodology 
and improved data for the overseas territories.  
Statistical differences observed for motor gasoline and naphtha are partly due to the 
absence of a specific naphtha category in the customs classification. 
Statistical differences appear for other products as a result of different definitions 
used  for  this  residual  category  between  the  customs,  refineries,  power  plants 
and petrochemical industry.  
From  2013,  information  is  available  for  imports  of  condensates  used  by  the 
petrochemical  sector.  These  are  reported  under  imports  of  NGL,  interproduct 
transfers of NGL to other oil products, and consumption of other products. 
From 1991, additives and oxygenates data are available.

Supply 
Due to classification issues noted by the French administration, there is a large 
statistical difference for other kerosene in 2020. 
Breaks  in  trade  and  transfers  of  refinery  feedstocks,  naphtha,  gas/diesel  oil 
and fuel oil occur in 2020 due to new reallocation following customs information 
obtained by the French administration. 
The  decrease  in  output  of  naphtha  in  2019  is  due  to  refinery  maintenance 
shutdowns,  particularly  of  the  Grandpuits  refinery  with  the  drilling  of  the  Ile-de-
France pipeline (PLIF). 
Higher than usual seasonal maintenance in the spring of 2018 impacted refinery 
intake and output.  
From  2009,  transfers  of  kerosene  type  jet  fuel  to  white  spirit  correspond  to 
kerosene used as a base for making white spirit.  
From  2008  data,  refinery  intake  of  refinery  feedstock  and  refinery  output  of 
refinery  gas  output  figures  exclude  natural  gas  used  in  the  steam  reformer  of 
the Gonfreville refinery. 
From 2008 data, ethane refinery output is reported 
From 2002 data onwards, ethylene produced in Lacq is not included in NGL.  
From  1998  data,  a  different  treatment  of  transfers  was  adopted.  Imported  oil 
products needing further refinery processing are no longer reported as refinery 
feedstock imports but as oil product imports and products transferred. Fuel oil 
includes  part  of  the  amounts  previously  reported  in  other  oil  products  from 
1999 and various other products from 2001. 
Transformation 
Starting in 2012, separate data on main activity heat plants inputs are available. 
Consumption  
In  the  2021  edition,  the  French  administration  revised  the  consumption  split  of 
kerosene  type  jet  fuel  between  international  and  domestic  aviation  from  2011 
onwards, taking into account non-commercial flights and resulting in an increase 
in the consumption share for domestic aviation.

World energy balances 2022 Edition 
 
From  2018,  due  to  a  reclassification  of  a  power  plant  from  the  main  electricity 
production sector to the chemicals sector, a decrease in inputs of refinery gas 
for main activity plants for CHP production is observed and complemented by an 
increase in its consumption for energy use in the chemical sector.  
From  2018,  consumption  of  gas/diesel  oil  in  bakeries  is  reported  in  food, 
beverage  and  tobacco.  In  previous  years,  this  consumption  is  included  in 
commercial and public services. 
In 2018, there is a decrease in deliveries to the petrochemical sector due to plant 
shutdowns for maintenance.  
The breakdown between international and domestic marine bunkers is estimated 
by the French administration.  
Between 2005 and 2006, a break is visible in LPG time series, as consumption 
from  one  chemical  company  was  re-classified  from  energy  use  to  non-energy 
use.  Breaks  in  LPG  time  series  also  appear  in  2001  due  to  improved  data 
collection.  
From  2000  data,  petroleum  coke  consumption  in  the  non-ferrous  metals 
industry is no longer available separately. Prior to 1982, no breakdown between 
energy and non-energy use is available for this product. 
From  1998  data,  military  consumption  of  kerosene  type  jet  fuel  is  reported 
separately from domestic aviation. 
Prior to 1988, LPG includes ethane consumption. 
Prior  to  1985,  the  residential  sector  consumption  of  gas/diesel  oil  is  reported 
under the commerce/public services sector, as no separate data were available. 
Natural gas  
General notes 
Starting 
from 
the  2018  edition, 
the  French  administration  revised 
the 
methodology  used  in  the  2018  edition  to  bring  it  more  in  line  with  the 
international standards. More specifically, (i) Supply figures were revised for the 
period  2007-2016,  (ii) transformation  sector  consumption  for  2007-2016,  (iii) 
energy  sector  consumption  for  2011-2016,  (iv)  transport  and  commercial/public 
services  for  2000-2016,  (v) industry  sector  for  2011-2016  and  (vi)  imports  and 
exports for 2011-2016.

In  the  2019  edition,  the  French  administration  revised  the  demand  side  from 
2011 onwards by improving the methodology with the consolidation of data from 
SDSE  surveys  and  additional  official  sources.  In  the  2022  edition,  inland 
consumption was updated using the same methodology. 
Until  2007,  some  statistical  differences  reported  by  the  French  utilities  were 
included  in  distribution  losses.  Since  2008,  these  amounts  are  included  under 
statistical differences. 
Between  1999  and  2000,  there  are  some  breaks  in  time  series  due  to  a  new 
methodology for preparing the natural gas balances. 
The  data  include  the  French  overseas  departments,  however  natural  gas  is 
neither produced, nor consumed in these departments. 
Supply  
The total imports and exports data include transit amounts.  
From 1990 to 1998, statistical difference includes gas consumption which is not 
broken down by sector. 
Consumption  
In the 2020 edition, commercial and public services, and residential was revised 
from 1990 to 1999 due to new data becoming available. 
The  increase  in  natural  gas  consumption  in  the  electricity  sector  for  2016  and 
2017  has  been  mainly  driven  by  the  decrease  in  nuclear  generation  due  to 
maintenance operations, which was compensated by gas-fired power plants.Gas 
for pipelines is included in distribution losses.  
Between 2005 and 2006, there is a break in the time series of the industry sub-
sectors. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
In the 2018 edition, following an analysis of biogases in the energy sector by the 
French  administration,  there  are  revisions  in  biogas  indigenous  production, 
inputs to the transformation sector, heat production and final consumption back 
to  2005.  Electricity  production  from  biogases  is  revised  back  to  2011.  This 
causes breaks in time series between 2004 and 2005 as well as 2010 and 2011.

World energy balances 2022 Edition 
 
Indigenous production, transformation and final consumption of industrial waste 
are  reported  from  2013.  In  the  2018  edition,  indigenous  production  and 
transformation  of  industrial  waste  were  added  from  2007  -  2012.  It  follows  that 
there is a break in time series between 2012 and 2013. 
In  the  2018  edition,  solid  biofuels’  indigenous  production  and  inputs  to  main 
activity and autoproducer heat plants have been revised back to 2007 Electricity 
production  has  been  revised  back  to  2013.  This  causes  breaks  in  time  series 
between 2006 and 2007 as well as 2012 and 2013. 
In the 2018 edition, indigenous production and inputs to main activity heat plants 
have  been  revised  back  to  2007 for municipal  waste.  Electricity  production  has 
been revised back to 2011. This causes breaks in time series between 2006 and 
2007 as well as 2010 and 2011. 
Prior  to  2007,  production  and  consumption  of  industrial  waste  were  included  in 
municipal waste. 
Transformation 
Plants  using  municipal  waste  were  reclassified  as  autoproducer  CHP  plants 
from 1995, which leads to a break in time series.  
Breaks  in  time  series  in  2005  for  municipal  waste  and  solid  biofuels  are 
caused by sectoral reclassifications. 
Consumption 
A revision of the solid biofuels and biogases time series created breaks in the 
direct use time series between 2004 and 2005. 
The breakdown of the final energy consumption of biogases was estimated by 
the French administration from 1970 to 2003. 
Electricity and heat  
Supply  
In  the  2019  edition,  heat  supply  and  consumption  data  were  revised  due  to 
improved information on heat production from renewables. 
All  solar  photovoltaic  plants  with  capacity  above  1 MWp  are  considered  as 
main  activity  producers,  while  all  plants  with  capacity  below  that  value  are 
considered autoproducers.

Electricity  production 
from  other  sources 
is  available  starting 
in  2007, 
representing  production  of  electricity  from  purchased  steam,  and  from  2018, 
hydrogen. The input is shown under non-specified transformation. 
Data on electricity production from wind are available from 1990. 
Transformation 
In  the  2021  edition,  some  main  activity  producers  were  reclassified  as 
autoproducers. 
For  2018,  inputs  and  outputs  of  coke  oven  gas,  and  other  recovered  gases 
are included under blast furnace gas for confidentially purposes. 
The  methodology  for  reporting  inputs  to  CHP  plants  is  under  currently  under 
review by the French administration and historical revisions are expected.  
For  the  2018  edition,  revisions  for  heat  production  in  all  plant  types  were 
received and accepted for many fuels from 2007 onwards, with the exception of 
natural  gas,  where  the  planned  revisions  for  2007  and  2008  are  still  pending 
implementation by the Secretariat.  
In  the  2018  edition,  electricity  production  from  hydro  was  revised  back  to  the 
year 2000, in some cases only amounting to plant reclassification. 
Electricity  production  from  the  Bouillante  geothermal  main  electricity  plant  in 
Guadeloupe  is  included  from  2011  onwards,  when  data  coverage for  France  is 
extended  to  include  the  overseas  departments.  Electricity  production  from 
autoproducer  geothermal  started  in  2011  and  stopped  in  2012  due  to  the 
maintenance of the only plant. This production restarted in 2016.  
The  amount  of  heat  not  sold  in  autoproducer  plants  is  included  in  total  heat 
production up to 2007. 
In 2005, autoproducer CHP efficiencies for biogases drop due to the opening of 
a larger, less efficient plant. 
From  2000  several  plants  have  been  reclassified  from  electricity  only  to  CHP 
plants. This causes breaks in the time series between 1999 and 2000. 
Prior  to  2000,  inputs  and  outputs  of  oil  products  are  not  available  separately 
and are reported together under other oil products. From 2000 to 2008, there 
are  further  classification  problems  for  inputs  and  outputs  of  electricity  and  heat 
from  oil  products.  The  French  administration  is  working  to  reconcile  their  data 
collection methods for the inputs and the outputs for electricity generation.

A  new  method  of  survey  and  a  reclassification  between  main  activity  producer 
electricity  plants  and  autoproducer  electricity  plants  may  cause  breaks  in  the 
time series for other bituminous coal between 1998 and 1999. 
There  was  re-classification  on  autoproducer  plants  using  municipal  waste  in 
1995, which leads to a break in the time series.  
Net electricity production by autoproducer CHP plants is available from 1989. 
Net  electricity  production  by  autoproducers  prior  to  1983  includes  production 
from combustible fuel sources only. 
Consumption  
In the 2021 edition, data were revised back to 2011 by the French administration 
to replace data from statistical surveys with new administrative data.  
In the 2019 edition, revisions for 2011 onwards were received for all electricity 
consumption  flows,  based  on  a  correction  to  a  survey.  This  has  introduced  a 
wider statistical difference than previously published, and is under review. 
In the 2018 edition, revisions for 2011 onwards were received for all electricity 
consumption flows, based on an improved survey. This has led to breaks in time 
series between 2010 and 2011. Similarly, heat consumption from 2007 onwards 
was  revised  to  account for  autoproducer  own  use  heat generation  in  its correct 
economic activity. 
In  the  2017  edition,  the  French  administration  undertook  comprehensive 
revisions  on  sectoral  electricity  consumption  time  series,  for  some  sectors 
revising  back  to  1990.  Electricity  consumption  at  railway  and  bus  stations, 
shipping piers and airports is no longer included in the transport sector but in the 
commercial  and  public  services  sector.  Road  electricity  consumption  has  also 
been  revised  back  to  1990,  following  an  extended  review  of  NACE  sector 
encoding by the administration. These revisions created breaks in time series for 
several  sectors,  which  the  administration  anticipates  to  address  in  subsequent 
reporting cycles.  
For  the  2014  edition  of  this  publication,  the  French  administration  revised 
electricity consumption data in the agriculture and forestry sector back to 2004, 
resulting in breaks in time series. 
Electricity  consumption  in  Road  includes  consumption  by  100%  electric 
vehicles.  These  amounts  are  estimated  by  the French  Administration  based  on 
vehicle  numbers,  and  expected  electricity  usage.  Consumption 
includes

domestic  charging  -  however,  these  amounts  are  currently  subtracted  from 
non-specified transport, rather than residential consumption. 
Consumption  of  electricity  in  uranium  treatment  plants  is  confidential  for  the 
period 2003 through 2010, and unavailable prior to 1980. 
Data on transmission and distribution losses for heat are available only starting 
from 2007. Prior to that, they were included in final consumption. 
Prior to 2005, all the geothermal heat consumption was reported as direct use. 
From 2005 data, some quantities are reported as output of heat plants, resulting 
in breaks in time series for production, transformation and consumption. 
Electricity consumption in non-specified transport refers to ski lifts. 
Prior to 2011, electricity consumption in (sub)-urban and national rail is based on 
high  voltage  electricity  supply 
to 
the  rail  sector.  From  2011  onwards, 
consumption in (sub)-urban rail is based on electricity used for propulsion by the 
main operator, and estimates for the other operators. 
Consumption  of  electricity  for  oil  and  gas  extraction  includes  that  used  in  oil 
refineries from 1988 to 2000. 
Non-specified other consumption includes exports to Monaco prior to 1992 and 
defence-related activities, among others. 
The industry classifications used by the French administration were changed in 
1986. 
There  are  major  breaks  in  the  time  series  in  1965  when  more  detailed 
breakdown of data on electricity consumption became available.

Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, Berlin. 
General notes 
Data  starts  in  1960.  German  data  include  the  new  federal  states  of  Germany 
from 1970 onwards. 
Coal  
General notes 
Comprehensive  official  data  are  only  collected  for  the  aggregate  of  hard  coal. 
Due to the unavailability of detailed data, the split into anthracite, coking coal 
and other bituminous coal is partly estimated by the national administration. 
In  the  2014  edition,  significant  revisions  were  submitted  for  all  primary  coal 
types, derived products and manufactured gases for the period 2003 to 2011 as 
previous  estimations  were  updated  with  more  accurate  information.  Revisions 
primarily  affected  consumption,  including  industry  and  other  sectors;  but  also 
supply, statistical differences and weighted calorific values. 
Up to 2002, other bituminous coal includes anthracite. 
Between  1998  and  2005,  breaks  in  time  series  may  occur  for  coke  oven  gas 
and blast furnace gas.  
Between  1990  and  1992,  breaks  in  time  series  may  occur  due  to  earlier 
reclassification of several sectors by the German administration; this particularly 
affects BKB, lignite and coke oven coke.  
Supply  
Hard coal mining in Germany ceased in 2018 with the last two hard coal mines 
being  closed  on  December  21,  2018  due  to  profitability  reasons.  Anthracite, 
coking coal and other bituminous coal show null production in 2019. 
 Data on stock changes in the coal production sector (provided individually for all 
coal  products)  are  no  longer  available from  2019  onwards  as the  companies  in 
this  sector  no  longer  operate.  For  the  other  sectors  (electricity  and  heat

producers, and industry), data on stock changes are only available for hard coal 
as an aggregate, and that is all reported under other bituminous coal. 
Transformation 
Breaks  in  time  series  between  2014  and  2015  for  coke  oven  gas  and  blast 
furnace  gas  are  due  to  a  reclassification  of  main  activity  producers  and 
autoproducers. 
In 1997, BKB inputs to gas works plants stopped. 
For some years of the period 1990-2002, discrepancies can appear between the 
publications  Coal  Information  and  Electricity  Information  in  Electricity  and  CHP 
plants for the products lignite, gas works gas, coke oven gas and blast furnace 
gas. 
Consumption 
Consumption of non-renewable municipal waste and other solid biofuels as 
a  reductant  occurs  in  German  blast  furnaces,  but  is  not  currently  quantified. 
Likewise, coal tar is a by-product of coke ovens, but not currently reported. 
The  data  providers  for  the  commercial  and  residential  sectors  were  coal 
producers  and  import  statistics,  the  first  reporting  the  biggest  amounts.  As  the 
hard coal production ceased in Germany, coal producer do not longer operate, 
and this data is not available from 2019. As consequence, the year 2019 shows 
a  significant  decrease  in  consumption  in  these  sectors.  In  2019,  there  was  no 
increase in the imports delivered to these sectors. 
Oil 
General notes 
In  2018,  decreases  in  refinery  intake  and  deliveries  to  the  market  can  be 
attributed to the temporary shutdown of two high-capacity refineries. 
In  2018,  there  are  breaks  in  time  series  for  several  products  due  to 
methodological  changes  involving  the  inclusion  of  companies  with  olefin  plants 
into  the  reporting group and  the  possibility  to  identify  semi-finished  products  as 
deliveries to the market.

In  2017,  the  German  administration  included  additional  firms  in  the  chemical 
sector  to  their  data  collection  system.  As  a  result,  for  2017  data  there  is  an 
increase in deliveries of oil products to the petrochemical sector.  
In  2016  the  German  administration  reclassified  the  consumption  of  a  chemical 
company  from  fuel  oil  to  other  oil  products.  This  leads  to  a  decrease  in  the 
supply  and  consumption  of  fuel  oil  with  a  corresponding  increase  for  other  oil 
products. Due to the assumptions made by the German administration about the 
energy consumption of the respective products, this also creates a break in time 
series in the split between energy and non-energy consumption for the chemical 
sector. 
In  2016  there  are  breaks  in  time  series  for  white  spirit  due  to  an  increase  in 
data coverage. Historical revisions are expected in the next edition.  
From  2000  data,  part  of  the  product  Andere  Rückstände  (other  residues)  is 
included with fuel oil instead of other oil products.  
Starting  from  1994  data,  there  has  been  a  reclassification  of  jet  gasoline  to 
kerosene type jet fuel. 
Prior  to  1979  data,  other  products  include  paraffin  waxes,  bitumen,  white 
spirit & SBP and lubricants for eastern Germany. 
The  methodology  to  determine  net  calorific  values  has  been  changed  for  2015 
data. The values for crude oil and refinery feedstocks were revised back to 2003. 
Transformation 
In  2018,  owing  to  methodological  changes,  inputs  of  motor  gasoline  for 
transformation use in the petrochemical industry are reported for the first time.  
Consumption 
In  2018,  owing  to  methodological  changes,  consumption  data  for  motor 
gasoline in the chemical and petrochemical industry as well as in non-specified 
industry are reported for the first time.  
In  2018,  consumption  data  for  motor  gasoline  and  gas/diesel  oil 
construction  and  agriculture/forestry  are  reported  where  they  had  previously 
in 
been subsumed within the commercial and public services sector.

Between  2002  and  2003,  breaks  in time  series  in  consumption  data  are due  to 
structural  changes  in  energy  statistics  following  the  newly  introduced  Energy 
Statistics Act.  
In  1995  data,  a  break  in  gas/diesel  oil  consumption  occurs  as  a  result  of  an 
alignment  with  the  Classification  of  the  Economic  Activities  in  the  European 
Community (NACE). 
Beginning  in  1994,  final  consumption  by  individual  sector  has  been  improved 
due to new survey methods instituted by the Minerölwirtschaftsverband.  
In  1989,  end-use  consumption  of  gas/diesel  oil  decreased  due  to  an 
exceptionally warm winter and a lowering of consumer stocks.  
Prior to 1980 data, consumption of fuel oil in blast furnaces was included in the 
iron and steel sector 
Prior  to  1970  data,  consumption  of  refinery  gas  in  the  chemical  industry  is 
included with refineries' own consumption. 
Natural gas 
General notes 
Between  2009  and  2010,  there  is  a  break  in  time  series  due  to  a  new,  more 
comprehensive  legal  framework  that  resulted  in  methodological  changes  for 
production and new calorific values for natural gas.  
Supply  
Starting  in  2018,  due  to  a  change  in  the  reporting  methodology,  Imports  and 
Exports no longer include transit volumes, as was the case up until 2017. 
Since  2018  onwards,  indigenous  production  is  being  phased  out,  leading  to  a 
decrease in non-associated gas 
Transformation 
In  2003,  there  is  a  break  in  time  series  for  input  to  electricity  and  CHP  plants 
(both autoproducers and main activity producers).  
Prior  to  1995,  inputs  of  natural  gas  for  main  activity  producer  heat  plants  are 
included with main activity producer CHP plants.

Consumption 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  German  administration  included  energy  use  in 
Agriculture/Forestry  and  Construction  for  the  period  2010-2018.  In  the  next 
reporting cycle, values for 2003-2010 are expected. 
Since 2018, gas distribution networks are included in pipeline transport, while it 
was only covering transmission networks before. 
Since 2003, there are no official data for the construction sector.  
Since  2003,  consumption  in  agriculture  and  non-specified  other,  which  were 
previously estimated, are no longer shown, and losses data have been included 
in statistical differences.  
Since 2003, gas consumption in coke ovens (transformation) was negligible.  
Between 2002 and 2003, there are breaks in time series for some sectors due to 
modifications in reporting methodology.  
Between  1994  and  1995,  there  are  some  breaks  in  time  series  due  to  the  fact 
that 
the 
industry  sub-sector  breakdown 
is  based  on 
the  1995  NACE 
classification.  
Also,  prior 
to  1995,  end-use 
consumption  data  are  based  on 
Arbeitsgemeinschaft Energiebilanzen.  
Before 1970 there is no detailed breakdown available for the industry sector with 
the exception of iron and steel and chemical and petrochemical industries. 
Biofuels and waste  
General notes 
In  the  2020  edition,  there  was  a  revision  of  nearly  all  renewables  data  back  to 
2003,  basically  related  to  error  correction  and  new  information.  This  leads  to  a 
break in series between 2002 and 2003. 
Starting with the 2020 edition, final consumption in the agriculture sector is now 
reported  separately.  Previously,  it  was  included  in  commercial  and  public 
services. 
Starting  in  2008,  municipal  waste  and  industrial  waste  data  were  collected 
separately. This leads to breaks in the time series between 2007 and 2008.

Between 1996 and 1997, a new survey for renewables causes breaks in the time 
series. 
Supply  
Trade  data  for  biogasoline  are  available  from  2004  and  for  biodiesels  from 
2003.  
Consumption 
Increased  consumption  of  industrial  wastes  (non-renewable)  in  the  non-
metallic minerals sector in 2018 is related to increased cement production due to 
a high level of activity in the construction sector. 
For  solid  biofuels  consumption  in  the  commercial  and  public  services  sector, 
new  data  were  derived  in  cooperation  with  the  Federal  Research  Institute  for 
Rural Areas, Forestry and Fisheries by applying a different calculation approach 
based on the total demand for material and energy use of the resource wood in 
Germany. This had resulted in break in time series between 2013 and 2014. 
Electricity and heat  
General notes 
In the 2014 edition, the German administration performed some major revisions 
back to 2003. This led to breaks in the time series between 2002 and 2003. 
The  German  administration  has  changed  the  methodology  for  reporting  heat 
over time:  
Starting  in  2007, more  information  is  available  on  main  activity  heat  plants  and 
additional  inputs  started to  be reported for  this  category. This causes  breaks  in 
time series between 2006 and 2007.  
Between 2003 and 2006, autoproducer heat output was provided, but no inputs.  
Between  2002  and  2003  and  between  2003  and  2004,  breaks  in  time  series 
occur,  due  to  the  implementation  of  the  Energy  Statistics  Act,  collection 
concerning  heat  produced  in  heat  plants  and  district  heating  plants  became 
more efficient and more complete. 
Prior  to  1970,  heat  production  and  consumption  have  been  estimated  by  the 
Secretariat  based  on  Energie-bilanz  der  Bundesrepublic  für  das  Jahr  1990 
provided by the German Institute for Economic Research.

Supply 
From 2018 onwards, own use of electricity at main electricity geothermal plants 
includes electricity used for pumping. 
In some instances, electricity generation from nuclear, hydro, solar, wind and 
biogases  in  autoproducer  electricity  plants  is  confidential  or  not  available  and 
therefore is included in main activity producer electricity plants. 
For  2017  onwards,  own-use  consumption  of  electricity  by  wind  plants  is 
assumed  to  be  2%  at  onshore  and  1.5%  for  off-shore  wind  farms.  For  prior 
years,  own-use  only  included  electricity  drawn  from  the  grid  while  the  turbines 
were not in operation. 
Since 2011, due to a reclassification of wind energy and solar photovoltaic in 
the  official  data  of  the  German  Federal  Statistical  Office,  the  production  is  now 
only reported under main activity producer plants. 
Electricity  production  from  other  sources  is  available  starting  in  2003.  This 
refers to the production of electricity from turbines which are located at pressure 
drops in fluid transport and from purchased waste heat. 
Prior  to  1991,  electricity  trade  data  includes  only  trade  of  the  Former  Federal 
Republic of Germany. 
Data on electricity production from wind and solar are available from 1986 and 
1990, respectively. 
Starting in 1984, small amounts of heat have been exported to Denmark. 
Transformation 
For 2018, the increase in electricity output from solar PV was in part due higher 
than average solar radiation during that year.  
For  2018,  the  increase  in  heat  output  from  biogases  was  mainly  due  to  an 
increase  in  survey  coverage  following  an  amendment  to  the  Energy  Statistics 
Law in 2017 
Electricity  inputs  to  both  mixed  hydro  and  pure  pumped  storage  pumping 
plants are reported under inputs to pure pumped storage.  
Detailed  data  by  fuel  are  not  available  for  total  heat  production.  The  non-
allocated  part  is  reported  as  heat  production  from  non-specified  combustible 
fuels.

Weather conditions were not favourable for wind and solar generation in 2016. 
In  2015,  a  reclassification  of  some  main  activity  producer  electricity  and  CHP 
plants  to  autoproducer  CHP  plants  powered  by  coke  oven  gas  results  in  a 
break in time series for this period. Similarly, a reclassification of blast furnace 
gas main activity electricity plants into autoproducer plants results in a break in 
time series for the same period.  
From 2003 onwards, all heat production in autoproducers is considered as non-
sold (i.e. for self-use) and, therefore, not reported. Inputs for this heat production 
are no longer reported in the transformation sector. 
For 2002 and 2003, the German administration did not submit the breakdown of 
electricity  and  heat  production  from  combustible  fuels.  The  data  were 
estimated  as  follows:  renewables  and  waste  were  taken  from  the  Renewables 
and  Waste  Questionnaire  and  the  other  combustible  fuels  were  estimated  pro 
rata based on 2001 estimates. 
Prior to 2003, electricity production in electricity plants includes production from 
CHP  plants  and  heat  production  in  CHP  plants  includes  production  from  heat 
plants.  
Due  to  the  implementation  of  the  Energy  Statistics  Act,  collection  concerning 
heat  produced  in  heat  plants  and  district  heating  plants  became  more  efficient 
and more complete. This leads to breaks in time series between 2002 and 2003 
and between 2003 and 2004. 
A  new  survey  for  the  renewable  products  can  cause  breaks  in  the  time  series 
between 1998 and 1999. 
Prior to 1993, all heat production from BKB/peat briquettes is included in main 
activity producer CHP plants. 
Consumption 
Increases  in  2016  electricity  generation  by  auto-producers  within  the transport 
equipment sector are due to reclassification from main activity generation, rather 
than development of new plant. 
More  information  on  district  heat  became  available,  causing  breaks  in  the  time 
series between 2006 and 2007.  
Data on geothermal heat production and direct consumption are only available 
starting in 2003.

Data  for  electricity  consumption  in  the  commercial  and  public  services  sector 
include  the  construction  and  agriculture/forestry  sectors  (prior  to  2010),  as  well 
as the fishing sector (all years).  
In  2000,  revisions 
from 
the  German  administration 
to 
the  electricity 
consumption data may cause breaks in the time series.  
In  1995,  the  German  Federal  Statistics  Office  reclassified  some  industrial 
branches which may cause a break in time series in industry sub-sectors. 
Between  1971  and  1980  electricity  consumption  in  coal  mines  includes 
consumption in coke ovens and BKB plants.

Coal 
Supply 
In  2019p  data  there  was  a  significant  decrease  in  lignite  production  and 
consumption due to less power generation in the country using this fuel. 
Oil  
General notes 
In the 2016 edition, the Greek administration reclassified gasoline-type jet fuel as 
aviation gasoline starting from 2009 data. 
Between 2012 and 2013, breaks time in time series for biodiesel, lubricants and 
stocks appear due to the introduction of a new reporting system.  
Supply  
Crude  oil  production  stopped  on  30 November  1998  and  started  again  in 
December 1999.  
From 1986 data onwards, information on refinery feedstocks is available  
Transformation 
From  1990  onwards,  there  has  been  an  increased  use  of  refinery  gas  in 
electricity generation, replacing fuel oil. 
Consumption 
In  2020,  consumption  of  gas/diesel  oil  in  electricity/CHP/heat  plants  (energy 
sector)  refers  to  quantities  used  to  support  operations  of  a  lignite  plant.  For 
previous years, they are reported in the transformation sector as inputs for CHP 
production in main activity plants.

In  2013  data,  the  drop  of  gas/diesel  oil  residential  consumption  is  linked  with 
changes in the taxation of heating oil. 
From 1993 data onwards, more information is available on the allocation of fuel 
oil to specific industrial sub-sectors. Fuel oil consumption in the agriculture and 
residential sectors has been replaced by gas/diesel oil starting in 1993. 
Prior  to  1987  data,  consumption  in  the  commerce/public  services  sector  is 
included  with  residential.  Peaks  in  residential  sector  consumption  in  1978  and 
1982 are due to unusually cold winters. 
Natural gas 
General notes 
Natural gas produced in Greece has a higher than average gross calorific value 
due to a high content of C2/C4 hydrocarbons. 
In the 2020 edition, due to more disaggregated data and a revised methodology, 
years 2017 and 2018 are not comparable to time-series prior to this. 
Supply  
In  November  1998  the  indigenous  production  of  natural  gas  stopped  in  and 
started again in December 1999. 
In  1997,  Greece  started  importing  natural  gas  as  a  result  of  a  new  operational 
pipeline between Russia and Greece. 
Consumption 
In 2011 there is a break in time series for the non-ferrous metals due to a new 
methodology for measuring gas consumption in this sub-sector.  
Since  2017,  natural  gas  has  started  to  be  consumed  in  the  construction  sub-
sector as well. 
For  1998  data,  consumption 
in 
the  residential  sector 
is 
included  with 
commercial/public services.

Biofuels and waste  
General notes 
New  information  on  solid  biofuels  is  available  from  1996  and  leads  to  breaks 
between 1995 and 1996. 
Data for  biogases  are  available  from  1990  and data for  industrial waste from 
1992. 
Supply 
Indigenous  production  and  domestic  supply  of  industrial  waste  have  been 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat for 2019p. 
Indigenous  production  of  solid  biofuels is  estimated  by  the IEA  Secretariat for 
2015 based on consumption. 
Transformation 
The  big  increase  in  delivery  of  industrial  waste  to  autoproducer  CHP  plant  in 
2010 is mainly due to the opening of a new plant. 
Inputs of solid biofuels to charcoal production are estimated for 2007 to 2010 
by the IEA Secretariat assuming an efficiency of 40%. 
Industrial  waste  used  in  autoproducer  CHP  plants  decreased  substantially  in 
2006 because a plant closed. 
Consumption 
Solid  biofuels  consumption  in  commercial/public  services  is  included  in 
residential until 2011. 
The consumption of solid biofuels in the paper, pulp and printing industry is not 
available from 2003 to 2012. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply  
In  the  2020  edition,  revisions  for  1998  –  2017  of  the  indigenous  production  of 
solar  thermal  are  the  result  of  a  revision  of  the  latest  data  on  solar  thermal 
efficiency.

For  2016,  gross  electricity  generation  from  combustible  fuels  in  main  activity 
electricity  and  autoproducer  CHP  units  was  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat, 
based  upon  the gross to  net ratio for  combustible fuels for these  plant types  in 
2015. This increase in production was assigned to lignite-fired and natural gas-
fired plant. 
Transformation 
Prior to 2020, use of gas/diesel oil to support operations (rather than generate 
lignite-fired  Main  CHP  plant  operations  was  reported  as  a 
power)  at 
transformation input. 
Data  on  heat  outputs  from  natural  gas-fired  Autoproducer  CHP  plants  are 
available from 2020. 
In  2008  a  new  plant  using  refinery  gas  started  operating  in  an  experimental 
phase, causing a low efficiency. 
Production and consumption of distributed heat (heat sold) that is produced from 
lignite is available from 1997. 
Data  for  biofuels  and  waste  input  and  output  to  transformation  are  available 
from 1992. 
Consumption 
In  2018,  breaks  in  consumption  occur  across  several  sectors  due  to  improved 
disaggregation.  This  allowed  consumption  previously  reported  under  industry 
(non-specified) to be reported in the appropriate subsectors. 
In  2018,  the  increase  in  efficiency  at  industrial  waste-fired  autoproducer  CHP 
plants was due to increased generation of unsold heat. 
Prior  to  2018,  electricity  consumption  in  the  fishing  sector  was  included  in 
agriculture and forestry, and/or industry – non-specified. 
Transmission and distribution losses of electricity increased from 2013 onwards 
due to growth in non-technical losses. Reported losses for 2017 deviate from this 
trend, showing a noticeable decline compared with adjacent year however, data 
for 2017 are under review. 
Electricity  consumption  in  road  is  available  from  2013.  This  refers  to 
transport  vehicles  (e.g.  trolley  buses).  Electricity 
consumption  by  public 
consumption by private electric vehicles is insignificant and not included.

General notes 
Data are available starting in 1965. 
The Hungarian administration submitted questionnaires to the IEA Secretariat for 
the first time with 1993 data. 
Coal 
General notes 
In the 2020 edition, revisions back to 2014 were done for blast furnace gas to 
report  separately  the  energy  consumption  for  the  support  of  blast  furnaces. 
Previously,  this  consumption  was  reported  as  final  consumption  in  the  industry 
iron & steel. 
From  1992,  the  production  of  sub-bituminous  coal  has  been  included  with 
lignite  due  to  the  low  quality  of  the  coal.  From  1990  to  1999,  the  use  of  this 
domestic coal in main activity producer electricity and CHP plants has also been 
reclassified  to  lignite.  Since  2017,  imports,  transformation  and  consumption  of

Transformation 
Some CHP units consuming blast furnace gas and coke oven gas were under 
maintenance in 2018. 
In  2017,  a  main  activity  CHP  plant  using  other  bituminous  coal  was  merged 
with  an  industrial  unit  of  the  pulp,  paper  and  print  sector  and  was  since 
reclassified as an autoproducer. 
Autoproducer  heat  and  power  plants  using  coke  oven  gas  and  blast  furnace

Consumption 
In  the  2022  edition,  revisions  back  to  2017  were  made  for  the  non-metallic 
minerals industry, by reallocating some quantities previously reported as lignite 
to BKB. 
The  cement  industry  in  Hungary  is  progressively  replacing  the  consumption  of 
coal by waste. This situation is translated to a decreasing trend in consumption 
of other bituminous coal in the non-metallic minerals industry. 
The  consumption  of  coal  tar  in  the  category  Non-Energy  Use  (petrochemical 
sector)  increases  in  the  year  2019.  In  previous  years,  CO2  quotes  prevented 
companies of this sector from using more coal tar, but in 2019 they installed new 
CO2 filters, that enabled them to use more coal tar keeping CO2 emission on the 
same level. 
Oil  
General notes  
From 2010, from other sources - natural gas of other hydrocarbons correspond 
to hydrogen used in refineries for hydrodesulphurization, also represented as the 
output of non-specified transformation in the balances format.  
Starting from 1998, data for additives and aviation gasoline are available. 
In  the  2022  edition,  other  oil  products  include  ethylene,  toluene,  sulphur  and 
FCC residue from 2012 onwards. 
From  1994  onwards,  other  products  include  aromatics  and  other  products  that 
were previously included mainly under white spirit. Prior to 1993, white spirit is 
included  in  motor  gasoline.  Data  for  refinery  gas,  paraffin  waxes  and 
lubricants are partly estimated by the Secretariat. 
Supply  
In  2020,  changes  in  the  national  legislation  mandated  an  increase  in  the 
minimum blending of biofuels. 
Consumption  
In the 2016 and 2017 editions, revisions to consumption data back to 2010 were 
provided by the Hungarian administration following a survey introduced in 2014. 
This results in breaks in time series between 2009 and 2010.

Natural gas  
General notes 
Since  2022,  one  chp  plant  has  been  reclassified  to  an  autoproducer  electricity 
plant. 
Between  2012  and  2013  there  are  some  breaks  in  time  series  for  the  energy, 
transport and industry sectors consumption due to a new methodology. Historical 
revisions are pending. 
Between  1996  and  1997  some  breaks  in  time  series  exist  due  to  a  new 
methodology applied by the Hungarian administration.  
Supply  
In 2021 preliminary data, there are no more Exports reported due to a change in 
methodology to eliminate the reporting of transit trade. 
Imports  and  Exports  data  are  reported  according  to  the  TSO’s  data,  which 
include transit volumes. 
Transformation  
Since  2010,  data  reported  for  non-specified  transformation  represent  natural 
gas used for hydrogen manufacture used in refineries for hydrodesulphurization. 
Prior to this year, these quantities are reported under oil refineries. 
Since 1997 two autoproducer heat plants have been reclassified to main activity 
producer heat plants. 
Consumption  
Beginning  in  2016,  electricity  consumption  under  the  non-specified  other sector 
includes military usage, following recent clearance to disseminate these data.  
Prior to 2004 iron and steel consumption includes transformation of natural gas 
in blast furnaces (transformation).

Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
Data for biogases are available from 2000; for industrial waste from 2003; for 
biodiesel production from 2007.  
Supply 
A  2012  change  in  biogasoline  reporting  methodology  results  in  break  in  time 
series between 2011 and 2012. 
Consumption 
In  2019,  increased  consumption  in  the  non-metallic  minerals  sector  for  solid 
biofuels and municipal wastes is related to fuel switching from coal. 
In  the  2018  edition,  the  Hungarian  administration  has  revised  solid  biofuels 
consumption  in  other  sectors  back  to  2005  based  on  the  new  survey  from 
Hungarian Central Statistical Office (HCSO). This resulted in break in time series 
between 2004 and 2005. 
A  new  reporting  methodology  for  the  direct  use  of  geothermal  energy  was 
applied from 2014 resulting in break in time series between 2013 and 2014. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply 
For  2017  onwards,  inputs  and  outputs from  power  plants  are  reported  at  a  unit 
level, while for prior years, data are reported at a plant level. As a result, breaks 
in  series  are  observed  between  2016  and  2017.  In  particular,  for  electricity 
output  from  main  activity  producer  CHP  and  main  activity  producer  nuclear 
power  plants,  and  for  heat  output  from  industrial  waste  at  autoproducer CHP 
and autoproducer heat plants. 
In 2017, a main activity producer CHP plant was reclassified as an autoproducer. 
As a result, declines are observed in heat production from other bituminous coal 
and industrial waste, as heat reported as previously sold may now be considered 
as used onsite.

Other  sources  electricity  and  heat  production  is  available  from  2013  and 
represents generation from residual tail gases from the manufacturing of soot as 
well as from hydrogen. 
Geothermal heat production from main activity producer heat plants is available 
from 1995. 
Nuclear  electricity  production  in  main  activity  producer  electricity  plants  is 
available from 1983. 
Transformation 
In 2020, the efficiency of blast furnace gas- and coke oven gas-fired main heat 
plants was revised downwards back to 2017 to better reflect trade of coal gases 
and hot air between adjacent facilities. 
In  2019,  some  breaks  in  series  occur  for  plants  fired  by  biogas  and  solid 
biofuels due to changes in plant classifications, and CHP methodologies.  
In late 2017, a new geothermal power plant began operations.  
For  2017,  the  decline  in  heat  production from  industrial waste  is  partly  due  to 
the reclassification of a main activity producer as an autoproducer. 
Heat  and  electricity  consumption  by  military  services  is  reported  under  Other 
sectors - non-specified for the first time in 2015. The change is due to the recent 
authorization  to  disseminate  these  data.  Previously  they  were  included  under 
Commercial and public services.  
From  2014  data  onwards,  more  data  suppliers  were  involved  in  submitting 
energy data to the national administration, causing new autoproducer time series 
to appear for geothermal and industrial waste plants. 
In  2014  data,  some  CHP  plants  running  on  solid  biofuels  produced  only  heat 
and were reclassified to heat plants. 
The  Hungarian  administration  reclassified  some  of  their  plants  between  1996 
and 2000, which may lead to breaks in the time series. 
Prior  to  2000,  electricity  output  from  sub-bituminous  coal  is  included  with 
lignite. 
Data on electricity and heat production from solid biofuels in autoproducer CHP 
plants are available from 1995.

General notes 
In the 2022 edition, some supply flows from 2015 to 2019 are estimated by the 
IEA Secretariat, in particular stock changes and imports. 
Between 2015 and 2016, there are breaks for several products due to a change 
in 
the  
methodology by the Icelandic administration. 
In  2014, the Icelandic  administration  revised  petroleum coke  data from 1990  to 
exclude imports of anodes for the aluminium industry.

Supply 
The rise in heat supply in 2018 is due to an increase in the number of residential 
and commercial connections to new and existing district heating networks.  
The increase in hydro and geothermal electricity production from 2007 is due to 
the expansion of the aluminium industry. 
The increase in geothermal electricity production in 2018 is due to a new 90MW 
power plant, half of which came online in 2017, and half in 2018. 
From  2016  onwards,  the  decline  in  electricity  production  from  wind  is  due  to  a 
combination of lower wind speeds and lower installed capacity. 
Transformation 
From 2017 onwards, due to data quality issues, the reported efficiency of electric 
boilers exceeds 100%. Revisions are pending. 
For  2016,  access  to  improved  data  revealed  considerably  better  heat  plant 
efficiencies  than  previously  inferred,  with  increases  in  heat  production  seen 
during this period.  
From  2013  data,  the  Hellisheidi  geothermal  power  plant,  previously  reported 
under main activity electricity plant, was categorised as main activity CHP plant. 
Heat production from municipal waste is available from 1993 and stops in 2010. 
In  1998,  60  MW  of  generating  capacity  was  installed  in  the  geothermal  CHP 
plant at Nesjavellir. Since the plant was inoperable for four months, production of 
geothermal  heat  decreased  compared  to  1997.  The  extra  electricity  capacity 
caused  electricity  production from  geothermal to  almost  double  over the  same 
period. 
Electricity  production  from  geothermal  sources  in  main  activity  producer  CHP 
plants is available from 1992. 
Consumption 
The increase in electricity consumption in the non-metallic minerals sector from 
2017onwards is due to the opening of a silicon production facility, PCC Bakki. 
The significant increase in electricity consumption in the commercial and public 
services  sector  from  2015  onwards  is  due  to  the  growth  of  cryptocurrency 
mining.

In  the  2015  edition,  the  heat  consumption  breakdown  by  sector  for  the  years 
Icelandic 
1990  onwards  has  become  available 
following  reviews  by 
the 
administration.  In  addition,  heat  consumption  was  revised  significantly  upwards 
as  more  information  became  available.  This  has  caused  large  breaks  in  time 
series across the heat balance between 1989 and 1990. 
Direct use of geothermal in the industrial sector is reported under non-specified 
industry,  as  the  Icelandic  administration  decided  not  to  estimate  the  allocation 
amongst the sub-sectors of industry. 
Revisions in direct use of geothermal heat starting in 2013 create breaks in time 
series between 2012 and 2013. 
Electricity  consumption  in  non-specified  transport  includes  consumption  for 
ferries and cruise lines. 
Non-specified  consumption  of  electricity  within  the  energy sector  refers mainly 
to  the  use  of  electricity  by  the  geothermal  industry  to  pump  hot  water  from 
underground  sources,  and  from  1991,  also  includes  electricity  used  for  the 
transport by pipeline of hot water from Nesjavellir to Reykjavik. 
The increase of electricity consumption in the construction sector from 2004 to 
2007 is due to the drilling of tunnels for the Kárahnjúkar power plant. 
The consumption of electricity reported in non-specified other corresponds to a 
NATO base at Keflavik airport which closed in 2005. 
Prior to 1990, all heat for space heating was reported in residential. 
The residential sector includes agriculture prior to 1983. 
Prior  to  1970,  total  final  consumption  includes  inputs  to  and  outputs  from  heat 
production and non-energy use. After 1970, data on inputs and outputs in CHP 
plants and in main activity producer heat plants (district heat plants) and for non-
energy use are separately specified.

General notes 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  Irish  administration  modified  the  methology  to  estimate 
supply  of  solid  fuels.  Consequently,  revisions  were  made  back  to  2011  for 
anthracite, other bituminous coal and BKB. 
In the 2021 edition, SEAI revised their methodology for anthracite imports. The 
figures  for  the  years  2012  to  2018  were  revised  up  and  are  now  aligned  with 
those  from  the  Central  Statistics  Office  of  Ireland.  The  difference  with  the  old 
values was assigned to the residential sector. 
Due  to  confidentiality  reasons,  anthracite  imports  include  anthracite  and 
manufactured ovoids. 
In the 2021 edition, SEAI revised other bituminous coal consumption by sector 
for the period 2005-2011. The same methodology that was used from 2012 was 
applied to the period 2005-2011 to align the time series. 
Due  to  confidentiality  issues  patent  fuel  quantities  are  reported  aggregated  to 
anthracite figures. 
Due to confidentiality reasons, inputs of anthracite, other bituminous coal and 
peat  briquettes  for  patent  fuel  transformation  are  reported  with  residential 
consumption. 
Prior to 1990, any imports of BKB were included with imports of peat products, 
as is the case for consumption. 
The  calorific  value  for  peat  production  is  weighted  according  to  the  origin:  sod 
peat  and milled  peat.  Sod  peat  has  a  higher  calorific  value  than  milled  peat. In 
2019, the production of milled peat decreased while sod peat stayed stable; this 
resulted in an overall higher weighted value.

Supply 
Ireland  stopped  harvesting  peat  in  2020  and  will  phase  out  production  of  peat 
briquettes by 2024. 
Rainfall in 2012 led to the lowest peat harvest since IEA records began in 1960, 
requiring  large  stock  drawdown  and  increased  use  of  biofuels  for  electricity 
generation.  In  2013,  production  targets  were  met  before  the  end  of  the  year 
however  production  continued  in  order  to  further  build  stocks  to  alleviate  the 
potential impacts of future weather events. 
Low production of peat in 1985 was due to a poor “harvest”, due to an unusually 
wet summer. 
Production data for peat products (briquettes) are available from 1975. 
Transformation 
From  2018  the  consumption  of  other  bituminous  coal  decreases  significantly 
as a result of the decline in coal-fired power generation. Imports of this product 
decrease accordingly. 
A reclassification caused a break in the time series for peat consumption in the 
energy industry own use in BKB/peat product plants from 1989 to 1990. 
The production of gas works gas ceased in 1987 due to fuel switching to natural 
gas. 
Other bituminous coal inputs to main activity producer electricity plants increased 
from 1986 due to three new generating units at Moneypoint coming on-line. 
Consumption 
The decrease in residential consumption of anthracire in 2019 is consequence of 
warmer weather, among other reasons. 
The consumption of other bituminous coal and peat in the food, tobacco and 
beverages industry stopped in 2019.

Oil 
General notes 
In the 2018 edition the Irish administration revised the methodology for reporting 
final  consumption  of  oil  products. This  leads  to some  breaks  in  series  between 
2015 and 2016. 
From other sources - natural gas of other hydrocarbons correspond to natural 
gas blended with refinery gas. 
For  confidentiality  reasons, 
inputs  of  petroleum  coke 
into  patent 
fuel 
transformation are reported with residential consumption. 
Supply 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  Irish  administration  revised  gas/diesel  oil  and  fuel  oil 
consumption in international marine bunkers from 2006 onwards. 
Consumption 
In the 2021 edition, oil consumption data were revised back to 1990 by the Irish 
administration  to  incorporate  the  results  of  the  Business  Energy  Use  Survey 
(BEUS), which provided a level of detail not previously available.  
In 2014, the drop of fuel oil consumption in non-metallic minerals sector is linked 
with the replacement of HFO boilers by natural gas boilers as the primary source 
of steam for alumina production.  
In 2013 and 2014, bitumen consumption data are not available and calculated as 
residual. 
Between 2008 and 2009, there is a break in time series for gas/diesel oil, LPG, 
kerosene-type  jet  fuel  and  petroleum  coke  due  to  a  new  methodology  being 
applied  to  sectoral  demand  by  Sustainable  Energy  Ireland  (SEI).  This  change 
also  explains  breaks  between  2006  and  2007  for  bitumen,  lubricants,  white 
spirit, and paraffin waxes. 
Between  1989  and  1990,  breaks  in  time  series  appear  for  consumption  of 
gas/diesel  oil,  LPG,  other  kerosene  and  fuel  oil  as  a  result  of  a  detailed 
consumption survey done for 1993. Data for historical years back to 1990 were 
revised by the national administration based on the results of this survey. 
From 1986, gas/diesel oil consumption in the agricultural sector is available.

From  1970  to  1977,  the  split  between  commercial  and  public  services  and 
agricultural  use  of  other  kerosene  has  been  estimated  by  the  Secretariat. 
Consumption  in  commercial/public  services  includes  quantities  used  by  state-
owned agricultural companies. 
Natural gas 
General notes 
Since April 2017 there is no gas storage facility in Ireland. 
Supply 
Natural gas production has been increasing since 2015, as the Corrib Gas field 
began production at the end of that year. 
Since  1996,  the  increase  in  imports  is  due  to  the  depletion  of  the  Kinsale  gas 
field and the availability of a new pipeline system to the United Kingdom. 
Transformation 
Since  2006,  a  different  methodology 
for  allocating  unsold  steam 
from 
autoproducer CHP is used.  
Non specified transformation corresponds to natural gas blended with refinery 
gas. 
Consumption  
In the 2020 edition, the results of the Business Energy Use Survey (BEUS) from 
2009  to  2017,  published  by  the  Central  Statistics  Office,  were  used  as  a  new 
basis  for  the  breakdown  of  energy  use  in  the  consumption  sector.  Additionally 
data  was  revised  for  the  2001  to  2009  period  in  order  to  avoid  a  timeseries 
break.  
In the 2019 edition, the Irish administration revised the distribution losses based 
on  new  data  coming  from  the  Emissions  Trading  Scheme  (ETS),  which  had  a 
knock-on effect in the final consumption data, primarily for the industry sector. 
In 2011 the increase in non-ferrous metals consumption is due to a fuel switch to 
natural gas.  
Since 2009, the disaggregation of consumption into all the industry sub sectors 
excluding  non-ferrous  metals  is  done  according  to  data  from  the  Census  of

Industrial Production (CIP). The last energy consumption data available from the 
CIP  are  from  2009  and  therefore  the  2009-2015  subsector  breakdown  is  the 
same every year. 
In  2007  the  increase  in  machinery  consumption  is  due  to  changes  in  industry 
sub-sector structure and fuel usage.  
In  2004,  there  is  a  break  in  the  time  series  in  food,  beverages  and  tobacco 
consumption due to a change in methodology.  
In 2003, feedstock use in the chemical and petrochemical industry stopped due 
to the shutdown of a fertiliser plant.  
In 2001, natural gas consumption in the iron and steel industry stopped due to 
the shutdown of Ireland’s main steel plant.  
Prior to 1986, detailed consumption figures for the use of natural gas in industry 
and other sectors are not available.  
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
Data for municipal waste are available from 2009. 
Data for solid biofuels and biogases are available from 1990.  
Supply 
In  2022  edition,  biogasoline  production  figures  were  revised.  The  production 
started in 2017. 
In 2020, a new biodiesel plant began to produce. 
Due to increased demand from a second waste to energy electricity plant which 
began  operation  in  2017,  production  of  municipal  waste  increased  sharply 
starting in late 2017. 
Prior  to  2011,  production  and  trade  of  biogasoline  and  biodiesels  cannot  be 
distinguished due to confidentiality issues. 
Transformation 
In 2022 edition, 2019 solar PV generation figures were significantly revised. 
In 2020, biogas started to be blended with natural gas in the main network.

World energy balances 2022 Edition 
 
Starting  in  2016,  the  increase  of  electricity  production  of  solid  biofuels  is  a 
result of a decarbonisation programme and comes from a plant which is co-firing 
peat and biomass. 
In  2012  and  2013,  the  renewable  fraction  of  tyre-derived  fuel  (12%)  used  by  a 
cement  plant  was  reported  by  the  administration  under  renewable  municipal 
waste; the non-renewable fraction (88%) was reported under industrial waste. 
Consumption 
In  the  2021  edition,  there  were  revisions  to  the  residential  sector  for  solid 
biofuels (excluding charcoal). 
In  the  2020  edition,  Ireland  started  reporting  Pipeline  transport  based  on  the 
Emissions Trading Scheme data, available since 2005. The increase in 2016 is 
due to the coming on stream of the Corrib gas field. 
The Biofuels Obligation Scheme places an obligation on suppliers of mineral oil 
to  ensure  that  8.695%  (by  volume)  of  the  gas/diesel  oil  they  place  on  the 
market  in  Ireland  is  produced  from  renewable  sources,  e.g.  bioethanol  and 
biodiesel.  The  obligation  was  increased  from  the  1st  January,  2017,  from  the 
previous level of 6.383%. 
Despite the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, bioethanol consumption decreased in 
2017  because  there  was  a  reduction  in  overall  motor  gasoline  use  and  of  fuel 
tourism. 
Increases  in  biodiesel  consumption  in  2017  are  related  to  the  Biofuels 
Obligation Scheme and to increases in road freight, which is heavily dependent 
on diesel oil. 
The  consumption  of pure  biodiesel  in the  industry  sector  and  in  road transport 
refers to one site, which is no longer in operation since 2014.  
Electricity and heat 
Supply 
In  the  2019  edition,  revisions  were  made  by  the  Irish  administration  for  the 
indigenous production of solar thermal for the years 2011 – 2016.  
Electricity production from wind begins in 1992 and from biogases in 1996. For 
wind,  data  for  autoproducers  are  included  in  main  activity  producers  prior  to 
2002 for confidentiality reasons.

World energy balances 2022 Edition 
 
Transformation 
In 2018 and 2019, electricity output from other bituminous coal declined due to 
a shutdown at Moneypoint power station. 
In  2017,  a  new  municipal  waste-fired  main  activity  producer  electricity  plant 
(Dublin waste-to-energy) began operations.  
In  the  2016  edition,  revisions  were  introduced  in  the  electricity  generation  by 
fuel  from  2010  due  to  improved  data  available  from  the  transmission  system 
operator. 
In 2015, a new combined cycle gas turbine plant began commercial operations 
at Great Island power station, replacing the existing heavy fuel oil power plant.  
In  2012,  a  new  municipal  waste-fired  main  activity  producer  electricity  plant 
(Meath waste-to-energy) began operations. 
In  2011,  very  little  electricity  was  produced  from  pumped  hydro  following 
Turlough Hill, Ireland’s pumped storage station, being taken offline in late 2010 
up until February 2012. The 2011 values appear as zero due to rounding.  
From 1984 to 1989, inputs of hard coal in autoproducer CHP plants have been 
estimated by the Secretariat. 
Consumption 
In  the  2021  edition,  electricity  consumption  data  were  revised  back  to  1990  to 
incorporate  the  results  of  the  Business  Energy  Use  Survey  (BEUS),  which 
provided a level of detail not previously available.  
In  2004,  the  increase  of  electricity  consumption  is  due  to  the  new  light  rail 
transit system in Dublin.  
The decrease of electricity consumption in the iron and steel sector from 2001 
onwards is due to Ireland’s main steel plant ceasing production. 
Prior  to  1990,  electricity  consumption  in  agriculture/forestry  is  included  with 
residential. 
Electricity  consumption  in  the  iron  and  steel  industry  includes  consumption  in 
the non-ferrous metals industry prior to 1990. 
Data  for  direct  use  of  geothermal  heat  and  solar  thermal  heat  are  available 
from 1989 and 1990, respectively.

Israel 
Source 
Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, Jerusalem.  
General notes 
Data are available starting in 1971. 
The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the 
relevant Israeli administration. The use of such data by the OECD and/or the IEA 
is  without  prejudice  to  the  status  of  the  Golan  Heights,  East  Jerusalem  and 
Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law. 
Due  to  the  unavailability  of  data  for  certain  fuels,  IEA  estimations  are  also 
present  in  Israel  data.  In  particular  this  is  valid  for  oil  data  in  2014  and  2015, 
natural gas data from 2012 onwards, renewables and waste data in 2013. 
Coal  
Transformation 
In  2018  (data  year)  the  methodology  for  calculating  consumption  in  the 
transformation sector (electricity and heat producers) was modified. This creates 
a break in the time series between 2017 and 2018. 
Oil  
General notes 
Supply data for 2013 to 2020 have been provided by the Israel Central Bureau of 
Statistics.  Demand  data for  2013 to  2020  was  revised  and  estimated  based  on 
Israel’s national energy balance and the partial data made available by the Israel 
Central  Bureau  of  Statistics.  As  a  result,  breaks  in  time  series  may  appear 
between 2012 and 2013. 
 Israel’s national energy balance aggregates bitumen, petroleum coke and other 
oil products. The split of these products was estimated by the IEA secretariat for 
all flows.

The split of refinery output and consumption between kerosene type jet fuel and 
other kerosene was also estimated by the IEA Secretariat.  
Supply and consumption of kerosene type jet fuel for 2011 and 2012 have been 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
From  2007  to  2009,  oil  data  are  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on 
information from the Ministry of National Infrastructures. 
Supply  
In  2018  the  CDU  3  unit  and  hydrocracker  facility  at  Bazan  refinery  was  under 
maintenance. In 2017 the catalytic reformer unit underwent maintenance.  
Quantities  of  other  hydrocarbons  represent  natural  gas  used  in  refineries, 
including for the operation of the cogeneration power stations.  
From 2010 onwards, white spirit is included in other products. 
Transformation 
In  2017  Bazan  refinery  underwent  maintenance  to  upgrade  its  continuous 
catalytic  reformer,  isomerization  units  and  the  naphtha  catalytic  hydrotreating 
unit.  
Consumption  
From 2015, energy use of gas/diesel oil and other kerosene in Not elsewhere 
specified (Other sectors) are estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
From  2013,  consumption  data  are  based  on  a  new  and  detailed  classification 
system and on estimations made by the Israeli administration. 
Natural gas 
General notes 
Data for 2020p  are estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
The 2021 edition includes 2019 data and revisions in consumption based on the 
Energy Balances published by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). As 
a result, breaks in time series appear between 2012 and 2013. More specifically, 
this revision impacted oil refineries, the industry sector and other sectors. Finally,

all industry is categorised as non-specified industry and all other sectors as non-
specified other, because no disaggregation is available. 
 From  2012,  all  natural  gas  data,  except  inputs  to  electricity  production  and  oil 
refineries, have been estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
Supply  
Imports of natural gas began in 2008. 
Transformation 
In the 2017 edition, the Israeli administration revised transformation sector data 
back to 2013, introducing breaks in the series between 2012 and 2013. 
In  the  2019  edition,  the  not  elsewhere  specified  (transformation)  since  2013 
refers to quantities of natural gas used for the generation of hydrogen, which is 
subsequently  used  for  hydrodesulphurization  in  oil  refineries.  In  the  previous 
editions,  these  figures  were  reported  as  energy  consumption  of  gas  in  oil 
refineries. 
In  the  2019  edition  the  2016  and  2017  data  for  inputs  to  electricity  production 
were estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
Biofuels and waste  
General notes  
Data for 2019p are estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
Data  on  imports  and  consumption  of  charcoal  are  estimated  since  1992  using 
data  from  the  Forestry  Production  and  Trade  database  from  the  Food  and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 
Electricity and heat  
Supply  
Electricity production from wind begins in 2001. 
Autoproducer electricity generation from chemical heat (production of sulphuric 
acid)  occurs,  but  is  not  reported  separately  or  included  elsewhere  in  national 
totals, prior to 2017.

For  2020,  transmission  and  distribution  losses  for  electricity  include  losses 
incurred during the operation of pumped hydro facilities.  
Transformation  
For  the  2018  reporting  cycle,  Israel  revised  their  methodology  to  better  reflect 
actual plant classifications. As a result, breaks in series occur between 2017 and 
2018 for output from all plant types. 
Prior  to  2018,  inputs  to  autoproducer  CHP  plants  (then  reported  under  auto 
electricity plants) included inputs used to generate unsold heat. As a result, there 
is an apparent increase in efficiency for some fuels between 2017 and 2018.  
For  2017  data  and  onwards,  due  to  confidentiality  concerns,  electricity 
production  reported  under  auto  producer  wind  includes  generation  from  main 
activity wind, total hydro, and autoproducer biogases. Similarly, for 2016 data, 
reported auto producer solar PV generation includes total generation from hydro 
and wind. 
For 2013 and 2014, other oil products inputs to autoproducer electricity plants 
were estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
Data on heat production from main CHP plants are not available. 
Consumption  
Solar  thermal  indigenous  production  and  direct  consumption  have  been 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat from 2012 to 2017, using data published in the 
IEA-Solar  Heating  and  Cooling  Programme  Annual  Report.  These  estimations 
may create breaks in time series between 2011 and 2012 as well as 2017 and 
2018. 
For 2013 onwards, for reasons of confidentiality, electricity consumption in non-
ferrous  metals  is  included  under  mining  and  quarrying,  and  consumption  in 
chemical  (including  petrochemical)  and  construction  is  included  under  not 
elsewhere specified (industry).  
For 2013, and 2015 onwards, the split of electricity consumption in industry has 
been  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat.  In  addition,  electricity  consumption  in 
agriculture  and  forestry  for  2015  onwards  has  also  been  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat. 
Electricity  own  use,  as  well  as  transmission  and  distribution  losses  were 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat from 2010 to 2012.

General note 
A  change  in  methodology  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series  for  industry  and 
transformation between 2003 and 2004. 
Coal  
General notes 
The increase in production of coke oven gas in 2012 was the consequence of 
improvements in scope of reporting. As such, coke oven gas data in prior years 
should be viewed as under-representing production and consumption, and coke 
oven efficiencies will likewise appear lower than actual. 
Due to a change in the survey system, breaks in time series may occur between 
1997 and 1998 for final consumption. 
From 1986 onwards, figures from lignite are given using the same methodology 
as in the Bilancio Energetico Nazionale. 
Supply 
In the 2018 edition, production of coke oven coke, coke oven gas, coal tar and 
other  recovered  gases  was  revised  back  to  2014  due  to  new  available 
information.  The  revisions  increased  efficiencies  of  coke  ovens  and  blast 
furnaces and led to breaks between 2013 and 2014. 
Other bituminous coal production ceased in 2016 due to the closure of the one 
coal mine in 2015. 
Transformation 
Breaks  in  the  time  series  between  2014  and  2015  for  coke  oven  gas,  blast 
furnace  gas  and  other  recovered  gases  are  due  to  a  reclassification  of  main 
activity producers and autoproducers.

Prior  to  2009,  sub-bituminous  coal  used  in  main  activity  electricity  plants  was 
included with other bituminous coal consumption. 
For  data  since  2001,  calorific  values  for  imports  of  other  bituminous  coal  and 
sub-bituminous  coal  are  derived 
from 
inputs 
to  main  activity  electricity 
generation. 
Consumption 
In 1991, all industrial activities were reclassified on the basis of ISTAT/NACE 91. 
This has implied some transfers of activities which may result in some anomalies 
between 1991 and earlier years. 
Oil 
General notes  
For  crude  oil,  statistical  difference  may  arise  as  trade  corresponding  to  stock 
held for Austria and Germany in the Port of Trieste are not included.  
Inputs  to  electricity  and  heat  generation  have  been  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat  for  the  years  1984  to  1997  based  on  submissions  of  the  Electricity 
and  heat  Questionnaire.  All  other  data  for  the  years  1992  to  1997  and  the 
detailed consumption breakdown for other years have been estimated by the IEA 
Secretariat based on Bilancio Energetico Nazionale. 
Supply 
Due  to  an  improvement  of  reporting  by  the  Italian  administration,  indigenous 
production of NGL is reported separately from crude oil in 2020. 
Indigenous production of other hydrocarbons in 2020 is from the Gorgoglione 
field in Basilicata. 
In the 2021 edition, due to a new calculation methodology adopted by the Italian 
administration,  product  transfers  appear  for  the  first  time  in  2019  for  motor 
gasoline, kerosene type jet fuel, gas/diesel oil and fuel oil.  
In 2016 and 2017, the closure of the Val d’Agri oil centre lasting several months 
led to a decrease in production of crude oil. 
From  2009  onwards,  transfers  of  lubricants  could  not  be  disaggregated  from 
refinery output data.

From 2004 onwards, increased production of non-specified oil products is due 
to methodological changes.  
A  new  survey  to  determine  the  split  between  international  marine  bunkers  and 
domestic navigation caused a break in time series for gas/diesel oil in 1999 and 
fuel oil in 1996.  
Consumption 
Due  to  the  unavailability  of  data  at  the  time  of  reporting,  some  sectoral  2021p 
data  are  reported  combined  with  other  sectors,  which  may  result  in  breaks  in 
time series. 
For gas/diesel oil, non-specified use is included in commercial/public services.  
Between 1998 and 1999, due to new surveys, breaks appear in the consumption 
time series. 
Natural gas  
Supply 
In 2021, Exports increased substantially due to the TAP pipeline beginning 
operations. 
Transformation 
Prior  to  2008,  inputs  of  natural  gas  to  all  heat  production  in  industry  were 
reported in final consumption. 
Between  2003  and  2004  there  are  breaks  in  time  series  in  industry  and 
transformation due to a new data reporting methodology  
From  2000  to  2002,  for  confidentiality  reasons,  autoproducers  are  included  in 
main activity producer plants.  
In  1996  the  production  of  gas  works  gas  from  natural  gas  in  gas  works 
(transformation) ceased.  
Consumption 
In  the  2021  Edition,  following  a  new  source  of  data  and  a  change  of 
methodology,  the  flows  oil  and  gas  extraction  and  gas  inputs  to  oil  refineries 
were revised from 2011 onwards.

Since 2007, a more detailed breakdown of consumption for energy industry own 
use is available.  
Biofuels and waste 
Supply 
Biogasoline includes bio-ETBE. 
From  2014,  a  distinction  between  trade  and  production  became  available  for 
other liquid biofuels. 
Transformation 
In  2018,  a  new  biomethane  plant  was  installed  leading  to  increases  in  biogas 
blending with natural gas. 
2017 is the first year that biogas is blended with natural gas. 
In  2008,  data  for  biofuels  and  waste  were  reclassified,  which  results  in  several 
breaks in the time series for transformation. 
Consumption 
From  the  2018  data  onwards,  the  increase  in  biodiesel  demand  is  related  to 
blending obligations. 
The final consumption of biogas has been constant from 2013 to 2015, as these 
figures  are  the  result  of a  survey  which  is  not  carried  out  annually.  Figures  are 
expected to be revised after the next survey. 
In  the  2016  edition,  the  methodology  used  to  calculate  solid  biofuels 
consumption  in  the  residential  sector  for  2002  to  2014  was  updated  and  this 
created  a  break  in  time  series  between  2001  and  2002.  This  also  affects  the 
indigenous  production  of  solid  biofuels.  The  revisions  were  limited  backwards 
to 2002 because of reliability issues. 
Electricity and heat  
Supply 
For  2021,  electricity  output  from  autoproducer  wind  was  reported  for  the  first 
time in several years due to a reclassification of the producer type.

For  2017, more  information  became  available  on  fossil  fuel  use  in  heat plants 
allowing additional inputs to be reported for this category. This causes breaks in 
time series between 2016 and 2017.  
The production of electricity reported in the category other fuel sources refers to 
electricity  produced  from  turbines  which  are  located  at  pressure  drops  in  fluid 
transport. 
The  methodology  of  data  collection  for  photovoltaic  electricity  production 
changed  in  2009  and  the  distinction  between  main  activity  and  autoproducer 
plants could not be determined, causing a break in the time series. 
Due  to  the  aggregation  of  rounded  values,  from  2007-2016,  total  electricity 
output may differ slightly from the sum of the output from the individual fuels.  
Transformation 
For 2018, the decrease in electricity output from Solar PV was due to lower than 
solar radiation.  
Prior  to  2000,  electricity  used  for  pumped  storage  (mixed  plants)  is  included 
under used for pumped storage (pure hydro pumping plants). 
In  2016,  the  decline  in  autoproducer  electricity  generation  and  sold  heat 
production by oil refineries is partly due to the activities of these units being split 
off and reclassified as main activity enterprises. 
The methodology of data collection for the geothermal sector changed in 2010, 
causing a break in time series between 2009 and 2010. 
Prior  to  2009,  sub-bituminous  coal  used  in  main  activity  electricity  plants  was 
included under other bituminous coal. 
With  the  introduction  of  a  new  survey  in  2008,  amounts  of  naphtha  and  other 
kerosene that were previously included in other oil products have been reported 
separately in autoproducer CHP plants. 
Prior  to  2004,  electricity  production  from  orimulsion  is  confidential  and  is 
included with fuel oil. 
Heat  production  is  reported  starting  in  2004  and  includes  self-generation  in 
industry. 
From  2000  onwards,  the  Italian  administration  defines  electricity  and  heat 
production from autoproducers as generation from producers that consume more

than  70%  of  their  own  electricity  production.  However,  for  the  2000  to  2002 
period, all electricity production from autoproducers is reported with main activity 
producers. 
The breakdown of renewables and waste inputs into electricity, heat and CHP 
plants  is  available  from  1989  only.  Prior  to  that  year,  the  total  of  the  different 
fuels involved is reported as non-specified renewables. 
Prior  to  1984,  net  electricity  production  by  autoproducers  includes  production 
from combustible fuel sources only. 
Consumption 
For the 2021 edition, the Italian Administration changed system of reporting used 
to  categorise  consumption  based  on  economic  activity  (from  ATECUE95  to 
ATECO2007).  As  a  result,  breaks  in  series  occur  between  2018  and  2019. 
Historical revisions are pending. 
Some  breaks  in-series  for  heat  consumption  are  observed  between  2017  and 
2018. This is because some large heat producers reported consumption of heat 
in 2018 in sectors different to those they had reported in previous years.  
Non-specified  energy  industry  own  use  includes  electricity  consumption  for 
blast  furnaces.  From  2000,  it  also  includes  consumption  for  the  distribution  of 
gas and prior to 1989 consumption for uranium extraction. 
The  breakdown  of  heat  consumption  by  sector  is  estimated  by  the  Italian 
administration. 
Revisions  of  the  final  consumption  of  heat  by  the  Italian  administration  led  to 
breaks between 2010 and 2011. 
From  1981,  consumption  of  electricity  in  transport  includes  electricity  used  for 
pumping in oil pipelines.

General notes 
In  the  2019  edition,  data  for  Japan  were  revised  back  to  1990  based  on  new 
methodology. Additional details are given under each fuel. 
From  1990,  data  are  reported  on  a  fiscal  year  basis  (e.g. April  2015  to  March 
2016 for 2015).  
Consumption  data  for  commercial/public  services  may  include  consumption  in 
small  and  medium-sized  industries.  The  Japanese  administration  expects  that 
this shortcoming will be corrected in the near future.  
Coal 
General notes 
Other bituminous coal includes sub-bituminous coal. 
The  net calorific  values for  coal  and  coal  products  have  been recalculated  by 
the IEA Secretariat based upon gross values submitted by Japan.  
In  the  2019  edition,  imports  of  other  bituminous  coal  and  coking  coal  –by 
partner country - have been estimated by the IEA Secretariat for data from 1990 
to 2018, based on customs data and total imports by coal type. 
Hard coal data prior to 1978 may include sub-bituminous coal. 
Supply 
In the 2020, revisions were made by the Japanese administration to the imports 
of other bituminous coal for the years 1991, 2015 and 2017. 
Statistical  differences  for  hard  coal  include  stock  changes  since  2001.  Large 
positive differences for several years since 2004 are partly due to stock build by 
final consumers.

Transformation 
The inputs of coke oven coke to blast furnaces as well as the final consumption 
of coke oven coke in the iron and steel industry have been estimated by the IEA 
Secretariat since 1990. 
From 1998, inputs of coke oven gas, blast furnace gas and other recovered 
gases  into  autoproducer  electricity  plants  include  the  amount  used  to  produce 
electricity  with  TRT  technology  (Top  pressure  Recovery  Turbines)  which  was 
previously included in industry. 
Inputs  of  manufactured  gases  (coke  oven  gas,  blast  furnace  gas  and  other 
recovered  gases)  to  main  activity  electricity  and  heat  plants  are  calculated 
based  on  outputs  and  using  efficiencies  of  main  activity  producers  from  other 
fuels.  For  autoproducers,  the  specific  inputs  are  known,  however  the  specific 
electricity  production  by  each  gas  is  estimated  based  on  a  pro-rata  of  the  total 
electricity generation from all gas types. 
Coal injected in blast furnaces (PCI) is classified as coking coal in order to be 
consistent with Japanese trade statistics. 
In  2016  the  liberation  of  the  power  market  resulted  in  electricity  autoproducers 
becoming main activity producers. 
Consumption 
In  the  2020  edition,  anthracite  consumption  in  agriculture/forestry  has  been 
revised. 
In  the  2020  edition,  after  investigation  by  the  Japanese  administration  the  coal 
tar previously reported under total final consumption in the chemical sector has 
been reallocated under the category non-energy use. 
In  the  2019  edition  coal  tar  consumption  in  the  chemical  and  petrochemical 
industry was estimated by the IEA since 1990. 
Oil 
General notes 
In the 2021 edition, data for Japan were revised back to 1990 by the Japanese 
administration based on new methodology for the Energy Balance Table.

In  the  2021  edition,  the  Japanese  administration  revised  several  NCVs  of  both 
primary  and  secondary  oil  products  back  to  1990  as  a  result  of  improved 
calculation methods. The Japanese administration reviews calorific values every 
five years. 
In the 2020 edition, data for Japan were revised back to 1990 by the Japanese 
administration based on new methodology and coverage for the Energy Balance 
Table. The revisions mainly concern the demand side (in particular, consumption 
in  road  transport  and  chemical  industry),  resulting  in  improved  statistical 
difference in the time series. 
In the 2019 edition, data for Japan were revised back to 1990 by the Japanese 
administration based on new methodology for the Energy Balance Table.  
In  the  2016  edition,  the  Japanese  administration  revised  several  NCVs  of  both 
primary and secondary oil products back to 1990. The Japanese administration 
reviews  calorific  values  every  five  years,  with  the  other  most  recent  revisions 
occurring in 2005 and in 2013. 
Supply 
In 2018 refinery runs were impacted by heavier than usual maintenance season.  
The  high  statistical  difference  for  crude  oil  in  2013  and  2014  is  explained  by 
large amount of stocks held on board incoming vessels in port or at mooring in 
March 2014 (end of Japan’s 2013 financial year). These amounts are included in 
the stock change but not in the imports in 2013 annual data. 
Orimulsion was imported for electricity generation between 1991 and 2006. 
Transformation 
Other hydrocarbons in non-specified transformation represents orimulsion burnt 
for power generation. Historical revisions are pending. 
In  2016 
the 
liberalisation  of 
the  power  market  resulted 
in  electricity 
autoproducers becoming main activity producers. 
Consumption 
Due to the data being in fiscal years, the impact of COVID-19 is visible in 2019 
as  oil  consumption  in  some  sectors  decreased  between  January  and  March 
2020.

Oil  consumption  continued  to  fall  in  2018  as  more  nuclear  capacity  came  back 
online.  
Demand  for  heating  oil  and  other  kerosene  fell  driven  by  a  warmer  than  usual 
winter in 2018.  
Road consumption, is based on the “Automobile fuel consumption survey” from 
the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT).  
Lubricants  consumption  is  estimated  by  the  Japanese  administration  since 
2000. 
Natural gas  
General notes 
The 2022 edition contains minor revisions to time series which go back to 1990 
for  imports  and  stock  levels.  These  reflect  the  revisions  in  the  Energy  Balance 
Table  from  the  Ministry  of  Economy,  Trade  and  Industry,  which  is  the  data 
source. 
The 2019 edition contains major revisions to time series which go back to 1990. 
These  reflect  the  revisions  in  the  Energy  Balance  Table  from  the  Ministry  of 
Economy, Trade and Industry, which is the data source. 
Since  1990  most  of  the gas works  gas  production  and  consumption  has  been 
included with natural gas. 
Supply 
In  the  2019  edition,  indigenous  production,  receipts  from  other  sources,  import 
data, stock changes and stock levels were revised back to 1990. 
Transformation 
In the 2019 edition, main activity and autoproducer electricity plants were revised 
back to 1990. Similarly, flows of the energy sector were revised back up to 1990. 
Consumption 
In  the  2019  edition,  own  consumption  in  electricity,  CHP  and  heat  plants  was 
subject to a major revision since 1990.

In  the  2019  edition,  all  the  transport  sector,  industry  sector  and  other  sectors 
flows were revised back to 1990. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
In  the  2019  edition,  data  for  Japan  were  revised  back  to  1990  based  on  new 
methodology.  
There  was  a  large  revision  in  municipal waste data  in  the  2016  edition  of this 
publication.  This  revision  has  removed  data  for  municipal waste  for  the  entire 
time series up to 2010. 
For  municipal  waste  data,  the  breakdown  between  renewable  and  non-
renewable  municipal  waste  is  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  assuming  a 
50% split in transformation and supply. 
Transformation 
Input  data  of  solid  biofuels  to  charcoal  production  are  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat assuming an efficiency of 40%. 
The  industrial  waste  consumption  in  the  non-specified  transformation  sector 
surged  in  2013,  because  of  the  increase  in  use  of  waste  plastics  for  coke 
production. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply 
In  the  2019  edition,  electricity  data  were  revised  back  to  1990  to  include 
additional autoproducer production previously excluded.  
Due to the liberalisation of the electricity market in April 2016 some generation 
previously  reported  under  autoproducer  plants  is  reported  as  main  activity 
producer from 2016 onwards. As a result, breaks in series occur between 2015 
and 2016. In particular, for solar PV and wind. 
In  the  2019  edition,  the  methodology  used  to  estimate  heat  production  from 
other sources was revised. 
Generation  of  electricity  and  heat  from  combustible  fuels  is  calculated  by 
removing electricity and heat generation from other sources, such as wind, solar

and nuclear, making it a residual item. Splits between combustible fuel types and 
consumption flows are also calculated. 
Due  to  the  events  related  to  the  March  2011  tsunami,  the  Japanese 
administration decided to scale back the level of their nuclear programme. As a 
consequence,  there  was  no  nuclear  electricity  generation  in  2014.  The  nuclear 
electricity  generation  started  again  at  a  greatly  reduced  scale  in  2015,  while 
significant increases were observed in 2017 and 2018, with generation resuming 
at  several  facilities  (2017:  Takahama 3  and  4,  Ooi  3,  and  Genkai  3;  2018: 
Genkai 4, Ikata 3, Ooi 4). In 2020, output decreased due to inspections at some 
plants. 
Other sources electricity represents electricity generated with purchased steam. 
Other sources heat represents heat derived from waste heat.  
Net  and  gross  electricity  generation  from  autoproducers  are  equal,  as  no 
information is collected concerning autoproducer own use.  
Own use at main electricity plants has been constant since 2015, as data are no 
longer available following liberalisation. 
Data  for  electric  boilers  include  heat  pumps.  For  this  reason,  calculated 
efficiencies exceed 100% for some years. 
Autoproducer  solar  photovoltaic  capacity  is  derived  from  data  from  the 
Japanese  administration  as  well  as  the  IEA  Photovoltaic  Power  Systems 
Programme  (IEA-PVPS)  report,  “Trends  in  Photovoltaic  Applications”  published 
in 2019.  
Data on electricity production from wind began in 1992. 
Heat produced for sale in main activity producer heat plants from waste heat and 
from electric boilers is available from 1977 and 1983, respectively. 
Transformation 
The Japanese Administrations attributes heat outputs (with the exception of heat 
from electric boilers) to individual fuels based on their share of inputs, assuming 
efficiencies are 100% or less. As a result, fuel-specific transformation efficiencies 
may not reflect actual efficiencies. 
Data on heat produced for sale by autoproducer heat plants are not available. 
Fuels  used  and  corresponding  electricity  and  heat  produced  in  CHP  plants  are 
not  included  in  the  CHP  data time  series,  but  instead  are reported  as  separate

electricity  or  heat  components,  leading  to  some  plant  efficiency  figures  not  to 
be accurately calculated. 
Inputs  of  biofuels  and  waste  for  electricity  production  and  related  outputs  are 
available from 1982. 
Net  electricity  production  by  autoproducers  prior  to  1982  includes  production 
from combustible fuel sources only. 
Between 1972 and 1976, the use of combustible fuels in main activity producer 
heat plants is included in non-specified. 
Consumption 
In  the  2020  edition,  there  are  revisions  in  the  consumption  of  solar  thermal  in 
the commercial and public services and residential sectors in 1990 - 2004. 
Consumption  of  electricity  in  non-specified  industry  includes  wood  and  wood 
products and construction prior to 1982.

Korea 
Sources 
Korea Energy Economics Institute, Ulsan. 
Korea National Oil Corporation, Ulsan. 
General notes 
Data are available starting in 1971.  
Data for 2002 onwards have been reported on a different basis, causing breaks 
in  time  series  between  2001  and  2002,  especially  for  inputs  and  outputs  to 
electricity generation and consumption in the iron and steel industry. The Korean 
administration  is  planning  to  revise  the  historical  time  series  as  time  and 
resources allow. 
Coal  
General notes 
Data  for  coal  and  coal  products  from  1971  to  2001  are  based  on  information 
provided by the Korean administration, as well as information from the Yearbook 
of  Energy  Statistics  2002,  the  Yearbook  of  Coal  Statistics  2001  (both  from  the 
Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy), and Statistics of Electric Power in 
Korea  2001  (from  the  Korea  Electric  Power  Corporation).  During  this  period, 
import  data  by  coal  type  were  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat,  based  on 
statistics of the exporting countries. 
Hard coal data prior to 1978 may include sub-bituminous coal. 
Transformation 
Statistical  differences for manufactured  gases for  2012  are  partly the  result  of 
classification  issues. The  Korean  administration is  working  to  improve  reporting 
of coal-derived gases production and consumption. 
Consumption 
In  the  anthracite  balance,  the  category  Non-specified  (Industry)  includes 
manufacture  of  cement,  lime,  plaster  and  its  products,  and  small  businesses. 
Currently the breakdown of those is not available.

The consumption of other bituminous coal in the Food, beverages and tobacco 
industry stopped in 2018. 
Data  on  blast  furnace gas  used for  energy  purposes  in  blast furnaces prior to 
2007 are reported in the iron and steel industry. 
Consumption  of  imported  coke  oven  coke  starting  in  2002  is  reported  under 
non-specified industry. 
Consumption  of  manufactured  gases  in  the  iron  and  steel  industry  starting  in 
2002  includes  the  consumption  in  blast  furnaces,  oxygen  steel  furnaces  and 
other iron and steel processing plants. 
Oil  
Supply 
There are breaks in transfers of several oil products in 2020 owing to a change 
in the reporting methodology of a refinery that expanded its chemical plant.  
The  production  of  heavy  distillates  has  been  declining  due  to  the  expansion  of 
heavy oil upgrading facilities.  
In  2017,  due  to  constraints  to  imports  of  condensate,  Korean  refineries  used 
naphtha into the refinery process.  
From 1997, stock levels include vessel stocks.  
Transformation 
Inputs of fuel oil to autoproducer electricity and autoproducer CHP are included 
with final consumption. 
Consumption 
Due to the change in the reporting methodology of a refinery, some breaks may 
appear  between  2019  and  2020,  in  particular  for  consumption  in  Chemical 
(including petrochemical) industry. 
From  1990  to  1995,  kerosene  type  jet  fuel  split  between  international  civil 
aviation and domestic air transport has been estimated.

Natural gas 
Supply 
Since  2013,  receipts  from  other  sources  –  oil  is  estimated  using  the  histrorical 
relationship with the Oil Questionnaire and extrapolating. 
Korea reports production of natural gas since 2005.  
The receipts from other sources from 2006 to 2012 represent the amount of LPG 
that  are  either  blended  with  natural  gas  or  are  directly  used  in  city  gas 
distribution networks. 
Consumption  
Energy  industry  own  use  in  liquefaction  plants  includes  losses  and  measuring 
errors. 
Prior  to  2007,  consumption  of  natural  gas  in  machinery  was  included  with 
transport equipment. 
From 1987 to 1991, the breakdown of final consumption has been estimated by 
the IEA Secretariat, as well as the residential subsector for 1992. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
Due  to  the  change  of  reporting  methodology,  breaks  in  time  series  may  occur 
between 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. 
Heat data are available starting in 1993. 
Transformation 
Inputs  to  autoproducer  heat  plants  have  been  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat 
because of efficiency issues for municipal waste prior to 2011 and in 2012 and 
for biogas in 2008, 2011 and 2012. 
New plants were included in the Korean survey creating breaks in time series in 
2011. 
In  2007,  some  main  activity  heat  plants  and  autoproducers 
in 
the 
commercial/public services sector were reclassified as main activity CHP plants, 
resulting in a break in the time series between 2006 and 2007 for biogases.

Electricity and heat  
General notes 
Electricity statistics from 1971 to 1993 have been estimated by the IEA Secretariat 
based on the Korean National Statistics. Data from 1994 have been submitted by 
the Korean administration. This leads to breaks in time series between 1993 and 
1994. 
Supply 
The own use of heat in heat plants is very irregular due to a lack of data. 
Electricity generation reported under other sources is from fuel cells. 
Production of tidal electricity began in 2013. 
Data for heat from chemical processes that is sold are available from 2008. 
Data  for  electricity  production  using  heat  from  chemical  processes  in  copper 
and  zinc  plants  are  available  from  2005.  The  corresponding  heat  inputs  were 
estimated  until  2013  data.  In  2014, the  company  concerned  switched  to  diesel 
oil for electricity generation. 
Transformation 
For 2020, the increase in electricity output from nuclear was due to the 1.4 GW 
reactor (Singori #4) coming online, as well as higher utilisation rates. For 2018, 
the  decrease  in  electricity  output  from  nuclear  was  due  to  a  combination  of 
shutdowns  for maintenance,  and the  closure  of the  Kori  and Wolseong nuclear 
power plants in June 2017 and June 2018 respectively. 
For  2018,  the  increase  in  heat  production  from  natural  gas  was  in  part  due  to 
two  CHP  plants 
the  commencement  and  expansion  of  operations  at 
(Hwaseong Dongtan and Anyang).  
For 2017, the decrease in electricity production from residual fuel oil is due to 
the closure of two main activity producer plants. 
Some  discrepancies  exist  between  data reported for  residual fuel  oil  in  the  oil 
databases  and  the  electricity  and  heat  databases.  The  Korean  administration 
hopes to remedy this situation in a coming cycle. 
Prior to 2009, autoproducer heat production includes amounts of unsold heat.

Data for electricity and heat production by autoproducers using natural gas and 
liquid fuels are available from 2000. 
In 2000, the Korean administration started to report heat statistics for some heat 
plants which were not reported before. 
Between  1993  and  1999,  the  breakdown  of  heat  output  by  type  of  fuel  was 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
Before  1994,  electricity  production  from  main  activity  producer  CHP  plants  is 
included with main activity producer electricity-only plants. 
Consumption 
Data  for  direct  use  of  geothermal  heat  are  available  from  2002.  Geothermal 
direct use data are overstated as it refers to heat production by geothermal heat 
pumps,  which  include  inputs  of  electricity  and/or  gas  in  the  transformation 
process. 
Heat consumption by subsector was reclassified in 2010 due to new information 
available on heat sales from autoproducers to end-users by sector. 
Prior to 2008, sales of electricity by Korea’s main electricity distributor, KEPCO, 
to the non-ferrous metals sector are included in iron and steel consumption. 
Data on production and consumption of electricity and heat in oil refineries and 
LNG  liquefaction/regasification  plants  are  included  in  the  industry  sector.  From 
2007, oil refinery electricity and heat production and consumption started to be 
reported under the correct energy sector. 
Data for heat consumption by sector are available from 2000. 
Data for electricity consumption in the transport equipment sector are included 
in machinery from 1994 to 1999.

Latvia 
Source 
Central Statistical Bureau, Riga. 
General notes 
Data for Latvia are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included in 
Former Soviet Union in the publication World Energy Statistics. 
Breaks  in  the  time  series  appear  for  inputs  to  and  outputs  from  electricity 
generation  between  2016  and  2017  due  to  a  change  in  methodology.  This  is 
most  notable  for  main  activity  producer  CHP  and  Heat  plants.  Data  for  2017 
onwards  are  reported  on  a  unit  basis,  whereas  data  for  previous  years  are 
reported on a plant basis. 
Coal  
Supply 
The increase of distribution losses for peat in 2003 is due to a fire in one of the 
warehouses. 
Consumption 
The  drop  in  the  iron  and  steel  industry  in  2014  is  due  to  the  bankruptcy  of  the 
major company in the market. 
Oil 
Supply 
Other hydrocarbons data represent shale oil. 
In  2020,  changes  in  the  national  legislation  mandated  an  increase  in  the 
minimum blending of biofuels. 
In 2018, amendments to the legislation mandated a biofuel blending target of at 
least  4.5%  of  volume  for  gas/diesel  oil  used  in  temperate  and  severe  winter 
conditions  leading  respectively  to  an  increase  of  its  consumption  for  road 
transport.

In  2018  one  of  the  main  players  in  marine  bunkering  at  Latvia’s  largest  port 
ceased  operations.  As  a  result  deliveries  of  oil  products  to  marine  bunkers 
decreased in that year. As of 2019 the issues have been resolved and bunkering 
activity has resumed. 
Consumption 
In  2020,  consumption  of  LPG  in  fishing  is  reported  for  the  first  time  as  a 
company changed its type of activity from NACE 1020 to NACE 0311. 
Consumption of LPG and bitumen in mining/quarrying are reported for the first 
time as an asphalt concrete plant started operating in 2020. 
Natural gas 
Consumption 
The  consumption  in  the  iron  and  steel  industry  decreased  in  2014  due  to  the 
bankruptcy of the major company in the market.  
Transformation 
In  2017  there  was  a  steep  decrease/break  reported  in  main  activity  producer 
CHP consumption and a respective increase/break in main activity producer heat 
consumption  due  to  the  classification  of  natural  gas  inputs  according  to  the 
individual units of the plants instead of the plants as a whole that was previously 
used. 
Biofuels and waste 
Supply 
For 2018 data, the increase in the indigenous production of solid biofuels is due 
to wood pellet production. 
In  2017,  a  biodiesel  producer  exported  amounts  produced  in  2017  and  also 
some amounts from stocks. 
Transformation 
Due  to  a  reclassification  in  2004,  there  was  break  in  time  series  of  electricity 
production  from  autoproducer  electricity  plant  fuelled  by  biogas  between  2003 
and 2004.

Consumption 
The  increase  in  consumption  of  solid  biofuels  in  not  elsewhere  specified 
(industry) in 2018 is related to increases in the manufacture of furniture sector. 
The  increase  in  inland  consumption  of  biodiesel  in  2018  data  is  related  to  the 
implementation of favourable legislation (the “Biofuel Law”).  
The increase in supply for solid biofuels from 2016 to 2017 is due to increased 
usage in the industry sector.  
From  2014,  biodiesel  consumption  has  been  decreasing  due  to  policies  which 
support the sale of arctic diesel fuel without renewable additives. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply 
In  2019,  the  first  large-scale  main  activity  solar  thermal  district  heating  plant 
opened in Latvia. 
For  2017,  higher  rainfall  resulted  in  a  significant  increase  in  electricity  output 
from  hydro,  and  a  decrease  in  both  imports  of  electricity  and  output  from 
combustible fuels. 
Heat  production  from  other  sources  represents  waste  heat  recovered  from 
industry, and heat produced by condensing economisers. 
Transformation 
From 2012 onwards, the increase in electricity production from solid biofuels is 
due to the deployment of six new main activity producer CHP plants running on 
wood chips.  
Consumption 
Prior  to  2018  data,  electricity  consumed  by  trams  at  one  of  Latvia’s  three  tram 
operators was included under road.  
For  2012,  the  increase  in  electricity  consumption  in  the  iron  and  steel  sector  is 
due to a facility switching from an open hearth furnace to an electric arc furnace.

Lithuania 
Source 
Statistics Lithuania, Vilnius. 
General notes 
Data for Lithuania are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included 
in Former Soviet Union in the publication World Energy Statistics. 
Oil 
Supply 
In  2020,  changes  in  the  national  legislation  mandated  an  increase  in  the 
minimum blending of biofuels.  
Natural gas 
Supply 
The  export  quantities  since  2014  represent  imported  LNG  which  is  regasified 
and subsequently exported to other countries.  
Transformation 
Not  elsewhere  specified  (transformation)  data  represent  natural  gas  used  for 
methanol manufacture, which is used as input in oil refineries. 
Consumption 
Natural  gas  consumption  for  power  generation  has  been  falling  significantly 
from  2010  onwards  as  gas-fired  power  and  heating  plants  are  being  retired, 
largely replaced by biomass. 
There is a break between 2010 and 2011 in the not elsewhere specified (energy) 
timeseries due to natural gas being consumed for heat that was used to destroy 
radioactive waste after the decommissioning of the only Lithuanian nuclear plant 
at the end of 2009.

Biofuels and waste 
Supply 
In  2019,  the  increase  in  the  indigenous  production  of  industrial  waste  (non-
renewable) is the result of increased data availability. 
The  production  of  charcoal  has  been  over-estimated  prior  to  2017  due  to  the 
fact that it was not possible to report data less than 1 kt. 
Starting  from  2016,  some  industrial  waste  (renewable)  was  collected  via 
sorting. These wastes consist of non-recyclable paper, textiles and wood wastes 
and their production is included in solid biofuels. 
Transformation 
The  Fortum  Klaipėda  CHP  plant  produces  electricity  and  heat  from  industrial 
waste (non-renewable), municipal waste and solid biofuels since the end of 
2013.  Since  its  inception,  structural  optimisation  has  been  sought.  Additionally, 
before  2016,  calorific  values  of  the  fuels  were  calculated  by  taking  samples  of 
fuels  and  after  this  period,  calculations  were  made  from  steam.  For  these 
reasons,  there  are  fluctuations  in  fuel  inputs,  energy  production  and  fuel  ratios 
between  industrial  waste  (non-renewable),  municipal  waste  and  solid 
biofuels since 2013. 
In  2013,  an  incinerator  combusting  industrial  waste  (non-renewable)  and 
municipal waste began operations.  
Electricity and heat 
Transformation 
In  2009,  the  Ignalina  nuclear  power  plant,  the  only  nuclear  plant  in  Lithuania, 
closed down. 
In March 2017, the Geoterma geothermal heat plant, the only geothermal heat 
plant in Lithuania, closed down.

Coal  
General notes 
For  the  2011  edition, the  Luxembourgian  administration  revised  the time  series 
from  2000  for  most  coal  and  coal  products.  Time  series  for  BKB  consumption 
were revised from 1990. 
Prior to 1978, some sub-bituminous coal may be included in hard coal. 
Steel production from blast furnaces ceased at the end of 1997. 
Oil 
Consumption 
In the  late  1970s, the  reduction  in  consumption of fuel  oil  in  the  iron  and  steel 
industry was due to substitution by coal. 
Natural gas 
General notes 
In 1982 there is a break in the time series in transformation and industry due to a 
change in methodology. 
Transformation 
In  the  2017  edition  a main  activity  producer  CHP  plant  was  reclassified as  one 
main activity electricity producer plant and one main activity producer heat plant. 
Data were revised back to 2014. 
Since  2002,  the  increase  in  the  transformation  sector  is  due  to  a  new  350-MW 
combined cycle power plant. 
The last main activity producer electricity gas-consuming plant closed in 2016.

Consumption 
In  2015,  Luxembourg  integrated  supplementary  data  from  ETS  companies  and 
industrial consumption was revised back to the year 2000. 
The  breakdown  of  total  final  consumption  for  the  latest  year  is  preliminary  and 
will be finalised in the next edition of the book. 
Since  2012,  the  methodology  to  determine  final  consumption  was  changed  in 
order to integrate basic data from National Accounts. 
Since  2000,  a  more  detailed  breakdown  of  final  consumption  data  is  available 
due to a change in methodology. 
Since 2000, consumption in the non-ferrous metals sub-sector is included in iron 
and steel for reasons of confidentiality. 
Since 2000 consumption in not elsewhere specified (Industry) includes activity of 
companies reclassified to preserve the confidentiality. 
Prior 
to 
2000, 
residential 
consumption 
includes 
consumption 
in 
commercial/public services and agriculture/forestry. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
The Luxembourgian administration started including trade figure of wood chips in 
trade figure of solid biofuels from 2015 data. This creates breaks in time series 
between 2014 and 2015. 
Data on solid biofuels are available from 1992. 
Supply 
There was a fire at the co-digestion plant Itzig in September 2018. The plant was 
not  reopened  until  October  2019,  causing  a  decrease  in  biogas  production 
(specifically: other biogases from anaerobic fermentation). 
Transformation 
In the end of 2018, there was a fire in one of the main biogas plants and it has 
been off for most of 2019. The most notable effect has been on biogas blending. 
In 2011, the blending of biogases with natural gas started.

Electricity and heat 
General notes 
Data for solar thermal are available starting in 2001 and for solar PV starting in 
2000. 
A  revision  in  the  classification  of  power  plants  by  type  and  the  production  and 
consumption  data for  both  electricity  and  heat  back to  2000  causes  breaks  in 
the time series.  
Supply 
Most of the hydro production shown for Luxembourg is from the Vianden pumped 
storage plant and is exported directly to Germany. 
There  were  some  repairs  on  the  upper  basin  of  the  pumped  storage  site  at 
Vianden in 2019 leading to a reduction in electricity production. The full storage 
capacity was not available during this period. 
In  the  2017  edition,  following  plant  reclassification,  heat  production  by  main 
activity plants was revised from 2011 onwards. 
Starting  in  2005,  data  for  electricity  transmission  and  distribution  losses  were 
obtained  from  the  network  operator.  Prior  to  that,  they  were  estimated  by  the 
Luxembourgian administration. 
For  Main  CHP,  own  use  data  are  not  available  for  solid  biofuels-  or  natural 
gas-fired plants. 
Transformation 
A natural gas fired, main activity electricity plant (TGV Twinerg) closed in 2016. 
The  production  of  electricity  from  solid  biofuels  from  2013  corresponds  to  the 
opening of a new plant burning wood wastes. 
Data  on  electricity  production from  biogases  are  available  from  1998  and  heat 
production from 2010. 
In  2002,  the  increase  in  electricity  production  is  due  to  a  new  natural  gas 
combined cycle power plant. 
At the end of 1997, the iron and steel industry stopped production of electricity.

Electricity data for natural gas autoproducer CHP plants are available starting in 
1995, and for main activity CHP plants starting in 1996. 
Prior  to  1990,  net  electricity  production  by  autoproducers  includes  production 
from combustible fuel sources only. 
Consumption 
Heat  consumption  in  industry  is  estimated  based  on  National  Accounts.  When 
not  available,  heat  consumption  figures  for  the  most  recent  year  reported  are 
estimated based on data for the preceding year. 
In  2015,  the  observed  declines  in  the  heat  used  in the textiles  and  leather  and 
chemical  and  petrochemical  sectors  lead  to  the  closure  of  two  industrial  main 
CHP  plants.  The  heating  needs  of  these  sectors  were  met  through  direct 
purchase of natural gas, due in part to attractive pricing during this period.  
In 2015, following the procurement of new information, data for heat distribution 
losses and heat consumption in industry and energy sectors were revised from 
2000 onwards. 
A  change  in  the  data  source  caused  some  breaks  in  the  industry  electricity 
consumption time series between 2010 and 2011. 
The breakdown of electricity consumption in industry is not available from 1990 
to 1999.

Mexico 
Source 
Secretaría de Energía, Mexico City. 
General notes 
Data are available starting in 1971.  
The Mexican administration submitted data directly by questionnaire for the first 
time with 1992 data. As a result, some breaks in time series may occur between 
1991  and  1992.  For  prior  years,  data  are  partly  estimated  based  on  the 
publication Balance Nacional - Energía.  
In  the  2016  edition,  the  Mexican  administration  completed  a  major  work  on 
revisions  of  the  time  series  back  to  1990.  Revisions  for  some  products  include 
reporting  of  new  consumption  flows,  increased  quantities  of  coal  and  higher 
calorific values, resulting in increases of total primary energy supply. 
Coal 
General notes 
The  time  series  for  blast  furnace  gas  and  inputs  of  coke  oven  coke  to  blast 
furnaces start in 1991. 
Hard coal data prior to 1978 may include sub-bituminous coal.  
Supply 
Many  coal  mining  units  reduced  production  during  2019,  specifically  mines  in 
Coahuilla  (the  largest  coal  producer  state).  This  is  reflected  in  the  production 
figures of coking coal and sub-bituminous coal. 
Imports  by  country  of  origin  for  other  bituminous  coal  and  coking  coal  for  2016 
have been estimated by the IEA Secretariat, based on partner data. 
Blast furnace gas production and consumption have been estimated by the IEA 
for 1990 to 2017 based on inputs of coke oven coke to blast furnaces.

Coke  oven  coke  production  was  estimated  by  the  IEA for  some  years  between 
1999  and  2012  based  off  historical  and  commodities  data,  as  were  inputs  of 
coking coal to coke ovens between 1990 and 2012. 
The methodology currently used by Mexico to estimate production of coal tar and 
coke oven gas for recent years uses coke oven coke production as a guide. This 
was extended to the time series from 1990 to 2001, and to the years where coke 
oven coke production was estimated by the IEA. 
Consumption 
The  category  Non-specified  (Industry)  in  the  coking  coal  balance  includes  the 
industries  of  transport  equipment,  chemical,  food  and  glass.  Disaggregated 
values are not available. 
Use  of  pulverised  coal  injection  in  blast  furnaces  occurs  in  Mexico,  but  is  not 
currently reported. 
Oxygen steel furnace gas production and production of other recovered gases 
occur as by-products of heavy industry, but are not reported. 
For  coking  coal,  amounts  reported  for  consumption  in  main  activity  electricity 
generation  and  associated  imports  for  the  years  2003  to  2016  have  been 
reallocated to other bituminous coal by the IEA Secretariat.  
Oil 
General notes 
In  the  2022  edition,  data  from  2018  onwards  are  partly-estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat  based  on  the  Monthly  Oil  Statistics  and  the  Mexican  Secretaría  de 
Energía (SENER) national energy balance. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  2018  and  2019  data  are  partly-estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat  based  on  the  Monthly  Oil  Statistics  and  the  Mexican  Secretaría  de 
Energía (SENER) national energy balance. 
In the 2016 edition, major revisions were carried by the Ministry of Energy on the 
time series back to 1990 based on updated information available from PEMEX, 
the  Mexican  Institute  of  Petroleum  and  the  Federal  Electricity  Commission 
(CFE).  Revisions 
include  notably  crude  production,  refinery  output,  gas 
separation plant production, autoproducer generation and road consumption.

New  data  reported  as  additives  from  1990  correspond  to  methyl  tertiary  butyl 
ether. 
From  1993,  data  for  production  from  other  sources  (natural  gas)  of  other 
hydrocarbons  correspond  to  hydrogen  used  at  the  Minatitlan  refinery,  also 
represented as the output of non-specified transformation in the balances format. 
The split between domestic and international aviation consumption of kerosene-
type jet fuel is not available. By default, all kerosene-type jet fuel consumption is 
reported under international aviation. 
Supply 
In 2017 Minatitlán refinery was offline for several months and later operating well 
below capacity as a result of an accident on site. The refinery at Tula was also 
temporarily offline. Both these events impact refinery throughput in 2018.  
Refinery intake of crude oil was estimated by the IEA Secretariat for the years 
2016,  2017  and  2018  based  on  growth  rates  from  SENER  and  PEMEX 
published data.  
In 2017, production of crude oil and NGL was impacted by heavy maintenance 
at the Ku-Maloob-Zaap field and decline at the Cantarell field in the Gulf Mexico 
which was affected by several force majeur events.  
For  2017  import  data  of  LPG,  naphtha,  road  diesel  and  fuel  oil,  the  received 
data  was  supplemented  with  estimates  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on 
published data from SENER.  
2017  and  2018  imports  of  petroleum  coke  were  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat based on information from the U.S. Energy Information Agency.  
From  2016  onwards  trade  information  is  based  on  daily  customs  data  now 
available to the Ministry of Energy. Historical revisions are pending.  
The  large  refinery  losses  from  2005  onwards  are  the  result  of  the  downward 
revisions to refinery output of gas/diesel oil carried out in 2017.  
NGL  production  reported  in  the  IEA  publications  may  be  different  from  what  is 
reported  in  the  Mexican  energy  publications  as  the  IEA  includes  in  its  oil  data 
liquids produced in conjunction with natural gas. 
In the 2016 edition, main revisions were carried to NGL, LPG, naphtha, ethane 
supply. New data became available on input of NGL to refineries prior to 2011. 
Data  on  ethane  production  from  gas  separation  plants  (positive  transfers  from

NGL)  was  revised  upwards  for  1990  to  1998.  LPG  gas  separation  plant 
production was revised down. Naphtha refinery output was revised upwards from 
1990.  
Transformation 
For  several  months  in  2017,  the  Salina  Cruz  refinery  was  under  extensive 
maintenance following operational problems and structural damage as a result of 
the September 2017 earthquake.  
The Madero refinery closed for maintenance in August 2017 and remained close 
through the start of 2018.  
2017 refinery gross output of gas/diesel oil, bitumen, lubricants and paraffin 
waxes  was  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on  SENER  and  PEMEX 
published data. 
In  the  2016  edition,  data  for  crude  oil  refinery  input  and  refinery  output  of 
gas/diesel, naphtha, refinery gas, bitumen, paraffin wax and other products 
were revised back to 1990 (see general notes). 
Data  for  fuel  oil  and  gas/diesel  inputs  to  autoproducer  CHP  generation  are 
available from 1999.  
In 2003, a new facility was added to a refinery to produce petroleum coke. 
Consumption 
2017  consumption  of  naphtha  for  feedstock  purposes  in  the  chemical  and 
petrochemical  sector  was  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on  ethylene 
production figures.  
Consumption of motor gasoline and road diesel was impacted by changes to 
fuel subsidies introduced on January 1, 2017.  
Consumption  of  lubricants  and  bitumen  for  2017  was  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat based on sales data from SENER.  
In 
the  2016  edition,  naphtha  non-energy  use  consumption 
in 
the 
chemical/industry  was  revised  significantly  revised  down  from  1990  to  2008 
based on PEMEX information. 
In  the  2016  edition,  gas/diesel  and  motor  gasoline  road  consumption  data 
were  revised  back  to  1990  based  on  updated  information  from  the  Mexican 
Institute of Petroleum and PEMEX.

Consumption  of  lubricants,  bitumen  and  paraffin  waxes  are  available  from 
1990 and petroleum coke from 1993.  
Prior 
to  1987, 
the  split  of  LPG  consumption  between  residential  and 
commercial/public services has been estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
Natural gas 
General notes 
Natural  gas  reported  in  the  IEA  publications  may  be  different  from  what  is 
reported  in  the  Mexican  energy  publications,  as  IEA  includes  only  dry  gas  and 
excludes natural gas liquids, which are considered as part of oil. 
Transformation 
The split of natural gas used for hydrogen manufacture and used in refineries is 
not  currently  available  and  it  will  be  provided  in  the  2021  edition  of  this 
publication. 
Consumption 
Losses and pipeline transport have been included in oil and gas extraction. 
From 1993 to 1999, part of energy industry own use and non-specified industry 
data were estimated. 
Since  1993,  the  breakdown  of  the  energy  sector  and  of  other  sectors  is 
available. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
For  the  2020  July  edition,  new  data  supplied  by  the  Mexican  administration  for 
2018 and 2019 were incorporated in place of previous estimates. 
The Mexican administration believes the fuels categorised as industrial wastes 
(non-renewable) are likely residual gas, however more investigation is needed. 
Revisions, if applicable, are expected next cycle.

Supply 
Prior  to  2017  data,  some  bagasse  production  has  been  attributed  to  other 
vegetal  materials  and  residues.  This  causes  a  break  in  series  between  2016 
and 2017. Revisions prior to 2017 are expected in the future. 
Data for bagasse production are available from 2008. 
Consumption 
Increased  consumption  in  the  industry  and  transformation  sectors  for  solid 
biofuels in 2017 is attributed to bagasse. 
Data for solid biofuels used in autoproducer electricity plants from 1991 to 2005 
have been estimated by the Mexican administration. 
Data on biogases consumption are available from 1997. 
Electricity and heat 
General notes 
For the 2022 edition, due to data availability issues, some data provided by the 
Mexican administration for 2020 were equal to the values for previous years. 
For  2021p,  all  data  have  been  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on 
monthly/quarterly submissions and publically available data sources. 
For  the  2020  July  edition,  new  data  supplied  by  the  Mexican  administration  for 
2018 and 2019 were incorporated in place of previous estimates. 
The  Mexican  administration  is  currently  undertaking  revisions  of  the  electricity 
time  series  back  to  1996.  Revisions  include  changes  on  inputs  and  outputs  on 
power  plants  fuelled  mainly  by  combustible  fuels  and  the  reclassification  of 
main electricity plants previously reporting sub-bituminous coal as fuel to other 
bituminous coal for the period 2003-2015.  
Supply 
Electricity  generation  from  other  sources  mainly  represents  generation  from 
recovered  waste  heat  from  industry,  and  also  a  small  amount  of  electricity 
production from regenerative braking in suburban trains. 
The decrease in electricity produced from wind in 2017 is due to an earthquake 
which damaged infrastructure in the south of the country.

Production of main activity producer electricity plants from wind is available from 
1994. 
Electricity production from wind and solar photovoltaic is available from 1990. 
Discrepancies  occur  between  respective  reported  figures  for  electricity  trade 
between the US and Mexico from 2013 onwards. 
Transformation 
New autoproducer electricity plants fuelled with coke oven gases were put on-
line in 1999. 
Electricity  production  from  solid  biofuels  and  biogases  data  are  available 
respectively from 1991 and 1997. 
Consumption 
Some electricity consumption in energy industry is included in the industry sub-
sector  where  it  was  generated  (e.g.  the  chemical  industry,  as  well  as  in  non-
specified industry). 
Direct use of solar thermal heat is available from 1990.

Netherlands 
Source 
The Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics, The Hague. 
General notes 
The  Netherlands  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  has  conducted  reviews  and 
revisions of their energy balance three times; in 2005, 2011 and 2015. The 2005 
revisions  were  to  improve  basic  energy  statistics,  particularly  with  respect  to 
carbon and CO2 reporting, while the 2011 revisions were part of a harmonization 
program  with  international  energy  statistics. The  2015  revisions  were  the  result 
of  increased  data  collection,  availability  of  new  source  information,  and  further 
alignment  with  international  energy  definitions.  More  details  are  available  here: 
www.cbs.nl. 
Coal 
General notes 
International trade into and through the hub ports of Amsterdam and Rotterdam 
is  complicated  by  the  capacity  to  purchase  coal  directly  at  these  points.  The 
majority  of  coal  passing  through  these  ports  is  intended  for  consumption  in 
European  countries  other  than  the  Netherlands,  which  is  neither  the  country  of 
origin or destination, therefore these data have been removed where possible. In 
the 2019 edition, the Central Bureau of Statistics proceeded to major revisions of 
trade  and  stock  changes  for  anthracite,  coking  coal,  other  bituminous  coal  and 
lignite since 1990. Imports now should only relate to coal for inland consumption 
according  to  Eurostat’s  statistical  regulation,  thus  eliminating  transits  to  other 
countries and stock changes of trading companies. 
Following  revisions  made  in the  previous  edition  to  data for  1995  onwards,  this 
edition includes further revisions made by the Dutch administration for the period 
1990  to  1994.  These  revisions  are  the  result  of  increased  data  collection, 
availability  of  new  source  information,  and  further  alignment  with  international 
energy standards.

Supply 
From 2013 onwards, trade reported by the Central Bureau of Statistics includes 
coal in transit, to align more closely with gross trade data.  
In the 2013 edition, non-specified exports for 2011 were estimated by the Central 
Bureau of Statistics due to a lack of information from key market players. 
For data prior to 2011, stock changes for primary coal types were estimated by 
the Dutch administration based on trade and consumption data. 
For  1984  to  1986,  production  from  other  sources  of  other  bituminous  coal 
represents a stock of “smalls” washed for re-use. 
Transformation 
In  the  2022  edition,  revisions  back to  2015  were  made  in the reporting of  blast 
furnaces, coke ovens and iron and steel industry. 
At  the  end  of  2015 three  low-efficiency  plants  running  on  bituminous  coal  input 
closed  down.  In  the  course  of  2017  another  two  old  installations  ceased 
operating.  These  closures  were  part  of  the  so-called  Agreement  on  Energy  for 
Sustainable Growth in the Netherlands agreed upon by the Social and Economic 
Council  of 
the  Netherlands  (SER)  and  more 
than 
forty  representative 
organisations and stakeholders. 
Consumption 
For  the  year  2020,  consumption  of  coking  coal  in  the  industry  sector  was 
observed for the first time. Potential revisions and completion of the time series 
will be included in the next publication, Coal Information 2022 April Release. 
In  2019,  the  consumption  of  lignite  decreased  significantly  as  result  of  a 
company  partly  ceasing  activities.  That  company  totally  ceased  its  activities  in 
2020. 
Prior to 1989, non-energy use is included with industry consumption. 
Oil  
General notes 
In  2017,  large  amounts  of  fuel  oil  were  reclassified  as  other  products  due  to 
their chemical properties.

Data for gas/diesel road consumption become more difficult to collect in 2013, as 
the distinction in taxation between road diesel and gasoil was abolished. 
Following  revisions  made  in the  previous  edition  to  data for  1995  onwards,  this 
edition includes further revisions made by the Dutch administration for the period 
1990  to  1994.  These  revisions  are  the  result  of  increased  data  collection, 
availability  of  new  source  information,  and  further  alignment  with  international 
energy definitions 
Motor gasoline includes other light oils until 1990. 
Some breaks in time series occur in 1990 when the Dutch administration started 
to report the petrochemical industry according to IEA methodology. 
From 1990 onwards, naphtha includes aromatics, naphtha and other light oils. 
Supply 
Trends in the supply of other oil products in 2020 are confirmed by the Dutch 
administration to be the result of companies sometimes reporting highly-aromatic 
fuel oil into this category.  
In the 2021 edition, stock changes of bitumen for 2018 and 2019 are estimated 
by the IEA Secretariat. 
Data  for  deliveries  of  fuel  oil  to  international  marine  bunkers  were  revised 
downwards in the 2019 edition back to 2015. This was due to an improvement in 
the underlying data and figures available to CBS Statistics Netherlands.  
In 2017 the main plant producing lubricants closed as a result there is no more 
refinery gross output of this product.  
Consumption 
Consumption  of  fuel  oil for fishing  in  2020  is  zero  as fishing  boats  switched  to 
gas/diesel oil.  
In  the  2019  edition  several  revisions  were  introduced  to  flows  relating  to  the 
chemical  and  petrochemical  industry.  Energy  consumption  in  the  chemical 
industry  has  been  revised  upwards  back  to  2012,  following  an  internal  audit  of 
the  data  that  revealed  gaps  in  coverage.  Non-energy  consumption  in  the 
chemical industry has been revised downwards back to 1990 following a review 
of the data submitted by one of the main companies.

Refinery  gas  includes  chemical  gas  and  is  included  in  chemical  industry 
consumption. 
Natural gas 
General notes 
In  the  2018  edition,  the  Dutch  administration  revised  the  supply  side  data  for 
1990-2016  in  order  to  (i)  better  account  for  flows  from  underground  storages 
which  used  to  be  incorporated  in  the  indigenous  production  data,  and  also  (ii) 
handle inflows/outflows of natural gas stored in Germany as imports/exports.  
In  the  2019  edition,  the  Dutch  administration  re-vised  the  opening  and  closing 
stock  levels  based  on  a  dedicated  questionnaire  used.  Additionally,  industrial 
consumption  was  revised  since  2012  based  on  inputs  coming  from  the 
Emissions Trad-ing Scheme (ETS) data 
Between 1981 and 1982, and between 1983 and 1984 there are breaks in time 
series  due  to  the  introduction  of  more  comprehensive  surveys  on  end-use 
consumption.  
Supply 
A production cap of natural gas was set by the government in 2015, which has 
been extended and gradually tightened for 2016, 2017 and 2018. 
Dutch trade figures include transit volumes. 
In  the  past,  the  amounts  reported  under  indigenous  production  also  included 
quantities  coming  from  stock  changes.  The  reason  was  that  the  Dutch 
administration  could  not  distinguish  between  quantities  of  natural  gas  falling 
under  marketable  production  and  amounts  being  moved  from  offshore  fields  to 
onshore  fields  without  undergoing  any  purification  and/or  other  necessary 
production  processes.  From  2015,  the  data  reported  distinguish  between 
amounts to be reported as production and amounts that should be classified as 
stock changes. 
International marine bunkers were reported for the first time in the 2019 edition. 
Transformation 
Data  for  non-specified  (energy  own-use)  represent  natural  gas  combusted  by 
the distribution operator for the purpose of operating the gas distribution grid.

The  2009  increase  in  input  to  main  activity  electricity  producer  consumption  is 
due to the opening of a new plant in the second half of 2008. 
Consumption 
In the 2018 edition, the Dutch administration provided data for the non-specified 
(other)  non-energy  use  flow  for  the  years  2007-2014,  which  represent  the 
volume of gas injected as cushion gas in a new underground storage. 
Biofuels and waste 
Supply 
Increases  in  biodiesel  production for  2017  are  related  to  increased  capacity  of 
existing plants and increased demand. 
From  2009  to  2012,  and  again  from  2014  the  production  and  trade  of  pure 
biogasoline  were  confidential;  net  imports  were  estimated  by  the  Dutch 
administration based on consumption. 
Transformation 
The imports of wood pellets are up in 2018 due to the renewed subsidy for co-
firing of biomass at energy plants. 
In 2017, the increase in heat production from solid biofuels in main activity CHP 
plants is because there were two additional companies reporting data. 
Trade data for municipal waste are available from 2011. 
Consumption 
In the 2020 edition, there was a revision from 1990 to 2017 of the consumption 
of solid biofuels in the residential sector. 
From 2014, a better allocation of heat own-use was available for biogas digester 
prewarming, and in municipal waste burning plants for flue gas cleaning. 
The final consumption of solid biofuels in the residential and agriculture sector 
increased  in  2014  and  again  in  2016  due  to  the  results  of  new  surveys  and 
parameters.

Electricity and heat 
General notes 
In the 2016 and 2017 editions, data for the years 1990-2013 were revised by the 
Dutch  administration  following  an  extended  review  of  old  national  publications 
and new data obtained from grid operators.  
Supply 
In 2019, the Dutch administration revised transmission and distribution losses of 
heat  back  to  2015  to  incorporate  improved  data.  As  a  result,  there  a  break 
between 2014 and 2015. Historical revisions are pending. 
For  2018,  the  increase  in  electricity  output  from  Solar PV  autoproducer 
electricity plants is in part due to the inclusion of solar on industry surveys. As a 
result autoproduction in various industries was captured for the first time. 
For 2018, the declines in heat generation from municipal waste, and heat used 
for  electricity  generation,  and  also  the  increase  in  electricity  output  from 
municipal  waste,  are  due  to  a  change  in  ownership  of  a  company  which  sold 
heat.  
Data on heat production from chemical sources are available from 2017. 
The  decrease  in  electricity  production  from  nuclear  power  in  1997,  2013,  and 
2017  is  due  to maintenance  shutdowns  at  the  Netherlands’  only  nuclear  power 
plant. 
Electricity from other sources represents generation from expansion gases and 
chemical waste gases. 
The large increase in electricity trade in 1999 is due to the liberalisation of the 
Dutch  electricity  market.  Until  2003,  trade  data  are  based  on  contracted 
quantities instead of physical flows. 
The increase of heat produced in main heat plants in 1995 is due to a change in 
ownership of one large installation, resulting in its reclassification from being an 
autoproducer to a main activity plant.  
Electricity production from solar photovoltaic is available from 1990.

Transformation 
For  2019,  the  increases  in  electricity  output  from  other  sources,  and  heat 
output from chemical heat are in part due to improved data availability. 
Data  on  electricity  and  heat  output  from  industrial  waste  are  available  from 
2019. Historical revisions are pending. 
In mid-2017, two other bituminous coal-fired power stations closed, as a result 
output from other bituminous coal declined in 2018. Another plant closed in-late 
2019. 
The  efficiency  of  blast  furnace  gas-fired  autoproducer  CHP  plants  increases 
between 2015 and 2016 due to improved methods for allocating inputs between 
sold and unsold heat. 
Heat output from chemical heat, and other sources is available from 2015. 
Electricity output from other sources refers to production from expansion gases 
and recovered heat.  
Heat  used  for  electricity  production  represents  waste  heat  bought  from  other 
industries  that  was  generated  from  combustible  fuels.  The  corresponding 
electricity output is included with that of natural gas. 
Autoproducer  heat  plants  using  refinery  gases  are  included  with  autoproducer 
CHP plants because data are considered confidential for 1990. 
Heat  production  in  commercial  and  public  services  includes  production  in 
agriculture. 
All  municipal  waste  autoproducer  electricity  and  heat  only  plants  have  been 
reclassified  by  Statistics  Netherlands  as  autoproducer  CHP from  2012,  causing 
breaks in the time series. 
Prior  to  2008,  a  few  small  autoproducer  electricity  plants  using  solid  biofuels 
were included with main activity plants for reasons of confidentiality. 
In  2006,  some  municipal  waste  plants  changed  ownership  and  were 
reclassified from electricity only to CHP plants as they started heat projects. 
A  new  main  activity  producer  CHP  plant  fuelled  by  refinery  gas  started  up  in 
1999 and there was a fuel reclassification in 2000. 
For natural gas, all electricity production prior to 1998 is included in CHP plants.

For  biofuels  and  waste,  all  electricity  and  heat  produced  prior  to  1995  is 
included in CHP plants. 
Data for heat produced from biofuels and waste are available from 1990. 
Prior  to  1990,  all  electricity  and  heat  produced  from  coal  is  included  in  CHP 
plants. 
Inputs of hard coal for electricity production from 1981 to 1989 in terajoules (TJ) 
are  estimated  by  the  Secretariat  based  on  data  submitted  in  kilotonnes  (kt)  by 
the Dutch administration. 
Net  electricity  production  by  autoproducers  prior  to  1988  includes  production 
from combustible fuel sources only. 
Data for heat production by fuel in heat plants prior to 1987 are estimated by the 
Secretariat based on fuel inputs submitted by the Dutch administration. 
Data for heat production from main activity producer CHP plants and heat plants 
are available from 1982. 
Prior  to  1982,  electricity  production  from  and  inputs  to  main  activity  producer 
CHP plants are included with main activity producer electricity plants. 
For  1970  to  1973,  electricity  output  from  autoproducer  CHP  plants  has  been 
included with main activity producer CHP plants. 
Consumption 
In  2018,  the  decrease  in  heat  used  for  electricity  generation  was  due  to  the 
closure of a large installation. 
In  2018,  there  were  four  new  geothermal  installations  producing  heat  which 
warmed  greenhouses.  As  in  the  past,  these  would  be  categorised  in  the 
agriculture and forestry sector.  
For  data  from  2015  onwards,  there  is  improved  data  availability  for  heat.  This 
causes  breaks  in  series  for  transmission  and  distribution  losses,  and  heat 
consumption in the non-ferrous metals sectors. 
Increasing electricity consumption in agriculture andforestry is due to expansion 
of greenhouse farming.

Direct use of geothermal heat in agriculture/forestry starting in 2008 is due to a 
new  project  extracting  deep  geothermal  heat.  The  heat  produced  has  been 
used for heating greenhouses. 
Prior  to  1979,  electricity  consumption  in  agriculture  is  included  in  commercial 
and public services.

1994, data refer to calendar year. 
Coal 
General notes 
In the 2021 edition, the New Zealand administration provided revisions for some 
flows back to 2009. 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  New  Zealand  administration  has  done  historical 
revisions  on

In  the  2020  edition,  some  high  statistical  differences  can  be  found  for  many 
types of coal in various time periods. 
Peat, although produced in New Zealand, is not used as a fuel, and is used for 
agricultural purposes only. 
In the 2014 edition, the definition of hard coal was aligned with the International 
Recommendations for Energy Statistics. Prior to this, hard coal for New Zealand 
from  1960  to  1977  had  contained  sub-bituminous  coal.  The  portion  of  sub-
bituminous coal production and residential consumption has been estimated by 
the IEA Secretariat for this period and moved to brown coal. 
In the 2011 edition, the New Zealand administration has revised some of the coal, 
natural gas, oil, renewable and electricity time series back to 1990. 
Supply 
In  the  2021,  a  mine  was  reclassified  from  other  bituminous  coal  to  sub-
bituminous coal. The time series was revised accordingly.

In  2018  a  mine  of  other  bituminous  coal  that  was  not  in  production  in  2017 
restarted activity. 
In  2017  the  underground  mine  producing  coking  coal  switched  to  opencast 
operation. 
The  decrease  of  other  bituminous  coal  production  in  2015  is  due  to  a 
temporary  shutdown  in  one  of  the  coal  mines  at  the  beginning  of  2015  and 
another one at the end of 2015. 
A  detailed  breakdown  of  exports  of  coking  coal  by  country  of  destination 
between  2001  and  2011  is  estimated  by  the  IEA,  based  on  secondary  sources 
and partner data. 
Transformation 
Sub-bituminous coal inputs into coke ovens refers to coal that is merged with 
iron  sands  and  limestone  to  form  the  inputs  for  the  multi-hearth-furnaces,  kilns 
and  melters  that  produce  direct  reduced  iron  (Glenbrook  Steel  Site),  with  off-
gases and supplemental and natural gas driving CHP plants. This method, while 
not  the  typical  iron  and  steel  process,  produces  similar  by-products.  The  sub-
bituminous coal inputs are reported under coke oven coke transformation and 
the resulting  off-gases  are reported  as  production  of  coke  oven  gas  and  blast 
furnace gas. 
Blast  furnace  gas  production  and  distribution  losses  prior  to  1998  are  IEA 
Secretariat  estimates.  Portions  of  this  gas  will  have  been  used  for  energy 
purposes  in  the  multi-hearth  furnaces  or  elsewhere  in  the  plant.  Some 
transformation efficiencies will appear higher than normal due to non-reporting of 
certain inputs, including some confidential data.  
Consumption 
In  the  2020  edition,  some  quantities  of  sub-bituminous  coal  that  were 
previously  reported  under  other  bituminous  coal  were  moved  under  sub-
bituminous  coal.  This  reclassification  led  to  a  break  in  the  consumption  time 
series between 2018 and 2019 as the new classification starts in 2019. 
In 2018, some other bituminous coal quantities previously reported under non-
specified were reallocated into industry sectors. 
In  final  consumption,  some  industry  data  are  reported  in  non-specified  industry 
for confidentiality reasons.

In 2014, the increase in consumption of sub-bituminous coal in mines included 
the combustion of some unsold coal fines for safety reasons. 
Prior  to  2010,  the  construction  sector  is  included  with  commercial/public 
services. 
Prior to 2009, mining and quarrying is included in agriculture. 
Oil 
General notes 
In  the  2021  edition,  breaks  appear  between  2018  and  2019  for  other  oil 
products as a result of improved reporting infrastructure by the New Zealander 
administration. 
For 2016, the following data were estimated by the IEA Secretariat: consumption 
of  lubricants;  imports  of  bitumen;  and  refinery  output,  and  interproduct 
transfers of other oil products. 
For  2015,  the  following  data  were  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat:  stock 
changes  and  consumption  of  lubricants;  consumption  of  bitumen,  and  all 
figures for petroleum coke and other oil products. 
From 1998, gas/diesel oil includes light fuel oil. Until 1997, light fuel oil is under 
fuel oil. 
Until 1997, other hydrocarbons from natural gas sources correspond to synthetic 
gasoline production (ceased in February 1997).  
For 
reasons  of  confidentiality,  beginning 
in  1994, 
the  New Zealand 
administration no longer reports data on the production of methanol. 
Supply 
In  the  2022  edition,  receipts  from  renewables  of  biodiesel  for  blending  with 
transport  fuels  are  not  available  for  2019  and  2020  according  to  the  New 
Zealander administration. This can result in unexpected supply values. Revisions 
are expected next cycle. 
In the 2021 edition, the New Zealander administration revised stock changes for 
several primary and secondary oil products for as early as 2014 onwards.  
In 2019, New Zealand no longer produces lubricants.

Between 2013 and 2014, the jump in imports of kerosene-type jet fuel can be 
explained by an anticipated strike at the refineries.  
Transformation 
In 2020, gas/diesel oil inputs for electricity production are confirmed by the New 
Zealander  administration  to  be  higher  than  usual  due  to  generator  testing. 
Furthermore, input of gas/diesel oil for CHP production in 2020 is zero. 
Consumption 
The  increase  in  the  consumption  of  motor  gasoline  and  gas/diesel  oil  in  the 
residential  sector  in  2021p  is  due  to  a  methodological  change  by  the  New 
Zealander  administration.  These  quantities  now  include  these  oil  products 
purchased at service stations but used for recreational marine purposes. 
Between  2009  and  2010,  a  break  in  time  series  appears  for  demand  of 
gas/diesel as the administration changed its methodology for commercial/public 
services  
For 1960 to 1973, consumption data have been estimated by the Secretariat. 
Natural gas  
General notes 
2018  data  were  estimated  based  on  monthly  data  submitted  to  the  IEA 
Secretariat. 
Supply 
There are neither imports nor exports of natural gas for New Zealand. 
Transformation 
The large 1998 increase in input to autoproducer CHP plants is due to two new 
autoproducer CHP plants.  
In February 1997, production of synthetic gasoline from natural gas ended. 
Consumption 
Between 2012 and 2013 there are breaks in time series for the final consumption 
breakdown due to the introduction of a new survey.

In  2005,  the  decline  in  chemical  and  petrochemical  industry  consumption  was 
due  to  the  closure  of  the  Motunui  methanol  production  plant,  which  was  then 
reopened in late 2008.  
Prior to 2003, gas consumed in industry includes some gas for energy industry 
own-use. Since 1990, detailed consumption breakdown for industry is available. 
From  1977  to  1979  and  from  1986  to  1989,  losses  are  included  in  statistical 
differences. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
In  the  2022  edition,  biodiesel  data  are  not  available  between  2007  and  2008 
and  2016  and  2020.  The  administration  is  working  on  improving  liquid  biofuels 
statistics and revisions will be made in future editions. 
In  the  2020  edition,  extensive  revisions  were  made  for  the  time  series  back  to 
1990.  The  majority  of  the  revisions  were  related  to  transiting  the  New  Zealand 
data system from excel based to R based.  
For  the  2019  edition,  the  New  Zealand  administration  submitted  extensive 
revisions  back  to  1990  following  an  internal  review  of  their  systems  and 
methodologies.  
Due to improved wood data collection starting with 2016 data, increases in solid 
biofuels in transformation, supply and consumption may not be a true increase 
but more representative of increased data survey respondents. This results in a 
break in time series between 2015 and 2016.  
Transformation 
In  the  2022  edition,  data  on  fuel  input  and  electricity  generation  from  solid 
biofuels CHP auto-producers were revised thanks to a multi-year programme of 
work that the administration undertook to improve solid biofuels statistics. 
In  the  2019  edition,  data  on  electricity  production  from  biogases  were 
significantly  revised  by  the  New  Zealand  administration  following  an  internal 
review of systems and methodologies.

Consumption 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  repetition  of  data  is  an  estimate  by  the  New  Zealand 
administration  for  the  consumption  of  biogases  in  the  food,  beverages  and 
tobacco  sector  for  the  years  1990  to  2018  due  to  unavailability  of  data.  The 
same  is  true  for  the  consumption  of  biogases  in  the  commercial  and  public 
services sector from 2007 to 2018.  
Electricity and heat 
General notes 
For  the  2020  and  2019  editions,  the  New  Zealand  administration  submitted 
extensive  revisions  back  to  1990  following  an  internal  review  of  their  systems 
and  methodologies.  For  solar  PV, 
Information,  changed  their  entire  time  series.  Data  may  be  further  revised  in 
the  source  data,  Electricity  Market 
future editions.   
There  are  several  breaks  in  the  time  series  between  1987  and  1988  due  to  a 
reorganisation of government departments during 1987. 
Supply 
Heat outputs from main activity and autoproducer CHP plants are not available. 
Electricity  and  heat  production  from  other  sources  represents  waste  heat 
recovered and used for electricity production. This includes heat from recovered 
from chemical processes at acid plants in the fertiliser industry, where sulphur is 
the main input. 
Transformation 
For 2018, a shortage of natural gas resulted in decreased use of natural gas for 
electricity generation, and increased use of sub-bituminous coal.  
In  late  2015,  two  natural  gas-fired  power  stations  used  for  baseload  demand 
closed.  As  the  remaining  natural  gas-fired  plants  are  used  more  for  peak 
demand, there is a reduction in generation efficiency between 2015 and 2016. 
In  1999,  a  reclassification  of  autoproducer  plants  causes  some  breaks  in  the 
time series. 
Data  for  geothermal  electricity  production  by  autoproducers  are  available  from 
1990.

The  New  Zealand  administration  has  updated  efficiencies  for  electricity 
production  from  geothermal  heat  from  10%  to  15%  from  1990  onwards;  this 
causes a break in the time series between 1989 and 1990. 
In  the  2018  edition,  revisions  in  electricity  production  in  hydro  plants  back  to 
2002  are  related  to  a  change  in  methodology.  This  results  in  a  break  in  time 
series between 2001 and 2002. 
Electricity production by autoproducers from natural gas and from oil has been 
estimated by the Secretariat from 1970 to 1973. 
Consumption 
A  new  survey  starting  with  the  2013  data  can  cause  breaks  in  data  for  final 
consumption of electricity. 
The  consumption  of  electricity  by  the  transport  sector  is  collected  under  the 
Australian  and  New Zealand  Standard  Industrial  Classification  (ANZSIC)  2006 
system’s  “Transport,  Postal  and  Warehousing”  category.  As  this  covers 
commercial services as well as transport, MBIE estimates the amount of this that 
can  be  allocated  to  transport.  At  present  this  data  does  not  allow  for  the 
disaggregation by transport sub-sector.  
Beginning  in  2013,  the  falling  electricity  consumption  in  the  pulp,  paper  and 
printing sector follows with the permanent closure of a paper machine in one of 
New Zealand’s larger energy users, following decreased demand for newsprint.   
Data on direct use of geothermal heat are available from 1990 and direct use of 
solar thermal heat from 2002. 
From  1974  to  1993  transmission  and  distribution  losses  include  statistical 
differences.  
The classifications used by the administration of New Zealand were changed in 
1991. 
Electricity  consumption  in  pulp,  paper  and  printing  is  included  in  wood  and 
wood products prior to 1990.

General Notes 
In  the  2018  edition,  data  for  Norway  were  revised  back  to  2010,  following  the 
introduction of a new system for energy balances and energy accounts. Breaks 
in  series  may  appear  between  2009  and  2010  as  a  result.  For  more  detailed 
information  regarding 
the  methodological  changes,  please  refer 
to 
the 
documentation of statistics production since statistics year 2010 on the Statistics 
Norway website. At the time of writing, the document was available in Norwegian 
as “Dokumentasjon av statistikkproduksjonen fra statistikkår 2010 og fremover”. 
Coal  
General notes 
Other bituminous coal includes lignite. 
Production of coking coal, coke oven coke and coke oven gas ceased in the 
late 1980s. 
Supply 
A downward trend of other bituminous coal production started in 2017. 
The  decrease  of  other  bituminous  coal  production  in  2015  is  due  to  a 
temporary shutdown in one of the coal mines. 
The  decrease  of  other  bituminous  coal  production  in  2005  is  due  to  a  fire  in 
one of the coal mines; this entailed a break in the production for a large part of 
the year.

In  the  2022  edition,  as  part  of  the  continuing  efforts  for  data  improvement,  the 
Norwegian  administration 
introduced 
revisions  back 
to  2010  due 
to 
methodological  changes  and  new  sources.  There  may  be  breaks  for  some

products and flows between 2009 and 2010. Additional revisions are expected in 
the next edition. 
In  the  2021  edition,  in  continuation  of  the  efforts  related  to  the  new  system  for 
energy  balances  and  energy  accounts  introduced  in  the  previous  edition,  the 
Norwegian  administration  further  revised  back  to  2010.  Additional  revisions  are 
expected in the next edition.  
In the 2018 edition, the Norwegian administration made widespread revisions to 
their  data  back  to  2010,  following  the  introduction  of  a  new  system  for  energy 
balances and energy accounts. Breaks in series may appear between 2009 and 
2010 as a result. 
A  major  project  is  being  carried  by  Statistics  Norway  in  order  to  reduce  the 
statistical  differences  observed  between  calculated  supply  and  demand  of  oil. 
Starting with 2014 data, new methodologies have been introduced for reporting 
crude oil, NGL and naphtha (see details below). Balances for motor gasoline, 
gas/diesel oil, kerosene-type jet fuel and fuel oil are also under investigation. 
Further improvements are expected in future editions. 
The  IEA  Secretariat  estimates  the  net  calorific  value  for  Norwegian  crude  oil 
based on the oil product outputs of the oil refineries. 
Prior to 1990, ethane is included with LPG.  
Supply 
Due to refinery maintenance, refinery output of several oil products decreased in 
2019. 
In the  2021  edition,  indigenous  production  of  additives/oxygenates  decreased 
due to a change in reporting methodology by the Norwegian administration.  
In 2017 the Goliat field was offline from September through October for planned 
and unplanned maintenance.  
Crude oil production includes condensates. 
Starting  with  2014  data,  Statistics  Norway  has  changed  the  source  for  annual 
crude  oil  exports  to  include  shipping  information  collected  by  the  National 
Petroleum Directorate. 
Starting from 2014 data, there is a break in naphtha supply time series due to a 
change in reporting methodology adopted by Statistics Norway.

Prior to 2002 data, a part of LPG exports was reported as NGL exports. 
Since  1986,  imports  of  refinery  feedstocks  are reported  under the relevant  oil 
product imports. 
Transformation 
In 2016 the Slagen refinery underwent maintenance which led to a decrease in 
refinery throughput for that year. 
In  2014,  the  strong  decrease  in  crude  oil  refinery  intake  is  linked  to  heavy 
maintenance work carried in the refineries in fall 2014. 
Starting  with  1990  data,  gas/diesel  oil  used  for  autoproduced  electricity  on  oil 
and gas platforms are reported under energy industry own use. 
From 1970 to 1975, gas/diesel oil for electricity generation has been estimated 
by the Secretariat. 
Consumption 
In the  2022  edition, the Norwegian  administration  revised  consumption  data for 
several  sub-sectors,  most  notably  for  gas/diesel  oil,  motor  gasoline  and 
kerosene type jet fuel, from 2020 onwards. 
Use  of  oil  products  for  heating  in  households  is  no  longer  allowed;  hence,  the 
consumption of oil products in the residential sector declined in 2019. 
Data on naphtha consumption in Norway are currently unavailable. 
Consumption of lubricants is reported within industry, as no further breakdown is 
available. 
In 2005 data, breaks in petroleum coke consumption time series appear due to 
reallocation in the industry sector. Refinery fuel is reported from 2001 data. 
In  2003  and  1993  data,  breaks  in  time  series  appear  for  consumption  in  the 
chemical/petrochemical industry due to newly available information. 
Prior to 2000, gas/diesel oil used in fishing is included in agriculture/forestry.

Natural gas 
General notes 
For Norway, the supply of natural gas is the residual of two very large and opposite 
amounts:  indigenous  production  and  exports.  As  a  result,  large  statistical 
differences  in  some  years  may  lead  to  discrepancies  in  the  growth  rates  of 
supply and demand of natural gas. 
Supply 
Since 2008 data on opening and closing stock levels are available. 
Transformation 
Since 2007, natural gas inputs to all electricity and CHP plants are included in 
autoproducer electricity plants for confidentiality reasons. 
The last main activity electricity producer closed down in 2016. 
Consumption 
Prior to 2008, natural gas amounts used in gas extraction by offshore platforms 
were not included in production data. 
Since 2002 domestic navigation is included under non-specified transport. 
The  2007  increase  in  non-specified  transport  is  due  to  the  wider  use  of  gas-
powered sea vessels. 
Before  2000,  energy  use  in  oil  and  gas  extraction  also  included  some  final 
consumption amounts. 
In 1992 the increase in oil and gas extraction is due to the start-up of new fields. 
Consumption for pipeline transport is included in energy industry own use.  
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
The  Norwegian  administration  expects  to  revise  2017  data  for  biogases  in  the 
next reporting cycle.

Some  of  the  data  reported  under  solid  biofuels  excluding  charcoal  includes 
charcoal.  Efforts  are  being  made  by  the  Norwegian  administration  to  separate 
this data in the future. 
Prior to  2007,  equal  shares  of renewable  and  non-renewable  municipal waste 
were estimated because the actual split was not known. 
Data for industrial waste and biogases are available from 1991. 
Supply 
The  data  for  the  indigenous  production  of  biogases  is  based  on  consumption 
data. 
In 2014, the biodiesel production facility closed. 
Data for liquid biofuels imports are available starting in 2006. 
Transformation 
Increased  heat  production from  biogases  and other  liquid  biofuels  in  2018  is 
related to replacing fossil fuels.  
Consumption 
In the 2022 edition, charcoal consumption data appears in residential for 2021p 
for the first time. Historical data will be revised in the next edition. 
From 2019, data for solid biofuels in the industry sector replaces coal/coke as a 
reductant. This is seen in the chemical/petrochemical and iron and steel sectors. 
Decreases in the consumption of solid biofuels in the chemical/petrochemical, 
non-metallic  minerals  and  food,  beverages  and  tobacco  in  2018  are  related  to 
the fact that charcoal was included before but now it has been deducted. 
Distribution losses for biogases are included in commercial/public services prior 
to 2003. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply 
Solar  electricity  production  in  the  residential  sector  is  available  from  2018. 
However,  it  only  refers  to  electricity  sold  –  it  does  not  include  electricity 
generated and consumed by households themselves.

The  electricity  generated  from  other  sources  represents  electricity  from  waste 
heat. 
Prior to 2009, transmission and distribution losses include statistical differences.  
Heat  produced  by  autoproducer  heat  plants from  chemical  processes  and from 
other sources and used for electricity production has been estimated by the IEA 
Secretariat for the period 1990 to 2006. 
Electricity production from wind is available from 1993. 
Data  for  heat  production  from  heat  pumps  and  electric  boilers  (including  the 
electricity used for this production) are available from 1989. 
Data for heat production are not available prior to 1983. 
Transformation 
In  September  2020,  a  fire  occured  at  a  natural  gas-fired  power  plant.  As  a 
result, lower electricity output from natural gas was observed in 2021 and early 
2022. 
Prior  to  2018,  heat  output  from  heat  pumps  included  district  cooling.  Electricity 
inputs to heat pumps run in cooling mode is included for all years. Revisions are 
pending. 
Increased  heat  production from  biogases  and other  liquid  biofuels  in  2018  is 
related to replacing fossil fuels.  
For  2017,  the  apparent  increase  in  heat  output  from  solid biofuel-fired  Main 
CHP plants is due to a plant reclassification. 
In the 2016 edition, Norway corrected the industrial waste consumption in heat 
plants,  and  reclassified  some  the  corresponding  heat  output  under  other 
sources. 
Starting in 2007, data for natural gas electricity and CHP plants are aggregated 
in  autoproducer  electricity  plants  for  confidentiality  reasons.  The  revisions 
received  for  the  2018  edition  partially  altered  these  data  for  the  period  2010  to 
2016, but no explanations were given. 
Breaks in the time series between 1996 and 1997 and between 2001 and 2002 
and now 2009 and 2010 are due to a reclassification of main activity producers 
and  autoproducers.  This  includes  the  apparent  cessation  of  autoproducer

pumped  hydro  and  hydro  electricity  generation  since  2010,  where  this 
generation has been reclassified as main activity. 
Data for heat production from biogases are available from 1995. 
Prior to 1991, net electricity production by autoproducers by industry sub-sector 
was  estimated  by  the  Secretariat  based  on  data  submitted  by  the  Norwegian 
administration. 
Data on inputs and outputs in heat plants are not available prior to 1983 for main 
activity heat plants and prior to 1988 for autoproducer heat plants. 
Consumption 
Electricity  consumption  in  road  refers  to  calculated  consumption  for  100% 
electricity  vehicles  only  i.e.  it  excludes  hybrids.  This  consumption  is  removed 
from  residential  and  commercial  and  public  services  consumption  where 
relevant.  The  Norwegian  Administration  hopes  to  include  hybrid  vehicles  in  a 
coming cycle.  
For the 2019 edition, heat consumption in the chemical (incl. petrochemical) and 
commercial  and  public  services  sectors  was  revised  back  to  2007.  Historical 
revisions  for  other  sectors  are  pending.  As  a  result,  breaks  in  series  occur  for 
heat consumption in some sectors between 2016 and 2017.  
Consumption  of  electricity  for  pipeline  transport  is  included  in  oil  and  gas 
extraction.  
The  breakdown  of  heat  consumption  by  industry  sub-sector  was  expanded  in 
1992, reclassified in 1994 and collected by a new reporting system in 1997.

Coal 
General notes 
Other  recovered  gases  which  appear  in  the  balances  as  output  from  blast 
furnaces  also  include  off-gases  from  zinc  and  copper  smelting,  ceramics  kilns 
and  steel  production,  thus  artificially  increasing  the  overall  efficiency  of  blast 
furnaces when calculated. 
The decrease in exports and consumption of coking coal, as well as the stock 
built in 2019 are consequence of a reduction of the external and internal demand 
of iron and steel, which was impacted, among other factors, by the carbon and 
electricity prices.  
Patent fuel trade data may include transit trade. 
Prior to 2016 data, other bituminous coal includes anthracite. 
Transformation 
In  2019  the  use  of  other  bituminous  coal  for  electricity  generation  decreased 
as  consequence  of  high  CO2  prices  and  high  mining  costs,  which  made  more 
competitive other generation technologies such as natural gas or renewables, as 
well as electricity imports. 
The  decrease  in  the  consumption  of  lignite  in  Main  Activity  Producer  CHP 
Plants in 2019 is a result of the shutdown of a large power unit for renovation. 
For the year 2015, there is production of gas works gas but no reporting of any 
input  to  that  process.  The  LPG  input  was  too  small  to  be  appeared  (less  than 
0,5);  until  2016,  the  reported  numbers  were  rounded  to  the  nearest  whole 
number in the Joint Annual Questionnaires. 
For  the  2018  and  2019  editions,  the  Central  Statistical  Office  has  revised  their 
methodology  which  accounts  for  sold  heat  produced  from  autoproducer  heat 
plants  using  coking  coal  and  other  bituminous  coal,  resulting  in  lower,  but 
more accurate data for 2007 onwards.

Consumption 
In the 2022 edition, revisions were made in for 2017-2019 coke oven coke. This 
product  is  used  as  a  reducing  agent  for  the  production  of  zinc  concentrates.  In 
previous years, it was treated as energy use. The values are currently shown as 
non-energy use 
Introduction of anti-smog resolution led to reduction of hard coal consumption in 
households in 2019. 
Inputs  of  coke  oven  coke  into  blast  furnaces  and  consumption  in  the  iron  and 
steel sector were estimated in 2019 so as to keep the efficiency of blast furnaces 
at 40%. Part of the large decrease in the iron and steel sector consumption can 
be explained by that estimation. 
Consumption in agriculture/forestry for BKB, and own use in power stations for 
lignite  are  residual  flows,  so  may  contain  statistical  differences  and  other 
consumption not reported elsewhere. As a consequence, changes in these time 
series may not be wholly representative of the activities shown. 
Prior  to  2010,  own  use  in  coal  mines  included  workers’  take  home  allowance, 
which should be included in residential consumption. 
Oil 
General notes 
From 1997, production from other sources (natural gas) of other hydrocarbons 
corresponds  to  hydrogen  used  in  refineries,  also  represented  as  the  output  of 
non-specified transformation in the balances format.  
Supply 
Output of petroleum coke is produced from a new refinery plant installed at the 
end of 2019.  
Between  2016  and  2017,  a  break  in  series  for  stocks  of  refinery  feedstocks 
results from a change in reporting methodology. 
In  2018  new  legislation  introduced  a  biofuel  blending  obligation  for  liquid  fuels. 
The effects of this policy can be seen throughout 2017, as companies prepared 
for the implementation of the new directive, and in 2018 once the directive came 
into force.

Transformation 
In  2017  lower  refinery  activity  is  linked  to  maintenance  activities  at  several 
refinery installations across the country.  
Prior to 1998, inputs of gas/diesel oil and heavy fuel oil to autoproducer CHP in 
petroleum refineries have been included in the transformation. 
Consumption 
In 2016 regulatory changes affecting the customs and tax authorities meant that 
consumption of fuel in the informal economy decreased.  
In 2015, a new flue-gas desulphurisation unit was installed. As this unit facilitates 
high sulphur fuel oil burning in place of natural gas, this explains the increase in 
fuel oil consumption in oil refineries. 
Natural gas 
Supply 
Sharp  decline  in  Exports  with  2021  preliminary  data  is  due  to  a  change  in 
methodology. 
Exports  include  all  the  natural  gas  sold  by  companies  operating  in  Poland 
(these are mainly re-exports). 
Natural  gas  reported 
hydrocarbons. This results in a high gross calorific value for production.  
in  associated  production  contains  some  heavier 
Transformation 
Non-specified  transformation  data  represent  natural  gas  used  for  hydrogen 
manufacture. This hydrogen is used for hydrodesulphurization in oil refineries.  
In  2013  and  2014  some  CHP  plants  were  used  as  backup  reserve  plants, 
resulting  in  a  decrease  in  consumption  under  main  activity  producers  CHP 
plants. 
In  2004  and  2005  small  amounts  of  natural  gas  were  used  to  start  up  main 
activity electricity plants. 
In  the  2017  data,  local  small-CHP  &  heat  plants  were  reclassified  from  the 
commercial/public services to the transformation sector and the residential sub-
sector.

Consumption 
Distribution losses may include some statistical differences.  
Non-specified  energy  includes  gas  used  for  heating  and  pumping  operations  in 
the distribution network. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
Several  breaks  in the industrial waste time  series  are  caused  by  difficulties  in 
the classification of wastes. 
In the 2018 edition, solid biofuels were corrected for 2015 data. 
There  is  a  break  in  time  series  between  2015  and  2016  for  biogases  due  to 
reclassification from autoproducer to main activity plants. 
The  increases  in  municipal  wastes  starting  in  2016  are  related  to  two  new 
plants. 
Data  on  biodiesels  are available  from  2005;  biogasoline  data from  2003;  and 
other liquid biofuels data from 2009. 
In  2008,  a  new  questionnaire  was  launched  which  increased  the  coverage  of 
renewable and waste data. 
Supply 
Under current Polish law, only producers and importers of biodiesel are obliged 
to  fulfil  the  National  Indicative  Target  of  share  of  biofuels  in  the  total  usage  of 
transportation  fuels.  Since  the  regulation  is  currently  not  applied  to  retail 
distributors  they,  for  economic  reason,  rather  export  the  biodiesel  than  sell  it 
domestically. This results in low domestic consumption and increase of exports 
in 2016. 
Production of other liquid biofuels increased in 2015 because new companies 
started to report their biofuels production to the Polish administration. 
Transformation 
In  2017,  heat  production  from  autoproducer  CHP  and  heat  plants  burning 
municipal wastes increased due to two new plants.

Before  2000,  industrial  waste  was  used  interchangeably  with  light  fuel  oil  in 
some plants, which might result in breaks in the time series.  
Consumption 
The  decrease  in  the  consumption  of  biodiesel  in  the  road  sector  in  2017  is 
related  to  an  unfavourable  pricing  scheme  on  the  domestic  market,  causing 
consumers to choose diesel and producers to export or blend the biodiesel they 
produced. 
The  consumption  of  solid  biofuels in  non-metallic  minerals  decreased  in  2017 
because  modern  clinker  ovens  have  been  replacing  solid  biofuels  with 
municipal wastes. 
Increases in consumption of biodiesel in 2016 are related to a policy change in 
the middle of the year. 
Data for biogases refer only to the gas from fermentation of biomass. 
Until  1998,  data  for  industrial  waste  include  other  recovered  gases  which 
have  to  be  reported  in  Coal  questionnaire,  causing  a  break  between  1997  and 
1998. 
Between  1992  and  1993,  due  to  data  availability,  there  is  a  large  increase  in 
solid biofuels for residential, commercial/public services and agriculture/forestry. 
Electricity and heat 
General notes 
Prior  to  2010,  heat  supply  and  consumption  can  include  autoproducers  unsold 
heat. Previous attempts to address such issue may have caused breaks for heat 
production and fuel in autoproducer heat plants (1993) and in autoproducer CHP 
plants, and for heat consumption in industry sub-sectors. 
Supply 
Electricity  and  heat  from  chemical  heat  and  other  sources  are  available  from 
2011. Prior to that, these amounts could be included under different categories. 
Heat distribution losses are available from 2004. Prior to that they are included in 
consumption. 
Heat production from heat pumps is available from 2009.

World energy balances 2022 Edition 
 
Transformation 
For 2019, the increase in electricity output from industrial waste was in part due 
to the opening of a new waste-to-energy plant in late 2018. 
In  2019,  electricity  output 
from  solid  biofuels 
increased 
following 
the 
introduction of a new state support scheme. In 2016, output declined following a 
reduction in state support for biomass co-firing.  
For the 2017 edition, the Polish administration revised electricity production data 
from  power  plants  run  by  combustible  fuels,  reclassifying  those  that  were 
previously  reported  as  main  activity  CHP  as  main  activity  electricity  plants. 
These  revisions  mainly  affected  coal-fired  power  plants  and  created  breaks  in 
time series from 2004 onwards. 
In  the  2017  edition,  the  Polish  administration  reclassified  some  amounts  of 
electricity consumption from chemical and petrochemical sector to oil refineries, 
following access to improved survey methods.  
Due to a reclassification of plant types, there is a break in time series in 2015 for 
the generation of heat in autoproducer CHP plants in the iron and steel sector.  
In 2014 and 2008, a number of CHP plants were reclassified from autoproducer 
to main activity producer due to an industry re-organisation. 
Prior  to  2013,  electricity  used  for  pumped  storage  (mixed  plants)  is  included 
under used for pumped storage (pure hydro pumping plants).  
Data for direct use of geothermal heat are available from 2000 and direct use of 
solar  thermal  heat  in  commercial/public  services  from  2002  and  in  residential 
from 2009. 
Heat  consumption  in  energy  industry  own  use  includes  process  heat  not  sold 
before 1995. 
Data  for  electricity  production  in  autoproducer  electricity  plants  are  available 
from 1986. 
Consumption 
Electricity  consumption  in  Road  refers  to  consumption  in  designated  public 
charging  spots.  Charging  of  vehicles  in  a  residential  setting  is  included  in 
Residential consumption.

Coal 
General notes 
Hard coal data prior to 1978 may include sub-bituminous coal. 
Consumption 
Between 1997 and 2001 gas works gas was gradually replaced by natural gas 
in the commercial/public service and residential sectors. 
The  production  of  pig  iron  ceased  in  the  first  quarter  of  2001,  leading  to 
decreases  in  supply  and  consumption  of  coking  coal,  coke  oven  coke,  coke 
oven gas and blast furnace gas in 2001. 
Oil 
General notes 
The  increase  in  refinery  throughput  in  2015  is  a  result  of  increased  refinery 
capacity linked to the expansion of the Sines refinery. 
A new hydrocracking unit started operations in Sines Refinery in April 2013. This 
explains  the  2013  increase  in  refinery  feedstock  imports,  as  well  as  middle 
distillate production. 
Supply 
Production 
(natural  gas)  of  other  hydrocarbons 
corresponds  to  hydrogen  used  in  refineries,  also  represented  as  the  output  of

non-specified transformation in the balances format. 
Scheduled  refinery  maintenance  lasting  two  months  in  2018  affected  the 
production and exports of secondary oil products.

Consumption 
Due to an investment to increase capacity, petrochemical plant operations were 
stopped for almost five months, thereby decreasing the consumption of naphtha 
and LPG for non-energy use in 2018. 
Consumption  of  gas/diesel  oil  in  industry  and  commercial/public  services 
represents diesel use in mobile fleets. 
Natural gas 
Supply 
In February 1997, Portugal started to import natural gas. 
The  surge  in  2017  imports  is  attributed  to  the  consumption  of  gas-fired  power 
plants that filled in the gap of decreased hydro-generation due to a drought. 
Transformation 
Since  2012,  data  reported  for  non-specified  transformation  represent  natural 
gas  used  for  hydrogen  manufacture.  Prior  to  this  year,  these  quantities  are 
reported under oil refineries. 
The 2002 decrease in natural gas used for gas works (transformation) is due to 
the closing of the Lisbon gas works plant in May 2001.  
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
Charcoal  data  for  2018  (indigenous  production  and  residential  sector)  are 
delayed. Revisions are expected in the future. 
Data  for  solid  biofuels  were  revised  in  a  previous  publication  by  the  National 
administration  from  1990  to  2001,  which  may  result  in  breaks  in  time  series 
between 1989 and 1990. 
Data are available from 1994 for biogases, from 1999 for municipal waste and 
from 2003 for industrial waste.

Consumption 
The use of biogasoline for blending decreased in 2017 because it is no longer 
compulsory to use biofuels in gasoline.  
Data for solid biofuels were further revised based on a new survey on industry, 
resulting in breaks in sub-sectoral consumption for 2012. 
Between  2009  and  2010  a  new  survey  on  energy  consumption  in  households 
creates  a  break  in  time  series  in  the  solid  biofuels  consumption  in  residential 
time series.  
Electricity and heat 
Supply 
Data for production of electricity from solar photovoltaic and wind are available 
from 1989.  
The large decrease in electricity output from hydro for 2017 is due to decreased 
rainfall. 
Transformation 
In 2019 and 2020, one of the two other bituminous coal-fired plants in Portugal 
operated with reduced output. The plant permanently closed in late 2020.  
In the 2017 edition, the data for production of electricity by autoproducer hydro 
plants  were  revised  between  1990  and  1999,  according  to  a  new  national 
methodology.  
For 2016 data onwards, heat and electricity production from chemical sources 
have been reclassified as autoproducer CHP production from industrial waste, 
causing cessation of the heat and electricity generated from heat from chemical 
processes  time  series,  and  causing  breaks  in  the  industrial  waste  time  series 
between 2015 and 2016. 
In 2007, some power plants that were previously reported as main activity CHP 
have been reclassified as autoproducer CHP. 
In 2007, the power station that burns industrial waste started to work as a CHP 
plant, whereas previously it was only producing electricity. 
New plants fuelled by solid biofuels and by municipal waste started in 1999.

Prior to 1992, data for electricity production by autoproducers include production 
from combustible fuel sources only. 
Electricity production from other oil products refers to methanol. 
Data for production  of  electricity  in  main  activity  producer  CHP  plants  and  the 
associated fuel inputs are not available prior to 1980. 
Consumption 
In the 2017 edition, the Portuguese administration reclassified some amounts of 
heat  consumption  from  the  residential  to  the  commercial  and  public  services 
sector for the period 1998 to 2014 following a new national methodology. 
Data for direct use of solar thermal heat is available from 1989 and direct use 
of geothermal heat from 1994.

Slovak Republic 
Source 
Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, Bratislava. 
General notes 
Data are available starting in 1971.  
The  Slovak  Republic  became  a  separate  state  in  1993  and  harmonised  its 
statistics to EU standards in 2000. These two facts lead to several breaks in time 
series between 1992 and 1993, and between 2000 and 2001. 
Coal 
General notes 
BKB includes peat products. 
In 2019 there is a general decrease in coal supply affecting all products, which is 
driven  by  less  coal-fired  power  generation  and  reduced  operation  in  the  iron  & 
steel sector. 
Data  for  anthracite,  patent  fuel  and  coal  tar  all  begin  in  2005.  Prior  to  this, 
anthracite  was  included  with  other  hard  coals,  and  patent  fuel  and  coal  tar 
data were not reported. 
Since 2005, data for coal tar and patent fuel are based solely on trade receipts. 
Production  of  coal  tar  which  is  consumed  within  the  national  boundary  is  not 
reported.  Consumption  of  patent  fuel  adopts  the  residual  methodology  for 
statistical differences described above.  
Breaks  in  time  series  may  exist  between  2000  and  2001  as  the  result  of  the 
implementation of a new survey system. 
Commercial/public  services  also  includes  statistical  differences  for  other 
bituminous coal, lignite, patent fuel and coke oven coke from 1980 onwards 
and BKB from 1989 onwards. 
Supply 
Coal mining is scheduled to end in the Slovak Republic by 2023.

Oil 
General notes 
Starting with 2016 data ethane is included with refinery gas. 
From  2001  onwards,  kerosene  type  jet  fuel  includes  small  amounts  of  other 
kerosene. 
Transformation 
In  2018,  one  of  the  companies  changed  its  status  from  main  activity  producer 
CHP  plant  to  autoproducer  CHP  plant,  resulting  in  a  decrease  in  refinery  gas 
and fuel oil consumption for main activity producer CHP. 
Between  2008  and  2009,  one  of  the  companies  changed  its  status  from 
autoproducer  CHP  plant  to  main  activity  producer  CHP  plant,  resulting  in  a 
decrease in fuel oil consumption for autoproducer CHP. 
Consumption 
In  2018,  one  of  the  companies  changed  its  status  from  main  activity  producer 
CHP  plant  to  autoproducer  CHP  plant,  resulting  in  an  increase  in  fuel  oil 
consumption in the chemical and petrochemical industry. 
For gas/diesel oil, road data include rail use.  
Small  quantities  of  kerosene-type  jet  fuel  used  for  domestic  aviation  are 
included in international aviation bunkers data. 
Data for energy use of white spirit are not available.  
Natural gas 
General notes 
Data for losses were not available between 2009 and 2013. 
Between 1970 and 1971 and between 1978 and 1979, there are breaks in time 
series due to a revision of data for 1968-1969 and 1979-92 made in 2003. Data 
for 1970 were estimated by the Secretariat.

Supply 
In  2002  the  gross  calorific  value  (GCV)  of  production  increased  significantly  as 
extraction from a field with a low GCV ended.  
Imports include gas used for pipeline compressor stations.  
Transformation 
In  2014,  the  decrease  in  autoproducer  CHP  plants  consumption  was  due  to  a 
plant closure.  
Autoproducer electricity plants stopped operation in 2016. 
Amounts  in  non-specified  transformation  represent  natural  gas  used  for 
hydrogen manufacture. This hydrogen is used for hydrodesulphurization and for 
hydrocracking in oil refineries. 
Consumption 
In  2018,  following  a  change  in  the  nature  of  its  economic  activity  (as  per  the 
NACE  classification),  a  big  consuming  company  is  now  accounted  for  in  the 
natural gas consumption for the mining sector, leading to a substantial increase. 
In  2016,  non-energy  use  of  natural  gas  in  the  chemical  and  petrochemical 
industry decreased due to a two-month stoppage in ammonia production. 
In 2001, there is a break in time series for energy use in oil and gas extraction 
due to the application of the IEA’s definition starting that year. 
There are inconsistencies in the time series of commerce/public services as this 
sub-sector was computed as a residual. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
Prior  to  2001,  the  data  reported  as  industrial  waste  include  biogases  and 
municipal waste. 
Consumption 
Consumption  of  solid  biofuels  in  the  commercial  and  public  services  sector 
increased because there were many new reporting units.

Electricity and heat 
General notes 
Data for solar photovoltaic are available from 2010. 
Supply 
For 2018, heat supply declined due to the closure of a large producer in January 
2018. 
Electricity and heat from other sources refers to waste heat (flue gases). 
Transformation 
For  2020,  electricity  generation 
reported  under  main  activity  nuclear 
electricity-only  plants  is prior  years,  is  reported under  main  activity  CHP  plants. 
To improve consistency, data may be reallocated between plant types in a future 
cycle. 
For 2020, no municipal waste use is reported at autoproducer electricity plants 
or  autoproducter  heat  plants,  as  the  plants  reported  the  production  under 
autoproducer CHP. 
For  2020,  the  efficiency  of  production  using  other  bituminous  coal  at  main 
activity CHP plants is above the expected range. Conversely, for 2020 and 2019, 
the efficiency of heat production using biogas at main activity plants is far below 
the  expected  range.  The  Slovak  Administration  is  investigating  these  issues. 
Revisions are pending. 
For  2018,  opposing  trends  in  residual  fuel  oil  use  at  Autoproducer  and  Main 
CHP plants are due to changes in plant classifications following a merger. 
For 1990 to 2003, electricity and heat production from combustible fuels have 
been  estimated  based  on  the  data  on  fuel  inputs  to  electricity  and  heat  plants 
reported in the annual fuel questionnaires. 
Prior  to  2001,  electricity  generation  from  primary  solid  biofuels,  municipal 
waste and biogases are included with industrial waste.

Consumption 
For  2018,  the  apparent  decline  in  heat  consumption  in  the  oil  refineries  and 
chemical (incl. petrochemical) sectors is due to a merger between companies in 
those sectors and a CHP plant. 
For  2018,  the  increase  in  electricity  consumption  in  the  mining  and  quarrying 
sector is because a larger consumer was reclassified. 
The  low  electricity  consumption  in  oil  refineries  in  2003  and  2004  is  due  to  a 
change in ownership and work carried out on a refinery. 
Data for direct use of geothermal heat are available from 2001 and direct use of 
solar thermal heat from 2005.

Slovenia 
Source 
Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia, Ljubljana. 
General notes 
Breaks  in  the  time  series  appear  for  inputs  to  and  outputs  from  electricity 
generation  between  2017  and  2018  due  to  a  change  in  methodology.  This  is 
most  notable  for  lignite-fired  main  activity  producer  CHP  and  electricity-only 
plants.  Data  for  2018  onwards  are  reported  on  a  unit  basis,  whereas  data  for 
previous years are reported on a plant basis. 
A new energy data collection system was implemented in January 2001, causing 
some breaks in time series between 1999 and 2000. 
Data for Slovenia are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included in 
Former Yugoslavia. 
Coal 
Transformation 
From  2018,  there  is  a  change  in  methodology  for  reporting  CHP  generation 
which  reflects  in  new  figures  in  only-electricity  production.  Revisions  prior  to 
2018 are not expected. 
In  2015,  one  of  the  main  activity  electricity  plants  burning  lignite  ceased  its 
operations. 
Oil 
Supply 
Between  2013  and  2014,  a  break  in  imports  and  exports  time  series  for 
kerosene-type  jet  fuel  and  fuel  oil  appears  due  to  improvements  in  reporting 
methodology.  New  trade  corresponds  to  imports  that  are  first  stocked  on 
Slovenian territory and later re-exported.

Consumption 
In  the  2021  edition,  there  is  a  break  between  2017  and  2018  for  white  spirit 
whereby  consumption  is  reported  for  various  industry  sub-sectors  due  to  a 
change in reporting methodology by the Slovenian administration.  
Time series for motor gasoline and gas/diesel consumption in road fluctuate as 
they  are  computed  by  the  Slovenian  administration  as  residual  between  the 
supply and the total consumption of all other categories. 
Natural gas 
Transformation 
In  2014,  improvements  in  a  main  activity  producer  CHP  plant  resulted  in  a 
substantial reduction of natural gas consumption in this sector. 
Consumption 
In 2011, the decrease in the chemical and petrochemcal sector non-energy use 
consumption is due to minimal use of gas for production of methanol.  
There  are  inconsistencies  in  the  time  series  for  commercial/public  services  as 
this sub-sector is computed by the Slovenian administration as a residual. 
Biofuels and waste 
Consumption 
Increases  in  consumption  of  biodiesel  starting  from  2017  are  the  result  of  an 
amended energy policy, which went into effect in mid-2017. 
The  break  in  time  series  between  2008  and  2009  for  solid  biofuels  is  due  to 
revisions  based  on  a  new  household  survey  which  is  to  be  carried  out  on  an 
annual basis. 
Breaks in total final consumption for industrial waste prior to 2008 are a result 
of a sectoral reclassification.

Electricity and heat 
Supply 
Electricity  output  from  solar  only  includes  on-site  consumption  from  2019 
onwards. 
Transformation 
In  2018,  Slovenia  began  gradually  changing  the  sources  of  data  for  main  heat 
plants  from  questionnaires  to  administrative  sources.  This  change  has  resulted 
in some variation in reported efficiencies, in particular, for natural gas. 
Consumption 
Breaks  occur  between  2017  and  2018  for  electricity  consumption  data  (in 
particular,  for  Machinery  and  Construction)  due  to  a  change  in  the  sample 
frames and sample sizes used in surveys. 
Data on electricity consumption in Road are available from 2017. 
In  2017,  the  apparent  increase  in  electricity  consumption  in  Rail  is  due  to 
improved  data  provided  by  a  new  survey  launched  by  the  Ministry  of 
Infrastructure in 2018. 
Direct use of solar thermal and geothermal heat is available from 2009. 
Surveys for data on heat consumption are available from 2003 onwards for the 
residential,  industry  and  energy  sectors.  Prior  to  2003,  the  data  have  been 
estimated by the Slovenian administration.

Spain 
Source 
Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico, Madrid. 
General notes 
Spain  is  currently  working  on  improving  its  data  collection  system.  Therefore 
breaks  in  time  series  are  present  in  the  data  and  historical  revisions  are 
expected in future editions. 
Coal 
General notes 
The  calorific  values  for  sub-bituminous  coal  are  correct  on  an  as  received 
basis, and comply with definitions of sub-bituminous coal on a moist, but ash 
free basis. 
Supply 
Since 2019, capacity of coke oven coke production has decreased in Spain. As a 
consequence, the imports of coke oven coke have increased and the imports of 
coking coal have decreased. 
Hard  coal  mining  ceased  in  Spain  at  the  end  of  2018.  Consequently,  the 
production  figures  for  other  bituminous  coal,  sub-bituminous  coal  and 
anthracite are zero from 2019. 
Import and exports figures include transit trade. This affects specially anthracite. 
There is ongoing work to improve this situation. 
The main  coke  oven  coke  producer closed  in  2019,  which  meant  a  significant 
reduction  of  the  quantities  of  coke  oven  coke  produced.  This  also  affected  the 
coking coal imports. 
Lignite mining ceased in 2008. 
Underground production of sub-bituminous coal ceased in 2016.

Transformation 
Half  of  the  coal  power  plants  closed  in  Spain  in  June  2020.  Due  to  this  great 
reduction  of  the  coal  plants  in  Spain,  figures  in  transformation  have  decreased 
greatly, especially in Main Activy Producer and other bituminous coal. 
The  main  Main  Activity  Producer  plant  consuming  coke  oven  gas  has  had 
several  stops  within  2020,  which  have  affected  the  consumption  and  the 
efficiency figures. 
In 2018 edition, a reclassification of plants from autoproducer to main activity has 
led to breaks between 2015 and 2016. 
Consumption 
Iron  &  steel  production  slowed  down  in  2019.  As  a  result,  energy  consumption 
has decreased this year in electricity, natural gas and all coal products related to 
this sector (coking coal, coke oven coke, coke oven gas, blast furnace gas) 
In the  2021  edition,  blast furnace  (energy)  consumption  has  been  revised  back 
to 2003. 
Oil 
General notes 
A change in the reporting system occurred mid-1996 resulting in some breaks in 
time series. 
Supply 
The  rise  in  crude  production  in  2013  is  linked  with  the  development  of  the 
Montanazo-Lubina deep off shore field. 
Consumption 
Gas/diesel  oil  is  no  longer  used  in  coal  mines  due  to  the  cessation  of  coal 
mining production in 2020. 
A more detailed breakdown in some consumption time series appears between 
2012 and 2013 due to an update and improvement in the reporting methodology.

Natural gas 
General notes 
Spain  has  implemented  a  new  tool  in  data  collection,  so  there  are  currently 
breaks  in  the  time  series  for  2014  and  2015  in  transformation  and  industry 
respectively. 
Supply 
Starting in 2020, Spain was able to obtain information about international marine 
bunkers,  which  led  to  a  re-allocation  of  export  flows  initially  included  in  Non-
elsewhere Specified for the period of 2015 to 2019. 
In  2021  preliminary  data,  Exports  increased  due  to  gas  market  evolution  and 
more countries looking to other markets to diversify. 
Transformation 
The  increase  in  the  transformation  sector  consumption  for  2017  comes  from 
more  gas-fired  plants  being  used  to  compensate  decreased  hydro  generation 
due to a drought. 
Due  to  the  implementation  of  an  updated  tool  for  gathering  information  on 
electricity  generation  plants  in  2013  many  autoproducer  electricity  plants  were 
reclassified as autoproducer CHP plants. 
In  1997,  the  increase  in  input  to  main  activity  producer  electricity  is  due  to  two 
main activity producer electricity producers running on natural gas. 
Between  1993  and  1994  there  is  a  break  in  time  series  in  autoproducer  CHP 
plants  consumption,  since  a  new  survey  revealed  a  large  number  of  CHP 
autoproducers that were previously included in industry consumption. 
Since 1990 the decrease of natural gas inputs into gas works gas production is 
due to the substitution of natural gas by manufactured gas. 
Consumption 
Since  2001,  the  final  consumption  breakdown  is  estimated  by  the  Spanish 
administration.

Between  2005  and  2006  there  are  some  breaks  in  time  series  for  the  energy 
industry  own  use  and  for  final  consumption  due  to  a  change  in  the  estimation 
methodology. 
Since  1988  the  increase  of  natural  gas  used  as  feedstock  is  due  to  a 
substitution of naphtha for the production of fertilisers. 
Prior  to  1982  natural  gas  consumption  in  textiles  and  leather,  transportation 
equipment and machinery has been included in non-specified industry.  
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
Prior to 2018 data, other liquid biofuels data were included with solid biofuels. 
A revision of the historical time series is expected in the future. 
As  of  the  2020  edition,  the  reporting  methodologies  for  solid  biofuels  and 
biogases  are  under  review  by  the  Spanish  administration.  Revisions  are 
expected next cycle. 
Transformation 
In  the  2022  edition,  thanks  to  a  split  of  paper  industrial  waste  between 
renewable  and  non-renewable,  some  units reports  industrial  waste  in  electricity 
autoproducers.  For  this  reason,  in  2020  the  electricity  generation  increased 
greatly.  In  addition,  in  2020  a  CHP  plant  reported  generation  from  hydrogen 
produced  through  membrane  systems  using  salt  water  reservoirs.  This  product 
has been allocated to industrial waste since non-renewable electricity is used. It 
might be revised in future editions. 
Heat  production  from  renewable  sources  is  mostly  not  sold  to  third  parties  but 
rather,  used  for  industrial  purposes  or  consumed  by  heat  production  facilities. 
Revisions are expected next cycle which include some heat production. 
2017  is  the  first  year  that  data  are  available  for  the  blending  of  biogas  with 
natural gas. An update to the time series is expected in the future. 
Based  on  studies  from  the  Institute  of  Cork,  Wood  and  Charcoal  (IPROCOR), 
the efficiency of charcoal production plants is assumed to be 20%. 
From  2013  data,  a  revision  of  the  industry  sector  of  some  companies  causes 
breaks in time series for solid biofuels, municipal waste and biogases.

Consumption 
Increased  consumption  of  biofuels  from  2016  to  2017  is  a  result  of  increased 
demand for motor gasoline/diesel. 
Prior  to  2006,  inputs  of  biogases  used  to  generate  process  heat  were 
erroneously  included  as  inputs  to  transformation  when  they  should  have  been 
reported in the appropriate industry in final consumption. 
The breakdown of solid biofuels direct use in the industry sector prior to 1999 is 
not available. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply 
In  2019,  electricity  production  from    autoproducer  solar  increased  due  to 
implementation of a new regulation incentivising prosumption. 
As of the 2020 edition, the reporting methodologies for solid biofuels, biogases 
and  solar  thermal  are  under  review  by  the  Spanish  administration.  Revisions 
are expected next cycle. 
Electricity reported under other sources is from waste heat. 
Transmission  and  distribution 
losses  are  estimated  by 
the  Spanish 
administration. 
Data for electricity from solar thermal plants are available from 2007. 
Starting  in  2006,  a  new  method  was  used  to  estimate  the  losses  from  final 
consumption, resulting in a break in time series between 2005 and 2006. 
From  2005,  residential  rooftop  solar  photovoltaic  electricity  production  data, 
previously  reported  under  autoproducer,  are  included  in  main  activity  electricity 
plants according to the Spanish administration classification. 
Electricity  production  from  wind  and  solar  are  reported  from  1989  when  data 
became available. 
Transformation 
Industrial  waste 
generated from processing brine. 
inputs  to  autoproducer  CHP  plants 
include  hydrogen

Heat  production  from  renewable  sources  is  mostly  not  sold  to  third  parties  but 
rather,  used  for  industrial  purposes  or  consumed  by  heat  production  facilities. 
Revisions are expected in the 2021 edition which include some heat production 
from renewable sources. 
In  the  2020  edition,  electricity  generation  for  wind  was  revised  from  1998  – 
2017. 
From  2017  onwards,  more  accurate  data  on  inputs  and  outputs  for  pumped 
hydro  are  available.  This  improvement  in  data  quality  leads  to  an  apparent 
increase in efficiency.  
Prior  to  2018,  some  industrial  waste  and  other  liquid  biofuels  used  for 
electricity and heat generation was reported under solid biofuels.  
In 
the  2017  edition,  a  change 
in  reporting  methodology  resulting 
in 
reclassification of plants from autoproducer electricity to autoproducer CHP has 
led  to  breaks  in  electricity  production  in  autoproducer  electricity  plants  between 
2012  and  2013  and  2014  and  2015.  The  administration  anticipates  further 
revisions to the time series in subsequent cycles.  
The  National  Energy  Commission  reclassified  plants  that  consume  biogases, 
leading to breaks in time series between 2007 and 2008. 
In 2000 and 2006, many plants were reclassified from main activity producer to 
autoproducer or vice versa. 
For  2004  and  2005,  electricity  production  from  gas/diesel  oil  is  included  with 
fuel oil. 
The  large  increase  in  electricity  output  from  main  activity  producer  electricity 
plants fuelled by natural gas in 1997 is due to the opening of a new plant. 
Prior to 1989 inputs and outputs from the use of biofuels and waste to generate 
electricity  and/or  heat  (i.e.  comprising  solid  and  liquid  biofuels,  industrial 
waste,  municipal  waste  and  biogases)  are  reported  under  non-specified 
biofuels and waste. 
Prior  to  1987  electricity  production  in  main  activity  producer  CHP  plants  is 
included with production from main activity producer electricity plants. 
From 1983, net electricity production by autoproducers has been estimated by 
the  Spanish  administration,  and  includes  production  from  combustible  fuel

sources  only  and  net  electricity  production  by  autoproducer  CHP  plants  is 
included in electricity plants. 
Consumption 
For  2019  data,  some  electricity  consumption  was  reallocated  from  industry 
non-specified to other sectors. As a result, apparent increases are observed for 
sectors such as textiles and leather and wood and wood products. 
Electricity consumption by electric road transport vehicles includes battery and 
electric plug-ins, and is modelled based on vehicle registrations.  
For  2012,  the  electricity  consumption  data  are  estimated  by  the  Spanish 
administration.  
Data  for  direct  use  of  geothermal  and  solar  thermal  heat  are  available  from 
1990.  
Electricity  consumption  under  the  non-specified  industry  category  includes  the 
consumption for the manufacture of rubber and plastic products, furniture, repair 
and installation of machinery and equipment (except repair and maintenance of 
ships and boats) and other manufacturing. This aligns with the Classification of 
the Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE) group code 22 and 
31 to 33 (excluding class 33.15).

General notes 
Peat products data may be reported under the category of peat, particularly for 
imports. 
In  the  2021  edition,  there  was  a  revision  of  the  products  included  under  gas 
works gas. As a result, the figures for the years 2011 to 2018 were put to zero. 
Previously  this  product  included  some  mixture  of  LNG  with  air  to  form  a  lower 
calorie product. 
Autoproducer  inputs  to  waste  heat  production  that  are  sold  are  reported  in  the 
respective final consumption sectors and not in transformation. 
Supply 
Other  bituminous  coal  production  until  1992  is  coal  recovered  during  the 
quarrying of clay. 
Transformation 
The  figures  in  the  Transformation  section  for  the  products  coke  oven  gas  and 
blast  furnace  gas  were  estimated  until  2018;  from  2019  onwards  the  data  is 
obtained from surveys. 
Oil 
General notes  
In  2017  Statistics  Sweden  added  more  companies  to  their  new  data  collection 
system;  these  have  been  progressively  included  in  the  reporting  through  2018 
reference year data.

Swedish stock data include peacetime crisis stocks. Since these stocks may be 
held in crude oil instead of oil products, there may be occurrences of negative 
stock levels for products. 
Data are available from 2003 for refinery gas and from 2000 for additives and 
ethane. 
Beginning  in  2002,  Sweden  has  changed  some  of  the  conversion  factors  for 
some products. That explains the small breaks in time series between 2001 and 
2002. 
Supply 
In  2019,  outputs  of  several  oil  products  decreased  as  a  result  of  refinery 
shutdowns lasting two months. 
In  2018,  due  to  a  new  data  collection  survey  rolled  out  by  Statistics  Sweden 
which  has  a  higher  level  of  detail  available,  transfer  of  refinery  gas,  naphtha 
and fuel oil appear for the first time. Consequently, transfer of other products 
in 2018 dropped to zero. 
Quantities of receipts from other sources of other hydrocarbons correspond to 
natural gas used by refineries.  
Transformation 
In  2014,  gas/diesel  oil  inputs  to  main  activity  CHP  electricity  plants  are 
confidential and aggregated with fuel oil. 
In 2013 data, the drop in crude oil refinery intake is related with maintenance in 
August and September 2013 at the Swedish refineries. 
From 2011, the country’s gas works plants stopped using naphtha. 
Consumption 
In 2020, the Swedish administration confirmed that all refinery gas is consumed 
as refinery fuel. This change in reporting methodology possibly extends to 2018 
and revisions are expected. 
Starting  from  1995  data,  Sweden  has  changed  its  standard  classification  of 
industry sub-sectors 
Between 1985 and 1986, there are breaks in consumption time series of fuel oil 
due to more detailed reporting.

Transformation 
In  the  2021  edition,  there  was  a  revision  of  the  products  included  under  gas 
works gas. As a result, the figures for the years 2011 to 2018 were put to zero. 
Previously  this  product  included  some  mixture  of  LNG  with  air  to  form  a  lower

Autoproducer  inputs  to  waste-heat  production  that  are  sold  are  reported  in  the 
respective end-use sectors and not in the transformation sector. 
Consumption 
For 2013, data for the energy use of gas by oil refineries have been estimated by 
the IEA Secretariat. 
For  2008,  data  for  total  final  consumption  and  its  breakdown  have  been 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat based on other Statistics Sweden publications. 
For years prior to 1993, road transport is included in commercial/public services. 
Biofuels and waste  
General notes 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  administration  adopted  a  new  data  source  for  energy 
consumption  in  industry.  This  has  caused  breaks  in  the  time  series  and  the 
presence  of  new  flows  in  2020  in  particular  for  solid  biofuels,  other  liquid 
biofuels and biogases. 
New  data  in  the  2020  edition  for  biodiesel  in  industry,  transport  and  other 
sectors for 2005 – 2017 are related to a new survey.

There are some breaks in time series between 2015 and 2016 in pumped hydro, 
industrial waste and other liquid biofuels figures due to the lack of data. The 
figures are expected to be modified in the 2018 edition. 
From 1990 to 2006, municipal waste was reported as 60% non-renewable and 
40% renewable. In 2007, reanalysis of the waste revealed the content was 40% 
non-renewable  and  60%  renewable.  This  was  re-analysed  again  starting  from 
2016  data,  when  the  result  of  the  analysis  revealed  the  split  should  be  52% 
renewable  and  48%  non-renewable.  This  results  in  breaks  in  the  time  series 
between  2006  and  2007  and  also  2015  and  2016 for  both  renewable  and  non-
renewable municipal waste. 
In  the  2018  edition,  data  for  biodiesels  were  revised  from  2006  to  2015  while 
biogasoline  and  bioethanol  were  revised  from  2005  to  2015.  The  revisions 
affected indigenous production due to increased information about net trade, as 
well 
as 
the 
transformation 
sector, 
for 
blending  with  motor 
gasoline/diesel/kerosene and consumption in the road sector. 
Supply 
In  the  2022  edition,  for  industrial  waste  data  the  administration  adopted  the 
figures  from  the  survey  “Quarterly  Fuel  Statistic“    while  in  the  past  the  “Energy 
use in manufacturing industry“ was used. This led to a break in the time series 
between 2019 and 2020. 
Due to a change of tax regulations in 2017, it was no longer profitable to produce 
fatty  acid  methyl  ester  (FAME)  in  the  same  capacity  as  before,  so  there  was  a 
drop in biodiesel production. This drop in production was substituted by imports 
to meet increased demand. 
In  the  2018  edition,  trade  data  were  added  for  primary  solid  biofuels  starting 
from  2012.  As  the  net  trade  used  to  be  reported  together  with  indigenous 
production, this has resulted in a downward revision of indigenous production for 
2012-2015. 
Transformation 
In the  2022  edition,  electricity generation from industrial waste  is  reported  but 
no  capacity  installed  is  shown.  This  is  because industrial  waste  is  a  secondary 
product used in other non-specified plants.

Consumption 
In  the  2022  edition,  industrial  waste  consumption  in  the  industry  sector  non-
specified flow  appears for the first time.  Disaggregated  data  will  be  available  in 
future editions. 
In the  2021  edition,  there  are revisions  in  the  consumption  of  solid  biofuels  in 
the  agriculture/forestry  sector  starting  in  2005  resulting  in  a  break  in  series 
between  2004  and  2005.  These  revisions  remove  double  counting  with  the 
residential sector. 
Increased consumption of biogases in the industry sector in 2018 was because 
several industries switched from natural gas to biogases. 
Changes  in  tax  regulations  as  of  1  July,  2018  has  contributed  to  decreased 
consumption of biodiesel in 2018 data.  
Due to confidentiality issues, solid biofuels consumption in food, beverages and 
tobacco is reported with paper, pulp and printing for 2014 data. 
Consumption data by sector for biogases are available from 2011. 
In 2011 data, there was a change in the reporting methodology for consumption 
of  solid  biofuels  and  waste  in  the  residential  sector,  which  is  responsible  for 
breaks in time series between 2010 and 2011.  
For biogases, the residential sector is used as a residual. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply 
For 2021p, electricity and heat production data, are based on surveys which do 
not  have  the  same  coverage  as  the  annual  survey.  Therefore  data  are 
provisional  and  subject  to  revision.  In  particular,  due  to  this  difference  in 
coverage,  the  distribution  of  output  across  combustible  fuels  shows  breaks  in-
series compared with data for previous years. 
For 2020, the cessation of electricity output from autoproducer hydro was due to 
the plant no longer being classified in that category. 
In  the  2021  edition,  upward  revisions  were  applied  to  heat  production  and 
consumption back to 1997, to incorporate new data on recovered flue gas heat. 
Production is reported under heat from other sources.

For 2017 onwards, electricity inputs to and outputs from pumped hydro storage 
plants are based on a revised methodology. As a result, breaks occur between 
2016 and 2017. Prior to 2017, electricity inputs to mixed hydro storage plants are 
reported under pure pumped plants.  
Inputs  to  heat  pumps  include  heat  recovered  from  industry  and  from  ambient 
sources (including sewage and seawater). 
Ambient heat is shown as the indigenous production of heat. 
Information  on  heat  for  sale  produced  in  heat  pumps  and  electric  boilers  is 
available starting in 1992. 
Data  on  gross  electricity  production  are  sourced  from  an  annual  survey,  while 
net  production  is  sourced  from  monthly  surveys.  As  a  result,  implied  own  use 
may vary. 
Transformation 
For  2020,  the  decrease  in  electricity  output  from  other  bituminous  coal  was 
due to a plant closure. 
For 2020 onwards, the decrease in electricity output from nuclear is due to the 
closure of two reactors, one in late 2019, and another in late 2020. 
In Sweden, heat produced in heat pumps is sold to third parties (as district heat) 
and is therefore included in transformation. 
Heat  production  from  solid  biofuels  in  autoproducer  CHP  includes  waste  heat 
and chemical heat. 
For 2012 and 2013, small quantities of bio-methanol used to produce electricity 
are  included  in  other  liquid  biofuels,  under  production,  as  well  as  input  and 
output of autoproducer CHP. 
For 1997 and 1998, heat production from liquid fuels in main activity producer 
CHP plants includes heat recovered from flue-gas condensing. 
Prior  to  1992,  data  on  electricity  production  from  biogases  are  included  with 
solid biofuels. 
Heat produced for sale by autoproducer CHP plants is reported starting in 1992. 
From  1987,  the  breakdown  of  net  electricity  production  by  industry  for 
autoproducer electricity plants is available.

Prior to 1987 net electricity production by autoproducer plants includes data for 
CHP plants only. 
Prior  to  1980,  heat  produced  in  main  activity  producer  heat  plants  is  not 
available. 
Prior  to  1974,  heat  produced  in  main  activity  producer  CHP  plants  is  not 
available. 
Consumption 
Disaggregated data for industrial heat demand became available from 2020, due 
to  a  change  of  underlying  data  source.  This  lead  to  an  increase  in  reported 
demand  compared  with  previous  years.  The  Swedish  Administration  hopes  to 
revise the historical timeseries in a future cycle. 
Consumption  of  electricity  for  distribution  of  district  heat  is  included  with  other 
energy industry own use. 
In 2014,  consumption  of  electricity  in  the mining  and  quarrying  and  the  paper, 
pulp and printing sectors are confidential and were incorporated under the non-
specified industry sector. 
Data on direct use of solar thermal are available from 1989. 
Consumption of heat in industry and other sectors is available from 1984.

General notes 
From  1999,  data  on  consumption  result  from  a  new  survey  and  are  not 
comparable with data for previous years.  
Coal 
General notes 
Stock changes figures are not available for any product for 2019p. This data will 
be published in the following edition of this publication. 
Calorific values for anthracite, other bituminous coal and coke oven coke are 
taken from a common default figure. Calorific values for lignite are also default, 
but are based on dried lignite fines which have a higher calorific value. 
Consumption 
From  1985,  industrial  consumption  of  gas  works  gas  is  reported  in  non-
specified industry to prevent the disclosure of commercially confidential data. 
The  allocation  of  consumption  between  certain  coal  types  is  estimated  by  the 
Swiss administration. 
Natural gas 
General notes 
Since the 2019 edition, the non-specified other flow is calculated as residual flow 
for natural gas. Prior to this, the statistical differences used to be absorbed by 
agriculture/forestry.

Transformation 
Since 2013 there are fluctuations in gas consumption of main activity producers 
CHP plants due to the fuel flexibility of a plant. 
In  1996,  the  increase  of  gas  input  to  main  activity  CHP  plants  is  due  to  more 
complete accounting for all producing entities. 
Consumption 
Between 1977 and 1978, there are breaks in time series due to the introduction 
of a new survey by industry type. 
Oil 
General notes 
The  statistical  differences  for  gas/diesel  oil  are  partly  due  to  changes  in 
consumer stocks. 
In  2004,  petroleum  coke  production  started  due to  the  installation  of a  cracking 
unit in a refinery  
As  of  1993,  the  Swiss  administration  has  reported  figures  for  naphtha  that  are 
net  of  quantities  used  for  blending  into  motor  gasoline.  For  1994,  1995,  1997, 
1999, 2001 and 2002 this reporting has led to negative production numbers for 
naphtha. For these years, the IEA Secretariat has moved the data into transfers 
and reduced the production of motor gasoline by corresponding amounts.  
Supply 
There is a break in stocks between 2017 and 2018 for refinery feedstocks as 
more  detailed  information  of  refinery  activity  is  collected  by  the  national 
administration.  
In 2015, low refinery throughput is due to maintenance in May and June and to 
an  unplanned  outage  in  October  due  to  a  leak  in  a  heat  exchanger  at  the 
Cressier  refinery.  The  closure  of  the  Collombey  refinery  from  March  2015  also 
contributed. As a result, imports of many oil products increased in 2015.  
The Collombey refinery remained closed in 2016, resulting in decreased refinery 
throughput  and  increased  imports  in  this  year.  Refinery  output  of  petroleum 
coke stopped as this product was only produced at the Collombey refinery.

Data for refinery losses at the remaining Cressier refinery are low and are under 
investigation. 
Since  2013  oil  importers  are  obliged  to  compensate  parts  of  the  CO2  emission 
that  are  produced  by  the  transport  fuels  they  sell.  The  biofuel  components  are 
exempt  from  this  obligation,  which  together  with  tax  exemptions  on  biofuels, 
partly explains the increase in biofuel blending since. 
Transformation 
Gas/diesel  oil  non-specified  transformation  represents  inputs  to  mobile  and 
stationary  power  generators,  of  which  the  electricity  output  is  unknown  at  this 
stage. 
In  2012,  low  refinery  intake  is  due to the  temporary  shutdown  of the  refinery  in 
Cressier in the first semester of 2012 and maintenance at Collombey refinery.  
In 1988, the reduction in refinery intake of refinery feedstocks in 1988 is partly 
due  to  a  switch  to  crude  oil  and  partly  to  a  shutdown  for  maintenance  of  a 
refinery. 
Consumption 
In the 2022 edition, the Swiss administration revised data from 2012 onwards for 
road  diesel  consumption  in  rail  and  domestic  navigation  and  motor  gasoline 
consumption in domestic navigation. 
In the 2019 edition the Swiss administration revised data back to 1990 for road 
diesel  consumption  in  rail  and  domestic  navigation,  and  motor  gasoline 
consumption in domestic navigation.  
In 1994, the increase in consumption of gas/diesel oil is due to consumer stock-
building prior to the introduction of a value-added excise tax on heating fuels as 
of 1 January 1995.  
Biofuels and waste 
Supply 
Due  to  favourable  taxation  in  Switzerland,  the  imports  of  biodiesel  and 
bioethanol intended to be blended with oil products increased significantly from 
2016 to 2017.

Due to a new program launched in September 2014 in which CO2 emissions due 
to  traffic  can  be  compensated  by  substituting  fossil  gasoline  and  diesel  by 
biofuels,  the  imports  and  road  consumption  of  biodiesels  and  biogasoline 
increased sharply starting in 2015. 
Transformation 
In  the  2020  edition,  some  significant  revisions  were  in  industrial  waste  (non-
renewable)  from  2013  to  2015  for  fuel  input  to  autoproducer  CHP  plants 
because one plant operator corrected its fuel input. 
Consumption 
Starting  in  2018,  several  agricultural  biogas  plants  installed  a  system  to 
measure  heat  production.  Previously,  it  was  estimated.  Due  to  measurements, 
they realised they produce much more heat than estimated. This creates a break 
in series between 2017 and 2018 data.  
Consumption data for biogases in the transport sector are available from 1996 
to 2012 as a biogas fuel station had stopped selling biogas in 2013. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply 
Heat  production  includes  heat  produced  by  nuclear  power  stations  and 
distributed to other consumers. 
Data for electricity production from wind are available from 1996. 
Data for solar electricity production by autoproducers are available from 1990. 
Transformation 
For  2021,  the  decrease  in  electricity  output  from  nuclear  was  mainly  due  to 
maintenance works at the Leibstadt power plant.  
In the 2020 edition, some significant revisions were made to input of industrial 
waste (non-renewable) to autoproducer CHP plants, for 2013 to 2015, because 
one plant operator corrected its fuel input. 
For 2019, gross heat production from heat pumps ceased following a decline in 
2018.  Two  such  facilities  existed  in  Switzerland,  the  larger  of  which  closed  in 
2018, followed by the smaller in 2019.For 2016 and 2017, electricity output from

nuclear sources declined due to shut downs at two of Switzerland’s five nuclear 
power plants (Beznau 1 and Leibstadt). For 2018, output increased due to higher 
availability at these two plants. 
Electricity  used  for  pumped  storage  (pure  hydro  pumping  plants)  is  included 
under used for pumped storage (mixed plants). 
In 2016, two new pumped hydroelectric plants went into operation.  
For  2015,  the  large  decline  in  electricity  and  heat  production  from  industrial 
waste  is  due  to  one  large  main  activity  CHP  plant  significantly  reduces  their 
activity.  This  plant  eventually  closed  in  2016,  further  lowering  electricity  and 
heat generation for this fuel.  
From  2012,  the  municipal  waste  autoproducer  plant  previously  reported  as 
electricity plant met the CHP requirements and was reclassified as such. 
Biogas is no longer being used for heat production as of 2011. 
The  decrease  in  the  use  of  natural  gas  in  main  activity  CHP  plants  in  2007  is 
caused by the reduced operation of one plant after the start-up of a new waste-
incineration plant and the shutting down of another plant. Use increases again in 
2008 due to the re-starting of a district heating plant. 
The autoproducer heat plant that produced heat for sale using municipal waste 
was closed in 2006. 
The breakdown of electricity and heat generation from autoproducers by sector 
is only partially available from 1990-1999, and is not available 2000-2018. 
Prior to 1978, data for heat output from CHP plants are not available. 
The  allocation  of  electricity  production  in  main activity  producer  electricity  only 
and CHP plants between 1967 and 1973, and in main activity producer CHP and 
autoproducer CHP plants in 1974 are Secretariat estimates. 
All hydro electricity production is reported under large scale hydro (> 10 MW) 
due  to  the  fact  that  production  data  are  not  being  collected  by  different  size 
capacity categories. 
Consumption 
Consumption in the transport equipment industry is included with machinery.

Geothermal  direct  use  is  overstated  as  it  refers  to  heat  production  by 
geothermal heat pumps, which include inputs from electricity and/or gas in the 
transformation process. 
The  breakdown  of  final  consumption  of  electricity  in  the  industry  sector  from 
2000 to 2001 was estimated by the Secretariat. 
Data  for  direct  use  of  geothermal  heat  and  solar  thermal  heat  are  available 
from 1990.

General notes 
In the 2018 edition, revisions were conducted by the Turkish administration back 
to  1990  impacting  the transformation  and  industrial  sector. The revisions  in  the 
transformation  sector  were  the  result  of  new  data  submitted  by  the  Turkish 
Electricity Transmission Company (TECT).  
In  the  2017  edition,  historical  revisions  on  coal  tar  data  were  conducted  by  the 
Turkish administration due to new available information. 
Data from 2012 onwards utilised the latest census data, causing breaks in time 
series between 2011 and 2012. 
Data  from  2008  are  provided  from  the  results  of  an  improved  questionnaire. 
Significant  changes  occur  in  consumption  patterns  within  the  iron  and  steel 
industry,  coal  mining  as  well  as  across 
commercial/public services for other bituminous coal. 
industry, 
residential  and 
Calorific  values for fuels  used for  electricity,  CHP  and  heat  plants  are  obtained 
from data submitted to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) by 
the  Turkish  Electricity  Transmission  Company,  and  these  values  may  differ 
significantly  from  production  and  import  values  provided  by  MENR,  causing 
imbalances for some years. 
Production  of  gas  works  gas  declined  in  1989  due  to  plant  closures;  the  last 
plant closed in 1994. Use of gas coke and gas works gas ceased in 1994. 
Due to government regulations in industry and residential, in particular, there has 
been  a  shift  from  the  use  of  domestically  produced  coal  to  imported  coal  and 
natural gas.

Transformation 
In the middle  of  2014, most  autoproducer  plants  in Turkey  were  reclassified  as 
main activity producer due to a change in the legislation. Amongst other things, 
this  brought  the  reporting  of  unsold  heat  and  prorated  inputs  in  line  with  IEA 
methodology. 
Consumption 
In the 2018 edition, revisions on industrial coal consumption were conducted by the 
Turkish administration back to 2010 due to new available information. 
Privatisation  of  state  owned  coke  ovens  in  recent  years  results  in  incomplete 
information on coke oven gas distribution. 
In  the  2017  edition,  consumption  of  sub-bituminous  coal  in  construction  has 
been  reclassified  by  the  Turkish  administration  as  consumption  in  the  non-
metallic minerals industry.  
In  2015,  a  new  survey  was  introduced  by  the  Turkish  administration  to  collect 
more  detailed  industrial  consumption  data,  resulting  in  breaks  in  time  series 
between 2014 and 2015. 
Oil  
General notes 
A  project to  upgrade the  İzmit refinery  was  completed  in  2015. This  resulted  in 
considerably  higher  refinery  throughout  in  2015,  compared  to  previous  years. 
The project included a new unit to convert high sulphur fuel oil into higher grade 
products,  such  as  gas/diesel  oil  and  motor  gasoline,  and  producing  petroleum 
coke as a by-product.  
In the 2016 edition, the Ministry of Energy revised time series for kerosene-type 
jet  fuel  from  2013.  Sales  to  foreign  airlines,  previously  accounted  for  under 
exports,  are  now  reported  under  international  aviation  according  to  the  IEA 
methodology. Data could not be revised for prior years. Exports of jet kerosene 
up to 2012 years may include international aviation consumption. 
In  the  2016  edition, the Ministry  of  Energy  revised  crude  oil  net  calorific  values 
from 2010 due to a new methodology for calculating them.

Production 
(natural  gas)  of  other  hydrocarbons 
corresponds  to  hydrogen  used  in  refineries,  also  represented  as  the  output  of 
from  other  sources 
non-specified transformation in the balances format. 
From 2013, marine fuels are reported under fuel oil instead of gas/diesel oil. 
From 2012, petroleum coke data are reported. 
Supply 
In  2019,  the  increase  in  refinery  throughput  is  due  to  the  start-up  of  the  new 
STAR refinery.  
In 2018 Izmir refinery underwent maintenance for several months impacting the 
overall throughput quantities.  
In  2014,  the  drop  in  lubricants  imports  and  consumption  is  related  to  a 
legislation change effective 1st of January 2014 regarding base oil imports. 
From 2012, new information on additives imports (MTBE) data became available. 
From  2012,  no  exports  breakdown  is  available  for  white  spirit,  lubricants, 
bitumen and other products. 
From  2010  data,  more  accurate  NCVs  for  crude  oil  are  available  due  to  the 
implementation of a new survey. 
For  the  years  1978,  1980,  1981,  1983,  1984,  international  marine  bunkers  are 
included in exports.  
Transformation 
Gas/diesel oil and fuel oil consumed to produce electricity are used in both oil 
and coal-fired plants. 
Consumption 
Consumption of biodiesel for road transport increased in 2018 due to legislation 
coming into effect on 1 January 2018, which enforced a 0.5% blending obligation 
for gas/diesel oil. 
In the 2019 edition consumption of petroleum coke was reclassified from non-
energy to energy use.

For the 2015 data, new surveys were used to create a more detailed breakdown 
of the industry and other sectors. This led to breaks in time series between 2014 
and 2015. 
From 2014, information on gas/diesel consumption in fishing is available.  
From  2013,  additional  information  on  petroleum  coke  cement  consumption  is 
available.  
Prior  to  2012,  consumption  of  other  oil  products  in  the  chemical  sector  was 
included under non-specified industry.  
Between  2010  and  2011,  breaks  in  consumption  time  series  for  LPG,  motor 
gasoline and gas/diesel oil appear due to improved survey methods. 
Between 1977 and 1978, the end-use classification of gas/diesel oil and fuel oil 
were changed in the Turkish national statistics resulting in breaks in time series. 
Natural gas 
Supply 
Exports reported by the Turkish administration represent transit gas. 
In  2008,  there  is  a  break  in  time  series  for  stock  changes  due  to  a  revision  of 
storage capacity data. 
In  December  2016,  the  first  Floating  Storage  and  Regasification  Unit  (FSRU) 
terminal started to work, allowing thus greater import quantities and stock levels. 
Transformation 
Non-specified  transformation  of  natural  gas  represents  amounts  used  to 
produce hydrogen for hydrocracking in refineries. 
In the 2018 edition, Turkish administration revised 2014 and 2015 data, as some 
main activity producing plants in Turkey were reclassified as autoproducers. 
Consumption 
In  2015,  a  new  survey  was  introduced  by  the  Turkish  administration  to  collect 
industrial  consumption  data, resulting  in  a  substantial  decrease  of  consumption 
reported under non-specified industry.

In  2013,  energy  use  of  natural  gas  in  blast  furnaces  was  zero,  as  gas  was 
replaced by coal and coke. 
From  2009,  there  are  some  breaks  in  time  series  across  all  sectors,  as 
consumption  data  started  being  collected  by  a  different  institution,  the  Turkish 
Energy Market Regulatory Authority. 
In  2006,  there  is  a  break  in  time  series  for  non-energy  use  in  chemical  and 
petrochemical industry due to improvements in the classification. 
Prior  to  2000,  data  for  commercial/public  services  were  included  in  the 
residential sector. 
Between  1999  and  2001, 
the  decrease 
in  natural  gas  chemical  and 
petrochemical feedstocks is linked to the activity of the fertiliser industry. 
Since  1988,  data 
for  natural  gas  consumption 
in 
the  chemical  and 
petrochemical industry (for fertilisers) and in non-specified industry (dye industry) 
are available. 
Non-specified  industry  includes  the  natural  gas  distributed  by  OIZ  (Organised 
Industrial Zones). 
Biofuels and waste  
General notes 
The  Turkish  administration  only  intermittently  surveys  renewables  and  waste 
used  for  power  and  heat.  Due  to  this  fact,  some  breaks  may  appear  in  the 
biofuels and waste time series. 
Transformation 
Biodiesel  blending  with  diesel  increased  in  2018  because  there  was  a  new 
policy requiring that diesel be blended with 5% biodiesel. 
In 2017, the increase in electricity production in main activity producers burning 
solid biofuels is related to new plants. 
Consumption 
Starting with 2018 data, new sub-sector data in the industry sector for industrial 
waste  (non-renewable)  and  solid  biofuels  is  available  as  a  result  of  a  new 
survey. Backward revisions will not be available in the future.

Prior  to  1998,  consumption  in  the  wood  and  wood  products  sector  includes 
that of the paper, pulp and printing industry. 
Electricity and heat 
Supply 
Other  sources  heat  production  represents  recovered  waste  heat  (steam)  from 
industry,  mainly  from  cement  and  glass  manufacturing,  while  other  sources 
electricity is the proportion of generation by plant obtained from this heat. 
Electricity production from wind is available starting in 1998. 
Transformation 
In  2020, the  decline  in  electricity  production from  lignite  was  due  to  temporary 
plant closures for environmental refits. 
In  2017,  the  increase  in  electricity  production  from  solar  PV  main  activity 
producers is related to new plants coming online, mostly unlicensed.  
In the 2006 edition, the Turkish Statistical Office started providing electricity and 
heat output on the basis of a new survey that revised time series back to 2000. 
This  causes  breaks  in  the  time  series  between  1999  and  2000.  Not  all  of  the 
input time series have been revised. 
A new gas-fired main activity producer CHP plant was put into operation in 1999 
and  a  new  autoproducer  electricity  plant  fuelled  with  coking  coal  started  in 
2000. 
Data for blast furnace gas for electricity and heat generation are available from 
1995. 
Data on electricity generated from biofuels are available from 1991. 
In 1995, the Turkish administration reclassified autoproducer plants by type and 
source to  be  consistent with  IEA  definitions. This  causes  breaks  between  1994 
and 1995 for electricity production, most notably in plants fuelled by biogases. 
Consumption 
Prior  to  2014,  consumption  data  in  the  machinery  sector  includes  transport 
equipment.

Coal 
General notes 
In the 2021 edition, BEIS revised the coal production by type (other bituminous 
coal and coking coal) as a result of an update of their models. The revisions go 
back to 2016 and reallocate some production quantities from other bituminous 
coal  to  coking  coal.  Some  adjustments  were  done  on  TFC/Industry/  Not 
elsewhere  specified  to  adjust  the  statistical  difference  to  the  new  production 
figures. 
Oxygen steel furnace gas data are reported with blast furnace gas rather than 
as other recovered gases. 
In  the  2017  edition,  calorific  values  of  other  bituminous  coal  were  revised  for 
the period 2002-2015 due to a change in the methodology, impacting all flows.  
Prior to 1994, the consumption of substitute natural gas is included with natural 
gas while its production is included with gas works gas.  
Supply 
Underground production of coking coal increased in 2019 as Aberpergwm mine 
came back into operation in September 2018. 
Underground  production  of  other  bituminous  coal  in  2016  decreased  due  to 
the closure of Hatfield, Thoresby and Kellingley mines. 
Transformation 
The  consumption  of  solid  biofuels  increased  in  2015,  as  the  largest  power 
station in the UK converted a further unit from coal to biomass midyear, and the 
previously converted unit had a full year of operation in 2015 rather than just the 
last few months of 2014.

The  market  decline  in  use  of  other  bituminous  coal  from  2013  onwards  for 
autoproducer electricity generation was due to a plant being sold to a dedicated 
main-activity electricity producer. 
Consumption 
Consumption shown for the commercial/public services includes consumption of 
some of non-specified other. 
Oil 
General notes 
There  is  a  break  in  series  between  2015  and  2016  due  to  a  change  in 
methodology  and  estimation  process  applied  by  the  UK  administration  in  the 
2020 edition, which involves including data from trade body members and major 
suppliers.  
Breaks in time series occur for LPG between 2007 and 2008 due the inclusion of 
additional information from the petrochemical sector.  
For  international  marine  bunkers  and  domestic  navigation,  a  different  bunkers 
methodology  is  applied  from  2008,  in  line  with  UK’s  National  Atmospheric 
Emissions  Inventory.  From  2013  onwards,  improved  data  are  available  for 
international marine bunkers. Deliveries to international marine bunkers may be 
underestimated in previous years. 
For  consumption  of  oil  products,  the  UK  administration  revised  its methodology 
from 2008 to better track consumption of imported oil products and domestically 
refined oil products sold through third parties to final consumers.  
Breaks  in  time  series  appear  in  2013  for  ethane,  naphtha,  white  spirit, 
lubricants,  bitumen,  petroleum  coke  and  other  oil  products,  as  new 
information became available on the energy use of these products.  
Supply 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  UK  administration  revised  the  stock  levels  (national 
territory) of motor gasoline and gas/diesel oil from 2015 onwards, resulting in 
a stock break between 2014 and 2015. 
Refinery  output  of  ethane  decreased  in  2019  due  to  the  closure  of  the 
Mossmorran NGL plant.

Biodiesel  blending  notably  increased  in  2019  per  the  requirement  of  the 
Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation. 
Indigenous  production  of  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  liquids  increased  in  2018 
primarily due to multiple new projects coming online at the end of 2017. 
Refinery  output  of  total  oil  products  decreased  in  2018  due  to  relatively  high 
levels of maintenance throughout 2018.  
From 2008 data on naphtha and motor gasoline better reflects the blending of 
these products. Breaks in series may appear between 2007 and 2008.  
Between 2007 and 2008 breaks in time series appear for NGL as a result of the 
UK  administration  obtaining  additional  information  on  the  destination  of  some 
upstream NGL. Previously classified as exports, these amounts now appear as 
transfers, mainly to LPG, then as consumption in the petrochemical sector.  
Between 2002 and 2004 products transferred include backflows and interproduct 
transfers. From 2005 onwards backflows are estimated by the UK administration.  
Condensates are reported in NGL from 1980 and in crude oil until 1979.  
LPG includes ethane until 1980.  
Other  hydrocarbons,  reported  until  1994,  correspond  to  bitumen  production 
from coal. 
Consumption 
Breaks  in  time  series  may  occur  in  the  consumption  of  gas/diesel  oil  between 
2011  and  2012,  following  the  UK’s  administration  improved  access  to  customs 
trade data, in particular duty figures for demand in agriculture. 
Natural gas 
General notes 
In  the  2020  edition,  revisions  were  made  to  years  2017  and  2018  to  align  with 
the DUKES publications. 
Since  1992,  distribution  losses  include  metering  differences  and  losses  due  to 
pipeline leakage.

Supply 
In the 2018 edition, UK administration revised the supply balance back to 2008 
to  update  Norwegian  imports  from  two  terminals  previously  reported  as 
indigenous production. 
In 2002, the increase in imports is due to increased supplies from the Norwegian 
sector of the North Sea through the Vesterled pipeline, which was commissioned 
in the 4th quarter of 2001. 
In  2017  data  the  decreased  closing  stock  level  is  related  to  the  cessation  of 
storage operations in Rough, UK’s single largest storage facility.  
Transformation 
The natural gas reported in coke-oven (transformation) is used to form synthetic 
coke oven gas rather than undergoing a coking process. 
Consumption 
In  the  2018  edition,  natural  gas  consumption  in  the  sectors  of  industry, 
residential,  commercial/public  services,  was  revised  back  to  2008  to  include 
information from other data sources such as the Purchases Inquiry, EU ETS and 
ONS Index of Services and Production. 
In the  2019  edition, the UK  administration  proceeded to revisions  back to  2015 
based on improved data from the Purchases Inquiry annual survey of the Office 
of National Statistics (ONS). 
Before  2008,  the  commercial  sector  consumption  is  included  in  non-specified 
other, while that of public services is shown separately.  
Between  2007  and  2008  there  are  some  breaks  in  time  series  in  sectoral 
consumption due to a new methodology of data estimation. 
Natural gas consumption includes substitute natural gas made at gas works and 
piped into the natural gas distribution system. 
Non-specified  industry  represent  to  sales  by  independent  gas  suppliers 
unallocated by category.  
Consumption  by  the  mining  and  quarrying  and  the  wood  and  wood  products 
sectors is included in non-specified industry.

Non-specified  energy  includes  gas  used for  heating  and  pumping  operations  in 
the distribution network. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
In      the  2021  edition,  revisions  from  2015  onward  in  municipal  wastes  were 
reflect  a  reclassification  from  non-renewable  to  renewable  based  on  the 
renewable portion of tires.  
In  the  2017  edition,  the  UK  government  revised  the  data  time  series  for 
municipal waste  and  solid  biofuels  back  to  2001.  As  a  result,  breaks  in  time 
series may occur between 2000 and 2001. 
Transformation 
From  2015,  the  UK  administration  started  collecting  data  from  the  main-activity 
solar PV companies. Prior to this, all data were included under autoproducers. 
The consumption of solid biofuels has increased in 2015, as the largest power 
station in the UK halfway through the year converted a further unit from coal to 
biomass, plus the previously converted unit had a full year of operation in 2015 
rather than just the last few months of 2014. 
Prior  to  2013,  due  to  data  confidentiality  reasons,  one  or  two  main-activity 
municipal  waste  plants  had  to  be  included  within  the  autoproducer  plant 
category. Since 2013, as there have been at least three main-activity companies, 
these  plants  have  been  reclassified  from  autoproducer  plant  to  main  activity 
electricity  plant,  with  some  CHP  plants  included  under  main  electricity  due  to 
confidentiality reasons.  
Consumption 
In the 2022 edition, solid biofuels data were revised back to 2008. This causes 
breaks in time series between 2007 and 2008. 
In 
the  2021  edition,  solar  thermal  reclassifications 
from  residential 
to 
commercial  and  public  services  in  2016  –  2018  represent  new  data  on  heating 
for public swimming pools.

In  the  2020  edition,  there  are  some  unusual  patterns  in  the  industry  sector  for 
municipal  wastes  and  solid  biofuels,  however  revisions  are  expected  in  the 
following cycle. 
In  the  2018  edition,  following  a  review  of  the  consumption  of  biogases  and 
municipal  wastes  for  2015  and  2016  data,  data  that  were  allocated  to  other 
sectors have been reallocated to the industry sectors. This has caused a break 
in time series between 2014 and 2015.  
Electricity and heat 
General notes 
For  the  United  Kingdom,  it  is  necessary  to  combine  figures  for  main  activity 
producers  and  autoproducers  in  order  to  prevent  the  disclosure  of  information 
relating to less than three electricity generating companies, since this information 
is considered confidential. For this reason, data for main activity producer CHP 
plants  have  been  included  with  autoproducer  CHP  plants  from  1988.  Prior  to 
1988,  electricity  output  from  CHP  plants  was  included  with  autoproducer 
electricity plants. 
The  re-organisation  and  subsequent  privatisation  of  the  electricity  supply 
industry in 1990 has resulted in some breaks in time series. 
Supply 
Data for off-grid solar PV are currently not available in the United Kingdom but 
the addition of this data is expected in the future. 
Large declines in electricity generation from coal-fired power since 2013 are due 
to  concrete  plans  to  phase  out  coal  use  for  electricity  generation  entirely  by 
2025. Alternative generation has been supplied by increases from other sources, 
including  biomass,  natural  gas,  nuclear,  solar  and  wind  generation,  and 
increases in imports through undersea HVDC interconnectors. 
Electricity production data for solar PV are available from 1999. 
The launch of a feed-in-tariff scheme in April 2010 resulted in a rapid increase of 
capacity  and  corresponding  electricity  production  growth  from  solar  PV  in  the 
following years. 
In  1996,  the  break  in  electricity  production  from  nuclear  is  due  to  a 
reclassification of plants from autoproducer to main activity producer plants.

Data on electricity production from wind are available from 1989. 
Transformation 
In  the  2022  edition,  electricity  generation  from  autoproducer  wind  plants  was 
revised between 2018 and 2019. In 2019, a peak is visible because a large plant 
was recorded as an autoproducer and in 2020 it was classified as a main activity 
producer. The reason for this is that the plant was not covered by the survey of 
major  power  producers  until  2020,  therefore  administrative  data  were  used  in 
2019. 
For  2021,  the  decrease  in  electricity  output  from  nuclear  was  due  to  a  high 
number of outages, and the commencement of defuelling at Dungeness B.  
For 2019 onwards, the decline in output from other bituminous coal was due to 
plant closures (Fiddlers Ferry, Cottam, and Aberthaw). 
For 2018-2020, the decrease in electricity output from nuclear was due to plant 
outages for maintenance. 
Electricity  used  for  pumped  storage  (mixed  plants)  is  included  under  used  for 
pumped storage (pure hydro pumping plants) for confidentiality reasons. 
In 2007, outputs of electricity from petroleum coke are included in fuel oil. 
Prior to 2003, all outputs of electricity and heat from oil products are reported in 
the other oil products category. 
Heat production from autoproducers is available starting in 1999. 
Inputs  and  output  from  natural  gas  for  main  activity  producer  electricity 
production  are  included  in  autoproducer  electricity  for  1990  (for  reasons  of 
confidentiality). 
Consumption 
For  the  2019  edition,  a  change  in  methodology  was  applied  for  heat 
consumption figures from  2015  onwards.  Due to  new  information  regarding  the 
purchasing  and  reselling  of  heat,  consumption  previously  included  under  the 
Commercial and Public services sector was reallocated to the Residential sector.  
For 2017, the decrease in electricity consumption in mining and quarrying is due 
to omission of one company from dataset.

Prior  to  2010,  consumption  in  mining  and  quarrying  is  included  in  the  non-
metallic minerals sector. 
Electricity  consumption  in  coal  mines  includes  consumption  in  patent  fuel 
plants. 
Data  for  electricity  consumption  in  transport  was  classified  by  sub-sector  only 
starting  from  2004  resulting  in  a  break  in  time  series  between  2003  and  2004. 
Prior to 2004, non-specified transport includes consumption for traction by urban 
rails  and  road  vehicles,  and  consumption  for  non-traction  by  railways  and  bus 
stations  and  airports.  From  2004  onwards,  road  vehicles  consumption  is 
included under road transport. Prior to 2004, electricity consumption in rail refers 
to  industrial  rail  only.  From  2004  onwards  it  includes  both  industrial  and  urban 
rail. 
Consumption  in  the  machinery  sub-sector  includes  that  of  the  transport 
equipment industry before 1996. 
Starting  in  1990,  small  amounts  of  electricity  used  in  heat  pumps  have  been 
included in residential. 
From  1984  onwards,  the  electricity  consumption  in  the  non-specified  industry 
sector  includes  that  of  the  wood  and  wood  products  sub-sector  (except  2010-
2014,  when  estimates  were  supplied  bu  the  UK)  and  unallocated  consumption. 
The unallocated consumption comes from data reported as ‘Other industries’ by 
companies and includes Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes 7, 22, 31, 
32, 33.19, 36, 38.3. 
Electricity consumption in energy non-specified sub-sector is primarily made up 
of  ‘gas  and  electricity  supply’  and  includes  Standard  Industrial  Classification 
(SIC)  codes  24.46  and  35.  However,  prior  to  1990,  consumption  in  gas  works 
includes electricity use in the transmission/distribution of public supply gas. 
For  autoproducers,  due  to  data  availability  constraints,  heat  is  assumed  to  be 
consumed within the same sector as it is generated.

US Energy Information Administration, Washington D.C. 
General notes 
Starting  with  2017  data,  inputs  to  and  outputs  from  electricity  and  heat 
generation include Puerto Rico. 
End-use energy consumption data for the United States present a break in time 
series with historical data due to a change in methodology in 2014. The break in 
time series occurs between 2011 and 2012 for oil; and between 2001 and 2002 
for  electricity  and  natural  gas.  The  new  methodology  is  based  on  the  last 
historical  year  of  the  most  recent  Annual  Energy  Outlook  (AEO)  publication. 
Changes  occur  primarily  in  reported  end-use  energy  consumption  in  the 
industrial sector and its subsectors, including the non-manufacturing industries of 
mining,  construction  and  agriculture.  Historical  revisions  are  pending.  Due  to 
other  changes  in  reporting  methodologies,  there  are  numerous  breaks  in  time 
series  for  the  US  data,  particularly  in  1992,  1999,  2001,  2002  and  2013.  Care 
should  be  taken  when  evaluating  consumption  by  sector  since  inputs  of  fuel  to 
autoproducers  are  included  in  final  consumption  for  some  years.  No  data  are 
available for most energy products in the construction and mining and quarrying 
industries.  
Coal 
General notes 
The statistical  difference for  anthracite  is significant for  some  parts  of  the  time 
series  as  some  consumption  falls  below  the  reporting  thresholds,  such  as 
residential  usage.  Additionally,  some  anthracite  is  exported  blended  with  other 
bituminous coal, and reported with the other fuel. 
From  the  2022  edition,  coke  oven  gas  and  blast  furnace  gas  production  and 
most consumption data are no longer available due to confidentiality. 
Since  the  Energy  Information  administration  (EIA)  and  the  US  Department  of 
Commerce do not collect separate data on patent fuel exports by country, total 
exports  data  of  patent  fuel  are  included  in  the  exports  of  other  bituminous 
coal.

Coal tar as a by-product of coke ovens is not currently reported. 
In  2002,  the  United  States  reported  “synfuel”  production  as  patent  fuel  for  the 
first  time.  Prior  to  2002,  the  consumption  of  this  fuel  was  reported  with  other 
bituminous coal. Production ceased in 2007 for economic reasons. 
Hard coal data prior to 1978 may include sub-bituminous coal. 
Supply 
Other  sources  coal  production  represents  coal  production  that  does  not  have 
a Mine Health and Safety Administration (MSHA) identifier.  
Other  bituminous  coal  exports  could  include  some  anthracite  quantities. 
Anthracite is often blended with bituminous coal when exported. 
Transformation 
Anthracite  calorific  values  for  Main  Activity  &  Other  Uses  is  mainly  Anthracite 
waste coal. As such heat content is much lower than expected for this product. 
Coking coal calorific values for coke ovens and blast furnaces are reported by 
most  data  providers  on an  “dry  heat  content”  basis  rather  than  on  an “as  is”  or 
“as received” basis. As such, they are on the higher end of the range expected 
for this product. 
Oil 
General notes 
In the 2018 edition, the US administration revised data back to 2011 for several 
products owing to the introduction of a number of methodological changes. This 
results  in  a  number  of  breaks  in  the  time  series  between  2010  and  2011, 
particularly in the consumption data.  
From  2011  onwards,  olefins  are  reported  under  other  oil  products  instead  of 
LPG. 
Breaks  in  time  series  due  to  methodology  improvements  and  newly  available 
information  to  the  US  administration  also  appear  in  historical  data:  in  1990  for 
fuel  oil  (new  methodology  for  marine  bunkers);  in  1992  for  LPG/NGL  (specific 
densities);  in  1993  for  oxygenates  (new  collection  system  to  accommodate  the 
revised  Clean  Air  Act);  in  1994  for  motor  gasoline  (new  model  from  the  US 
Department  of  Transportation);in  1999-2000  for  industry  consumption  (new

available  data  from  the  2002  MECS  survey);  in  2001  for  fuel  oil  (changes  in 
methodology  for  classifying  imports  of  unfinished  oils)  and  in  2011  for  refinery 
gas (new density). 
Supply 
The  US  administration reports  stocks  of  crude oil  held  in  the  United  States  on 
behalf of Australia under official agreement in 2020. 
Receipts  (from  non-specified  sources)  and  trade  of  additives/oxygenates  in 
2020  are  not  available  as  the  EIA  no  longer  collects  information  on  ETBE  and 
MTBE.  
In  the  2021  edition,  receipts  from  other  sources  and 
total  exports  of 
additives/oxygenates  have  been  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  for  2019 
based on information in the IEA Monthly Annual Oil Statistics.  
In  the  2021  edition,  the  refinery  gross  output  of  motor  gasoline  has  been 
estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  for  2019  based  on  information  in  the  IEA 
Monthly Annual Oil Statistics. 
In the 2021 edition, deliveries of gas/diesel oil for international marine bunkers 
have  been  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  for  2019  based  on  information 
provided by the EIA. 
Deliveries to international marine bunkers of gas/diesel oil have been estimated 
by the IEA Secretariat for 2016 and 2017 based on information provided by the 
EIA.  
In the 2018 edition, the breakdown of exports by destination of low sulphur fuel 
oil and high sulphur fuel oil is not available. The time series was revised back to 
2011.  
Completion  of  the  Utopia  pipeline  from  Ohio  to  Ontario  has  facilitated  more 
ethane exports to Canada in 2018.  
High  statistical  differences  for  crude  oil  represent  “unaccounted  for  crude  oil”, 
the difference between the supply and disposition of crude oil.  
From 2013, the US administration reports exports of refinery feedstocks, some 
of which were previously reported under white spirit and SBP.  
Stocks changes for gas/diesel oil, fuel oil and petroleum coke were estimated 
by the IEA Secretariat from 1996 onwards to include stock changes at utilities.

Transformation 
From 2002 onwards, the IEA Secretariat has estimated the amounts of refinery 
gas used for autoproducer electricity production. 
Consumption 
In  the  2021  edition,  consumption  of  motor  gasoline  for  road  transport  and  of 
gas/diesel  oil for  rail  transport  have  been  estimated  by  the IEA  Secretariat for 
2019 based on information provided by the EIA.  
In the 2021 edition, non-energy use of gas/diesel oil in the chemical (including 
petrochemical) sector has been estimated by the IEA Secretariat for 2019 based 
on information provided by the EIA. 
In the 2021 edition, consumption of petroleum coke in industry – not elsewhere 
specified  has  been  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  for  2019  based  on 
information  provided  by  the  EIAIn  2018  demand  for  petrochemical  feedstocks 
derived  from  oil  products  increased  following  new  ethylene  production  capacity 
coming online and the ramp up in polyethylene capacity. This trend is expected 
to continue through 2019 as further ethylene capacity comes online.  
Between 2010 and 2011, end-use energy consumption data for the United States 
present  a  break  in  time  series  due  to  a  change  in  methodology.  For  the  period 
2011-2016, quantities of non-energy use of LPG in chemical and petrochemical, 
and  of  other  oil  products  in  non-specified  industry  have  been  estimated  by  the 
IEA Secretariat.  
From  2013  onwards,  road  use  lubricants  are  reported  under  non  energy 
consumption  in  transport  equipment, machinery, and  wood  and  wood  products. 
Previously, such quantities were reported under non-specified industry. 
From 1995 onwards, LPG inputs to gas works are included in industry. 
Natural gas 
General notes 
Puerto  Rico  is  currently  not  included  in  US  data  for  natural  gas  with  the 
exception  of  gas  consumed  for  electricity  generation.  LNG  imports  into  Puerto 
Rico are reported in the Other non-OECD Americas regional aggregate.

Supply 
In  the  2017  edition  of  this  publication,  the  indigenous  production  data  for  2014 
was revised by the US administration creating a break in the time series between 
2013 and 2014 due to a change in the methodology. In addition, this increased 
the statistical difference that remained high in 2015 and 2016. 
The exports have been increasing since 2015, due to new liquefaction capacity 
(i.e. Sabine Pass) coming online at the end of that year. 
Transformation 
Since 2012, data reported under non-specified transformation represent natural 
gas used for hydrogen manufacture. Prior to 2012, these quantities are reported 
under the chemical and petrochemical sector. 
Between  1999  and  2000,  there  are  some  breaks  in  time  series  for  the 
transformation subsectors due to a new data reporting method. 
Between 1990 and 2002, the amounts of gas works gas that are blended with 
natural  gas  have  been  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  output  efficiency  of  the 
process. 
Since  1989,  consumption  by  autoproducer  CHP  plants  is  available,  while 
consumption  by  autoproducer  electricity  and  main  activity  producer  CHP  plants 
is  available  since  1991.  Prior  to  these  years,  these  consumptions  are  included 
with industry and commerce/public services. 
Consumption 
In  the  2019  edition,  revisions  were  made  to  the  industry  sector  from  2015 
onwards,  by  reallocating  natural  gas  consumption  to  the  chemical  and 
petrochemical sub-sector from other industrial sub-sectors. 
Due to revisions made to the iron and steel model, there is a break in the time 
series between 2014 and 2015 for the consumption in blast furnaces (energy). 
Until 2001, agriculture/forestry consumption is included under industry. 
From 1995 to 2001, the detailed breakdown of industry consumption is estimated 
by  the  Energy  Information  administration  using  the  Manufacturing  Energy 
Consumption Survey (MECS), which is conducted quadrennially.

Prior  to  1995  a  detailed  breakdown  of  industry  consumption  is  not  available 
(between  1990  and  1994,  chemical  consumption  is  estimated  by  the  American 
administration). 
In  1991  data  on  natural  gas  use  in  the  road  sector  were  collected  for  the  first 
time, and are not available for previous years. 
Non-specified  energy  industry  own  use  represents  natural  gas  consumed  for 
the production of ethanol.  
Consumption in fisheries is included under industry. 
Biofuels and waste 
General notes 
The EIA assumes all industrial waste is non-renewable. 
In  the  2022  edition,  bio  jet  kerosene  appears  for  the  first  time  for  the  year 
2021p. The values will be subject to revisions in future editions. 
Due to the change in reporting methodology for liquid biofuels, breaks in time 
series  occur  between  2009  and  2010.  This  is  especially  noticeable  in  the 
biodiesel time series.  
Supply 
Data  for  indigenous  production  and  domestic  supply  of  industrial  waste  have 
been estimated by the IEA Secretariat for 2019p. 
Data for production of industrial waste have been decreasing since May 2014 
due to reclassification, resulting in a break in series between 2013 and 2014. 
Indigenous  production  of  biodiesel  is  estimated  in  2010  based  on  the  EIA’s 
Monthly Energy Report. 
Transformation 
The EIA collects generation and consumption data from all plants 1 MW or more 
in capacity. 
Consumption 
Due  to  an  improved  estimation,  there  are  some  breaks  in  time  series  of  the 
industry  sector  and  other  sectors  between  2009  and  2010:  for  industry,

geothermal, biogases and industrial waste (paper, pulp and printing); for other 
sectors, geothermal and solar thermal. 
Electricity and heat 
General notes 
Geothermal supply and inputs to transformation data are estimated by the IEA 
Secretariat starting in 2009 because of efficiency discrepancies. 
Between  2001  and  2002,  there  are  breaks  in  time  series  concerning  the  total 
production  of  electricity  and  heat  in  the  United  States.  Comprehensive  data  on 
electricity  and  heat  production  and  consumption  in  main  activity  producer 
electricity, CHP and heat plants and autoproducer electricity and CHP plants are 
not available for all years. 
Supply 
There  is  a  break  in  series  for  geothermal  and  solar  thermal  direct  use  data 
between  2017  and  2018  as  a  new  methodology  for  reporting  these  data  was 
adopted with 2018 data. There is an additional break in series between 2018 and 
2019e  data for  geothermal  direct  use,  as  the methodology  has reverted  to  the 
previous one. 
The  IEA  Secretariat  estimated  US  solar  PV  electricity  generation  from 
autoproducers  starting  in  1999  by  multiplying  the  dispersed  and  distributed  PV 
capacity  estimated  by  the  US  administration  by  an  average  capacity  factor  of 
12%.  The  capacity  factor  was  based  on  a  report  published  in  2007  by  the  IEA 
Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme, Cost and Performance Trends in Grid-
Connected  Photovoltaic  Systems  and  Case  Studies.  The  corresponding 
consumption of electricity has been included under non-specified other. 
Data  for  electricity  inputs  to  and  outputs  from  pumped  storage  hydro  plants 
became available starting in 1987. 
Discrepancies  occur  between  respective  reported  figures  for  electricity  trade 
between  the  US  and  Mexico  from  2013  onwards,  and  between  the  US  and 
Canada from  2016  onwards. This  is  in  part  due  to  a change  in  data  source for 
US  electricity  trade  figures,  which  creates  a  break  in  series  between  2015  and 
2016.

Transformation 
Electricity  inputs  to  both  mixed  hydro  and  pure  pumped  storage  pumping 
plants are reported under inputs to pure pumped storage.  
Offshore wind production began in 2016. 
Beginning with 2016 data, the calculation for heat production in CHP plants has 
changed, resulting  in  breaks  in time  series. The  United  States  administration  is 
currently  unable  to  apply  this  methodology  to  historic  years,  so  will  only  cover 
heat  data  for  2016  onwards.  As  a  result  of  this  methodology  change,  several 
combustible  fuel  power  plants  have  their  overall  efficiency  values  increased, 
recording  increased  heat  production.  The  previous  methodology  existed  for  the 
years 2006 to 2015, so further breaks exist between 2005 and 2006. 
For  2016,  electricity  and  heat  generation  from  some  types  of  coal  and  some 
plant types were estimated by the IEA Secretariat, based on an initial submission 
from  the  US  administration  and  subsequent  reclassification  of  portions  of  this 
coal between coal types. 
Accurate  accounting  of  coke  oven  gas  and  refinery  gas  inputs  is  not  always 
possible,  which  can  lead  to  efficiencies  of  over  100%  in  main  activity  producer 
CHP plants. 
Other  sources  electricity  production  represents  purchased  steam  and  waste 
heat from industries. 
The  low  efficiencies  from  2011  for  other  bituminous  coal  autoproducer 
electricity  plants  are  due  to  the  fact  that  one  unit;  the  Albany  Brewery  Power 
Plant only produces unsold heat, and is reported in the wrong category of plant. 
From  2007  to  2009,  heat  from  industrial  waste  includes  recovered  heat  from 
industrial  processes.  From 2010, the electricity produced from recovered heat  is 
reported under other sources. 
The decline in patent fuel used for electricity production in 2008 and subsequent 
cessation  in  2009  is  a  result  of  the  termination  of  the  “synthetic  fuel  from  coal” 
tax credit in 2008, which had been in the order of $20 to $25 USD per tonne, and 
while  intended  to  deal  with  coal  liquefaction  and  similar  technologies,  it  had 
spawned an industry of cosmetic upgrading as a tax minimisation vehicle. 
From  2004  to  2013,  the  EIA  reported  electricity  and  heat  production  from 
anthracite under other bituminous coal. The Secretariat estimated the split of

generation  output  by  fuel  type  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  plant 
efficiencies of the aggregate are equal to that of each part. 
Starting in 2002, autoproducer electricity output for oil includes generation from 
refinery gases with a low average calorific value. Prior to 2002, this output was 
not accounted for. 
Prior to 2001, some data on plants consuming sub-bituminous coal and lignite 
have  been  estimated  by  the  Secretariat  using  information  provided  in  the  EIA’s 
Annual Electricity Generator Report – Utility. 
Data  for  peat  are  confidential  between  1994  and  1998  and  from  2000  are  not 
reported. 
Prior  to  2000,  autoproducers  include  small  and  independent  power  producers 
which  under  IEA  definitions  are  considered  as  main  activity  producers. 
Production  from  these  small  and  independent  power  producers  accounts  for 
about  25%  of  reported  production  of  electricity  by  autoproducers  in  the  United 
States. This reclassification causes breaks between 1999 and 2000.  
In the 2003 edition, the United States administration reclassified some plants to 
autoproducers.  This  reclassification  causes  more  breaks  between  1998  and 
1999. 
Data for heat produced in main activity producer heat plants are available from 
1992 to 1999, and for autoproducer CHP plants for 1989 to 1999. 
From  1999  onwards,  the  fuel  used  in  heat  production  by  autoproducers  is 
included in final consumption because the US administration cannot distinguish 
between  the  heat  used  directly  on-site  and  the  heat  sold.  Therefore,  this  may 
underestimate the heat sold to third parties. 
Prior  to  1999,  solar  thermal  electricity  production  includes  generation  from 
natural gas because some natural gas units are attached to solar thermal plants 
and their production could not be separated. 
Prior to 1991 some of the fuel inputs to electricity and heat production reported 
for  autoproducer  plants  are  reported  as  final  consumption  in  the  particular 
economic sector in which the autoproducer is operating. 
Prior to 1989, there are no generation data available from autoproducers. 
Sub-bituminous  coal  inputs  for  electricity  and  heat  production  are  included  in 
hard coal before 1983.

Consumption 
Consumption  breakdown  data  for  electricity  are  modelled  based  on  data 
obtained  from  the  Annual  Energy  Outlook  and  conversion  factors.  These  data 
are based on fiscal values rather than physical tonnage, so if commodity prices 
increase or decrease between AEO versions and the conversion factors are not 
updated, derived changes in consumption may appear that are not supported by 
physical changes in production, or actual changes in consumption. For example 
in  2016,  production  of  steel  in  electric  arc  furnaces  increased  by  6%,  however 
consumption of electricity in the iron and steel industry was reported as declining 
by 17%. In addition, as the AEO models are revised annually, but the historical 
data are not necessarily revised, regular breaks in-series can occur. 
For  the  2019  edition,  the  breakdown  of  final  electricity  consumption  for  2017 
was  based  on  the  results  of  the  Annual  Energy  Outlook  (AEO)  of  2018.  The 
model  used  in  the  2018  edition  of  the  Outlook  was  updated  to  incorporate  the 
results  of  the  2014  Manufacturing  Energy  Consumption  Survey  (MECS).  The 
MECS values were last updated in 2010, and in the intervening period, several 
industries  had  changed  significantly.  For 
industry  sub-sectors  where 
disaggregated AEO2018 values are unavailable e.g. non-ferrous metals, textiles, 
and non-metallic minerals, consumption was extrapolated from the MECS 2014 
values  at  the  same  rate  as  shipments  in  that  industry.  Breaks  in  time  series 
occur across several sectors between 2016 and 2017. 
Similarly, the breakdown of final electricity consumption for 2015 was based on 
the  results  of  the  Annual  Energy  Outlook  (AEO)  of  2016.  Breaks  in  time  series 
appear in the mining and agricultural electricity consumption sectors as a result 
of introduction of individual industry benchmarking for 2015 results. Changes in 
iron  and  steel,  and  pulp  and  paper  data  from  2014  to  2015  are  the  result  of 
fundamental revisions of the iron and steel and pulp and paper models between 
AEO2014 and AEO2016 as well as the use of individual industry benchmarking 
for  AEO2016.  These  changes  are  a  few  notable  examples  of  series  changes, 
and any series can change between AEO releases because of data updates and 
methodology changes. 
Electricity  consumption  in  road  includes  all  estimated  consumption  by  electric 
vehicles (both 100% and plug-in hybrids).  
Prior  to  1991,  total  consumption  of  heat  sold  referred  to  consumption  in 
commercial/public services.

No  data  are  available  for  heat  sold  that  is  consumed  in  the  residential  and 
agriculture/forestry sectors for any year. 
Data for direct use of solar thermal heat in residential are available from 1999. 
Since 1995, heat consumption data by sector are no longer collected, and have 
been  estimated  by  the  Secretariat,  resulting  in  breaks  in  time  series  between 
1994 and 1995, and 1999 and 2000. 
Data  for  consumption  of  heat  sold  in  industry  are  available  from  1991  and  in 
energy industry own use from 1992.

non-OECD Americas and Other non-OECD Asia. It was also used in a number of 
other countries as a complementary data source.  
is  a  4-year  (2019-2023)  EU-INTPA 
Energy  Sub-Saharan  Africa 
funded 
programme  aimed  to  create  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic  growth  in 
selected  sub-Saharan  African  countries  through  energy  sector  transitions 
towards  low-carbon  and  climate-resilient  energy  systems  based  in  renewable 
energy,  while  delivering  universal  and  affordable  energy  access.  This  will  be 
achieved  by  helping  the  selected  sub-Saharan  African  countries  to  develop 
enhanced energy statistics and energy modelling capabilities, to improve tracking 
against energy-related NDCs, SDGs, and other policy goals, as well as long-term 
energy  planning.  The  ten  countries  that  have  adhered  to  the  programme  are 
Benin,  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo,  Ethiopia,  Ghana,  Kenya,  Nigeria, 
Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda and Zambia.

Albania  
General notes 
Data for Albania are available starting in 1971.  
Before  1993,  large  quantities  of  oil,  widely  reported  to  have  moved  through 
Albania  into  Former  Yugoslavia,  are  not  included  in  oil  trade.  Although  they 
might have represented up to 100% of domestic consumption levels, no reliable 
figures for this trade are available.  
Starting  from  2011,  motor  gasoline  consumption  is  reported  in  the  residential 
sector.  This  consumption  corresponds  to  motor  gasoline  used  in  electricity 
generators.

Algeria 
General notes 
Data for Algeria are available starting in 1971.  
Crude  oil  production  and  export  data  do  not  include  field  condensate.  Field 
condensate quantities are included with natural gas liquids. 
In  the  2021  edition,  newly  available  information  lead  to  the  report  of  the  split 
between international marine bunkers and domestic navigation for the first time.  
In the 2021 edition, new use of official data on final consumption of natural gas 
led to revisions in the breakdown by detailed industries between 2014 and 2018. 
This may cause breaks in time series between 2013 and 2014. 
In 2018 Sonatrach, the national oil and gas company, acquired a refinery in Italy. 
Crude  oil  input  and  refined  oil  products  output,  such  as  gas  oil  and  gasoline, 
from  this  facility  may  be  included  in  Algeria’s  national  production  for  2018  and 
the first half of 2019. This activity stopped for the second semester of 2019.    
In  the  2015  edition,  revisions  were  made  to  the  energy  balances  in  2009  and 
2010  which  add  more  detail  for  certain  products  and  flows.  This  may  result  in 
breaks in time series between 2008 and 2009.

Angola 
General notes 
Data for Angola are available starting in 1971.  
Crude  oil  production  and  export  data  do  not  include  field  condensate.  Field 
condensate quantities are included with natural gas liquids. 
The  natural  gas  export  terminal  Soyo,  which  began  operations  in  2013  and 
halted  them  in  2014,  re-opened  in  2016.  Breaks  in  time  series  in  natural  gas 
export, supply, and consumption can be observed between 2013 and 2017. 
In  the  2022  edition,  2018  natural  gas  data  were  revised  based  on  revisions  to 
data provided by Cedigaz. 
In the  2021  edition,  natural gas  input to  main  activity  producer  electricity plants 
was added from 2017-2019 to account for the operations of the Soyo Combined 
Cycle  thermal  power  plant.  Consequently,  all  electricity  flows  have  also  been 
revised over this period.    
In  the  2021  edition,  several  data  points  were  revised  to  better  reflect  data 
published by Sonangol. They include: crude oil refinery input (2018), imports of 
LPG,  jet  kerosene,  other  kerosene,  motor  gasoline,  and  gas/diesel  oil  (2016-
2018),  exports  of  jet  kerosene  and  motor  gasoline  (2018),  and  jet  kerosene 
consumption (2018). Gas/diesel oil input to main activity electricity plants (2016-
2018) and fuel oil production and international marine bunkers (2018) were also 
affected by these revisions.  
In  the  2021  edition,  2018  hydroelectricity  production  was  revised  based  on 
revisions  to  data  provided  by  the  International  Renewable  Energy  Agency 
(IRENA). 
In the 2019 edition, revisions to biofuels and waste data are due to revisions in 
population data for Angola.

Argentina 
General notes 
Data for Argentina are available starting in 1971.  
In  the  2022  edition,  disaggregated  industrial  consumption  of  natural  gas  is 
estimated as data is not available.  
In  the  2021  edition,  new  use  of  customs  information  led  to  revisions  of  coal 
imports between 2002 and 2018.  
In  the  2020  edition,  Argentina’s  1971-2017  time  series  were  revised  across  all 
products  after  communication  of  revised  historical  balances  from  Secretaría  de 
Energía.  Most  of  the  revisions  are  based  on  those  revised  energy  balances; 
others are based on revisions from the IEA Secretariat after analysis of available 
historical balance series. In detail: 
Coke oven coke, coke oven gas and blast furnace gas data are estimated by the 
IEA Secretariat from 2006 onwards.  
Petroleum coke demand is estimated by the IEA Secretariat from 2006 onwards, 
and  trade  is  sourced  from  Instituto  Nacional  de  Estadística  y  Censos  de  la 
República from 2006 onwards.  
Data  on  electricity  demand  by  industrial  sub-sector  is  available  since  2015. 
However,  it  reflects  fixed  shares  of  demand  by  sub-sector  and  does  not  reflect 
variation of demand trends between sub-sectors over time. Electricity generation 
by fossil source is estimated by the IEA Secretariat based on information of fuel 
inputs and generation by technology.  
Biogas data includes biogases from thermal processes in the paper industry up 
to  2013,  and  electricity  generation  data  reported  by  CAMMESA  from  2012. 
Refinery feedstocks data is available from 1999.  
Additives data contains MTBE from 1994 and other octane improvers from 2010 
onwards. A structural break may exist between 2009 and 2010. Natural gas data 
contains trade of wet gas and own use of wet gas in oil and gas extraction. This 
can lead to statistical differences in the time series. 
The  Secretaría  de  Energía  is  developing  its  statistical  system  to  collect  further 
data on final consumption data and its disaggregation by activity. This could lead 
to data revisions or breaks in time series in future editions.

Since  2010  a  different  methodology  was  adopted  by  Argentina  for  reporting 
refinery flows leading to more detailed information (e.g. reprocessing of some oil 
products).  This  may  result  in  breaks  in  time  series  between  2009  and  2010. 
Breaks in time series may also exist between 1993 and 1994 due to the start of 
the data series coverage of such refinery flows.

Armenia 
General notes 
Data for Armenia are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included in 
Former Soviet Union.  
Armenia is one of the 11 EU4Energy focus countries. 
In  the  2021  edition,  nuclear  power  efficiency  data  from  2014  onwards  reported 
by  Armenia  were  used  to  calculate  primary  energy  equivalent  of  nuclear  power 
generation. In previous years, IEA standard efficiency was used. As a result, the 
time  series  of  nuclear  electricity  generation  in  energy  units  were  revised  from 
2014 to 2018. 
In the 2021 edition, natural gas consumption was reclassified from not elsewhere 
specified  (other)  to  agriculture/forestry  from  2017  onwards.  Prior  to  2017, 
consumption by not elsewhere specified (other) may include the consumption by 
agriculture/forestry.In  the  2020  edition,  the  National  Statistical  Service  of 
Armenia  changed  the  methodology  of  classification  of  final  sectors  for  natural 
gas. This might lead to breaks in time series for 2017-2018. 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  National  Statistical  Service  of  Armenia  changed  the 
methodology for electricity breakdown by consuming sectors. This might lead to 
breaks in time series for 2017-2018. 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  National  Statistical  Service  of  Armenia  revised  primary 
solid biofuels data from 2015 onwards. This might lead to breaks in time series 
between 2014 and 2015. 
 From  the  2017  edition  onwards,  more  accurate  data  on  electricity  and  CHP 
plants became available. This might lead to breaks in time series for 2014-2015. 
 From  the  2017  edition,  survey  data  on  the  consumption  of  energy  products  in 
Armenia became available. Partial data were already available for 2014 for some 
products  as  Armenia  ran  a  pilot  survey.  Prior  to  2014,  consumption  data  were 
not available and have been estimated by the IEA Secretariat based on supply. 
Therefore, breaks in time series occur between 2013 and 2014, as well as 2014 
and 2015; 2015 should be used as reference year.

Azerbaijan 
General notes 
Data for Azerbaijan are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included 
in Former Soviet Union. 
Azerbaijan is one of the 11 EU4Energy focus countries. 
Field condensates from Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz field are reported together with 
NGLs. 
Azerbaijan  natural  gas  data  are  reported  at  temperature  and  pressure  of  20°C 
and 101.325 kPa, respectively. 
Natural gas production data may differ from Azerbaijan national energy balance. 
Natural gas produced and used in the oil and gas extraction industry is counted 
by the IEA Secretariat in natural gas production.   
In  the  2021  edition,  net  calorific  values  (NCVs)  reported  by  Azerbaijan  for  oil 
were  used  to  convert  physical  data  to  energy  units.  In  previous  years,  IEA 
standard NCVs were used. As a result, the time series of primary and secondary 
oil products were revised for varying periods between 1990 and 2018. 
Breaks in time series appear for inputs and outputs of electricity, CHP and heat 
plants in Azerbaijan between 2006 and 2007 due to an improved data collection 
methodology in the country from 2007 onwards. 
For  the  purpose  of  calculating  CO2  emissions,  an  allocation  between  domestic 
and international aviation consumption of jet kerosene was estimated by the IEA 
Secretariat  for  1990-2006  based  on  total  aviation  consumption  reported  by 
Azerbaijan and the 2007 allocation.  
A  break  in  time  series  may  be  observed  between  2015  and  2016  consumption 
data due to a household consumption survey.

Bahrain  
General notes 
Data for Bahrain are available starting in 1971.  
Crude oil production includes half the production from the Abu Sa’fah field, which 
is shared with Saudi Arabia. 
Consumption  of  natural  gas  for  autoproducer  power  generation  may  include 
quantities used for non-power generation purposes. 
In the 2021 edition, crude oil imports and exports data from 2001 onwards were 
revised  as  new  information  became  available  from  National  Oil  and  Gas 
Authority  of  Bahrain  (NOGA).  This  may  create  a  break  in  time  series  between 
2000 and 2001. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  following  products  and  flows  were  revised  as  new 
information  became  available  from  National  Oil  and  Gas  Authority  of  Bahrain 
(NOGA): natural gas industrial consumption data from 2012 onwards; gas/diesel 
oil  international  marine  bunker  consumption  from  2010  onwards;  fuel  oil 
international  marine  bunker  consumption  from  1971  onwards;  residential  and 
commercial  and  public  services  consumption  of  other  kerosene  from  2017 
onwards;  production  of  jet kerosene from  2017 onwards;  and  imports  and  non-
energy use consumption of bitumen from 2014 onwards. 
In the 2021 edition, stock changes for fuel oil were revised based on JODI data 
from 2005 onwards.  
In  the  2021  edition,  conversion  factors  (barrels/tonne)  for  all  oil  products  were 
revised as new information was provided by NOGA. This led to the revision of oil 
products data for the entire time series. 
In  the  2020  edition,  stock  changes  for  LPG,  motor  gasoline  and  kerosene  type 
jet fuel  were revised  based  on  JODI  data from  2009  onwards.  New  information 
from Bahrain Open Data Portal led to the revision of exports of fuel oil from 2006 
to 2015. Natural gas stock changes from 2005 onwards were revised due to the 
clarification  on 
the  definition  of  published  data  by  Central 
Informatics 
Organization. 
In  the  2019  edition,  historical  revisions  in  bitumen  transfer  data  from  1988 
onwards have been made.

In  the  2017  edition,  historical  revisions  in  LPG,  naphtha  and  refinery  gas  data 
from  2011  are  consistent  with  official  report  from  Bahrain  National  Gas 
Company. Breaks in time series are observed in 2011 for LPG exports.  
In the 2014 edition, estimations of the use of petroleum coke in the manufacture 
of  aluminium  have  been  made  to  track  this  consumption  from  2000  onwards. 
This may lead to breaks in time series between 1999 and 2000.

Bangladesh  
General notes 
Data for Bangladesh are available starting in 1971.  
Data  are  reported  on  a  fiscal  year  basis.  Data  for  2020  correspond  to  1 July 
2019 – 30 June 2020. 
Official  data  on  electricity  production  provide  net  generation.  The  own  use  is 
estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  at  6%  of  the  net  electricity  generation  from 
2008 onwards. 
From  2000  onwards,  due  to  the  lack  of  official  information,  by  convention,  the 
fuelwood  domestic  usage  is  equally  split  between  transformation  and  final 
consumption. 
In  the  2021  edition,  electricity  final  consumption  data  were  revised  as  new 
information from Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics became available. 
In  the  2021  edition,  production  and  residential  consumption  of  primary  solid 
biofuels  including  fuelwood,  bagasse,  vegetal  materials  and  residues,  animal 
waste and charcoal were revised from 2000 onwards using data from the World 
Health Organisation on reliance on biomass for cooking. 
In the 2020 edition, times series for electricity imports were revised from 2014 to 
2017  based  on  new  data  retrieved  from  the  Bangladesh  Power  Development 
Board. Breaks in time series may occur between 2013 and 2014. 
In  the  2014  edition,  petroleum  products  time  series  were  revised  from  2004  to 
2012 based on new data retrieved from the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation 
and  the  Eastern  Refinery  Limited.  This  may  result  in  breaks  in  time  series 
between 2004 and 2005 for primary and secondary oil products. 
In the 2013 edition, electricity time series were revised from 2008 to 2011 based 
on  data  retrieved  from  the  Bangladesh  Power  Development  Board.  This  may 
result in breaks in time series between 2007 and 2008.

Belarus 
General notes 
Data for Belarus are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included in 
Former Soviet Union.  
Belarus is one of the 11 EU4Energy focus countries.  
Belarus natural gas data are reported at temperature and pressure of 20°C and 
101.325 kPa, respectively. 
Belarus exports of other bituminous coal include re-export volumes. 
In  the  2022  edition,  there  are  breaks  in  the  time  series  of  biogases  between 
2019  and  2020 for  indigenous  production, main activity  producer electricity  and 
commercial and public services, due to new administrative data from the Ministry 
of Energy. 
In the 2022 edition, trade, stock change and final consumption of charcoal were 
revised from 2008 onwards based on new available information. 
In  the  2021  edition,  for  crude  oil,  jet  fuel  kerosene  and  other  kerosene  the  IEA 
secretariat substituted the standard net calorific values (NCVs) used in previous 
years  with  the  ones  reported  by  Belarus.  As  a  result,  the  time  series  in  energy 
units of these products were slightly revised between 1991 and 2018. 
In  the  2021  edition,  some  quantities  of  peat  products  were  reclassified  from 
autoproducer to main activity producer heat plants in the period 1996-2011 due 
to newly available information.   
In  the  2020  edition,  the  whole  time  series  for  natural  gas  liquids  (NGL)  was 
revised  to  include  the  volumes  of  gas  obtained  in  the  process  of  oil 
stabilization. 
In  the  2020  edition,  wood  waste  from  furniture  was  reallocated  to  industrial 
waste in primary solid biofuels from 2016 onwards. This may lead to breaks in 
the industrial waste time series between 2015 and 2016. 
In the 2019 edition, coke oven coke use between 1998 and 2017 was revised 
as  non-energy  use  was  formerly  reported  in  the  food,  beverage  and  tobacco 
sector.

In  the  2018  edition,  several  producers’  electricity  plants  were  reclassified 
according  to the transition  to a  new  classifier  of  economic  activities. This  might 
lead 
to  breaks 
in 
time  series  of  autoproducers’  electricity  plant  and 
autoproducers’ CHP plant between 2016 and 2017.  
In the 2016 edition, methane produced as a by-product during the petrochemical 
transformation of naphtha was re-classified by Belarus for the period 1998-2011 
from  industrial  waste  to  refinery  gas.  This  may  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series 
between 1997 and 1998. 
Imports of refinery feedstocks were recorded for the first time in 2015.  
Jet kerosene was reported under “other products” until 2012.  
Breaks in time series appear in gas/diesel and fuel oil between 2011 and 2012 
as a result of a new classification of industrial products (heating oil re-classified 
under high sulphur fuel oil). 
Oil trade in 2010 shows a significant drop due to higher customs fee of imported 
quantities of crude oil from Russian Federation. 
Since  January  2010,  Belarus  became  a  member  of  a  Customs  Union  with 
Russia  and  Kazakhstan.  Breaks  in  trade  time  series  and  statistical  differences 
appear  from  2009  to  2011  as  the  Customs  progressively  shifted  from  one 
accounting system to another. Belarus reports all inputs and outputs to CHP and 
heat autoproducer plants including those corresponding to own use of heat.

Benin 
General notes 
Data for Benin are available starting in 1971.  
Benin  is  one  of  the  ten  countries  that  benefit  from  EU  Support  to  IEA  Data  for 
Affordable and Sustainable Energy System for Sub-Saharan Africa. 
In the 2020 edition, times series were revised from 2011 to 2014 based on new 
data  received  from  the  Ministry  of  Energy,  Water,  and  Mines.  Breaks  in  time 
series may occur between 2010 and 2011. 
In the 2019 edition, times series were revised from 2015 to 2017 based on new 
data  received  from  the  Ministry  of  Energy,  Water,  and  Mines.  Breaks  in  time 
series may occur between 2014 and 2015.

Bolivia 
General notes 
Data for Bolivia are available starting in 1971.  
Blending of ethanol in gasoline started in 2018. Additives are also imported, with 
imported quantities included in gasoline data. 
Data  on  distribution  losses  of  crude  oil  and  oil  products  includes  unexpected 
positive or negative quantity variations in refineries, pipelines and tanks that are 
not captured by the oil industry storage system measured in stock changes. 
National  authorities  currently  publish  charcoal,  fuel  wood  and  bagasse  data 
combined  in  a  single  aggregate,  using  projections  given  the  lack  of  detailed 
information.  This  data  can  be  revised  in  the  future  as  the  national  authorities 
develop their statistical system further. 
The efficiency of natural gas based electricity generation has been continuously 
increasing since 2011, in turn decreasing the gas grid emission factor. According 
to  information  provided  by  Ministerio  de  Hidrocarburos,  this  is  due  to  major 
actions that are being deployed in Bolivia in order to upgrade existing natural gas 
power plants to combined cycle. 
In the 2022 edition, new information provided by Ministerio de Hidrocarburos led 
to important revisions in NGL, White Spirit, Fuel Oil and Other Non-Specified Oil 
products between 2006 and 2020. The IEA Secretariat now considers Gasolina 
Blanca  Estabilizada  and  Gasolina  Rica  en  Isopentanos  as  NGL,  and  these 
products are reported as refinery intake. Crudo Reconstituido, a residual refinery 
output,  is  now  reported  in  Other  Non-Specified  Oil  Products.  Gasolina  Blanca 
(Refinery White Spirit) volumes do not appear in IEA Secretariat data as they are 
already reported in Motor Gasoline. Finally, the only transfer currently reported is 
from NGL to LPG.  
In  the  2022  edition,  new  information  from  Ministerio  de  Hidrocarburos  led  to 
revisions between 2000 and 2019. This may lead to breaks in time series of oil, 
natural gas and electricity between 1999 and 2000. 
In  the  2022  edition,  new  information  on  the  split  of  natural  gas  input  to  main 
activity and to autoproducer electricity plants became available since year 2000, 
leading to revisions between 2000 and 2019.

World energy balances 2022 Edition 
 
In  the  2022  edition,  new  information  became  available  for  Refinery  gas 
production,  own  use  in  oil  refineries  and  losses,  leading  to  revisions  between 
2000 and 2019. More detailed data in energy balances provided by Ministerio de 
Hidrocarburos  led  to  revisions  in  jet  kerosene  consumption  split  between 
international and domestic aviation. 
In the 2022 edition, revisions to bagasse consumption in the Industry sector from 
Ministerio  de  Hidrocarburos  led  to  revised  IEA  estimations  for  bagasse 
production in 2000-2019 time series. 
In  the  2021  edition,  revisions  to  conversion  factors  of  motor  gasoline  led  to 
revised total final consumption data between 2006 and 2018. Solid biofuels data 
was  also  revised  between  2014  and  2018.  Communication  with  Ministerio  de 
Hidrocarburos  also  led  to  revisions  to  liquid  biofuels  data,  with  ethanol  data 
available  from  2018  onwards.  Refinery  gas  data  is  estimated  by  the  IEA 
secretariat  from  2011  onwards,  due  to  lack  of  national  statistics  available  on 
refinery production and use of such gases. 
In  the  2020  edition,  new  information  from  Ministerio  de  Hidrocarburos,  Instituto 
Nacional  de  Estadistica  and  Autoridad  de  Fiscalizacion  y  Control  Social  de 
Electricidad led to revisions between 2006 and 2017. This may lead to breaks in 
time series of oil, natural gas and electricity between 2005 and 2006.  
In the 2020 edition, anthracite imports data also became available since 2000. 
In the 2020 edition, time series for solid biofuels were revised from 2000 to 2017 
due  to  new  information  from  Ministerio  de  Hidrocarburos,  Autoridad  de 
Fiscalizacion  y  Control  Social  de  Electricidad  and  Food  and  Agriculture 
Organisation (FAO). Data is partially estimated by the IEA Secretariat. This may 
lead to breaks in the series between 1999 and 2000. 
In  the  2020  edition,  new  information  on  the  split  between  independent  power 
producers and autoproducers became available since 2015, leading to revisions 
to autoproducer electricity generation and inputs to power generation. 
Data for international aviation bunkers are estimated by the IEA Secretariat. New 
information available in 2019 led to revisions of the data for 2005-2017 that may 
lead to breaks in time series between 2004 and 2005.

Bosnia and Herzegovina 
General notes 
Data  for  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  are  available  starting  in  1990.  Prior  to  that, 
they are included in Former Yugoslavia. 
In  the  2022  edition,  disaggregated  coal  data  became  available  between 
anthracite, other bituminous coal and coking coal. This also includes break down 
information on consumption flow data such as energy industry own use of blast 
furnace gas. This led to a break in the time series between 2019 and 2020.  
In the 2022 edition, there was a break in the time series between 2019 and 2020 
data for the input of combustible sources and its electricity and heat production 
from autoproducers. This was a result of an error in recognition of autoproducer 
from  industry  in  the  chemical  and  petrochemical  sector  that  was  corrected  in 
C2022  for  2020  with  the  plan  for  analysis  and  correction/revision  of  historical 
data. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  net  calorific  values  (NCVs)  of  crude  oil  reported  by 
Bosnia and Herzegovina were used to convert physical data to energy units. In 
previous editions, IEA standard NCVs were used. As a result, the time series of 
crude oil in energy units was revised from 2014 onwards. 
In the 2021 edition, crude oil and oil products data are affected by the overhaul 
works in the refinery of Brod. This might result in breaks in time series between 
2018 and 2019. 
In the 2020 edition, solid biofuels modelling by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Relations led to new data starting in 2018. A break in time series may 
occur  between  2017  and  2018.  Revisions 
for  historical  data  may  be 
communicated in the future. 
In  the  2019  edition,  data  on  electricity,  CHP  and  heat  were  submitted  by  the 
Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
In  the  2018  edition,  data  on  blast  furnace  gas  and  coke  oven  gas  production 
became  available  for  2016.  Also,  the  calorific  values  of  coking  coal  and  coke 
oven coke were revised for 2014-2016. This may result in breaks in time series 
on the efficiencies of blast furnaces and coke ovens between 2013 and 2014.

In  2018,  BHAS  received  technical  expertise  from  the  IEA  Secretariat  and 
reallocated  inputs  of  sub-bituminous  coal  to  electricity,  CHP  and  heat  plants  to 
lignite for the period 2014-2016. This may lead to breaks in time series between 
2013 and 2014. 
In 2015, BHAS conducted their first household survey on biomass consumption. 
Due to this newly available data, breaks in time series may occur between 2013 
and 2014. In order to further improve the biomass data quality, they revised data 
for the period 2014-2016. 
In 2014, BHAS conducted their first survey on oil product consumption. Breaks in 
time series may occur between 2012 and 2013. 
Until  2012,  the  source  for  crude  oil  and  secondary  oil  products  data  is  the 
publication “Industrial Production Bosnia and Herzegovina 2012” and “Oil Trade 
Data” both produced by the Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Energy  statistics  are  available  from  the  Agency  for  Statistics  of  Bosnia  and 
Herzegovina  (BHAS)  from  2008  for  electricity  and  heat  and  from  2009  for  coal 
and  natural  gas.  As  a  consequence,  breaks  in  time  series  may  occur  between 
2007 and 2008 for electricity and heat and 2008 and 2009 for other products.

Botswana  
General note 
Data for Botswana are available starting in 1971.  
In  the  2022  edition,  2018  and  2019  aviation  gasoline  and  non-bio  jet  kerosene 
flows  were  revised  based  on  data  provided  by  the  Botswana  Department  of 
Energy,  Ministry  of  Minerals,  Energy  and Water Resources.  Furthermore,  other 
bituminous coal exports (2017-2019) and production (2018) were revised to align 
with data published by Statistics Botswana.  
In the 2021 edition, motor gasoline imports and road consumption were revised 
from  1971-1980  to  reflect  trends  in  vehicle  registrations  published  by  Statistics 
Botswana. 
In  the  2021  edition,  data  were  added  for  gas/diesel  oil  and  fuel  oil  electricity 
output  from  main  activity  electricity  plants  for  the  years  1971-1980.  This  data 
were previously classified as electricity output from main activity electricity plants 
for  other  non-specified  oil  products.  Based  on  this  re-classification,  revisions 
were  also  made  to  gas/diesel  oil  and  fuel  oil  input  to  main  activity  electricity 
plants and imports over the same time period.  
In the 2021 edition, 2018 imports and road consumption of motor gasoline, 2018 
imports  and  residential  consumption  of  kerosene,  2018  imports  and  2009-2018 
consumption  of  gas/diesel  oil,  and  2018  production  of  other  bituminous  coal 
were revised to align with data provided by the Botswana Department of Energy, 
Ministry of Minerals, Energy and Water Resources. 
In  the  2021  edition,  revisions  were  also  made  to  other  bituminous  coal  exports 
(2017-2018) and 2012 transformation in main activity electricity plants using data 
provided  by  the  United  Nations  Statistical  Division.  Furthermore,  the  2018 
electricity output from other bituminous coal was revised to reflect data available 
from the Botswana Power Corporation. 
In  the  2021  edition,  solar  thermal  production  and  non-specified  consumption 
data  were  added  for  the  years  2015-2018  to  reflect  newly  accessed  data  from 
AEE – Institute for Sustainable Technologies.  
Also in the 2021 edition, data provided by the United Nations Statistical Division 
were  added  for  charcoal  production  and  consumption  for  the  years  1990-2018. 
New  flows  include  charcoal  production,  residential  consumption,  and  fuelwood

transformation in charcoal production plants. Consequently, fuelwood production 
was  also  revised  from  2004-2018  to  incorporate  this  new  data.  Fuelwood 
residential  consumption  from  2006-2018  was  also  revised  to  reflect  trends  in 
rural population growth published by the World Bank.    
In  the  2020  edition,  data  for  Botswana  became  available  for  the  years  1971-
1980,  allowing  the IEA Secretariat  to remove  Botswana  entirely  from the  Other

Brazil  
General notes 
Data for Brazil are available starting in 1971.  
Brazil joined the IEA as an Association country in October 2017. 
Although  IEA’s  balance  is  based  on  Brazil’s  national  statistics,  differences  with 
the national energy balance can be observed due to the different methodologies 
adopted for reporting nuclear, chemical heat, natural gas, NGL production, non-
energy use and production process of liquid biofuels, renewables, blast furnaces 
and coke ovens.  
Crude oil data includes small amounts of oil shale. 
The split between domestic and international marine bunkers is done based on 
flag (nationality) of ships.  
In  the  IEA  balance  for  Brazil,  “Biogasoline”  refers  to  anhydrous  ethanol  while 
“Other liquid biofuels” refers to hydrated ethanol. The national energy balance of 
Brazil  shows  bioethanol  as  two  separate  products:  anhydrous  ethanol  ("álcool 
anidro", i.e. nearly pure ethanol, containing less than 1% of water) and hydrated 
ethanol (“álcool hidratado”, i.e. a blend of ethanol and water, in the proportion of 
about  95%  to  5%,  generally  obtained  from  conventional  distillation).  While 
anhydrous  ethanol  is  blended  with  gasoline  (the  blend  sold  at  the  pump 
generally  contains  20-25%  of  ethanol),  hydrated  ethanol  is  sold  at  separate 
pumps as a product by itself (álcool) to be used in flex fuel cars, i.e. vehicles that 
can run on any mix of gasoline and ethanol.  
Allocation  of  consumption  to  subsectors  in  national  energy  statistics  is  done 
according  to  the  National  Classification  of  Economic  Activities  (CNAE).  Energy 
consumption  in  the  tobacco,  construction,  transport  machinery  and  machinery 
sectors is included in “other industries” in national data, which is allocated in the 
IEA  Balance  to  non-specified  industry.  As  such,  consumption  in  the  food  and 
tobacco sector excludes the tobacco sector. 
In the 2022 edition, close cooperation with the Ministry of Mines and Energy led 
to  a  revision  in  biogasoline  and  other  liquid  biofuels  losses.  These  are  now 
exceptionally  taken  into  account  with  the  objective  of  reducing  statistical 
difference.  The  key  changes  are  that  they  now    include  losses  in  evaporation,

leaks,  accidents  during  the  process  of  production  and  storage  in  addition  to 
distribution losses. 
In the 2021 edition, close cooperation with the Ministry of Mines and Energy also 
led to a series of revisions affecting oil and gas data, enhancing harmonization of 
IEA  data  with  national  energy  balances.  The  quantities  of  refinery  input  and 
output  now  reflect  those  reported  by  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Energy  more 
accurately. Wet gas losses in gas separation plants are now excluded from NGL 
production,  leading  to  revisions  from  2011.  Production  of  LPG  and  motor 
gasoline  was  also  revised  to  exclude  the  quantities  resulting  from  naphtha 
processing  by  the  petrochemical  industry,  which  are  now  included  in  transfers. 
The  calorific  values  of  natural  gas,  other  non-specified  oil  products  and  natural 
gas liquids have also been revised. As a result of these changes, production and 
transfers have been revised for LPG,motor gasoline and other non-specified oil 
products  since  1971.  Refinery  feedstocks  have  also  been  revised  from  1971, 
with significantly lower levels of refinery input. 
The  national  energy  balance  of  Brazil  reports  quantities  of  “Other  non-
renewable” energy consumed by the chemical, cement, iron and steel, and other 
sectors  for  both  final  consumption  and  autoproducer  CHP  generation.  This 
combines  a  series  of  energy  sources,  such  as  tyre  scrape,  clay,  blast  furnace 
dust, tail gas, residual gases, sulphur gases and other residues. Starting with the 
2021  edition,  these  products  and  their  corresponding  electricity  generation  are 
allocated to industrial waste, except for the power inputs of the chemical sector, 
which  are  allocated  to  heat  from  chemical  sources.  This  leads  to  a  structural 
break in 2017, as generation from such energy sources in the iron and steel was 
not separated from blast furnace gases before 2017. 
In the 2021 edition, biogases from thermal processes include the amount of blast 
furnace  gases  from  charcoal,  and  the  corresponding  electricity  generated  from 
those gases, from 2012 onwards. 
In  the  2020  edition,  new  information  became  available,  leading  to  revisions  to 
2016,  2017  and  2018  data  in  coal,  gas  oil  and  electricity.  Data  on  biogas  in 
transformation  processes  has  been  revised  since  2008,  oil  product  densities 
since  2014,  and  biodiesel  and  diesel  data  since  2011. Transfers  of fuel  oil  and 
lubricants have been revised since 2012. 
In the 2015 edition, new information became available which explains the types 
of product transfers within Brazilian refineries. The IEA attempted to reflect these 
transfers as accurately as possible.

Brazil produces a large share of its pig iron in blast furnaces that are fuelled and 
fed with charcoal. The blast furnace gases produced when charcoal is used as a 
reagent  in  the  blast  furnaces  are  renewable  products  and  they  have  been 
reported 
in 
this  publication  under 
the  product  “Biogases 
from 
thermal 
processes”.  Add-itionally,  only  the  part  of  these  gases  consumed  for  power 
generation (i.e. energy purposes) has been ac-counted for in the transformation 
sector. The remaining charcoal consumed in or used to heat the blast furnaces is 
reported in final consumption under the iron and steel industry with no distinction 
between transformation and final consumption. 
Prior to the year 2000 blast furnace gases data availability is limited to the input 
to auto producer electricity plants. Therefore, from 1971 to 1999, the other flows 
(e.g. production, consumption etc.) are IEA Secretariat estimates. 
The Itaipu  hydroelectric plant,  operating  since  1984  and  located  on the Paraná 
River  (which  forms  the  border  of  Brazil  and  Paraguay)  was  formed  as  a  joint 
venture  between  Eletrobrás  and  the  Paraguayan  government.  Production  is 
shared equally between Brazil and Paraguay.

Brunei Darussalam  
General notes 
Data for Brunei Darussalam are available starting in 1971.  
In  2019,  a  new  refinery  and  petrochemical  complex  located  at  Pulau  Muara 
Besar  started  operations.  A  new  plant  began  producing  electricity  to  supply  it. 
This is reflected in the 2021 edition oil data as well as imports and use of lignite. 
In  the  2018  edition,  Brunei  Darussalam  2015  and  2016  energy  balances  were 
established  by  the  IEA Secretariat  based  on  official  energy  balances  submitted 
by Ministry of Energy, Manpower and Industry.  
In  the  2009  edition,  new  information  became  available  on  the  split  in 
consumption  of  refinery  gas.  This  may  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series  between 
2008 and 2009. 
In  the  2008  edition,  Brunei  Darussalam  confirmed  that  they  stopped  using  fuel 
wood in 1992.

Bulgaria 
General notes 
Data for Bulgaria are available starting in 1971.  
In the 2022 edition, useful heat produced by nuclear plants was reclassified from 
CHP to heat only. Therefore, all nuclear main activity producer CHP plant input 
and output has been moved to nuclear main activity producer heat plants for the 
entire time series (1994-2019).  
In the 2021 edition, the status of Bulgaria’s crude oil indigenous production data 
was changed to confidential. A break in the time series may occur between 2018 
and 2019.  
In the 2021 edition, net calorific values (NCVs) reported by Bulgaria were used 
to convert physical data to energy units. In previous years, IEA standard NCVs 
were  used.  As  a  result,  the  time  series  of  primary  and  secondary  oil  products 
were revised for varying periods between 1991 and 2018. Coal NCVs were also 
revised from 2015 to 2018. Breaks in the time series may occur. 
Data  on  the  use  of refused  derived fuel  (RDF)  are  included  in  Bulgaria’s waste 
statistics  since  the  2020  edition.  Thereby,  the  renewable  part  of  this  fuel  is 
allocated  to  renewable  municipal  waste,  while  the  non-renewable  part  is 
allocated  to  industrial  waste.  In  the  2021  edition,  more  information  on  these 
renewable  waste  components  became  available  from  2018,  resulting  in  the 
reclassification  of  some  non-renewable  industrial  waste.  As  the  combustion  of 
waste for power generation in Bulgaria is experimental, breaks in the time series 
may  occur.  The  National  Statistical  Institute  is  currently  reviewing  their 
methodology for this reporting.  
Non-specified  transformation  of  natural  gas  to  other  hydrocarbons  corresponds 
to hydrogen used in refineries. 
Bulgaria has re-classified black liquor from industrial waste to solid biofuels and 
the  renewable  portion  of  tyres  from  industrial  waste  (non-renewable)  to  solid 
biofuels (industrial waste – renewable part) from 2008. Breaks in time series may 
occur between 2007 and 2008.  
A  break  in  the  time  series  for  natural  gas  stock  changes  may  occur  between 
2003 and 2004 as cushion gas is excluded from 2004 onwards.

Cambodia 
General notes 
Data for Cambodia are available starting in 1995. Prior to that, they are included 
in Other Asia. 
In the 2022 edtion, 2018-2020 official energy balances from the Energy Statistics 
Office of the Ministry of Mines and Energy became available. This led to a series 
of revisions and breaks in time series between 2017 and 2018. 
In  the  2021  edition,  2019  official  energy  balances  from  the  Energy  Statistics 
Office  of  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Energy  were  not  available  in  time  for 
publication.  Most flows  were  therefore  estimated  by  the IEA  Secretariat.  For  oil 
products, imports and final use data are based, where relevant, on International 
Trade Centre data, or on GDP and population developments. 
In the 2021 edition, total electricity, hydroelectricity, motor gasoline, jet kerosene, 
gas/diesel  oil,  LPG,  fuel  oil  and  sub-bituminous  coal  data  for  production,  trade, 
as well as use in the different economy sectors were revised from 2010 onwards 
as  new  information  became  available  from  Economic  Research  Institute  for 
ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA). This leads to breaks in time series between 2009 
and 2010.  
In  the  2021  edition,  residential  consumption  of  fuelwood  and  charcoal  were  re-
estimated from 1995 onwards using data from the World Health Organisation on 
reliance on biomass for cooking. 
In  the  2020  edition,  due  to  lack  of  official  country  data,  the  trade  and  final 
consumption  of  oil  products  and  coal  have  been  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat. 
In  the  2019  edition,  information  on  stock  changes  for  coal  and  some  petroleum 
products became available. This may lead to breaks in time series between 2016 
and 2017. 
In  the  2018  edition,  information  on  the  split  of  consumption  for  some  petroleum 
products  became  available  starting  from  2016.  This  may  lead  in  breaks  in  time 
series between 2015 and 2016. 
In the 2015 edition, new information regarding the imports of petroleum products 
in Cambodia from 2007 onwards became available. Data for these products were

Cameroon  
General notes 
Data for Cameroon are available starting in 1971.  
In  May  2019,  a  fire  occurred  at  Cameroon’s  only  oil  refinery,  shutting  down 
processing  operations.  As  2019  data  for  oil  products  were  not  available  at  the 
time of publication, the impact of this event was estimated in the 2021 edition. It 
was  assumed  that  refinery  inputs  and  outputs  would  decrease  proportionally, 
and that deficits in supply would be filled by imports.  
At  the  time  of  publication  of  the  2022  edition,  no  official  energy  data  were 
available for Cameroon for 2020 with the exception of primary oil and gas. Data 
for 2020 were therefore estimated by the IEA secretariat for all other products. 
In  the  2021  edition,  NGL  production  and  transfer  to  LPG  were  added  for  2018 
and 2019. This new data corresponds to new extraction of LPG from the Sanaga 
South gas fields. 
In the 2021 edition, newly available data from the Cameroon National Institute of 
Statistics  resulted  in  the  revision  of  crude  oil  imports  (2012-2014,  2016-2018), 
exports  (2016-2018),  and  refinery  input  (2012-2014),  LPG  production  (2011-
2014),  imports  (2016-2018),  and  consumption  flows  (2014,  2016-2018),  motor 
gasoline  production  (2011-2014),  imports  (2017-2018),  and  road  transport 
(2011-2014,  2016-2018),  and  electricity  losses  (2016-2018).  Production  of  non-
bio jet kerosene, refinery gas, gas/diesel oil, and non-specified oil products was 
also  revised  for  2012-2014  based  on  these  changes.  Breaks  in  the  time  series 
may occur. 
Also  in  the  2021  edition,  natural  gas  production  for  2016-2018  was  revised  to 
better  reflect  data  provided  by  Cedigaz.  Consequently,  natural  gas  input  to 
autoproducer  electricity  plants,  electricity  output,  and  electricity  consumption 
flows were revised slightly over the same period. Furthermore, bitumen imports 
and  consumption for  2012-2018  were  revised  based  on  trends  observed  in  UN 
Comtrade  data.  Finally,  electricity  output  from  hydro  in  2016  was  revised  to 
match data published by Eneo. Breaks in the time series may occur. 
Fuelwood  production,  transformation  in  charcoal  plants,  and  consumption  data 
from 2011 to 2014 were re-estimated in the 2021 edition in order to improve the 
quality  of  the  time  series  for  this  product.  Furthermore,  data  for  bagasse

production  and  industrial  consumption  were  added  for  1997-2018  based  on 
newly accessed data from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). 
For the 2020 edition, 2016, 2017 and 2018 data were not available by the time 
this publication was prepared. Data for those years were therefore estimated by 
the IEA secretariat.  
In  2018,  Cameroon  started  to  export  LNG.  The  IEA  Secretariat  sources  LNG 
data from Cedigaz publication. Breaks in time series might occur between 2017 
and 2018.  
In the 2019 edition, OAG data was used to estimate the share of domestic and 
international bunkering for aviation fuel between 2005 and 2017. Breaks in time 
series  might  occur  between  2004  and  2005.  Additionally,  solar  photovoltaic 
electricity generation was estimated based on IRENA data. 
In  the  2015  edition,  new  information  regarding  Cameroon  became  available. 
Data points were revised accordingly, which may lead to breaks in times series 
between  2011  and  2012  for  electricity  own  use  and  losses  and  between  2011 
and 2011 for crude oil trade and production.

World energy balances 2022 Edition 
 
People’s Republic of China 
General notes 
Data for the People’s Republic of China (China) are available starting in 1971.  
China joined the IEA as an Association country in November 2015. 
In  the  2021  edition,  following  results  from  the  economic  census,  NBS  supplied 
the  IEA  with  revisions  to  their  2014  –  2017  energy  data,  as  well  as  their  2018 
data.  The  IEA  Secretariat  revised  its  data  accordingly.  All  revisions  showed 
rather  small  changes  both  on  the  supply  and  demand  side  for  a  number  of 
energy products.  
Between  September  2015  and  early  2016,  NBS  supplied  the  IEA  with  revised 
energy balances for 2000 to 2013 and the IEA revised its data accordingly. 
All revisions showed significant changes both on the supply and demand side for 
a  number  of  energy  products,  resulting  in  breaks  in  time  series  between  1999 
and 2000.  
Coal 
NBS  and  IEA  collaborate  to  provide  additional  detail  on  energy  production, 
transformation and consumption of all five different types of coal (e.g. anthracite, 
coking  coal,  other  bituminous, sub-bituminous and  lignite).  At the moment  NBS 
only provides quantities of raw coal and washed coal (split between cleaned coal 
and  other  washed  coal)  in  their  energy  balances  and  the  IEA  Secretariat  has 
attributed  these  quantities  to  coking  coal  and  other  bituminous  coal.  It  is 
expected  that  the  continuing  work  to  provide  disaggregated  data  on  the  five 
different coals will result in greater detail in future editions.  
In  the  2018  edition,  NBS  changed  the  definition  of  cleaned  coal  and  other 
washed  coal.  Only  the  coal  used  for  coking  is  called  cleaned  coal.  This  might 
result  in  breaks  in  time  series  in  coking  coal  between  2015  and  2016.  As  this 
change  of  methodology  resulted  in  uncertainty  on  the  use  of  cleaned  coal,  the 
IEA  Secretariat  estimated  the  use  of  coking  coal  in  transformation  and  final 
consumption sectors. 
In  the  2018  edition,  based  on  new  information,  coal  consumption  in  rail  was 
revised  for  the  whole  time  series  to  reflect  the  fact  that  coal  is  used  for  other 
usages than transport in the rail sector. The IEA Secretariat has allocated part of

the  coal  reported  under  rail  to  other  non-specified  sectors  for  the  period  1990-
2003. For the period 2004-2016 the IEA Secretariat allocated the total amount of 
coal reported under rail to other non-specified sectors. 
In the 2018 edition, based on new information, coal inputs to main activity heat 
plants and part of coal inputs to main activity electricity plants were allocated to 
main activity CHP plants for the period 2005-2016. 
Net  calorific  values  (NCV)  for  coal  inputs  to  power  generation  from  2000  are 
estimated  by  applying  assumptions  used  by  China  on  the  average  thermal 
efficiency  of  coal-fired  power  stations  in  these  years.  NCVs  are  also  estimated 
for  bituminous  coal  production  from  2000  as  well  as  for  inputs  to  main  activity 
CHP plants from 2008.  
Since  2000,  imports  and  exports  of  cleaned  coal  are  no  longer  reported  in  the 
national  energy  balance  of  China.  The  IEA  Secretariat  has  used  secondary 
sources  of  information  to  report  this  coking  coal  trade  and  corresponding 
quantities  have  been  removed from  bituminous coal  trade.  Consumption  of this 
coking coal is assumed to be in coke ovens. 
The  IEA  data  of  coal  stocks  for  the  years  1985  and  1990  as  well  as  coal 
production  for  the  years  1997-1999  are  estimates  and  do  not  represent  official 
data released by the Chinese government. Those estimates were based on the 
assumption  that  coal  consumption  statistics  are  more  reliable  than  coal 
production  statistics  and  that  the  production-consumption  relationship  should 
maintain  a  balance  over  time.  In  recent  years,  China  has  reported  large 
increases in stocks for different types of coal. These stock increases are seen as 
consistent with trends in economic growth and development in China; however, 
information is currently lacking on the scale of the infrastructure available for this 
magnitude of stock increases. 
Data  for  coal  trade  in  this  publication  may  not  match  data  from  secondary 
sources of information. 
Oil 
Starting with 2010 data, NBS increased the level of detail of the national energy 
balance regarding oil products and coal gases. Breaks in time series may occur 
between 2009 and 2010. 
In  2012,  new  information  became  available  on  how  NBS  accounts  for 
international aviation and marine bunkers in the China’s national energy balance. 
Previously international flights by Chinese airlines and ships had been excluded.

A revised methodology was implemented that includes fuel use for international 
airplanes and ships, regardless of whether they are foreign- or China-owned. 
Coal  to  liquids  output  was  estimated  based  on  projected  production  slate  of 
operational coal-to-liquid plants. 
In recent years, China has reported large increases in stocks for crude oil and oil 
products. These stock increases are seen as consistent with trends in economic 
growth  and  development  in  China;  however,  information  is  currently  lacking  on 
the scale of the infrastructure available for this magnitude of stock increases. 
In the 2022 edition, a new methodology was developed to adjust refinery yields 
to  crude  oil  inputs  to  refinery.  The  refinery  losses  have  been  revised  with  this 
implementation.  
In the 2022 edition, jet kerosene international aviation bunkers were adjusted in 
line  with  the  decrease  in  emissions  observed  for  international  flights.  Similarly, 
jet  kerosene  consumption  in  the  domestic  aviation  sector  was  also  adjusted  to 
mirror the decrease observed in emissions from domestic flights. 
Natural gas 
In the 2018 edition, based on new information, natural gas inputs to main activity 
heat plants and part of natural gas inputs to main activity electricity plants were 
allocated to main activity CHP plants for the period 2005-2016. 
In the 2012 edition, information became available on natural gas consumption in 
public  transportation  in  China.  This  consumption  was  added  to  the  natural  gas 
time series to ensure proper coverage of the transport sector. 
Coal  to  gas  output  is  estimated  based  on  operational  capacity  of  coal-to-gas 
plants. 
Biofuels and waste 
In  2016,  the  IEA  has  been  working  with  the  Institute  of  Built  Environment  of 
Tsinghua University, Beijing, to improve its data on biomass consumption in the 
residential  sector  in  China.  Biomass  figures  have  therefore  been  revised  in  the 
2016 edition back to 1997 to reflect the results of their study and of IEA analysis.  
Information  became  available  in  2012  from  NBS  on  the  production  and 
consumption  of  gangue,  a  mining  waste  product  that  has  been  classified  as 
industrial  waste  in  the  IEA  energy  balances. This  quantity  of  industrial  waste  is

not likely to represent the only combustion of industrial waste in China; however, 
information is not available to provide more complete data on this activity. 
Time series for liquid biofuels and biogases are based on secondary sources of 
information  and  IEA  Secretariat  estimates.  None  of  these  time  series  are 
reported in the national energy balance of China. 
Electricity and heat 
In the 2018 edition, based on new information, heat production from main activity 
heat  plants  using  coal  and  natural  gas  and  part  of  electricity  production  from 
main activity electricity plants using coal and natural gas were attributed to main 
activity CHP plants from 2005 onwards. 
Estimates  on  the  electricity  consumption  in  road  transportation  are  included, 
starting with 2001 data.  
Electricity  production  from  pumped  storage  hydro  is  reported  from  2010 
onwards. 
Time  series  for  wind  (prior  to  2010),  geothermal,  solar  photovoltaic  and  solar 
thermal  generation  are  based  on  secondary  sources  of  information  and  IEA 
Secretariat  estimates.  None  of  these  time  series  are  reported  in  the  national 
energy balance of China.

Congo 
General notes 
Data for Congo are available starting in 1971.  
In  the  2020,  2021  and  2022  editions,  no  official  2018,  2019  or  2020  annual  oil 
and gas data was available. The IEA Secretariat therefore estimated supply of oil 
and gas based on data from the OPEC and Cedigaz, and consumption based on 
population and economy growth where relevant. Electricity generation figures for 
all  years  were  obtained  from  the  Ministère  de  l'Energie  et  de  l'Hydraulique. 
Historical data for hydroelectricity generation might be slightly revised.  
In  the  2019  edition,  new  data  were  received  from  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and 
Hydraulics for all products in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Breaks in time series might 
appear between 2014 and 2015. 
In the 2016 edition, time series for the period 2000-2012 were revised based on 
energy balances received from the Ministry of Energy. Breaks in time series may 
occur between 1999 and 2000. 
The Imboulou Hydro Plant (120 MW) began operating in May 2011.

Côte d’Ivoire 
General notes 
Data for Côte d’Ivoire are available starting in 1971.  
In  the  2021  edition,  2019  data  were  largely  sourced  from  the  Compagnie 
Ivoirienne d'Electricité and the Direction Générale des Hydrocarbures. 
In  the  2021  edition,  solar  PV  electricity  generation  was  added  starting  in  2000 
based  on  data  provided  by  the  International  Renewable  Energy  Agency 
(IRENA).  Furthermore,  2018  bitumen  data  was  revised  to  reflect  export  data 
provided  by  the  UN  Comtrade  database.  Breaks  in  the  time  series  may  occur 
between 2017 and 2018.  
In  the  2021  edition,  lubricants  production  and  consumption  (2010-2018)  and 
gas/diesel  oil  consumption  (2009-2018)  were  revised  to  represent  the  energy 
system more accurately.  
At the time of preparation of the 2021 edition, no official 2018 data were received 
from the Direction de l’Energie. Thus, 2018 data have been sourced or estimated 
based  on  the  Système  d’Information  Energétique  –  Union  Economique  et 
Monétaire Ouest-Africaine (SIE-UEMOA) web portal data. For several products, 
breaks  in  the  time  series  might  occur  between  2017  and  2018,  and  between 
2014 and 2015.  
In the 2020 edition, the energy industry own use of electricity from 2004 to 2017 
was revised based on newly available information from SIE-UEMOA. 
In  the  2020  edition,  hydropower  electricity  generation  in  2016  and  2017  was 
revised based on newly available information from SIE-UEMOA. 
In  the  2020  edition,  2016  and  2017  final  consumption  of  diesel  was  partially 
reallocated from non-specified industry to mining and quarrying based on newly 
available information from SIE-UEMOA. 
In the 2019 edition, revisions were received for 2016 data from the Direction de 
l’Energie.

Cuba 
General notes 
Data for Cuba are available starting in 1971.  
Figures for crude oil include additives added to reduce viscosity. 
The  IEA  Secretariat  did  not  obtain  all  official  data  for  Cuba  for  2020.  As  a 
consequence,  some  data  points  for  2020  are  based  on  the  Latin  American 
Energy Organization’s (OLADE) balances or the IEA Secretariat’s estimates.  
Official  data  updates  for  2019  were  integrated  in  the  2022  edition,  leading  to 
revisions of 2019 data. 
In the 2022 edition, revisions have been made to fuel oil inputs to main activity 
producer electricity plants in order to utilise published data since 2014. 
In the 2021 edition, revisions were made to crude oil transformation inputs from 
2009 to utilise published data. Revisions were also made to fuel oil estimates for 
international  marine  bunkers  between  since  2009.  In  addition,  estimates  for 
wood consumption from 2006 have been revised across the time series. 
In the 2018 edition, new information became available that led to revisions of the 
wind and solar PV data from 2000 to 2015.  
Breaks in time series in the early 90s are assumed to be due to the codification 
into law of the embargo imposed on Cuba in 1992.

Curaçao 
General notes 
Data for Curaçao are available starting in 1971.  
Refinery  inputs  and  outputs  are  estimated  based  on  the  IEA  Secretariat 
expertise, while the oil demand is estimated based on economic indicators of the 
region. 
In the 2022 edition, some supply and demand flows of gasoline, gas/diesel, fuel 
oil, lubricants and other non-specified oil products have been revised from 1997 
onwards due to new available information on economic indicators of Curaçao.  
Since 2021 edition, the IEA Secretariat estimated oil data for Curaçao from 2017 
onwards  since  no  official  data  on  the  operations  of  the  Isla  refinery  were 
available  by  the  time  this  publication  was  prepared.  It  was  assumed  based  on 
IEA  Secretariat  expert’s  sources,  that  the  refinery  has  been  idle  since  the 
beginning of 2019. 
In the 2020 edition, oil data between 2011 and 2016 as well as crude oil refinery 
input  for  2017  were  revised  to  better  reflect  available  Petróleos  de  Venezuela, 
S.A  (PDVSA)  data  and  to  include  trade  information  for  petroleum  coke  and 
bitumen.  The  Isla  refinery  did  not  operate  for  most  of  2018,  leading  to  a 
significant reduction in refinery activity. 
In the 2020 edition, new information from Aqualectra led to revisions from 2012 
onwards  to  electricity  generation  from  fossil  sources  and  wind,  as  well  as 
electricity demand and diesel/fuel oil inputs to power generation.  
In  the  2018  edition,  new  sources  became  available  that  led  to  revisions  of  the 
solar PV and wind data. This might lead to a break in time series between 2011 
and 2012.  
The  Netherlands  Antilles  was  dissolved  on  10  October  2010,  resulting  in  two 
new constituent countries, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, with the remaining islands 
joining 
the  Netherlands  as  special  municipalities.  The  methodology 
for 
accounting for the energy statistics of the Netherland Antilles has been revised in 
order to follow the above-mentioned geographical changes. From 2012 onwards, 
data now account for the energy statistics of Curaçao Island only. Prior to 2012, 
data  remain  unchanged  and  still  cover  the  entire  territory  of  the  former 
Netherland Antilles. This leads to breaks in time series between 2011 and 2012.

As the Isla refinery did not operate to its maximum capacity in 2010, a break in 
time series might occur in that year for crude oil and oil products.

Cyprus  
General notes 
Note by the Republic of Türkiye (Türkiye): 
The  information  in  this  document  with  reference  to  “Cyprus”  relates  to  the 
southern part of the Island. There is no single authority representing both Turkish 
and Greek Cypriot people on the Island. Türkiye recognizes the Turkish Republic 
of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Until a lasting and equitable solution is found within 
the context of the United Nations, Türkiye shall preserve its position concerning 
the “Cyprus issue”. 
Note  by  all  the  European  Union  member  states  of  the  OECD  and  the 
European Union: 
The Republic of Cyprus is recognized by all members of the United Nations with 
the  exception  of  Türkiye.  The  information  in  this  document  relates  to  the  area 
under the effective control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. 
Data for Cyprus are available starting in 1971.  
In the 2022 edition, the entire time series (2007-2019) of geothermal indigenous 
production and final consumption in the residential sector were reclassified from 
geothermal energy to ambient heat by Cyprus. Consequently, these data are no 
longer represented in the energy balance or statistics. 
In the 2021 edition, net calorific values reported by Cyprus were used to convert 
physical data to energy units. In previous years, IEA standard net calorific values 
were  used.  As  a  result,  the  time  series  of  liquefied  petroleum  gases,  kerosene 
type jet fuel excluding biofuels, other kerosene, gas/diesel oil excluding biofuels, 
fuel  oil,  lubricants,  bitumen,  and  petroleum  coke  were  revised  from  1990-2018. 
Breaks in the time series may occur between 1989 and 1990 for these products. 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  time  series  of  primary  solid  biofuels  were  revised  from 
2009-2010 based on newly available information. Breaks in the time series may 
occur between 2008 and 2009 for these products.

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea 
General notes 
Data  for  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  are  available  starting  in 
1971.  
The sources cited below provide domestic supply data for DPR Korea. All other 
flows are estimated by the IEA Secretariat.  
In the 2021 edition, final consumption data of electricity, secondary oil products 
and primary coal products are estimated from 2017 onwards based on economic 
structure from neighbouring China provinces of Liaoning and Jilin. 
In  the  2021  edition,  power  efficiencies  for  other  bituminous  coal  from  2009 
onwards were adjusted to reflect the status of technology in DPR Korea. 
In  the  2020  edition,  solar  PV  electricity  generation  was  estimated  from  2001 
onwards, using IRENA data.  
In the 2020 edition, 2016 anthracite production was revised, using data reported 
by Statistics Korea. 
In  the  2019  edition,  data  for  2017  anthracite  production  by  Statistics  Korea 
became  available;  as  trade  data  are  estimated  based  on  reported  importers’ 
data, this might result in statistical differences.  
In  the  2014  edition,  2011  data  for  primary  coals  were  revised  based  on  new 
information. This may lead to breaks in the time series between 2010 and 2011 
and differences in trends compared to previous editions for some products.

Democratic Republic of the Congo 
General notes 
Data for the Democratic Republic of the Congo are available starting in 1971.  
Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo  is  one  of  the  ten  countries  that  benefit  from 
EU Support to IEA Data for Affordable and Sustainable Energy System for Sub-
Saharan Africa. 
In the 2021 edition, no official 2019 annual energy data was available. The IEA 
Secretariat  therefore  estimated  the  2019  dataset  based  on  secondary  sources 
and data partially available on electricity generation and oil products. 
In the 2020 edition, the IEA secretariat added available off-grid solar photovoltaic 
from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) for 2011 – 2018.  
In  the  2019  edition  data  became  available  for  the  split  of  consumption  in 
industry. Breaks in time series may occur between 2016 and 2017 for electricity 
data.  
In the 2015 edition, new information and methodologies regarding solid biofuels 
including  charcoal  became  available.  Breaks  in time-series may  occur  between 
2013 and 2014.

Dominican Republic 
General notes 
Data for the Dominican Republic are available starting in 1971.  
In  the  2022  edition,  the  2019  and  2020  national  energy  balance  were  not 
available  at  the time  of publication. Therefore,  2019  and  2020 flows  have  been 
estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat,  based  on  OLADE  data  or  economic  trends, 
where relevant.  
In  the  2021  edition,      coking  coal  has  been  reclassified  as  petroleum  coke 
following information from the Comisión nacional de energía (CNE). 
In  the  2020  edition,  data  for  the  years  1998  to  2017  were  revised  following 
revision of the official data from Comisión nacional de energía (CNE).  
In the 2019 edition, a breakdown of transport consumption was added thanks to 
new information from Comisión nacional de energía (CNE) starting in 1998. 
In  the  2017  edition,  a  breakdown  of  consumption  data  in  industry,  residential, 
commerce and services was added starting from 1998. 
In  the  2014  edition,  the  national  energy  balance  was  adopted  as  the  primary 
data source. This could lead to breaks in time series between 1997 and 1998 for 
some flows.

Ecuador 
General notes 
Data for Ecuador are available starting in 1971.  
Crude  oil  production  and  export  data  do  not  include  field  condensate.  Field 
condensate quantities are included with natural gas liquids. 
In  the  2022  edition,  2018  and  2019  data  for  Ecuador  were  revised  to  reflect 
revisions  of  official  data  from  the  Instituto  de  Investigación  Geológico  y 
Energético. This may lead to breaks in the time series between 2017 and 2018. 
In  particular,  the  biggest  changes  regard  refinery  gas  production  and  use  and 
diesel  and  fuel  oil  final  consumption  in  industry  and  commercial  and  public 
services.  
In  the  2020  edition,  data  for  Ecuador  were  revised  for  the  years  2000  to  2006, 
following revision of official data from the Instituto de Investigación Geológico y 
Energético. This may lead to breaks in the time series between 1999 and 2000. 
Revisions  also  include  non-energy  use  of  oil  products  between  1992  and  1999 
as new information became available. 
In  the  2019  edition,  data  for  Ecuador  were  revised  for  the  years  2007  to  2016, 
following revision of the official data from Instituto de Investigación Geológico y 
Energético for national and international bunkers for oil products. 
In  the  2019  edition,  solid  biofuels  data  for  the  years  2007-2016  were  revised. 
This leads to different figures compared to previous editions.

Egypt 
General notes 
Data for Egypt are available starting in 1971.  
Data  are  reported  on  a  fiscal  year  basis.  Data  for  2020  correspond  to  1  July 
2020 - 30 June 2021. 
Stock changes may include informal trade. 
In the 2022 edition, new information from CAPMAS became available to the IEA 
Secretariat, leading to revisions in primary and secondary oil data for years 2018 
and 2019 as well as coal data for the same period. Trade data for these product 
aggregates has also been revised for the period 2014-2019.  
In the 2022 edition, electricity output from natural gas plants was revised for the 
period 2008-2019 as new information regarding private sector power plants was 
collected by the IEA Secretariat. 
In the 2022 edition, natural gas final consumption in road transport was revised 
for years 2018 and 2019 using new information provided by EGAS. 
In  the  2021  edition,  new  information  became  available  to  the  IEA  Secretariat, 
leading to revision of trade and production for primary solid biofuels and charcoal 
for the whole time series. 
In the 2021 edition, due to a more accurate use of official data, gas condensate 
data have been revised from 2014 to 2018. 
In the 2020 edition, the IEA Secretariat revised primary solid biofuel data back to 
1971.  Data  are  now  based  on  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organisation  (FAO), 
growth of solid biofuels production and consumption. Charcoal production, trade 
and use have been estimated based on FAO data.  
In the 2020 edition, importation and consumption of other bituminous coal have 
been revised for the years 2014 to 2017, as new information became available. 
This may lead to break in time series between 2013 and 2014.  
In  the  2020  edition,  input  of  natural  gas  to  power  plants  as  well  as  natural  gas 
final  consumption  in  2017  were  revised  based  on  new  data  received  from 
CAPMAS and EGAS.

El Salvador 
General notes 
Data for El Salvador are available starting in 1971.  
In the 2021 edition, imports and exports of oil products were revised from 2013 
onwards, to exclude transit trade.  
In the  2020  edition,  bagasse  data  were  revised for  the  years  1998-2012  based 
on new information from El Salvador’s Consejo Nacional de Energía (CNE) and 
IEA  Secretariat  estimates.  Data  for  coke  oven  coke  and  petroleum  coke  have 
been  revised  for  the  years  1994-2018  following  new  trade  information  from  the 
Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador. Petroleum coke demand is estimated 
by the IEA Secretariat. 
In the 2019 edition, data for El Salvador for the years 2014 to 2016 have been 
revised across all products and flows following revision of the official data from El 
Salvador’s CNE.  
In  the  2019  edition,  solid  biofuels  data  for  the  years  2000-2016  have  been 
revised. This leads to a break in time series between 1999 and 2000. Data from 
2007  onwards  were  updated  based  on  CNE’s  balance.  This  leads  to  breaks  in 
time series for wood and charcoal between 2006 and 2007, and between 2013 
and 2014 in which years El Salvador updated their data thanks to a new survey. 
The only refinery in El Salvador shut down in 2012.

Equatorial Guinea 
General notes 
Data for Equatorial Guinea are available starting in 1971. 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  time  series  of  several  products  were  heavily  revised 
based  on  changes  to  the  IEA  Secretariat  methodology  and  updated  data 
received  from  the  United  Nations  Statistical  Division.  These  products  and  their 
respective  start  of  revisions  include:  primary  solid  biofuels  (1981),  charcoal 
(1981), natural gas (1998), crude oil (2000), natural gas liquids (1995), liquified 
petroleum  gas  (1990),  motor  gasoline  (1990),  jet  kerosene  (2000),  other 
kerosene  (2000),  gas/diesel  oil  (1990),  lubricants  (2000),  bitumen  (2000)  and 
electricity (1998). 
In  the  2021  edition,  numerous  revisions  were  made  to  reflect  national  data 
published by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística de Guinea Ecuatorial (INEGE). 
These  revisions  affect:  crude  oil  production,  exports,  and  energy  industry  own 
use (2006-2018), LPG exports and transfers (2006-2018), NGL transfers (2006-
2018),  production,  and  exports  (2017-2018),  natural  gas  exports  (2013-2018) 
and  own  use  in  gas-to-liquids  plants  (2017-2018),  motor  gasoline  imports  and 
consumption  (2017-2018),  jet  kerosene  imports,  international  aviation  bunkers, 
and  consumption 
(2017-2018),  other  kerosene 
imports  and 
residential 
consumption  (2017-2018),  gas/diesel  oil  input  to  electricity  plants,  output  from 
electricity  plants  (2015-2018),  and  consumption  (2017-2018),  and  finally, 
electricity use for oil and gas extraction (2016-2018).  
In  the  2021  edition,  several  other  gas/diesel  oil  flows  were  revised  to  better 
accommodate  the  information  published  by  INEGE.  Consumption  data  is  now 
sourced from OPEC for 2014-2015 and imports are now sourced from UNSD for 
2017-2018.  
Furthermore,  revisions  to  OPEC  data  resulted  in  changes  to  natural  gas 
production (2012-2017) and  exports  (2012)  in the  2021  edition. Other revisions 
to  natural  gas  flows  include  industry  consumption  (2016-2018)  and  LNG 
production  and  exports  (2007-2018).  Finally,  residential  electricity  consumption 
was also revised from 2017-2018.

Eritrea 
General notes 
Data for Eritrea are available starting in 1992. Prior to 1992, data are included in 
Ethiopia. 
At the time of preparation of the 2022 edition, no official data were available from 
Eritrea from 2019 to 2020. Official data were also not available for most products 
and  flows  for  2018.  As  a  consequence,  the  statistics  and  balances  for  2018  to 
2019 have been mostly estimated based on data from the UNSD. Data for 2020 
have  been  estimated  based  on  population  growth  for  biomass  and  household 
consumption, and GDP growth for other products. 
In  the  2022  edition,  most  products  and  flows  were  revised  from  2011  to  2017 
based on new data provided by the Ministry of Energy and Mines.  
In  the  2021  edition,  2018  data  for  jet  kerosene  and  gas/diesel  oil  were  revised 
based  on  information  provided  by  OAG  and  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines, 
respectively.  This  leads to  breaks  in  time series.  Uses  of  naphtha for  electricity 
generation for 2007-2009 were also revised due to new data available.  
In the 2021 edition, main activity producer electricity output from solar PV (2011-
2016)  and  non-specified  oil  products  (2011-2018)  was  revised  to  reflect  data 
published  by  the  African  Development  Bank Group  (AFDB)  and  African Energy 
Commission  (AFREC).  Solar  PV  electricity  output  for  2018  was  also  modified 
based  on  revisions  made  by  the  International  Renewable  Energy  Agency 
(IRENA). Consequently, total electricity production and consumption flows were 
revised from 2011-2018. Breaks in time series may occur. 
In the 2020 edition, the IEA Secretariat received from the Ministry of Energy and 
Mines partial solar photovoltaic generation and other electricity and data as well 
as  oil  products  consumption figures for  2017,  and fuel  oil  total  consumption for 
2018.  Based  on  this  newly  available  information,  the  IEA  Secretariat  revised 
imports  of  fuel  oil,  diesel,  motor  gasoline,  lubricants  and  LPG  for  2017  and 
imports of LPG and lubricants between 2011 and 2016. Furthermore, electricity 
generation  from  solar  photovoltaics  was  revised  in  2017,  leading  to  a  break  in 
time series between 2016 and 2017. 
In the 2019 edition, OAG data were used to estimate the breakdown of aviation 
fuels  between  domestic  aviation  and  international  aviation  bunkers  between 
2005 and 2017. Breaks in time series might occur between 2004 and 2005.

Kingdom of Eswatini 
General notes 
Data for the Kingdom of Eswatini (Eswatini) are available starting in 1971.  
Data from the Eswatini Electricity Company are reported on a fiscal year basis. 
Data for 2020 correspond to 1 April 2020 – 31 March 2021. This source is used 
for  several  electricity 
flows  starting 
in  2005, 
including 
imports, 
losses, 
consumption (until 2015), and output from hydro.  
At  the  time  of  preparation  of  the  2022  edition,  official  data  from  the  Eswatini 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Energy were not yet available for 2020. 2020 
data are therefore entirely estimated by the IEA Secretariat based on secondary 
sources or economic growth, except for electricity flows for which data from the 
Eswatini Electricity Company are used.

Ethiopia 
General notes 
Data for Ethiopia are available starting in 1971.  
Ethiopia is one of the ten countries that benefit from EU Support to IEA Data for 
Affordable and Sustainable Energy System for Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Ethiopia energy data include Eritrea from 1971 to 1991. From 1992 onwards, the 
two countries are reported separately. 
Data  are reported  according  to  the  Ethiopian financial  year.  For  instance,  2020 
data  refers  to  the  fiscal  year  starting  on  1st  of  July  2020  and  ending  on  30th  of 
June 2021, or 2013 in Ethiopian fiscal years.  
At the  time  of preparation  of the  2022  edition,  limited  2020  data  were  available 
from  official  sources.  2020  data  for  several  products  are  therefore  entirely 
estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on  economic  indicators.  2019  data 
estimated for the 2021 edition were replaced based on new data provided by the 
Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and Energy, hence the revisions in the database. 
At the time of preparation of the 2021 edition, 2019 official data for Ethiopia were 
not  available  yet.  2019  data  are  therefore  entirely  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat  based  on  available  secondary  sources  and  population  or  economic 
growth.  2018  data  estimated  for  the  2020  edition  were  replaced  by  official 
Ethiopia data for this edition, hence the revisions in the database. 
In  the  2020  edition,  solar  photovoltaic  off-grid  generation  was  revised  down 
following  revision  by  International  Renewable  Energy  Agency  (IRENA)  of  its 
estimation.  
In  the  2020  edition,  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  data  were 
used  to  estimate  the  split  of  aviation  fuels  between  domestic  aviation  and 
international  aviation  bunkers  from  2005  onwards.  Breaks  in  time  series  might 
occur between 2004 and 2005. 
In the 2017 edition, electricity data were revised based on ministry reporting split 
between wind and geothermal production since 2011.  
The Aluto Langano pilot geothermal power plant began an expansion project in 
2010.  Breaks  in  geothermal  time  series  can  be  seen  in  2010  due  to  the  plant 
being out of commission.

Gabon 
General notes 
Data for Gabon are available starting in 1971.  
In the 2022 edition, the IEA Secretariat obtained data on the oil sector in Gabon 
in year 2020 through information published by the Ministère de l’Economie et de 
la Relance. This led to revisions in oil and oil products supply data between 2017 
and 2019. 
In  the  2021  edition,  2018  and  2019  data  were  not  available  by  the  time  this 
publication was prepared. Data were therefore estimated by the IEA secretariat. 
New data from the SEEG led to revision of electricity data from 2016 to 2018.  
The use of the AFREC questionnaire data for 2017 lead to break in time series 
for  LPG,  non-bio  gasoline,  non-bio  jet-kerosene,  other  kerosene  and  non-bio 
diesel. 
In the 2018 edition, revisions to natural gas production were made from 2013 to 
2015. Breaks in time series can be seen from 2013 to 2014.  
In  the  2017  edition,  revisions  were  made  to  the  residential  oil  products 
consumption  from  the  time  period  of  2010  to  2014  to  take  into  account  newly 
available data. This may result in a break in time series between 2009 and 2010 
for  LPG  and  kerosene.  Revisions  were  made  for  crude  oil  production  for  the 
whole time series.

Georgia 
General notes 
Data for Georgia are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included in 
Former Soviet Union.  
Georgia is one of the 11 EU4Energy focus countries. 
Energy data for Georgia do not include Abkhazia and South Ossetia, except for 
the electricity questionnaire. Part of the electricity generated in the Enguri HPP is 
transferred  to  Abkhazia  and  accounted  for  in  the  electricity  balance  as  non-
specified consumption. 
In 2015, a refinery started operating in Georgia. 
For  the  period  2015-2017,  trade  of  crude  oil  includes  a  share  of  crude  oil 
blended with fuel oil. This explains breaks in time series from 2014. 
In 2015, trade of natural gas for the year might include re-export. 
Between 2014 and 2015, a break in stock level time series appears for some oil 
products  as  the  National  Statistical  Office  (GEOSTAT)  received  more  detailed 
information on stocks of oil products. 
Between  2012  and  2013,  breaks  in  time series may  appear for  some  products, 
as  data  collection  and  submission  to  the  IEA  became  the  responsibility  of  the 
National  Statistical  Office  (GEOSTAT),  whereas  it  used  to  be  done  by  the 
Energy Efficiency Centre.  
For  the  period  1990-2012,  natural  gas  data  are  reported  at  temperature  and 
pressure conditions of 20°C and 101.325 kPa, respectively. 
Since 2011, heat production has stopped due to the shutdown of combined heat 
and power plants.

Ghana 
General notes 
Data for Ghana are available starting in 1971.  
Ghana is one of the ten countries that benefit from EU Support to IEA Data for 
Affordable and Sustainable Energy System for Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Production from the TEN field started in 2016 and from the Sankofa Gye Nyame 
(SGN)  field  in  2017.  Two  new  producing  wells  were  added  to  the  SGN  field  in 
2019.  Breaks  in  time  series  might  occur  between  2016  and  2017  in  crude  oil 
production, and between 2018 and 2019 for natural gas production. 
In  the  2022  edition,  international  marine  bunkers  and  exports  of  gas/diesel  oil 
(2017-2019)  were  revised  to match  data  published  by  the  Energy  Commission. 
Imports (2015-2019) and industry consumption (2017-2019) of fuel oil were also 
revised based on new data in Energy Commission publications.  
In  the  2021  edition,  data  were  added  for  main  activity  electricity  plants  and 
electricity  generation  for  LPG  (2018-2019),  gas/diesel  oil  (2011-2019),  and  fuel 
oil  (2015-2019)  based  on  new  official  sources.  LPG  consumption  flows  (2017-
2018)  and  fuel  oil  imports  (2015-2018)  were  also  affected.  Furthermore, 
revisions  were  made  to  reflect  data  provided  by  the  United  Nations  Statistical 
Division  for  aviation  gasoline  imports  (2009-2018)  and  international  aviation 
bunkers  (1996-2018),  gas/diesel  oil  exports  and  international  marine  bunkers 
(2009-2018),  and 
imports  and  non-energy  use  of  bitumen  (1996-2018), 
lubricants (1999-2018), and non-specified petroleum products (1996-2018). 
In  the  2019  edition,  fuelwood  time  series  from  2008  to  2016  were  revised  as 
Ghana published new data. Breaks in time series might occur between 2007 and 
2008.  
In 2014, Ghana started to exploit gas that was previously flared. 
In the 2015 edition, primary solid biofuels figures for 2000-2012 were revised, as 
new  information  became  available.  Breaks  in  time  series  might  occur  between 
1999 and 2000. 
In  the  2014  edition,  data  were  revised  for  electricity,  oil  products  and  biofuels 
until  2000  and  from  2009  to  2012  based  on  new  information  received  from  the 
Energy Commission. Breaks in time series may occur for these products.

Gibraltar 
General notes 
Data for Gibraltar are available starting in 1971.  
Since the 2019 edition, data from 2016 onwards were estimated since no edition 
of  the  Abstract  of  Statistics  has  been  published  beyond  2016.  Electricity 
generation from fuel oil has been revised for 2016. 
In  the  2015  edition,  the  time  series  for  residual  fuel  oil  and  gas/diesel  oil 
consumed  as  international  marine  bunkers  were  revised  based  on  newly 
available information.

Guatemala 
General notes 
Data for Guatemala are available starting in 1971.  
In  the  2022  edition,  electricity  generation  in  a  new  natural  gas  power  plant  is 
reported  for  the  year  2020,  for  the  first  time  in  the  time  series,  to  take  into 
account  new  information  provided  by  Administrador  del  Mercado  Mayorista. 
Natural gas production in Guatemala and consumption in main activity electricity 
producers are therefore estimated for that year.  
In  the  2021  edition,  there  are  revisions  to  the  domestic  consumption  of  jet 
kerosene  between  2005  and  2010.  There  may  now  be  a  break  in  time  series 
between  2004  and  2005.  Additionally,  international  aviation  bunkers  values 
between 2010 and 2012 were revised. 
The  2021  edition  also  includes  revisions  to  estimated  solid  biofuel  electricity 
plant outputs between 1986 and 1997. There are also revisions across the time 
series for biogasoline production and exports, in order to change sources for this 
information. 
In the 2020 edition, data for 2001 to 2009 were revised to take into account new 
information  from  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines.  Breaks  in  time  series  may 
occur between 2000 and 2001.  
In  the  2019  edition,  data  on  the  production  and  export  of  liquid  biofuels  were 
added for the years 2005-2017.  
New information on the domestic consumption of jet kerosene became available 
in the 2019 edition for the years 2010-2017. The consequent revisions may lead 
to break in time series between 2009 and 2010. 
In the 2018 edition, data for 2010 to 2015 were revised to take into account new 
information from the ministry of energy and mines.  
Orimulsion  was  imported  between  2004  and  2006 for  electricity generation  and 
is reported under “other hydrocarbons”. 
Electricity generation from primary solid biofuels from 1998 to 2000 is in mobile 
harvest  year,  which  does  not fully  coincide  with  calendar  year.  Harvest  year  Y-
1/Y corresponds to year Y in IEA data. 
The Texaco refinery in Escuintla ceased operations in 2002.

Guyana 
General notes 
Data for Guyana are available starting in 1971. 
Guyana  started  extracting  commercial  grade  crude  oil  from  Liza  oilfield  in 
December    2019.  The  2022  edition  shows  the  resulting  increase  of  crude  oil 
production  and  exports  in  2020  as  well  of  non-specified  oil  products  (mostly 
lubricants) used in the extraction operations. 
The  IEA  Secretariat  added  Guyana  energy  data  to  the World  Energy  Statistics 
and Balances in the 2021 edition. In previous editions the data were included in 
“Other non-OECD Americas” region.

Haiti 
General notes 
Data for Haiti are available starting in 1971.  
In the  2022  edition,  inputs  to  power generation for  2020  were  estimated by  the 
IEA Secretariat due to national data not being available at the time of publication. 
In the 2022 edition, electricity generation data was revised for the year 2019 as 
new  data  became  available  in  Ministère  de  l’Economie  et  des  Finances  de  la 
République d’Haïti. 
In  the  2021  edition,  inputs  to  power  generation  and  electricity  generation  by 
source for 2019 were estimated by the IEA Secretariat due to national data not 
being available at the time of publication. 
In  the  2020  edition,  inputs  to  power generation  and  generation  by  source  were 
updated from 2010 onwards to reflect information from the Ministry of Economy 
and Finances. This may lead to breaks in time series between 2009 and 2010. 
Imports  of oil  products were  updated from  1998  to reflect  new  information from 
the Central Bank of Haiti and available mirror trade information.  
In  the  2020  edition,  solid  biofuels  data  were  also  revised  up  to  2008  to  reflect 
revised information from Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE).  
In  the  2020  edition,  liquid  biofuels  data  were  also  added  to  reflect  revised 
information  from  OLADE.  Ethanol  production  data  starts  in  2012,  while  import 
data from 2010 is sourced from the US Energy Information Administration. 
Solar  photovoltaic  generation  has  been  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  using 
OLADE capacity estimates.

Honduras 
General notes 
Data for Honduras are available starting in 1971.  
In  the  2022  edition,  new  official  data  for  all  energy  products  and  flows  from 
Secretaría de Estado en el Despacho de Energía became available through the 
sieHONDURAS  online  platform,  for  the  period  2010-2020.  As  a  result  of  this, 
energy statistics and balances of these years have been completely revised.  
In the 2021 edition, autoproducer electricity generation from bagasse and fuel oil 
have  been  revised  for  years  2017  and  2018  to  reflect  new  information  on 
cogeneration. As a result of this, 2017 and 2018 inputs to autoproducer plants of 
fuel oil have been revised, as well as 2017 total electricity generation. 
In  the  2020  edition,  direct  communication  with  the  Secretaría  de  Estado  en  el 
Despacho de Energía led to revisions of data since 2005. The revisions made to 
integrate  this  information  can  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series  between  2004  and 
2005. Data for coke oven coke were revised to zero and corresponding amounts 
subsequently re-allocated to petroleum coke.

Hong Kong, China  
General notes 
Data for Hong Kong, China are available starting in 1971.  
Due  to  lack  of  available  data,  the  input  of  biogas  to  CHP  plants  may  include 
biogas used for industrial heat.  
In the 2021 edition, the 2000 to 2019 time series for fuel oil and diesel input to 
main activity plants was revised to include new information available on the split 
of the two fuels. Breaks in time series may occur between 1999 and 2000. Prior 
to 2000, fuel oil input to power plants may include some quantities of diesel. 
In the 2021 edition, consumption data for coal were revised over the whole time 
series  to  take  into  account  information  received  from  the  Hong  Kong  Electrical 
and Mechanical Services Department. The revisions result in higher use of coal 
for electricity production, and very little use of coal in the industry sector. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  naphtha  time  series  was  revised  to  represent  the 
blending to town gas more accurately. 
Information  on  the  solid  biofuels  and  waste  data  was  received  from  the  local 
contacts,  which  led  to  the  revision  of  the fuelwood  time  series to  zero  as  Hong 
Kong, China, only uses charcoal.  
The IEA Secretariat added data for solar PV electricity generation data from auto 
producers in the 2021 edition, as available from APERC.  
In the 2021 edition, stock changes data for 2019 were estimated.  
In  the  2020  edition,  official  data  for  stock  changes  of  coal  and  oil  products 
became available for 2018. This may lead to breaks in time series between 2017 
and 2018. 
In the  2020  edition,  data for  electricity  losses  and  own  use  breakdown  became 
available  from  1996  onwards.  For  the  period  1971-1995,  electricity  losses 
include electricity own use. 
In  the  2016  edition,  trade  data  for  various  petroleum  products  were  revised 
based on newly available information. Breaks in time series may occur between 
2000 and 2001.

General notes 
Data for India are available starting in 1971.  
India joined the IEA as an Association country in March 2017. 
Data  are  reported  by  India  on  a  fiscal  year  basis.  Data  for  2020  correspond  to 
1 April 2020 – 31 March 2021. This convention is different from the one used by 
Government of India, whereby 2020 data would refer to fiscal year 1 April 2019 – 
31 March 2020. 
Coal 
In the 2021 edition several transformation and consumption flows are based on 
growth  of  total  energy  supply  for  a  given  product,  as  official  data  are  not  yet 
available.  
In the 2015 edition, significant revisions of the net calorific values of the different 
types of coal were made for the whole time series, based on official data as well 
as  IEA  and  other  experts’  estimates.  As  a  result,  there  have  been  significant 
changes  for  the  coal  data  when  presented  in  energy  units,  as  well  as  in  the 
calculated efficiency of coal fired power generation. Data on the production and 
consumption of secondary coal products may have also been revised as a result. 
The net calorific values of coking coal, sub-bituminous coal and other bituminous 
coal,  were  revised  again  in  the  2018  edition to take  into  account  more  detailed 
information on imports and IEA Secretariat experts estimates.  
From 2008, due to a notable discrepancy between official coal imports from India 
and  coal  exports  to  India  as  reported  by  trade  partners,  imports  of  coking  coal 
and  non-coking  coal  are  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat,  based  on  trade 
partners’  data.  The  breakdown  of  non-coking  coal  imports  between  bituminous 
coal and sub-bituminous coal is estimated from 2008. This could lead to breaks 
in time series between 2007 and 2008.  
Coking  coal  figures  for  India  do  not  align  with  IEA  definitions  as  they  include 
production of non-metallurgical coking coal reported by India.  
Due  to  data  limitations,  IEA  Secretariat  estimates  are  used  for  some  products 
and flows, including supply and demand of coke oven gas and blast furnace gas. 
Coke  oven  coke  production  is  estimated  from  2006  based  on  growth  of  blast

furnace  iron  production,  as  official  production  data  do  not  include  production 
from small private producers. 
Oil 
In the 2020 edition, input to autoproducers of electricity were revised from 2008 
onwards  based  on  data  on  their  power  generation  reported  by  the  Central 
Electricity  Authority.  In  parallel,  several final  consumption flows  were  revised  to 
incorporate sales from retailers. 
In  the  2018  edition,  petroleum  coke  consumption  by  the  non-metallic  mineral 
industries was revised based on information on cement production estimated by 
the IEA  Secretariat  based  on  United  States Geological  Survey  Mineral  Industry 
Report  on  India.  This  may  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series  as  well  as  differences 
with previous editions. 
In the  2014  edition,  information  on stock changes  of  crude  oil  and  oil  products, 
available  from  the  JODI  database  from  April  2011,  was  added.  Breaks  in  time 
series may appear in stock changes between 2010 and 2011.  
In  the  2014  edition,  refinery  intake  was  split  between  crude  oil  and  refinery 
feedstocks from 1999 based on data available by the Ministry of Petroleum and 
Natural Gas. The refinery feedstocks reported by the IEA Secretariat correspond 
to the quantities officially reported as “other inputs” to Reliance Refineries. They 
do not include additives and refinery feedstocks to other Indian refineries. These 
missing inputs could reach up to 2.5 million tonnes. 
Data for diesel consumption from 2008 are partially based on an official survey 
on  the  end  use  of  diesel  retail  sales.  The  IEA  Secretariat  classifies  the  diesel 
used  in  mobile  phone  towers  and  non-industry  power  generators  as  input  to 
autoproducer  electricity  generation.  A  corresponding  electricity  output 
is 
estimated. 
No NGL production is officially reported by India. The NGL production estimated 
by  the  IEA  Secretariat  corresponds  to  the  production  of  oil  products  from  gas 
separation plants, known in India as “fractionators”. In the IEA methodology, the 
output  of  oil  products  from  gas  separation  plants  comes  from  an  input  of  NGL 
and the separation process is shown in the transfer row. Prior to 2005-2006, the 
split  of  fractionator  output  between  petroleum  products  is  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat.  
No  breakdown  of  refinery  fuel  by  products  is  currently  officially  available. 
Refinery gas  production is  estimated  based  on  expected  refinery  output for  the

years  where  using  official  data  would  lead  to  refinery  gains.  Due  to  notable 
breaks in official data for fuel oil, consumption of fuel oil in international marine 
bunkers  is  estimated  between  1990  and  2002  based  on  industry  sources  and 
from 2003 onwards based on Ministry of Shipping cargo data; final consumption 
of  fuel  oil  is  estimated  from  2004  based  on  2003  data  and  official  trends  from 
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. 
Natural gas 
In  the  2020  edition,  inputs  to main  activity  producers  of  electricity  were  revised 
from  2010  onwards,  based  on  data  reported  by  the  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and 
Natural Gas. Before 2010 inputs to main activity power plants are estimated by 
the IEA Secretariat.  
In  the  2020  edition,  use  of  natural  gas  in  oil  refineries  was  added  from  2008 
onwards based on data reported by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. 
Before 2008 there is no data reported for this flow. 
In the  2020  edition,  total final consumption  of natural gas  was revised from the 
start of the time series based on data reported by the Ministry of Petroleum and 
Natural Gas. 
Natural gas imports for India from 2008 onwards are based on Indian Customs 
data, in order to include all LNG importers.  
No  data  are  officially  available  on  the  sectoral  consumption  of  re-gasified  LNG 
and city gas. The breakdown is estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
Biofuels and waste 
In  the  2021  edition,  changes  of  methodology  were  implemented  to  revise  the 
data of solid, liquid and gaseous biofuels, thanks to a study by The Energy and 
Resources Institute "TERI", funded by the Clean Energy Transition Programme. 
The  scope  of  data  collection  for  certain  products  is  increased.  Full  time  series 
were  revised  for  fuelwood,  agricultural  residues,  bagasse,  biogases  and 
bioethanol.  For  solid  biofuels,  the  magnitude  of  the  revision  is  stronger  for  the 
historical data: from 20% in the 1970s to less than 5% in the last five years. 
Fuelwood supply is estimated using data from Forest Survey of India, especially 
looking  at  fuelwood  used  for  energy  usages.  Residential  consumption  is 
estimated based on households’ reliance of fuelwood for cooking.

Transformation  of  fuelwood  into  charcoal  is  estimated  based  on  an  updated 
efficiency factor expressed in mass unit, and is then converted to energy unit. 
The demand for charcoal is revised from 2001 onwards, creating a break in time 
series.  The  revision  takes  into  account  residential  consumption  of  charcoal  for 
cooking, estimated using households’ reliance on charcoal for cooking. Charcoal 
not  consumed  by  households  is  allocated  to  industry  consumption.  Industry 
consumption of charcoal is not estimated before 2001. 
Vegetal  materials  and  residues’  supply  is  estimated  using  both  data  on 
agricultural  crops  production  from  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  and  the  surplus 
availability  factor  published  by  the  Technology  Information  Forecasting  and 
Assessment  Council  of  India.  Agricultural  residues  consumption  by  households 
is estimated based on their reliance of the latter for cooking. 
Bagasse production of combined heat and power is estimated by recouping two 
sources  of  information.  Bagasse  production  is  estimated  based  on  sugarcane 
production  considering  both  sugar  processing  units  and  jaggery  units.  As 
electricity and heat are a by-products of these facilities, they are reported under 
the category auto-producer CHP plants. Electricity generation is estimated using 
CEA  data  and  recouped  with  MNRE  data  on  installed  on-grid  and  off-grid 
capacity. From 2016 onwards, surplus and non-surplus electricity generated are 
estimated. Up to 2015, non-surplus electricity is estimated to ensure continuity of 
the time series. Electricity used to power the plants and electricity used for sugar 
processing  are  estimated  in  the  balance  by  considering  an  average  bagasse-
based  processing  unit.  The  heat  produced  from  bagasse  and  directly  used  by 
the  sugar  industry  is  tracked  by  its  bagasse  input,  measured  as  the  residual 
bagasse not used for electricity generation. 
Biogas  production  scope  is  widened  in  the  2021  edition,  covering  not  only  the 
biogas  used  in  power  production,  but  also  estimating  direct  final  consumption. 
Anaerobic  and  thermal  technologies  to  produce  biogas  are  taken  into  account, 
using  data  published  in  the  Annual  Report  of  the  Ministry  of  New  and 
Renewables  Energy.  Data  includes  the  family  scale  biogas  program,  the 
community  scale  biogas  program,  the  bio-CNG  and  the  biogas  produced  in 
industry.  Thermal  gasification  processes  are  also  covered,  based  on  installed 
capacity data published by MNRE and IEA Secretariat estimation. 
In  the  2021  edition,  bioethanol  production  figures  are  based  on  official  data 
published  by  the  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Gas.  Demand  figures  are 
based  on  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  estimates  for  the  calendar 
year.

Biodiesel  demand  and  supply  are  based  on  the  data  published  by  the  United 
States Department of Agriculture estimates for the calendar year. 
Electricity and heat 
Data  for  total  electricity  generation  include  estimates  for  electricity  generation 
from  diesel  by  non-industrial  autoproducers  as  well  as  off-grid  electricity 
generation from renewable energy. 2020 data on the electricity consumption by 
industrial sub-sector are estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
Only  information  on  total  on-grid  generation  from  renewables  is  officially 
available.  The  breakdown  between  sources  was  estimated  by 
the 
IEA 
Secretariat from 2007 using official data on capacities from MNRE. Total off-grid 
generation  and  split  by  sources  are  estimated  based  on  capacities  from  2007 
onward.  
Solar  power  generation  data  reported  by  CEA  include  both  solar  photovoltaic 
(PV) generation and concentrated solar power generation. It is currently reported 
in the solar PV commodity balance. The IEA Secretariat solar thermal data only 
include what derives from heat systems. 
Output  of  biomass  power  generation  and  bagasse  co-generation  is  reported 
altogether  as  output  of  autoproducer  electricity  plants.  Up  to  2015  data,  it  only 
includes  the  surplus  power  generation  sold  to  the  grid.  From  2016  onwards, 
capacity  data  reported  by  MNRE  include  non  surplus  capacity;  the  output  of 
electricity  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  therefore  corresponds  to  the  total 
output of electricity. Breaks in time series occur between 2015 and 2016. 
Estimates of solar thermal output up to 2012 may include systems that were out 
of  operation.  For  this  reason,  a  break  in time  series might  occur  between  2012 
and 2013.

Indonesia 
General notes 
Data for Indonesia are available starting in 1971.  
Indonesia joined the IEA as an Association country in November 2015. 
The production and allocation of coal among the various coal types and products 
are estimated by the IEA Secretariat due to data collection limitations. 
The  IEA  Secretariat  estimates  coking  coal  production  for  the  period  from  2014 
onwards. Breaks in time series may appear between 2013 and 2014. From 2011 
onwards,  coal  exports  data  from  BPS  are  used.  This  results  in  breaks  in  time 
series for 2010-2011. 
Indonesia  has  started  operating  blast  furnaces  again  in  2016.  However  no 
information  is  available  to  the  IEA  Secretariat  to  accurately  report  these 
transformation processes; the coal used in blast furnaces is therefore included in 
the iron and steel sector.   
In the 2022 edition, data reported for coal consumption in non-metallic minerals 
industry  might  also  include  coal  consumed  in  the  textile  and  fertilizers  sectors. 
This may create breaks in time series. 
In the 2021 edition, new information on the use of biodiesel was available. This 
allowed the Secretariat to estimate the part blended with diesel and allocate it to 
biodiesel  for  2019.  In  the  time  series  up  to  2018  included,  some  biodiesel 
consumption data could still be included under gas/diesel. This leads to breaks 
in time series between 2018 and 2019. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  was  able  to 
retrieve information to split the electricity generation from biofuels and waste into 
the  different  sources.  This  leads  to  breaks  in  time  series  between  2018  and 
2019. 
In the 2020 edition, new information on coal sales has led to revisions of the coal 
consumption in industry, as well as to coal production, for both other bituminous 
coal and sub-bituminous coal. This leads to breaks in time series between 1999 
and 2000 as well as 2010 and 2011.

In  the  2020  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  integrated  new  information  on  the 
classification of power plants for the year 2018. This might lead to breaks in time 
series between 2017 and 2018.  
Further, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has, for 2018 data and for 
the  first  time,  provided  the  Secretariat  with  estimates  for  Indonesia’s  off-grid 
electricity  production.  This  information  has  been  added  to  the  2018  electricity 
data  and  leads  to  breaks  in  time  series,  foremost  but  not  exclusively  for  solid 
biofuels data.  
In the 2019 edition, the IEA Secretariat came across new information regarding 
the  use  of  coal  in  Indonesia’s  industry  sector.  First  estimates  of  this  use  may 
lead to breaks in time series between 2015 and 2016, as well as between 2016 
and 2017.  
In  the  2018  edition,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  allocated 
power generation from solid biofuels and waste to waste power plants according 
to  new  information  received  from  PLN.  This  leads  to  a  break  in  time  series 
between 2016 and 2017.  
The  data  on  electricity  generation  from  other  vegetal  materials  and  residues 
includes some electricity generation from waste until the year 2016.  
In  the  2015  edition,  data  reported  for  coal  consumption  in  pulp  and  paper 
industry  might  also  include  coal  consumed  in  the  textile  and  fertilizers  sectors. 
This may create breaks in time series. 
Electricity  consumption  for  the  agricultural  sector  is  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat from 2000 onwards. This may lead to breaks in time series between 
1999 and 2000.

Islamic Republic of Iran 
General notes 
Data for the Islamic Republic of Iran are available starting in 1971.  
 Data  are  reported  according  to  the  Iranian  calendar  year.  Data  for  2020 
correspond to 21 March 2020 – 19 March 2021, which is Iranian year 1399. 
Primary oil products (crude oil, NGL and condensates) data are estimated based 
on data from OPEC, JODI.  
Crude  oil  production  and  export  data  do  not  include  field  condensate.  Field 
condensate quantities are included with natural gas liquids. 
Statistical differences in the Islamic Republic of Iran statistics and balances can 
include stock change for some coal and oil products. 
At the time of preparation of the 2022 edition, the official 2020 energy balance of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran was not available. As a consequence, the statistics 
and balances for 2020 have been estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
At the time of preparation of the 2021 edition, the official 2019 energy balance of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran was not available. As a consequence, the statistics 
and  balances  for  2019  have  been  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat,  with  the 
exception of electricity supply and part of electricity demand, which are based on 
official sources. Additionally, 2018 data, which was estimated in the 2020 cycle, 
and  some  2017  flows  have  been  revised  to  incorporate  official  energy  balance 
data  from  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran.  2017  and  2018  NGL  exports  and  stock 
change  estimates  have  also  been  revised,  as  has  2017-2018  primary  solid 
biofuels production and consumption values. 
In  the  2014  cycle,  more  detailed  information  for  the  consumption  of  coke  oven 
coke became available for 2009-2012. Breaks in time series may occur between 
2008 and 2009.

Iraq 
General notes 
Data for Iraq are available starting in 1971.  
Production of paraffin waxes might include other non-specified oil products.  
Crude  oil  production  and  export  data  do  not  include  field  condensate.  Field 
condensate quantities are included in natural gas liquids. 
Crude oil export data include back-blending of fuel oil. 
In  the  2022  edition,  multiple  natural  gas  flows  were  revised  from  2017  to  2019 
based on data published by the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF). 
In the 2022 edition, 2019 electricity production data were revised based on new 
data made available by the Iraq Ministry of Electricity. 
In the 2021 edition, LPG supply and demand flows were reassessed and revised 
from 1993 to 2006. Crude oil refinery input, input/output to/from electricity plants, 
and  transfers,  fuel  oil  own  use  in  refineries,  input  to  electricity  plants,  and 
transfers,  and  non-specified  oil  product  electricity  output  may  be  affected  over 
this period.  
In  the  2021  edition,  gas/diesel  oil  and  fuel  oil  input  to  electricity  plants  (2009-
2018)  were  revised  to  better reflect  information provided  by  the  Iraq  Ministry  of 
Electricity  for  2014-2017  and  Arab  Union  of  Producers,  Transporters  and 
Distributors of Electricity (AUPTDE) for 2009-2013, 2018. Gas/diesel oil imports 
(2011-2018)  were  also  revised  based  on  data  published  by 
the  Joint 
Organisations  Data  Initiative  (JODI).  Reported  consumption  of  gas/diesel  oil 
(2011-2018) and fuel oil/crude oil transfers (2016-2018) were impacted.  
In  the  2021  edition,  production  and  non-energy  use  of  paraffin  wax  and  non-
specified oil products (2017-2018) and crude oil input to electricity plants (2018) 
were revised based on  newly available data from the Iraqi Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative (IEITI). Crude oil and non-specified oil product electricity 
output (2018) were impacted.  
In the 2021 edition, naphtha production and exports (2016-2018) were revised to 
reflect  data  published  by  Organization  of  Arab  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries 
(OAPEC)  and  JODI,  respectively.  Naphtha  and  motor  gasoline  transfers  were 
affected over the same period.

In the 2021 edition, jet kerosene international aviation bunkers and consumption 
for  domestic  aviation  (2010-2018)  were  revised  based  on  information  available 
from OAG Aviation and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 
In  the  2020  edition,  off-grid  solar  photovoltaics  generation  was  added  to  the 
dataset  for  the  years  2013-2018  based  on  International  Renewable  Energy 
Agency (IRENA) estimations. 
In the 2020 edition, the estimation of Iraq’s charcoal production data was revised 
for  1996-2018  to  adjust  the  efficiency  of  the  charcoal  production  process.  This 
revision may lead to breaks in time series between 1995 and 1996. 
In  the  2016  edition,  data  for  electricity  generation  became  available  for  2010-
2013. Breaks in time series may occur between 2009 and 2010. 
Destruction  of  Iraq’s  largest  refinery  occurred  in  2015,  resulting  in  large 
decreases in oil products output in 2015.

Jamaica 
General notes 
Data for Jamaica are available starting in 1971.  
In  the  2022  edition,  electricity  generation  in  natural  gas  main  activity  producer 
plants has been revised from year 2016, according to new information provided 
by the Ministry of Science, Energy and Technology.  
In the 2022 edition, electricity generation in wind and solar PV electricity plants 
has  been  revised  for  years  2016  and  2019,  according  to  new  information 
provided by the Ministry of Science, Energy and Technology. 
In  the  2021  edition,  a  number  of  oil  products’  2018  production  data  has  been 
revised due to the newly published data, and details for domestic aviation have 
been  included  from  2017.  Natural  gas  imports  and  inputs  to  electricity  plants 
have  also  been  revised  across  the  time  series.  The  allocation  of  diesel  to  non-
specified  industries  has  also  been  revised  between  2004  and  2018,  following 
new information from the Ministry of Science, Technology, Energy and Mining of 
Jamaica. 
In  the  2021  edition,  there  is  a  break  in  the  time  series  for  solid  biofuels  as 
Jamaica  has  revised  their  published  2019  consumption  estimates  for  these 
products based on a 2014 study. There are also series breaks for consumption 
allocations  between  2018  and  2019  for  all  fuels  due  to  revision  of  industry 
classifications by Jamaica. 
In the 2020 edition, the IEA Secretariat revised its estimations of the time series 
of  bagasse,  using  information  from  the  Latin  American  Energy  Organization 
(OLADE), 
the  Jamaica  Sugar 
Industry  Authority,  and 
the 
International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) data on capacity and electricity generation. 
As a result, electricity generation and inputs to power of bagasse are significantly 
lower than in previous editions. 
In the 2020 edition, fuel oil and diesel data between 1971 and 1989, as well as 
electricity  generation  between  1971  and  1999  were  also  revised  based  on 
revisions 
from  OLADE.  Naphtha  data  was 
revised 
to 
resolve  past 
inconsistencies. 
In the 2019 edition, the IEA incorporated revisions of 2016 data from the Ministry 
of  Science,  Technology,  Energy  and  Mining  of  Jamaica.  Major  impact  is  the

addition  of  natural  gas  to  the  energy  mix  of  the  country  that  has  retrofitted  its 
power plants and started to import liquefied natural gas.  
In the 2019 edition, a revision of the electricity balance for the years 2011-2017 
was implemented by the IEA to take into account more official data; it can lead to 
breaks in time series in the electricity consumption data between 2010 and 2011, 
as well as 2013 and 2014.  
In  the  2018  edition,  information  became  available  on  charcoal  and  wood 
production. This may lead to breaks in time series between 1989 and 1990 data. 
In the 2016 edition, information became available on industrial consumption of oil 
products  and  electricity.  This  may  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series  between  2007 
and 2008 data. 
Jamaica  changed  their  reporting  methodology  for  final  energy  consumption 
starting  with  2014  data.  This  leads  to  breaks  in  time  series  between  2013  and 
2014.  
Electricity consumption of the residential sector might include small commercial 
customers.

Jordan 
General notes 
Data for Jordan are available starting in 1971.  
In the 2022 edition, electricity demand data for 2020 have been estimated from 
Ministry of Energy information.  
In the 2022 edition, some 2019 data for natural gas and primary and secondary 
oil  have  been  revised  due  to  new  available  information  from  the  Ministry  of 
Energy.  
At the time of preparation of the 2021 edition, 2019 official data for natural gas, 
primary  and  secondary  oil  products,  coal  and  biofuels  have  been  not  available 
yet. Therefore, 2019 figures are entirely estimated by the IEA Secretariat based 
on  available  secondary  sources  or,  when  other  sources  were  not  available, 
based on economic developments. 
In the 2020 edition, solid biofuels in 2016 and 2017 were revised based on newly 
available  information.  This  leads  to  a  break  in  time  series  between  2015  and 
2016. 
In the 2020 edition, data across multiple products were revised based on newly 
available information: namely, non-bio jet kerosene (from 2012), other kerosene, 
motor gasoline and gas/diesel (from 2016), fuel oil (from 2014), and natural gas 
(from 2007). 
In  the  2018  edition,  revisions  in  commercial  and  public  services  electricity 
consumption lead to break in time series between 1992 and 1993. 
Due  to  an  attack  on  a  major  natural  gas  pipeline  between  Egypt  and  Jordan 
during  the  2011  revolution  in  Egypt,  Jordan  relied  much  more  on  fuel  oil  and 
diesel for power generation between 2011 and 2014. 
Jordan started importing coal products in 2012.

Kazakhstan 
General notes 
Data  for  Kazakhstan  are  available  starting  in  1990.  Prior  to  that,  they  are 
included in Former Soviet Union. 
Kazakhstan is one of the 11 EU4Energy focus countries. 
In  the  2022  edition,  data  on  final  consumption  of  oil  products  in  the  domestic 
aviation sector is not available for 2020. Furthermore, data on final consumption 
of natural gas in the residential sector in 2019 was revised by the Committee on 
Statistics of Kazakhstan. 
In the 2020 edition, in the framework of the EU4Energy project, a methodological 
review was conducted by the IEA Secretariat in cooperation with the Committee 
on  Statistics  of  Kazakhstan. This review  led  to  revisions  and  to  a  break in  time 
series between 2013 and 2014, in particular for coking coal, lignite, primary solid 
biofuels  and  electricity.  Domestic  production  of  biodiesel,  jet  gas  and  other 
kerosene was revised to zero. In future cycles, revisions to historical time series 
can  be  anticipated.  The  IEA  Secretariat  is  working  with  the  Committee  on 
Statistics of Kazakhstan on the data collection forms to identify the origin of the 
large statistical differences observed in the national official energy data. 
In  the  2016  edition,  the  Committee  on  Statistics  of  Kazakhstan  introduced 
changes in the forms used to collect energy data to align more closely with the 
International Recommendations for Energy Statistics. In order to reduce burden 
on  enterprises,  questions  on  supply  were  removed  and  supply  data  are  now 
taken  from  administrative  sources.  As  a  consequence,  breaks  in  time  series 
appear for many product and flows, both for supply and demand between 2014 
and 2015 data.  
From  2012  onwards,  as  a  result  of  important  work  carried  out  jointly  by  the 
Committee on Statistics and the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, 
the 
IEA  Secretariat  was  able 
to  switch 
to 
the  Joint 
IEA/Eurostat/UNECE questionnaires as a primary source for Kazakhstan’s data. 
Breaks in time series appear between 2011 and 2012 as a result of this change. 
Some data for fuel inputs to CHP plants are estimated by the IEA Secretariat.  
Kazakhstan’s  coal  data  are  normally  not  disaggregated  by  coal  type.  The 
disaggregation presented in the IEA energy balances is achieved by considering

the typical end uses for different types of coals. This may lead to large statistical 
differences for some types of coal. 
Other  bituminous  and  coking  coal  production  data  includes  not  marketable 
production. 
In  2010,  Kazakhstan  became  a  member  of  a  Customs  Union  with  Russia  and 
Belarus. Breaks in trade time series appear from 2009 to 2012 as the Customs 
shifted from one accounting system to another. 
Natural  gas  production  excludes  re-injection  but,  due  to  data  limitations,  may 
include gas vented or flared. As a consequence, the data for natural gas use in 
oil and gas extraction may also include these amounts. 
In  order  to  be  consistent  with  the  Customs  Union  agreements  between  Russia 
and  Kazakhstan,  natural  gas  production  and  exports  data  include  raw  gas 
production  from  the  Karachaganak  field  (not  marketable  gas  as  per  IEA 
definition). 
Natural  gas  trade  data  have  been  revised  by  Kazakhstan  leading  to  large 
statistical differences for 2012 and 2013.  
Revisions  in  aviation  gasoline  cause  breaks  in  time  series  between  2014  and 
2015.

Kenya  
General notes 
Data for Kenya are available starting in 1971.  
Kenya  is  one  of  the ten countries  that  benefit from  EU  Support to IEA  Data for 
Affordable and Sustainable Energy System for Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Stock changes for lubricants may include informal trade. 
Solar photovoltaic data comes from the International Renewable Energy Agency 
(IRENA) estimations of the off-grid generation up to 2018. 
In  the  2022  edition,  electricity  data  were  revised  from  2003  to  2019  to  be 
reported  on  a  calendar  year  basis.  In  previous  editions,  electricity  data  were 
reported on a fiscal year basis, beginning on 1 July and ending on 30 June of the 
subsequent year. 
In the 2022 edition, oil product data were revised to more accurately reflect the 
final consumption by sector reported by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. 
In the 2021 edition, new information became available on the detailed generation 
of  electricity  from  oil  products.  Generation  per  product  is  now  available  from 
2016 onwards.  
In the 2021 edition, new information became available on the food and tobacco 
industry  activity,  leading  to  revisions  of the  estimations for  energy  consumption 
in the sector from 1996 onward. 
In the 2020 edition, refinery data have been revised from 2014 onwards, as the 
national refinery have stopped its activity in 2013.  
In  the  2020  edition,  new  data  regarding  primary  and  secondary  biofuels 
production and consumption became available, leading to breaks in time series 
between 2017 and 2018.  
In  the  2014  edition,  fuelwood  and  other  vegetal  matters  and  residues  are 
estimated based on 2000 data. Charcoal data are derived from the wood input to 
charcoal  production  with  assumed  efficiency  of  33%;  bagasse  production  and 
input to power plants is back-estimated from data on Mumias cogeneration.

Kosovo 
General notes 
Data for Kosovo are available starting in 2000. Between 1990 and 1999, data for 
Kosovo  are  included  in  Serbia.  Prior  to  1990,  they  are  included  in  Former 
Yugoslavia. 
In  2011,  electricity  transit  trade  data  became  available.  As  a  result,  a  break  in 
time series occurs between 2010 and 2011.  
In 2011, a desulphurization unit operated in Kosovo for a few months only. As a 
result,  breaks  in  time  series  occur  in  2011  for  transfer  and  refinery  input  of 
refinery feedstocks as well as transfer and production of kerosene, gas/diesel oil 
and fuel oil. 
A break in time series between 2015 and 2016 may be observed in biofuels and 
waste due to a survey conducted on household consumption.

Kuwait 
General notes 
Data for Kuwait are available starting in 1971.  
Crude  oil  production  and  export  data  do  not  include  field  condensate.  Field 
condensate quantities are included with natural gas liquids. 
Data for crude oil production include 50 per cent of the output of the Neutral Zone 
shared with Saudi Arabia.  
Information  for  the  use  of  ethane  in  the  petrochemical  sector  is  available  from 
2008  onwards.  This  may  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series  for  ethane  and  naphtha 
production  in  the  petrochemical  industry  and  consumption  between  2007  and 
2008. 
Electricity  outputs  from  crude  oil  are  not  separated  from  other  oil  products 
electricity  output.  Electricity  own  use  by  power  plant  prior  to  2015  may  include 
electricity consumption by water desalination plant. 
In the 2021 edition, natural gas production data were revised based on Cedigaz 
data  from  2009  onwards.  Naphtha  exports  data  were  revised  based  on  JODI 
data from 2009 onwards. 
In  the  2021  edition,  following  products  and  flows  were  revised  as  new 
information  became  available  from  the  Kuwait  Institute  for  Scientific  Research: 
electricity losses and final consumption data from 2014 onwards; electricity own 
use  by  power  plant  from  2015  onwards  to  exclude  electricity  consumption  by 
water  desalination  plant;  solar  PV  generation  from  2016  onwards;  and  wind 
generation from 2013 onwards.  
In  the  2020  edition,  complete  official  data  from  Kuwait  about  primary  and 
secondary  oil  for  2018  were  not  obtained  in  time  for  publication.  The  IEA 
Secretariat estimated the data based on secondary sources. 
In  the  2020  edition,  new  data  on fossil fuels’  input  to  electricity  generation  led  to 
revisions of main activity electricity generation by fuel from 2007 onwards.  
In  the  2020  edition,  due  to  newly  available  information,  the  use  of  ethane  in  the 
petrochemical sector was revised from 2014 onwards.

Kyrgyzstan 
General notes 
Data for Kyrgyzstan are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included 
in Former Soviet Union.  
Kyrgyzstan is one of the 11 EU4Energy focus countries. 
From  2013  onwards,  the  main  data  sources  for  Kyrgyzstan  are  the  annual 
IEA/Eurostat/UNECE  joint  questionnaires  sent  by  the  National  Statistical 
Committee of Kyrgyzstan. 
Several missing data points are estimated by the IEA Secretariat. The crude oil 
input  to  refineries  is  estimated  based  on  the  refinery  output.  The  output  of 
electricity  and  heat  production  from  combustible  fuels  is  estimated  based  on 
previous years’ efficiencies.  
 Motor gasoline and Gas/diesel consumption reported in other sectors than road 
might include road transport.  
In  the  2014  edition,  time  series  data  for  electricity,  oil  products,  and  coal 
products  for  2005  to  2011  were  revised  based  on  newly  available  information. 
This may lead to breaks in the time series for some products.

Lao People’s Democratic Republic 
General notes 
The  IEA  Secretariat  added  the  Lao  People’s  Democratic  Republic  energy  data 
from  2000  onwards  in  the  2020  edition.  Before  2000,  data  are  included  in  the 
“Other non-OECD Asia” region.  
Breaks  in  coal  time  series  in  2014-2015  reflect  the  start  in  operations  of  the 
lignite mine-mouth Hongsa Power Plant. While operation started in 2015, the last 
unit started operation in the first quarter of 2016.

Lebanon  
General notes 
Data for Lebanon are available starting in 1971.  
In  the  2022  edition,  many  data  on  the  electricity  sector  and  oil  products  supply 
for  2020,  usually  provided  by  the  Central  Administration  of  Statistics,  were  not 
available. Thus, the IEA Secretariat estimated those 2020 statistics based on the 
available information. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  use  of  landfill  biogas  for  electricity  generation  in  the 
landfill  of  Naameh  is  included  for  the  first  time.  Data  from  the  Central 
Administration of Statistics shows that operations started during 2018.  
In  addition,  wood  imports  from  1999  to  2016  have  been  revised  to  take  into 
account  new  information  available  from  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organisation 
(FAO). 
In  the  2020  edition,  electricity  production,  losses  and  final  consumption  from 
2012  onwards  were  revised  due 
to  new 
information 
from 
the  Central 
Administration of Statistics.  
In  the  2020  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  revised  the  electricity  generated  from 
diesel and fuel oil by main activity producers, from 1998 and from 2010 onwards 
respectively. 
In  the  2020  edition,  solar  photovoltaics  and  wind  electricity  generation  was 
estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on  International  Renewable  Energy 
Agency (IRENA) data.  
In the 2020 edition, charcoal time series were revised for the period 1992-2003, 
due to new information from FAO. 
In the 2020 edition, the IEA Secretariat estimated 2017 and 2018 wood imports 
based on FAO imports data. 
A significant share of electricity generated in Lebanon is produced using private 
generators. The  corresponding  electricity  outputs  and  inputs  were  estimated  by 
the IEA Secretariat based on Association Libanaise pour la Maîtrise de l’Energie 
et  l’Environnement  (ALMEE)  figures  until  2014  and  expert  analysis  for  2015  to 
2018.

Libya  
General notes 
Data for Libya are available starting in 1971.  
Crude  oil  production  and  export  data  do  not  include  field  condensate.  Field 
condensate quantities are included with natural gas liquids. 
In 
the  2022  edition,  data  on  natural  gas  production  (2005-2014)  and 
consumption (2005-2019) were updated based on revisions from Cedigaz (2005-
2014) and the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) (2016-2019). 
In the 2021 edition, energy industry own use and consumption flows for natural 
gas  were  revised  from  2010-2018  to  reflect  newly  accessed  data  published  by 
the GECF.  
Also in the 2021 edition, non-energy use of naphtha was revised from 2011-2018 
to reflect information on petrochemical production published by the Central Bank 
of  Libya  (CBL)  and  the  National  Oil  Corporation.  These  revisions  resulted  in 
changes  to  naphtha  transfers,  NGL  transfers,  and  NGL  production  over  the 
same period. 
In the 2021 edition, non-energy use of lubricants was revised from 2010-2011 to 
match  data  reported  by  CBL.  Following  years  (2012-2018)  were  estimated  to 
grow with the national economy. Lubricants imports were revised to reflect these 
changes in consumption. 
Also  in  the  2021  edition,  updates  to  2018  ICAO  data  led  to  revisions  in  jet 
kerosene exports, international aviation bunkers, and domestic aviation for 2018. 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  started  estimating  the  charcoal 
production and consumption based on Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) 
data. This led to revisions and breaks in time series between 2001 and 2002.  
In  the  2020  edition,  the  OPEC  revised  other  kerosene  production  and 
importation data up to 1995.  
In  the  2020  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  revised  its  estimation  methodology  for 
natural gas production; data were revised up to 2014.  
In the 2019 edition, the IEA Secretariat started estimating domestic aviation. This 
led to revisions and breaks in time series between 2004 and 2005.

Due to lack of official country data, oil products trade and solid biofuels data are 
estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat.  Data  for  natural  gas  inputs  to  electricity  are 
unavailable from 2015 to 2018. 
Non-technical  losses  and  data  uncertainty  result  in  break  in  time  series  for 
electricity losses and statistical differences between 2011 and 2012.  
Due to information on oil and electricity becoming available from 2006, breaks in 
time series may occur between 2005 and 2006.

Madagascar 
General notes 
Madagascar data are available starting in 1971. 
Significant amounts of coal are imported and consumed in Ambatovy mine, one 
of the  world’s  largest  lateritic  nickel  mines. This has  a  significant  impact on  the 
energy supply requirements of Madagascar.  
At the time of preparation of the 2022 edition, the official energy balance for year 
2020 was not made available to the IEA Secretariat by the Ministère de l'Énergie 
et  des  hydrocarbures.  Therefore,  most  2020  data  have  been  estimated  by  the 
IEA Secretariat. 
At  the  time  of  publication  of  the  2021  edition,  complete  data  were  available  for 
2019, but not for 2018. Supply and demand of solid biofuels as well as demand 
and stock changes of oil products, are estimated by the IEA Secretariat for 2018. 
Small quantities of anthracite imports could be included in other bituminous coal 
from 2011 onwards. 
Oil demand fell significantly in 2002 due to the political and social situation at the 
time.  
The only refinery in Madagascar ceased its activities in 2004.

Malaysia  
General notes 
Data for Malaysia are available starting in 1971.  
For  natural  gas  production  from  the  Joint-Development  Areas  (JDA)  with 
Thailand  and  with  Indonesia,  Malaysia  reports  only  the  production  that 
corresponds to Malaysia. The rest is reported as imports. For the JDA with Viet 
Nam, the production reported includes all the gas produced.  
LPG data may include ethane. Kerosene type jet fuel data may include aviation 
gasoline. Other bituminous coal data may include other coal products. 
In the 2022 edition, 2020 official energy balances from the Energy Commission 
were not available in time for publication. Most flows were therefore estimated by 
the IEA Secretariat. 
In the 2021 edition, 2019 official energy balances from the Energy Commission 
were not available in time for publication. Most flows were therefore estimated by 
the IEA Secretariat based, where relevant, on International Trade Centre data, or 
on GDP and population developments. 
In  the  2021  edition,  naphtha,  lubricants,  bitumen,  paraffin  wax  and  petroleum 
coke  data  from  2007  to  2009  were  aggregated  as  other  non-specified  oil 
products. 
In the 2020 edition, other vegetal material and residue flows from 1971 to 2008 
were  revised.  Natural  gas  use  in  non-specified  transformation  from  2005 
onwards was revised as new information became available. Natural gas own use 
by  liquefaction/regasification  plants  for  2017  was  estimated  due  to  the  lack  of 
information. 
In  the  2019  edition,  the  whole  time  series  of  solid  biofuels  were  revised  in 
response to the request raised by Energy Commission of Malaysia.  
In  the  2012  edition,  new  information  on  the  solid  biofuels  final  consumption 
became  available.  This  may  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series  between  2008  and 
2009. 
Detailed information on oil products such as naphtha, petroleum coke, lubricants, 
bitumen  and  paraffin  waxes  is  only  available  from  2007  to  2009.  From  2010

onwards,  these  quantities  are  presented  in  aggregate  form  under  the  category 
other non-specified oil products. 
From 2009 onwards, electricity generation from co-generators, small renewable 
power producers and self-generators is available. As a consequence, breaks in 
time series may appear for electricity between 2008 and 2009.

Malta 
General notes 
Data for Malta are available starting in 1971.  
In the 2022 edition, gross electricity generation from Solar PV autoproducers and 
several  data  points  in  electricity  final  consumption  were  revised  for  the  years 
2018 and 2019, using new data provided by the National Statistics Office. 
In  the  2020  edition,  biodiesel  use  was  reclassified  by  the  Central  Office  of 
Statistics as transformation from 2016 onwards. This may lead to breaks in time 
series  of  transport,  industry  and  other  sector  final  consumption  between  2015 
and 2016. 
In  the  2020  edition,  for  several  oil  products,  the  final  consumption  in  transport, 
industry  and  commerce,  services  and  other  sectors  was  also  revised,  for  the 
period 2013-2016. 
In  2017,  Malta  imported  LNG  for  the  first  time.  It  is  used  in  power  generation 
engines that have been upgraded to operate on natural gas, from heavy fuel oil 
previously.  2015  and  2016  data  reflects  this  transition  with  high  imports  of 
electricity via the interconnector with Italy. 
In  the  2019  edition,  oil  products  consumption  data  have  been  revised  following 
the results of a fuel survey conducted by the country in 2018. 
In  2017,  Malta  carried  out  a  household  energy  survey  which  led  to  revisions  of 
the  solar  thermal  data  series  for  2010-2016.  This  may  lead  to  breaks  in  time 
series between 2009 and 2010. 
In 2011, a new power generation station fuelled by biogas became operational in 
Malta. This may lead to breaks in time series for some products and flows.

Moldova 
General notes 
Data for Moldova are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included in 
Former Soviet Union.  
Moldova is one of the 11 EU4Energy focus countries. 
Official  figures  on  natural  gas  imports,  natural  gas  inputs  to  power  plants, 
electricity  production,  foreign  trade  and  consumption  are  modified  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat  to  include  estimates  for  supply  and  demand  for  the  districts  from  the 
left  side  of  the  river  Nistru  and  municipality  Bender.  Other  energy  production  or 
consumption from these districts is not included in the Moldovan data. This may 
lead to breaks in the time series for some products. 
In the 2022 edition, 2019 and 2020 natural gas imports data was estimated due 
to data confidentiality. 
Due to the inclusion of estimated data in the Moldova energy balance, indicators 
for  per  capita  energy  consumption  or  energy  intensity  may  appear  inconsistent 
with expected trends. 
The National Bureau of Statistics has revised time series when possible to align 
with  International  Recommendations  for  Energy  Statistics.  As  a  consequence, 
breaks  in  time  series  may  occur  in  1993  for  heat,  in  2012  for  aviation  bunkers 
and  in  2005  for  other  products.  More  survey  data  on  solid  biofuels,  including 
wood,  animal  waste  and  other  plant  residues  are  available  since  2010.  As  a 
consequence, breaks in time series may occur in 2010 for primary solid biofuels.

Mongolia 
General notes 
Data for Mongolia are available starting in 1985. Prior to 1985, they are included 
in the “Other non OECD Asia” aggregate. 
In  the  2022  edition,  disaggregated  2020  coal  balance  table  comprising  of  hard 
coal  and  brown  coal  data  is  provided  by  National  Statistics  Office  of  Mongolia. 
This  led  to  the  breaks  in  time  series  between  2019  and  2020  for  coking  coal, 
bituminous coal and lignite. 
In  the  2021  edition,  2017  and  2018  electricity  generation  from  hydro,  wind  and 
solar PV were revised as new data from Ministry of Energy became available.   
In  the  2018  edition,  data for renewable  electricity  production  became  available. 
This might create breaks in time series between 2002 and 2003.  
In  the  2015  edition,  data  allowing  a  disaggregation  of  coal  by  type  became 
available. In addition, time series were revised from 2005 forward. Breaks in time 
series between 2004 and 2005 may result.

Montenegro  
General notes 
Data  for  Montenegro  are  available  starting  in  2005.  Between  1990  and  2004, 
they  are  included  in  Serbia.  Prior  to  1990,  they  are  included  in  Former 
Yugoslavia. 
In the 2022 edition, 2020 electricity trade data include transit of electricity, which 
was  not  considered  for  previous  years.  This  led  to  breaks  in  the  time  series  of 
imports and exports of electricity between 2019 and 2020.  
In the 2021 edition, lignite calorific values from 2016 to 2018 were revised due to 
new information becoming available. 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  whole  time  series  of  solid  biofuel  transformation  were 
revised due to new information becoming available.  
Charcoal  imports  data  might  include  minor  quantities  of  charcoal  produced 
domestically until the year 2017.  
Breaks in time series appearing in solid biofuels between 2010 and 2011 can be 
explained by a new survey carried out by Montenegro in 2013. 
A  survey  on  energy  consumption  in  industry  was  conducted  by  Montenegro  in 
2014. Breaks in time series may therefore occur between 2004 and 2005.

Morocco  
General notes 
Data for Morocco are available starting in 1971.  
Morocco joined the IEA as an Association country in November 2016. 
Morocco started filling the five Joint IEA/Eurostat/UNECE questionnaires for the 
year 2015. This may lead to breaks in time series between 2014 and 2015. 
In the 2022 edition, revisions were made to disaggregate autoproducer electricity 
production from main activity electricity production for wind (2013-2019) and fuel 
oil electricity only plants (2019). Breaks in time series may occur. 
In  the  2019  edition,  revisions  in  solar  thermal  electricity  production  were  made 
for 2015 and 2016. This may lead to breaks in time series.  
In  the  2018  edition,  revisions  in  biofuels  were  made  for  the  period  2004-2014. 
This may lead to breaks in time series between 2003 and 2004. 
In  the  2018  edition,  revisions  in  autoproducer  electricity  from  combustible  fuels 
and  electricity  production  from  heat  from  chemical  sources  were  made  and  a 
break in time series may be observed between 2012 and 2013. 
The  Samir-Mohammedia 
refinery  expansion  was  completed 
in  2009, 
accommodating new feedstocks and additives. This may lead to breaks in time 
series between 2009 and 2010. 
In August 2015, refinery activity stopped, causing significant decreases in refined 
oil products production and breaks in time series between 2014, 2015, and 2016.

Mozambique  
General notes 
Data for Mozambique are available starting in 1971.  
The Mozal aluminium smelter opened in 2000, leading to significant changes in 
trends of electricity demand.  
In  the  2022  edition,  new  information  from  the  Ministry  of  Energy  became 
available 
to 
the 
IEA  regarding  Kerosene-type  Jet  Fuel  consumption 
in 
Mozambique, leading to revisions of the time series between 2011 and 2019 for 
International Aviation Bunkers and Domestic Aviation consumption.  
In the 2021 edition, the Ministry of Energy revised its energy balances for 2011 – 
2018, leading to revisions of all products and flows. Breaks in time series might 
occur  between  2010  and  2011.  Data  on  bitumen  importation  and  consumption, 
bagasse production and electricity generation from bagasse were added for the 
first time. 
In the 2020 edition, petroleum coke data is included from 2000 onwards. Due to 
the opening of a new pit in Moatize mine, breaks in time series may happen for 
coal between 2016 and 2017.

Myanmar  
General notes 
Data for Myanmar are available starting in 1971.  
Data from the Myanmar Central Statistical Organisation are reported on a fiscal 
year basis, beginning on 1 April and ending on 31 March of the subsequent year. 
At  the  time  of  preparation  of  the  2022  edition,  the  official  annual  data  for  2020 
were  not  complete.  As  a  consequence,  Myanmar’s  2020  energy  balance  was 
estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on  Myanmar  Statistical  Information 
Service and a variety of secondary sources. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  revised  2018  figures  for  indigenous 
production of natural gas and 2017 and 2018 data for hydroelectricity due to new 
information available from Myanmar Central Statistical Organisation. 
In the 2021 edition, use of renewable municipal waste in main activity producer 
electricity  in  2017  and  2018  and,  consequently,  electricity  generation  was 
revised by the IEA Secretariat based on data from the International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA).  In the 2019 edition, a detailed breakdown by coal type 
data,  renewable  data  and  some  oil  products  data  became  available  from  2016 
onwards. This might result in breaks in time series between 2015 and 2016.  
In  the  2018  edition,  demand  data  for  all  energy  products  and  coal  trade  data 
became  available  for  2016.  This  might  result  in  breaks  in  time  series  between 
2015 and 2016.

Namibia 
General notes 
Data for Namibia are available starting in 1991. Prior to that, data are included in 
the Other Africa region. 
NamPower data are published on a fiscal year basis spanning from 1st of July Y-
1 to 30th of June Y. Data for 2020 coming from NamPower correspond to 1st July 
2019 to 30th June 2020 This can explain inconsistencies between data sources.  
In  the  2022  edition,  solar  PV  (2018-2019)  and  solid  biofuels  (2019)  data  were 
revised  based  on  new  data  made  available  by  the  International  Renewable 
Energy  Agency  (IRENA)  and  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organisation  (FAO), 
respectively. 
Electricity  final  consumption  data  allocated  to  non-specified  other  sectors  may 
contain residential consumption of electricity. 
In the  2020  edition, fuelwood  production, fuelwood  input  to  charcoal  production 
and  charcoal  production  were  revised  from  1991  onwards  based  on  Food  and 
Agriculture Organisation (FAO) data.  
In the 2020 edition, other vegetal matters and residues production and use were 
revised from 2013 onwards based on population growth. 
In the 2020 edition, LPG use was revised from 1996 onwards based on national 
data  on  sales  and  economic  growth,  while  imports  were  revised  from  2016 
onwards based on the United Nations Comtrade database. 
In the 2018 edition, charcoal exports were revised from 2000 onwards based on 
FAO data. This may create break in time series between 1999 and 2000.

Nepal 
General notes 
Data for Nepal are available starting in 1971.  
Data are reported by Nepal on a fiscal year basis. Data for 2020 correspond to 
1 July 2020 – 30 June 2021.  
In the 2021 edition, due to lack of official country data from Economic Survey by 
Ministry  of  Finance  and  Nepal  Oil  Corporation,  production  and  consumption  of 
coal  and  biofuels,  renewable  electricity  generation  and  consumption  of  oil 
products for 2019 year have been estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
In  the  2021  edition,  trade  of  bitumen  and  bituminous  coal  from  2012  onwards 
were revised based on official customs data.

Nicaragua 
General notes 
Data for Nicaragua are available starting in 1971.  
In the 2021 edition, 2018 data has been revised to include information from the 
Ministerio  de  Energía  y  Minas,  which  was  not  available  at the time  of the  2020 
edition’s publication. This revision affects most energy products and flows.  
In  addition  specific  revisions  have  been  made  to  gasoline  consumption  from 
2003  and  jet  fuel  kerosene  supply  and  consumption  from  2010  to  utilise  the 
ministry’s  energy  balance  information  and  estimates  for  domestic  aviation 
consumption  and  aviation  bunkers  have  been  revised  from  2017.  This  may 
create a break in the time series. 
The 2021 edition also includes new national data on the use of animal waste for 
the production of biogas in anaerobic bio-digesters. This creates a break in the 
time series between 2018 and 2019 for solid biofuels. 
In  the  2020  edition,  data  between  2005  and  2017  were  revised  to  account  for 
energy balance information available from the Ministerio de Energía y Minas. At 
the time of publication, 2018 data were not fully available. For this reason, 2018 
data  published  in  2020  included  estimates  from  the  Latin  American  Energy 
Organization (OLADE).

Niger 
General notes 
Data for  Niger  are  available  starting  in  1971.  Data  prior  to  2000  were  added  in 
the 2021 edition and sourced from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). 
This addition led to breaks in time series between 2000 and 2001, particularly in 
solid  biofuels  time  series.  In  previous  editions,  data  for  this  time  period  were 
included in the “Other Africa” region. 
At the time of preparation of the 2021 edition, no official data were available from 
Niger for 2017 to 2019.  As a consequence, the statistics and balances for these 
years have been created based on available economic indicators from the United 
Nations  Statistics  Division  (UNSD)  and  newly  available  energy  data  from  the 
Système  d'Informations  Energétiques  de  l'Union  Economique  et  Monétaire 
Ouest-Africaine  (SIE-UEMOA).  Data  for  2017  to  2019  have  been  revised  to 
reflect  this  new  source.  Electricity  flows,  diesel  flows,  crude  oil  production,  and 
LPG consumption in electricity plants have also been revised for 2016. 
Natural gas production and consumption in electricity plants for 2018 and 2019 
and  LPG  consumption  in  autoproducer  electricity  plants  for  2010  to  2019  are 
new in the 2021 edition. 
At the time of preparation of the 2021 edition, electricity generation data in GWh 
are  not  available  for  individual  secondary  oil  products.  Consequently,  total 
electricity  generation  from  oil  products  is  reported  under  non-specified  oil 
products  for  all  years.  The  division  of  electricity  generation  by  main  activity 
producers  and  autoproducers  is  also  not  available  for  2016  to  2019  and  has 
been estimated based on 2015 data.  
In the 2019 edition, the IEA secretariat started to estimate domestic aviation. The 
revisions  made  to  integrate  this  information  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series 
between 2000 and 2001.

Nigeria 
General notes 
Data for Nigeria are available starting in 1971.  
Nigeria is one of the ten countries that benefit from EU Support to IEA Data for 
Affordable and Sustainable Energy System for Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Crude oil production and export data may include field condensate. 
Statistical differences may include stocks and unofficial trade flows.  
Inputs of motor gasoline and gas/diesel to back-up electricity generation, as well 
as  the  associated  electricity  outputs,  which  may  be  substantial  in  Nigeria,  may 
not be properly reported. 
In the 2022 edition, electricity output from hydro (2015, 2018-2019) and solar PV 
(2013-2015)  was  updated  to  align  with  revisions  to  data  provided  by  the 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).  
In the 2022 edition, gas/diesel oil consumption in the road transport sector was 
re-estimated from 2018 to 2019 based on sectoral GDP growth reported by the 
Central Bank of Nigeria.  
In  the  2022  edition,  fuel  oil,  bitumen,  and  non-specified  oil  products  production 
was revised for 2019 based on data from the Joint Organisations Data Initiative 
(JODI).  Consequently,  non-specified  oil  products  imports  and  transfers  and 
refinery feedstocks transfers and transformation were revised for 2019 based on 
IEA  Secretariat  estimates  and  data  from  the  Nigerian  National  Petroleum 
Corporation. 
In  the  2019  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  started  to  estimate  domestic  aviation. 
The  revisions  made  to  integrate  this  information  led  to  breaks  in  time  series 
between 2009 and 2010. 
In the 2018 edition, new information became available through the department of 
Petroleum Resources. Breaks in time series can be observed between 2009 and 
2010 for motor gasoline, jet kerosene, diesel, and fuel oil; and between 2013 and 
2014 for lubricants. Electricity losses have been fixed at 15% starting from 2007. 
In  the  2017  edition,  new  information  became  available  through  the  Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation for natural gas liquids. Break in time series can 
be observed between 2012 and 2013.

In  the  2017  edition,  naphtha  data  were  added.  Breaks  in  time  series  can  be 
observed in other oil products and naphtha in 2003 and 2015. 
In  the  2015  edition,  new  information  became  available  indicating  that  on-grid 
power generation has been fuelled by natural gas for many years. This may lead 
to breaks in time series between 1996 and 1997.

Republic of North Macedonia 
General notes 
Data  for  North  Macedonia  are  available  starting  in  1990.  Prior  to  that,  they  are 
included in Former Yugoslavia. 
North  Macedonia  changed  the  methodology  for  reporting  autoproducer  heat 
consumption  for  own  use  in  2010,  which  can  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series 
between 2009 and 2010. 
The refinery OKTA in North Macedonia was shut down in 2014. This may lead to 
breaks in time series between 2013 and 2014. 
The  State  Statistical  Office  revised  the  energy  balances  from  2005  to  2014  in 
accordance  with 
the  survey  conducted 
in  2014  on  household  energy 
consumption.

Oman 
General notes 
Data for Oman are available starting in 1971.  
The  interconnected  nature  of  the  Mina-Al-Fahal  and  Suhar  oil  refineries  is 
reflected in the fuel oil data, leading to breaks in time series for some products 
between 2007 and 2008. 
The 2021 edition includes revisions to crude oil refinery input in 2018, revisions 
to  gasoline  imports  for  2018,  revisions  to  kerosene  residential  consumption 
across  the  time  series  and  revisions  to  jet  fuel  kerosene  allocation  between 
international aviation bunkers and domestic aviation from 2009 onwards, in order 
to reflect new information available and improved estimates. In the 2020 edition, 
solar  photovoltaic  production  was  included  from  2013  onwards,  based  on 
capacity data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). 
In the 2014 edition, data on electricity from the Authority for Electricity Regulation 
became  available;  as  a  result,  breaks  in  time  series  between  2004  and  2005 
may be observed. 
In 2006, the Suhar Refinery came online. Breaks in time series may be observed 
in oil products between 2005 and 2006.

Pakistan 
General notes 
Data for Pakistan are available starting in 1971.  
Data are reported on a fiscal year basis. Data for year Y represent the fiscal year 
that goes from 1st of July year Y to 30th of June year Y+1. 
As  Pakistan  publishes  oil  products  stock  changes  at  an  aggregated  level,  the 
IEA Secretariat estimates detailed stock changes by product. 
Own use of electricity by industries with autoproducer electricity plants may not 
be captured. 
For  bitumen  and  lubricants,  data  for  stock  variations  may  include  unreported 
trade or consumption. 
At  the  time  of  preparation  of  the  2022  edition,  2020  official  data  for  Pakistan 
were  not  available  yet.  2020  data  are  therefore  entirely  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat based on available secondary sources.  
In the 2021 edition, the 2018 figures of electricity, non-combustible renewables, 
primary  and  secondary  oil  products,  natural  gas  and  coal  products  have  been 
revised due to 2018 Energy Yearbook of Pakistan being available. 
In the 2019 edition, various improvements were made in the following areas: oil 
refineries  own  use  of  all  products  has  been  split  more  accurately  between  fuel 
oil,  LPG  and  refinery  gas  to  take  into  account  official  data  (2010-2016);  official 
information  on  LPG  stock  changes  has  been  introduced  (2010-2016);  LPG 
consumption in other non-specified sector has been revised to take into account 
official  data  (2001-2016);  motor  gasoline  data  has  been  revised  to  include 
production  and  imports  of  HOBC  (High  Octane  Blending  Component)  as  per 
official  information  (1996-2016);  and  imports  of  LNG  have  been  taken  into 
account based on official information (2014-2016).  
In  the  2009  edition,  time  series  data  for  natural  gas  for  the  years  2004-2007 
were revised due to the inclusion of the North-West Frontier Province data (now 
called KPK) and Pakistan Steel Mills. Breaks in time series may occur between 
2003 and 2004.

Panama  
General notes 
Data for Panama are available starting in 1971.  
International aviation bunkers figures for jet kerosene may include exports. 
Import figures for diesel and residual fuel oil are calculated by excluding bunker 
use. 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  revised  fuel  oil  and  diesel  imports  and 
international  marine  bunkers  data  for  2018  and  2019  due  to  newly  available 
information from Autoridad Marítima de Panamá. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  revised  electricity  generation  from  oil 
products  from  2010  onwards.  This  can  lead  to  a  break  in  time  series  between 
2009 and 2010.  
In  the  2021  edition,  the  final  consumption  of  diesel  in  agriculture  and  forestry 
was  reclassified  as  fishing  due  to  newly  available  information  from  the 
Compendio Estadístico Energético. 
In the 2020 edition, the IEA Secretariat revised Panama data from 2010 onwards 
based  on  the  national  energy  balances  from  the  Ministry  of  Economics  and 
Finance.  This  might  affect  electricity  trade  and  losses,  motor  gasoline  stock 
changes  and  road  consumption,  fuel  oil  imports  and  international  marine 
bunkers, bituminous coal imports and inputs to main activity producer electricity 
plants. 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  final  consumption  of  motor  gasoline  in  agriculture  and 
forestry  was  reclassified  as  fishing  due  to  newly  available  information  from  the 
Compendio Estadístico Energético. 
In  the  2020  edition,  LPG  imports,  exports,  stock  changes,  final  consumption  in 
non-specified 
industry, 
in  non-specified 
transport  and 
in  residential  and 
commercial  and  public  services  from  2010  onwards  were  revised  due  to  newly 
available data. 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  reported  use  of  coal  in  autoproducers 
electricity plants as a new plant within the mining sector, Minera Panamá, started 
its operations in 2018.

In the 2020 edition, due to the beginning of commercial operations of the Costa 
Norte  plant  on  1st  of  September  2018, the  IEA Secretariat  reported  natural  gas 
imports, use by main activity producers and corresponding electricity generation 
in  2018,  based  on  available  information  from  the  Compendio  Estadístico 
Energético. 
In  the  2019  edition,  time  series  for  fuelwood  data  were  revised  based  on  data 
from the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE). Break in time series can 
be observed between 1999 and 2000.  
From 2003 onwards, there has been no domestic production of oil products due 
to refinery closure.

Paraguay 
General notes 
Data for Paraguay are available starting in 1971.  
The Itaipu  hydroelectric plant,  operating  since  1984  and  located  on the Paraná 
River  (which  forms  the  border  of  Brazil  and  Paraguay)  was  formed  as  a  joint 
venture between Eletrobrás and the Paraguayan government.  
In the 2021 edition, revisions to 2018 kerosene and jet kerosene data have been 
made.  In  addition,  2006-2009  data  has  been  revised  to  reflect  revisions  on 
national  energy  balances.  These  have  led  to  changes  to  charcoal,  gasoline, 
diesel, fuel oil and ethanol flows. The 2021 edition also revises electricity data to 
include small imports of electricity in 2005 and 2006. 
In  the  2020  edition,  2015  data  on  coal  and  fuel  wood  were  revised,  as  well  as 
2013 data on electricity demand and 2012 data on diesel oil, due to revision of 
national  energy  balances.  Data  was  revised  for  lubricants  from  2003,  bitumen 
from 1994 and petroleum coke between 2013 and 2015 due to new information 
from Banco Central del Paraguay. This may lead to break in time series. 
Paraguay’s  cement  industry  underwent  a  fuel  switch  from  fuel  oil  to  petroleum 
coke. The consequent increase in petroleum coke imports and use is reflected in 
the data. In the 2020 edition, imports data for 2014 and 2015 were revised based 
on new trade information.  
In the 2020 edition, new information on the industrial consumption of solid fuels 
led  to  a  reallocation  of  industrial  consumption  of  charcoal  and  anthracite  to  the 
iron and steel industry. Paraguay is continuing to developing its statistical system 
further and additional data and sectoral disaggregation is likely to be available in 
the  future  and  taken  into  account  in  future  editions.  At  present,  there  is  no 
available information on the capacity and generation of solar and wind power.  
In  the  2019  edition,  wood  data  was  revised  for  2016  due  to  a  revision  of  the 
wood  density  used  by  the  source.  This  led  to  a  break  in  time  series  between 
2015 and 2016. 
In  the  2019  edition,  new  information  became  available  on  the  split  between 
international  and  domestic  use  of  jet  kerosene  from  2005  onwards.  The 
consequent  data  revision  may  lead  in  break  in  time  series  between  2004  and 
2005.

In 2015, Paraguay surveyed the charcoal production plants. The results allowed 
to  correct  the  efficiency  of  the  process  down  to  49%.  This  change  is 
implemented  in  the  data  from  2015  onwards  and  leads  to  a  break  in  the  time 
series of wood input to charcoal production plants. 
From  2006  onwards,  there  has  been  no  output  of  oil  products,  due  to  refinery 
closure.

Peru 
General notes 
Data for Peru are available starting in 1971.  
The 2021 edition includes revisions to coke oven coke from 2012, to reclassify a 
proportion  of  this  as  petroleum  coke  in  line  with  ministry  published  data.  There 
are  also  revisions  to  diesel  stock  changes  from  2016  and  non-specified  oil 
production  and  NGL  transfers  from  2010,  to  incorporate  additional  information 
reported in the Balance Nacional de Energía.  
In the 2020 edition, marine bunkers data for 2017 and 2018 is now reported by 
the  Ministerio  de  Energía  y  Minas,  as  well  as  2018  aviation  bunkers.  Electricity 
generation  data  is  revised  from  2016  to  incorporate  additional  information  from 
the  Anuario  Estadístico  de  Electricidad.  NGL  data  was  revised  from  2004. 
Following  information  from  national  energy  balances,  transfers  have  been 
revised  and  refinery  feedstocks  data  became  available  from  2012  onwards. 
Breaks in time series may occur between 2011 and 2012. 
Liquid biofuels are included in the energy balances from 2010 onwards.  
Between 2015 and 2016, there is a break in time series due to a restructuring of 
energy balance for demand side of energy products. 
In  the  2019  edition,  an  allocation  between  domestic  and  international  aviation 
consumption of jet kerosene was estimated by the IEA Secretariat since 2010 and 
up to 2017. This may lead break in time series between 2009 and 2010.  
In the 2018 edition, crude oil and NGL figures were revised for the years 2004-
2015  due  to  change  of  the  methodology.  This  may  lead  to  different  trends 
compared to previous editions of this publication.

Philippines 
General notes 
Data for the Philippines are available starting in 1971.  
In the  2021  edition,  electricity  consumption  data for  industry  (1990-2011,  2016-
2018),  commercial  and  public  services,  agriculture  and  fishing  sector  (1990-
2007)  were  revised  as  new  information  from  the  Ministry  of  Energy  became 
available.  Similarly,  solid  biofuels  including  fuelwood,  bagasse,  charcoal  (1971-
2018)  and  animal  waste  (1990-2009),  as  well  as  liquid  biofuels  including 
biogasoline and biodiesel (2005-2009, 2015, 2017) and municipal waste (2009) 
were  revised  as  new  information  from  Asia  Pacific  Energy  Research  Centre 
(APERC) became available. 
In  the  2021  edition,  other  bituminous  coal  and  sub-bituminous  coal  data  from 
1990  onwards  for  supply  side  and  input  to  power  plants  flow  were  revised  as 
Ministry  of  Energy  confirmed  that  only  sub-bituminous  coal  is  produced,  traded 
and consumed in the Philippines. 
In the 2020 edition, electricity final consumption was revised from 2016 onwards 
due to new information provided by the Department of Energy. 
In the 2018 edition, data for 2012-2016 for bagasse has been revised. This may 
lead to breaks in time series between 2011 and 2012.

Qatar 
General notes 
Data for Qatar are available starting in 1971.  
Crude oil production and export data do not include field condensates.  
Natural  gas  liquids  (NGL)  include  field  condensates,  propane,  butane  and 
ethane  production  from  natural  gas  processing  plants.  NGL  produced  from 
liquefied  natural  gas  production  plants  and  gas-to-liquids  plants  may  be 
excluded. 
Propane  and  butane  from  natural  gas  processing  plants  are  transferred  to 
liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG).  Ethane  from  natural  gas  processing  plants  is 
transferred to ethane. 
Information  on  the  use  of  LPG  and  ethane  in  the  petrochemical  sector  is  from 
2005 onward. This may lead to breaks in time series for these products between 
2004 and 2005. 
In  2010,  a  new  ethane  cracker  began  operations  in  Ras  Laffan,  Qatar,  with 
production capacity of 1.3 million tonnes per year. Breaks in time series in LPG 
and ethane production can be seen between 2009 and 2010. 
Electricity  production  from  autoproducers  includes  generation  by  desalination 
plants  since  1988.  Own  use  of  electricity  includes  use  by  desalination  plants 
since  a  breakdown  is  not  available.  Electricity  consumption  in  industry  includes 
electricity consumption by the energy sector. 
Three  satellite  power  stations  located  outside  of  Doha  are  included  as  main 
electricity producers up to 2014. In 2015, these power stations are not reported 
and are likely included as part of RAF-A station as auto production.  
At the time of preparation of the 2022 edition, several of the usual sources were 
not  available  and  2020  oil  and  gas  data  were  often  estimated  based  on 
economic  developments.  OAPEC  data  was  mainly  used  for  oil  products 
production. 
In the  2022  edition,  NGL  transfers to  Ethane  and  Ethane non-energy  use  were 
revised  for  the  period  2011-2019,  as  new  information  from  ethylene  production 
plants became available to the IEA Secretariat.

Romania 
General notes 
Data for Romania are available starting in 1971.  
Romania’s  methodology  for  estimating  indigenous  production  of  geothermal 
energy differs from the one that IEA has adopted. Therefore, data comparisons 
between Romania and other countries might be misleading. 
Data on quantities of coke oven coke used in blast furnaces do not correspond 
to  the  official  submission  of  the  national  administration,  as  they  have  been 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat to ensure a carbon balance in the blast furnace 
transformation.  
In the 2021 edition, net calorific values (NCVs) reported by Romania were used 
to convert physical data to energy units. In previous years, IEA standard NCVs 
were used. As a result, the time series of primary and secondary oil products in 
energy  units  were  revised  for  varying  periods  between  1990  and  2018. 
Furthermore,  the  NCVs  for  coal  products  have  been  aligned  to  the  reported 
ones,  leading  to  revisions  especially  for  the  coal  data  in  energy  units  used  in 
power plants.

World energy balances 2022 Edition 
 
Russian Federation  
General notes 
Data for the Russian Federation are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they 
are included in Former Soviet Union.  
For  2020,  all  data  have  been  estimated  by  the  IEA Secretariat  based  on 
preliminary  supply  side  data  submitted  during  the  2020/21  cycle,  the  2020 
energy balances published by Rossstat, and other publically available sources. 
Similarly, the 2021p data have been estimated by the IEA Secretariat based on 
official publically available sources. 
For  data  prior 
to  2020,  annual  statistics  are  based  on  annual 
joint 
IEA/Eurostat/UNECE  questionnaires  submissions  received  from  Rosstat,  the 
official  data  provider  to  the  IEA.  Data  may  differ  from  secondary  sources,  and 
discrepancies are being investigated. 
In 2007, the Federal State Statistics Service introduced a new classification, the 
Russian  Classification  of  Economic  Activities  (OKVED),  oriented  towards 
harmonization  with  the  Statistical  Classification  of  Economic  Activities  in  the 
European  Community  (NACE  Rev.1).  Data  for  the  years  prior  to  2005  were 
submitted  to  the  IEA  Secretariat  according  to  the  Russian  Classification  of  the 
Industries of the Economy (OKONKH). Therefore, breaks in time series for final 
consumption sectors may occur between 2004 and 2005. 
Coal 
Coal  statistics  provided  by  Rosstat  may  differ  from  those  collected  by 
Rosinformugol.  Blast 
furnace  gas  values  since  2012  utilise  a  different 
methodology  to  that  of  prior  years  (where  heat  from  other  sources  than  blast 
furnace  gas  had  been  attributed  to  blast  furnace  gas).  Some  coal  trade  from 
partners  of  the  Customs  Union  has  been  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  and 
additionally removed from indigenous production where it may be reported in data 
of other organisations. 
Oil  
For  2020,  due  to  data  availability,  sectoral  demand  trends  have  been  kept 
uniform  for  a  given  oil  product.  Furthermore,  stock  changes  for  several  oil 
products have been used as a balancing item or kept zero.

Due to the classification system (Russian Classification of Product by Economic 
Activities)  used  by  the  Russian  administration,  breaks  between  2017  and  2018 
occur in the time series of some products. In particular, there is a break in stocks 
for  other  oil  products  between  2017  and  2018  and  an  absence  of  data  for 
refinery gas, which results in a reduction of total oil consumption in the chemical 
sector and refinery fuel use from 2018 onwards. 
In  the  2019  edition,  naphtha  exports  and  non-energy  consumption  in  the 
chemical and petrochemical sector from 2011 to 2016 have been revised by the 
IEA  Secretariat  based  on  information  provided  by  Rosstat.  Prior  to  2011 
domestic  consumption  of  naphtha  was  calculated  as  residual  in  the  Russian 
balance and is likely to be overestimated. 
Recent refinery upgrade projects have resulted in an increase in the production 
of gasoline and diesel affecting the refinery yield spread in 2017 and onwards.  
Condensate  quantities  reported  by  Rosstat  are  included  under  natural  gas 
liquids (NGL) rather than crude oil.  
Jet  kerosene  output  is  confidential  and  estimated  based  on  historical  refinery 
throughput growth rate. No information on vacuum gas oil is available.  
Jet  kerosene  consumption  split  between  international  and  domestic  aviation  is 
unknown so consumption is equally split between the two flows. 
LPG refinery output may include output from gas separation plants.  
Information on international marine bunkers consumption is submitted from 2010 
with high fluctuation in time series.  
From 2017, data for gas/diesel oil deliveries to international marine bunkers was 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat.  
2018 and 2019 data for non-energy use of LPG and white spirit in the chemical 
and petrochemical sector were estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
2019  data  for  output  and  consumption  of  naphtha  in  the  chemical  sector  were 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
2018 and 2019 data for gas/diesel, fuel oil and white spirit output were estimated 
by the IEA Secretariat. 
2018  and  2019  data for exports  of gas/diesel  oil, fuel  oil  and  other  oil  products 
were estimated by the IEA Secretariat.

2019 data for output of other oil products was estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
Restrictions  on refuelling  of  international  vessels in  Russian  ports  were  lifted  in 
December 2016 as a result consumption of oil products in navigation increased 
in 2017.  
Interproduct  transfers  of  jet  kerosene  to  gas  diesel  oil  represent  quantities 
blended  with  marine  diesel  to  improve  the  cold  flow  properties  of  artic  marine 
diesel. 
Natural gas 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  Russian  Federation  revised  2018  natural  gas  stock 
levels, leading to revised figures for 2018 statistical differences and total energy 
supply. 
In  the  2017  edition,  the  Russian  Federation  revised  natural  gas  data  back  to 
2013. 
From  2009,  all  data  concerning  LNG  trade  and  LNG  production  have  been 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
Oil and gas extraction includes natural gas consumed by oil refineries. 
Biofuels and waste 
Charcoal data are reported with solid biofuels from 2010 to 2014. 
Solid  biofuels  indigenous  production  and  input  to  charcoal  production  plants  are 
estimated by the IEA Secretariat starting in 2015.  
The  geothermal  input  to  main  activity  electricity  plant  was  estimated  by  IEA 
Secretariat for 2013 and 2014. 
Electricity and heat  
For 2020, due to data availability, for a given fuel, the ratio of electricity output by 
plant  type  has  been  held  at  2019  values.  Similarly,  the  efficiencies  of  most 
combustible fuel plants have been kept at 2019 levels.  
In  2017,  the  Russian  administration  transitioned  to  a  new  classification  system 
(the new Russian National Classifier of Types of Economic Activity). As a result, 
some breaks in-series may occur between 2016 and 2017.

Data for electric boilers may include heat pumps, as disaggregated data for heat 
pumps are not collected by Rosstat. 
The  split  between  main  activity  producer  and  autoproducer  plants,  and 
electricity-only  and  CHP-plants  is  as  provided  by  Rosstat.  This  deviates 
significantly from the definitions used by the IEA. 
For  2018,  the  decrease  in  heat  consumption  in  the  Machinery  sector  is  due  to 
reduced economic activity in that sector. 
The decrease in heat output from gas/diesel oil in Autoproducer CHP plants from 
2016 onwards is due to fuel switching to natural gas. 
The 2015 data for electricity and heat show a substantial drop in heat production 
on  autoproducer  plants  fuelled  by  natural  gas.  These  figures  have  been 
confirmed by the Russian authorities. 
The 2013 data for electricity and heat show a substantial drop in the efficiency of 
autoproducer  heat  plants  fuelled  by  natural  gas  as  well  as  a  decrease  in 
production and consumption of heat. These figures have been confirmed by the 
Russian authorities. 
Heat from other sources is produced from recovered waste heat.

Rwanda 
General notes 
Rwanda data are available from 1971 onwards. 
Prior  to  2000,  all  data  are  based  on  the  United  Nations  Statistics  Division  data 
and IEA Secretariat estimates. Breaks in time series appear in UNSD data. 
Trade  of  bituminous  coal  is  based  on  the  United  Nations  trade  data.  Peat 
production  is  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on  Energy  Planning 
Department data.  
In the 2022 edition, Electricity generation, trade and demand data were provided 
by  the  Rwanda  Utilities  Regulatory  Authority  (RURA) for  years  2019  and  2020. 
Electricity generation from regionally shared hydro power plants is now reported 
in Hydro main activity producer electricity plants for years 2019 and 2020, while 
it is reported in Electricity imports until 2018. Data up to 2018 are estimated by 
the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on  UNSD  data  and  data  provided  by  the  Energy 
Planning Department, and have been revised by the IEA Secretariat. 
In the 2022 edition, the IEA Secretariat received the Rwanda Household Survey 
2019/2020  published  by  the  National  Institute  of  Statistics  of  Rwanda  (NISR). 
This  survey  provides  information  on  residential,  commercial  and  industrial 
consumption  of  biofuels  for  year  2020.  Therefore  the  published  2020  data  on 
biofuels demand is based on this source, and the time series has been revised 
according to current information. Biofuels production data is still estimated by the 
IEA Secretariat. 
The  break  observed  in  Charcoal  production  and  Fuelwood  input  to  charcoal 
production plants time series between 1997 and 1998 is due to a break included 
in data from FAO. 
In  the  2022  edition,  Oil  products  trade  and  demand  data  in  Rwanda  for  years 
2019  and  2020  were  provided  by  RURA.  From 2000  to  2009,  oil  products  data 
are mainly extracted from the AFREC database. Between 2010 and 2015, most 
of  oil  data  come from the  Energy  Planning  Department.  More  recent  data  have 
been  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on  population,  economic 
developments or AFREC trends. 
In the 2022 edition, Natural gas data for years 2019 and 2020 are estimated by 
the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on  RURA  data  regarding  electricity  generation  in

Saudi Arabia 
General notes 
Data for Saudi Arabia are available starting in 1971.  
Crude  oil  production  and  export  data  do  not  include  field  condensate.  Field 
condensate quantities are included with natural gas liquids. 
Data  for  crude  oil  production  include  50 per  cent  of  the  output  of  the  Neutral 
Zone,  shared  with  Kuwait.  Similarly,  crude  oil  production  includes  50%  of  the 
output of the Abu Safa field shared with Bahrain.  
Natural gas consumption for oil and gas extraction may include quantities used 
in oil refineries. 
In the 2022 edition, exports and non-energy use data for LPG and naphtha have 
been  revised  from  2000  onwards  due  to  new  available  information.  This  might 
lead to breaks in both the time series between 1999 and 2000. 
In the 2022 edition, bitumen production and imports data were revised from 1995 
onwards to reflect official data more accurately. Similarly, crude oil consumption 
in non-especified industry was revised fom 2017 onwards.  
In  the  2021  edition,  data  on  fuel  oil  input  to  electricity  production  have  been 
revised for 2012-2019 in light of new information on power generation.  
In  the  2020  edition,  data  on  electricity  as  well  as  multiple  products  related  to 
electricity  generation  (natural  gas,  crude  oil,  gas/diesel,  fuel  oil)  were  revised 
from 2012 onwards due to newly available information. This might lead to breaks 
in time series between 2011 and 2012.  
In the 2020 edition, crude oil and gasoline stock changes have been revised due 
to a change in methodology. 
In  the  2020  edition,  new  data  became  available,  modifying  the  estimation  of 
natural  gas  consumption  as  feedstock  in  ammonia  and  methanol  manufacture 
from  2005  onwards.  This  may  lead  to  breaks  in  the  time  series  between  2004 
and 2005.  
In  the  2015  edition,  new  data  became  available,  allowing  the  estimation  of 
natural gas consumption as a feedstock in ammonia and methanol manufacture 
from 1990 to 2013. The remaining natural gas consumption has been allocated

to  the  non-specified  industry  sector.  Breaks  in  time  series  may  occur  between 
1989 and 1990 for this reason. 
Electricity  production  from  autoproducers  includes  generation  by  desalination 
plants since 1979. 
Electricity  end  use  specific  to  the  agriculture  and  forestry  sector  has  not  been 
reported since 2015. 
New Yasref refinery in Yanbu came online in 2015 with 400 kbd refining capacity. 
Breaks in time series for oil industry consumption of oil products and diesel output 
from refineries may be observed between 2014 and 2015.

Senegal 
General notes 
Data for Senegal are available starting in 1971.  
Senegal is one of the ten countries that benefit from EU Support to IEA Data for 
Affordable and Sustainable Energy System for Sub-Saharan Africa. 
In  the  2021  edition,  previously  reported  hydroelectricity  production  was  revised 
as  imports from  2009  onwards,  as  the  dam  is  not  located  within  the  borders  of 
the country.  
In addition, in the 2021 edition, the electricity output was split per oil product from 
2017  onwards  thanks  to  new  information  available.  Thanks  to  improvements  in 
the data collection system, the final consumption of electricity is monitored more 
accurately  in  2019.  This  may  lead  in  breaks  in  time  series  between  2018  and 
2019. 
Finally,  in  the  2021  edition,  quantities  of  diesel  used  to  start  ignite  the  power 
plants were reported for the first time, related to the 2019 diesel consumption. 
In the 2020 edition, data for 2017 have been revised based on new data received 
from the Ministère de l’Energie et des Mines.  
In  the  2018  edition,  data  for  2014  and  2015  are  revised  based  on  information 
received from the Ministère de l’Energie et des Mines. 
In  the  2014  edition,  the  time  series  for  solid  biofuels  were  revised  from  2009 
onwards based on newly available information. Breaks in time series may occur 
between 2008 and 2009.

Serbia 
General notes 
Data for Serbia are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included in 
Former Yugoslavia. 
Serbia  energy  data  include  Montenegro  until  2004  and  Kosovo  until  1999. 
Breaks in time series for oil products and natural gas may appear between 2006 
and 2007 due to newly available data for 2007.  
In the 2022 edition, the Lignite input to Heat Autoproducers and the Lignite own 
use  in  BKB/peat  briquettes  plants  time  series  have  been  revised  from  2014  to 
2019, due to new information provided by the Ministry of Mining and Energy and 
the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia.  
In  the  2022  edition,  the  large  increase  observed  in  Primary  solid  biofuels  final 
consumption  in  the  residential  sector  for  year  2020  is  due  to  a  specific  survey 
carried out under the authority of the Ministry of Mining and Energy, concerning 
only year 2020. This creates a break in-series with historic data.  
In  the  2021  edition,  the  time  series  for  non-bio  diesel  consumption  from  2016, 
lignite  input  into  power  plants  from  2014,  and  inputs  into  blast  furnaces  from 
2017 have been revised due to new information and improved methodologies.

Singapore 
General notes 
Data for Singapore are available starting in 1971.  
Singapore joined the IEA as an Association country in October 2016. 
At the time of publication of the 2022 edition, refinery input and output figures for 
2020  were  not  available  and  they  have  therefore  been  estimated  by  IEA 
Secretariat.  These  values  may  differ  significantly  from  actual  figures  published 
later in Singapore’s official sources. The 2019 refinery input and output became 
available, leading to revisions of the numbers published in the 2021 edition. 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  2006-2019  electricity  road  consumption  data  were 
revised to take into account estimated Electric Vehicle (EV) consumption under 
transport sector. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  2008-2019  exports  data  for  aviation  gasoline  were 
revised as new information became available. 
The  IEA  Secretariat,  the  Energy  Market  Authority  (EMA)  and  the  National 
Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) have worked closely together on improving 
data  quality  for  Singapore.  Therefore,  breaks  in  time  series  between  2008  and 
2009  and  differences  in  trends  when  compared  to  previous  publications  may 
occur for some products. 
From  2009,  Singapore  publishes  splits  of  refinery  output  between  light,  middle 
and heavy distillates and residuum only. Further breakdown between products is 
estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat.  Singapore  aggregates  petrochemical  and 
refinery consumption. The split between refining and petrochemical consumption 
is estimated by the IEA Secretariat. 
Refinery  input  is  broken  down  between  crude  oil  and  feedstocks.  Splits  of 
feedstock  by  product  are  not  provided  by  Singapore.  By  default,  IEA  estimates 
that  feedstocks  come  from  naphtha  as  a  result  of  residual  calculation  plus 
gas/diesel and fuel oil in equal proportions. 
Other  data  remain  aggregated  due  to  lack  of  data  availability.  Electricity 
consumption in the industry sector from 2005 includes electricity consumption by 
refineries. Electricity consumption in transport includes all electricity consumption 
at  airport  terminals.  Municipal  waste  production  and  consumption  may  include 
biogas.

Refinery gas production and consumption may include syngas produced by the 
petrochemical sector. 
Due  to  Singapore’s  large  trade  volume  in  comparison  to  its  final  consumption, 
slight misalignment of trade figures can have a significant impact on the energy 
balance  of  Singapore.  The  IEA  Secretariat  has  adjusted  total  imports  of 
gas/diesel from 2009 onwards to match demand. 
A  coal-fired  power  plant  started  operations  in  2013.  This might  lead  to  breaks  in 
time series between 2012 and 2013.

South Africa 
General notes 
Data for South Africa are available starting in 1971.  
South Africa became an IEA Association country in November 2018. 
Nuclear and Hydro electricity generation data are reported on a fiscal year basis, 
beginning on the 1 April Y and ending on the 31 March Y+1. 
Data may  be  revised from  Y-2 to  Y  to  reflect  the  Y-2  and  Y-1  energy  balances 
published by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy as they become 
available.  
Coal 
Outputs  from  gas-to-liquids  and  coal-to-liquids  plants  are  presented  in  the 
“Transfers” flow. 
Coking  coal,  coke  oven  coke,  coke  oven  gas  and  blast  furnace  gas  production 
and consumption are estimated using reported crude steel production figures. 
For the 2019 edition, the estimation methodology was changed for gas work gas, 
which  may  lead  to  break  in  time  series  between  2009  and  2010.  The  IEA 
Secretariat  uses  the  industrial  activity  data  reported  by  the  World  Steel 
Association to estimate the consumption of the industry sector.  
In  the  2017  edition,  new  information  became  available  which  allowed  the 
separation  of  non-energy  use  of  coal  in  Coal  to  Liquids  (CTL)  plants  from  the 
coal  used  for  energy  purposes  in  these  same  plants.  Non-energy  conversion 
efficiencies  for  CTL  plants  in  South  Africa  are  assumed  to  be  60%  in  physical 
units. Due to specific calorific values used for this specific process, the efficiency 
is  73%  in  our  energy  balance  format.  This  methodology  may  lead  to  breaks  in 
time series between 2010 and 2011 for these products and flows. 
In  the  2013  edition,  breaks  in  time  series  may  occur  for  anthracite  and  coking 
coal  between  2009  and  2010  as  new  information  became  available.  Prior  to 
2010, coking coal data may include anthracite.

Oil 
In the 2021 edition, the 2016-2019 inputs to refineries and outputs of refined oil 
products for were revised to avoid refinery gains in energy terms. This may result 
in high statistical difference for crude oil data. 
In the 2019 edition, new information became available that led to changes in the 
split of kerosene type jet fuel consumption in domestic aviation and international 
bunker. Breaks in time series may occur between 2008 and 2009. 
New information became available in 2015 on refinery output of lubricants. Data 
have  been  revised  from  1998.  This  may  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series  between 
1997  and  1998.  Reported  quantities  of  synthetic  fuels  output  may  not  include 
quantities from PetroSA. 
Natural gas 
In the 2014 edition, new information became available on consumption of natural 
gas  in  industrial  sectors.  Breaks  in  time  series  may  occur  between  2009  and 
2010. 
Biofuels and waste 
In  the  2022  edition, the time  series  of  charcoal and  primary  solid  biofuels  were 
revised starting in 2000 to include import and export data from FAO. Production, 
transformation, and consumption estimates were revised accordingly. Breaks in 
time series may occur between 1999 and 2000. 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  estimation  methodology  of  bagasse  and  other  vegetal 
materials and residues (primary solid biofuels) was changed to utilize data from 
the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, FAO, and IRENA. Breaks in 
time series may occur between 1998 and 1999. 
In the 2020 edition, the estimation methodology was changed for solid biofuels, 
which  may  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series  between  2002  and  2003.  The  IEA 
Secretariat methodology is now based on the results of a study lead by Statistics 
South Africa on the residential consumptions of fuels.  
In  the  2019  edition,  bagasse  consumption  in  CHP  plants  was  reported  for  the 
first  time  by  the  Department  of  Energy.  Data  may  include  coal  co-burnt  with 
bagasse.

South Sudan 
General notes 
Data for South Sudan are available from 2012. Prior to 2012, they are included 
in Sudan. 
In the 2022 and 2021 editions, the IEA Secretariat did not receive data related to 
2020  or  2019  at  the  time  of  the  publication;  supply,  transformation  and  use  of 
energy have been estimated by the IEA Secretariat for 2020 and 2019. 
In the 2022 edition, multiple products and flows were revised for 2018 based on 
new data provided by the African Energy Commission (AFREC). 
In  the  2021  edition,  revisions  to  source  data  from  2016-2018  have  resulted  in 
changes  to  several  products,  including  crude  oil,  solar  PV,  electricity,  LPG, 
gas/diesel oil, and jet kerosene. 
In the 2018 edition, revisions in 2015 data are due to new information available 
through the AFREC questionnaire.  
Crude  oil  production  and  exports  were  halted  for  most  of  2012,  and  only 
continued in April 2013. Both production and exports have been estimated by the 
IEA Secretariat for 2014.

Former Soviet Union 
General notes 
Data  for  the  Former  Soviet  Union  (FSU)  are  available  starting  in  1971  up  to 
1989.  
Data for individual countries of the FSU are available starting in 1990, and most 
of  the  information  related  to  years  1990  and  1991  was  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat.  Because  of  large  breaks  in  reporting  occurring  in  the  early  1990’s, 
breaks in time series may occur in 1990 for all regional totals.  
Coal  production  statistics  refer  to  unwashed  and  unscreened  coal  up  to  1990. 
IEA  coal  statistics  normally  refer  to  coal  after  washing  and  screening  for  the 
removal of inorganic matter. Also, see notes under “Classification of Fuel Uses” 
and “Heat”, in section on Notes on data quality. 
The  commodity  balances  presented  for  the  FSU  include  IEA  Secretariat 
estimates  of  fuel  consumption  in  the  main  categories  of  transformation.  These 
estimates  are  based  on  secondary  sources  and  on  isolated  references  in  FSU 
literature. 
In older editions of this publication, intra-FSU trade was excluded.

Sri Lanka 
General notes 
Data for Sri Lanka are available starting in 1971.  
Refinery losses may include own use of refinery fuel. 
Breaks in time series may occur between 1999 and 2000 due to newly available 
energy balances provided by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority in 2009. 
Stock  changes  may  include  statistical  difference  for  several  secondary  oil 
products until 2017. 
In  the  2022  edition,  data  from  2011  onwards  were  revised  as  new  information 
became available from Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority. 
In  the  2021  edition,  final  consumption  data  for  fuelwood  in  residential  and 
commercial and public services was estimated by the IEA Secretariat.

Sudan 
General notes 
Data  for  Sudan  are  available  starting  in  1971.  South  Sudan  became  an 
independent country on 9 July 2011. From 2012 onwards, data for South Sudan 
are  reported  separately  and  therefore,  breaks  in  the  Sudan  time  series  may 
occur between 2011 and 2012. 
The IEA Secretariat could not obtain official balances from Sudan for data after 
2012.  In  the  2022  edition,  data  from  the  Joint  Organisations  Data  Initiative 
(JODI)  Oil  World  database  replaced  oil  product  estimates  when  available  for 
2013 to 2018. After 2018, most of the oil products data are estimated based on 
Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) data, while some 
flows such as  kerosene consumption and diesel exports and bunkers have been 
estimated based on macroeconomic indicators.  
Up  to  2018,  most  of  the  electricity  data  are  estimated  based  on  Arab  Union  of 
Producers,  Transporters  and  Distributors  of  Electricity  (AUPTDE)  data,  when 
available. As of the time of publication of the 2022 edition, AUPTDE data are not 
available  after  2018.  Therefore,  2019  and  2020  electricity  consumption  data 
have  been  estimated  based  on    macroeconomic  indicators,  while  electricity 
production  and  trade  data  were  retrieved  from  the  Africa  Energy  Portal  and 
Central Bank of Sudan, respectively. 
In  the  2021  edition,  2018  jet  kerosene  flows  were  revised  to  reflect  data  made 
available  by  OAG.  Breaks  in  time  series  may  occur  between  2017/2018. 
Revisions were also made to lubricants consumption (1999-2005). 
In the 2019 edition, due to revisions in the OAPEC data for oil products, breaks 
in time series might occurs from 2014 onward.  
In  the  2016  edition,  new  information  on  refinery  activity  became  available. 
Breaks in time series for oil products can be seen between 2015 and 2016.  
In  the  2015  edition,  the  Kosti  power  plant  began  operation  in  Sudan,  with 
500 MW capacity. The plant uses crude oil for fuel, and break in time series can 
be seen for crude oil imports and input into main activity power plants in 2015.

Suriname 
General notes 
Data  for  Suriname  are  available  starting  in  2000.  Prior  to  2000,  data  for 
Suriname are included in the “Other non-OECD Americas” region. 
In the 2021 edition, new information became available on crude oil refinery input 
and  transfers,  which  led  to  revisions  to  these  flows  from  2016  onwards.  There 
have  also  been  revisions  to  both  gasoline  and  diesel  consumption  flows  from 
2016 onwards to utilise new information. These changes may result in breaks in 
the time series. 
In  the  2020  edition,  new  information  became  available  on  electricity  generation 
and  consumption,  as  well  as  trade  of  oil  products.  This  leads  to  revisions  in 
electricity generation since 2011, electricity consumption since 2013 and trade of 
oil  products  since  2010.  Breaks  in  time  series  may  therefore  occur  in  the  time 
series. 
In  the  2019  edition,  new  information  became  available  on  the  expansion  of  the 
refinery  at  Tout  Lui  Faut  and  the  resulting  increase  in  diesel  and  gasoline 
production. The IEA Secretariat consequently revised 2015 and 2016 data. The 
change of data sources may cause break in time series and increased statistical 
difference. 
The  production  of  aluminium  in  Suriname  stopped  in  2015.  However,  this  does 
not  lead  to  a  significant  drop  in  electricity  consumption  in  the  industrial  sector 
due  to  the  opening  of  a  new  gold  mine.  The  gold  mining  sector  consumes  a 
significant amount of the electricity produced in Suriname.  
The electricity output from Afobaka dam is included in autoproducer generation 
up to 2015 and in main activity from 2016 onwards, reflecting that it is no longer 
related to another economic activity.

Syrian Arab Republic 
General notes 
Data for the Syrian Arab Republic are available starting in 1971.  
Imports of crude oil and secondary oil products may include informal imports. 
Due  to  the  on-going conflict  in  Syria,  no  official  government  data  sources  were 
available since 2012.  
In  the  2021  edition  and  2022  edition,  data  are  primarily  based  on  secondary 
sources, media reports and IEA Secretariat estimates. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  import  of  crude  oil  as  well  as  production  and  trade  of 
LPG,  motor  gasoline,  naphtha,  jet  fuel,  kerosene,  diesel,  fuel  oil  and  non-
specified  oil  products  for  2018  were  revised  using  newly  available  information 
from OAPEC. 
In  the  2021  edition,  electricity  distribution  losses  from  2009  onwards  and  final 
consumption from 2011 onwards were revised due to a methodological change. 
In the 2021 edition, fuelwood and charcoal data from 1971 onwards were revised 
using FAO data. This leads to break in time series between 1997 and 1998. 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  final  consumption  of  LPG,  motor  gasoline,  naphtha,  jet 
fuel,  kerosene,  diesel,  fuel  oil  and  non-specified  oil  products  in  2016  and  2017 
was revised due to new information from OAPEC. 
In  the  2019  edition,  oil  products  consumption  was  revised  from  2013  onwards 
based on information from OAPEC.

Chinese Taipei 
General notes 
Data for Chinese Taipei are available starting in 1971.  
Refinery gains observed across the time series are due to the fact that backflows 
of  LPG,  fuel  oil  and  motor  gasoline  are  not  accurately  reported.  The  Bureau  of 
Energy,  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  asked  the  IEA  Secretariate  to  reflect  the 
data  as  it  is  currently  reported  until  it  is  able  to  align  its  reporting  with 
international recommendations. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  integrated  revisions  submitted  by  the 
Bureau  of  Energy,  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs,  for  1982-2018.  The  revisions 
affect all products and years, as well as calorific values and densities. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  continued  working  with  the  Bureau  of 
Energy,  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs,  to  align  methodologies  and  conversion 
factors.  As  a  consequence,  the  reporting  of  additives  for  the  whole  time  series 
was revised.  
In  the  2021  edition,  the  Bureau  of  Energy,  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  also 
reported  for  the  first  time  use  of  coke  oven  gas  in  the  chemical  and 
petrochemical sector. Their work on coke oven gas also resulted in a revision of 
is calorific values between 2005 and 2018. 
In  the  2020  edition,  data  for  the  period  2005-2017  were  modified  based  on 
revisions  by  the  Bureau  of  Energy,  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs.  This  leads  to 
breaks  in  time  series  between  2004  and  2005,  specifically  in  the  power  sector 
where  the  split  between  autoproducers  and  main  activity  producer  plants  was 
made  available.  Revisions  also  affect  crude  oil  input  and  additives  in  order  to 
reflect the refinery sector more accurately. 
In  the  2018  edition,  data  were  revised  for  the  period  2002-2015  based  on  new 
balances  submitted  by  the  Bureau  of  Energy  and  changes  in  methodology. 
Breaks in time series might occur. Breaks in time series may also occur between 
2010  and  2011  as  more  detailed  information  became  available  for  refinery 
feedstocks and oil products. 
In  the  2012  edition,  data  for  the  period  1982-2009  were  revised  based  on  new 
balances  submitted  by  the  Bureau  of  Energy.  Breaks  in  time  series  may  occur 
between 1981 and 1982.

Tajikistan  
General notes 
Data for Tajikistan are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included 
in Former Soviet Union.  
Tajikistan is one of the 11 EU4Energy focus countries. 
In the 2022 edition, due to new information received by the statistics office, crude 
oil  production,  bitumen  imports  and  electricity  generation  by  main  activity 
producer CHP plants using natural gas were revised for 2019 as well as the net 
calorific value of other bituminous coal for all flows from 2016 onwards.  
In  the  2020  and  2021  edition,  a  portion  of  crude  oil  imports  and  crude  oil 
production, respectively, were estimated by the IEA Secretariat to avoid refinery 
gains.  This  may  lead  to  breaks  in  the  time  series  between  2017  and  2018  and 
between 2018 and 2019. 
In  the  2019  edition,  new  information  on  coal  products  became  available  to  the 
statistics  office  for  2016.  This  may  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series  between  2015 
and 2016. 
In  the  2018  edition  data  for  2015  has  been  revised  to  accommodate  new 
information received from the statistics office. 
In  the  2016  edition,  breaks  in  time  series  occur  between  2011  and  2012  and 
between 2013 and 2014, as new information became available from the statistics 
office.

Tanzania 
General notes 
Data for Tanzania are available starting in 1971.  
LPG  data  are  reported  on  a  fiscal  year  basis  starting  in  2012.  Data  for  2020 
correspond to 1 July 2020 – 30 June 2021. 
In  the  2022  edition,  motor  gasoline  data  were  revised  from  2011-2019  to  align 
with  the  calendar  year  based  on  monthly  import  data  published  by  the  Energy 
and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA).  
In  the  2021  edition,  new  information  available  led  to  revision  of  historical  time 
series for solid biofuels. 
In  the  2019  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  came  across  new  information  on  the 
shares of international and domestic aviation in Tanzania. The revisions made to 
integrate this information led to breaks in time series between 2009 and 2010.

Thailand 
General notes 
Data for Thailand are available starting in 1971.  
Thailand joined the IEA as an Association country in November 2015. 
Data for lubricants, refinery gas and non-specified oil products are not published 
by the Ministry of Energy and are estimated by the IEA Secretariat. Up to 2012 
data, IEA Secretariat also estimated naphtha. 
Data  for  production,  own  use  and  non-energy  use  of  natural  gas  may  include 
propane, butane and ethane produced in gas separation plants.  
Stock changes may include statistical difference for certain products. 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  revised  the  methodology  for  reporting 
LPG  output 
from 
the  condensate  splitter  and 
the  corresponding 
field 
condensates input. As a result, crude oil input to petrochemical plants between 
2013 and 2019 has been deleted, while input to oil refineries has been revised. 
This also led to the removal of the time series on refinery feedstock production 
from other sources – oil products and transfers between 1996 and 2019, which 
also affected naphtha and LPG production figures between 1996 and 2019 and 
2008 and 2019, respectively.  
In the 2022 edition, NGL non-energy use in 2013 and 2014 was revised due to 
new available information. 
In the 2021 edition, natural gas consumption in the industry sector was revised 
to reflect official data more accurately. 
In  the  2021  electricity  generation  data  for  hydropower,  fuel  oil  and  other 
bituminous  coal  plants  were  revised  to  take  into  account  new  information 
available on the split between main activity and autoproducer plants. 
Naphtha production data from 2018 onwards, motor gasoline for 2019 and 2020 
and  gas/diesel  oil  for  2018  and  2020  were  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  to 
avoid refinery gains. 
In the 2021 edition in an effort to report the consumption of aviation fuels more 
accurately  across  the  time  series,  the  IEA  Secretariat  estimated  the  split 
between international and domestic aviation consumption prior to 2006

In  the  2020  edition,  motor  gasoline,  other  kerosene  and  fuel  oil  total  final 
consumption  as  well  as  gas/diesel  oil  used  in  transformation  processes  were 
revised to reflect official data more accurately. 
In the  2020  edition,  natural gas flows  between  2014  and  2017  were  revised  as 
new  information  on  its  consumption  in  the  industry  sector  became  available. 
Electricity consumption in the rail sector between 2014 and 2017 was revised as 
new information became available. Primary solid biofuel flows between 1989 and 
1994 were revised as new information became available. 
In  the  2014  edition,  information  became  available  for  the  consumption  of 
anthracite and lignite coal in industry. Breaks in time series may occur between 
2011 and 2012.

Togo 
General notes 
Data for Togo are available starting in 1971.  
In the 2022 edition, where possible 2019 data have been substituted with official 
data from SIE-UEMOA energy statistics. 
At  the  time  of  preparation  of  the  2021  edition,  2019  official  data  for  Togo  were 
not  available  yet.  2019  data  are  therefore  entirely  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat based on available secondary sources or, when other sources were 
not available, based on economic developments. 
In the 2021 edition, newly available information led to the reporting of half of the 
hydroelectricity generation of Togo as exported to Benin, for the first time in 2019 
data. 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  accessed  official  data  for  the  2013-2018 
period.  Natural  gas  imports  and  use  in  electricity  generation  are  reported  for  the 
first time by Togo from 2014 onwards.  
In the 2020 edition, solar photovoltaic off grid production was estimated by the IEA 
Secretariat based on International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) capacities 
from 2013 to 2018.  
In the 2014 edition, Togo submitted official data for the years 2009-2012. Breaks 
in time series between 2008 and 2009 may occur for this reason.

Trinidad and Tobago 
General notes 
Data for Trinidad and Tobago are available starting in 1971.  
Trinidad and Tobago’s only refinery closed in 2018.  
Data  for  refinery  gas  production  include  losses  inside  the  refinery  up  until  the 
year 1999.  
In  the  2022  edition,  part  of  the  final  consumption  data  of  oil  products  for  year 
2019  has  been  revised  to  use  directly  official  data  from  the  Ministry  of  Energy 
and  Energy  Affairs.  In  cases  where  this  has  not  been  possible,  2019  data  is 
estimated based on the total final consumption data by product available and the 
split into sectors from 2018.  
In  the  2021  edition,  electricity  data  for  2014  to  2017  was  revised  as  new 
information  from  the  Latin  American  Energy  Organization  (OLADE)  became 
available.  Similarly,  trade  of  oil  products  has  been  revised  for  2014,  2016  and 
2018.  
In  the  2019  edition,  new  information  became  available  from  the  Ministry  of 
Energy and Energy Affairs in order to disaggregate the losses from the refinery 
gas production for 2000-2017. 
In  the  2014  edition,  natural  gas  time  series  from  2000  were  revised  based  on 
newly available information on the definition of production of natural gas used by 
Trinidad and Tobago (gross versus marketed production).

Tunisia 
General notes 
Data for Tunisia are available starting in 1971.  
In the 2021 edition, net calorific values (NCVs) reported by Tunisia were used to 
convert  physical  data  to  energy  units.  In  previous  years,  IEA  standard  NCVs 
were used. As a result, the time series of primary and secondary oil products in 
energy units were revised for varying periods between 1990 and 2018. 
In  the  2015  edition,  new  information  for  lubricants  and  bitumen  became 
available. This may lead to breaks in the time series between 2009 and 2010. 
A  significant  increase  in  crude  oil  production  was  reported  for  2007  due  to  the 
start-up of several new development wells and the beginning of production of the 
Oudna field.  
A  shutdown  of  the  Bizerte  refinery  occurred  between  March  2010  and  June 
2011, resulting in breaks in time series for crude oil and oil products for the years 
2009 to 2011. 
In the 2009 edition, new data on charcoal production became available. A break 
in  time  series  for  wood  inputs  and  charcoal  outputs  can  be  observed  between 
2008 and 2009. 
Revisions in heat data between 2013 and 2014 from the 2017 edition are based 
on a survey of autoproducers.

Turkmenistan 
General notes 
Data  for  Turkmenistan  are  available  starting  in  1990.  Prior  to  that,  they  are 
included in Former Soviet Union. 
Turkmenistan is one of the 11 EU4Energy focus countries. 
Very  little  data  from  Turkmenistan  are  currently  available.  Supply  data  are 
available from secondary sources and consumption is estimated. To indicate the 
lack of data, certain figures for the period 2015-2020 have deliberately been kept 
equal to the previous year’s figures. This is the case of the use of natural gas in 
transformation  and  final  consumption,  input  of  crude  oil  to  refineries,  trade  and 
output  of  secondary  oil products from refineries,  electricity  and  heat commodity 
balances. 
In  the  2022  edition,  natural  gas  exports  and  consumption  data  from  2011 
onwards have been revised according to newly available information. 
In the 2022 edition, in an effort to report the consumption of jet kerosene more 
accurately  and  thanks  to  new  information  available,  the  IEA  Secretariat 
estimated  the  split  between  international  and  domestic  aviation  from  2016 
onwards. 
In  the  2021  edition,  natural  gas  indigenous  production  and  exports  data  from 
2001  to  2007  (excluding  2004)  have  been revised  according  to  newly  available 
information.  This  also  impacts  the  estimation  of  natural  gas  liquids  production 
and liquefied petroleum gases final consumption for the period 2001-2003. 
In the 2021 edition, information became available on the operations of a new gas-
to-liquids  plant. Its  output  is  reported  in  other  hydrocarbons  and  then transferred 
to the corresponding secondary oil products.

Uganda 
General notes 
Uganda data are available from 1971 onwards. 
In  the  2022  edition,  more  detailed  information  on  fuel  consumption  by  industry 
sub-sector was provided by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development for 
2020.  For  electricity  and  primary  solid  biofuels,  all  industry  consumption  is 
allocated  to  non-specified  industry  consumption up  to  2020.  It  is  disaggregated 
into  specific  sub-sectors  in  2020,  creating  a  break  in  the  time  series  between 
2019  and  2020.  For  charcoal,  liquefied  petroleum  gases,  motor  gasoline,  other 
kerosene,  and  gas/diesel  oil,  industry  consumption  was  re-allocated  from  non-
specified industry to the sub-sector identified in the new 2020 data for the whole 
time series. 
In the 2021 edition, new data became available to the IEA secretariat, leading to 
revisions  of  the  whole  time  series  for  solid  biofuels  (fuelwood,  bagasse  and 
charcoal). 
Also  in  the  2021  edition,  new  data  available  lead  to revision  of  the oil  products 
from 2000 onward, and the addition of bitumen to the products for the whole time 
series. Electricity data were also revised for the whole time series.  
In  the  2020  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  estimated  2007  –  2018  data  based  on 
AFREC and IRENA data. 
In  the  2020  edition,  the  Secretariat  estimated  the  share  of  domestic  and 
international  aviation  consumption  based  on  OAG  data  from  2005  onwards; 
breaks in time series might occurs between 2004 and 2005.  
Prior to 2007, data are based on the United Nations Statistics Division data and 
IEA Secretariat estimates.

Ukraine 
General notes 
Data for Ukraine are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included in 
Former Soviet Union. 
Ukraine is one of the 11 EU4Energy focus countries. 
Due  to  limited  information  being  available  to  the  State  Statistics  Service  of 
Ukraine from part of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine and from the 
Autonomous Republic of Crimea, breaks in the time series occur after 2013 for 
coal products and in 2016, for diesel energy industry own use.   
The  IEA  Secretariat  and  the  State  Statistics  Service  of  Ukraine  have  worked 
closely  on  the  revision  of  historical  data.  Therefore,  breaks  in  time  series  may 
occur between 2006 and 2007. 
From  2007  onwards  the  transparency  of  data  may  be  reduced  because  of 
confidentiality  issues.  For  instance:  peat  includes  lignite  and  patent  fuel;  other 
kerosene  includes  aviation  fuels  (aviation  gasoline,  gasoline-type  jet  fuel  and 
kerosene-type  jet  fuel)  for  the  period  2007-2015;  other  products  include 
petroleum  coke;  since  2016  aviation  fuels  and  kerosene  are  included  in  other 
products; since 2017 bituminous coal includes anthracite. 
Coal 
IEA  statistics  refer  to  coal  after  washing  and  screening  for  the  removal  of 
inorganic  matter.  Official  Ukrainian  coal  statistics  refer  to  unwashed  and 
unscreened coal prior to 1995.  
The  decline  in  coal  production  observed  since  2013  is  the  reflection  of  lack  of 
data availability in these regions, not of an actual decrease in coal production. 
In  the  2022  edition  and  for  the  year  2020,  coking  coal  production  has  been 
reclassified  as  other  bituminous  coal  production  due  to  the  lower  quality  of  the 
extracted coal. This creates a break in the time series of indigenous production 
between 2019 and 2020 for both coal products.  
Anthracite supply and demand data since 2017 are included in other bituminous 
coal due to confidentiality issues. 
Bituminous coal from other sources refers to coal mined in informal sector.

Due to a plant closure in 2008, a stock of lignite/peat became available, without 
details  about  its  consumption.  This  may  lead  to  breaks  in  time  series  and  high 
statistical difference for 2008.  
Since  2013,  quantities  of  other  bituminous  coal  reported  under  patent  fuel 
transformation are used to make briquettes from dust and due to confidentiality 
and calorific value of this output, it is reported in peat products and not in patent 
fuel production.  
Oil 
From  the  2020  edition,  the  Statistics  Service  of  Ukraine  is  encountering 
confidentiality  issues  that  lead  to  lack  of  refinery  output  data  availability.  Since 
2018 data, the resulting large refinery losses reflect the missing output data. Part 
of  the  production  of  Ukraine’s  refinery  is  included  with  “other  non-specified  oil 
products”, more specifically all motor gasoline produced in 2018, and part of this 
production  in  2019.  Because  of  this,  in  the  2022  edition  the  IEA  Secretariat 
decided to report motor gasoline and gas/diesel oil production from 2018 to 2020 
as confidential.  
Large  statistical  differences  exist  for  some  oil  products  such  as  transport  fuels 
and  LPG.  These  are  due  to  identified  reporting  issues  in  Ukraine.  The  State 
Statistics Service of Ukraine continues to work with data providers to solve these 
issues. 
Due  to  lack  of  disaggregated  data,  aviation  fuels  are  included  with  “Other  non-
specified oil products”.  
In  the  2017  edition,  refinery  inputs  have  been  estimated  for  2015  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat  based  on  supply  to  correct  the  disbalance  between  inputs  and 
outputs; discrepancies may appear in the 2015 refinery balance.  
In the 2016 edition, refinery gas is reported in the transformation sector. A break 
in time series and statistical difference appear as more information on the supply 
side remains unavailable. 
Quantities  of  other  hydrocarbons  reported  correspond  to  petroleum  coke 
produced from coal tar. This information is not available for 2016.

Natural gas 
The data for the stock draw and statistical difference of natural gas in 2010 are a 
consequence  of  the  accounting method  chosen by  the  Ukrainian  administration 
to reflect the ruling of the Stockholm Arbitration Tribunal of March 30, 2010.  
Gas stocks include stocks supplied to the Autonomous republic of Crimea. 
Due  to  the  new  annual  survey  form,  there  was  reclassification  between  main 
activity producers and autoproducers in 2016. 
Biofuels and waste 
Charcoal production has included pyrolysis and calculated amounts of traditional 
production since 2008. 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  Statistics  Service  of  Ukraine  reported  supply  and 
demand of industrial waste from several sources for the first time.  
Electricity and heat 
Statistical  difference 
for  electricity 
includes  electricity  supplied 
to 
the 
Autonomous  Republic  of  Crimea  and  the  Donetsk  and  Luhansk  regions  of 
Ukraine.  
In 
the  2016  edition,  power  plants  have  been  reclassified  due 
to 
the 
implementation of more detailed survey forms. 
Information on electricity used for pumped hydro has been available since 2012, 
but it is confidential in 2020.

United Arab Emirates 
General notes 
Data for the United Arab Emirates are available starting in 1971.  
Crude  oil  production  and  export  data  do  not  include  field  condensate.  Field 
condensate quantities are included with natural gas liquids. 
In the 2022 edition, the IEA Secretariat revised several supply and demand flows 
of  NGL,  ethane,  naphtha  and  LPG  from  2015  and  2019  due  to  new  available 
information.  Furthermore,  crude  oil  refinery  input  in  2016  was  revised  to  better 
reflect official data from the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority. 
In the  2021  edition,  oil  densities for  several  products  were  revised to  align  with 
the  UAE’s  official  values.  This  implies  revisions  especially  to  the  NGL,  LPG, 
lubricants, ethane and naphtha time series. 
In 
the  2021  edition, 
the 
IEA  Secretariat  revised  non-energy  use 
final 
consumption data for oil and gas in the petrochemical sector from 2015 to 2018, 
in  order  to  take  into  account  developments  in  this  sector  in  the  UAE,  including 
the third expansion of the Borouge Cracker in 2015. Products affected by these 
revisions are NGLs, naphtha, ethane and LPG, as well as natural gas.     
In  the  2020  edition,  production,  trade  and  consumption  flows  of  natural  gas 
liquids, crude oil and most of the secondary oil products have been revised due 
to  newly  available  information  and  historical  changes  from  the  Federal 
Competitiveness  and  Statistics  Authority  (FCSA)  and  from  the  Organization  of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for the period 1980-2017. 
In  the  2020  edition,  new  information  on  electricity  was  made  available  by  the 
FCSA.  This  led  to  revisions  in  production  and  imports  series  as  well  as  natural 
gas consumption for power generation from 2007 onwards.  
In  the  2020  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  estimated  electricity  own  use  in  the 
power  and  heat  industry  and  electricity  used  for  desalination,  based  on  new 
information made available by the FCSA from 2007 onwards. This might cause a 
break in electricity own use time series between 2006 and 2007. 
In  the  2020  edition,  wind  production  was  estimated  based  on  capacities 
published  by  the  International  Renewable  Energy  Agency  (IRENA),  from  2013 
onwards.

In  the  2018  edition,  information  on  asphalt,  lubricants,  and  other  oil  products 
were  made  available.  Breaks  in  time  series  for  these  products  can  be  seen 
between 2015 and 2016.  
Sources  for  electricity  data  in  2016  show  reclassification  from  other  non-
specified consumption to commercial and public services. A break in time series 
can be observed between 2015 and 2016.  
In the 2018 edition, revisions in oil products supply and stocks can be observed 
since 2009 due to newly available data.  
In the 2015 edition, time series for oil, gas, and coal data were revised according 
to  data  from  FCSA.  Breaks  in  time  series  can  be  observed  in  2009  for  coal, 
crude oil production and trade. 
In  2015,  Ruwais  refining  complex  expansion  was  completed,  significantly 
increasing  refined  oil  products  production  and  oil  industry  own  use  of  refinery 
inputs.  
In  the  2013  edition,  time  series  on  electricity  imports  and  exports  were  revised 
due to new information available on international trade at the interconnectors for 
the  United  Arab  Emirates. This may  lead  to revisions  to these time  series from 
2007. 
Time  series  revisions  in  natural  gas  liquids  (NGL)  production  were  advised  by 
the FCSA. Breaks in time series can be observed in 2011 for NGL.

Uruguay 
General notes 
Data for Uruguay are available starting in 1971.  
In  the  2022  edition,  LPG  data  for  2019  and  petroleum  coke  data  for  2018  and 
2019 have been revised due to new available information on their calorific values 
for those years. 
In the 2021 edition, communication with the Dirección Nacional de Energía led to 
data  revisions,  increasing  the  detail  of  the  energy  balance.  A  methanol  time 
series is now available from 2010, included in biogasoline. Hydrogen production 
from a pilot project is now available from 2016 and included in biogases. Biogas 
from  thermal  processes  in  the  paper  industry  is  not  reported  separately  for 
confidentiality reasons; they are included with solid biofuels. As a result of those 
additions, the series for primary solid biofuels and biogasoline are revised from 
2010 onwards. The series for naphtha is also revised from 1971 to 1989. 
In  the  2020  edition,  historical  data  across  multiple  years  and  products  were 
revised in line with the latest historical data available from Dirección Nacional de 
Energía.  Data  were  revised  from  1971  onwards  for  coal,  oil,  oil  products  and 
electricity, from 1981 onwards for hydro, from 1998 onwards for natural gas and 
from 2010 onwards for solar photovoltaic. 
In  2017,  La Teja  refinery  was  mostly  inactive  which  leads to  sharp  decrease  in 
refinery outputs. Refinery activity recovered in 2018. 
The  pronounced growth in  production  of  biofuels  and  waste from  2007  to  2010 
results from the development of the pulp and paper industry. 
The  power  produced  from  the  Salto  Grande  hydroelectric  plant,  located  on  the 
Uruguay River between Concordia in Argentina and Salto in Uruguay is equally 
shared  between  the  two  countries.  Exports  include  power  produced  in  Salto 
Grande and exported to Argentina. 
The refinery was shut down for maintenance in 1993-1994. This explains the low 
refinery output observed in 1993 and the absence of output in 1994.

Uzbekistan 
General notes 
Data for Uzbekistan are available starting in 1990. Prior to that, they are included 
in Former Soviet Union. 
Uzbekistan is one of the 11 EU4Energy focus countries. 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  State  Committee  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  on 
Statistics submitted data on electricity, coal, natural gas and oil through the joint 
IEA/Eurostat/UNECE 
annual 
energy 
questionnaires  with 
improved 
disaggregation of data. This led to breaks in time series between 2019 and 2020. 
In  the  2021  edition,  the  State  Committee  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  on 
Statistics submitted data on electricity, coal, natural gas and oil through the joint 
IEA/Eurostat/UNECE  annual  energy  questionnaires,  with  revisions  for  the 
historical  data  of  non-bio  jet kerosene,  diesel  and  bitumen.  Revisions  may  also 
affect diesel and gasoline between 2013 and 2016. 
Also  in  the  2021  edition,  new  data  available  led  to  the  addition  of  heat 
transmission and distribution losses from 1990 onwards.  
In  the  2020  edition  the  State  Committee  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  on 
Statistics submitted data on electricity, coal, natural gas and oil through the joint 
IEA/Eurostat/UNECE  annual  energy  questionnaires.  Historical  time  series  were 
therefore revised by the IEA Secretariat from 1998 to 2017. Motor gasoline has 
been further revised from 1990 onwards and aviation gasoline from 1996.  
From  the  2020  edition  onwards,  the  State  Committee  of  the  Republic  of 
Uzbekistan on Statistics started publishing national energy balance. As a result 
of  this,  2018  and  2019  data  contains  more  disaggregation  of  demand  data 
across products, and breaks in the time series exist between 2017 and 2018. 
For  biofuels  and  waste,  natural  gas  demand  and  non-energy  oil  products  few 
data are available up to 2017. Supply data are available from secondary sources 
and consumption is estimated.  
Fuel  input  to  electricity  and  heat  plant  and  outputs  are  estimated  by  the  IEA 
Secretariat,  with  estimates  being  better  informed  from  2018  onwards  by  data 
from State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan.

Venezuela 
General notes 
Data for Venezuela are available starting in 1971.  
In the 2022 edition, the production and exports of other bituminous coal for 2019 
were revised due to new available information. 
In  the  2021  and  2022  edition,  as  for  the  2020  edition,  no  data  were  available 
from  Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) for  2018,  2019  and 2020. Thus,  all 
crude  oil  and  oil  products  data  are  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  based  on 
data from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).  
In  the  2021  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  revised  their  estimates  for  LPG  non-
energy  use  in  the  petrochemical  sector  for  2018  to  account  for  the  lack  of 
feedstock availability in the country. 
In the 2020 edition, natural gas data were revised from 2008 onwards, following 
new  information  from  PDVSA  on  the  industrial  split  of  natural  gas,  and  IEA 
Secretariat estimates. 
In the  2020  edition, the oil  balance  was  revised  in  order to reflect the  available 
data  from  the  Ministerio  de  Petróleos  and  PDVSA.  As  a  result,  a  series  of 
revisions  is  listed  below.  Crude  oil  production,  exports  and  refinery  inputs  were 
revised  from  1999  to  reflect  Petróleo  y  Otros  Datos  Estadísticos  (PODE) 
information  and  PDVSA 
information  up 
to  2017.  Orimulsion  and 
lease 
condensate  were  revised  from  2001  onwards.  Natural  gas  liquids  were  revised 
from  1999.  Refinery  feedstocks  were  revised  from  1999  to  incorporate 
information from PODE and PDVSA; this includes multiple unspecified products, 
and  leads  to  structural  breaks  in  the  time  series  between  1998  and  1999. 
Feedstocks imports can also include méthyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Ethane data 
are available from 1999 onwards. Production problems led to propane having a 
significant  role  in  petrochemical  activities.  LPG  data  are  available  from  1999 
onwards,  and  include  propane,  iso-butane,  normal-butane  and  propane-butane 
mixes.  Naphtha  data  are  available  from  1999  onwards,  including  refinery 
production and natural gasoline/pentane output from gas separation plants. 
In  the  2020  edition,  an  allocation  between  domestic  and  international  aviation 
consumption  of  jet  kerosene  was  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  since  2012. 
This may lead break in time series between 2011 and 2012.

Motor gasoline production, transfers and use in road transport have been revised 
from 1999 onwards. Transfers include residual naphtha only. Export is estimated 
between 1999 and 2006. Import data from 2010-2017 are sourced from PDVSA. 
Paraffin waxes, refinery gas and petcoke have been revised from 1999 to reflect 
data  from  PODE.  Exports  are  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat.  Other  non-
specified oil products are partially estimated by the IEA Secretariat and include 
multiple unspecified products, as well as sulphur. Fuel oil production and exports 
are  estimated  by  the  IEA  Secretariat  from  2016  onwards.  Diesel  production  is 
estimated from 2017 onwards. 
The  multiple  revisions  made  in  the  2020  edition  lead  to  structural  breaks 
between 1998 and 1999. 
Up  to  2017,  crude  oil  production  data  are  obtained  from  PDVSA  with  lease 
condensate removed.  
Lease  condensate  quantities  are  included  in  natural  gas  liquids  (NGL)  from 
2000. This may lead to breaks in time series between 1999 and 2000. 
Revised  data  for  the  years  2005-2011  were  provided  by  the  Latin  American 
Energy  Organization  (OLADE).  These  revisions  may  lead  to  breaks  in  time 
series  between  2004  and  2005  and  differences  in  trends  in  comparison  to 
previous editions.

Viet Nam 
General notes 
Data for Viet Nam are available starting in 1971.  
Data  for  stock  changes  may  contain  statistical  differences  for  some  energy 
products. 
Data for international marine bunkers of fuel oil are estimated to be 80% of water 
transport fuel oil consumption reported in Viet Nam energy balances since 1990. 
The breakdown of natural gas input to main activity producer and autoproducer 
electricity  plants,  and  the  corresponding  electricity  output  have  been  estimated 
by IEA Secretariat since 2011. 
In the absence of detailed information, coal data are broken down by type by the 
IEA Secretariat.  
In  the  2022  edition,  new  data  source,  Vietnam  Energy  Statistics,  became 
available  for  2015-2019  and  preliminary  2020  data.  This  led  to  a  series  of 
revisions for 2015-2019 data. 
In  the  2021  edition,  data  for  2016-2018  were  revised  as  new  information  from 
Asia  Pacific  Energy  Research  Centre  (APERC)  became  available.  This  might 
lead to a break in time series between 2015 and 2016 for the following products 
and  flows:  anthracite,  bituminous  coal,  sub-bituminous  coal,  solid  biofuels, 
natural  gas,  crude  oil,  NGL,  LPG,  motor  gasoline,  kerosene  type  jet  fuel,  other 
kerosene,  gas/diesel,  fuel  oil,  lubricants,  bitumen  and  electricity  for  production, 
trade,  stock  changes,  international/domestic  bunkers,  transformation,  industry, 
transport, residential, commercial and agriculture sector. 
In  the  2021  edition,  charcoal  production  and  residential  consumption  data  prior 
to  2016  were  revised  using  the  charcoal  production  efficiency  derived  from  the 
revised balances submitted by Viet Nam to APERC. 
In  the  2021  edition,  peat  production  and  import  data  from  2011  onwards  were 
revised to 0 based on new information from revised balances submitted by Viet 
Nam to APERC. 
In  the  2021  edition,  coking  coal  production  data  from  2011  onwards  were 
retrieved from Thai Nguyen Iron and Steel Joint Stock Company (TISCO). Input 
to coke oven of coking coal and iron and steel sector consumption of coke oven

coke  were  then  estimated.  Coke  oven  coke  trade  data  were  revised  using  UN 
Comtrade database.  
In  the  2021  edition,  the  revised  balances  submitted  by  Viet  Nam  to  APERC 
include new detailed information on solid and liquid biofuels produced and used 
in the country. Detailed time series for bagasse, other solid vegetal matters and 
biogasoline have been created for the years 2016 to 2019.  
In the 2020 edition, data for condensate were revised from 2005 to 2014 based 
on  new  information from  APERC.  Fuelwood  input to charcoal  production plants 
from 2000 to 2014 were revised due to the revision of rural population data. 
In  the  2020  edition,  new  information  on  international/domestic  aviation  bunker 
and  rail  consumption  became  available  in  the  2018  Vietnam  Energy  Balance 
Tables. 
In the 2019 edition, some 2015 and 2016 data were revised to adapt to Vietnam 
Energy  Balance Tables updated format. This  may  lead  to  breaks  in time series 
for some flows between 2014 and 2015.

Yemen 
General notes 
Data for Yemen are available starting in 1971.  
Due to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, no official government data sources were 
available  since  2017.  From  the  2019  edition,  data  are  primarily  based  on 
secondary sources, media reports and IEA Secretariat estimates. 
In the 2022 edition, crude oil production and refinery input figures as well as NGL 
and  oil  products  production  were  revised  from  2016  onwards  due  to  new 
available information or revisions from secondary sources. 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  IEA  Secretariat  estimated  crude  oil,  jet  kerosene  and 
naphtha exports from 2016 onwards due to new information available.  
In  the  2021  edition,  refinery  production  of  LPG,  motor  gasoline,  kerosene  and 
fuel oil has been revised by the IEA Secretariat from 2016 onwards due to new 
information available. 
In the 2021 edition, due to new available information the IEA Secretariat revised 
charcoal figures from 1989 onwards. 
In the 2020 edition, revisions to crude oil data in 2016 and 2017 and natural gas 
data in 2017 are due to revisions in secondary sources. 
In the 2020 edition, natural gas liquids production and corresponding processing 
into LPG were revised from 2014 onwards based on IEA Secretariat oil and gas 
experts’ estimates. 
In  the  2020  edition,  solar  photovoltaic  electricity  generation  was  revised  by  the 
IEA  Secretariat  for  2016  and  2017  based  on  International  Renewable  Energy 
Agency (IRENA) estimates. 
In  the  2018  edition,  revisions  to  electricity  inputs  and  consumption  from  2014-
2015 are based on IEA Secretariat estimates.  
Oil and gas activity was halted in 2015 due to military conflict, affecting oil and oil 
products data from 2015-2016. In 2016, no exports occurred.

Former Yugoslavia 
General notes 
Data  for  individual  countries  of  the  Former  Yugoslavia  are  available  starting  in 
1990, and most of the information on 1990 and 1991 was estimated by the IEA 
Secretariat.  Because  of  large  breaks  in  reporting  which  occurred  in  the  early 
1990’s, breaks in time series may occur in 1990 for all regional totals.

Zambia 
General notes 
Data for Zambia are available starting in 1971.  
Zambia is one of the ten countries that benefit from EU Support to IEA Data for 
Affordable and Sustainable Energy System for Sub-Saharan Africa. 
In August 2016, a coal thermal power plant with an installed capacity of 300 MW 
was commissioned in Maamba, Sinazongwe District. 
Crude oil imports reported by Zambia’s Energy Regulation Board (ERB) include 
petroleum feedstocks comprised of crude oil, naphtha, condensate, and gasoil.  
In the 2022 edition, gas/diesel oil consumption flows were revised from 2018 to 
2019  to  better  align  with  total  gas/diesel  oil  demand  reported  by  ERB.  Jet 
kerosene imports were also revised from 2017 to 2019 to reflect ERB data. 
In  the  2021  edition,  new  information  on  the  refinery  activity  available  led  to 
revisions of the inputs and outputs value in our data from 2016 onward. 
In the 2021 edition, new information available led to revisions of the production 
of primary solid biofuels and charcoal from 2000 onward. 
In  the  2015  edition,  information  on  refinery  yields  was  obtained  and  applied  to 
the  refinery  production  from  2001.  Therefore,  breaks  in  time  series  may  occur 
between 2000 and 2001. 
A fire damaged the sole oil refinery (Indeni) in Zambia in 2000. Therefore, breaks 
in time series may occur between 1999 and 2000, as well as between 2000 and 
2001.

Zimbabwe 
General notes 
Data for Zimbabwe are available starting in 1971.  
In  the  2022  edition,  electricity  supply  and  demand  data  were  revised  for  year 
2019, using new information provided by ZERA. 
Supply side for coal products is estimated using trade figures and trade growth 
trends.  In  the  2022  edition,  when  latest  demand  side  data  was  not  available  a 
ratio  based  on  supply  side  growth 
is  used.  A  mining  company  was 
commissioned  in  2011,  leading  to  a  rapid  increase  in  coal  production.  Due  to 
limited  availability  of  coal  consumption  data,  the  IEA  Secretariat  has  estimated 
coal  stocks  for  Zimbabwe.  Breaks  in  time  series  may  occur  between  2013  and 
2014 because of this. 
Supply  side  for  oil  products  is  estimated  using  trade  figures  and  trade  growth 
trends.  In  the  2022  edition,  when  latest  demand  side  data  was  not  available  a 
ratio based on supply side growth is used. 
Biofuels data is calculated based on the population growth rate when no official 
sources is available.  
More  detailed  data  on  energy  consumption  is  available  from  the  Census  of 
Industrial  Production  (ZimStat)  since  2009.  Breaks  in  time  series  may  occur 
between 2008 and 2009 because of this. 
More detailed data on road fuel imports is available since 2011. Breaks in time 
series may occur between 2010 and 2011 because of this.

General notes 
Time  series  for  this  region  are  obtained  by  summing  data  corresponding  to 
individual  countries  (see  lists  in  section  I.5,  Geographical  coverage).  As  a 
consequence,  intra-regional  trade  is  included  as  part  of  total  trade.  Therefore, 
trade is likely to be overstated. 
The UN Statistics Division Energy statistics database is the main data source for 
the countries included in the region. At the time when this edition was prepared 
data  up  to  2019  were  available.  All  data  points  for  2020  have  therefore  been 
estimated  equal  to  2019  values  or  based  on  developments  in  population  and 
GDP  in  the  region  as  well  as  renewables  capacity  growth.  All  2019  estimated 
data  points  for  the  2021  edition  have  been  revised  based  on  the  officially 
reported  data.  Besides,  some  data  points  may  be  revised  between  1971  and 
2019  due  to  revisions  or  new  available  information  in  the  UN  Energy  Statistics 
database. 
In  the  2022  edition,  Kingdom  of  Eswatini,  Madagascar,  Rwanda  and  Uganda 
were  removed  from  the  aggregate  for  the  full  time  series  and  are  available 
separately. 
In  the  2021  edition,  Niger  (previously  included  for  1971-1999  data),  was 
removed from the aggregate for the full time series and is available separately. 
Furthermore, Djibouti statistics have been included for the period 1971-1989. 
In the 2021 edition, new information on the industrial use of electricity, gasoline, 
other  kerosene,  gas/diesel  oil,  petroleum  coke,  bitumen,  bituminous  coal  and 
primary  solid  biofuels  resulted  in  a  reallocation  of  industrial  consumption  flows 
from 1990 onwards. 
In the 2021 edition, newly available information regarding the conversion factors 
of primary solid biofuels led to a revision of the whole time series. 
In  the  2020  edition,  Equatorial  Guinea  data  were  removed  from  this  aggregate 
for the full time series; Botswana data were removed from 1971 to 1980.  
In  the  2019  edition,  La  Réunion  data  were  removed  from  this  aggregate  from 
2011 onwards. From 2011 onwards, they are included in French data. Breaks in 
time series might occur for biogas between 2010 and 2011.

The UN Statistics Division Energy Statistics database is the main data source for 
the countries not listed individually and included in the region. At the time when 
this edition was prepared data up to 2019 were available. All data points for 2020 
have therefore been estimated equal to 2019 values or based on developments 
in population and GDP in the region as well as renewables capacity growth. All 
2019 estimated data points for the 2021 edition have been revised based on the 
officially  reported  data.  Besides,  in  the  2022  edition  some  data  points  may  be 
revised due to revisions of the UN Statistics Division database.  
From  2017  data  onwards,  Puerto  Rican  electricity  generation  and 
the 
corresponding  fuels’  consumption  are  included  in  the  data  submitted  by  the 
United  States.  This  creates  inconsistencies  between  supply  and  demand  of 
natural  gas  in  Other  non-OECD  Americas  from  2017,  as  natural  gas  trade 
statistics are reported in this regional aggregate, as well as breaks in electricity 
generation time series between 2016 and 2017. Puerto Rico coal trade data and 
all  oil  data  from  2002  are  similarly  reported  by  the  United  States  and  therefore 
not included in this regional aggregate. 
In  the  2022  edition,  the  whole  time  series  of  electricity  consumption  in  non-
specified industry, commercial and public services and non-specified other were 
significantly revised due to new available information. Furthermore, we retrieved 
new data on fuel oil imports and use in main activity producer electricity in Puerto 
Rico between 1990 and 2002. 
In  the  2022,  we  added  biogasoline  and  biodiesel  statistics  as  new  information  
became available. 
In  the  2021  edition,  other  bituminous  coal  input  to  main  activity  producer 
electricity plants and the corresponding electricity output was revised from 2000 
onwards due to newly available data. 
In the 2021 edition, new available information regarding the conversion factor of 
fuelwood resulted in a revision of the whole time series.

Methodological notes 
This publication is based on the data in physical units of the IEA World Energy 
Statistics  publication,  which  follow  the  definitions  of  the  United  Nations 
International  Recommendations  for  Energy  Statistics  (IRES)19  and  on  the  IEA 
energy balance methodology, briefly summarised below. 
Energy balance: key concepts 
Energy data are generally collected independently across different commodities. 
Energy  statistics  are  the  simplest  format  to  present  all  the  data  together, 
assembling  the  individual  balances  of  all  products,  each  expressed  in  its  own 
physical  unit  (e.g.  TJ  for  natural  gas,  kt  for  coal,  etc).  These  are  called 
commodity balances. 
However, energy products can be converted into one another through a number 
of  transformation  processes.  Therefore,  it  is  very  useful  to  also  develop  one 
comprehensive  national  energy  balance,  to  understand  how  products  are 
transformed  into  one  another,  and  to  highlight  the  various  relationships  among 
them.  
By presenting all the data in a common energy unit, the energy balance allows 
users  to  see  the  total  amount  of  energy  used  and  the  relative  contribution  of 
each  different  source,  for 
the  whole  economy  and  for  each 
individual 
consumption  sector;  to  compute  the  different fuel  transformation  efficiencies; to 
develop  various  aggregated  indicators  (for  example  consumption  per  capita  or 
per unit of GDP) and to estimate CO2 emissions from fuel combustion.  
The  energy  balance  is  a  natural  starting  point  to  study  the  evolution  of  the 
domestic  energy  market,  forecast  energy  demand,  monitor  impacts  of  energy 
policies  and  assess  potential  areas  for  action.  The  statistician  also  uses  the 
energy  balance  as  a  high-level  check  on  the  data  accuracy,  as  large  statistical 
differences 
in  energy  units,  apparent  energy  gains  or 
large 
losses 
in 
transformation  processes,  or  large  unexplained  variations  in  shares  or  in  high-
level indicators may all indicate underlying data problems.

The energy balance takes the form of a matrix, where columns present all the different 
energy  sources  (“products”)  categories  and  rows  represent  all  the  different  “flows”, 
grouped  in  three  main  blocks:  energy  supply,  transformation/energy  use  and  final 
consumption.  
To develop an energy balance from the set of commodity balances, the two main 
steps are: i) all the data are converted to a common energy unit – also allowing 
to  compute  a  “total”  product;  and  ii) some  re-formatting  is  performed  to  avoid 
double  counting  when  summing  all  products  together.  For  example,  for 
secondary  products  (e.g. motor  gasoline)  the  production  appears  in  the 
production  row  in  commodity  balances,  but  is  reported  as  an  output  of  the 
relevant  transformation  (e.g. oil  refineries)  in  an  energy  balance,  where  the 
production row only refers to production of primary products (e.g. crude oil). 
The  methodological  assumptions  underlying  energy  balances,  discussed  in  the 
next section, are particularly important to understand differences across balances 
derived by different national and international organisations starting from the same 
energy commodity data. 
IEA energy balances methodology 
The  unit  adopted  by  the  IEA  is  the  tonne  of  oil  equivalent  (toe),  defined  as 
107 kilocalories  (41.868 gigajoules).  This  quantity  of  energy  is,  within  a  few  per 
cent, equal to the net heat content of 1 tonne of crude oil. Conversion of the IEA 
energy balances to other energy units would be straightforward. 
The  main  methodological  choices  underlying  energy  balances 
that  can 
differentiate  the  final  balances  layout  across  organisations  are:  i) “net”  versus 
“gross” energy content; ii) calorific values; and iii) primary energy conventions.  
Net versus gross energy content  
The IEA energy balances are based on a “net” energy content, which excludes the 
energy  lost  to  produce  water  vapour  during  combustion.  All  the  elements  of  the 
energy  balance  are  expressed  on  the  same  net  basis  to  ensure  comparability. 
Even elements (e.g. natural gas) that in commodity balances may be already in 
energy  units  but  on  a  different  basis  (e.g. “gross”)  are  converted  (e.g.  from 
“gross” to “net”).  
The difference between the "net" and the "gross" calorific value for each fuel is 
the  latent  heat  of  vaporisation  of  the  water  produced  during  combustion  of  the 
fuel. For coal and oil, the net calorific value is about 5% less than gross, for most

forms  of  natural  and  manufactured  gas  the  difference  is  9-10%,  while  for 
electricity and heat there is no difference as they are not combusted. 
Calorific values 
Generally, the IEA adopts country-specific, time-varying, and for some products 
flow-dependent, net calorific values supplied by national administrations for most 
products;  and  regional  default  values  (in  conjunction  with  Eurostat  for  the 
European countries) for the oil products. More detailed explanations on the IEA 
conversion to energy units for the different energy sources are given in Section 2, 
Units and conversions.  
Primary energy conventions 
A very important methodological choice is the definition of the “primary energy 
equivalent” for the electricity and heat produced from non-combustible sources, 
such  as  nuclear,  geothermal,  solar,  hydro,  wind.  The  information  collected  is 
generally  the  amount  of  electricity  and  heat  produced,  represented  in  the 
balance as an output of transformation. Conventions are needed to compute the 
most appropriate corresponding primary energy, input to the transformation, both 
in form and in amount. 
The  principle  adopted  by  the  IEA  is  that  the  primary  energy  form  is  the  first 
energy  form  downstream  in  the  production  process  for  which  multiple  energy 
uses are practical. For example, the first energy form that can be used as energy 
in  the  case  of  nuclear  is  the  nuclear  heat  of  the  reactor,  most  of  which  is  then 
transformed into electricity. The application of this principle leads to the choice of 
the following primary energy forms: 
  Electricity for primary electricity (hydro, wind, tide/wave/ocean and solar 
photovoltaic). 
  Heat for heat and secondary electricity (nuclear, geothermal and solar thermal). 
 
Once  the  primary  energy form  is  identified for  all  electricity  and  heat generated 
from  non-combustible  sources,  the  IEA  adopts  the  physical  energy  content 
method  to  compute the corresponding  primary  energy  equivalent  amounts:  the 
primary  energy  equivalent  is  simply  the  physical  energy  content  of  the 
corresponding primary energy form.  
For primary electricity, such as hydro and solar PV, as electricity is identified as 
the  primary  energy  form,  the  primary  energy  equivalent  is  simply  the  gross 
electricity generated in the plant.

For  nuclear  electricity,  the  primary  energy  equivalent  is  the  quantity  of  heat 
generated in the reactors. In the absence of country-specific information, the IEA 
estimates  the  primary  energy  equivalent  from  the  electricity  generated  by 
assuming  an  efficiency  of  33%,  derived  as  the  average  efficiency  of  nuclear 
power  plants  across  Europe.  Note  that  the  principle  of  using  the  heat  from 
nuclear  reactors  as  the  primary  energy  form  for  the  energy  statistics  has  an 
important  effect  on  any  indicators  of  energy  supply  dependence.  Under  the 
present  convention,  the  primary  nuclear  heat  appears  as  an  indigenous 
resource.  However,  the  majority  of  countries  using  nuclear  power  import  their 
nuclear  fuel,  and  if  this  fact  could  be  taken  into  account,  it  would  lead  to  an 
increase in the supply dependence on other countries. 
For geothermal  electricity,  the  primary  energy  equivalent  is the quantity of  heat 
and a similar back-calculation is used where the quantities of steam supplied to 
the plant are not measured, assuming a thermal efficiency of 10%. This figure is 
only approximate and reflects the fact that the steam from geothermal sources is 
generally  of  low  quality.  If  data  for  the  steam  input  to  geothermal  power  plants 
are available, they are used directly as primary energy equivalent. 
Similarly, for solar thermal plants the heat supply is back-calculated assuming a 
33%  efficiency  of  conversion  of  heat  into  electricity,  reflecting  relatively  low 
working  temperatures,  although  central  receiver  systems  can  reach  higher 
temperatures and therefore higher efficiencies. 
In summary, for geothermal and solar thermal, if no country-specific information 
is  reported,  the  primary  energy  equivalent  is  calculated  using  the  following 
efficiencies: 
  10% for geothermal electricity; 
  50% for geothermal heat; 
  33% for solar thermal electricity; 
  100% for solar thermal heat. 
 
An alternative to the physical energy content method is the partial substitution 
method, used in the past by the IEA. In this case, the primary energy equivalent 
of  the  electricity  generated  from  non-combustible  sources  is  computed  as  the 
hypothetical  amount  of  energy  necessary  to  generate  the  same  amount  of 
electricity  in  thermal  power  plants,  assuming  an  average  generation  efficiency. 
The method was abandoned by the IEA and other organisations because it had 
little  meaning  for  countries  with  significant  hydro  electricity  generation,  and 
because the actual substitution values were hard to establish, as they depended

on the efficiency of the marginal electricity production. It also had unreal effects 
on  the  energy  balance,  as  transformation  losses  appeared  without  a  physical 
basis. 
Since  the  two  methods  differ  significantly  in  the  treatment  of  solar,  hydro,  etc., 
the share of renewables in total energy supply varies depending on the method. 
To  interpret  shares  of  various  energy  sources  in  total  supply,  it  is  important  to 
understand the conventions used to calculate the primary energy supply.

Notes on data quality 
Methodology  
For  OECD  Member  countries,  the  data  shown  in  this  publication  are  based  on 
information  provided  in  the  five  annual  OECD  questionnaires20:  “Oil”,  “Natural 
Gas”,  “Coal  (Solid  Fossil  Fuels  and  Manufactured  Gases)”,  “Renewables  and 
Wastes”  and  “Electricity  and  Heat”  completed  by  the  national  administrations. 
For the member countries of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United 
Nations (UNECE) and a few others, the data shown in this publication are mostly 
based on information provided by the national administrations through the same 
annual questionnaires. The commodity balances for all other countries are based 
as much as possible on national official energy data, but also potentially on other 
data  of  heterogeneous  nature,  converted  and  adapted  to fit  the IEA format and 
methodology. 
Considerable  effort  has  been  made  to  ensure  that  the  data  presented  in  this 
publication  adhere 
to 
the 
IEA  definitions 
reported 
in 
the  section  on 
the  United  Nations 
Methodological  notes.  These  definitions,  based  on 
International Recommendations for Energy Statistics21, are used by most of the 
international organisations that collect energy statistics.  
Nevertheless,  energy  statistics  at  the  national  level  are  often  collected  using 
criteria  and  definitions  which  differ,  sometimes  considerably,  from  those  of 
international  organisations.  This  is  especially  true  for  non-OECD  countries, 
which  are  submitting  data  to  the  IEA  on  a  voluntary  basis.  The  IEA  Secretariat 
has  identified  and  documented  most  of  these  differences  and,  where  possible, 
adjusted the data to meet international definitions.  
Recognised  differences  occurring  in  specific  countries  are  presented  in  the 
section on Country notes and sources. Country notes present the most important 
deviations from the IEA methodology, and are by no means a comprehensive list 
of  those.  To  ensure  transparency,  country  notes  also  describe  how  data  are 
estimated or revised, where relevant for the data user.

Estimation 
In addition to adjustments addressing differences in definitions, estimations22 are 
sometimes  required  to  complete  major  aggregates,  when  key  statistics  are 
missing. 
The  IEA  secretariat  has  attempted  to  provide  all  the  elements  of  energy 
balances  down  to  the  level  of  final  consumption,  for  all  countries  and  years. 
Providing all the elements of supply, as well as all inputs and outputs of the main 
transformation activities (such as oil refining and electricity generation), has often 
required  estimations.  Estimations  have  been  generally  made  after  consultation 
with  national  statistical  offices,  oil  companies,  electricity  utilities  and  national  or 
international energy experts. 
Time series and political changes 
The  IEA  secretariat  reviews  its  databases  each  year.  In  the  light  of  new 
assessments,  important  revisions  may  be  made  to  time  series  of  individual 
countries  during  the  course  of  this  review.  Therefore,  some  data  in  this 
publication  have  been  substantially  revised  with  respect  to  previous  editions. 
Please always consult the section on Country notes and sources. 
Generally  speaking,  energy  statistics  for  some  countries  undergo  continuous 
changes in their coverage or methodology. Consequently, breaks in time series 
are considered to be unavoidable.  
For  example,  energy  balances for  the  individual  countries  of  the  Former Soviet 
Union and the Former Yugoslavia have been constructed since 1990 and are not 
available  for  previous  years.  These  balances  are  generally  based  on  official 
submissions,  but  estimations  also  have  been made  by  the  IEA secretariat. The 
section on Country notes and sources describes in detail these elements country 
by country. 
Classification of fuel uses 
National statistical sources often lack adequate information on the consumption 
of fuels in different categories of end use. Many countries do not conduct annual 
surveys of consumption in the main sectors of economic activity, and published 
 
                                                                 
22 Data may not include all informal and/or illegal trade, production or consumption of energy products, although the IEA 
Secretariat makes efforts to estimate these where reliable information is available.

data may be based on out-of-date surveys. Therefore, sectoral disaggregation of 
consumption should generally be interpreted with caution.  
In  countries  of  non-OECD  Europe  and  Eurasia  and  in  China,  the  sectoral 
classification  of  fuel  consumption  before  the  reforms  of  the  1990’s  significantly 
differed  from  that  of  IRES.  Sectoral  consumption  was  defined  according  to  the 
economic branch of the user, rather than according to the purpose or use of the 
fuel.  For  example, consumption  of gasoline  in  the  vehicle  fleet  of  an  enterprise 
attached to the economic branch ‘Iron and steel’ was classified as consumption 
in the ‘Iron and steel’ industry itself.  
Where  possible,  data  have  been  adjusted  to  fit  international  classifications,  for 
example by assuming that most gasoline is consumed in transport. However, it 
has not been possible to reclassify products other than gasoline and jet fuel as 
easily, and few other adjustments have been made to other products.  
Imports and exports  
For  a  given  product,  imports  and  exports  may  not  sum  up  to  zero  at  the  world 
level  for  a  number  of  reasons.  Fuels  may  be  classified  differently  (i.e. fuel  oil 
exports  may  be  reported  as  refinery  feedstocks  by  the  importing  country;  NGL 
exports may be reported as LPG by the importing country, etc.). Other possible 
reasons  include  discrepancies  in  conversion  factors,  inclusion  of  international 
bunkers  in  exports,  timing  differences,  data  reported  on  a  fiscal  year  basis 
instead of calendar year for certain countries, and underreporting of imports and 
exports for fiscal reasons.  
Specific issues by fuel 
Coal 
Data  on  sectoral  coal  consumption  are  usually  reported  in  metric  tonnes.  Net 
calorific  values  of  different  coal  types  used  in  different  end  use  sectors  are  not 
always  available.  In  the  absence  of  specific  information,  the  IEA  secretariat 
estimates end use net calorific values based on the available net calorific values 
for production, imports and exports. 
Oil 
The  IEA  secretariat  collects  comprehensive  statistics  for  oil  supply  and  use, 
including oil for own use of refineries, oil delivered to international bunkers, and

oil  used  as  petrochemical  feedstock.  National  statistics  often  do  not  report  all 
these amounts.  
Reported  production  of  refined  products  may  refer  to  net  rather  than  gross 
refinery output; consumption of oil products may be limited to sales to domestic 
markets  and  may  not  include  deliveries  to  international  shipping  or  aircraft.  Oil 
consumed  as  petrochemical  feedstock  in  integrated  refinery/petrochemical 
complexes is often not included in available official statistics. 
Where  possible,  the  IEA  secretariat  has  estimated  those  unreported  data,  in 
consultation with the oil industry. In the absence of any other indication, refinery 
fuel  use  is  estimated  to  be  a  percentage  (e.g. 5%)  of  refinery  throughput,  and 
where possible, split between refinery gas and fuel oil. For a descripttion of some 
adjustments  made  to  the  sectoral  consumption  of  oil  products,  see  the  above 
section ‘Classification of fuel uses’. 
Natural gas 
Natural  gas  should  be  comprised  mainly  of  methane;  other  gases,  such  as 
ethane and heavier hydrocarbons, should be reported under the heading of ‘oil’. 
The IEA defines natural gas production as the marketable production, i.e. net of 
field losses, flaring, venting and re-injection.  
However,  the  lack  of  adequate  definitions  makes  it  difficult  or  impossible  to 
identify  all  quantities  of  gas  at  all  different  stages  of  its  separation  into  dry  gas 
(methane)  and  heavier  fractions.  National  data  for  natural  gas  do  not  always 
explicitly  show  separate  quantities  for  field  losses,  flaring,  venting  and  re-
injection.  
Natural gas supply and demand statistics are normally reported in volumetric units 
and  it  is  difficult  to  obtain  accurate  data  on  the  calorific  value.  In  the  absence  of 
specific information, the IEA generally applies an average gross calorific value of 
38 TJ/million m3. 
For  the  countries  that  report  natural  gas  data  at  temperature  and  pressure 
conditions  of  20°C  and  101.325  kPa,  the  calorific  values  are  about  1.7%  lower 
than the equivalent at temperature and pressure conditions of 15°C and 101.325 
kPa.  However,  in  energy  terms  no  difference  is  observed  between  the  two 
reporting conditions as natural gas volumes measured at 20°C and 101.325 kPa 
are 1.7% higher than natural gas volumes at 15°C and 101.325 kPa. 
Reliable  consumption  data  for  natural  gas  at  a  disaggregated  level  are  often 
difficult  to  find.  This  is  especially  true  for  some  of  the  largest  natural  gas

consuming countries in the Middle East. Therefore, industrial use of natural gas 
for these countries is frequently missing from the data published here. 
Electricity 
The 
IEA  classification  shows 
‘main  activity  producers’  separately 
from 
‘autoproducers’  of  electricity  and  heat.  An  autoproducer  of  electricity  is  an 
establishment which, in addition to its main activities, generates electricity wholly 
or  partly  for  its  own  use.  For  non-OECD  countries,  data  on  autoproducers  are 
not  always  reported.  In  such  cases,  the  quantities  of  fuels  used  as  input  to 
electricity are included under the appropriate end-use sector. 
When statistics of production of electricity from biofuels and waste are available, 
they  are  included  in  total  electricity  production.  However,  these  data  are  not 
comprehensive;  for  example,  much  of  the  electricity  generated  from  waste 
biomass in sugar refining facilities remains unreported. 
When  unreported,  inputs  of  fuels  for  electricity  generation  are  estimated  using 
information on electricity output, fuel efficiency and type of generation capacity. 
Heat 
For heat, transition economies (countries of non-OECD Europe and Eurasia) and 
China  used  to  adopt  a  different  methodology  from  that  adopted  in  market 
economies. They allocated the transformation of primary fuels (coal, oil and gas) 
by industry into heat for consumption on site to the transformation activity ‘heat 
production’,  not  to  industrial  consumption,  as  in  the  IEA  methodology23.  The 
transformation output of Heat was then allocated to the various end use sectors. 
The losses occurring in the transformation of fuels into heat in industry were not 
included in final consumption of industry.  
Although  a  number  of  countries  have  recently  switched  to  the  practice  of 
international organisations, this important issue reduces the possibility of cross-
country  comparisons  for  sectoral  end  use  consumption  between  transition 
economies and market economies.  
Biofuels and waste 
The  IEA  publishes  data  on  production,  domestic  supply  and  consumption  of 
biofuels and waste for all countries and all regions. 
 
                                                                 
23 For autoproducer plants, the international methodology restricts the inclusion of heat in transformation processes to that 
sold to third parties.

Data  for  non-OECD  countries  are  often  based  on  secondary  sources  and  may 
be of variable quality, which makes comparisons between countries difficult. For 
many  countries,  historical  data  are  derived  from  surveys  which  were  often 
irregular, irreconcilable and conducted at a local rather than national level.  
Where official data are incomplete or unavailable, the IEA Secretariat estimates 
the  time  series  based  on  economic  indicators  and  secondary  sources.  Those 
estimated  time  series  should  be  treated  very  cautiously.  The  chart  below 
provides a broad indication of the estimation methodology and of the data quality 
by region.

Given the importance of vegetal fuels in the energy picture of many developing 
countries, balances down to final consumption by end-use for individual products 
or product categories have been compiled for all countries.  
The  IEA  hopes  that  the  inclusion  of  these  data  will  encourage  national 
administrations  and  other  agencies  active  in  the  field  to  enhance  the  level  and 
quality  of  data  collection  and  coverage  for  biofuels  and  waste.  More  details  on 
the  methodology  used  by  each  country  may  be  provided  on  request  and 
comments are welcome.

Energy content 
Coal 
Coal  has  separate  net  calorific  values  for  production,  imports,  exports,  inputs  to 
electricity/heat  generation  and  coal  used  in  coke  ovens,  blast  furnaces  and 
industry.  
For  electricity/heat  generation,  coal  inputs  to  each  type  of  plant  (i.e.  main  activity 
electricity plant, autoproducer electricity plant, main activity CHP plant, autoproducer 
CHP  plant,  main  activity  heat  plant,  autoproducer  heat  plant)  are  converted  to 
energy  units  using  average 
factors  calculated 
from 
the  Annual  Electricity 
Questionnaire. All other flows are converted using an average net calorific value.  
Crude oil 
Country-specific net calorific values (NCV) for production, imports and exports by 
country are used to calculate the balances. The average value is used to convert 
all the other flows to heat values.  
Gases 
World  Energy  Statistics expresses  the following gases  in  terajoules,  using their 
gross calorific value. 
Gas  data  provided  in  joules  should  be  converted  as  follows:  Data  in 
TJ / 41 868 = Data in Mtoe.

Biofuels and waste 
The  heat  content  of  primary  solid  biofuels,  biogases,  municipal  waste  and 
industrial  waste,  expressed  in  terajoules  on  a  net  calorific  value  basis,  is 
presented  in  World  Energy  Statistics.  The  Secretariat  does  not  receive 
information on volumes and other characteristics of these fuels.  
Data in TJ / 41 868 = Data in Mtoe. Data for charcoal are converted from tonnes 
using the average net calorific values given in the electronic tables. 
Unless country-specific information has been provided, data for biogasoline are 
converted  from  tonnes  using  26 800  kJ/kg.  Biodiesels  and  other  liquid  biofuels 
are  assumed  to  have  a  net  calorific  value  of  36 700 kJ/kg  unless  otherwise 
specified. 
Oil products 
For  oil  products,  the  IEA  applies  regional  net  calorific  values  (in  conjunction 
with  Eurostat  for  the  European  countries),  except  for  the  individual  countries 
listed in the table at the end of this section. 
Electricity 
Figures for electricity production, trade, and final consumption are calculated using 
the  energy  content  of  the  electricity.  Electricity  is  converted  as  follows:  Data  in 
TWh x 0.086 = data in Mtoe. 
Hydro-electricity  production  (excluding  pumped  storage)  and  electricity  produced 
by other non-thermal means (wind, tide/wave/ocean, solar PV, etc.) are accounted 
for  similarly.  Gross  electricity  generation  in  TWh  x  0.086  =  primary  energy 
equivalent in Mtoe.

The primary energy equivalent of nuclear electricity is calculated from the gross 
generation  by  assuming  a  33%  conversion  efficiency.  The  calculation  to  be 
carried  out  is the following: gross  electricity  generation  in TWh  x  0.086 / 0.33  = 
primary energy equivalent in Mtoe. 
In the case of electricity produced from geothermal heat, if the actual geothermal 
efficiency  is  not  known,  then  the  primary  equivalent  is  calculated  assuming  an 
efficiency  of  10%.  The  calculation  to  be  carried  out  is  the  following:  gross 
electricity generation in TWh x 0.086 / 0.10 = primary energy equivalent in Mtoe. 
For  electricity  produced  from  solar  thermal  heat,  the  primary  equivalent  is 
calculated assuming an efficiency of 33% unless the actual efficiency is known. 
The  calculation to  be  carried  out  is the following: gross  electricity generation  in 
TWh x 0.086 / 0.33 = primary energy equivalent in Mtoe.  
Heat 
Information on heat is supplied in terajoules and is converted as follows: Data in 
TJ / 41 868 = Data in Mtoe. 
In  the  case  of  heat  produced  in  a  geothermal  plant,  if  the  actual  geothermal 
efficiency  is  not  known,  then  the  primary  equivalent  is  calculated  assuming  an 
efficiency  of  50%.  The  calculation  to  be  carried  out  is  the  following:  Heat 
production in TJ x 0.0000238 / 0.50 = primary energy equivalent in Mtoe. 
For heat produced in a solar thermal plant, the primary equivalent is equal to the 
heat consumed. Data in TJ / 41 868 = data in Mtoe. 
For  direct  use  of  geothermal  and  solar  thermal  heat,  all  the  heat  consumed  is 
accounted for in production and consumption.
