FOREWORD: REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
Cyprus  has  one  of  the  highest  electricity  prices  in  Europe,  due  to 
high reliance on liquid fuel for power generation. However, a major 
transition is imminent for electricity supply. On one hand, indigenous 
natural gas discoveries are to be developed in the coming years. On 
the other hand, the costs of renewable power supply options have 
fallen  dramatically.  Meanwhile,  concerns  about  greenhouse  gases 
and  local  pollutants  have  increased,  reflecting  stringent  European 
Union regulations.
Renewable  energy  offers  a  way  for  Cyprus  to  reduce  both  the  cost  and  the  environmental 
impact of generating electricity. In the wake of the recent economic recession, turning to re-
newables can help to reduce fuel imports, strengthen the trade balance and create local jobs. 
The success of solar water heaters, for example, can be replicated for solar photovoltaics (PV).
Cyprus has set out to attain a higher share of renewables, and this roadmap helps to assess op-
timal investment strategies in the power sector. Solar PV and wind power will play a major role 
in the roadmap to 2030. Roadmap findings will play an important role to revise existing energy 
policies and develop new ones.
As  part  of  the  same  engagement,  the  energy  planning  model  used  to  quantify  the  possible 
pace and benefits of renewable energy deployment given different conditions has been handed 
over to the Government of Cyprus. The model will remain an important tool for assessing future 
energy policies and examining different energy pathways, and will assist in determining the op-
timal penetration of RES for electricity supply, identifying the technical and economic potential 
for further increasing electricity production by RES.
We would like to thank IRENA for this support and look forward to a continued close coopera-
tion in the future.

The 
cost-competitiveness  of  renewable  energy  makes  such  sources 
essential for energy security and access around the world. For islands, 
in particular, clean, indigenous renewable energy is inherently more 
attractive than costly fossil-fuel imports. Countries such as Cyprus, 
which depend heavily on imported petroleum products, are investing in clean energy sources to 
provide affordable energy, green jobs and modern supply chains, while contributing to reducing 
greenhouse-gas emissions in the post-2015 world.  
As an active participant in global efforts to ensure a sustainable energy future, the Republic 
of Cyprus has engaged with IRENA to develop a renewable energy roadmap for the country. 
The Ministry of Energy, Commerce, Industry and Tourism, along with a range of stakeholders, 
has worked closely with IRENA to examine least-cost pathways for the evolution of the power 
generation mix, the increasing role that renewable energy will play within it, and the impact of 
key decisions on energy policy that Cyprus is confronted with making today.
I trust this roadmap will prove useful in the country’s pursuit of accelerated renewable energy 
deployment. As our world strives for a future based on clean, secure and affordable energy for 
all, Cyprus can be the lighthouse that helps illuminate the course for others.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FOREWORD: IRENA
Roadmap structure
The national energy balance, along with two 
of the demand forecast scenarios developed, 
were used as key inputs to the second section 
of  the  roadmap  and  the  electricity  supply 
model on which that section is based.
The Renewable Energy Roadmap for the Re-
public  of  Cyprus  is  based  on  three  comple-
mentary  sections.  The  details  of  what  is  co-
vered by each section and how each of them 
relates to the others are described below.
2) Electricity supply model
In order to examine options for economically 
optimal  deployment  of  renewable  energy  in 
Cyprus under different scenarios, and to un-
derstand  the  potential  impact  of  key  policy 
decisions  on  the  power  generation  mix,  a 
long-term energy planning model of the cur-
rent power system in Cyprus was deve loped. 
The  Electricity  Supply  Model  for  Cyprus 
(ESMC) has been developed using the long-
term  energy  modelling  platform  called  the 
Model  for  Energy  Supply  Strategy  Alterna-
tives and their General Environmental Impact 
(MESSAGE)  (IIASA  2012).  This  is  a  dynamic, 
bottom-up, multi-year energy system model 
allowing the use of linear and mixed-integer 
optimisation techniques.
1)   Cyprus energy balance and 
demand forecasts
As  a  first  step  to  analysing  the  potential  for 
renewable energy deployment in Cyprus and 
answering key questions related to the impacts 
of  key  policy  decisions  for  the  energy  sec-
tor,  it  was  necessary  to  develop  an  extensive 
understanding  of  the  current  energy  use  in 
Cyprus, as well as demand forecasts, based on 
more  detailed  examination  of  current  energy 
use  and  its  possible  future  evolution  in  each 
demand  sector.  This  analysis  was  developed 
together  with  the  Cyprus  University  of  Tech-
nology (CUT) and is detailed in “Cyprus Energy 
Balance and Demand Forecasts”, one section 
of the full roadmap report, which provides:
This model was used to analyse the optimal 
evolution of the Cyprus electricity generation 
mix  to  meet  electricity  demand  under  dif-
ferent sets of assumptions, which led to the 
definition of six main scenarios (see Figure 1), 
which are explained below.
 ● A detailed national energy balance based 
on official 2012 data and provisional 2013 
data, with detailed analysis of residential 
energy demand by end-use and a break-
down of final and useful energy demand 
in hotels; and
 ● Energy  Efficiency  Demand  Scenario 
without  Interim  Gas  Solution  Scenario 
(SC1):  Demand  factors  for  this  scenario 
are  taken  from  an  energy  efficiency 
scenario  developed  in  a  separate  study 
examining  energy  demand  projections 
(Zachariadis  et  al.  2014).  None  of  the 
 ●
forecasts  of  final  energy  demand  up  to 
the year 2040 for a number of scenarios 
reflecting  different  sets  of  assumptions 
on Cyprus’ economic and energy system 
development.
3
major  projects  under  consideration  are 
implemented,  except  the  production 
of  domestic  natural  gas  for  the  internal 
market  in  2022;  a  transition  period  is 
assumed where indigenous gas for power 
generation  becomes  available  in  2023. 
Specifically, the Interim Gas Solution, the 
EuroAsia  Interconnector  and  the  LNG 
export  terminal  are  excluded  from  this 
scenario.
 ●
LNG Export Terminal Scenario (SC4): In 
this  scenario,  assumptions  are  the  same 
as  in  the  previous  scenario  (SC3),  but 
investment in a liquefaction facility for ex-
port purposes is allowed. Since the inter-
connector is not deployed in this scenario, 
storage  is  again  deemed   necessary  be-
yond certain predefined limits (discussed 
later in section 3.4.6.1).
 ● EuroAsia 
Interconnector  Scenario 
(SC5):  This  scenario  assumes  that  the 
EuroAsia  Interconnector  will  be  imple-
mented  as  planned,  but  no  liquefaction 
facility will be developed. Unless a sepa-
rate grid analysis indicates otherwise, the 
assumption  here  is  that  storage  is  not  a 
prerequisite in the case of high renewable 
energy penetration. The Interim Gas Solu-
tion is assumed to be successful as in SC3. 
Final electricity demands are the same as 
in SC1 and SC3. The aim of this scenario 
is  to  identify  the  price  at  which  impor-
ted electricity becomes cost-competitive 
enough  to  be  part  of  the  Cyprus  power 
generation mix. Since investment cost for 
development of the cable connection has 
not  been  considered  in  the  analysis,  the 
economic  and  other  benefits  from  the 
deployment of the interconnector should 
outweigh  the  cost  of  the  associated  in-
frastructure for the interconnector to add 
value to the electrical system. In the pre-
sence of an interconnector, the impact on 
renewable energy deployment would be 
twofold:  no  storage  would  be  required 
and more variable renewable energy can 
enter the power generation mix without 
the need for storage, which would reduce 
its competitiveness.
 ●
Extra Efficiency Demand Scenario with 
Interim  Gas  Solution  Scenario  (SC2): 
This  scenario  follows  the  same  logic  as 
SC1,  with  the  exception  of  different  final 
electricity demand assumptions and the 
success of the Interim Gas Solution nego-
tiations. Demands are taken from the Ex-
tra Efficiency Scenario (Zachariadis et al. 
2014),  which  also  assumes  a  decoupling 
between economic growth and electricity 
demand. Thus, demand in this scenario is 
lower  than  in  SC1.  Also,  the  interim  gas 
solution  is  allowed  to  make  gas  avail-
able  for  the  power  sector,  which  means 
that a limit is imposed on the maximum 
contribution of renewables in the genera-
tion mix, so as to ensure consumption of 
a minimum volume of gas based on the 
likely minimum quantity requirements to 
be purchased for the Interim Gas Solution 
to happen.
 ● Energy  Efficiency  Scenario  Demand 
with  Interim  Gas  Solution  Scenario 
(SC3):  This  scenario  follows  the  same 
assumptions and final electricity demand 
as SC1. However, the Interim Gas Solution 
negotiations are assumed to be success-
ful, as in the case of SC2. By comparing 
SC1 with SC3, outputs from this scenario 
can provide insights regarding the effects 
of the interim solution.
 ●
LNG  Export  Terminal  and  EuroAsia  In-
terconnector  Scenario  (SC6):  A  combi-
4
nation of Scenarios SC4 and SC5 has been 
conducted, with both the liquefaction fa-
cility  and  the  interconnector  considered. 
Assumptions  regarding  the  Interim  Gas 
Solution are the same as in SC4, while the 
assumptions  regarding  the  necessity  of 
storage are the same as in SC5.
deployment  of  variable  renewable  energy 
(VRE)  generation,  while  maintaining  stable 
operation of the electricity grid, the roadmap 
includes  the  results  of  two  studies  examin-
ing how VRE integration could be supported 
through:
1.  VRE production forecasting
2.  State-of-the-art  of  technologies  for  the 
provision  of  grid  support  services  from 
variable renewable energy systems
Additionally, several sensitivity analyses were 
undertaken.  The  demand  scenarios  consid-
ered in the MESSAGE model were based on 
the  demand  forecast  developed  by  CUT.  In 
particular,  one  demand  scenario  was  used 
for five out of six supply scenarios, with the 
scenario  with  the  lowest  electricity  demand 
used only for evaluating the possible benefits 
in one of the six scenarios (SC2).
These  studies  were  developed  by  IRENA,  as 
defined  in  the  scope  of  work  of  the   Cyprus 
roadmap,  and  are  included  at  the  end  of 
this  report.  They  provide  key  insights  into 
the  state  of  the  art  of  some  key  tools  and 
measures  that  can  be  used  to  facilitate  the 
integration of large shares of VRE into Cyprus’ 
electricity system.
The  modelling  work  using  MESSAGE  was 
developed  together  with  the  Swedish  Royal 
Institute of Technology (KTH) and is detailed 
in  the  full  roadmap  report,  in  the  section 
“Electricity Supply Scenarios for the Republic 
of Cyprus”. This section considers six specific 
scenarios examining the optimal deployment 
of renewable energy and thermal generation 
for the period 2013-2030. The scenarios were 
designed  by  IRENA  and  KTH  in  consulta-
tion with the Ministry of Energy, Commerce, 
Industry  and  Tourism  (MECIT),  to  provide 
insights into key energy related decisions that 
Cyprus is facing. This part of the report forms 
the  core  of  the  roadmap  and  provides  key 
insights  into  how  different  policy  decisions 
affect the optimal evolution of the electricity 
system in Cyprus.
Key roadmap findings
The following conclusions have emerged from 
the roadmap analysis:
 ●
To better position Cyprus for the revision 
of its energy policy and associated plans, 
this report provides quantitative insights 
on the impacts of major upcoming policy 
decisions;
 ●
Several  renewable  energy  technologies 
(RETs), including photovoltaics (PV) and 
wind, can already produce electricity at a 
lower  cost  than  Cyprus’  current  oil-fired 
power plants;
3)  Technical studies investigating 
 ● Based on this analysis, renewable en-
ergy could provide 25% to 40% of Cy-
prus’  total  electricity  supply  in  2030. 
In these scenarios solar PV will be the

the-art information on how to accelerate the

dominant  source  with  about  500  – 
1,000  megawatts  (MW)  of  capa city 
providing 15% to 27% of the electricity 
supply while wind will be the second 
most  important  renewable  energy 
source  with  about  175  –  375  MW  of 
capacity  providing  5%  to  9%  of  the 
electricity supply.
ty that is fed into the grid is sold either 
at  market  price  or  at  a  feed-in  tariff 
below marginal generation cost; and
 ● Maintain the feed-in tariff regime until 
a  well-functioning  market,  which  al-
lows  full  participation  of  renewable 
energy  (including  provision  of  ancil-
lary services), is in place.
 ●
The  deployment  of  renewable  energy  in 
Cyprus  has  the  potential  to  create  be-
tween 11,000 and 22,000 jobs in Cyprus 
by  2030,  based  on  IRENA’s  estimates 
of  the  job-creation  potential  of  different 
RETs;
 ● Certain features of the electricity market 
currently  being  designed  would  affect 
the  competitiveness  of  renewables  and 
should be reconsidered:
 ● Production  forecast  closes  at  3:00 
p.m. of the day before, with no re-de-
nomination allowed on the same day;
 ●
The  accelerated  deployment  of  renewa-
ble energy along with the shift of thermal 
generation to natural gas is estimated to 
lower  generation  cost  to  EUR  83-92  per 
megawatt-hour (MWh) by 2030. Costs in 
2013 were around EUR 130/MWh, based 
primarily  on  heavy  fuel  oil  and  diesel 
generation.
 ● Limited size of the day-ahead market 
due  to  thermal  generation  must-run 
and  operating  reserves  constraints, 
with no incentives to invest in flexibil-
ity or dispatchability;
 ● RETs are not allowed to provide ancil-
lary services through the market, with 
compulsory  requirements  applied  to 
all RETs through grid codes; and
 ●
The  following  recommendations  would 
help  to  minimise  electricity  generation 
costs in Cyprus:
 ● Uncapped and non-compensated RET 
curtailment  justified  by  system  secu-
rity concerns creates a substantial risk 
for renewable energy investors.
 ● Create  market  incentives  for  invest-
ment  in  increasing  the  flexibility  of 
thermal  generation,  to  reduce  must-
run  requirements  and  increase  the 
space  for  integration  of  renewable 
energy into the market;
 ●
To  improve  the  quality  and  reliability  of 
national energy balance it is recommen-
ded to:
 ● Minimise  the  requirements  for  provi-
sion  of  ancillary  services  from  dis-
tributed renewable energy in the grid 
codes and allow renewable energy to 
participate in the market for ancillary 
services;
 ● Publish the annual energy balance of 
Cyprus  and  extend  its  coverage  to 
accommodate  all  available  statistical 
information,  e.g.,  for  industrial  sub-
sectors; and
 ● Move from a net-metering scheme to 
net-billing, where renewable electrici-

tor  (DSO)  while  also  reducing  financial 
risk and increasing revenues of IPPs and 
utilities operating VRE assets.
There  is  substantial  potential  for  ener-
gy  efficiency  improvements  and  further 
pene tration of renewables in the tourism 
sector, provided that appropriate policies 
are implemented.
 ●
 ●
There  is  a  strong  correlation  between 
the  value  of  forecasting  and  electricity 
market  design.  In  particular  short-term 
markets and full market access (i.e., inclu-
ding participation in the ancillary services 
market) for VRE producers increases the 
effectiveness  of  forecasting  in  reducing 
VRE integration costs and increasing the 
share of VRE generation.
 ●
The Ministry of Energy, Commerce, Indus-
try and Tourism should consider making a 
long-term commitment to energy model-
ling  work  for  both  final  energy  demand 
and electricity supply as this would great-
ly expand in-house capacity to assess the 
potential  impacts  of  energy  policy  deci-
sions and changes in the energy market 
conditions.
 ● Current and near term advances in power 
electronics  allow  VRE  assets  to  provide 
grid  support  services  (GSS).  In  combi-
nation  with  limited  amounts  of  energy 
storage,  VRE  can  provide  the  full  range 
of  GSS  already  today.  These  capabilities 
should be factored into Cyprus’ proposed 
market  design  and  future  energy  plan-
ning efforts.
 ● Accurate forecasts support high levels of 
VRE  generation  by  reducing  integration 
costs for the transmission system opera-
tors (TSO) and distribution system opera-

INSIGHTS FOR POLICY MAKERS
This  section  provides  a  review  of  the  main 
findings  and  specific  policy  recommenda-
tions  that  have  emerged  from  the  roadmap 
analysis. It is intended to assist policy makers 
in identifying the main insights that will affect 
important upcoming policy decisions.

the  imminent  end  of  derogations  given 
to  the  electricity  sector  of  Cyprus  with 
respect to the application of EU emission 
limits, particularly according to the Large 
Combustion  Plants  Directive  (Directive 
2001/80/EC  setting  emission  limits  for 
SO2, NOx and dust) and the free alloca-
tion of CO2 certificates;
new  techno-economic  developments, 
particularly  with  respect  to  RETs,  power 
electronics,  smart  and  energy  efficient 
technologies; and
the current economic situation of  Cyprus, 
which  is  seeing  increasing  need  for  re-
duced  energy  costs  in  businesses  and 
households.
Cyprus is at a major crossroad for the deve-
lopment of its energy system. The key driving 
elements for the evolution of Cyprus’ energy 
system are:
 ●
 ●
the  potential  availability  of  natural  gas, 
either imported or indigenous, within this 
decade;
the  plan  to  open  up  the  monopolistic 
electricity market to competition, with a 
view  to  reduce  cost  and  give  choice  to 
consumers;

Figure 2: Development of solar PV capacity under different scenarios
are  based  on  possible  combinations  of  ma-
jor  developments  for  the  energy  system  of 
 Cyprus,  particularly:  availability  of  imported 
gas,  availability  of  an  international  electrical 
interconnection, availability of indigenous gas 
and related infrastructure.
Wind is the second most important RET, con-
tributing  between  5%  and  9%.  The  scenari-
os  on  the  low-end  of  the  renewable  energy 
share  are  limited  in  penetration  of  vari able 
RET  based  on  the  constraints  obtained  by 
the  Ministry  of  Energy,  Commerce,  Industry 
and  Tourism.  The  ministry’s  constraints  are 
based on provisional results from a study on 
grid stability commissioned by CERA, which 
will be revised by a subsequent study under 
development  by  the  Joint  Research  Centre 
(JRC)  of  the  European  Commission.  None-
theless, mandatory renewable energy targets 
for 2020 are exceeded in all scenarios. In the 
absence  of  constraints  related  to  must-run, 
operating  reserve  and  stability-related  con-
cerns,  solar  PV  will  reach  higher  shares  at  a 
steady pace. In the absence of imported gas 
becoming  available  for  power  generation  in 
2016,  solar  PV  deployment  will  be  strongly 
accelerated  (see  SC1  and  Figure  2).  It  is  re-
commended to explore scenarios without the 
availability of natural gas and imposed tech-
nical constraints on variable renewables (cur-
rently based on a non-finalised study).
Figure 1 illustrates a decision tree defining the 
six key scenarios based on the combinations 
of the above energy sector developments.
The  analysis  of  these  scenarios  shows  that 
several RETs can already produce electricity 
at a lower cost than power plants fueled by 
oil products.
RETs  have  the  potential  to  provide  a  sub-
stantial  contribution  to  the  electricity  mix 
of  Cyprus.  Based  on  this  analysis,  between 
25% and 40% of Cyprus’ electricity supply 
can  come  from  renewables  in  2030,  in  the 
economically  optimal  mix.  Solar  PV  is  the 
predominant renewable energy technology in 
all scenarios, supplying between 15% and 27% 
of the electricity consumed in Cyprus in 2030. 
9
Based on an IRENA analysis titled Renewable 
Energy  and  Jobs  (IRENA,  2013c),  solar  PV 
can  provide  18-20  new  jobs  per  additional 
megawatt-peak (MWp) installed, while wind 
in a similar context like Cyprus (e.g., Greece) 
can provide 8.8 jobs per MWp (see table 2.2, 
page 42 of IRENA 2013c). The deployment of 
1 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of PV over the period 
2013-2030  can  lead  to  about  20,000  new 
jobs (see Table 2), with about additional jobs 
still exceeding 10,000 in the scenario with the 
lowest renewable energy deployment (SC2). 
In  the  case  of  Cyprus,  synergies  can  be  lev-
eraged  between  the  existing  solar  thermal 
industry,  which  is  already  well-established, 
and  the  rapidly  growing  solar  PV  market. 
Therefore a dedicated analysis on the job im-
pact for Cyprus would be a valuable extension 
of this work.
This  analysis  provides  insights  for  the  key 
policy decisions that will determine the evolu-
tion of the energy sector in Cyprus. Instead of 
suggesting one pathway as the optimal to fol-
low, different scenarios provide quantitative 
insights  on  the  impacts  of  different  policy 
decisions,  to  better  position  Cyprus  for  the 
revision  of  its  energy  policy  and  associated 
plans  (e.g.,  the  National  Renewable  Energy 
Action  Plan).  Given  the  game-changing  na-
ture  of  some  of  the  policy  decisions  to  be 
taken  for  the  energy  sector  of  Cyprus,  this 
analysis  outlines  an  optimal  roadmap  for 
each of the possible scenarios, without as-
sociating a  probability to each of them. The 
difference among different scenarios in terms 
of cost of generation, investment needs, com-
pliance with policy targets and optimal power 
generation mix can guide the government in 
taking  policy  decisions  that  will  lead  to  the 
most desirable scenario and associated opti-
mal roadmap.

Policy recommendations
In combination, renewables and natural 
gas are  expected to lower the genera-
tion  cost  to  EUR  83-92/MWh  by  2030 
(Table 1). This is compared to 2013 levels 
estimated at about EUR 130 /MWh, where 
power  is  generated  mostly  by  burning 
heavy fuel oil and diesel.
In  order  to  minimise  the  electricity  genera-
tion cost for the Cyprus system, the following 
recommendations can be made.
 ● Create market incentives for investment 
in  flexibility  for  thermal  power  plants, 
to reduce the must-run requirements and

customers equally. Moving to a net-billing 
scheme can promote smarter consump-
tion patterns, lead to the deployment of 
small-scale  storage  systems  and  intel-
ligent appliances, and generally leverage 
all the potential benefits from distributed 
PV. The same policy can replace the ex-
isting  self-generation  support  scheme, 
which has not been very successful up to 
now,  especially  in  agricultural  and  other 
commercial  consumers,  who  are  unable 
to derive benefits from it.
increase the space for integration of RET 
into the market (see the case of Denmark, 
e.g., from Blum and Christensen 2013).
 ● Minimise the requirements for provision 
of  ancillary  services  from  distributed 
RET  (e.g.,  small-scale  residential  PV)  in 
the grid codes, and allow RET to partici-
pate in the market for ancillary services. 
In  this  way,  the  participation  of  only  a 
minimal part of the RET generators would 
be sufficient to compensate for the rest of 
the  variable  RET,  minimising  the  cost  of 
providing  the  needed  ancillary  services 
(see Van Hulle et al. 2014).
 ● According to this analysis, acceleration of 
the deployment of RET can reduce gene-
ration cost substantially, especially under 
the current conditions where oil products 
are used to generate most of the electri-
city. However, the slow permitting process 
slows  down  the  necessary  deployment, 
and current policy and future market un-
certainty  increase  the  risk  for  investors. 
As  PV,  concentrated  solar  power  (CSP) 
and wind are capital-intensive (but have 
no fuel cost), they are much more sensi-
tive to cost of capital compared to ther-
mal  power  plants.  Increasing  the  risk 
for investors in RET would reduce their 
competitiveness much more than would 
be  the  case  for  investors  in  fossil  fuel-
powered  plants,  with  a  double  impact 
on electricity generation cost for Cyprus. 
 ● Consider  moving  from  a  net-metering 
scheme  towards  asymmetric  net-bill-
ing,  where  electricity  fed  into  the  grid 
is purchased either at market price or at 
a  feed-in  tariff  below  marginal  genera-
tion cost. This would allow both a reduc-
tion  of  windfall  profits  for  net  metering 
custo mers  –  due  to  the  large  difference 
 between generation cost from PV and the 
current  tariff  –  as  well  as  the  reduction 
of  grid  integration  costs,  as  a  net-billing 
scheme would provide strong incentives 
for maximising self-consumption of elec-
tricity produced from PV. Currently all net 
metering  customers  pay  a  fixed  fee  for 
grid  use,  a  measure  that  does  not  pro-
mote self-consumption and penalises all 
11
This  means  that  less  RET  deployment 
will  take  place,  with  a  higher  generation 
cost. For each 12 MWp of utility-scale PV 
that gets delayed compared to the sug-
gested  roadmap,  this  analysis  estimates 
that total generation cost will increase by 
EUR  1  million  per  year.  One  suggestion 
could  be  to  maintain  the  feed-in  tariff 
regime  until  a  well-functioning  market 
that  allows  for  full  participation  of  RET, 
including  provision  of  ancillary  services, 
is  in  place.  One  possible  way  to  achieve 
this  is  to  provide  a  feed-in  tariff  set  at 
marginal  generation  cost  minus  grid 
integration cost for as many years as the 
estimated  break-even  time.  This  should 
be revised yearly for new installations, to 
account for reductions in the cost of RET 
and  changes  in  grid  integration  costs; 
however, it should not be revised retro-
actively for existing installations.  Once 
their feed-in period expires, RET genera-
tors will be allowed to sell electricity (and 
services)  on  the  market,  which  by  then 
should be fully operational.
In particular, certain features of the future 
market  currently  being  designed  would 
affect the competitiveness of renewables 
and  likely  slow  down  investments.  Key 
concerns related to current design of the 
electricity market, related to deployment 
of renewables, are:
 ● production 
closes  at 
forecast 
3:00  p.m.  of  the  day  before,  with  no 
re-denomination allowed on the same 
day;
 ● limited size of the day-ahead market 
due  to  conservative  constraints  on 
must-run  for  thermal  power  plants 
and operating reserves, with no incen-
tives to invest in flexibility for reducing 
the must-run requirements;
 ● RET  will  not  be  allowed  to  provide 
ancillary services through the market, 
with  requirements  being  enforced  to 
all RET through grid codes;
 ● RET  can  be  curtailed  without  com-
pensation  if  TSO  requests  to  do  so 
because of system security concerns, 
and no cap is set on max curtailment, 
which  creates  a  substantial  risk  for 
RET investors.
 ● Based  on  the  decision  tree  in  Figure  1, 
no  fuel  switch  will  happen  before  2016, 
in  any  of  the  scenarios.  Therefore,  for 
2015  the  best  policy  option  is  to  create 
the enabling conditions for  accelerated 
deployment  of  utility-scale  solar 
PV,  which  is  the  cheapest  available 
generation  option.  PV  generation  cost 
for  2015  in  Cyprus  is  estimated  to  be 
below  EUR  80/MWh,  displacing  diesel 
and  less  efficient  heavy  fuel  oil  (HFO) 
units,  for  which  the  variable  generation 
cost  (short-run  marginal  cost,  or  SRMC) 
ranges  between  EUR  120-130/MWh. 
However,  due  to  the  current  uncertainty 
on  permitting, 
licensing  and  future 
market  design,  the  environment  in  2015 
is  not  conducive  to  deployment  of  RET. 
 ● One  of  the  major  achievements  in  the 
development of this analysis has been the 
creation of a platform for productive dis-
cussions  among  key  stakeholders  in  the 
energy sector of Cyprus. The added value 
of having a modelling platform to support 
discussions on quantitative results should 
justify  support  for  creating  in-house  ca-
pacity  on  energy  planning  modelling.  In 
this  way  future  policy  development  will 
benefit  from  quantitative-based  discus-
sions  supported  by  a  commonly  agreed 
modelling platform, which can provide in-
sights on impacts from different policies 
being  considered,  and  assess  sensitivity 
of results to specific assumptions used.
