A. Scope and Purpose
 ◎ The Energy Master Plan is a comprehensive plan that covers all energy sectors, and 
systematically links and coordinates energy related plans from a macro perspective.
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
3
*  As  an  overarching  plan,  it  presents  principles  and  directions  for  energy-related  plans 
source-by-source and sector-by-sector.
 
 ◎ The main purpose of the plan is to provide a fundamental philosophy and vision for mid- to long-
term energy policy while suggesting major targets to help realize these ends.  
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
4
B. Relation to Sub-Plans
 
 ◎ As a master plan, it contains a long-term perspective rather than detailed objectives. It is also 
scheduled to apply for a relatively long period of time (five years), and hence it cannot easily 
be adjusted in response to changes in the policy environment.
•  As a result, excessive restrictions on sub-plans could worsen distortions caused by energy 
C
h
a
p
t
e
r

policies.
 
 ◎ Sub-plans will therefore be independently designed to reflect changing conditions and 
the particular needs and objectives of each plan while complying with the Master Plan’s 
fundamental philosophy and principles.
 ◎ Additionally, compatibility will be ensured as much as possible both between individual sub-
C

a
p
t
e
r

OUTLINE OF THE ENERGY MASTER PLAN AND 
ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRST ENERGY MASTER PLAN
C. Process for Establishment
 ◎ Due  to  the  increasing  complexity  of  energy  policies  and  growing  conflicts  among 
stakeholders, it is essential to actively involve the private sector in the establishment of the 
Master Plan.
 ◎ A channel is needed for civic groups and experts to participate from the initial stage. The plan 
must be confirmed by the National Energy Committee and Committee on Green Growth, 
which are composed of the public and private sector.
3. Changing Direction of Energy Policy
Until the 1990s
 ◎ The major policy objective was to secure a stable and affordable supply of energy needed for 
economic growth, daily life, and industrial production.
•  The energy sector was dominated by public monopolies, and energy prices* were directly 
regulated by the government, with a priority on achieving rapid economic growth.
*  In the case of petroleum products, oil prices were liberalized in 1997. However, prices continued to be 
regulated for electricity, gas, heat, etc.
In the Early 2000s
 ◎ The government promoted competition in the energy industry through measures such as 
structural reform of the power industry.
•  The government allowed the market to decide energy supply and demand and energy prices, 
with a focus on keeping both government intervention and market failures to a minimum.
Until the First Energy Master Plan (2008)
 ◎ The  main  objective  of  mid-  to  long-term  energy  policy  was  to  achieve  sustainable 
development,  simultaneously  considering  energy  security,  economic  growth,  and 
environmental impact.
*  "3 Es" of Energy Policy: Energy Security, Efficiency, and Environment
•  Amid world-wide efforts to respond to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions reduction 
emerged as a major issue for energy policy.

B. Overall Assessment
 
 ◎ The core policy objective in the First Energy Master Plan was “Low-Carbon Green Growth."
•  The plan was aimed at maximizing the use of nuclear and renewable energy and dramatically 
reducing energy intensity by curbing demand, while at the same time creating a new growth 
engine by developing green technologies.
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
5
•  The First Energy Master Plan has provided the basis for a variety of measures aimed at 
achieving green growth since 2008, including enacting basic laws, establishing committees, 
and setting a national greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction target.*
 
*  GHG reduction target of 30% from business-as-usual (BAU) by 2020
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
6
 ◎ Previous energy policies focused on one primary purpose, the affordable and stable supply of 
power, to support economic growth and industrialization.
 
•  The First Energy Master Plan pursued sustainability in the energy industry and presented 
a new and advanced paradigm for creating a new growth engine through green technologies.
9
OUTLINE OF THE ENERGY MASTER PLAN AND 
ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRST ENERGY MASTER PLAN
 ◎ Significant growth in the size of the renewable and nuclear industries brought about a green 
industry renaissance.
*  For renewables, between 2007 and 2011, the number of enterprises in the market increased two 
times, the number of employees four times, the volume of sales eight times, and the volume of 
exports and amount of private investment seven times.
 ◎  In 2012, the final energy consumption growth rate surpassed the projection of the First 
Energy Master Plan by 3.3%. 
(If the trend continues, the gap between the actual growth rate and the projection will reach 
13.3% by 2030.)
 ◎ The electrification of energy consumption, in which demand is focused on electricity due to 
low electricity rates, destabilized the power supply-demand balance. 
•  More and more generation facilities have been constructed to meet growing demand, but this 
resulted in negative effects, such as increased GHG emissions, an overloaded transmission 
network and opposition from local residents.
 ◎ Overseas resources development, which was led mainly by public enterprises with a narrow 
focus on quantitative growth, resulted in increased debt without sufficiently improving 
development capability.
*  "3 Es" of Energy Policy: Energy Security, Efficiency, and Environment 
C. Assessment of Main Tasks
Energy Mix
 ◎ Key points: Maximize* the use of nuclear energy, which has both environmental benefits, such as 
CO2 reduction, and economic benefits. 
*  Targeting 41% of total installed capacity and 59% of total power generation by 2030.
•  Expand renewable energy to 11% of primary energy consumption by 2030 through various 
measures, including the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and the One Million Green 
Home project.
 ◎ Areas for improvement: The energy mix proposed in the plan emphasized both GHG 
reduction and economic efficiency. However, it was insufficiently comprehensive in terms of 
considering such factors as feasibility*, public acceptance, power grid conditions, and safety.
*  Renewable energy: potential after considering geographical/technological conditions, environmental 
regulations, etc.; nuclear energy: load-following capacity, etc.

*  Energy intensity (TOE/1,000$): 0.347 in 2006 → 0.233 in 2020 → 0.185 in 2030 
 
 ◎ Forecast vs actual consumption: Total energy consumption in Korea has increased faster 
than forecasted in the First Energy Master Plan for last five years (2007~2012).
 ◎ Energy consumption in the industrial sector has been increasing faster than forecasted, 
while the trend is less pronounced in the transportation, household and commercial sectors.

OUTLINE OF THE ENERGY MASTER PLAN AND 
ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRST ENERGY MASTER PLAN
 ◎ Areas for improvement:  Precise demand forecasting, effective demand management, and 
policies for pricing and technology development/deployment are needed.
Power Supply and Demand
 ◎ Key points: Reduce electricity demand by 7.6% by 2020 and 12.4% by 2030.
 ◎ Forecast vs actual consumption: Electricity demand as of 2012 was over 9% higher than 
forecasted, accounting for almost 20% of final energy consumption.
*  Share of electricity in final energy consumption: 17.5% in 2007 → 19.3% in 2012
•  Low electricity prices resulted in increased consumption as people switched to electricity 
from other energy sources.
*  Following price liberalization, the price of petroleum products soared due to high oil prices. However, 
the increase in electricity rates was kept to a minimum out of consideration for consumer prices.

Background to the Implementation of 
the Second Energy Master Plan
1. Current Energy Consumption
A. Consumption by Sector
 ◎ The average annual growth rate (AAGR) of final energy consumption from 2000 to 2012 
was 2.8%.
*  The AAGR, which was 7.2% in the 1990s, slowed considerably after the Asian financial crisis.
 ◎ The share of energy consumed in the industrial sector has been steadily increasing and 
currently exceeds 60% of final energy consumption.
*  The shares of the household, commercial, public and transportation sectors have steadily decreased.
 ◎ Feedstock, such as naphtha and coking coal, accounts for more than half of energy 
consumption in the industrial sector and more than 35% of total final energy consumption. 
*  If consumption of feedstock is excluded, the AAGR of final energy consumption decreases by 0.6% 
percentage points to 2.2%.  
Energy used as feedstock was the largest contributor to the increase in energy consumption. 
Industrial energy consumption soared throughout the recovery from the 2010 financial crisis.

BACKGROUND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE SECOND ENERGY MASTER PLAN
 ◎ Electricity: The share of electricity increased from 10.8% in 1990 to 19.3% in 2012, and 
electricity consumption increased rapidly at an AAGR of 5.7% from 2000.
•  Low electricity prices compared to other energy sources, along with convenience of use, 
accelerated the electrification of energy consumption.
 ◎ City Gas: Consumption of city gas increased very rapidly at an AAGR of 30.5% in the 1990s, 
but this increase slowed to an AAGR of 5.9% after 2000 due to saturation of infrastructure.
*  AAGR by sector (from 2000): industry 9.3%, household/commerce 3.6%
 ◎ Coal: The share of coal remained in the 13% range in the 2000s before increasing to 15.4% in 
2012 due to recent rise in industrial consumption.
*  The share of bituminous coal in total coal consumption, which was 50.4% in 1990, increased sharply 
to 91.8% in 2012 due to a decrease in anthracite coal consumption and an increase in the use of 
bituminous coal for power generation.
2. Global Conditions
A. Global Energy Demand Forecast
 ◎ Global energy demand is forecasted to increase by 48.3% between 2010 and 2035 on the back 
of economic and population growth in developing countries, and GHG emissions are expected 
to increase by 40.2%.
•  Total energy demand will increase by 0.5% annually on average in OECD countries and 2.3% 
in non-OECD countries.
 ◎ By energy source, nuclear and renewable energy will experience the fastest growth with an 
AAGR of 2.7%.
*  Among fossil fuels, natural gas will see the largest increase as a result of the distribution and 
expanded production of shale gas.

 ■Non-OECD countries will lead the growth in global energy demand. The share of fossil fuels 
in energy demand will decrease from 84% in 2010 to 79% in 2035 despite increased use of

B. Continued High Oil Prices
 
 ◎ Global oil prices, which averaged $94.3/bbl* in 2008, fell in 2009 following the financial crisis 
before rebounding to a record high of $124/bbl in 2012.

BACKGROUND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE SECOND ENERGY MASTER PLAN
Past
New Era of High Oil Prices
·   Supply-side instability in the Middle East and 
other regions
· Demand growth from emerging countries 
· Increasing marginal cost of production
Cause 
Price 
Recovery
·   Prices return to previous levels when 
conditions normalize
· Oil prices remain high
 ■A steady increase in fossil fuel prices will have a large negative impact on the entire Korean 
economy, which is highly dependent on imports.
 ■However, continued high oil prices will accelerate the development of alternative energy and 
improvements in energy efficiency.
C. Expanded Development of Unconventional Energy Sources
 ◎ The development of unconventional energy sources, such as shale gas and tight oil, will 
change the landscape of the energy market.
*  Unconventional gas will account for 48% of the growth in gas production by 2035. The US, which 
currently imports 20% of its energy, will achieve energy self-sufficiency by 2020.
 ■Regions with shale gas resources, such as China, Europe, and the US, will replace the Middle 
East and Russia, which are the largest exporters of traditional gas, as the dominant players in 
the natural gas market. 
 ■The markets for natural gas substitutes, such as coal and oil, are also highly likely to be affected.

D. Changes in Nuclear Energy Policy After the Fukushima Nuclear Accident
 ◎ In the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear accident on March 11, 2011, several countries, 
including Germany and Switzerland, announced plans to shut down their nuclear power 
plants in operation.

 ◎ Japan decided to phase out nuclear energy by 2030 after soliciting public comments on three 
scenarios for nuclear energy use.
*  The decision was later put on hold in the face of opposition from the industry and allies, such as the 
C
h

US, and it was effectively reversed after the new government took office.
 
 ◎ Some countries are turning back to nuclear energy, including the UK, which announced plans 
to construct a new nuclear power plant for the first time in 20 years.
•  The Nuclear Regulatory Authority of Japan announced new safety regulations on July 8,
2013, and plans to restart the operation of nuclear power plants after confirming their safety
under the new regulations.

BACKGROUND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE SECOND ENERGY MASTER PLAN
E. Negotiations on New Post-2020 Climate Regime
 ◎ The Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Advanced Action (ADP) aims to 
conclude negotiations on a new post-2020 global climate framework that is applicable to all 
nations by the end of 2015.
*  Whereas the Kyoto Protocol of 2008 to 2020 called for mandatory GHG reduction by developed nations 
and voluntary GHG reduction efforts by developing nations, the new post-2020 climate regime will be 
a single climate regime applicable to all participating nations.
 ◎ The recent 19th session of the Conference of Parties (COP 19) developed a concrete work 
plan for conducting negotiations on the new post-2020 climate regime through the end of 
2015.
•  The parties agreed to come forward with their intended national contributions to post-2020 
global GHG emissions reduction by 2015.
 ■Persistent disagreements between developed and developing countries as well as global 
economic uncertainty have weakened the momentum for negotiations compared to the period of 
the First Energy Master Plan.
 ■The establishment of a new post-2020 climate regime applicable to both developed and 
developing nations is likely to put increased pressure on Korea.
F. Restructuring of the Renewable Energy Industry
 ◎ The renewable energy industry is going through a period of rapid restructuring due to a 
sluggish global economy and an overabundance of solar PV and wind power manufacturers.
*  Reduction of the number of solar PV companies and production capacity between 2011 and 2013: 
Europe (25 companies, 2,400 MW), US (15 companies, 1,200 MW), Korea & China (200 companies, 3,200 
MW).
 ◎ Accelerated technology development has continually driven down the generation costs of 
renewable energy.
*   Unit costs of generation:  (wind  power)  $200/MWh  in  2010  →  $100/MWh  by  the  end  of  2012; 
(solar PV) $315/MWh in 2010 → $166/MWh by the end of 2012
 ■Although the renewable energy industry is going through period of stagnation and restructuring in 
the short-term, technology competition is likely to lead to considerable growth in the mid- to long-
term.

3. Domestic Conditions
A. Deteriorating Conditions for Power Supply & Demand
 ◎ Low electricity prices have led to a sharp increase in the electricity demand of the industrial 
sector and in demand for cooling and heating.
*   From 2008 to 2012, electricity consumption in the industrial sector grew by 6.4% annually on average, 
making it the largest contributor to the increase in total electricity consumption. Due to a decrease in 
the relative price of electricity, electricity used for heating accounted for 25% of peak demand.

 ◎  The issue of electricity demand and supply should be addressed by controlling industrial 
demand, spreading an energy saving culture, and using decentralized generation.
B. Growing Demand for Nuclear Safety
 ◎  The Fukushima nuclear accident has heightened public concerns about nuclear safety.
•   Despite moves to strengthen nuclear safety standards, including the establishment of a 
Nuclear Safety and Security Commission, corruption scandals involving suppliers have led 
to increased calls for reform of the safety management and overall culture of the nuclear 
industry.
 ◎  Plans for the construction of new nuclear power plants were put on hold in the 6th Basic Plan 
for Long-term Electricity Supply and Demand. 
C. Deteriorating Power Transmission Conditions
 ◎ Although the transmission network was expanded to prepare for the construction of new 
power plants, the difference between the location of generation sites and areas of high 
demand has caused transmission lines to the Seoul metropolitan area to be become 
overloaded.
24

 ◎  The centralized power system is facing limitations due to local opposition to the construction 
of ultra-high-voltage transmission lines.

emissions have been strengthened. 
 
•  In 2009, the government set a national GHG emissions reduction target of 30% below BAU 
levels by 2020.
*   An emissions trading system (ETS) will be introduced as part of efforts to achieve the GHG emissions 
reduction target.  
C

CHAPTER III
Basic Direction of the Second Energy 
Master Plan
1. Drawbacks of the Current Energy Policy
A. Inefficient Resource Distribution
 ◎ A low-price policy motivated by social and economic concerns has reinforced energy 
overconsumption patterns and accelerated the trend toward disproportionate use of certain 
types of energy, such as electricity.

•  In particular, the electrification of energy consumption is causing serious problems.
 ■Significant energy loss (63%) takes place during the production process
(generation, transmission, etc.).
* 2.74 TOE of energy input is needed to produce 1 TOE of electricity.
 ■While a stable supply of other energy sources can be maintained by stockpiling and imports, a 
sudden increase in demand for electricity may result in a supply-demand imbalance if the supply 
infrastructure is insufficient. 
 ■An expansion of generation facilities could cause environmental degradation,  overload the 
transmission network, and provoke a backlash from local residents.
•  Low electricity prices are also a significant obstacle to the creation of new markets in less 
economical areas, such as renewable energy and smart grid.
 ◎ The current energy mix is based on economic feasibility without giving sufficient consideration 
to external effects.
28
KOREA  ENERGY MASTER PLAN
•  There should be a reassessment of external effects, such as environmental pollution caused 
by nuclear and coal-fired plants, public safety concerns, opposition from local residents, etc.
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
I
B. Policies Centered on Supply and Quantitative Growth
 
 ◎ In  place  of  aggressive  measures  to  curb  demand,  large-scale,  centralized  supply 
infrastructure (the unified power grid) was expanded to meet growing demand.
•  An  expanded  power  grid,  larger  power  generating  complexes,  and  supply-demand 
imbalance in the Seoul metropolitan area have led to deteriorating operating conditions in 
the power grid and transmission network.
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
2
 
 ◎ A narrow focus on efficiency during the rapid growth of the nuclear industry had unintended 
consequences:
•  The goal of achieving rapid “nuclear self-sufficiency*” resulted in decreased transparency 
within the industry, while little attention was given to investment in safety and improving the 
safety regulation system.**

** The Ministry of Education and Science and Technology was previously in charge of nuclear safety 
regulation. An independent regulatory body, the Nuclear Safety and Security Committee, was 
established in October 2011 following the Fukushima accident.
C

C. Result-Oriented Policy Goals
 
 ◎ New power plant construction was kept to a minimum while ambitious demand management 
targets were set to achieve the policy goal of sustainable development.
*  The 3rd Basic Plan for Long-term Electricity Supply and Demand attracted criticism about over-
investment in generation facilities due to the high power reserve ratio (18.4% in 2003).
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
5
 ◎ Overseas resources development, which was led mainly by public enterprises with a narrow 
focus on quantitative growth, resulted in increased debt without sufficiently improving 
development capability.
 
 ◎ As the current deployment rate of renewable energy is a mere 2.75% (85% of the target of 
the first plan), reconsideration of the deployment target and detailed measures to achieve the 
target are needed.
C

*  It has been pointed out that the First Energy Master Plan did not include practical measures, such as 
funding mechanisms, to achieve the deployment target of 11%.

(Environmental Protection, Improved Safety, and Technology Development)
 ◎ Strengthen climate change response: Apply GHG reduction technologies, such as USC and 
CCS, to thermal power plants as soon as they are available
*  Applying USC to an aged power plant decreases GHG emissions by approximately 10% and raises 
efficiency approximately 4 percentage points. 
 ◎ Improve safety: Prioritize safety in the operation of nuclear power plants by expanding 
investment, improving management of aged plants, and fostering planned and preventive 
inspections to enhance nuclear safety on a large scale
*  Continuous development of nuclear safety technologies to improve nuclear safety, stress tests for 
plants with extended lives, proactive maintenance of equipment in use for long periods of time, and 
extension of preventive inspection periods and its application
 ◎ Promote innovation in the nuclear industry: Revise relevant systems and consolidate 
operational systems to introduce observation, monitoring, openness, and competition into 
the value chain of the nuclear industry
*  Enact laws on nuclear regulation and supervision and form a government panel for the integrated 
administration of public nuclear facilities
 ◎ Develop energy technology: Promote the development of key technologies to support 
stronger demand management, the expansion of distributed generation, etc.
D. Enhance Energy Security to Escape From Energy Isolation
 ◎ Build capacity for overseas resource development: Reorient public enterprises toward high-
risk areas and long-term investment, while private enterprises focus on areas with high 
market potential.
*  Shift the focus of public enterprises from M&As and share purchases to  exploration and development 
activities and operating rights, expand support to encourage private investment and entrance into 
related industries, such as plant construction.
 ◎ Renewable energy deployment: Raise the renewable energy deployment rate to 11% by 2035 
by extending deployment policies currently applied to electricity* to heat and transportation 
and by implementing a private sector-driven deployment system**.
*  The RHO and the RFS systems, which are similar to the RPS in the electricity sector, will be 
introduced in the heat and transportation sectors respectively.
** Introduce a photovoltaic rental business; provide incentives for projects invested in by local residents 
and with benefit-sharing mechanisms; etc.

CHAPTER IV
Establishment Process for the 
Second Energy Master Plan
1. Public-Private Working Groups
A. Background
 ◎ During the drafting of the First Energy Master Plan, the National Energy Committee was 
formed as a deliberative and decision-making body by representatives of the public and 
private sectors. The opinions of interested parties were collected through public hearings 
and discussions.
*  National Energy Committee: (8 members including the president, the prime minister, and heads 
of related institutions) + (11 members including industrial, academic and research professionals), 
(5 members recommended by civic groups) - total 24 members.
 ◎ Since that time, increasing energy-related controversies have made it all the more crucial to 
reach reasonable and amicable agreement during the establishment and implementation of 
energy policies.
 ◎ Therefore, whereas the collection of public opinion on the First Energy Master Plan took 
place in the final stages of planning as a matter of formality, the Second Energy Master Plan 
was designed to reflect the views of the public from the very beginning through the formation 
of public-private working groups.
•  Five working groups were formed from the draft plan stage by 60 interested participants 
from industry, academia and civic groups. 
[  Main Discussion Topics of Working Groups  ]
•   Direction and coordination of four working groups on demand/electricity/nuclear energy/

CHAPTER IV
Energy Demand Forecast, Targets, 
and the Energy Mix
1. Main Factors in the 2035 Forecast
A. Economic Growth Rate 
 ◎ Figure: The economy is expected to grow by 2.8% annually on average from 2011 to 2035.
*  * Annual average growth rate: 6.5% from 1990 to 2000, 4.2% from 2000 to 2011 
 ◎  Method: The Korea Development Institute (KDI) produced the long-term economic forecast 
using the production function approach*.
*  To calculate projected GDP growth, past GDP growth is divided into contributions from production 
factors, including labor, capital and total factor productivity. Forecasts for each factor are then added 
up to predict future economic growth.
B. Population and Households 
 ◎ Figure: The population will grow by 0.17% annually on average from 2011 to 2035 and is 
likely to decrease after 2030. The number of households will increase by 0.96% annually on 
average during the same period due to a larger share of single-person households.
•  Increasing energy consumption in the residential sector is partly attributable to the rising 
number of single-person households.
*  Single-person households: 24.7% in 2011 → 29.6% in 2020 → 32.7% in 2030 → 34.3% in 2035
 ◎ Method: Statistics Korea (KOSTAT) forecasted growth in population and households on 
the basis of the results of its population and household forecasts, which reflect the 2010 
Population and Housing Census.
C. Global Oil Prices
 ◎ Figure: The price of Dubai crude oil will rise by 1.2% annually on average from 2011 to 2035, 
reaching $140/bbl by 2035. 
 ◎ Method: The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted the oil price growth rate using the 
average growth rate of imported oil prices as published in its World Energy Outlook 2012.

•  Electricity demand growth is mainly attributable to increased investment in infrastructure 
as well as increased production by iron and steel manufacturers, petrochemical businesses, 
and fabricated metal product businesses whose global competitiveness increased during the 
recovery from the international financial crisis. 
•  Low electricity prices have encouraged fuel switching from energy sources, such as oil and 
gas, to electricity.

needed to replace the excessive use of thermal power and other forms of energy.
C

 ◎ The decreased use of nuclear energy and the rising share of coal and LNG in the energy mix 
could bring a risk of greater exposure to global fuel price fluctuations.

ENERGY DEMAND FORECAST, 
TARGETS, AND THE ENERGY MIX
Examples of the Importance of Energy Security 
■   CaseⅠ: At the time of the second oil crisis in 1979, 71% of generation facilities used oil 
as fuel. As oil import prices tripled, electricity rates also rose more than three times 
from 22 won/kWh to 70 won/kWh.
■   CaseⅡ: Following the shutdown of nuclear power plants in Japan, Japan's LNG 
imports sharply increased, turning a trade balance into a trade deficit (6.6 trillion yen in 
2010 → -7.7 trillion yen in 2013).
Economic Feasibility 
 ◎ High prices of oil and other fossil fuels place a heavy burden on the entire economy. The 
generation cost of nuclear energy is lower than other energy sources because it is relatively 
unaffected by oil prices.

 ◎ A high share of nuclear energy is a common feature of energy-poor countries.
•  Before the Fukushima accident, France supplied 78.7% of its electricity from nuclear energy, 
while Japan supplied 29%, Germany 29%, and Korea 34%. 
 ◎ There are clear differences between the situation of Korea and that other energy-poor 
countries.
•  In the case of Japan, Germany and France, the need for massive infrastructure investment is 
lower than Korea as their energy consumption is decreasing or not significantly increasing.
-   Policy change on the energy mix is relatively easier in Japan and Germany since their energy 
consumption has been steadily decreasing with their reserve ratios reaching 38.5% and 96.4% 
respectively as of 2010.

D. Conclusions on the Share of Nuclear Energy

energy up to the minimum load point in order to maximize the use of low-carbon 
nuclear energy (41% of total installed capacity).
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
5
■   The Working Group on Nuclear Energy recommended a downward revision of the 
nuclear energy share from 41% in the First Plan to 22%~29% in view of changed 
conditions in electricity demand, public acceptance and grid stability. 
 
■   At the moment, however, there are no energy sources that can replace the role of 
nuclear energy in terms of energy security, industrial competitiveness and GHG 
reduction, especially since Korea imports nearly all of its energy.
C
h
a
p
t
e

■   As a drastic reduction in the use of nuclear energy is not desirable at this point, a share 
of 29% was chosen on the basis of the working group’ recommendations.

ENERGY DEMAND FORECAST, 
TARGETS, AND THE ENERGY MIX
Nuclear Power Plants
■   A total of 43 GW of installed capacity is required to raise the share of nuclear energy to

 •   As the 6th Basic Plan for Long-term Electricity Supply and Demand already confirmed 
the construction and operation of nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 36 GW 
by 2024, additional facilities with a capacity of 7 GW should be constructed.

 ◎ Gradually improve the progressive scheme for households to reflect changes in household 
 
power consumption patterns
•  Household consumption has increased due to the spread of home appliances, abnormal 
weather conditions, such as heat and cold waves, etc.

 ◎ Changes in household composition, such as a growing number of one- and two- member 
 
families, have reduced the value of the progressive scheme for benefiting energy poor.

 ◎ Develop and apply various opt-in pricing schemes to promote reasonable power consumption 
and reflect power supply and demand, individual consumption patterns, etc.
 
•  Develop a variety of hourly-tiered pricing schemes to encourage users to invest in demand 
side management for peak reduction using private generators, ESS, etc.
59
SIX MAJOR TASKS
1. Transition to Demand Management Policies
•  Instead of forced power savings, apply incentive pricing to add surcharges at certain peak 
hours in summer and winter and to lower prices at other times
 
 ◎ In the mid- to long-term, review a variety of opt-in pricing schemes, including contract pricing 
between consumers and operators* and tiered pricing based on power supply quality**.
*  e.g. Adopt a pricing system based on the introduction of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), and 
provide various value-added services such as electricity use tracking, device control, etc.
** e.g. Premium (high price) rates guarantee minimal blackout hours, high-quality voltage, and 
compensation for damage cause by blackouts
④ Improvement of Use-Based Pricing Scheme
 ◎ Simplify the use-based pricing scheme to minimize pricing differences between different 
types of use
*  Power for homes, street lights, and night-time use has different load characteristics and so should 
continue to be priced separately.
•  Phase in tiered pricing by voltage to reflect different production costs, while using seasonally/
hourly tiered tariffs, opt-in tariffs, and others to appropriately reflect differences in load 
factor (i.e., average load divided by peak load), load patterns, etc.

SIX MAJOR TASKS
1. Transition to Demand Management Policies
Case of technology diffusion in the US
■   The US has applied the Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (EERS) to energy 
suppliers since the 1990s when it hit the limit in expanding supply facilities.
■   Energy suppliers have worked with demand management companies to identify 
demand management resources, resulting in the formation of an ICT-based technology 
market.
 ◎ Priority has been placed on load management projects aimed at shifting the time of energy 
use to off-peak hours in times of supply shortage rather than improving energy efficiency by 
fundamentally reducing energy demand.

B. Direction
 ◎ Transition to fundamental and systematic demand side management using ICT, science, and 
technology rather than temporary consumption regulations, such as indoor temperature 
limits
•  Deploy demand management as a new growth industry by removing regulations and 
improving systems to enhance the added value of applying ICT, such as ESS and EMS
•  Employ integrated resource planning that reflects not only supply resources but also 
demand management resources when devising  supply and demand plans for each energy 
source
 ◎ Create a demand management market so that demand side management can be measured 
and understood as a resource and therefore treated in the same way as supply resources in 
the energy market
•  Improve current systems to allow a choice between demand resources and supply resources 
based on comparison of their economic values
*  US: demand management (1.7cents/kWh) 〈 supply cost (10cents/kWh), Demand management 
outweighs supply cost.
62
KOREA  ENERGY MASTER PLAN
 ◎ Encourage the entrance of various demand management businesses* to the market
*  Not only conventional energy companies but also electronic, communications, secondary battery, 
software companies and others should be nurtured as demand management business.

SIX MAJOR TASKS
2. Establishment of a Distributed Generation System
 ◎ Share best practices and study measures such as technology support and grant support 
aimed at improving the economic feasibility of generators by recycling waste heat and by-
product gas
Best practices of POSCO
■   70% of POSCO's power consumption needs are met by in-house/private generation 
(2.90 GW, equivalent to 3 nuclear reactors).
■   POSCO uses waste heat and by-product gas as a main fuel. Additionally, it has adopted 
high-efficiency LNG combined generation using by-product gas and other fuels in 
addition to LNG since 2000.
② Promotion of Integrated Energy
 ◎ Review possible reforms of energy pricing, taxation and subsidies with a view to improving 
the profitability of integrated energy supply and the fair treatment of energy sources
 ◎ When granting permits, give preference to larger-scale projects involving more than 
50,000~100,000 households and more than 100MW in order to achieve economies of scale
•  Strengthen evaluation of measures to diversify business, such as ensuring low price heat 
sources, developing district cooling supply plans and cooperating with local operators
 ◎ To improve economic feasibility during summer, commercialize desiccant cooling, which 
is suited to apartment complexes, and expand the number of buildings targeted for the 
adoption of district cooling (e.g. larger than 3,000㎡→ larger than 1,000㎡)
③ Promotion of distributed renewable energy
 ◎ Promote projects for small-scale energy distribution to meet the daily energy demand of 
homes, villages, schools and others with renewable energy   
•  Introduce a photovoltaic rental business to provide one-stop service to help anyone easily 
install and maintain such devices
*  Existing government-led initiative: Consumers pay for the 50% of the initial investment, and a 
subsidized 3-year warranty is provided over the 20-year product life.  
•  Create a renewable energy complex by designating certain areas to receive support for a 
total package of solar PV, wind power and ESSs  (Currently, support is provided for individual 
energy sources.)

2. Establishment of a Distributed Generation System
B. Main Tasks
① Enhancement of Acceptance When Constructing New Transmission Lines
 ◎ When the construction of extra high voltage transmission lines is unavoidable, carry out 
complementary measures, such as burying HVDC lines underground
*  HVDC lines are more socially acceptable as they have no distance restrictions, deliver power over 
long distances with underground cables, and emit few electromagnetic waves. However, Korea lacks 
practical experience in this area.
•  Establish grid control and operation strategies that are appropriate for the features of HVDC 
and achieving self-reliance in HVDC technology
 ◎ Commence the construction of transmission lines only after giving full consideration to the 
opinions of local residents at every stage, from selecting routes to finalizing construction 
plans
② Stable Operation of Transmission Lines in the Metropolitan Area
 ◎ There has been a gradual rise in grid instability, including an increased possibility of fault 
currents, as the power load is concentrated in the Seoul metropolitan area, which has a loop-
type transmission grid
 ◎ Continuously  retrofit  the  grid  to  ensure  the  stable  operation  of  transmission  lines. 
Additionally, in the mid- to long-term, consider reconfiguring the loop-type grid, introducing 
a load-dispersing pricing scheme, etc.
•  For the short-term, take measures to retrofit facilities, such as installing reactors and 
increasing breaker capacity, to reduce faults
•  For the mid- to long-term, review the possibility of dividing the Seoul metropolitan area into 
small, alternate current network areas and to link with BTB HVDC
•  Review possible pricing schemes to disperse the demand in the metropolitan area and 
others for the mid- to long- term
③ Improvement of the grid reliability management structure
 ◎ Establish a specialized body dedicated to impartially managing and supervising the national 
grid along the lines of the US NERC
80

and market promotion using cutting-edge technology
In the Past
New Policy Paradigm
Design cost-effective measures to achieve targets 
and strengthen industrial competitiveness 
Set GHG reduction targets
Regulation-oriented GHG 
reduction
Technology and market-oriented GHG reduction
A. Progress
 ◎ Introduction of regulations: The institutional basis has been laid for reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions by establishing the Greenhouse Gas and Energy Target Scheme (implemented in 
2012) and Emissions Trading Scheme (enacted in 2012).
*  The national emissions reduction target was announced in November 2009: 30% below the BAU level 
by 2020.
 ◎ Creation of a carbon market: A voluntary carbon market (Korea Voluntary Emission 
Reduction Program (KVER)) has been operated since 2005. Korea will also launch a national 
emissions trading market (allocation market), the 4th of its kind in the world, in 2015.  
*  KVER: The government pays for greenhouse gas emissions reduction achieved by companies 
participating in the target scheme without reduction obligations.
** ① EU (2005), ② New Zealand (2008), ③ Australia (2015, considering an early launch in 2014)
B. Limitations
 ◎ Increase in GHG emissions: Despite reduction efforts, greenhouse gas emissions have been 
steadily rising due to the prevalence of energy-intensive companies, the export-oriented 
industrial structure, etc.
*  Greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 increased by 9.8% compared to the previous year. Energy 
consumption from 2010 to 2012 was also greater than initially forecasted, and greenhouse gas 
emissions continue to rise.  
*  GHG Intensity (tCO2/million won): (2007)0.617 → (2010)0.641 → (2011)0.643

 ◎ Impact on businesses: There is a need to prepare sufficient counter-measures as the 
introduction of the emissions trading scheme and other measures may undermine business 
competitiveness.

*  Business competitiveness may be weakened as the GHG emission permits to be allocated from 2015 
 
may lead to increase in production costs, reduction in sales, etc.

 ■A survey released in January 2012 showed that more than 80% of companies lacked methods to 
 
reduce emissions sufficiently.  
 ■Methods for achieving emissions targets are mostly aimed at improving the efficiency of 
processes and facilities, doing little to reduce emissions in the long term. (2012: 71%, 2013: 73%).

SIX MAJOR TASKSS
3. Improvement of Sustainability of Energy Policy
 ◎ Creation of a virtuous cycle with economic growth: Review a variety of potential measures 
to ease the concerns of businesses about a loss of competitiveness and carbon leakage as a 
result of the introduction of the Emissions Trading Scheme
 ■Energy-intensive and export-oriented industries (e.g., carbon-leakage industries) need to take 
measures to prevent carbon emissions and job leakage.
 ■ETS compensation program: Review measures to help carbon-intensive industries avoid a loss 
of competitiveness, such as carbon leakage
 ◎ Promotion of an offset market: Design offset programs to help industry achieve cost-effective 
reduction of GHG emissions in the ETS
 ■Review the use of green credits in the domestic offset market, which can be earned from the 
Korea Voluntary Emission Reduction Program, renewable and energy efficiency projects and 
other projects
 ■Encourage small-scale emitters, such as companies with reduction obligations,  to implement 
offset projects
 ◎ International response: Actively participate in international efforts to address climate change 
using technology and the market
 ■Take appropriate measures in response to the technology-driven climate change initiatives led 
by the US (e.g., exporting efficiency technology, employing environmental strategies that can be 
used as an advantage in trade such as stricter standards and certification, etc)
  ※   Negotiation on the post-climate change system (to be completed in 2015): Breaking from the 
Kyoto Protocol, which focuses on reduction obligations for advanced countries and voluntary 
reduction for developing countries, a single framework that will bind all countries is being 
negotiated.
② GHG Emissions Reduction in the Power Generation Sector
 ◎ Adoption of reduction technology: Apply the best available technology to new plants, taking 
into account the technology's commercialization timing, and evaluate the reduction efforts of 
such plants

3. Improvement of Sustainability of Energy Policy
 ◎ Promotion of joint emissions reduction: Transition from the current reduction system, which 
is focused on large emitters and individual companies, toward a system which encourages 
cooperation between businesses, including large companies, SMEs, and industrial complexes
 ■Green Credits: Review the possibility of recognizing emissions reduction achieved with capital 
and technology investment of large companies in SMEs as external reduction performance 
(offsets) under the target scheme and emissions trading scheme
 ■Industrial cluster: Switch to low-carbon industrial clusters by establishing  integrated energy 
monitoring systems and joint power generation using waste heat
 ◎ Professionals: Identify promising job opportunities and systematize current manpower 
training programs based on the analysis of the supply and demand dynamics of human 
resources needed in Korea's climate change sector
 ◎ Specialized companies: Systematically nurture specialized service companies, including IT 
specialized ESCO companies connected to power and carbon markets and conservation (DR) 
consulting firms
 ■Design measures to promote service companies specialized in energy demand management 
and greenhouse gas emissions reduction (2014)
 ◎ Global green market: Establish comprehensive support mechanisms, supporting all stages 
of a project from selection and planning to financing and implementation, to help domestic 
businesses enter foreign markets

SIX MAJOR TASKSS
3. Improvement of Sustainability of Energy Policy
 ◎ Safety enhancement: In the wake of the Fukushima accident, measures have been taken to 
improve facility integrity (2012-2015, 1.1 trillion won) and nuclear power plant operations (59 
tasks).
B. Limitations
 ◎ There have been limitations in creating a sound foundation for the industry in the process of 
the rapid growth of the NPP industry over a short period of time
•  As Korea has pushed for 'NPP self-reliance*' in a short span of time, a few institutions and 
companies with a competitive edge have inevitably played a leading role in the formation of 
the industrial ecosystem.
*  (1978) Kori unit 1 → (1999) Uljin unit 3 and 4 (standard reactor (OPR1000)) → (2014) Shin-kori unit 3·4 
(new pressurized light water reactor, APR1400)
•  As a result of the nuclear industry's focus on a high level of technical expertise and 
specialization, it generally lacks competition, openness and supervision, leading to corruption 
and cronyism. 
•  The management system has been relatively lacking in safety and transparency, as the 
nuclear industry has overemphasized efficiency-oriented NPP construction and operation, 
and performance, focusing on increasing capacity factors, shortening construction periods, 
etc. 
 ◎ There is a growing need to bolster the systematic management and supervision over state-
owned NPP companies
•  The management activities of state-owned NPP companies are subject to virtually no 
government management and supervision, unlike government-led activities regarding 
technical safety and electricity supply and demand management.
•  The lack of a self-regulating and monitoring structure in the market as well as the insular 
structure of the industry have resulted in persistent problems, such as certificate forgery and 
corruption scandals.
 ◎ Since Korea won a contract to build NPPs in the UAE, global competition in the NPP market 
has become fiercer, while Korea has not taken sufficient measures to secure the foundation 
for NPP exports.
•  Korea is less experienced in project financing and lacks large-scale government funding 
compared to rival countries, such as Japan and Russia, where a large amount of government 
funding is available.

② Reform of Nuclear Industry
 ◎ Develop short and mid- to long-term anti-corruption measures by identifying structural 
problems in the nuclear industry, including the non-transparent procurement system, and 
gradually enforce such measures
 ■Short term: Immediately implement improvement measures and periodically carry out follow-
up management in accordance with the government's comprehensive plan (June 2013)
       ①   Eradication of collusive ties: Prohibit retirees of state-owned NPP companies from employment 
in cooperating companies, restricting bidding by companies hiring such retirees, etc.
       ②   Improvement of procurement: Minimize direct contracting without bidding, introduce pre-
qualification, disclose procurement plans in advance, etc.
       ③   Enhancement of quality: Examine documents related to the quality of NPP parts to determine 
whether such documents are forged by third party independent organizations
 ■Mid - to Long-term: Seek fundamental measures to foster competition in the industry and 
enhance the transparency of the value chain
       ① Encourage competition/expand supply networks in the nuclear market 
            *   Standardizing parts by opening markets dominated by certain companies to competition, 
easing bidding requirements by lowering entry barriers (delivery performance requirements) 
for newcomers, and creating a localized road-map by eliminating demand for certain 
companies
       ② Improve procurement procedures/ reform procurement management system
            *   Establish a price system based on original cost to prevent below-cost competition that could 
cause quality degradation and to guarantee appropriate prices; implement a Multiple Award 
Schedule to make insular procurement practices more transparent; develop an Integrated 
Management System to systematize complicated management systems; and strengthen the 
contractor management process to weed out substandard contractors
       ③ Enhance quality self-assessment of the nuclear industry

 ◎ Enlargement of public enterprises: The Korea National Oil Corporation (KNOC) has secured 
the minimum amount of oil (200,000 b/d) required to invest in high-quality and valuable fields,

 ◎ Advancement into key markets: Regional hubs have been secured and inroads have been 
made into new markets in the UAE, Iraq and other countries in the Middle East, which has the 
world’s highest oil reserves.
 
•  Supply and demand hubs of major minerals, including bituminous coal, copper and steel, 
have been established in Central and South America, Australia, Indonesia, and other regions, 
and the efforts to develop rare earth metals in emerging, untapped regions, such as Africa, 
has been expanded.

•  Insufficient technology and experience developing and operating mines has been gained 
given that projects related to operating rights for oil fields and mines accounted for 37.6% 
of all projects, and the share of KNOC’s investment in exploration projects was a mere 10% 
from 2008 to 2012.

 ◎ Weakened investment efficiency: The debt ratio of public enterprises has soared, and it is 
now agreed that past resource development was focused excessively on external growth 
through M&As and equity investment.
•  The debt ratios of public enterprises, including KNOC and KORES, have more than doubled 
over the past five years, increasing to the point that the level of debt threatens their financial

 ◎ Insufficient infrastructure for growth: Not enough has been done to establish infrastructure, 
such as human resources, R&D, and government support systems, necessary to take the 
overseas resource development industry to the next level.
*  Human resource: Mismatch between supply (mainly university graduates with bachelor’s degree) 
and demand (for graduates with master’s or doctoral degrees).
  Technology level: Korea’s technology level is 47% of that of advanced countries. Moreover, research 
has largely been conducted in laboratories, and as a result it has failed to reflect reality in the field. 
 ■Although the quantitative growth strategy, including the enlargement of public enterprises, 
could be considered successful in so far as it was necessary to secure the mid- to long-term 
growth of the overseas resource development industry.
 ■there have been negative effects, such as the weakened financial soundness of public 
enterprises and insufficient efforts to improve quality.
C. Main Tasks
① Enhancing Capabilities for Long-term Energy Security 
Using new indicators and terminology for resource development
 ◎ The “self-sufficiency rate/self-development rate” should be renamed the “resource 
development rate,” because the word “self” leads the public to mistakenly believe that the 
“self-sufficiency rate/self-development rate” is equivalent to the amount of resources flowing 
into Korea.
•  The resource development rate should be calculated by year (annual production/annual 
imports), instead of by the actual number of days of operation (daily resource development/
daily imports).
 ◎ Use the resource development rate as a long-term policy indicator, rather than as a short-
term, rigid performance indicator which have undermined investment efficiency
•  In order to ensure that the growth of public energy enterprises is centered on exploration, 
adopt the management efficiency indicators (e.g., securing new reserves) of global 
exploration and production companies as performance indicators of public enterprises

② Strengthening the Foundation of Public Energy Enterprises 
 
 ◎ Focus on exploration: Decrease investment in the form of simply buying shares and enhance 
mid- to long-term resource development capability by putting a greater emphasis on 
operating licenses, exploration and development.
•  Korea National Oil Cooperation: Increase the average proportion of investment in mining 
exploration to over 20% of total investment between 2013 and 2017 from current 10%, and 
enhance the success rate of exploration by concentrating scattered exploration capabilities

SIX MAJOR TASKS
4. Enhancement of Energy Security
 ◎ Industry: It is difficult for renewable energy to compete in the market due to low price 
competitiveness and technological limitations. 
•  External factors: Oversupply in the global market, intensified competition due to falling 
prices, as well as a low distribution rate
•  Internal factors: Location regulations and low public acceptance have resulted in a low 
deployment rate, limiting the size of the domestic market.
 ◎ R&D: The localization of core technologies in Korea has been low. Moreover, the link between 
technology commercialization and investment is weak due to the absence of technology 
commercialization programs.
*  The average import rate of main parts, materials and equipment (2011): Solar PV 79%, wind power 
85%, and fuel cells 91%
•  Inefficiencies, such as a disconnect from mid- to long-term investment, have arisen due to 
a lack of consideration for technology commercialization and separate budget allocation for 
different programs and energy sources.
 ◎ Policy environment: The policy environment is unfavorable due to low electricity rates, 
insufficient financial support, etc.
•  Electricity rates are consistently low compared to generation costs, leading to increased 
consumption of fossil fuels and undermining the deployment of renewable energy. 
 ◎ Low public acceptance: Although the necessity of renewable energy is widely recognized, 
opposition to high electricity rates, poor follow-up management of facilities, complaints from 
residents, and insufficient promotion efforts have led to low public acceptance. 
C. Mid- to Long-term (2035) Renewable Energy Deployment Targets 
 ◎ Deployment targets are based on supply potential, which is estimated through consideration 
of various factors, including economic feasibility, location regulations, and deployment 
conditions.
Estimating the potential supply of renewable energy
① Upgrade the existing resource map by improving accuracy and reliability
②   Estimates are based on the following steps, using the resource map:  
(1) theoretical potential → (2) geographical potential → (3) technological potential

D. Deployment and Commercialization Plans 
① Creating New Markets and Converging Related Systems
 ◎ Renewable Heat Obligation (RHO): Adopt the RHO, which requires new buildings to use a 
certain share of heat energy from renewable sources
•  First, require new buildings with more than 10,000㎡ in total floor space, except for residential 
and public buildings, to meet 10% of their heat energy demand with renewable sources
 ◎ Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS): Introduce the RFS, which requires transportation fuel to 
contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel
•  Initially, the RFS will be applied to biodiesel. Subsequently, a decision on whether to apply 
the RFS to bioethanol and biogas will be made in consideration of various factors, such as 
domestic supply and demand of raw materials, technology, and infrastructure. 
 ◎ Recommendation to heavy power consumers: Advise heavy power consumers to install 
their own renewable energy generators. A decision on whether to make such installation 
mandatory will be based on the results of such installations.
•  Review targets for the recommendation as well as required installed capacities of renewable 
energy by business type and size. Additionally, create incentive programs, such as a program 
linked to the GHG emission reduction
 ◎ Establishment of an integrated market: Integrate the renewable energy certificates (REC) 
markets for power, heat energy and transportation fuel to provide obligated entities with 
flexibility in terms of implementation and to expand the size of market
•  Link not only to renewable energy related programs, such as RPS (power), RHO (heat energy) 
and RFS (transportation fuel), but also to other energy programs, including the Greenhouse 
Gas and Energy Target Scheme and the Emissions Trading Scheme
② Improving Existing Systems for Further Deployment and Enhancement 
Reorganizing the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)
 ◎ Integration of the solar PV and non-solar PV markets: Integrate the solar PV market into 
the broader market from 2016 in order to give more options to power generators, increase 
flexibility, etc.
*  An independent market for solar PV has been created for the first four years (2012-2015) out of 
concern that deployment will be slow due to low economic feasibility. However, this has led to limited 
investment in solar PV.

Increased support for exports 
 ◎ Support for overseas projects: Provide package support for overseas projects, from the initial 
stage to installation, in order to encourage domestic companies to enter overseas markets 
 ◎ Strategic entrance into foreign markets: Pursue a package-type export strategy that, for 
example, links renewable energy exports to overseas resource development rights, as well 
as participating in renewable energy projects when winning contracts for fossil fuel power 
plant
*  Korea will participate in projects launched by developing countries seeking to introduce renewable 
energy systems. Possible projects include resource exploration, designing laws and institutions, and 
constructing infrastructure (standards and verification).
 ◎ Establishment  of international standards: Establish the existing five domestic standards as 
international standards by 2014, and propose another five new standards by the end of 2014
E. Promotion of Strategic Technology Development
① Strengthening Strategic R&D and Shifting to a Performance-centered Paradigm
 ◎ Expansion of R&D and creation of portfolios: Focus investment on renewable energy R&D 
until 2024. Investment should grow more than 5% annually. 
•  Produce a mid- to long-term investment strategy, including investment size and technology 
development priorities, in consideration of deployment targets, the mid- to long-term 
renewable energy mix, economic effects, etc.
 ◎ Market-leading program: Strategically reorganize the ongoing 9 programs into 5 pilot 
programs, including applied strategy and market-leading, to commercialize technologies and 
cut generation costs
•  Establish  four  R&D  strategies  -  low  cost,  technology  commercialization,  future

CHAPTER V
- Six Major Tasks - 5.   Establishment of 
a Stable Source-by-
Source Supply System
1. Oil
A. Supply and Demand Forecast 
 ◎ Global supply and demand forecast: Short-term supply and demand is expected to improve, 
and mid- to long-term supply and demand is expected to remain stable.  
•  In the short term, global economic growth will slow, while supply and demand will be in 
balance due to increased production by non-OECD countries. 
  -   The increase in non-OECD countries’ supply will be led by the production of unconventional 
oil in North America, including the U.S. and Canada. 
•  In the mid- to long-term, global oil demand is estimated to grow by approximately 0.9% a 
year, reaching 109.4 million b/d by 2035 (assuming an average annual economic growth rate 
of 3.0%). 
  -   The production capacity of OPEC members and the supply of unconventional oil, such as 
oil sand, from non-OPEC members are expected to increase, providing enough supply to 
consistently meet demand. 
 ◎ Forecast for domestic supply and demand: The supply-demand balance is expected to 
remain stable in the mid- to long-term.
•  In the short-term, an increase in the use of feedstock, such as naptha, for industrial 
purposes and an increase in demand from the transportation sector will result in modest 
growth of about 1.1% in 2014 despite the downward trend in demand for oil for heating and 
power generation.  
  -   Global oil prices and domestic demand will increase slowly, making it possible to secure a 
stable supply.
•  In the mid- to long-term, due to a continuous decrease in demand from non-transport 
sectors, total demand is estimated to fall from 2020 at an average annual rate of 0.15% to 
approximately 773.9 million barrels by 2035.
*  Oil dependency: 52.0% (2000) → 38.1% (2011) → 34.1% (2020) → 26.9% (2035)  
  -   Thanks to active overseas resource development and an increased rate of refinery 
upgrading, the capacity to supply oil products will improve in the long-term. However, 
decreased demand is expected to result in oversupply.

SIX MAJOR TASKS
5. Establishment of a Stable Source-by-Source Supply System
•  Construct infrastructure for oil logistics, provide incentives to encourage trading, and 
establish financial infrastructure  
Promotion of competition in the oil distribution market
 ◎ Promote competition using market forces by invigorating the spot market for oil (e-commerce) 
through successful oil distribution policies
•  Secure an adequate supply for the spot market through supply by non-refineries, such as 
import and e-commerce involving four major oil refineries, etc.; formulate measures to meet 
demand for oil through economical gas stations2), the sale of mixed oil, etc.
•  Once competition in the market is sufficiently stimulated, help level the playing field by 
encouraging the development of a system of free competition among market players
Improvement of oil quality management
 ◎ Establishment of a crackdown system: Form a system to conduct regular joint crackdowns 
and monitoring by relevant agencies until the sale of adulterated gasoline is eliminated
*  Crackdown on the illegal distribution of solvents, from the supply stage to the end-user purchase 
stage, to prevent such solvents from being used as ingredients in adulterated gasoline
 ◎ Computerized system for reporting supply and demand: Computerize the system for 
reporting supply and demand and trading conditions for oil products in order to catch signs of 
illegal distribution at an early stage.
2) A type of gas station where consumers can buy oil at a cheaper price. KNOC supplies oil to these gas 
stations by purchasing oil in large quantities.

A. Supply and Demand Forecast
 
 ◎ Global supply and demand: The Asian market is expected to lead the increase in demand 
for natural gas, and the supply of natural gas is expected to grow as the development of 
unconventional gas in North America picks up pace. 
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
2
•  From 2010 to 2035, global demand for natural gas will show the largest increase among 
primary energy sources backed by rising demand from emerging economies, such as China, 
India, and Brazil.  
 
*  Forecast for global demand for natural gas (billion tons, IEA):  2.7 (in 2011) → 3.2 (in 2020)  → 4.0 (in 
2035)
  - China (million tons): 105 (in 2011) → 245 (in 2020) → 422 (in 2035)  (Annual growth rate of 6.0%)
  - India (million tons): 49 (in 2011)  → 69 (in 2020) → 137 (in 2035) 
(Annual growth rate of 4.4%)
  - Brazil (million tons): 22 (in 2011) → 36 (in 2020) → 72 (in 2035) 
C

a
p
t
e
r

(Annual growth rate of 5.2%) 
 
•  The increase in the unconventional gas supply from North America will lead to an increased 
supply of natural gas in the global market, contributing to diversifying the global supply, 
which has been disproportionately concentrated in the Middle East and Russia, and 
alleviating the price gap between regions.  
*  Global natural gas production (billion tons) (the proportion of unconventional gas): (2011) 2.7 (17%)→ 
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
4
(2020) 3.2 (21%)→ (2035) 4.0 (27%)
 
•  Global demand for LPG will grow gradually, driven especially by LPG for petrochemical 
feedstock and domestic and commercial LPG.
*  Global LPG demand forecast (mb/d, IEA): 7.6 (2012) → 8.6 (2020) → 9.2 (2035) (Annual growth rate of 
0.8%) 
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
5
 ◎ Domestic supply and demand: Domestic demand for natural gas has steadily increased at 
an annual rate of 7.9% over the past 10 years due to expanded deployment of city gas and 
increased demand for generation and industrial use. 
 
*  Domestic natural gas demand (million tons): 18.45 (2003) → 23.50  (2006) → 24.64 (2009)  →  36.55 
(2012)
•  In the mid- to long-term, the industrial and transport sectors will drive the increase in 
demand, while demand from the power generation sector will depend on GHG emission 
reduction targets, base load power reserve ratios, etc.
C

5. Establishment of a Stable Source-by-Source Supply System
*  As of 2012, the top-down ratio (largest monthly usage / smallest monthly usage) is 2.6, indicating a 
significant seasonal demand gap.
B. Direction
① Stable Supply
Stable supply of oil 
 ◎ In response to changes in the global gas market, such as the expansion of shale gas 
development, diversify natural gas and LPG import sources, and secure a stable and 
sufficient supply of gas
*  Shale-based LNG from North America is planned to be imported to Korea from 2017 and LNG from 
2014. 
 ◎ Alleviate price risks related to oil price changes and enhance capability to develop and supply 
energy independently by linking gas field development, the construction and operation of 
liquefaction plants, and market deployment
*  As of December 2013, KOGAS was involved in 7 LNG projects, including LNG Canada. 
 ◎ Enhance the foundation for international cooperation by strengthening cooperation between 
large gas importers in Asia, establishing consultative mechanisms with major energy 
producing countries, etc.
*  Asia: Regularly hold Korea-Japan and Korea-China Gas Dialogues to enable collective action in 
response to major issues
  North America: Expand cooperation in the unconventional gas sector through the Canada-Korea 
Natural Gas Forum, Korea-U.S. workshops, etc.
 ◎ Diversify city gas supplies by establishing an institutional foundation to produce and deploy 
city gas other than biogas and other non-natural gases
Timely expansion of supply infrastructure 
 ◎ Expand LNG storage facilities in a timely manner in order to better respond to the high 
winter/low summer consumption pattern and ensure stable supply and demand in the mid- 
to long-term
*  Secure an additional storage capacity of 3.21 million ㎘ (or 1.46 million tons) by 2018, backed by the 
completion of the Samcheok plant (2014), the construction of additional facilities in District 4 of the 
Incheon plant (2018), etc.

135
SIX MAJOR TASKS
5. Establishment of a Stable Source-by-Source Supply System
•  Pursue strategic stockpiling to prepare for potential disruptions of the gas supply from 
demand surges caused by abnormal cold waves, conflicts in gas-producing countries, etc.
*  The size of the strategic stockpile should be determined based on analysis by research institutes of 
examples abroad
*  Examples of the strategic stockpiling abroad: (Spain) Equal to 20 days of winter season demand, 
(Poland) Equal to 30 days of imports
Expanded deployment of city gas
 ◎ Strengthen the foundation of the city gas supply by expanding the main city gas pipeline, and 
promote the deployment of city gas through policy loans and other measures
•  Increase the number of local governments providing city gas to 214 by 2017, and expand loan 
programs for projects to build pipelines in rural areas
*  Number of local governments with city gas (out of a total of 230 local governments in Korea): 186 (2012) 
→ 207 (2015) → 214 (2017)
 ◎ Address the problem of a city gas blind spot in some regions by installing small LPG storage 
tanks and pipelines for people in energy poverty within those regions
*  Eligibility for support: (Social welfare centers) 360 centers (2013) → 720 centers (2014) (all)
(Rural areas) 9 areas will receive support under the pilot program in 2014, and the program will be 
extended to more areas in the future.
 
Improvement of price transparency and support for low income families
 ◎ Implement a pricing mechanism which links commodity prices to gas rates, reflecting 
factors that change the cost of gas ingredients. In addition, enhance the transparency and 
appropriateness of the pricing mechanism*
*  Improve existing measures to strengthen the cost verification system. For example, design criteria 
to classify regulatory and non-regulatory projects and create an obligation to prepare financial 
statements for pricing purposes. Additionally, revise the criteria for calculating the supply price of 
natural gas.
 ◎ Realize inclusive welfare by maintaining the city gas tariffs discount program for beneficiaries 
of the Basic Livelihood Program*, the disabled, etc.
*  As of December 2013, beneficiaries receive a discount of 12,400 won monthly, which is about 20% of 
their average monthly electricity costs.
136

 ◎ Rationalize regulations on direct import by the private sector in order to contain potential 
inefficiency** caused by the natural gas monopoly system* and decrease the LNG import unit 
price 
 
*  Korea is the only OECD member which maintains a monopoly system in the natural gas sector. 
** In November 2012, the International Energy Agency recommended that Korea introduce competition 
into the wholesale gas market for the benefit of consumers and the overall Korean economy.  
C

•  Revise the Urban Gas Business Act to relax regulations on the sale and exchange of imports* 
to enable private-sector direct importers to manage supply and demand more efficiently
 
*  Under current law, direct importers are allowed to sell directly-imported gas only to gas wholesalers 
or to exchange such gas with other direct importers or gas wholesalers.  
Laying an institutional framework for the LNG trading business
C

 ◎ Given the high potential of the Northeast Asian LNG market* and the expected expansion 
of the shale gas supply**, an institutional framework should be laid for the private sector to 
enter the LNG trading business.
 
*  Northeast Asia is the largest LNG market in the world, importing 60% of the world’s LNG. The 
market is expected to enjoy continuous growth due to economic growth in China and increased gas 
generation in Japan.
C

** The full scale development and export of North American shale gas will bring an increased supply of 
LNG that is relatively cheap and has no restrictions on destination, thus making it easier to trade.
 
•  Introduce an LNG import and export business system in which an LNG trading business 
makes use of LNG storage facilities within bonded areas in Korea (revision of the Urban Gas 
Business Act)
*  Expected benefits include increased private sector investment in LNG terminals and job creation, 
increased tax revenue collected from profits generated in the trading business, and a large volume of 
gas imports in a short period of time

SIX MAJOR TASKS
5. Establishment of a Stable Source-by-Source Supply System
*  At the G8 summit in 2007, a declaration was adopted on significantly increasing the proportion of 
combined heat and power plants.
 ◎ Domestic market conditions: Despite favorable conditions for the integrated energy 
business*, the deployment rate of district heating is expected to remain low due to the poor 
development of residential land and other reasons.
*  Korea has even better conditions for introducing an integrated energy supply system than many 
advanced European countries, including an appropriate number of heating degree days (annual 
heating hours) and a high heat density (a high concentration of multi-family residential buildings).
 ◎ Changes in surrounding conditions: The importance of combined heat and power (CHP) 
plants as a tool to expand distributed power generation is rising as transmission lines 
become saturated due to high electricity demand from the metropolitan area. 
*  Generation capacity shortage of approximately 7,000 MW for Seoul and 11,700 MW for Gyeonggi 
province
*  Electricity shortage (consumption – production): Seoul (44,269 MWh), Gyeonggi province (71,923 
MWh) 
B. Direction
① Enhancing Distributed Power Generation
 ◎ Expanding CHP in the Seoul metropolitan area: Encourage the replacement of aged CHP* 
facilities and the construction of large-scale facilities in suburbs of the capital
•  CHP plants with a capacity of 4,435 MW will be built in the metropolitan area by 2020.  
*  Chuncheon POSCO E&C 422MW, Korea District Heating Corporation Hwaseong and DongtanⅡ 
840MW CHP plant construction
 ◎ Encouraging the construction of large-scale plants: Give priority to large areas with heat 
loads of at least 100 Gcal/h (or 100 MW) when selecting locations for new plants
•  Increase the weight of financial and technological capabilities in the new plant selection 
process, as these are good indicators of business sustainability 
•  Reduce regulations on the ratio of heat to power and introduce efficiency standards when 
granting permission to build CHP plants
*  The construction of large-scale CHP plants should be promoted by easing the ratio of heat to power.

with prices for power generation and grant exemptions from oil import tariffs
•  Since an integrated energy company is classified as electricity generation company according 
to Article 7 of the Electric Utility Act, the wholesale price of gas should be the same for CHP 
and for power generation. 
 
•  To promote distributed power generation, offer a 3 year (2014-2016) refund of import tariffs 
(19.39won/m3) imposed on integrated energy supply, including community electricity

 ◎ Increasing the transparency of heating prices: Establish standards for accounting and 
 
calculating prices as well as a heating price verification system
•  Establish by law accounting and cost calculating standards applicable to all market players 
and subject to external verification by a qualified institution
•  Promote the development of affordable heat sources, energy conservation, and renewable 
energy investment by reforming the pricing system to provide incentives for demand side 
management, such as authorizing different levels of return on investment

5. Establishment of a Stable Source-by-Source Supply System
•  The financial status of companies will be thoroughly examined in advance, and the alternative 
heat supply system will come into effect if a financially unstable company becomes insolvent 
and stops supplying gas.
•  Regulations for heat suppliers will be revised and MOUs will be concluded between 
companies on a voluntary basis to strengthen the responsibility of companies and rights of 
consumers in case of heat supply failures.
 ◎ Implementation of an integrated welfare system: Consider measures to integrate the 
different welfare systems of companies and revise heat prices to reflect welfare costs
 ◎ Encouragement of public involvement: Encourage public participation by making it mandatory 
to collect opinions of residents when considering a permit for a heat source that exceeds the 
predetermined level
•  Mandate that companies hold public hearings and information sessions when soliciting the 
opinions of local governments

Public Opinion
1. Reform of the Energy Welfare System
 ■Address blind spots of the energy welfare system and shift towards a welfare system 
customized to fit the needs and consumption patterns of recipients
A. Current Status
 ◎ In 2005, a middle school student whose family’s power had been cut died in a fire started by 
a candle. Following her death, the Korea Energy Foundation was launched in 2006, and the 
government began full scale efforts to create a legal basis for energy welfare, including the 
Energy Act in 2006.  
•  The First Energy Master Plan set a goal of reducing the number of energy poor to zero by 
2030. 
 ◎ An annual average of 3 million households received energy support totaling 1.8 trillion won 
during the last 5 years from 2008 to 2012. 
•  More funds were made available for energy welfare by increasing the budget of the Energy 
Efficiency Improvement Project and beginning the heating oil provision program in 2012. 
Moreover, the electricity tariff system was revised from a fixed rate system to a flat rate 
system in order to better serve low-income families. 
①   Facilities and products: Distribute renewable energy and improve efficiency by 
replacing obsolete boilers, installing insulation in homes, renovating doors and 
windows, etc.
    *   Energy Efficiency Improvement Project: 19.5 billion won in 2011 → 31.1 billion won in 2012 (to 
be confirmed) 
②   Heating bills: Provide heating oil (18,000 households, kerosene 200 l) and coal 
briquette coupons (83,000 households, 169,000 won)
③   Discounts on utilities: Provide discounts on electricity (8,000 won), gas (123.5 won/㎥) 
and heating costs (exemption from basic charges) 
④ Grace period:  Postpone service cuts in case of overdue electricity and gas bills  
⑤   Energy safety: Provide emergency measures for the marginalized in case of power  
failure, improve the safety of gas facilities, etc.

Expansion of energy welfare infrastructure
 
 ◎ Creating an energy welfare database: Collect district-by-district information from welfare 
recipients on energy sources in use, usage amount, and dwelling type, and establish a 
147
SIX MAJOR TASKS
6. Energy Policy Reflecting Public Opinion
management system linked to the Social Welfare Information System on the basis of this 
information
*  An integrated database which provides comprehensive data and analysis of each agency’s recipient 
information will be established. 
 ◎ Establishing an agency dedicated to energy welfare: Provide a legal basis for an agency 
dedicated to energy welfare
*  New provisions recognizing energy welfare as a basic human right should be added to relevant laws 
when they are revised. 
 ◎ Promoting public participation: Build a stronger foundation for energy welfare and expand 
social monitoring of project implementation through energy welfare projects in which the 
general public* can participate
*  A program which links energy conservation to the welfare system should be implemented. Under 
this program, a person who has surplus energy from reducing energy consumption will be able to 
select eligible entities (households or facilities) to which he/she may donate, and he/she will be able 
to follow how the donated energy is being used. 
2. Expansion of Local Government Participation
 ■Improve the efficiency of policy implementation by establishing regional energy governance 
in which local governments, which have direct contact with the public and businesses, play a 
leading role
 ■Delegate the planning and implementation of energy projects to local governments in order to 
reflect local needs and conditions
A. Progress
 ◎ Regional energy projects have been implemented since the mid-1990s. The deployment 
of renewable energy has been carried out on the supply side, while energy-efficient device 
deployment projects have been carried out on the demand side.  
•  Supply: The regional energy self-sufficiency rate has been improved through renewable 
energy deployment projects. 
*  Financial support: The total amount of support increased from 120 million won in 1996 to 721.6 billion 
won in 2013. 
148
KOREA  ENERGY MASTER PLAN
•  Demand management: Deployment of LED lighting and other energy-efficient products was 
mainly led by public agencies. By late 2012, the deployment rate of LED in the public sector 
was estimated to be approximately 15.5%.

*  Financial support: The total amount of financial support for demand management increased from 
 
880 million won in 1996 to 238.1 billion won in  2013.
B. Limitations
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
2
 ◎ Governance: There is insufficient organization, manpower, legal institutions and other 
infrastructure needed for policy implementation.
 
•  Only approximately 10% of local governments have a well-established implementation 
system, such as the Basic Energy Ordinance (28 out of 230 local governments). 
•  The implementation of energy policies is assigned to a number of different teams, including 
construction, industry, transportation, climate change and environment teams. Moreover, 
the role of the private-public National Energy Committee* is limited. 
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
3
 
*  The National Energy Committee consists of and is run by local governments, local assemblies, 
research institutes, civil groups, and other participants to advise, deliberate on and coordinate energy 
policy in accordance with the Basic Energy Ordinance.
 ◎ Policy Design: Local governments have not been able to fully participate in the central 
government’s policy-making process, meaning that the division of roles between the central 
and local governments and coordination across policies have been insufficient*. 
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
4
 
*  The Regional Energy Plan and the Energy Master Plan, which are required by law, are not 
coordinated with each other. In addition, since most of the authority for carrying out the plans belongs 
to the central government, local governments lack policy tools.  
•  Although local governments are obliged to annually set out Action Plans for Energy Use 
Rationalization, such Action Plans are rarely implemented and are carried out only at the 
public agency level.  
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
5
 
 ◎ Project implementation: For energy conservation projects, a high reliance on central 
government subsidies has resulted in decreased project development efforts as the share of 
government support fell from 70-100% to 50%. 
*  The amount of subsidies applied for by local governments (in billion won): 194.7 (2011) → 194.1 (2012) 
C
h
a
p
t
e
r
6
→ 122.5 (2013) → 95.6 (2014) 
•  Policies and programs planned by local governments are too few and tend to be short-term, 
 
yearly plans whose purpose and size change every year. 
149
SIX MAJOR TASKS
6. Energy Policy Reflecting Public Opinion
•  For renewable energy deployment projects, insufficient consideration has been given to the 
different characteristics of each region and energy source. As a result, the majority of such 
projects have been concentrated in solar PV, which is easy to install. 
*  Solar PV projects received 70.4% of regional renewable energy deployment program funds. 
C. Main Tasks
① Establishment of Regional Energy Governance
 ◎ Enhancing the legal basis: Encourage lower-level local governments to establish their own 
Regional Energy Ordinances and promote the implementation of policies which can improve 
the effectiveness of such Ordinances
•  Upper-level local governments should hold regular Energy Committee meetings, and lower-
level local governments should create Committees on Energy Conservation Practices and 
focus on specific demand management efforts. 
 ■Energy Committee: Responsible for the development and evaluation of basic energy 
management policies, deliberation on Regional Energy Plans, preparation of private-public 
cooperation measures, deliberation on restrictions imposed on the energy consumption of 
facilities and individuals, etc.
 ■Committee on Energy Conservation Practices: Responsible for discussion of measures 
to promote energy conservation practices, evaluation of energy conservation policies and 
performance, development and assessment of alternative energy projects, including solar PV 
and geothermal, etc. 
 ◎ Strengthening the role of policy: Design Regional Energy Plans which reflect regional 
conditions and priorities
•  Guarantee the autonomy of local governments by replacing the existing approach, in which 
individual energy projects are assigned to local governments, with a new approach, in which 
each local government forms its own energy project portfolio

② Improvement of the Effectiveness of Regional Energy Projects 
 ◎ Energy Efficiency Improvement Project: Shift eligibility for support from facility replacement 
projects to systematic projects* in order to improve the effectiveness of regional energy 
conservation projects  
*   Priority will be placed on supporting generation and heat supply facilities using waste heat from 
incinerators, cooling and heating systems using treated wastewater or sea water, EMSs of buildings 
and factories, etc. 
•   Local governments should implement projects to replace high-energy-consuming products 
with energy-efficient products that have high economic feasibility using ESCO, project 
financing, and policy loans. 
 ◎ Renewable energy: Create local government-led Renewable Energy Towns in consortium 
with local governments, citizens, research institutes, etc. 
*  Consortium: Project plan design, installation, and maintenance 
  Government: Project selection, monitoring, etc.
③ Establishment of a Foundation for Regional Energy Policy 
 ◎ Infrastructure: Create a system that supports energy statistics and demand management 
programs* of local governments
*  A support system includes the following: analysis and projection of changes in energy consumption 
patterns, energy conservation effects of each demand management program, economic feasibility 
assessments, monitoring of policy impacts, etc. 
 ◎ Promotion of public participation: Use private-public partnerships to establish a governance 
structure focused on sector-specific demand management ranging from households to 
buildings and transportation
•  Set energy reduction targets based on detailed data at the local government and community 
levels, assign roles to major players, and develop programs.
 
Examples of regional energy project implementation that involves the public 
 ■   Establish energy conservation targets and detailed plans for implementation based 
on apartment building-specific surveys of power usage, number of households, and 
number of residents per household
 ■   In carrying out the Energy Efficiency Improvement Project for residential buildings, 
establish a governance system for each topic and issue. For example, forge a 
partnership  that  consists  of  residents,  construction  companies,  assessment 
companies, and civic groups.

local residents, such as regional support
*  Example: Heads of nuclear power plant headquarters, heads of Guns (or counties), Chairs of Gun 
assemblies, environmental watch groups, regional organizations, non-governmental experts, etc. 
 ◎ When a major issue arises relating to nuclear power plants, hold a briefing session about the 
issue and facilitate information exchange with citizens with the help of non-governmental 
environmental watch groups. Moreover, promote resident participation in inspection and 
monitoring.
*  Information reported to regulatory authorities, information on planned preventive maintenance and 
failure/shutdown, relevant briefing sessions, frequent information sharing on nuclear power plant
