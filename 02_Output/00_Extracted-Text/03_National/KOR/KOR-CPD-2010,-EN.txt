9.  UNFPA assistance to the Democratic People’s 
Republic  of  Korea  began  in  1985.  Since  then, 
UNFPA  has  supported  four  country  programmes

(2004-2006).  The 
programmes  focused  on  maternal  and  neonatal 
health,  family  planning,  and  population  and

per 100 girls to 106 boys per 100 girls. People over 
65  years  old  account  for  8.7  per  cent  of  the 
population, an increase of 3.3 per cent since 1993. 
The  ageing  of  the  population  is  due  to  the  decline

UNFPA country programme, 2007-2010, helped to: 
(a)  develop  national  emergency  obstetric  and 
neonatal  care  training  manuals  for  pre-service  and 
in-service training; (b) support emergency obstetric 
and  neonatal  care  services  (including  essential 
medical  supplies  and  training)  in  four  provinces, 
covering  11  county  hospitals  and  273  village 
clinics;  (c)  ensure  an  uninterrupted,  nationwide 
supply of two essential reproductive health drugs to 
reduce  maternal  mortality;  (d)  strengthen

survey  supported  by  UNFPA  and  the  United 
Nations  Children’s 
the 
contraceptive prevalence rate was 58.5 per cent for 
modern  methods,  of  which  82  per  cent  were

11.  Lessons  learned  during  the  previous  country 
programme  indicate  the  need  to:  (a)  consolidate 
capacity-building at the central level while seeking 
funds  to  scale  up  essential  emergency  obstetrical 
and neonatal care services at the subnational levels, 
where  needs  are  most  pressing;  (b)  ensure  that 
quality standards are applied to reproductive health 
services,  and  that  adherence  to  such  standards  is 
high-quality,

comprehensive  reproductive  health  services  are 
replicated;  (d)  promote  joint  activities  and  seek 
opportunities  for  joint  programming  with  other 
United  Nations  organizations,  to  avoid  duplication 
of efforts and to increase impact; (e) strengthen the 
capacity  of  national  institutions  to  analyse  and 
utilize  survey  and  census  results  for  planning  and 
policy formulation; and (f) continue to support the 
joint  contingency  plan  for  natural  disasters  and  to 
ensure  the  availability  of  emergency  reproductive 
health kits.

16.  This  component  has  one  outcome  to  be 
achieved by 2015: increased utilization of essential, 
high-quality  reproductive  health  information  and 
services  by  women  and  men,  as  well  as  neonatal 
care.  It  contributes  to  two  priority  areas  of  the 
United  Nations  Strategic  Framework: 
social 
development, and climate change and environment. 
the 
Two  outputs  will  be  achieved  under 
reproductive health and rights outcome.  
III.  Proposed programme 
12.  The  proposed  country  programme  will 
support the national goal of restoring the quality of 
life  of  the  people  to  the  level  achieved  before  the 
economic and humanitarian difficulties of the mid-
1990s.  The  programme  contributes 
the 
achievement  of 
the  United  Nations  Strategic 
Framework, 2011-2015, and its three priority areas: 
for 
(a)  social  development; 
knowledge  and  development  management;  and  
(c)  climate  change  and  environment.  The 
programme  is  harmonized  with  the  programme 
cycles of UNDP and UNICEF. 
17.  Output 1: Improved availability of and access 
to  essential,  high-quality 
reproductive  health 
information, counselling and services, including the 
prevention  and  treatment  of  reproductive  tract 
infections  and  screening  for  cervical  cancer,  in 
programme  areas.  The  strategies  to  achieve  this 
output  include:  (a)  advocating  the  formulation  of 
national  reproductive  health  policies,  guidelines 
and standards; (b) strengthening the capacity of the 
Ministry  of  Public  Health  to  implement  and 
monitor  these  policies,  guidelines  and  standards; 
and (c) enhancing the capacity of service providers 
in  11  counties  assisted  in  the  previous  country 
programme 
to  provide  high-quality, 
comprehensive reproductive health services and to 
ensure the sustainability of these services.

(b)  partnership 
13.  Building  on  the  results  achieved  and  lessons 
learned  the  programme  will  be  carried  out  at  the 
national level to: (a) develop capacity in the use of 
population data for national planning; (b) establish 
a  national  policy,  guidelines  and  standards  for 
reproductive  health  services;  and  (c)  scale  up 
essential  and  basic  reproductive  health  services 
through  cost-effective  interventions.  At  the  grass-
