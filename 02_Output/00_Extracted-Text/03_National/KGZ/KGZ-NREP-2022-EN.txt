FOREWORDS
The Kyrgyz Republic, like many countries in Central Asia and around the world, is striving to overcome the enduring challenges posed by 
the COVID-19 pandemic. As efforts to secure a comprehensive socio-economic recovery continue, there is a need to focus on far-reaching 
measures that can help build a more resilient and diversified economy, improve the energy sector’s viability, attract investments in clean 
energy projects and propel the country towards its climate goals. 
The Kyrgyz Republic relies on large hydropower installations for its electricity needs. However, the demand in end use sectors (e.g. heating 
and transportation) is predominantly addressed through oil, coal and natural gas. Overall, the energy sector is central to the socio-economic 
development of the Republic. 
As the country continues to develop, the social, environmental, resource and climate concerns linked to energy consumption are set to 
intensify. Rising fossil fuel imports are adding to the financial burdens of an energy sector undermined by ageing infrastructure and low 
revenues. The transition to renewable energy is therefore a key imperative for decision-makers of the country. 
This  Renewables  Readiness  Assessment  (RRA)  presents  a  strong  case  for  a  greater  share  of  renewables  in  the  broader  energy  sector 
(especially in transport and heating), coupled with diversification toward dynamic technologies such as solar PV, wind and small hydro in 
the power sector. It identifies twelve concrete actions to help the Government in addressing energy challenges, developing a more diverse 
energy sector and improving the livelihoods of its citizens. 
Decision-makers in the Kyrgyz Republic are aware of the promising potential of renewables. The announcement of a more ambitious NDC, 
and ongoing reforms in renewable energy-related laws and regulations, signify their clear intent to achieve a sustainable energy future. 
I sincerely appreciate the leadership and support provided by the Ministry of Energy and Industry of the Kyrgyz Republic in the preparation 
of this RRA, and the insights of the other partners that broadened the perspective of the assessment. IRENA looks forward to working with 
all of these stakeholders to transform these recommendations into practical, on-the-ground initiatives.

Director-General

This renewables readiness assessment (RRA) represents an important step toward establishing a secure, modern, diversified and clean 
energy system in the Kyrgyz Republic. This report, prepared by IRENA in collaboration with the Ministry of Energy of the Kyrgyz Republic, 
reflects the unwavering resolve of the Cabinet of Ministers to identify a trajectory for sustainable national growth in line with international 
climate commitments, and the natural and environmental resources of the country.
Having set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 44% by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, Kyrgyzstan recognises 
that renewables – primarily hydropower – will be the driver of zero-carbon policies, given their enormous potential in the country.
The Kyrgyz Republic has significant potential across all renewable energy technologies, with hydropower being the most promising. The 
Cabinet of Ministers of the Kyrgyz Republic is pursuing several initiatives to convert this potential into tangible and significant renewables 
use. In this context, the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, Sadyr Zhaparov, signed the Law on Renewable Energy Sources, which was then 
adopted by the Jogorku Kenesh [Supreme Council] of the Kyrgyz Republic.
The  Law  covers  regulation  of  relations  linked  to  the  use  of  renewables;  the  key  principles  of  national  renewable  energy  policies;  and 
economic, organisational and legal mechanisms in the field of renewables. It aims to improve the attractiveness of the renewables sector for 
investments, and the Ministry of Energy will continue to play a central role in championing cost-effective and reliable renewable technologies 
in the country.
The expediency of accelerated development of renewable energy sources in the Kyrgyz Republic stems from current electricity shortages 
and the need to include renewable energy in the economic development and fuel mix of the Republic. In this regard, a critical challenge 
today is the need to commission new capacities; namely both large and small facilities for the production of energy based on renewables. 
New renewables technologies are able to provide competitive energy supply, while reducing negative impacts on the environment and 
human  health,  bringing  opportunities  for  universal  access  to  inexpensive,  reliable,  sustainable  and  modern  energy  sources  for  various 
categories of consumers - one of the obligations of the Kyrgyz Republic under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The Ministry of Energy of the Kyrgyz Republic acknowledges the valuable inputs provided by all stakeholders and the insights gained during 
the preparation of this renewables readiness assessment.
The RRA aims to achieve ambitious goals in green energy development, and I am confident that it represents a positive contribution to 
policy planning for the Kyrgyz Republic’s energy sector.
The Ministry of Energy of the Kyrgyz Republic hopes that this cooperation with IRENA will mark the beginning of a significant evolution in 
the promotion of renewable energy development, supporting long-term planning and approaches as well as further beneficial co-operation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The  energy  sector  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  central  to  the  country’s  development  and  growth.  As  the  population 
continues to increase, living standards improve and the economy grows, energy demand has been rising. Domestic 
consumption far exceeds local production, which leads to costly fuel imports, and makes the transition to clean energy 
a key imperative for decision making in the sector. Balancing the objectives of sustainable growth while addressing the 
challenges posed by climate change and energy sector dynamics is difficult. Cognisant of this, Kyrgyz decision makers 
are  taking  legislative  strides  towards  a  more  sustainable  energy  sector,  which  can  help  address  the  rising  demand 
through clean energy sources.
A relative economic boom from 2010 onwards boosted energy demand, with final energy consumption rising by about 
54% in the 2010-2019 period. The main energy consumers include the residential, industry and transport sectors. Driven 
by improving living standards and rising demand for heating, energy consumption in the residential sector quadrupled 
between 2010 and 2019.
Demand for energy is addressed by oil products, electricity, coal, natural gas and heat. Oil products account for around 
37% of the primary energy supply, followed by electricity (primarily hydropower) at 30% and coal at 26%. Since 2000, 
the energy mix has gradually shifted towards oil and coal as the production of hydropower has stagnated. Indeed, a 
very limited amount of hydroelectric capacity has been put into operation in recent decades. In addition to being used 
for heating, oil products are primarily used to address rising demand for transport fuel. Domestic coal is being utilised 
for  exports  and  local  consumption  in  heating  and  other  sectors.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  among  the  most  energy-
intensive countries in the world, which gives rise to recurring energy shortages and reduces economic productivity and 
competitiveness (World Bank, 2017a). 
The power sector now has the challenging task of meeting the new level of electricity demand, which has increased 
by about 75% since 2010. The bulk of power generation (92%) is supplied by hydropower plants followed by small 
contributions from coal- and gas-fired power plants. The power sector also contributes to the socio-economic growth of 
the region through electricity trade. The dominant role of hydropower leads to strong interlinkages between irrigation 
and power, creating challenges for decision makers in the power and agricultural sectors. Ageing infrastructure, power 
sector entities’ lack of financial viability, energy losses and limited new generation systems are other key challenges, 
which tend to reduce the quality and reliability of electricity. 
A strong rationale for diversification 
A more diverse Kyrgyz energy sector that relies on various renewable energy technologies, increased energy efficiency 
and accelerated electrification can help address rising energy demand while creating economic opportunities.
While large hydropower is set to retain its role as the backbone of the sector, the introduction of renewables such as 
solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, bioenergy and small hydropower can help meet demand and diversify the energy mix. 
The rationale for diversification towards renewables includes various social, economic and environmental factors.
Rising energy demand and energy imports: As energy consumption continues to rise, reliance on imported fossil fuels 
will increase. Excessive fossil fuel imports pose a significant burden on government budgets and could create energy 
security issues. Dependence on imported fossil fuels could also make the Kyrgyz Republic more vulnerable to volatility 
in international and regional fuel markets. Renewable energy technologies can help cater to domestic energy demand, 
thus helping to cut down the import bill.
Deteriorating infrastructure: The deterioration of energy sector infrastructure coupled with the financial crisis in the 
energy system will eventually lead either to a significant decrease in the quality of produced energy or to an increase 
in energy prices. Both of these impacts could increase demand for independent energy production and pave the way 
for the deployment of reliable renewable energy technologies.
Local air pollution: The Kyrgyz Republic is among those Central Asian nations most affected by diseases linked to 
indoor air pollution. In the winter months, the city of Bishkek regularly features among the top polluted cities in the 
world due to its air quality. Renewables could help replace fossil fuels (especially coal) in heating and power generation, 
thus reducing air pollution. Vehicular emissions can be reduced through greater adoption of public transport and the 
uptake of electric vehicles.
Mitigating climate change: The Kyrgyz Republic is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and national decision 
makers  understand  the  importance  of  addressing  this  impending  challenge.  They  are  initiating  mitigation  and 
adaptation plans and programmes to ward off the impacts and to contribute to the international climate effort. 
7
Declining renewable energy costs: Renewable energy technology prices, which are becoming increasingly competitive 
with fossil fuel alternatives, further strengthen the case for the uptake of non-hydro renewables. The levelised costs of 
solar PV and wind, for example, declined by 85% and 56%, respectively, between 2010 and 2020.
Short construction periods of renewables: The Kyrgyz Republic’s rising energy demand needs to be met with rapid 
investments in sustainable and clean technologies. Renewables such as solar PV, wind and small hydropower tend to 
be modular and can be constructed in a very short time. In contrast, large hydropower projects tend to require longer 
construction times and can be susceptible to delays.
Seasonal variation in hydroelectricity generation: Hydropower in the Kyrgyz Republic is influenced by several factors 
such as seasonal variability of river flows, electricity demand and water demand for irrigation. An energy system that 
includes a diverse mix of complementary renewable energy technologies can be more resilient to seasonal variations.
Environmental impacts of hydropower: Large hydropower projects, just like many other large infrastructure projects, 
can  have  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts  such  as  displacement,  habitat  destruction,  loss  of  forest  and 
disturbance to wildlife. A shift towards small hydropower projects can help avoid some of the impacts linked with large 
projects. Also, run-of-river hydropower installations can sidestep several of the impacts associated with reservoirs.
Abundant  renewable  energy  resources:  The  country  has  significant  renewable  energy  potential  for  solar,  wind, 
bioenergy and hydropower. These resources can be utilised to create a diversified energy system that is sustainable 
from financial, social, climatic and environmental perspectives.
While the rationale for greater inclusion of renewables in the energy sector is clear, wide-scale deployment has been 
held back by several issues:
•  Average power and heat tariffs are well below cost recovery, which holds back renewables at the retail level.
•  Renewable energy targets have not been effective as they are not enforced by law, or backed by concrete policies.
•  Renewable energy policies remain limited to the power sector, with little focus on heating and transport. Distributed 
generation policies such as net metering and wheeling are also not in place.
• 
Feed-in tariffs have not been successful in attracting investments, as the levels are low and the frameworks are 
not clear.
•  Auctions/tenders have not been successful in the past.
• 
Permitting procedures require further clarification.
•  Renewable energy capacity building is needed for public and private stakeholders.
Recommendations for the deployment of renewable energy
The Renewables Readiness Assessment presents a set of short- to medium-term recommended actions to address key 
challenges and support the country in moving towards a diversified and climate-friendly energy system.
Create a level playing field with energy tariff reforms
Well-designed  tariff  reforms  in  the  energy  sector  can  help  generate  revenue  while  lowering  the  barrier  to  market 
entry for distributed renewable energy technologies. To be sustainable, tariff reforms should be designed in a way to 
minimise the economic impact on low-income and marginalised parts of society.
Streamline the procedure for bringing renewable energy projects online
Permitting  requirements  and  procedures  should  be  streamlined  under  an  overarching  renewable  energy  law, 
implemented  through  concrete  secondary  regulations,  which  clearly  articulate  the  process  and  identify  responsible 
government entities. The design of the procedures should focus on simplicity, flexibility and transparency.
Improve the feed-in tariffs
The  feed-in  tariffs  scheme  should  be  revised  and  improved  based  on  factors  such  as  changing  market  conditions, 
competitive technology costs and clear resource assessments. The selection of an appropriate tariff is an extensive 
process that should be led by the government with active and diverse representation from all stakeholders. Feed-in 
tariffs need to be supported by a conducive policy and clear institutional responsibilities.
Implement auctions for large capacities
Auctions can be used to attract investment for relatively large-scale projects in hydropower, solar and wind. They need 
to be designed in a way that attracts developers, enhances competition and enables price discovery while ensuring 
project delivery.
8
Enact policies to decarbonise end-use sectors
The decarbonisation of the heating sector needs a multifaceted approach that includes renewables-based electrification, 
use of renewable heating (where available, solar thermal, biomass, geothermal) and investments in efficient district 
heating. In the transport sector, more efficient public transport, electric vehicles and support for alternative modes of 
transportation (e.g. bicycle and walking infrastructure) can help. The introduction of net metering, wheeling and other 
distributed generation policies can help unlock the small-scale market segment. 
Improve renewable energy resource mapping
Zoning for solar PV and wind should be prioritised. An analysis of potential suitability, as conducted by the IRENA, 
identifies suitable zones for solar PV and wind, and can serve as an important initial step towards a complete zoning 
assessment. Follow-up studies could build on this exercise by performing detailed technical and economic analyses 
and ground-based measurements within the identified solar and wind zones. 
Develop long-term energy scenarios
A detailed long-term planning exercise should be undertaken for energy demand in all sectors to identify the optimal 
energy  mix.  Scenario  analyses  that  explore  a  host  of  different  energy  sector  futures  can  be  used  to  inform  policy 
making.  Energy  sector  planning  needs  to  be  complemented  by  reforms  in  the  collection  and  reporting  of  energy 
statistics.
Establish comprehensive and ambitious renewable energy targets
Renewable energy targets should reflect the country’s strong renewable energy potential, declining technology costs 
and rising energy demand. They are best backed by strong political commitment and legislation, to be defined at the 
level of the sector and further disaggregated by subsector. 
Adopt a standard power purchase agreement 
Design  elements  of  renewable  energy  power  purchase  agreements  (PPAs)  should  be  devised  in  accordance  with 
international  best  practices  to  de-risk  investments  and  facilitate  financing.  This  effort  may  be  complemented  by  a 
thorough review of contractual project document templates for renewables along with the development of standardised 
PPAs.
Introduce public-private partnerships 
To be successful, the introduction of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the Kyrgyz energy sector must be backed by 
strong political will, capable institutions and conducive legislation. Fair risk-sharing criteria must be established. On the 
public side, there should be an absolute commitment to the long-term payment for energy production. On the private 
side, penalties should be levied if services are not delivered.
Enhance institutional capacities
The  technical  and  co-ordination  capabilities  of  public  and  private  sector  entities  require  improvement  to  facilitate 
renewable  energy  deployment.  Topics  to  address  include  technology  costs,  grid  integration  issues,  economic 
management and the introduction of flexibility mechanisms, regulatory aspects, policy design, etc. 
Educate and train a skilled workforce
Investment in the education and training of workers such as engineers, technicians and other skilled personnel is very 
important. Universities, vocational training institutes and schools all have a role to play. Industry upgrade programmes, 
joint ventures and tax breaks can be used to strengthen local industrial capabilities.

1.  INTRODUCTION
The Kyrgyz Republic is a landlocked, mountainous country in the northeast of Central Asia. The country borders Uzbekistan to 
the west, Kazakhstan to the north, China to the east and Tajikistan to the south. The total area of the country is approximately 
200 000 square kilometres (km2) (Energy Charter, 2018).
About 80% of the country is mountainous; the rest is valleys and basins. The climate is continental, with strongly defined 
seasons.  The  rugged  topography,  with  large  differences  in  altitude,  determines  the  variety  of  climatic  conditions  and 
temperatures in different regions of the country. The annual average sunshine level, at 2 100-2 900 hours/year, is similar to 
that of Türkiye and Greece (Energy Charter, 2018).
The country is divided into nine administrative areas, including seven provinces and the two main cities of Bishkek 
and Osh (Figure 1.1). Bishkek is the national capital and the largest city with a population exceeding 1 million people 
(1 074 000 people in 2020). Osh (322 000 people), Jalal-Abad (123 000) and Karakol (84 000) are other major cities 
(NSC, 2021).
The republic has significant water resources. It is the only Central Asian country where almost all the water resources originate 
within national borders. The Kyrgyz Republic’s lakes, glaciers and rivers are a significant part of the country’s hydrological 
resources. The republic’s 1 923 lakes and reservoirs hold more than 1 745 cubic kilometres (km3) of water, most of which is 
stored in lake Issyk-Kul. Glaciers are estimated to hold 760 km3 of water, but this water source has been decreasing in recent 
decades. There are more than 25 000 rivers, of which 73 are more than 50 km in length, and the remaining are smaller. 
Irrigated farming accounts for around 90% of water consumption, followed by industrial purposes (6%), household use (3%) 
and other uses (1%) (DWRLI, 2021; Mamatkanov, Bazhanova and Romanovsky, 2006; Ratnaweera et al., 2013).

1.1  Socio-economic conditions
The population of the Kyrgyz Republic stood at around 6.6 million people at the beginning of 2021. One-third of the 
resident population (34%) lived in urban settlements with the remaining living in rural areas. The population density 
averaged 33 people/km2. The average life expectancy was 68 years for the male population and 76 years for the female 
population. The inflation rate was 5% in 2019, and the unemployment rate in the country amounted to 5.5% (NSC, 2021; 
World Bank, 2020). 
The poverty level in the country was 25% in 2020, which is the second highest in the Central Asia region after Tajikistan 
(NSC,  2021;  World  Bank,  2021).  Around  1.3  million  people  lived  below  the  poverty  line  in  2019,  of  which  74%  were 
residents of rural settlements. While a fourth of the country’s population was poor, 58% were considered vulnerable 
(with per capita income less than USD 5.5/day). Concerns about poverty have direct implications for the energy sector, 
particularly  when  it  comes  to  tariff  setting.  The  current  social  safety  net  is  not  adequate  to  mitigate  the  potential 
impacts of a tariff increase on the poor (IMF, 2019; NSC, 2021).
An unstable political situation and low level of economic development are considered to be contributing factors to the 
three political crises of 2005, 2010 and 2020. Increases in electricity tariffs and the obscure privatisation processes of 
energy companies have also contributed to social unrest and instability in the Kyrgyz Republic in recent decades. The 
affordability and reliability of the energy supply remain very sensitive issues (Energy Charter, 2018; Mallinson, 2020).
The  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2020  amounted  to  Kyrgyz  Republic  soms  (KGS)  601  billion  (USD  7  billion),1  
following a contraction of 8.4% from 2019 due to social unrest, a financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the 
past couple decades, GDP growth averaged at around 4.45%, compared to 6.5% in the other Caucasus and Central 
Asia2 countries and 5.3% in emerging market developing economies3 (IMF, 2019; World Bank, 2021). In response to the 
pandemic, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic (GoK) introduced several socio-economic measures to encourage 
economic growth in a more sustainable and climate-friendly direction (UNFCCC, 2021). 
National estimates show that between 2010 and 2020 GDP increased from USD 920 to USD 1 231 per capita (NSC, 
2021). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated it at USD 1 330 in 2022. Income per capita has lagged behind 
that of comparator countries over the last couple decades. Meanwhile, the income gap with emerging market countries 
has  been  increasing.  In  2019,  the  IMF  estimated  that  at  its  forecasted  growth  rate  (3.8%  on  average  over  2020-
2023), GDP per capita in the Kyrgyz Republic would require 23 years to reach middle-income GDP per capita levels 
(USD 2 370). Achieving this benchmark may become more difficult due to the COVID-19–related economic slowdown 
(IMF, 2019; SAEPF, 2020).
The country has considerable economic potential based on its resources, including pastures (48%) and arable land 
(7% of the country) along with substantial forests and minerals (World Bank, 2020).
According  to  data  for  2019  (Figure  1.2),  trade  accounts  for  about  18%  of  GDP,  followed  by  the  industrial  sector  at 
14%. The basis of industry is the country’s largest gold deposit at Kumtor. The agriculture sector accounts for 12% of 
GDP, the construction sector for about 10%, transport 4%, while other services make up the rest. Energy generation, 
transmission, distribution and supply account for about 2.3% of GDP (NSC, 2021). 
The two largest sectors contributing to the country’s GDP - domestic trade and industry - employ about 16% and 12%, 
respectively, of the working population. The agriculture sector employs the largest share of the working population,  
at  18%,  though  this  sector  is  only  the  third  largest  in  terms  of  its  contribution  to  GDP.  The  significant  differences 
between these sectors in employment and their contribution to GDP is explained by the presence of a large informal 
economy in the agriculture sector and the comparatively low income of informal workers. The added value received as 
a result of hidden and informal production (excluding agriculture) is estimated at 23.4% of GDP. The electricity, gas and 
steam generation, transmission, distribution and supply subsectors employ 1.3% of the total working population of the 
country, or about 13% of industrial workers (Energy Charter, 2018; NSC, 2021).

The country’s economy relies on three highly volatile sources of revenue including mineral resources, remittances and 
foreign aid, and loans. Around 31% of the country’s GDP in 2020 was through remittances. The Kyrgyz Republic is rich 
in mineral resources but has negligible oil and natural gas, which it imports. Substantial deposits of coal, gold, uranium, 
antimony and other valuable metals are included in its mineral reserves (World Bank, 2021).
This reliance leads to vulnerability to external economic shocks. Economic growth in the past decade has been driven 
mainly by the service sector, including trade, while the contribution of the industrial sector has been fluctuating given 
the strong presence of natural resource processing activities (Rovenskaya et al., 2018).
1.2  Renewables Readiness Assessment 
A transition towards renewable energy in all energy sector applications can help address energy demand while creating 
economic opportunities and position the Kyrgyz Republic as a global example for sustainable growth and well-being. 
The Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) aims to support the GoK in this transition. The RRA was initiated by 
the Ministry of Energy and Industry (MOEI) in 2021 in co-operation with the IRENA, to support the country’s efforts in 
enabling the greater adoption of various renewable energy technologies in the energy sector.
IRENA  developed  the  RRA  as  a  tool  for  carrying  out  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  conditions  for  renewable 
energy  deployment  in  a  particular  country.  The  RRA  is  a  country-led,  consultative  process.  It  provides  a  venue  for 
multi-stakeholder dialogue to identify challenges to renewable energy deployment and to devise solutions to existing 
barriers.  Short-  and  medium-term  recommendations  are  presented  to  governments  to  guide  the  formation  of  new 
policies or the reform of existing policies to establish a more conducive enabling environment for renewable energy. 
The RRA also consolidates existing efforts and mobilises resources for priority action. Since 2011, the RRA methodology 
has been used to conduct more than 30 country assessments, often resulting in extensive stakeholder engagement and 
improvements in policies and institutional frameworks (IRENA, 2013, 2022). 
The  RRA  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  provides  a  rigorous  assessment  of  ground  conditions,  including  the  enabling 
environment and the potential for growth of the renewable energy market. The assessment determines that there is a 
strong case for diversification of the country’s power mix towards medium-sized and small hydropower, and towards 
renewables in end-use energy sectors such as transport and heating. Finally, to help the Kyrgyz Republic accelerate the 
deployment of renewables, it provides a range of recommendations including policy measures and initiatives, rooted 
in extensive analysis and stakeholder input.
12
The RRA has been enriched through the guidance and inputs of the MOEI, the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) and other stakeholders. An initial expert consultation workshop, co-organised by the MOEI, IRENA and the 
UNDP  in  April  2021,  helped  lay  the  foundations  of  the  RRA.  The  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  RRA  were 
discussed in a validation workshop co-organised by IRENA, the MOEI and the UNDP in February 2022. 
The  RRA  included  three  special  objectives:  contributing  inputs  to  the  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (NDCs) 
process; an assessment of the potential of wind and solar photovoltaic (PV); and capacity building in the setting of 
renewable energy targets. IRENA prepared an NDC note in January 2021 to contribute to the NDC updating efforts of 
the UNDP and the GoK. A detailed assessment of the solar and wind energy potential of the country has been added 
to the RRA. Finally, an activity to build capacity in setting renewable energy targets was carried out in March 2022.

2.  ENERGY SECTOR CONTEXT
The energy sector has played an important role in the socio-economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic. As the Kyrgyz 
population  continues  to  increase  and  the  economy  grows,  energy  consumption  has  been  increasing.  Kyrgyz  energy 
consumption far exceeds domestic production, which leads to costly fuel imports, and makes the transition towards clean 
fuels a key imperative for decision making in the sector. 
2.1  Energy consumption and production 
The 2000-2010 decade was characterised by an economic crisis and social unrest, which slowed growth in energy 
demand.  A  relative  boom  in  economic  growth  from  2010  onwards  has  boosted  energy  demand.  Final  energy 
consumption increased by 33% in the 2000-2010 decade compared to growth of 54% in the 2010-2019 period. Total 
final consumption stood at 3.5 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) in 2019 (Figure 2.1).

The main energy consumers include the residential, industry and transport sectors, representing 66%, 14% and 11% of 
consumption, respectively. They are followed by the commercial/public sector,4 agriculture/forestry and non-energy 
use, all with much smaller shares of consumption. Consumption in the industry and transport sectors has undergone 
significant  fluctuations,  some  of  which  could  be  explained  through  changes  in  levels  of  economic  activity,  while 
others could be due to statistical methodologies.5 The energy consumed by the residential sector, however, has grown 
consistently and rapidly, tripling during the 2000-2010 period and more than quadrupling between 2010 and 2019. This 
increase can be attributed to improving living standards coupled with the rising demand for heating.
Final energy consumption is composed of oil products, electricity, coal, natural gas and heat. Oil products account for 
around 40% of consumption, followed by electricity at 30%. Coal, heat and natural gas account for 16%, 8% and 4%, 
respectively, of final demand.
4  Includes energy supplied for construction, installation and drilling works and for communal and cultural needs.
5 
In 2019, for instance, new legislation restricted fuel imports to only those for private use. Thus, despite similar or greater demand  
from the transport sector, consumption fell dramatically and the bulk of it shifted to the residential sector (according to IEA data).
 
14
The fuel mix seen in final demand (Figure 2.2) has undergone a significant shift since 2000 when electricity was the 
dominant contributor with 41%, followed by oil products at 24% and coal at 12%. A very limited amount of hydroelectric 
capacity was put into operation in recent decades, while the consumption of coal and mazut (heavy fuel oil) increased 
for heat generation. Consequently, coal’s market share increased to 16% in 2019 due to the availability of relatively cheap 
local coal reserves while that of electricity declined to 30%. Shares of natural gas also decreased slightly from 10% to 
8% between 2000 and 2019 due to reduced availability and higher prices. Simultaneously, the share of oil products in 
final consumption increased to 41% by 2019 due to the country’s growing vehicle fleet. Another negative trend is the 
smaller share of heat energy in final consumption (14% to 4%), revealing that the country did not fully utilise the potential 
of  its  two  combined  heat  and  power  plants  in  Bishkek  and  Osh  and  the  district  heating  systems  in  other  small  cities 
(Energy Charter, 2018; IEA, 2020b).
The shift towards oil is also evident in the mix of the total primary energy supply. As Figure 2.3 shows, the energy supplied 
by hydropower stagnated at around 1.1 mtoe, while that from oil and coal more than doubled. Consequently, the share of 
hydropower declined from 43% to 30% between 2000 and 2019, whereas that of oil increased from 16% to 37%. The share 
of coal supply also increased from 18% to 26% due to domestic consumption and rising exports to neighbouring countries 
(China, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan).
Overall, the total primary energy supply increased by 13% during the 2000-2010 period, followed by a more rapid increase of 
39% from 2010 to 2019 – which is consistent with consumption and economic growth patterns during these periods (Figure 
2.3). Oil, hydropower and coal were the key sources in 2019 accounting for 37%, 30% and 26%, respectively (IEA, 2020b).

The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  among  the  most  energy-intensive  countries  in  the  world.  According  to  the  International 
Energy Agency, in 2019 the energy intensity of GDP was 0.19 toe per USD 1 000, as compared with a world average of 
0.12 toe, 0.11 toe for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, 0.15 toe for China 
and 0.20 toe for Eastern Europe and Eurasia as well as neighbouring Kazakhstan. Energy intensity leads to persistent 
energy shortages and also reduces economic productivity and competitiveness (IEA, 2020b; World Bank, 2017b)
2.2  Electricity sector
The  power  sector  faces  the  challenging  task  of  meeting  rising  electricity  demand.  The  sector  also  contributes  to 
the  socio-economic  growth  of  the  region  through  the  electricity  trade.  The  dominant  role  of  hydropower  leads  to 
strong  interlinkages  between  water  and  power,  posing  challenges  to  decision  makers  in  the  power  sector.  Ageing 
infrastructure, power sector entities’ lack of financial viability, energy losses and limited new generation are other key 
challenges, which tend to reduce the quality and reliability of electricity.
Electricity consumption
Power  consumption  per  capita,  despite  limitations  imposed  by  power  shortages,  grew  by  close  to  45%  from  2010, 
reaching 2 megawatt hours (MWh)/capita in 2019. In the broader context of Central Asia, the per capita electricity 
consumption  of  the  country  is  slightly  higher  than  neighbouring  Tajikistan  (1.7  MWh/capita)  and  Uzbekistan 
(1.8  MWh/capita)  but  lower  than  Kazakhstan  (5.2  MWh/capita)  and  Turkmenistan  (2.8  MWh/capita)  (IEA,  2020a, 
2020b).  The  increasing  per  capita  electricity  consumption  can  be  attributed  to  several  factors  including  increased 
living standards and electrification of heating demand.
Electricity  consumption  increased  by  around  75%  between  2010  and  2019,  reaching  12.4  terawatt  hours  (TWh) 
(Figure 2.4). Demand from the residential sector increased by 152% between 2010 and 2019, reaching two-thirds of total 
electricity consumption in 2019. The increasing demand for electric heating in the residential sector was a key driver 
of this trend; other factors include improved living standards and subsidised tariff structures. The industrial sector with 
close to 18% of total demand was the second-largest power consumer in 2019. Demand in the sector increased by 24% 
from 2010 due to ongoing economic recovery, but remained well below the levels seen in 2000. Demand from the 
agricultural sector steadily declined, with the electricity intensity of agricultural GDP falling by almost 93% from 2000, 
and 45% from 2010 (IEA, 2020b).

Generation and trade
Total electricity generation has been increasing to address the rise in domestic demand and export requirements. In 
2019, total generation was estimated at around 15 TWh, which is a 24% increase over 2010 but only slightly higher than 
in 2000 (Figure 2.5). The bulk of this generation (92%) was supplied by hydroelectric power plants followed by small 
contributions from coal- and fuel-oil-fired power plants (7% and 1%, respectively). While hydropower has always been 
the dominant technology for electricity generation, fossil-fuel-based generation has gradually shifted from gas to coal 
since 2000. This shift is due to shortages in gas supply from Uzbekistan, starting in 2003 due to large debts owed by 
the Kyrgyzgas company to Uzbek counterparts (Yusupkhanova, 2003). In 2014, Kyrgyzsgas was sold to Gazprom, after 
which some gas imports from Uzbekistan were restored. Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation and Uzbekistan are the 
key sources of gas for the Kyrgyz Republic (Pirani, 2019; Vedomosti, 2014).

Note: GWh = gigawatt hour.
The installed capacity of the country stood at 3 982 megawatts (MW) in 2020 and primarily comprised:
• 
seven large hydropower plants ranging from 40 MW to 1 200 MW, at a combined capacity of 3 067 MW, located 
on the Naryn and Bashy rivers;
• 
nineteen small hydropower plants ranging from 0.26 to 8.7 MW, with a total capacity of 54 MW, located on the 
Alamedin, Chu and other small rivers; and
• 
two combined heat and power plants with a total capacity of 862 MW (Bishkek, 812 MW; Osh, 50 MW).
The country’s hydropower production fluctuates seasonally, which significantly affects power reliability. Power supply is 
typically most reliable in spring and summer, when it satisfies national energy demand and even provides electricity for 
export. During the autumn-winter period, the country stores water in dams (instead of maximising power generation) 
to  meet  downstream  irrigation  requirements  in  the  spring  season  (Imanaliyeva,  2021;  Zeng  et al.,  2017).6  Moreover, 
rainfall  and  glacial  meltwater  tend  to  decline  in  the  winter  months.  The  resulting  shortfall  in  power  generation  in 
autumn and winter is addressed through imports of electricity (mainly from Kazakhstan). This seasonality coupled with 
trends in domestic demand have a significant impact on the electricity trade. In 2013, for instance, all generation was 
used to fulfil domestic demand and in 2014 the country moved from being a net electricity exporter to a net electricity 
importer. In 2017 and 2018, however, high water levels meant that the country was a net exporter of power. In 2021, 
severe  drought  resulted  in  significant  challenges  to  the  food  and  energy  security  of  the  country  and  the  broader 
region. Prospective plans include the construction of 8 cascades of 34 hydroelectric power plants with a total installed 
capacity of 6 450 MW.
6  During the Soviet era, electricity was supplied to the Kyrgyz Soviet Republic by the Kazakh and Uzbek Soviet Republics in autumn and  
  winter.  In  spring  and  summer,  with  reservoir  gates  wide  open,  the  Kyrgyz  Soviet  Republic  supplied  water  and  electricity  to  its  
  neighbours.
17
As domestic electricity demand continues to increase and investments in new generation capacity are lacking, exports 
of electricity are likely to decline in future. 
The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  part  of  the  Central  Asian  Power  System,  which  connects  it  with  Kazakhstan,  Tajikistan  and 
Uzbekistan.  Future  projects  such  as  the  Central  Asia–South  Asia  power  project  (CASA-1000),  aim  to  take  regional 
power sector integration further by connecting the electricity-exporting Central Asian countries including the Kyrgyz 
Republic and Tajikistan with Afghanistan and Pakistan to export surplus summer electricity. Project implementation 
started  with  the  construction  of  generation  and  transmission  infrastructure  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan, 
Afghanistan and Pakistan (CASA-1000, 2021; USAID, 2021). Further investments in the Kyrgyz power sector to increase 
generation capacity, while simultaneously decreasing the intensity of domestic demand, could help ensure that the 
country benefits from the power trade opportunities offered by the project. 
Infrastructure and tariffs
The bulk of investment in the Kyrgyz power sector was carried out in the Soviet era, which means that about 45% 
of  available  generation  capacity  is  beyond  its  useful  service  life,  and  transmission  and  distribution  assets  are  also 
deteriorating. The largest power distributor in the country, Severelectro, for instance, reported in 2016 that close to 
40% of the underground cables in Bishkek required urgent replacement. Old assets and infrastructure, especially when 
undermaintained,  could  put  supply  reliability  and  quality  at  risk  (World  Bank,  2017b).  In  2018-2019,  around  43%  of 
firms reported experiencing power outages, and around 34% reported that they own or share a generator (World Bank, 
2022).
The power system needs significant investment to maintain ageing equipment or develop the capacity required to meet 
growing demand. This is unlikely under current conditions since the system is not viable from a financial standpoint 
and is kept functioning through inputs from the government budget. Subsidies on retail prices are at the heart of the 
financial issues faced by the power and energy sector (World Bank, 2017b).
The retail tariffs for power in the Kyrgyz Republic are among the lowest in the world. This incentivises an inefficient 
energy  consumption  pattern.  The  resulting  lack  of  revenue  leads  to  underinvestment  in  infrastructure  and  severe 
underspending on maintenance. Consequently, the reliability and quality of the power system suffers (Holzhacker and 
Skakova, 2019). The decline in reliability is most evident in the winter season, when the gap between the available 
generation capacity and rising demand emerges (World Bank, 2017b).
Large  residential  consumers  (above  700  kilowatt-  hour  [kWh]  consumption)  and  non-residential  consumers  pay 
tariffs (2.16 and 2.52 KGS/kWh [2.5 and 3 US cents (USDc)/kWh],7 respectively) that are above cost-recovery levels 
(1.97 and 1.55 KGS/kWh [2.3 and 1.8 USDc/kWh], respectively) and cross-subsidise small residential consumers, who pay 
tariffs (0.77 KGS/kWh [0.9 USDc/kWh]) that are below cost-recovery levels. Small residential consumers account for 
more than half of total consumption, which means that the average tariff remains below cost recovery and the sector’s 
revenue continues to be offset by the cost of power production and delivery (Rosenthal, Gassner and Hankinson, 2017). 
Several tariff reforms have been designed in recent years. Concerns about poverty and affordability have repeatedly 
held back implementation (Holzhacker and Skakova, 2019). The latest of such reforms has increased tariffs for non-
residential customers by 0.4 USDc/kWh to 3 USDc/kWh, but has decreased the tariff for low-income families receiving 
a monthly allowance for needy citizens (families) with children under 16, down to 0.5 KGS/kWh (0.59 USDc/kWh) in 
October 2021 (SARFEC, 2021). 
Governance of the power sector
Until 2001, the Kyrgyz electricity system was operated by a vertically integrated state-owned company, Kyrgyzenergo, 
which  was  responsible  for  all  power  generation,  transportation,  distribution  and  supply.  From  2001,  the  Kyrgyz 
electricity sector was legally unbundled to create two generating companies (called Electric Power Stations and the 
Chakan Hydropower Plant); one transmission company responsible for dispatch and market operations (the National 
Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan); and four distribution and supply companies (Severelectro, Vostokelectro, Oshelectro and 
Jalal-Abadelectro) (Energy Charter, 2018). All were formed as joint-stock companies (JSCs).
In 2016, the sector underwent a new reform aiming to increase the operational efficiency of the power system. The 
government established a new company, the Energy Holding Company (EHC), an open JSC, which became responsible 
for  the  efficient  operation  of  all  electricity  producers  and  transmission  and  distribution  companies.  At  the  time  of 
writing, all the above-mentioned eight companies, created as part of the unbundling reforms during the period 1997-
2001, still exist and operate. Their stocks, however, belong to the EHC, which is now a part of the Ministry of Energy.

Electricity tariffs are set by the regulator, the State Agency for Regulation of the Fuel and Energy Complex (SARFEC), 
now also a part of the Ministry of Energy. 
The  Kyrgyz  Energy  Settlement  Center,  an  open  JSC,  provides  paid  services  to  participants  in  the  electrical  energy 
market. The centre uses an analytical system to collect, process, verify and analyse data on power flows, electricity 
losses and reliability. It develops electricity balances, and monitors settlements for all participants in the electricity 
market (UNECE, 2018).
2.3  Heating sector
Given the cold climate, access to reliable heat supply is important for the well-being of the Kyrgyz population. Heating 
demand is fulfilled by various fuels and technologies ranging from large, centralised district heating systems to large 
and small heat-only boilers (HOBs, or boiler houses) to individual heating systems.
The  nature  of  heating  demand  varies  a  lot  across  large  cities  (Bishkek  and  Osh)  and  smaller  cities  and  rural  areas. 
Stoves, often fuelled by dried dung, wood and coal, are the main sources of heating for rural households and urban 
households outside large cities. Low-income households often use coal with wood or dung (in rural settings). Higher-
income  households  typically  use  coal  with  electricity  or  wood  (World  Bank,  2020).  These  stoves  often  tend  to  be 
inefficient (with efficiency rates of 25% to 40% as opposed to 60% to 80% for high-efficiency models) and lead to 
significant  indoor  air  pollution.  As  a  result,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  among  the  European  and  Central  Asian  nations 
most affected by diseases resulting from indoor air pollution. In urban households outside Bishkek, stoves (50%) are 
followed by electric heating (37%) and district heating (9%) in popularity. In Bishkek, close to 43% of households rely 
on district heating as a main source of heating, followed by electricity (21%) and stoves (22%) (Balabanyan et al., 2015).
Small HOBs provide heat for buildings that are not linked to the district heating systems. Nearly 300 HOBs are operated 
by district heating companies, half of which are fuelled by coal, and around a further 2 500 small HOBs are owned and 
operated by public institutions and used to heat public buildings. These are largely fuelled by coal and electricity in 
fairly equal shares (Balabanyan et al., 2015).
About  95%  of  the  heat  energy  provided  by  the  country’s  district  heating  systems  is  consumed  for  household  and 
municipal needs. The remaining heat is supplied to the industrial sector. The total consumption of heat energy supplied 
by district heating systems decreased by about 10% in the past decade, which is primarily due to the decreasing demand 
of industrial consumers, driven by the unreliability of the deteriorating district heating network (Energy Charter, 2018). 
Fuel consumption in the heating sector
Heat production from combined heat and power plants and boiler houses remained unchanged from 2010 to 2018. 
Combined heat and power plants in Bishkek and Osh (Bishkekteplosetj and the Osh municipal company Teplosnabjenie) 
account for three-quarters of heat production.
Most of the district heating systems and HOBs in the Kyrgyz Republic were originally designed for natural gas. The 
collapse of the Soviet Union led to gas becoming scarcer and more expensive. Therefore, district heating systems and 
HOBs were converted to run on coal, mazut or electricity. The district heating companies are initiating several projects 
to switch fuels from coal, mazut and electricity to natural gas. Overall, four types of fuels are used by the district heating 
systems: coal, mazut (heavy, low-quality fuel oil), electricity and natural gas (Energy Charter, 2018). Renewables such 
as solar thermal and biomass are also viable candidates for fuelling heat generation. The Gagarin, Orto-Say and Rotor 
boiler  houses’  solar  pilot  projects  in  Bishkek  have  shown  that  solar  thermal  can  be  successfully  incorporated  into 
existing heating infrastructure to reduce fossil fuel consumption and emissions (see Box 2.1 for details) (SAEPF, 2020). 
The combined heat and power plant in Bishkek is primarily fuelled by coal, whereas the one based in Osh has been 
performing as an HOB since 2014. 
The boiler houses (HOBs) are primarily fuelled by coal and electricity, but some also use gas and fuel oil/mazut (SAEPF, 
2020). 
Households not connected to the district heating system started to increase their reliance on electricity for heating as 
gas became increasingly expensive and scarce after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Households connected to district 
heating also use electricity as a supplementary source of heat. The resulting increase in power demand strains the grid 
and decreases the reliability of supply during the winter months (Balabanyan et al., 2015).

Box  2.1  Solar-assisted  district  heating:  The 
Gagarin, Orto-Say and Rotor boiler houses
Bishkekteploenergo began operating a combined solar 
and natural gas pilot project as part of the refurbishment 
of the Gagarin, Orto-Say and Rotor boiler houses. The 
Gagarin pilot project involved the substitution of two old 
coal-fired boilers with modern oil- and gas-fired units 
combined  with  an  installation  of  800  square  metres 
(364  panels  at  0.5  megawatt  thermal  [MWth])  of 
solar thermal panels on the roof of a boiler house and 
hot  water  storage  capacity  of  40  cubic  metres  (m3). 
The Orto-Say and Rotor boiler houses received 120 and 
396 panels (0.168 MWth and 0.6 MWth, respectively). 
The  renovation  of  the  boiler  houses  significantly 
decreased  gas  consumption  resulting  in  savings  of 
42.7  trillion  m3  and  10  trillion  m3  in  Gagarin  and 
Orto-Say, respectively.

Infrastructure and tariffs
Access to reliable and affordable heat is critical to the good health and well-being of the people of the Kyrgyz Republic. 
The heating sector suffers from a host of interlinked issues including a significant supply-demand gap, insufficient and 
unreliable supply, ageing infrastructure, lack of financial viability and inefficiencies in both generation and end use.
The  centralised  infrastructure  used  for  heating  in  urban  areas  is  deteriorating.  Most  of  the  district  heating  assets 
(combined heat and power plants, boilers and distribution networks) were built more than 20 years ago. As in the 
power sector, inadequate investments in replacement and maintenance mean that this infrastructure is deteriorating. 
Consequently,  assets  often  end  up  operating  at  20%  to  50%  of  their  name-plate  capacity,  with  losses  exceeding  a 
quarter of generation. Service quality has also declined. In 2013, district heating customers in Bishkek suffered more 
than 300 outages (Rosenthal, Gassner and Hankinson, 2017). 
The demand side also suffers from significant efficiency issues. The building stock is old and has low energy performance. 
Around half of the residential building stock in the country was built before 1980, and around three-quarters was built 
before 2004. The inefficiency of the building stock is compounded by subsidised tariffs leading to excessive energy 
consumption in the sector (Energy Charter, 2018).
The lack of cost-reflective tariffs is one of the root causes of the above-mentioned challenges, i.e. ageing infrastructure 
and inefficiencies on the demand side. Heat tariffs are below cost-recovery levels, which means that most suppliers lack 
the necessary funds for proper maintenance – leading to decaying infrastructure. 
Residential heating tariffs are estimated at around 13% to 50% (based on the source of heat) of the supply cost. Only 
25% of heat consumption is metered, and the billing for consumers without meters is based on parameters that are 
not linked to energy consumption. Thus, the system fails to provide price signals for efficient energy use (Balabanyan 
et  al.,  2015;  Energy  Charter,  2018).  In  metered  systems,  the  heating  price  is  set  at  1 134.76  KGS/gigacalorie 
(143 USD/toe), which is a fraction of the cost of delivery. The cost of heat generation in Bishkek in 2017, for instance, 
was 3 741.2 KGS/gigacalorie (472 USD/toe). The cost differential is borne by the city and government budget (SAEPF, 
2020). 
In 2021, the tariffs for non-residential customers of the Bishkek heating system were increased to 1 802 KGS/gigacalorie 
to account for inflation.
20
Governance of the heating sector
The State Agency for Regulation of the Fuel and Energy Complex (SARFEC) under the GoK’s Ministry of Energy and 
Industry is the energy regulator of the country and is also responsible for setting tariffs for the electricity, natural gas 
and district heating sectors. 
The  Kyrgyz  Republic’s  district  heating  sector  is  mainly  owned  and  governed  by  state  and  municipally  owned 
enterprises operating in the capital and other big cities (see Table 2.1). Municipal governments own the district heating 
infrastructure in Osh, Tokmok and the western part of Bishkek. Combined heat and power plants that provide district 
heating in eastern Bishkek and Osh are owned by the EHC. Kyrgyzteploenergo, which are state enterprises under the 
State Committee, are responsible for district heat in Tokmok, Kyzyl-Kiya, Karakol and other small cities (Energy Charter, 
2018). 
Overall,  heat  supply  enterprises  (such  as  Kyrgyzteploenergo,  Bishkekteploenergo  and  Osh  MP)  operate  around 
277  HOBs,  local  self-government  bodies  own  398  HOBs  and  public  institutions  and  departments  own  around  2013 
HOBs, which are primarily used for public buildings (Energy Charter, 2018; SAEPF, 2020).

2.4  Transport sector
While the transport sector involves various modes (rail, road, air and water), roads dominate. 
The transport sector is one of the main sources of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the 
country.  The  sector  accounted  for  around  a  quarter  of  final  energy  consumption  in  2015.  The  sector  accounted  for 
around 31% of energy sector emissions in the country (SAEPF, 2016).
Nearly all the fuel consumed by the sector is either gasoline or diesel, with the share of gasoline being slightly larger 
than that of diesel. Gasoline is primarily used in private cars, whereas diesel is the fuel of choice for vehicles engaged 
in agriculture, construction, freight and public transport. More recently, the demand for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) 
in the transport sector is also rising (Kabar, 2022a).
The  growth  in  vehicle  ownership  and  population  means  that  the  consumption  of  transport  fuels  continues  to  rise. 
Between 2015 and 2018, the consumption of gasoline and diesel increased by 20% and 40% reaching 792 000 and 
750 000 tonnes, respectively (SAEPF, 2020).
Given  the  lack  of  significant  domestic  reserves  of  hydrocarbons,  fuel  consumption  in  the  transport  sector  leads  to 
almost complete dependence on energy imports. The transition towards more sustainable means of transportation is 
a key focus of the Kyrgyz government. In this context, greater adoption of public transport and electric vehicles offer 
a way to reduce wasteful fuel consumption and local pollution. The Kyrgyz Republic already has a zero customs duty 
on the import of electric vehicles and is also introducing tax and customs incentives on vehicles with hybrid engines 
(SAEPF, 2020). As of now, there are no initiatives by the government to develop charging stations.
21
2.5  Energy sector policy framework
The State Committee on Industry, Energy and Subsoil Use (GKPEN) was charged to design and implement a holistic 
state policy for the energy sector, covering the sector’s linkages with the water-food nexus, fuel resources, renewable 
energy sources and the potential for industrial value creation. In 2016, the committee was replaced by the Ministry of 
Energy and Industry in 2020, renamed the Ministry of Energy in 2021 (IEA, 2020a). 
Strategic framework
The  main  policy  documents  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  that  regulate  the  energy  sector  include  the  Law  of  the  Kyrgyz 
Republic  on  “Energy”,  “Electric  Power  Industry”  and  “Energy  Conservation”.  The  following  documents  collectively 
create the strategic framework of the Kyrgyz energy sector: 
•  National Energy Programme of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2008-2010 and the Fuel and Energy Complex Development 
Strategy until 2025.
• 
• 
•  Mid-Term Power Sector Development Strategy for 2012-2017.
•  National Sustainable Development Strategy for 2013-2017.
•  National Development Strategy for 2018-2040.
•  Concept of the Green Economy of the Kyrgyz Republic.
•  Green Economy Development Program in the Kyrgyz Republic for 2019-2023.
•  National Development Program of the Kyrgyz Republic until 2026.
Law on Renewable Energy, 2008.
Law on Energy Efficiency of Buildings, 2011.
The  National  Development  Strategy  in  particular  sets  out  the  strategic  vision  for  a  sustainable  energy  sector 
(GoK, 2018):
• 
The  Kyrgyz  Republic  aims  to  comprise  a  major  regional  power  producer  that  sustainably  develops  its  energy 
sector, promotes energy efficiency and ensures reliable delivery of energy to all consumers.
•  Activities related to the CASA-1000 project will be prioritised. 
• 
Environmentally friendly energy sources (small hydropower, solar PV and wind energy, solar collectors, biogas, 
heat pumps, etc.) were targeted at more than 10% of the total national energy mix.
• 
• 
•  Mandatory requirements will be used to increase efficiency of power facilities.
• 
Indicators for energy generation and consumption will be improved to approach those of the OECD countries.
Investment in the construction and reconstruction of large hydropower plants will be prioritised. 
Subsidies will be targeted to reduce consumption while improving quality of life.
The strategy sets out a goal for clean energy sources to be 10% of the total energy mix without specifying a target date. 
It is important to note that this does not include large hydropower. As noted in section 2.1, hydropower already accounts 
for 30% of the primary energy supply, but this is overwhelmingly large hydropower. Small hydropower contributed only 
about 1.5% of the total. Therefore, the target of 10% will require significant investments in small hydro as well as solar 
and wind energy technologies. 
The Law on Renewable Energy establishes the legal, organisational, economic and financial foundations and mechanisms 
for promoting the development and use of renewable energy sources in the country.
The Law on Energy Efficiency of Buildings No. 137 sets out the legal framework for reducing energy consumption in the 
building sector, and regulates the legal and organisational relations between building owners, certified professionals 
and government executive authorities.
A  concept  note  on  the  green  economy  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  establishes  the  overarching  guidelines  for  the  clean 
energy sector’s development and energy conservation (Ministry of Justice, 2018b). A green economy aims to decrease 
losses in the energy sector, reduce subsidies, cut reliance on coal and promote the development of technologies such 
as hydropower, solar, wind and bioenergy. Given the national obligations under the Sustainable Development Goals, 
the concept note establishes a vision for the energy sector until 2040, with a target of increasing the renewable energy 
share (small hydropower, solar, wind and biogas) to 10% of total power generation.
22
As part of the implementation of the concept note, the Green Economy Development Program in the Kyrgyz Republic 
for 2019-2023 was developed and accepted in 2019, together with an action plan and indicators for 2020-2023. The 
goal by 2023 is to reduce the energy intensity of GDP while increasing the access of citizens and economic entities to 
reliable and modern energy supply. Achieving this will be contingent on: (1) improving the system for assessing and 
monitoring the state of the energy sector; (2) strengthening energy policy; (3) increasing the transparency of fuel and 
energy prices and ensuring that energy companies break even; (4) improving the efficiency of energy consumption; 
(5) improving energy efficiency in buildings; (6) increasing the share of renewable energy sources in the total volume 
of final energy consumption; and (7) raising people’s awareness of energy savings and renewable energy sources.
The  National  Development  Program  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  until  2026  briefly  outlines  short-term  priorities  in  the 
implementation of the following projects:
•  Construction of large hydropower facilities Kambarata HPP-1, Upper Naryn HPP cascade, Suusamyr-Kokomeren 
HPP cascade, Kazarman HPP cascade, etc.
•  Construction of small hydropower plants.
• 
Implementation of the CASA-1000 project.
• 
• 
•  Development of alternative energy sources (solar and wind energy).
Phased transition of the state motor transport fleet to electric vehicles.
Implementation of a project on the energy efficiency of buildings.
Climate change 
The Kyrgyz Republic is among the most vulnerable countries to climate change. Increasing temperatures are already 
resulting in the greater duration and frequency of heatwaves. Changing temperatures and rainfall patterns could have 
severe impacts on the sensitive water and agricultural systems, with significant implications for the water-energy-food 
nexus.  Decision  makers  of  the  country  understand  the  importance  of  addressing  these  challenges  and  are  making 
every effort to ensure that relevant initiatives are successful. The country remains committed to addressing the global 
challenge of climate change.
The Kyrgyz Republic’s total GHG emissions (including land-use change and forestry [LUCF]) stood at 15.5 metric tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2eq) in 2017 compared to 7.3 MtCO2eq in 2000 and 30 MtCO2eq in 1990. While emissions 
have been increasing gradually since 2000, they remain well below the levels in 1990, which reflects the trends in the 
macroeconomic indicators as well as changes in the economy. The Kyrgyz Republic’s GHG emissions are relatively low 
as the country contributed just 0.035% of total global GHG emissions (excluding LUCF) in 2017, while its population was 
0.083% of the world’s total population. The per capita GHG emissions were less than one-third of the world average in 
2017. GHG emissions in 2017, excluding LUCF, were mainly from the energy sector (59%), followed by agriculture (32%), 
industrial processes (5%) and waste (4%). The transport and the electricity/heating sectors are included in the energy 
sector and account for 11% and 9% of total GHG emissions, respectively (OECD, 2019; WRI, 2020).
The Kyrgyz Republic has signed and ratified 13 international environmental conventions. It ratified the United Nations 
Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  in  January  2000  and  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  January  2003.  The  country 
partnered with Tajikistan and Turkmenistan in 2006 to further the regional climate effort by signing the Framework 
Convention on Environmental Protection for Sustainable Development in Central Asia (OECD, 2019). It signed the Paris 
Agreement on Climate Change in September 2016, followed by formal ratification in February 2020.
In  2015,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  submitted  its  Intended  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  (INDC),  outlining  both 
adaptation  and  mitigation  targets  and  actions.  As  part  of  mitigation  targets,  the  country  plans  to  reduce  GHG  gas 
emissions by up to 13.8% by 2030 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. If international support is forthcoming, 
a more ambitious goal aims to cut emissions by up to 31% by 2030 (Table 2.2). Agriculture, energy, water, emergencies 
(e.g. disaster risk management), health care, and forest and biodiversity have been identified as the key sectors for 
adaptation (OECD, 2019).

In  2021,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  adopted  an  updated  NDC,  outlining  plans  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  across  different 
economic sectors. The second NDC provides more ambitious targets for emissions reductions (Table 2.2) and identifies 
energy and agriculture as the key sectors for mitigation and adaptation measures. Interventions in the energy sector 
could  focus  on  greater  energy  conservation,  improved  efficiency,  and  investments  in  renewables  and  natural  gas 
(UNFCCC, 2021). 
Energy efficiency
The Law on Energy Conservation, enacted in 1998, sets out to increase the efficiency of the energy sector. It includes 
several important guidelines for establishing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks for energy efficiency. 
Most  of  those  guidelines,  however,  have  not  been  enforced  or  adopted  in  the  form  of  secondary  legislative  acts 
(Dikambaev, 2019).
The Law on Energy Efficiency in Buildings is a relatively new and progressive legislative act that was developed with 
the  technical  assistance  of  the  UNDP  and  Global  Environment  Facility  and  came  into  force  in  February  2012.  The 
law  is  aligned  with  the  European  Union’s  best  practices  and  based  on  the  key  requirements  of  the  Union’s  Energy 
Performance  in  Building  Directive.  It  contains  many  important  provisions  for  establishing  effective  institutional  and 
regulatory frameworks. Despite the adoption of the secondary legislation required by this law, its requirements have 
not been implemented or enforced effectively.
There are currently no laws or minimum energy performance standards and energy labelling schemes for household 
appliances  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  That  said,  there  are  some  Eurasian  Economic  Union  (EEU)  standards  on  energy 
efficiency and minimum energy performance standards for industrial energy-consuming appliances, such as motors 
and  pumps.  These  standards  were  adopted  by  the  Centre  for  Standardisation  and  Metrology  under  the  Ministry  of 
Economy (Kyrgyzstandard) before the Kyrgyz Republic acceded to the EEU in August 2015. Following the country’s 
official accession to the EEU, all EEU standards became applicable in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic.
The  State  Programme  on  Energy  Savings  and  Energy  Efficiency  Policy  for  2015-2017  introduced  energy  efficiency 
criteria for public procurement. However, provisions of the programme were not implemented.

3.  RENEWABLE ENERGY
Large hydropower is the backbone of the renewable energy landscape in the country and is responsible for meeting 
the  bulk  of  domestic  demand  and  electricity  exports  (see  Section  2.2).  Other  renewables  such  as  solar,  wind  and 
bioenergy are at the preliminary stages of deployment – often limited to relatively small applications (see Section 2.3 
and  Box  2.1).  Going  forward,  these  renewable  energy  technologies  could  play  a  more  prominent  role  in  addressing 
energy demand and increasing the resilience of the sector. 
3.1  Renewable energy resources
The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  considerable  and  diverse  renewable  energy  resources.  While  some  of  its  hydropower 
resources have been utilised, those for other renewables such as solar PV, wind and bioenergy remain largely untapped. 
It  is  estimated  that  small  hydropower  can  generate  5-8  TWh/year;  wind,  44.6  gigawatt  hours  (GWh)/year;  solar, 
490 million GWh/year and biomass power, 1.3 TWh/year (UNECE, 2018). 
Hydropower
According to a GoK concept note on developing small hydropower, the hydropower resources of the Kyrgyz Republic 
consist of 268 rivers, 97 large canals and 18 reservoirs, with a total electricity generation potential of 143 TWh per year. 
Today, about 10% of the potential is used. The hydropower potential of small rivers and waterways is about 5-8 TWh/year, 
of which the republic uses less than 1% (Ministry of Justice, 2018a). There is significant room for development in the Kyrgyz 
hydropower sector; some countries have been seen to tap over 30% of their hydropower potential (IMF, 2019).
Solar
IRENA’s preliminary assessment of solar PV resources in the country shows that more than 3 645 km2 of the area in the 
country has good suitability for solar PV (meaning that it has a suitability score of greater than 50%). The analysis further 
identifies three ideal zones (with a suitability score of greater than 75%) spanning a total of 26 km2, which can be used 
to deploy around 650 MW of utility-scale solar PV projects (see Annex Table A2 for details). The assessment reveals that 
the most suitable solar PV zones are clustered in the southern region of Osh along the river Kyzyl-Suu (Figure 3.1). These 
zones are close to the city of Osh, which would allow them to help address urban demand (IRENA, 2021b).

(protected areas, land features and population growth) criteria to determine suitable zones.

Wind
IRENA’s preliminary assessment indicates promising wind resources. Around 94 000 km2 have a suitability score higher 
than 50% for onshore wind. The analysis further identifies 77 ideal wind zones (more than 83% suitability score) spanning 
a total of 2 304 km2, which can be used to deploy around 5.8 GW of wind energy projects (see Annex Table A3 for details). 
Wind zones are clustered in the southern region of Osh along the border with Tajikistan, the northern and southern regions 
in Naryn and the southern region of Issyk-Kul. Other, sparse clusters are found in western Batken and southern Chuy 
(Figure 3.2) (IRENA, 2021b).

Geothermal
The Issyk-Kul region is home to the country’s main geothermal sources, with other resources in the Chui province. In 
areas with touristic resorts, these resources are occasionally used for heating and hot water supply. In other spots, 
they are primarily used as spas or for medicinal purposes. The geothermal resources have relatively low temperatures 
(of not more than 55-60°C) and are characterised by high mineral content, which leads to scaling and corrosion of 
materials – thus limiting their use (Baybagyshov and Degembaeva, 2019). 
3.2  Current status of renewable energy deployment
Renewable energy, in the form of large hydropower, dominates the power sector of the country. Other renewables such 
as solar PV, wind and bioenergy are virtually non-existent in the electricity mix. The transport and heating sectors are 
dominated by fossil fuels. 
Electricity  generation  is  driven  by  large  hydropower,  which  accounts  for  92%  of  the  total  production.  The  large 
hydropower fleet, which consists of seven large dam hydropower plants ranging from 40 MW to 1 200 MW, account 
for most of this generation. Almost all of these dams are located on the Naryn river. Small hydropower constitutes 
below 1.5% of total electricity generation, produced by 19 small hydroelectric power plants with a total capacity of 
54 MW (total generation of 54 GWh). These small power plants are located on the Alamedin, Chu and other small rivers 
(Vedeneva, 2020). 
Developing small hydropower plants is one of the Kyrgyz government’s top priorities due to the potential to cut down 
emissions  as  well  as  fuel  imports.  Greater  adoption  of  small  hydropower  also  represents  a  move  back  to  the  past, 
when small hydropower was a more significant generation technology. According to statistics, in 1960 more than 100 
small hydroelectric power plants were operating in the Kyrgyz Republic with annual electricity generation of about 
26
285 GWh (as opposed to just 54 GWh). This was around a third of the total electricity generation in the country. It 
is estimated that the energy potential of small rivers in all regions allows for the construction of about 87 new small 
hydroelectric power plants with a total capacity of about 180 MW and average annual electricity generation of up to 
1 TWh (Ministry of Justice, 2018a; UNIDO, 2018).
A decree on a tendering process for the right to build small hydropower plants in the Kyrgyz Republic was announced 
in 2017. Shortly after, a tender for the right to construct 14 small hydropower plants was announced. While some tender 
results for these plants were announced, they have since been cancelled. 
As of now, there are no large solar power plants in the Kyrgyz Republic. Solar panels are used mainly in small enterprises 
and  households.  Some  pilot  solar  projects  have  been  carried  out  by  development  partners  and  donors.  Under  the 
United Nations’ Industrial Development Organization project “Reliable Energy Supply of Rural Health Post,” together 
with UNDP and the World Health Organization, solar installations ranging from 3 kW to 1.5 kW were set up at 19 rural 
health facilities in the country to support the provision of reliable medical services (UNECE, 2018). Plans are set to 
construct  a  1 000  MW  solar  power  plant  in  the  Issyk-Kul  region,  with  investment  agreements  signed  between  the 
government and Chinese investors (Kudryavtseva, 2022). 
Solar energy technologies are also being used in pilot district heating projects. The Republican Fund for Environmental 
Protection and the State Agency for Environmental Protection and Forestry provided co-financing at the request of KP 
Bishkekteploenergo for the installation of solar collectors in 2017-2019. In 2017, 364 solar thermal panels with a total 
capacity of 0.5 megawatt thermal (MWth) were installed on the administrative territory of KP Bishkekteploenergo. In 
2017, 120 panels with a total capacity of 0.168 MWth were installed in the Orto-Say boiler house, and in 2019 396 solar 
thermal  panels  with  a  total  capacity  of  0.6  MWth  were  put  into  operation  in  the  Rotor  boiler  house  (SAEPF,  2020; 
UN ESCAP, forthcoming). 
The  UNDP’s  Small  and  Medium  Business  Development  Project  on  Energy  Access,  implemented  by  the  Center  for 
Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Development, has also helped start 11 renewable energy and energy efficiency 
projects.  This  includes  the  installation  of  PV  systems  for  a  kindergarten  in  Isfana,  heat  pumps  in  health  facilities  in 
Sulukta and Zhin-Zhigen (UNDP, 2021a, 2021b) and solar water heaters in several schools across the country (UNDP, 
2020). 
Commercial  installation  of  renewable  energy  systems  includes  off-grid  PV,  solar  water  heating  systems  and  biogas 
plants, but is limited to 10-20 installations of small capacity per year. 
3.3  Renewable energy policies and regulation
Legislation  governing  the  management  of  the  system  for  provision  of  electricity  services  using  renewable  energy 
sources  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  includes  the  Law  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  on  Energy  (1996),  the  Law  of  the  Kyrgyz 
Republic on Electricity, the Law of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  on Renewable  Energy Sources and several other legal acts 
including the Civil, Land, Water Codes of the Kyrgyz Republic. These last acts regulate aspects of system management 
for the provision of electricity services using renewable energy sources.
The Law of the Kyrgyz Republic on Energy defined the general principles of organising and regulating the activities of 
entities in the fuel and energy complex. The law defines renewable energy resources as “resources that arise naturally, are 
constantly renewed by nature and can be converted into energy, including geothermal, solar, water and wind energy”.
In  1997,  the  Law  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  on  Electrical  Energy  was  adopted,  aimed  at  ensuring  a  reliable,  safe  and 
uninterrupted  supply  of  electricity  and  heat;  improving  the  quality  of  service;  creating  a  competitive  environment; 
forming an energy market; encouraging private sector development and attracting investment. This law is aimed at 
regulating the activities of generating, supplying and distributing companies (with any form of ownership) to the end 
consumer. Article 5 of the law states that the production of renewables-based electricity as well as the production of 
electricity (from any energy source) for own use with a capacity of up to 1 MW is not licensed.
At the same time, the sale of electricity, including import and export, is carried out based on a license issued by the 
authorised body for regulating the fuel and energy complex, for any person, regardless of the organisational legal form 
and type of ownership (Article 18 of the law).
Special  regulation  in  the  field  of  renewables  is  carried  out  through  the  Law  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  on  Renewable 
Energy Sources (2008). According to the preamble, the law defines the legal, organisational, economic and financial 
framework;  the  mechanisms  governing  the  relations  between  the  state,  generators,  suppliers  and  consumers  of 
renewable energy; as well as the production equipment for the use of renewables. It also contains the definition of 
renewable energy sources (UNECE, 2018).
27
By the order of the State Agency for Regulation of the Fuel and Energy Complex under the Government of the Kyrgyz 
Republic dated 6 August 2015, No. 1, a methodology for calculating tariffs for electricity supplied by stations generating 
it from renewable energy sources was adopted.
It is also worth noting that the development of renewables was included in the National Energy Program of the Kyrgyz 
Republic for 2008-2010 and the Strategy for the Development of the Fuel and Energy Complex until 2025 as one of 
the most important measures for ensuring energy security. These documents proposed to complete the rehabilitation 
and  reconstruction  of  existing  small  hydropower  stations  and  to  build  new,  small  hydropower  plants  totalling 
178 MW of installed capacity by 2010. The annual average production from renewables was to reach 1 billion kWh/year,  
which  could  be  achieved  through  increasing  yearly  production  by  local  manufacturers  of  solar  collectors 
(up  to  100 000-150 000  m2),  the  addition  of  micro  hydropower  plants  up  to  2-2.5  MW/year,  PV  modules  up  to 
2-3 MW/year and cumulative installation of wind power stations up to 250 MW. The overall costs of these projects were 
estimated at around KGS 520-950 billion (USD 13-25 billion). Planned growth of the electricity tariff was supposed to 
ensure the competitiveness of planned small hydropower plants and renewable energy. 
According to another policy document, the Program of Development of Small and Medium Power Plants up to 2012, 
accepted in October 2008, a wind farm with a capacity of 22 MW was to be built near Balykchy city in Issyk-Kul oblast, 
and small hydropower plants totalling 255.25 MW were to be reconstructed and built. Unfortunately, none of the policy 
documents accepted in 2008 were implemented, as there was no development of secondary legislation, needed to 
provide implementation mechanisms.
Measures for the implementation of the Medium-Term Strategy for the Development of the Power Sector  (2012-2017)
were accepted in May 2012. These included plans for the construction of four small hydropower plants by 2017 within 
the framework of a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development project. 
Also in 2012, much-needed amendments to the Law on Renewable Energy were introduced. Producers of renewable 
energy were to gain several important advantages, creating favourable conditions for attracting investments. These 
amendments included:
•  Guaranteed connection to the grid for installations producing renewable energy.
•  Guaranteed purchase of all renewable electricity produced by distribution companies throughout the project.
• 
Tariffs  for  energy  equivalent  to  the  maximum  amount  fixed  by  the  retail  tariffs,  with  increasing  coefficients, 
differentiated by the type of renewable energy (introduced by amending the law in 2012).
•  A preferential fixed rate for up to 8 years from the date of plant commissioning.
• 
• 
The removal of licensing requirements for renewable energy projects.
Import duties set at 0% for renewable-energy-related equipment (introduced by amending the law in 2012).
In 2015, the Concept of Small Hydropower Development of the Kyrgyz Republic until 2017 was accepted. The development 
of the Concept was planned within the framework of the Program for the Transition of the Republic to Sustainable 
Development for 2013-2017. However, secondary legislation to support implementation was not forthcoming.
In 2018, the next developmental phase of renewable energy legislation started. The National Development Strategy 
2018-2040 indicates a target of 10% for renewables (excluding large hydropower) in the energy mix. The target is not 
time bound and does not seem to be legally binding. Given that renewables’ share of the energy mix (excluding large 
hydropower) is negligible (<1.5% of electric generation), the target would remain elusive in the absence of concrete 
policies and regulations. 
The following main changes addressing several issues were introduced to the Renewable Energy Law in July 2019: 
•  Compensation  for  additional  costs  of  distributing  companies  for  the  purchase  of  electricity  generated  using 
renewable  energy  sources  will  be  considered  when  calculating  and  approving  the  national  electricity  tariff  for 
consumers, which reduces the financial load on distribution companies. 
• 
The  feed-in  tariffs  (FITs)  for  renewable  electricity  were  defined.  Renewable  electricity  will  be  compensated  at 
1.3 times the highest consumer tariff.
•  Quotas for renewable energy capacities were introduced for each region. The preferential tariffs (i.e. using the 
coefficient of 1.3 times the highest consumer tariff) could be availed by those who were registered under these 
quotas.
28
In 2020, the regulation “On conditions and procedure of generation and supply of energy with the use of renewable 
energy  sources”  was  introduced.  The  new  document  determines  the  rules  of  the  renewable  energy  market 
(Kudaiberdieva, 2020):
• 
The  responsibilities  of  the  stakeholders  are  identified.  GKPEN  determines  the  policy  in  the  renewable  energy 
sector, the State Agency for Fuel and Energy Complex regulates tariffs, while local governments address issues 
related to the allocation of land.
• 
The regulation described the procedures and requirements to be fulfilled by a “green” energy producer or supplier 
in order to become a market player, eligible for all preferences provided by the state.
• 
It introduces the concept of a register of renewable energy entities, which will be used to develop an official list of 
market players and their annual renewable energy generation.
•  Green energy production will be controlled through quotas. Electricity production through the allotted quotas will 
be eligible for a preferential tariff (i.e. using the coefficient of 1.3 times the highest consumer tariff).
•  A standard contract for the supply of green energy demanded by the banks for the loan issue procedure was 
developed.
• 
The  regulation  instructs  distribution  companies  to  procure  green  energy  from  producers  at  0.034  USD/kWh 
(or  1.3  x  2.24  KGS/kWh  [1.3  x  2.6  USDc/kWh]).  With  the  acceptance  of  the  new  medium-term  tariff  policy 
for  electricity  and  heat  for  2021-2025,  the  FIT  would  be  increased  with  the  tariff  to  0.0386  USD/kWh 
(or 1.3 x 2.52 KGS/kWh [1.3 x 2.97 USDc/kWh]).
While  the  policy  and  regulatory  structures  seem  to  be  in  place,  practical  implementation  of  the  regulation  is  still 
lagging due to the following: 
• 
3.86 USDc/kWh is not enough for most renewable energy technologies. Solar projects have just started touching 
3 USDc/kWh in locations with perfect conditions (in terms of resources, financing and regulation); it would be 
difficult to replicate those results in a new market with significant financial constraints. 
• 
The  institutional  responsibilities  are  still  not  clear.  The  quotas  have  not  been  defined  yet,  therefore  relevant 
authorities, having registered the first two batches of total of 63 developers, have proposed some changes to the 
newly accepted regulation to overcome dependence on quota definition by National Energy Holding. 
Acceptance  of  the  regulation  “On  conditions  and  procedure  of  generation  and  supply  of  energy  with  the  use  of 
renewable energy sources” led to an increase of interest in renewable energy generation from the private sector, and 
the Ministry of Energy has already issued certificates for being a green energy producer to:
• 
20  companies  on  15  November  2021,  which  received  48  certificates  for  renewable  energy  entities,  for  a  total 
planned capacity of 639.5 MW (of which solar stations comprise 300 MW; floating PV power plants, 0.1 MW; wind 
stations, 10 MW; and small hydroelectric power plants, 329.45 MW) (Kabar, 2022b).
• 
43 companies on 28 February 2022, which received 61 certificates for renewable energy entities, for a total planned 
capacity of 1 059.3 MW (of which solar stations compose 298 MW; wind stations, 50 MW; geothermal stations, 
300  MW;  and  small  hydropower  plants,  411.3  MW).  These  companies  will  be  included  in  the  state  register  of 
renewable energy entities.
Renewable  energy  auctions/tenders  were  identified  by  the  World  Bank  (2017c)  as  an  alternative  to  the  FIT-based 
approach for the deployment of small hydropower in the Kyrgyz Republic. It was suggested that the incentive mechanism 
can be based on the size of projects, for example, (1) tenders/auctions for larger projects; (2) registration/approval based 
on screening criteria for medium-sized projects and (3) a simplified regime for micro-hydropower plants.
In  June  2017,  the  GKPEN  officially  conducted  a  tender  for  the  construction  of  14  small  hydropower  plants  from 
3 to 20 MW. The tender was open to both national and foreign companies interested in investing in small hydropower, 
whereas  the  GKPEN  assumed  responsibility  for  facilitating  the  obtaining  of  the  necessary  permits  and  licences, 
including land permits. The land for the project was to be allocated by the state, and the land was to remain under 
state ownership.
 
As a result of the tender, GKPEN selected winners for 11 small hydropower projects. However, the official announcement 
of the winners was followed by a request from members of parliament that the government annul the results of the 
tender (Asanov, 2017; Energy Charter, 2018). The projects have not been implemented. 
While  distributed  renewables  that  produce  electricity  are  supported  by  the  Law  on  Renewable  Energy,  the  current 
tariff regime of the Kyrgyz Republic means that distributed renewables will struggle to compete financially with cheap 
electricity  from  the  national  grid  (or  cheap  diesel-based  power  generators)  at  the  retail  level.  The  introduction  of 
29
net metering with the current tariff regime is unlikely to generate significant interest. The introduction of wheeling 
regulations, coupled with easy licensing for self-consumption, can allow large users to use renewables to complement 
power from the national grid (which could be less reliable).
Moreover, the current energy legislation does not allow for the sale of electricity at unregulated rates to household 
consumers. In regions with unreliable power, this prohibition stops private institutions from setting up mini-grids to 
supply power to consumers. 
The Cabinet of Ministers is reviewing all legislation, including for the energy sector. Therefore, the above-mentioned 
laws  and  regulations  could  undergo  major  changes.  As  a  part  of  this  effort,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  has  formulated 
a  draft  Renewable  Energy  Law,  which  is  expected  to  abolish  the  quotas,  allow  the  sale  of  renewable  electricity  to 
customers at unregulated prices, increase the term of FITs up to 15 years and include statutes governing thermal energy 
and gas fuel, along with renewable electricity production. As of July 2022, the Law was approved by the President of 
the Kyrgyz Republic.
3.4  A strong rationale for renewables
This section analyses numerous factors that promise to boost the adoption of renewable energy technologies such as 
solar PV, wind, bioenergy and small hydropower. 
Rising domestic demand and fuel imports
Energy consumption in the country has been growing rapidly. About half of this demand is met with imported fossil fuels, 
which poses a substantial and growing economic burden, with implications for energy security. Final energy consumption 
increased by 54% between 2010 and 2019, to reach 3.5 mtoe (Figure 2.1). Electricity consumption, meanwhile, increased by 
about 75%, reaching 12.4 TWh (Figure 2.4). Residential electricity demand, the main driver behind consumption growth, 
increased by 152% after 2010 to account for two-thirds of electricity consumption in 2019. As living standards continue 
to improve and other sectors of the economy also pick up, growth in energy consumption is expected to continue. If the 
country does not invest in more sustainable energy sources the dependence on coal and oil is likely to increase, leading 
to more pollution from the burning of coal and transport fuels, and more imports of oil products.
The  Kyrgyz  Republic’s  energy  consumption  outstrips  local  production,  leading  to  expensive  energy  imports.  This 
makes the transition towards clean fuels a key imperative for the country. The Kyrgyz Republic exploits local reserves 
of coal and some oil and gas, but most fossil fuels are imported. In fact, more than half of its energy demand is met 
through oil and gas imports. More than 90% of oil products (primarily diesel and motor gasoline) and natural gas are 
also imported (IEA, 2020a). 
Net energy imports increased from 0.94 mtoe in 2000 to around 1.56 mtoe in 2019 (Figure 3.3). This increase was 
driven by rising net imports of oil products (mainly diesel and gasoline), which increased four-fold from just 0.3 mtoe 
to 1.1 mtoe in 2019. Net imports of crude oil also increased, as did domestic refining capacity. Net imports of coal have 
declined in recent years as the utilisation of local reserves increased. While local coal may reduce import dependence, 
it results in harmful impacts on air quality, health and the climate.

The imports and exports of electricity fluctuate in response to seasonal weather conditions and domestic demand. 
From 2014 to 2016, the country was a net electricity importer due to rising electricity demand and declining flow in 
rivers (Figure 3.4). In 2017 and 2018, the Kyrgyz Republic was again a net electricity exporter due to high water levels 
in reservoirs. As electricity demand continues to increase, and production remains unchanged, exports are expected 
to decline (SAEPF, 2020).

As energy consumption continues to rise, reliance on imported fossil fuels will increase. Dependence on imports of fossil 
fuels can be an energy security issue and is a significant burden on government budgets. Furthermore, dependence 
on  imported  fossil  fuels  could  also  make  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  more  vulnerable  to  volatility  in  the  international  and 
regional fuel markets. Renewable energy solutions can help cater to the domestic demand for electricity and heating, 
thus helping cut down the import bill. 
Deteriorating infrastructure
The assets and infrastructure of the Kyrgyz Republic’s energy and power sector are old and not well maintained (see 
Sections 2.2 and 2.3 for details). The deterioration of the infrastructure coupled with the financial crisis of the energy 
system, at some point, will eventually lead either to a significant decrease in the quality of produced energy or an 
increase in energy prices, both of which will increase demand for independent energy production and support the 
development of renewable energy.
Old  and  undermaintained  assets  and  infrastructure  undermine  reliability  and  supply  quality.  The  issue  of  reliability 
becomes more pressing in the winter season, as the demand for heating grows and the winter generation capacity 
cannot keep up (World Bank, 2017b).
The power system (and the Kyrgyz Republic’s energy system in general) needs significant investments to maintain 
ageing equipment or develop the capacity required to meet growing demand. Such investments are unlikely under 
current conditions since the system is losing money and is kept afloat through significant support from the government 
budget. Tariffs that do not reflect generation costs have significant financial ramifications and are at the heart of the 
financial issues faced by the power and energy sector (World Bank, 2017b).
Reducing local air pollution
The Kyrgyz Republic is among the European and Central Asian countries most affected by diseases linked to indoor air 
pollution (Balabanyan et al., 2015; World Bank, 2020). Thermal power plants, coal-fired heating units, emissions from 
road vehicles and the construction and mining industries are some of the key sources of air pollution. 
The burning of coal for heating and power generation is one of the main reasons for local air pollution, especially during 
the  colder,  winter  months.  Household  heating  with  coal  also  leads  to  indoor  and  outdoor  air  pollution  resulting  in 
significant health problems. The transport sector is a key contributor to air pollution throughout the year. In the winter 
season, traffic often slows down or comes to a halt on the icy roads. Drivers often do not turn off engines because they 
need heat. Their idling engines add to the already polluted atmosphere. New high-rise buildings in cities like Bishkek 
act as barriers to the flow of wind, which would normally carry these pollutants out of the city.
31
Renewable  energy  technologies  coupled  with  energy  efficiency  could  help  replace  fossil  fuels  (especially  coal) 
in  heating  and  power  generation,  thus  reducing  air  pollution.  Vehicular  emissions  can  be  reduced  through  greater 
adoption of public transport and the uptake of electric vehicles, which are powered by an electric grid with high shares 
of renewables. 
Climate change mitigation and adaptation
The Kyrgyz Republic has identified the water, energy, agriculture and infrastructure sectors as the most vulnerable to 
climate change. Projections indicate that the country could experience temperature rises significantly above the global 
average, reaching 5.3°C by 2090 under the highest emission pathways. Climate change could lead to impacts such as 
heat stress, increased arid land cover, erratic water flows and drying watersheds – all with significant implications for 
the country’s population, especially the poorest and marginalised groups (World Bank Group and ADB, 2021). 
Decision makers in the country understand the importance of addressing the challenge and are making every effort 
to ensure that these initiatives are successful. Despite low emission levels, the Kyrgyz Republic remains committed to 
addressing the global challenge of climate change.
The latest available national estimates (see Section 2.5 for details) show that GHG emissions in 2017 (excluding LUCF) 
were mainly from the energy sector (59%), followed by agriculture (32%), industrial processes (5%) and waste (4%). 
The transport and the electricity/heating sectors are included in the energy sector and account for 11% and 9% of total 
GHG emissions, respectively (OECD, 2019; WRI, 2020). A greater role of renewable energy and energy efficiency could 
help  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  the  country’s  energy  sector.  Renewables  can  also  contribute  to  adaptation  by 
providing reliable, affordable and modern energy services. Well-designed hydropower projects could be coupled with 
watershed restoration efforts leading to more climate-resilient water systems. 
As the decision makers of the Kyrgyz Republic move towards a clean energy transition signified by a more ambitious 
NDC,  they  can  make  a  strong  case  for  securing  a  sizable  share  of  climate  finance  to  support  renewable  energy 
deployments.  In  this  context,  the  government  could  also  approach  multilateral  financing  institutions  and  other 
intermediary development financing institutions created to channel public funds from developed countries to climate-
relevant projects in developing countries (IRENA, 2016; IRENA and CPI, 2020). 
Declining renewable energy costs
The  increasing  competitiveness  of  renewable  energy  technology  prices  further  strengthens  the  case  for  the 
uptake  of  non-hydro  renewables.  Falling  prices  are  especially  evident  for  solar  PV  and  wind.  The  global  weighted 
average  levelised  cost  of  energy  (LCOE)  for  utility-scale  solar  PV  fell  by  85%  between  2010  and  2020  to  reach 
0.057 USD/kWh. Meanwhile, the weighted average levelised cost of onshore wind energy decreased by around 56% 
over the same period to reach 0.039 USD/kWh (IRENA, 2021a). Recent supply chain constraints and commodity price 
increases are likely to result in increased costs for projects commissioned over the next two years, but to what extent 
these  will  be  offset  by  technology  improvements  and  cost  savings  elsewhere  is  not  yet  clear.  What  is  clear  is  that 
despite the potential  increase in renewable equipment costs,  the competitiveness of renewable power has actually 
improved, given the roughly five-fold increase in gas and coal prices over the past year.9
Hydropower also remains a very competitive option, where undeveloped economic resources exist, although lead times 
are longer than for solar and wind projects. The global weighted average LCOE of newly commissioned hydropower 
projects in 2020 was around 0.044 USD/kWh (around 18% higher than a decade ago). The increase in average LCOE 
is due to a range of factors but is likely to have been predominantly driven by a shift towards the exploitation of sites 
with more challenging civil engineering conditions. Still, hydropower is competitive with fossil-fuel-based generation. 
It was estimated that nine-tenths of all hydropower capacity commissioned in 2020 was producing power for less than 
the cheapest new fossil-fuel-fired projects (IRENA, 2021a). 
The  decreasing  renewable  energy  costs  are  facilitated  through  a  conducive  financing  environment  and  innovative 
financing schemes. As the competitiveness of renewable power continues to improve, the case for greater integration 
of renewables in the Kyrgyz Republic’s energy sector becomes stronger.

Abundant renewable energy resources
The country has significant renewable energy potential for technologies such as solar PV, wind, bioenergy and hydropower. 
As shown in Section 3.1, the preliminary findings of IRENA’s resource assessment study reveal that vast areas in the Kyrgyz 
Republic are suitable for utility-scale solar and wind power. Considering the overall technical potential, solar and wind 
resources can be successfully used to address part of the future energy demands of the country. 
The assessment combines renewable resource data with technical (electrical grid network, elevation and slope), and 
socio-environmental (protected areas, land features and population growth) criteria to determine suitable zones. It 
reveals that solar PV zones are located in the southern part of the Osh region along the river Kyzyl-Suu (Figure 3.1).
Wind zones are clustered in the southern region of Osh along the border with Tajikistan, the northern and southern 
regions in Naryn and the southern region of Issyk-Kul. Other sparse clusters are found in western Batken and southern 
Chuy (Figure 3.2). 
Short construction periods of solar and wind energy
The challenge of the Kyrgyz Republic’s rising energy demand needs to be met with investments in sustainable and 
clean technologies. Renewable energy technologies such as solar PV, wind and small hydropower tend to be modular 
and can be constructed in a very short time. Large solar PV projects (around 100 MW) can be completed in less than 
one year and construction times of six months have been reported for 50 MW wind parks. 
In  contrast,  large  hydropower  projects  tend  to  require  longer  construction  times  and  can  be  susceptible  to  delays 
and cost overruns. According to Sovacool, Gilbert and Nugent (2014), more than two-thirds of hydropower projects 
suffer from cost and time overruns, whereas less than 10% of solar and wind energy projects suffer from a similar fate. 
Renewable energy technologies such as solar PV and wind can provide a quick way of fulfilling rising domestic demand 
sustainably. 
Seasonal variation in hydroelectricity generation
Hydropower generation in the Kyrgyz Republic is influenced by several factors such as the state of river flows, the 
demand for electricity (especially in winter) and the demand for water for irrigation (especially in the irrigation season, 
i.e. summer). Seasonal weather patterns and weather extremes can adversely affect the supply of hydropower. Rainfall 
in the Kyrgyz Republic tends to decline in the winter months (Figure 3.5), which, coupled with reduced meltwater from 
glaciers, decreases river flows. Low river flows combine with high electricity demand for heating in winters leading to 
imports of electricity from neighbouring Kazakhstan (around 5 KGS/kWh or 5.9 USDc/kWh) and Tajikistan (around 
1-1.8 KGS/kWh or 1.2-2.1 USDc/kWh).

Several  renewable  energy  technologies  such  as  solar  PV,  wind,  hydropower  and  bioenergy  have  diverse  daily  and 
seasonal  generation  profiles.  This  allows  them  to  complement  one  another  in  a  diversified  system.  In  the  winter 
season, wind, for instance, can potentially complement hydropower. An energy system that includes a balanced mix of 
renewables can therefore be more resilient to seasonal variations.
Environmental impacts of hydropower
Hydropower projects should be developed and operated sustainably according to international best practices. As with 
any other large infrastructure project, large hydropower plants can lead to several negative environmental and social 
impacts during their construction and operation. These may include habitat destruction, population displacement, loss 
of forest, disturbance to wildlife, damage to water bodies such as streams and ponds, stress on water resources, heavy 
dust pollution and equipment noise pollution. 
Environmental impact assessments of several Kyrgyz hydropower projects report that environmental benefits outweigh 
impacts. The construction of Kambarata-1, for instance, has had a mainly beneficial impact in the Syr Darya river basin, 
improving the management of the Central Asian water-energy-food nexus. It can provide the Kyrgyz Republic with 
electricity during winters, and allow the Toktogul reservoir to store water during the winter, thereby reducing the risk 
of flooding in the lower reaches of the river and providing sufficient water for irrigation of the downstream countries 
in spring and summer (Tazabek, 2014). Some studies (e.g. World Bank, 1995) have cautioned that new hydropower 
projects may create environmental problems such as loss of farmland, resettlement, downstream loss of nutrients due 
to deposition of silt and impacts on fauna and flora. Natural disasters such as earthquakes and/or landslides could 
create  hazards  for  downstream  populations  as  the  existing  Toktogul  dam  and  the  planned  Kambarata  project  are 
located near a major fault in an active seismic area.
A shift towards small hydropower projects can help avoid some of the impacts linked with large projects. Run-of-river 
hydropower installations can sidestep several impacts associated with reservoirs. However, deployment should still aim 
to minimise environmental implications for land use, water flow and ecosystems. Operation and maintenance (O&M) of 
small hydropower projects can help improve their long-term sustainability, while ensuring that they continue to meet 
the demand for clean and reliable electricity. 
3.5  Issues faced in the deployment of renewables
As technology costs continue to decline and the challenges of climate change, air pollution and rising demand intensify, 
the case for greater adoption of renewables is growing stronger. That said, wide-scale deployment of renewables in the 
Kyrgyz Republic has been held back by several issues discussed in Section 3.4:
• 
The lack of a level playing field hinders renewable energy deployment at the retail level. Average power and heat 
tariffs are well below the levels needed to recover costs (Sections 2.2 and 2.3). 
•  Renewable  energy  targets  have  not  been  effective  as  they  are  not  enforced  by  law,  nor  backed  by  concrete 
policies. Responsible entities are not identified. Given the significant renewable energy resources, targets are not 
ambitious. Moreover, there are no clear targets for heating and transport (Section 3.3).
• 
So far, renewable energy policies remain limited to the electrical power sector. Policies such as mandates, fiscal 
and financial incentives and demonstration projects could encourage renewable heating (Section 3.3).
• 
Feed-in  tariffs  have  not  been  successful  in  attracting  investments.  The  current  level  of  3.27  KGS/kWh 
(USD 0.39/kWh)10 (i.e. 1.3 x 2.52 KGS/kWh – the highest consumer tariff) is too low. The institutional responsibilities 
are still not clear, quotas remain undefined. While certificates of registration as renewable energy producer have 
been awarded to over 70 companies, they have not been offered FITs (Section 3.3).
•  Auctions/tenders  have  not  been  successful  in  the  past.  While  winners  were  selected,  projects  have  not  been 
implemented due to due to various disagreements (Section 3.3). 
•  Distributed generation policies such as net metering and wheeling are not in place. Even if they were enacted/
implemented,  the  tariff  regime  is  not  conducive.  The  sale  of  electricity  at  a  rate  exceeding  2.52  KGS/kWh 
(USD 0.3/kWh) is hindered (Section 3.3).
• 
Permitting  procedures  require  further  clarification.  Location  of  renewable  energy  plants  is  permitted  on  some 
categories and types of land, with some categories requiring transformation to other categories of land, which is 
difficult.
•  Renewable energy capacity building is needed for both public and private stakeholders. Lack of adequate skills 
and know-how is hindering all stages of renewable energy deployment starting from policy making and going all 
the way to project construction and operation.

4.  RECOMMENDATIONS
A  smooth  transition  towards  a  sustainable  energy  system  that  addresses  the  various  energy  sector  challenges  by 
utilising the extensive renewable energy resources in the Kyrgyz Republic requires a conducive policy and regulatory 
environment that is well designed and implemented. This section presents a set of short- to medium-term recommended 
actions to address key challenges and support the country in moving towards a diversified and climate-friendly energy 
system. These recommendations and actions focus on creating a more conducive environment for renewable energy 
investments and project development.
4.1  Legal and regulatory reform
Scaling up the deployment of non-hydropower renewables in the Kyrgyz Republic requires an extensive reform of the 
policy and regulatory framework. A shift towards overarching policy frameworks, complemented by strong institutions, 
laws and regulations is vital in catalysing change in the energy sector status quo. A substantive reform of energy pricing 
structures and streamlining of regulatory procedures for renewable energy deployment can help create a favourable 
regulatory environment for renewables. 
The Kyrgyz Republic has one of the lowest electricity tariffs in the world. Tariffs for heat and electricity are well below 
cost-recovery levels (Energy Charter, 2018; Rosenthal, Gassner and Hankinson, 2017). As discussed in Section 3.4, this 
contributes to the inefficient use of energy and severe underspending on maintenance and new investments, while 
making renewables uncompetitive in comparison with easily and universally available cheaper grid energy. Concerns 
about poverty and affordability have meant that planned tariff reforms have not been implemented (Holzhacker and 
Skakova, 2019).
Renewable energy deployment in the Kyrgyz Republic has also been held back in the past by the lack of a streamlined 
process for bringing the projects online. Despite the presence of an approved FIT (see Action 3), projects were often 
held back for several reasons including a lack of clear institutional responsibilities governing the implementation and 
operation phases. The lack of comprehensive legislation governing land allocation had also been a key hindrance to the 
development of renewable energy sources. 
Action 1: Create a level playing field with energy tariff reforms
Well-designed  tariff  reforms  in  the  energy  sector  can  help  generate  revenue  for  investments  in  clean  and  modern 
infrastructure. They can also help lower the barrier to market entry for distributed renewable energy technologies such 
as small-scale solar PV and solar water heating. Appropriate retail tariffs can stimulate the emergence of alternative 
suppliers of electricity and heat supported by regulations encouraging net metering and wheeling. 
Political instability, an incomprehensive energy sector structure and lack of energy sector management transparency 
have resulted in a loss of trust and extremely low awareness of the population about the energy sector crisis. Over 
65% of respondents to household surveys said that electricity tariffs are too high and should be reduced (World Bank, 
2017a). To be sustainable, tariff reforms need to be designed in a way to minimise the economic impact on low-income 
and marginalised parts of society. Moreover, reforms should be coupled with awareness campaigns that provide more 
clarity about subsidies and the financial condition of the energy sector to help reduce the social and political opposition 
to increasing tariffs.
Countries  such  as  India,  Indonesia,  Morocco,  Pakistan  and  Zimbabwe  are  using  tariff  reforms  to  generate  funds  to 
make their energy sectors more sustainable while creating a level playing field for renewables. In Pakistan, retail tariffs 
have been increased gradually to improve the financial viability of the power sector. The higher tariffs have fuelled 
the growth of the domestic solar industry, which installed around 60 MW of net-metered residential and commercial 
rooftops in the 2019-2020 financial year (The News, 2020). 
Current status: The government has recently (2021) indicated that an increase in tariffs is needed to help address the 
financial issues faced by the energy sector (Eurasianet, 2021). The tariffs for non-residential customers were increased 
by  12.5%;  however,  the  tariffs  for  residential  customers  have  been  left  unchanged,  and  were  even  lowered  for  low-
income  families  due  to  the  high  political  sensitivity  of  the  issue  (SARFEC,  2021).  It  is  expected  that  the  tariffs  will 
be  raised  each  year  by  a  percentage  to  account  for  inflation  in  accordance  with  the  medium-term  tariff  policy  for 
electricity and heat for 2021-2025, accepted in October 2021 (GoK, 2021).
35
Action 2: Streamline the procedure for bringing renewable energy projects online
Permitting requirements and procedures should be streamlined under an overarching renewable energy law to provide 
a clear direction for deployment. The overarching law should be implemented through concrete secondary regulations 
that  clearly  articulate  the  process  and  identify  responsible  government  entities  to  facilitate  the  renewable  energy 
sector. The stability of the governance structure and well-defined responsibilities of each involved government body 
can increase investor confidence, reduce barriers to entry and lead to more efficient project deployment. 
The overarching principles for the design of the procedures should focus on simplicity, transparency and the flexibility to 
adapt to evolving market and regulatory conditions. As a starting point, land for renewable energy project development 
could be allocated by the government in zones with adequate accessibility to infrastructure, such as the electricity 
grid, water and roads. The amendments and additions to the legislation on the “provision of land plots”, accepted in 
July 2021 could help ease the process of land allocation for renewable energy projects. Further amendments to the 
Land Code, Water Code and the secondary legislation governing the provision of land plots are needed to enable the 
building of renewable energy plants on additional categories of land.
Furthermore,  a  one-stop-shop  system  for  renewable  energy  projects  could  be  set  up  to  streamline  the  permitting 
process  and  enable  better  coordination  of  internal  administrative  processes.  This  system  should  be  equipped  with 
the necessary decision-making abilities to enable the different stages of project development. Publishing procedures 
online, with clear guidance on the necessary steps including the documentation, timelines and the relevant government 
institutions could give much-needed transparency to developers.
Current status: The procedures for renewable energy project development are outlined in Regulation No. 525 (October 
2020). At the moment, the energy sector permitting processes are under revision as part of a wider reform of the 
sector’s governance structure.
4.2  Policy support mechanisms
The current policy support framework for renewables has not been successful in encouraging private sector participation. 
Strengthening the confidence of the private sector to invest in renewables would require the implementation of well-
designed support mechanisms that are attuned to specific national and local contexts. While long-term stability of 
policies is the key, policies must continuously adapt to changing market conditions to promote cost-competitiveness. 
There is a need to identify support mechanisms that would facilitate the transition towards a functioning renewable 
energy market. FITs are instrumental in the initial development of a national market for renewables. However, as the 
market matures, auctions, especially for large-scale installations, could help procure renewables at more competitive 
prices through price discovery. Furthermore, support mechanisms should also address the decarbonisation of the end 
uses, with a special focus on heating and transport. 
The GoK has introduced several policy support mechanisms such as FITs, tenders and end-use sector-specific policies 
with limited success. FIT schemes have not yet been deployed due to factors such as unclear institutional responsibilities, 
low tariffs and concerns about the long-term certainty of FITs. So far, tenders have not led to project implementation. 
While winners were selected, projects have not been completed due to various disagreements. Finally, the transport and 
heating sectors are very important from the perspective of energy consumption and energy-sector-related emissions. 
Coal, natural gas and oil are heavily used for district heating and stand-alone heating systems leading to significant 
emissions11 and local air pollution (IEA, 2020b). Simultaneously, the demand for diesel and gasoline has been increasing 
as more vehicles are added to the transport fleet. Cities such as Bishkek and Osh are suffering from local air pollution, 
which can be partly attributed to transport emissions. Policy support for the introduction of renewables and energy 
efficiency in the heating and transport sectors offers a promising opportunity to reduce air pollution and mitigate GHG 
emissions, with significant co-benefits.
11  While  actual  emissions  are  not  known,  energy  production  (power  and  heat)  accounted  for  around  24%  of  total  energy-related 
emissions in 2010 (SAEPF, 2016). Since most of the electricity comes from hydropower, heating likely accounts for the bulk of the 
energy production emissions. 
 
 
36
Action 3: Improve the feed-in tariffs
The FIT scheme should be revised and improved based on factors such as changing market conditions, competitive 
renewable energy costs and clearer resource assessments. The selection of an appropriate tariff is an extensive process 
that  should  be  led  by  the  government  with  active  and  diverse  representation  from  all  stakeholders  (government 
institutions, private sector, academia and development partners). Any reform of FITs needs to be supported by a clear 
demarcation of institutional responsibilities. Moreover, FITs, just like any other policy mechanism, need to be supported 
by a conducive policy, regulatory and institutional landscape to ensure rapid uptake of renewables.
FITs (and feed-in premiums, FIPs) have been adopted by more than 80 countries around the world. Globally, some 
of the leading solar PV installation markets around the world such as China (49 GW), Viet Nam (11 GW) and Japan 
(5.4 GW) have achieved their levels of deployment in great part due to their FITs (IRENA, IEA and REN21, 2018). As their 
sectors matured, and with their growing need for a policy scheme that better reflects the falling technology costs, most 
of these countries are using auctions, at least for their large-size projects.
The main challenge of a FIT relates to setting the right tariff or premium level, and adjusting it as needed. FITs that are 
too high can lead to windfall profits, strain the government budget and possibly lead to high consumer tariffs and the 
development of surplus capacity, which may need to be curtailed. Countries have addressed these issues using several 
approaches. France, Germany and the United Kingdom, for instance, used degression mechanisms that lower the FITs 
as the level of deployment increases and costs decline (IRENA, 2014). China combines FITs with regional quotas to limit 
solar PV deployment to target levels (Ye, Rodrigues and Lin, 2017). 
While  many  countries  are  moving  towards  auctions  (Action  4)  to  curb  deployment  costs,  some  are  choosing  to 
implement both. For example, Germany, Italy and Malaysia have simultaneously used auctions for large-scale projects 
and FITs/FIPs for smaller projects (IRENA, IEA and REN21 2018).
Finally, it should be noted that tariff setting alone may not be the only determining factor and a more comprehensive 
reform of the policy, regulatory and institutional landscape might be in order. The current FIT regime provides a FIT 
of 3.27 KGS/kWh (i.e. using a coefficient of 1.3 times the highest consumer tariff) (3.86 USDc/kWh) for all electricity, 
produced by renewable plants. This FIT is deemed too low by sector stakeholders. However, it should be noted that the 
coefficient for solar plants used to be as high as 6 up until 2017.12
Current status: The FITs and their implementation mechanism are under review by the MOEI. In late 2021 and early 
2022, 63 companies were registered as renewable energy producers, marking their intention to develop over 1 700 MW 
renewable capacity across solar, wind and small hydro. The new Renewable Energy Law, adopted in July 2022, offers 
a FIT with coefficient of 1.3 times the highest consumer tariff. It is not clear if the FIT will be offered to all stakeholders 
who have already registered as renewable energy producers.
Action 4: Implement auctions for large capacities
Renewable energy auctions need to be designed in a way that attracts investors and encourages competition, while 
also  ensuring  that  the  projects  are  delivered.  Auctions  can  be  used  to  attract  investment  for  relatively  large-scale 
projects in all technologies including hydropower, solar and wind. IRENA’s report “Renewable Energy Auctions: A Guide 
to Design” offers an overview of auction design options and their resulting policy trade-offs (IRENA, 2015). 
While it is important to have a developed renewable energy market that can ensure the required level of competition, 
it should be noted that several countries with nascent renewable energy markets are also using auctions to attract 
investments. Countries such as Madagascar, Senegal, Togo, Zambia and neighbouring Uzbekistan are using the World 
Bank’s Scaling Solar Program, which is a package of technical support, document templates, pre-approved financing, 
insurance products and guarantees targeted towards large-scale solar project development facilitated through auctions 
and private financing (or from the International Finance Corporation). Uzbekistan awarded a 100 MW plant in the Navoi 
region to the United Arab Emirates’ Masdar through auctions for 27 USD/MWh. The plant was commissioned in 2021 
(Ellichipuram, 2021; IRENA, 2019). Elsewhere in the region, Kazakhstan has used auctions to award more than 1 GW of 
renewable energy projects including 600 MW of wind, 350 MW of solar PV and around 100 MW of small hydro. The 
success of renewable energy auctions in countries with relatively new renewable energy markets demonstrates that the 
design of the auctions and overarching regulatory landscape can be very important factors. 
Current status: There are no officially confirmed plans in place to conduct any renewable energy auctions in the near 
future. Stakeholders have suggested that the EEU integration of the energy market in 2025 could be an opportune time 
for the introduction of auctions.
It should also be noted that wind and solar were much more expensive at that point in time. 
12 
37
Action 5: Enact policies to decarbonise end-use sectors (heating and transport)
The  decarbonisation  of  the  heating  sector  requires  a  multifaceted  approach,  which  includes  renewables-based 
electrification,  use  of  renewable  heating  (solar  thermal,  biomass,  geothermal)  and  investments  in  efficiency  and 
infrastructure including for district heating (IRENA, IEA and REN21, 2020). According to the 1.5°C Scenario in IRENA’s 
World Energy Transitions Outlook, electrification will supply more than half of global energy demand, including for 
heating and cooling. As such, the electrification of heating and cooling will play an important role in the decarbonisation 
of the energy sector. 
Heat pumps are becoming popular globally and incentives such as tax exemptions and rebates can be considered to 
promote them in the Kyrgyz Republic. China, for instance, offers a 10% rebate, approximately, on the purchase of air 
source heat pumps. Powered by the Kyrgyz hydroelectricity-based grid, heat pumps present a practical solution for 
increasing the share of renewable energy in heating end uses. Financial and fiscal incentives can be important near-
term mechanisms to encourage the switch to solar water heaters in buildings. These incentives may include a range of 
grants, low-interest loans and tax incentives.
The electrification of heating requirements needs to be complemented by the strengthening of current generation and 
distribution capabilities. Due to shortages of water and related low flow to large hydropower dams, household use of 
electricity for heating has been restricted in the past several years. 
Moreover, the authorities should continue to develop and pilot innovative solutions (e.g. solar-assisted district heating, 
heat meters) to increase efficiency and reduce fuel consumption. Lessons learnt from pilot projects should be used to 
implement extensive decarbonisation projects in the sector.
In the transport sector, more efficient public transport, electric vehicles and support for alternative modes (e.g. cycling 
and walking infrastructure) can help. In the long term, the introduction of electric vehicles can be significant in reducing 
local pollution and GHG emissions. This, and the electrification of end-use sectors in general, needs to be coupled with 
investments in the infrastructure needed for power generation, transmission and distribution.
Public procurement of electric vehicles, supported by investments in  charging infrastructure, and  related  expertise, 
can  help  stimulate  their  roll-out  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  by  making  them  more  visible  in  the  public  space.  Buses, 
government-owned vehicles and taxis are attractive early targets on the road towards e-mobility. While the global 
electric  bus  market  continues  to  be  dominated  by  large  economies  like  China,  India  and  the  United  States,  other 
governments  in  the  developing  world  are  also  working  to  add  them  to  their  public  transportation  fleets  –  often  in 
collaboration  with  international  development  partners.  The  city  of  Santiago,  Chile,  is  home  to  the  largest  fleet  of 
electric buses outside China (776 buses). Chile’s federal government has set a goal of electrifying the country’s entire 
bus fleet by 2040. Similarly, Bogotá (Colombia) and Mexico City (Mexico) increased their electric bus fleet with the 
acquisition of 406 buses and 193 trolleybuses, respectively, in 2020 (Bnamericas, 2021). 
The penetration of electric vehicles in private transport demands a broader set of policies, including financial incentives 
to facilitate their acquisition and cut their usage costs. In the short term, greater adoption of public transport offers 
the most effective solution. 
The decarbonisation of end-use sectors can be complemented through measures to encourage renewable generation 
by  consumers.  The  government  could  use  incentive  schemes  to  encourage  individual  consumers  and  mini-grids 
to  provide  low-cost  renewable  generation  to  the  grid  (and  to  other  consumers).  The  introduction  of  net  metering, 
wheeling and other distributed generation policies can help unlock the small-scale market segment. 
Current status: The Kyrgyz Republic had a zero customs duty on the import of electric vehicles for several years. The 
government is also planning to introduce tax and customs incentives on vehicles with hybrid engines (SAEPF, 2020). 
The new Tax Code was introduced on 18 January 2022 and the new incentives are not yet clear. As of now, there are no 
government initiatives to develop charging stations.

4.3  Long-term energy planning
The Kyrgyz energy sector needs long-term vision and planning that is cognisant of domestic and international trends 
and aims to ensure an affordable, sustainable, secure and reliable supply of energy to meet the country’s development 
requirements.
A better assessment of certain renewable energy resources can help pave the way for renewable energy deployment 
in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Given  the  country’s  extensive  experience  in  large  hydropower,  the  potential  for  hydro  has 
been analysed in the past; however,  more needs to be done to account for the planning challenges posed by erratic 
hydrological patterns due to climate change. For solar and wind resources, there is a lack of comprehensive economic 
potential analysis and zoning. 
A comprehensive plan for the development of the energy sector to address the challenges of rising demand, ageing 
infrastructure and increasing climate impacts is yet to be developed. Electricity and energy consumption in the Kyrgyz 
Republic has been increasing rapidly. The ageing energy infrastructure requires significant investments to meet growing 
demand. The country’s production from hydropower exhibits seasonal and annual variability, which significantly affects 
power reliability. Kyrgyz energy sector trends must be seen against the backdrop of the long-term impacts of climate 
change and an evolving global market in which renewable technology costs have been declining rapidly. Successful 
national energy sector planning demands a thorough analysis that incorporates all these dynamic factors. 
Energy  planning  can  contribute  to  the  process  of  setting  comprehensive  and  ambitious  renewable  energy  targets. 
The existing targets are not specific and not ambitious enough to capitalise on the rich renewable energy resources 
of  the  country  or  to  account  for  the  rapidly  increasing  energy  demand.  As  existing  generation  capacities  cannot 
cope with growing demand, the choice would be to either import more electricity - which is limited by the technical 
capacities of the power lines connecting the Kyrgyz Republic with Kazakhstan and other neighbouring countries or 
support the development of local renewables, facilitating local energy sector and economic growth. Renewable energy 
technologies such as solar PV, wind and bioenergy tend to be modular and can be deployed rapidly, which makes them 
ideal  candidates  for  meeting  rising  demand,  while  contributing  to  the  diversification  of  energy  sources,  enhancing 
energy security and climate resilience. 
Action 6: Improve renewable energy resource mapping
As  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  aims  to  achieve  a  more  diversified  power  generation  mix,  zoning  for  solar  PV  and  wind 
generation projects should be prioritised. 
Renewable  energy  zones  can  be  defined  as  areas  with  high-quality  resource  potential  where  deployment  is  viable 
from  a  technical,  economic  and  environmental  standpoint.  These  areas  satisfy  various  criteria  such  as  proximity  to 
grid infrastructure, load centres, road networks and other generation projects. The zoning exercise can assist future 
planning, target setting and policy development.
The characteristics of each zone, such as annual generation and estimated LCOE, can help policy makers in planning. 
Moreover, an enhanced mapping exercise can also be a very useful basis for project developers, with the potential for 
reducing development and transactional costs. 
IRENA’s potential suitability analysis (Section 3.1), which identifies suitable zones for solar PV and wind, can serve as 
an  important  initial  step  towards  a  complete  zoning  assessment.  The  assessment  identifies  three  suitable  solar  PV 
zones clustered in the southern region of Osh along the river Kyzyl-Suu (Annex Table A2). It also found 77 wind zones 
clustered in the southern region of Osh along the border with Tajikistan, the northern and southern regions in Naryn 
and the southern region of Issyk-Kul. Other sparse clusters were found in western Batken and southern Chuy (Annex 
Table A3). Follow-up studies could build on IRENA’s zoning exercise by performing a detailed analysis of the technical 
and economic potential within the identified solar and wind zones. As a next step, these analyses can be strengthened 
by ground-based measurements. 
Current status: There is an active initiative focusing on renewable energy resource assessment, mapping and zoning, 
supported by USAID. 
39
Action 7: Develop long-term energy scenarios 
A detailed long-term planning exercise should be undertaken for energy demand and supply in all sectors to identify 
the  optimal  energy  mix  and  inform  policy  decisions  accordingly.  Given  the  strong  share  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic’s 
non-electrified end-use sectors in energy consumption and emissions, a deeper focus on sectors such as heating and 
transport is needed, which should fully assess the potential for electrification, and energy efficiency and renewable 
energy penetration. Given the extensive linkages between the power and water sector of the country, the dynamics 
of seasonal and climatic patterns in water requirement for energy and food production should be a cornerstone of 
any  national  energy  sector  planning  exercise.  The  long-term  integrated  energy  plans  can  be  essential  for  efficient 
investment in infrastructure which avoids duplications and stranded assets.
It should be noted that the demand for electricity (and energy in general) is relatively hard to predict. Scenario analyses 
that explore a host of different energy sector futures with their underlying assumptions can be used to develop a better 
understanding of the consequences of energy sector decisions. These scenarios can provide useful insights about the 
sector and can serve as essential inputs for setting targets and enacting policies for transitioning towards sustainability. 
Accurate  and  timely  data  and  information  are  crucial  for  the  formulation  and  revision  of  energy  plans.  Therefore, 
energy sector planning needs to be complemented by reforms in the collection and reporting of energy statistics. 
IRENA’s  report,  Planning  for  the  Renewable  Future:  Long-Term  Modelling  and  Tools  to  Expand  Variable  Renewable 
Power in Emerging Economies, provides insight for planning greater renewable energy integration in the power sector. 
The report emphasises the need to adequately address variability, uncertainty and the location-dependency of variable 
renewable  energy  in  long-term  generation  expansion  models,  and  to  integrate  stronger  feedback  loops  between 
planning stages (IRENA, 2017).
The formulation of energy sector plans and scenarios can be an essential step in developing investment trajectories 
for  the  sector.  Once  the  funding  requirements  for  the  energy  scenario  are  determined,  the  government  (and  other 
stakeholders)  could  plan  for  accessing  different  funding  sources.  The  funding  could  come  from  various  revenue 
sources,  including  tariff  reforms,  taxes  (e.g.  on  transport  fuels),  as  well  as  contributions  from  donor  organisations. 
Additionally, the government could also target international climate funds and climate finance institutions such as the 
Global Environment Facility, the Climate Investment Funds and the Green Climate Fund (IRENA, 2016; IRENA and CPI, 
2020). The Climate Investment Platform, a joint initiative by IRENA, UNDP and SE4All, which is helping developers in 
preparing bankable projects and matchmaking with financing partners could provide another avenue for accessing 
renewable energy finance. 
Current status: The Kyrgyz Republic has finalised the development of the National Expert Sustainable Development 
Goals Tool for Energy Planning (NEXSTEP) with the support of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission 
for Asia and the Pacific, which aims to help policy makers make informed policy decisions to achieve their Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) 7 and NDC targets by creating several energy sector development scenarios up to 2030. 
The scenarios will be used in the development of a national SDG 7 roadmap, which would be a good starting point to 
develop enabling policies to achieve SDG 7 and NDC targets. 
Action 8: Establish comprehensive and ambitious renewable energy targets
The  GoK  can  send  strong  signals  to  all  sector  stakeholders  by  establishing  renewable  energy  targets  that  are 
representative  of  the  country’s  strong  renewable  energy  potential,  declining  technology  costs,  rising  demand  for 
energy and socio-economic development goals. 
These  targets  should  have  a  direct  connection  to  national  high-level  priorities  and  be  backed  by  strong  political 
commitment and legislation. They must to be rooted in long-term energy plans and rigorous scenario analysis involving 
all generation technologies. They also need to be directly linked to the country’s NDC, long-term strategies and broader 
climate objectives. 
Furthermore, they should be defined at the level of the energy sector and disaggregated by sector (transport, heating, 
electricity, etc.). Within the electricity sector they could be divided by specific technologies (see examples in Table 
4.1). Stakeholder engagement during the design of the process could strengthen credibility and feasibility. The targets 
should be clearly defined and the responsible entities identified. Finally, targets need to be backed by specific policies 
and measures that would expedite renewable deployment in the country. IRENA is already contributing to this effort 
to help build capacity in the local public and private sectors, with dissemination activities focusing on target setting 
and auction design.
Current status: The Green Billion Plan, which aims to stimulate the production of a billion kWh from renewable energy 
technologies, has been discussed on and off for over a year by the government but has not yet been offered for open 
discussion.

4.4  Facilitate financing and de-risk investments
A large share of energy investments in the Kyrgyz Republic has been through foreign direct investment (FDI). The 
domestic banking sector does not have significant experience financing non-hydro renewables. Meanwhile, a lack of 
bankable renewable energy project proposals is a major deterrent to renewable energy financing in the sector. In this 
context, improved power purchase agreements (PPAs) and the greater adoption of public-private partnerships (PPPs) 
could de-risk investments and help leverage the financial and technical capabilities of the private sector. 
PPAs  have  a  high  degree  of  relevance  in  facilitating  renewable  energy  investments.  PPAs  are  very  important  to 
renewables, given that before investing in independent power producer (IPP) plants, private entities and lenders want 
to be sure that there is a secure market for the output of their production facilities. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the duration 
of a PPA for renewables is set to a maximum of 10 years, and current draft changes to the Law on Renewable Energy 
sets the PPA duration at 15 years. The contract parties are responsible for monitoring the PPA implementation. In the 
past, there have been some issues of non-payment to small hydropower plants by distribution companies.
PPPs are projects in the field of infrastructure development that introduce private sector funds, expertise and motivation 
into areas that are normally the responsibility of the government. Globally, PPP arrangements have become widespread 
in  the  field  of  renewable  energy.  They  have  been  used  in  developed  and  developing  countries  in  conjunction  with 
several policy mechanisms ranging from quotas in the United States to FITs and auctions in Europe and the rest of the 
world. In the region, the government of Uzbekistan recently entered a PPP arrangement with Masdar Clean Energy for 
the development of a competitively tendered 100 MW PV solar power plant.

Action 9: Adopt a standard power purchase agreement
The key design elements of current renewable energy PPAs should be reviewed in accordance with international best 
practices. Where possible, this effort should be complemented by a thorough review of contractual project document 
templates for renewables along with the development of standardised PPAs. 
In this context, the Open Solar Contracts initiative, jointly launched by IRENA and the Terrawatt Initiative, can be a 
very  useful  resource  for  contractual  templates  to  be  included  in  solar  power  procurement.  The  initiative’s  contract 
templates are the result of a rigorous collaboration involving key stakeholders at the intersection of the solar energy 
and legal sectors. The contracts are primarily designed for small- and medium-sized, on-grid solar PV projects and 
include agreement templates for power purchase, implementation, O&M agreement, supply, installation and finance 
term sheets (IRENA and TWI, 2019). 
Variable renewable energy technologies such as wind, solar and small hydropower have some distinct characteristics, 
which  need  to  be  accounted  for  in  their  PPAs.  These  characteristics  include  variability  (how  much  generation  and 
at  what  time),  uncertainty  (predictability  of  the  generation)  and  location  constraints  (co-ordination  between  grid 
and generation). These characteristics should be adequately accommodated through PPA design features governing 
supply and purchase commitments, curtailment clauses and requirements for dispatch procedures.
Price uncertainty and the fear of non-payment can have a significant influence on investment decisions and financing 
costs. This makes the role of PPAs even more important. These agreements need to be backed by strong legal regulation 
that helps improve the credibility of the sector, lowers capital costs and attracts investors and project developers.
Current  status:  The  government  is  in  the  process  of  approving  a  standard  PPA  for  specific  renewable  energy 
technologies.
Action 10: Introduce public-private partnerships 
To be successful, the introduction of PPPs in the Kyrgyz energy sector needs to be backed by strong political will, 
capable  institutions  and  conducive  legislation.  Fair  risk-sharing  criteria  must  be  established  that  support  profitable 
returns for the private sector. If the services are not delivered at the required level the private sector must be penalised. 
On the public side, there must be acceptance of the principle of whole-life costing, and an absolute commitment to 
the government’s long-term (15-30 year) payment for power generation. Overall, the responsibilities of all stakeholders 
should be clearly defined to ensure smooth operation and delivery of essential public services. 
Well-designed  PPPs  allow  for  several  advantages  such  as  on-time/budget  delivery;  optimal  risk  management; 
efficiencies from the integration of design, construction, financing and O&M; competition and greater participation; and 
accountability for the provision of renewable energy. By bringing in a more experienced private developer backed by 
a credible off-taker, PPPs can help de-risk investments and lower deployment costs. PPPs transfer several risks such as 
cost overruns (construction, O&M) and forecast errors (e.g. overestimation of resources) from the public to the private 
sector, thereby creating value for the government (UNECE, 2013).
Investors are increasingly becoming risk averse and before lending to IPPs, they expect that formalities such as planning 
consents,  grid  connection  offers,  PPAs  (Action  9)  and  construction  contracts  are  in  place.  Therefore,  governments 
should seek to facilitate the IPP in arranging these formalities. Moreover, the government should also ensure that the 
whole process is carried out transparently to develop credibility among developers and lenders. 
Current status: While no PPPs have been announced in the renewable energy sector, a memorandum of understanding 
has been signed between the Ministry of Energy and private companies such as Masdar and EcoEner to develop solar 
and hydropower projects (AKIpress, 2022; Skopljak, 2022).
4.5  Capacity development in the public and private sectors
For  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  to  achieve  ambitious  targets  for  renewables  and  energy  efficiency,  the  country  will  need 
concerted capacity-building efforts on several fronts. The Kyrgyz Republic’s renewable energy sector has historically 
focused on the deployment and maintenance of hydropower, which means that know-how and familiarity with other 
clean technologies (renewables and energy efficiency) are scarce in both the public and private sectors.
Lack of awareness of renewable energy is a key challenge in many government departments and ministries, which 
often end up blocking policy development and delaying approvals and funding for projects. Institutional stakeholders 
need to ensure adequate co-operation and co-ordination among themselves to respond promptly to the dynamics of 
the renewable energy sector.
42
The private sector could also benefit from extensive capacity building to help develop a capable renewable energy 
workforce  and  a  thriving  domestic  renewable  energy  value  chain.  Several  universities  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  offer 
education with a specialisation in renewable energies, including the Kyrgyz State Technical University, Kyrgyz-Russian 
Slavic  University  and  the  Kyrgyz-Uzbek  University.  Some  of  these  institutions  are  co-operating  with  international 
scientists  on  research  projects  focusing  on  different  areas  of  the  clean  energy  landscape.  That  said,  the  renewable 
energy market remains small, and it is not able to absorb the students graduating from universities.
Action 11: Enhance institutional capacities
The  technical  and  co-ordination  capabilities  of  public  and  private  sector  entities  require  improvement  to  facilitate 
renewable  energy  deployment.  Capacity  needs  assessment  studies  aimed  at  different  stakeholders,  such  as  public 
institutions, private sector, academia, the general public, etc., could be an important preliminary step in this direction.
Support from international donors and development banks could be sought to set up periodic capacity-building efforts 
in relevant government entities. Capacity building in the public power sector institutions, for instance, could focus on 
areas such as cost competitiveness of renewables, technical issues in the integration of variable renewables in the grid, 
management  of  a  system  with  substantial  shares  of  renewables  and  introduction  of  flexibility  mechanisms  such  as 
storage and demand-response. 
Capacity building in the public institutions involved in policy making can focus on areas such as the design of renewable 
energy targets, renewable energy auctions, design and implementation of FITs, net metering, etc. 
IRENA  is  already  contributing  to  this  effort  to  help  build  capacity  in  the  local  public  and  private  sectors  with 
dissemination activities that could potentially focus on target setting, auction design and resource assessments. In this 
context, a lot can be learned from the experiences of countries at different stages of deployment. In solar deployment, 
the  Kyrgyz  Republic  can  learn  from  the  experiences  of  a  wide  variety  of  countries  including  established  markets 
(e.g. China, India, etc.), as well as markets that are only now starting to make strides in the sector (e.g. Kazakhstan, 
Türkiye, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Zambia, etc.). 
Furthermore,  awareness  of  renewable  energy’s  benefits  and  competitiveness  can  also  encourage  adoption  among 
people in the private sector. 
Current status: Several projects are already striving to create awareness in the tourism and agricultural sectors. The 
SWITCH-Asia project, for instance, aims to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy in the community-based 
tourism sector in Central Asia, while the PERETO project is aimed at promoting energy security and sustainable growth 
by promoting sustainable production and consumption and energy and resource efficiency practices among small- and 
medium-sized enterprises in the tourism sector of the Kyrgyz Republic. 
Action 12: Educate and train a skilled workforce
Investment  in  the  education  and  training  of  workers  such  as  engineers,  technicians  and  other  skilled  personnel  is 
very important. Universities, vocational training institutes and schools all have a role to play. As such, the government 
authorities in charge of energy, training and education should collectively work towards the introduction of renewable 
energy training curricula. 
The creation of renewable-energy-related skills is best seen in the context of an ongoing global transition that has 
transformational impacts on the energy sector workforce. Fossil-fuel-based jobs are already facing several challenges 
due  to  variations  and  fluctuations  in  demand.  IRENA’s  analysis  foresees  that  by  2050,  42  million  people  could  be 
working globally in the renewable energy sector with an additional 21 million people employed in energy efficiency 
and almost 15 million in the power grid and energy flexibility. Undoubtedly, the skill requirements for jobs related to 
renewables and energy efficiency are set to increase. The Kyrgyz Republic can benefit from this trend by investing in a 
capable renewable energy workforce. 
The development of a skilled workforce needs to go hand in hand with investments and policy support for the relevant 
industries.  Industrial  upgrade  programmes  can  help  strengthen  the  capabilities  of  local  firms.  These  programmes 
should aim to enhance the technological capabilities of domestic industries by enabling them to derive value from 
renewable energy investments and to facilitate closer linkages with business partners. Joint ventures and tax breaks 
can also be used to strengthen local capabilities. Some countries, e.g. India, Morocco and South Africa, have also used 
domestic content requirements to strengthen local industry. 
Current status: While universities in the Kyrgyz Republic are offering courses in topics related to renewable energy, the 
lack of opportunities in the sector is a major problem for youth with specialisation in renewables.

ANNEX 1. Solar PV and wind  
potential in the Kyrgyz Republic
This report presents the results of an assessment conducted by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to 
identify promising land areas in the Kyrgyz Republic for utility-scale solar and wind power development. 
Zoning assessments are generally conducted to support transmission planning. Specifically, they allow:
• 
• 
analysis of the quality of the solar and wind resources across the country (theoretical potential);
identification of most suitable areas for solar photovoltaic (PV) and onshore wind development by considering 
renewable resources alongside technical, financial and socio-environmental criteria;
• 
• 
• 
identification of potential sites for solar PV and onshore wind farms;
identification of suitable zones for grid integration; and
examination of opportunities for cost-effective solar PV and onshore wind development.
Approach
The suggested approach to conducting the zoning assessment is outlined below.
Data setting
The  required  input  data  to  conduct  the  zoning  assessment  for  solar  PV  and  onshore  wind  development  relate  to 
renewable resources, infrastructure, land and terrain features (Table A1). Such data are of great importance in mapping 
the suitability index and defining suitable zones for each technology. The annual solar and wind data – specifically the 
global horizontal irradiation or wind speed – is the most important dataset in evaluating the theoretical potential of an 
area for developing renewable energy projects (Figures A1 and A2). The required data also include infrastructure and 
socio-environmental datasets – on transmission lines, topography, protected areas, land use and population growth – 
which help in determining the technical potential.

Suitability assessment
The  suitability  assessment  is  a  multicriteria  decision  analysis  based  on  a  geographic  information  system  (GIS)  that 
establishes the technical potential13 of an area to host utility-scale renewable energy projects. These areas are assessed 
by combining renewable theoretical potential14 with technical (electrical grid network, slope), and socio-environmental 
(protected areas, land features and population growth) criteria, using a weighted linear combination approach. The 
output of this assessment is a suitability map for every square kilometre (km2) of land in the country (wherein highly 
suitable areas have high suitability index values) (Figures 3.1 and 3.2). The calculation of this map requires:
• 
specifying the lower bound (lowest score 0% for the least favourable area) and upper bound (highest score 100% 
for the most favourable area) values for each criterion;
• 
defining  hypothetical  weights  for  each  criterion  (0.38  resource,  0.33  grid  distance,  0.13  distance  to  the  road, 
0.11 population density, 0.05 slope);
• 
• 
scoring every kilometre of the considered criteria following the assumption and thresholds set;
aggregating  all  criteria  using  a  weighted  linear  combination  to  calculate  the  suitability  index  for  every  square 
kilometre; and
• 
excluding protected areas and land cover to refine suitable areas complying with national legislation.
Clustering assessment
A clustering technique has been used to create defined zones around the country to host utility-scale projects. The 
output of this clustering is a zone map showing prospective areas of sizes varying from 7 km2 to 10 km2 for solar and 
6 km2 to 215 km2 for wind (Figures 3.1 and 3.2, respectively). The extraction of this map requires various assumptions 
to define the resulting zones (Table A2). The steps completed are as follows:
• 
specifying the cut-off suitability values for solar PV (72.5%) and wind (83%) as well as the maximum concentration 
capacity (5 000 megawatts) and land discount factor (1%);
• 
• 
identifying adjacent areas with a suitability index higher than the cut-off value; and
grouping adjacent suitable cells into definitive clusters or prospective development zones.
Provisional results
Based on public datasets and reasonable assumptions, the provisional results obtained suggest the following: 
• 
•  Wind zones are clustered in the southern region of Osh along the border with Tajikistan, northern and southern 
regions  of  Naryn  and  the  southern  region  of  Issyk-Kul.  Other  sparse  clusters  are  found  in  western  Batken  and 
southern Chuy (Table A3).
Solar PV zones are clustered in the southern region of Osh along the river Kyzyl-Suu (Table A2).
