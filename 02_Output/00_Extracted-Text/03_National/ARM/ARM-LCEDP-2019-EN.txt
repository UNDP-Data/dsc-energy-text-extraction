ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY
DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020 - 2036
MARKET LIBERALIZATION AND 
ELECTRICITY TRADE 
PROGRAM
Yerevan, Armenia
November 19, 2019
OBJECTIVES
The Least Cost Energy Development Plan (LCEDP) for Armenia was realized using The 
Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) software developed by the International Energy 
Agency and used in more than 70 countries.
The LCEDP for Armenia covering the period up to 2036 allows us to 
examine scenarios and to analyze various pathways to: 
• Strengthen the energy security and independence of the country
• Bring a reliable supply of energy to meet all consumer needs at the lowest 
cost possible
• Realize energy efficiency and renewable energy potentials
• Assess the effectiveness of existing generation and consumption technologies 
available in the market

Main Assumptions for TIMES-Armenia (1 of 2)
➢GDP growth was set at 6.75% in 2018, 4.65% in 2020 and held 
constant after 2022 at 4.5% per year
➢Population has a small negative growth and will slightly decrease 
over the planning period, although residential demand for energy 
will still grow on average 1.7% per year.
➢The commercial sector is the main contributor to demand for 
useful energy, with average annual growth of over 4.4%
➢The agriculture and industrial sectors contribute less to the growth 
of demand for useful energy, with average annual growth rates of 
around 0.2% and 2.2%, respectively
➢The border gas price is assumed to increase, reaching the European 
prices level in 2027 (US$ 299/1000 m3) and growing at the same 
rate thereafter

Main Assumptions for TIMES-Armenia (2 of 2)
➢Electricity losses decline to a total of 8.2% for the transmission and 
distribution systems in 2028 and remain constant thereafter.

NEW GENERATION ENTRY TO THE SYSTEM
The fact that the full constrained amount of solar and wind capacity is selected by the model as part 
of the least cost solution for new generation under this (and all) scenario(s) underscores the 
importance to Armenia of ensuring a policy and institutional environment that supports realization 
of new VRES generation to the maximum extent practicable, not only to ensure the lowest cost 
generation but also to minimize reliance on other imported energy sources and to strengthen 
Armenia’s energy security and competitiveness.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS   (1/3)
• The LCEDP results emphasize the importance to Armenia of 
ensuring a policy and institutional environment to support 
realization of new VRES generation to the maximum extent 
practicable.
• This will not only ensure the lowest cost generation but also minimize 
reliance on other energy sources and strengthen Armenia’s energy 
security and competitiveness
• Evaluating higher levels of economic growth introduced no differences 
in new power plant capacities in level or by type required to cover 
electricity demand through 2036 compared to the baseline. 
• The only effect of higher income growth was in increased use of 
existing installed capacity of both VRES and gas-fired thermal power 
plants, with a concomitant increase in expenditures on natural gas fuel.
25
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS (2/3)
• Scenarios for life extension of the ANPP decrease total system cost 
and reduce GHG emissions and imports of natural gas for electricity 
generation, while they increase total investment costs for new 
generation capacity by around 12 - 15% compared to BASE-R. 
• Scenarios with new nuclear units to replace the ANPP from 2027 
increase total system cost and reduce GHG emissions and imports of 
natural gas for electricity generation, while they significantly increase
the required total investment costs for new power generation by 116 -
164%, compared to BASE-R.
• While life extension of the ANPP represents a least-cost 
policy choice for continuing to maintain nuclear capacity in 
Armenia’ energy mix, such life extensions must first and 
foremost always ensure that all measures required for the 
continued safe and reliable operation of this older plant are 
fulfilled.
26
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS (3/3)
• While low gas prices reduce total energy costs, the increased 
use of cheaper gas maintains and deepens Armenia’s 
dependence on imported energy. 
• Scenarios which imposed GHG emissions reduction targets to meet 
the level defined in Armenia’s NDC largely mirror the “new nuclear” 
scenarios, increasing total system cost and reducing in GHG emissions 
and imports of natural gas for electricity generation, while leading to 
even larger total investment costs for new power generation capacity 
than the nuclear scenarios.
• Policies that would promote increased deployment of electric 
vehicles and electricity for heating increase the utilization of 
expanded domestic VRES, reduce reliance on imported  gas and 
strengthen Armenia’s energy security.
