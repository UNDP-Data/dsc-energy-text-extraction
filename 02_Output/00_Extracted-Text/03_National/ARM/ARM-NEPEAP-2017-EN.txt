Why is Energy Efficiency Important for Armenia?
create conditions for economic growth while improving 
the country’s energy security. 
reduce the energy intensity of the national economic 
output, improve cost-effectiveness & competitiveness
maintain a safe, sustainable and affordable energy supply, 
while mitigating climate change
help meet increasing energy demand, capturing “lost 
opportunities” for saving energy in new construction
Improve the quality of life for the Armenian population, 
create jobs and help local economy 
Energy Efficiency can:
reduces utility bills for all consumer groups
reduces use of  limited natural resources and pressure on 
endangered forest resources
Under conditions of extreme energy import dependence, energy that Armenia’s citizens, businesses, 
and infrastructure do not use is the cheapest, cleanest, and most secure energy resource. 
Quantifying Energy Efficiency for Armenia’s Economy
Realizing full economic 
potential of energy saving, can 
rise Armenia’s domestic energy 
supply may rise by 50-70% 
(reduced energy imports)
Economic gain from energy 
saving equivalent to 5% of GNP, 
or 80% of state budget deficit
1m3 of imported natural gas costs 
twice more than investments to 
reduce 1m3 natural gas 
consumption
Building 1kW new capacity costs 
5 times more than saving 1kW 
energy on demand side

NEEAP Process Introduction
• NEEAPs in Southeast European Countries (West Balkans, Moldova, Ukraine, 
pending Georgia) 
• focus on documenting ongoing efforts, 
• identify cost-effective and/or low-cost/no-cost measures to promote energy efficiency, 
• under conditions of limited availability of funds from state budget, rely on IFI lending 
and private sector participation
• 1st National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP)
• developed in 2010 for 2010-2013, assessed for 2010-2014
• Set energy saving target for 3% by 2013; 
• 2nd NEEAP 
• Assesses the 1st NEEAP progress (2010-2014)
• Sets forth targets for the next 3-year period (2015-2017)
• Sets indicative targets for 2018 and 2020
• Outlines the allocation of institutional roles and monitoring duties
NEEAP also includes
The 2nd

1st NEEAP Analysis: Lessons learnt
EE credit lines for various borrower groups operating through banks on commercial terms – successful! 
• Due to the mixed reporting on lending, impossible to separate sectoral impacts
The lending for public building energy efficiency very successful!
Efficiency upgrades in transport sector successful both in public and private sectors
Energy Tariff increase has had a direct impact on curtailing consumption
• Not only through efficiency, but also through sacrificed comfort, hence utility affordability is an issue
Despite crisis, slow economic growth, lending and EE investments grew
Need aggressive policy reform to accelerate EE In other sectors, where progress has lagged
Achievements
Legislation, programming, strategic documents, planning, technical regulations 
for promoting energy saving and energy efficiency  
Significant expansion of RES utilization, including EE-integrated renewables
Combined heat & power development (Yerevan TPP, Hrazdan TPP 5th unit, Avan

Gaps for Energy efficiency 
The latest Government decree on mandatory compliance with EE requirements in state investment projects and residential construction
The lack of enforcement in

including enforcement 
procedures for 
Energy auditing regulations
Standards & Codes for all sectors
Labeling of appliances and buildings  
Energy performance in buildings
Technical regulations on building safety and energy performance, 
Associated legislative 
initiatives have been put 
forward, but adoption 
and/or enforcement lags 
Amendments to the Law on Urban Development, 
Law on Yerevan City Center
Amendments proposed to housing legislation, need a holistic policy reform
Failed enforcement of the voluntary provisions of the Law on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy 
No financial 
incentives for EE
Introduction of benchmarking through best available technologies also requires strong legal provisions coupled with incentives
Not all EE credit lines have financing terms adequate for energy efficiency borrowers
Not all sectors 
adequately covered by 
financiers
Some sectors have multiple credit lines serving (e.g. public buildings, households, corporate), multi-apartment building niche not covered by any
LFIs lack skills and knowledge to adequately partner with private sector for EE investment financing
ESCOs lack skills for bankable project preparation and negotiations with LFIs
Industrial enterprises lack knowledge and understanding of EE and its true costs & benefits 
Multi-apartment buildings’ capacities to serve as a lending partner for EE investments
Municipalities lack capacities in energy planning and project development
Central Government lack capacities in monitoring and reporting on EE Plans
Lack of capacities 
Lack of information dissemination about the opportunities and benefits of EE, RE, technical and  financing solutions, service & material vendors
Imperfect information and 
lack of awareness among 
all user groups
Lack of information on subsectoral energy consumption patterns, utilized technologies, energy saving potential 
Lack of MRV on the effectiveness of various policy, capacity-building, and financing efforts 
Ways to Eliminate Gaps and Move Forward…
• Amendment of the Law on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy
• Adoption/ enforcement of bylaws on energy auditing and EE in public procurement
• Development/ enforcement of EE standards, codes and labeling for all uses
Continued reform:
• Continued operation and expansion of R2E2 Fund operations
• Smooth integration of E5P grant co-financing for non-bankable projects
• Leveraging IFIs & LFIs resources to address underserved segments of EE financing market
EE funding:
New/improved housing 
legislation:
• Create favorable investment environment  in multi-apartment buildings
• Introduce private sector participation through private maintenance companies & ESCOs
• Revise tariffs to incentivize energy efficiency
• Low-income assistance for implementation of energy efficiency measures
Tariff reform:
EE-integrated 
renewables:
• Incentives for wider combined energy efficiency-integrated renewable energy  application
• Improvement of energy efficiency data collection and periodic energy balance calculation
• Development and provision of technical assistance in best available energy efficiency 
Information and 
outreach:
technologies for the industrial and agricultural sectors (e.g., greenhouses and aquaculture)
• Strengthen capacities among HOAs, SMEs, ESCOs, municipalities to plan and implement EE
• Strengthening the institutional capacity of the State to develop and implement EE policy.
• Create/assign capacities to oversee NEEAP implementation, conduct MRV

for years 2010-2012. The National Statistical Service, Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and INOGATE Technical 
Secretariat have signed a memorandum on "Cooperation in the field of statistics" including an action plan related to 
actions necessary  the energy balance. However, no regular procedure for routine preparation of energy balances for 
following years was put in place. 
The National Agency was not established, instead the R2E2 has been tasked with many of the functions that 
traditionally national agencies perform.

I.3 Financial Support for EE m
easures in all Sectors
Over $86 million has been committed to EE and EE-integrated renewable energy investment during 2010-2014 via 
various donors and IFIs, such as WB, IFC, GEF, EBRD, IFC, GGF, EIB, KfW, and UNDP. In addition, these donor and IFI 
funds have had a market transformation impact on the financial services sector. According to Econoler experts' 
estimations, the local financial institutions and universal credit organizations have also tapped into this market and 
financed EE & RE investments from own resources in addition to on-lending portfolio with the IFIs. By expert 
assessment, over $420 million has been invested by LFIs and UCOs in diverse loans, with average equity financing of 
17.5% which leverages approximately $89 million in equity participation. Overall, it can be concluded that 
approximately $595 million has been invested in EE and EE-integrated RE solutions during 2010-2014.

About 150 thousand TOE was saved in 2010-2015 
through EE lending, and more than 18.30 mln TOE would 
be saved in 2016-2020, due to the cumulative effect of 
savings from past investments. GGF is going to be e main 
player in this activity with its estimated share in total 
savings expected to be about 97.2%. This may potentially 
be due to the fact, that majority of IFIs has failed to 
provide reasonable forecast of lending plans beyond 
2015.

Amount of EE / RE Loans provided by LFIs, including International Financial Institutions’ (IFI) funds, increased from 
$68.74 mln in 2010 to $83.78mln in 2015, i.e. 2.71% per year, which is about 1.72 times less than the annual GDP 
growth rate. So, Armenia had about $340 mln unutilized EE investment potential in 2010-2015.
