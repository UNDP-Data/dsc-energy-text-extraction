EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
To assist the Government of Barbados with achieving its 
2030 vision of becoming 100% fossil fuel free (FFF) by 
2030, the Government of Barbados, with the Ministry of 
Energy and Water Resources (MEWR), commissioned 
the development of this implementation plan (IP) to 
supplement the Barbados National Energy Policy (BNEP). 
3.  Oil and Gas Supply; 
4.  Transport; and 
5.  Renewable Energy Supply and Storage. 
Working group seminars were held from November 
2018 to December 2018. During the Renewable Energy 
Stakeholders meeting, a survey was administered to 
identify critical factors relating to opportunities and 
threats to the implementation of the 100% FFF vision. 
35 interviews with persons from various organisations 
helped to flesh out specific activities for implementation 
to be carried out by those organisations. 
This IP identifies output-level measures 
that will accelerate full integration of 
renewable energy (RE) into Barbados’ 
energy mix. 
The first section of the document explains the 
methodology and approach undertaken to develop 
the IP. Following the methodology section, is a 
projection of Barbados’ target renewable energy mix 
in 2030, including calculations for target numbers, 
details on costs and benefits and spatial requirements 
for the renewable energy technologies necessary 
to achieve the 2030 vision. The IP also includes a 
detailed implementation toolkit, which includes an 
implementation strategy by year and thematic area 
listing the required activities to achieve the 100% FFF 
target by 2030, a results framework, a monitoring and 
evaluation framework, and potential management 
arrangements. Key limitations and assumptions of this IP 
are included toward the end of the document, followed 
by three appendices. Appendix A lists the activities to 
be implemented by various entities and stakeholders, 
Appendix B and C describe the risk register guidelines 
and threat rating. 
The working groups identified some concerns to be 
addressed in order to achieve the 100% FFF vision and 
proposed solutions to these concerns. Specifically, 
these concerns include resource identification and 
mobilisation, capacity building, communication and 
change management. For resource identification 
and mobilisation, the establishment of a Resource 
Coordination Team (RCT) will serve to identify 
sources of technical and financial resources and will be 
responsible for project concept and proposal writing 
and review and other related activities. This team 
will be cross-sectoral and comprise of experts from 
various Government Ministries. A detailed capacity 
assessment was listed as necessary during the initial 
stages of implementation in order to identify gaps in 
the various entities/organisations required to create an 
enabling environment for achieving the 2030 vision. The 
capacity assessment will focus on staffing, technology 
and training. For communication, the working groups 
identified the need for communication channels that 
facilitate constant dialogue across the working groups as 
necessary. This will include an online dialogue platform, 
quarterly stakeholders meetings with members of 
all working groups, allowing for updates on progress 
and inviting comments for consideration. Finally, a 
framework will be established to assist individuals and 
organisations in making the change to 100% FFF. The 
The IP approach reflected a multi-sectoral stakeholder 
process. The methodology consisted of 5 working 
groups separated by thematic area:
 
1.  Natural Environment and Climate Change;
2.  Electricity Supply, Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation;
 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR BARBADOS NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY  |  7
framework will focus on the principles of awareness, 
desire, knowledge, ability and reinforcement (ADKAR). 
Monitoring and evaluation of the IP will include a project 
inception workshop to determine roles, ownership, 
responsibilities, reporting, communication, decision-
making structures, staffing and other key factors and 
requirements for successful start of the project. Several 
reports and logs, along with an annual project review 
and annual review report, will assist in monitoring of 
implementation. A mid-term review and final evaluation 
will focus on delivery of project results. 
The IP includes energy targets for 2030 based on 
various estimates and assumptions. Over the next 5 
years, 2019 to 2023, 295 MW of renewable energy 
is one possible scenario could  be potentially be 
commissioned, consisting of a minimum of 160 MW of 
solar photovoltaics and a minimum of 120 MW of wind. 
This scenario also identifies 80 MW of energy storage. 
The scheduled implementation of technologies will 
result in 688 GWh of electricity from renewable energy 
sources in the first 5 years of implementation. The 
estimated cost of achieving 100% renewable energy by 
2030 is about $4 billion, while the estimated economic 
benefit from the sector on an annual basis is projected 
to average around $3.9 billion per year over the ten 
year implementation period, which can be attributed 
to a release of resources used to import fossil fuels. It 
was found that greater local investment might result 
in greater local benefits, whereas greater foreign 
investment means less benefits being retained locally. 
A detailed risk register included in the IP reflects the 
concerns expressed in the working group sessions, 
as well as from the individual interviews with key 
stakeholders. These threats to implementation will guide 
the Project Implementation Team accordingly along with 
relevant remedial actions aimed at minimising and/or 
avoiding the occurrence of identified threats. 
In terms of management of implementation, a Project 
Management Team (PMCT) and Project Task Force 
(PTF) will be established. The PMCT will support the 
delivery of the outputs. The responsibilities of the PMCT 
include day-to-day management and coordination of 
the project and its respective activities, e.g. Monitoring 
and Evaluation, Procurement, Administrative Support, 
Technical Support and Finance and Awareness and 
Communication within the IP. 
Spatial requirements for each of the renewable energy 
technologies vary by technology. The IP finds that 
solar photovoltaic facilities will need a minimum of 
317 acres while wind technology will need 50 acres. 
The estimated total spatial requirement for renewable 
energy generation facilities is 758 acres. Land 
requirements for biomass are based on requirements 
for feedstock. The IP estimates between 25 000 to 
28 000 acres necessary for biomass feedstock (sugar 
cane and king grass) and food. 
The PTF, or Project Board will consist of representatives 
from various Government Ministries, including MEWR, 
Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs and Investment, 
the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC), the 
Barbados Chamber of Commerce and a representative 
from a relevant Non-Governmental Organisation. Page 
48 of the IP includes a visual of the reporting structure 
for the various teams. 
The implementation toolkit in this IP consists of: 
a)  A list of Policy Measures;
b) 
c)  Results Frameworks;
d)  Monitoring and Evaluation Framework;
e)  Risk Analysis; and
f)  Project Management Arrangements. 
Implementation activities by year and thematic area;
It is important to note key assumptions and 
considerations related to the development of the 
IP. The first assumption is that supervision of this 
implementation plan will be done by the PMCT. 
Second, it is assumed that the thematic working 
groups outlined in the IP will continue to meet 
8  |  IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR BARBADOS NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY
and provide oversight to the activities and that 
other stakeholders will be integrated into the IP 
as necessary. It is also expected that stakeholders 
will formally take ownership of various activities 
and can therefore be considered responsible for 
particular activities. The fourth assumption is that 
public communication of developments regarding 
progress and milestone achievements will occur and 
fifth, a resource mobilisation team will be established 
to identify financial and technical resources for the 
activities outlined in this IP. 
Recognising these limitations, the IP is 
designed as a ‘working document’ with 
sufficient flexibility and adaptability to 
rapidly incorporate inputs at any given 
time, without compromising the overall 
quality of the outputs identified.
In terms of considerations/limitations, the first is that 
the narrow timeline for consultation in development of 
this IP resulted in the prioritisation of thematic areas 
based on input from a range of relevant documents. For 
this reason, some thematic areas are disproportionately 
represented. However, the IP will advance working 
group engagements to incorporate other critical 
sectors throughout the project cycle. Second, although 
the working group sessions were well attended and 
representative of the core drivers of the IP, input from 
other critical stakeholders will be needed to fully 
align activities to the existing operations of relevant 
institutions.

INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the IP is to identify the necessary activities 
that will accelerate the paradigm shift across various 
sectors, towards the realisation of full integration of 
renewable energy (RE) into the energy mix of Barbados. 
The IP therefore promotes functional cooperation primarily 
amongst government agencies, private sector entities 
and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in an effort 
to ensure the most relevant participatory framework 
throughout the identification process and submission of 
key activities in the 100% FFF initiative. 
safeguards. Awareness, Communication and Knowledge 
Management are also vital areas in which NGOs can 
assist. The overarching focus of NGOs will be on the 
alignment of the outputs and outcomes of the IP, relative 
to generally accepted standards and targets such as the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
In the area of developing renewable energy sources, 
Barbados must achieve ambitious targets that will 
contribute to an increase in the reliability of the energy 
supply, reduce negative impacts on the environment, 
economic growth and the development of jobs and 
employment. As a result, the Government of Barbados 
has embarked on an agenda of becoming 100% Fossil 
Fuel Free (FFF) by 2030, while taking into consideration 
a number of exogenous constraints beyond the 
parameters of its regulatory and developmental 
jurisdiction. Worth noting within these constraints are 
considerations for the availability and costs of various 
renewable energy (RE) technologies, both of which are 
driven by external aggregate factors of demand, supply 
and rate of technological advancement. In line with the 
2030 vision, the Government of Barbados, through 
the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources, has 
commissioned the development of this Implementation 
Plan (IP) to supplement the Barbados National Energy 
Policy (BNEP). 
To that extent, the IP recognises 
the importance of the government 
institutions in facilitating regulatory, 
legislative and other policy-related 
measures to streamline existing 
processes and effectively adapt to the 
changing local and international realities 
in the renewable energy sector.  
In order to address long-term sustainability throughout 
the transition, the private sector has to be afforded 
opportunities to maximise on the economic benefits 
aligned to various technologies and aspects of 
renewable energy (i.e. generation, distribution and 
storage). The role of the private sector therefore 
develops within a model of economic sustainability, that 
further enables the transfers of capital and technology 
necessary to ensure that Barbados is in touch with 
developments in the international RE sector. 
The activities in this IP have evolved from key provisions 
in the BNEP, such as the overarching vision, associated 
goals, objectives and policy measures. The IP advances 
the BNEP framework by identifying activities, risks and 
measurable results. These features collectively define 
the enabling environment in the short-term (first 5 
years) that would allow for the long-term realisation 
of becoming 100% FFF in Barbados, within the given 
resource and time constraints.
NGOs have a key role to play in the rollout and overall 
success of the IP. The NGOs will ensure that the 
activities are executed in a manner that encompasses 
various developmental considerations such as gender 
mainstreaming and environmental and engineering 
 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR BARBADOS NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY  |  11
•  Environmental and health benefits – The transition 
to RE will allow decreases in the overall levels of CO₂ 
and other greenhouse gas emissions in Barbados. 
This development will add value to the sustainability 
and/or restoration of many aspects of the natural 
environment and may reduce the incidence of some 
health related matters. 
During the development of the IP, support from key 
stakeholders in the public, provided the necessary 
platform for initial targeted inputs. These stakeholders, 
throughout the consultation process, highlighted many 
determining factors that were crucial for success in the 
100% FFF initiative. Key among these were: 
•  Government commitment to transitioning to RE – 
International Agenda – This endeavour of 100% FFF 
will signal that Barbados is establishing a serious and 
leading agenda not only regionally but also across 
the world, for other countries to observe and follow. 
• 
The Government of Barbados has established the 
transition to RE as an item high on its priority list 
and “Mission Critical” agenda. This therefore allows 
for minimal or no disruption in seeking cooperation 
with relevant government agencies.  
•  Tourism – The international agenda will result in 
Barbados being able to exploit and capitalise on 
another niche markets in the international tourism 
sector (e.g. Eco-Tourism). This in turn may positively 
affect foreign exchange revenue generation. 
•  Exposure to external market volatility - 
Unpredictability of developments in external energy 
markets and subsequent impacts on fossil fuel 
prices. 
•  Prevailing economic conditions (foreign exchange) 
– A significant portion (approximately 5%) of 
Barbados revenue is utilised for importing fossil 
fuels. This consumption presents an inverse 
relationship to the overall levels of foreign exchange 
reserves. 
To assist in the overall management 
of critical activities, the IP has 
developed and incorporated an 
Implementation Toolkit, which is 
intended to add value to the pace of 
implementation and the quality of 
intended outputs.
•  Geographical location – At 13.1939° N, 59.5432° 
W, Barbados can take advantage of ‘prime’ levels 
(exposure and duration) of RE such as solar. There 
are also some geographical advantages with respect 
to other types of RE; i.e. wind and wave energy.

METHODOLOGY & APPROACH
The IP reflects a multi-sectoral engagement process, consistent with the approach used to create the Barbados National 
Energy Policy (2017-2030). The IP recognised the need for critical input from a wide variety of key stakeholders, as well 
as the various tools utilised in the collection, analysis and incorporation of information that validated the activities and 
timelines proposed. These tools were:Working Groups - Stakeholders categorised into five (5) main working groups, 
along with three (3) crosscutting thematic areas as depicted in Figure 1. Working Group seminars were held as follows:

interviews.
Survey – A survey was conducted during the Renewable 
Energy Stakeholders meeting, hosted by the Ministry of 
Energy and Water Resources on Wednesday, November 
28 at the Sir Lloyd Erskine Sandiford Center. On the 
survey, respondents identified critical factors relating 
to opportunities and threats to the implementation of 
the 100% FFF vision. 12 respondents at the meeting also 
Interviews – 35 individual interviews were conducted with 
various organisations, identified as responsible parties,

STRATEGY
In order to achieve the intended results, outcomes and 
goal of the IP, it is essential to take preparatory steps 
that immediately address some concerns identified by 
stakeholders. These concerns are:
The RCT will comprise a cross section of relevant entities 
that regularly interact with funding agencies in the area of 
Energy, Environment, Climate Change and Disaster Risk 
Reduction. These may include, but not be limited to:
Resource Identification and Mobilisation
Resourcing the many activities within the IP will be 
a decisive factor in its overall success, as preliminary 
estimates suggest that BBD $4 billion will be required 
to achieve the 2030 vision. It is therefore important to 
develop a structured and adaptable framework to map 
all possible sources of technical and financial resources 
available to the executing agencies involved. This exercise 
will be undertaken by a Resource Coordination Team that 
will assist in:
•  The Ministry of Energy and Water Resources
•  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade
•  The Ministry of Environment and National 
Beautification
•  The Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs and 
Investment
•  A representation of local entities participating in 
1.  RE Project Concept and Proposal Writing and 
the financial sector and international development 
space

2.  Providing implementation support where applicable 
The RCT will meet at least every quarter.
 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR BARBADOS NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY  |  17
Capacity Building
Implementation efforts will initially focus on identifying 
capacity gaps in key organisations that have essential roles 
in creating an enabling environment for the IP to progress 
at a reasonable rate. These institutions include Town and 
Country Planning Department, Fair Trading Commission, 
Barbados Renewable Energy Association, Environmental 
Protection Department, Barbados National Oil Company 
Ltd., Barbados National Standards Institute, Government 
Electrical Engineering Department, Department of 
Energy, Sanitation Services Authority and the Ministry 
of Finance, Economic Affairs and Investment. A detailed 
capacity assessment will focus on addressing the following 
questions:
Communication
The creation and maintenance of forums for constant 
dialogue is essential for success of the IP. Communication 
channels, which utilise the guidance and technical expertise 
of the established working groups, will allow for timely 
adaptation to any relevant developments in both the 
external and internal stakeholder environment.  A quarterly 
stakeholder’s consultation, consisting of all members of 
established working groups, will communicate project 
progress and invite comments for further consideration. 
Communication on implementation progress, aided by the 
creation of a reliable online digital platform, will highlight 
the status of implementation of various activities, targets 
(outputs) and justifications for any shortfalls. This platform, 
although dedicated primarily to communicating progress, 
adds to the overall of accountability of responsible parties.
•  Staffing – Do these organisations possess the 
quantity and quality skillset needed to facilitate their 
roles in delivering results outlined in the IP? 
Change Management
As the evolution to 100% FFF implicates a rapid 
transition in a relatively short period, it is important to 
adopt an approach that supports individuals, teams and 
organisations in making the change. Therefore, a series 
of change management engagements to promote an 
ADKAR framework, where ADKAR reflects the principles 
of awareness, desire, knowledge, ability and reinforcement 
is needed to capitalise on sustainable support from 
all stakeholders. These are all critical areas to change 
management.
•  Technology – Do these organisations possess the 
requisite hardware and software apparatus, which 
will allow for uninterrupted service provision to 
various activities outlined in the IP? 
•  Training – What are key capacity building 
engagements that will allow these organisations 
reach or surpass an acceptable standard of delivery 
and continuously be aware of modern developments 
in their field of operations, in alignment to the 
activities outlined in the IP?
To advance this effort, ongoing initiatives such as the Public 
Sector Smart Energy Programme (PSSEP) will be utilised. 
PSSEP will be undertaking a cross-sectorial capacity 
assessment, which will help to identify critical gaps in the 
readiness and adaptability of public and private sector 
institutions to the paradigm shift. In addition, PSSEP will 
action the findings and address some of the capacity gaps 
directly, through the provision of training, equipment and 
other related and relevant resources.
It is important to adopt an approach 
that supports individuals, teams and 
organisations in making the change.

ENERGY TARGETS
The Government of Barbados stated its commitment to 
transition the island to 100% renewable energy by 2030. In 
order to achieve this target by the stated period, there needs 
to be a clear energy mix that can be implemented at feasible 
investment and operation costs. The planned energy mix 
will also include technologies that can operate under the 
following constraints over the planning period of 2030:
•  The target demand for energy
•  The spatial requirements for generation
•  Emission of CO2 for energy produced  
and consumed
•  Capital and operation expenditure to

the reduction of the carbon emissions via fuel switching 
to natural gas. Additionally, it is foreseeable that the airline 
industry will also most likely continue to use aviation fuel 
over the planning horizon (i.e. 10 years). 
It is important to note that the energy mix will also be 
constrained by technology. Hence, the fishing industry 
and the cruise industry will be impacted, as many of these 
vessels utilise diesel and heavy fuel oil. The challenge 
here is that over the planning horizon and the initial 
implementation period the technology may most likely not 
With regards to energy savings, it has been acknowledged 
that emphasis must be placed on a strategic investment in 
renewable infrastructure, in order to capitalise on annual 
energy savings of $400 – $800 million1.

22  |  IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR BARBADOS NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY
During the first five years of the implementation period of 
2019 to 2023, 295 MW of renewable energy and 80 MW 
of energy storage is forecasted to be commissioned. Solar 
photovoltaics will require a minimum of 160 MW to be 
installed while a minimum of 120 MW of wind will need to  
be installed to achieve the target of 100% renewable energy 
by 2030. 
mix is impacted by the technical limits of the electrical 
grid, the environment impact assessment, construction 
and installation time needed. Additionally, the regulatory 
and permitting processes will have to be accelerated by a 
significant margin. It must be noted that Waste-to-Energy is 
not scheduled within the first 5 years of implementation, as 
the planning and construction time required would place this 
technology in year 6 of the schedule.
The 295 MW in the first 5 years will represent 46% of 
the total capacity energy mix. The baseload technologies 
which accounts for 15 MW of the total capacity, given their 
nature, will require more planning and construction time and 
consequently are scheduled to be commissioned in year 5 
of the implementation period. The scheduling of the energy 
The successful implementation of the technologies 
identified in Table 2A will result in 688 GWh of electricity 
being produced from renewable energy sources as is 
observed in Table 3A.

Table 3A - Schedule Electricity Production (Gwh) From Renewable Energy Over the Next 5 Years 
The investment required by the renewable energy sector to 
advance the agenda of 100% renewable energy by the year 
2030 is estimated to be about $4 billion. The majority of the 
resources expected to be expended are $875 million and $270 
million, in years 4 and 5 respectively as the larger projects are 
scheduled to be completed in these two periods (See Table 
4A). Of course, the rate of investment will be impacted by the 
enabling environment that is required to be established within 
the renewable sector. For instance, a clear and stable price is 
the foundation on which the sector will rest.
energy, as Barbados will no longer be incurring an 
economic loss of 70 cents on every dollar to consume 
fossil fuel. Additionally, the support to the renewable 
energy sector in terms of financial services, installation, 
construction, plant operation, and professional services 
are other sources of economic activity anticipated to 
emerge.  However, this is dependent on the level of local 
investment that will become involved in the sector. There 
will also be an opportunity for Barbadians to become 
exporters of energy once the cost of batteries become 
economically feasible, as energy will becomes more 
portable. Hence, with greater local investment will come 
greater benefits being retained in Barbados, while a heavy 
infiltration of foreign investment will result in an inverse 
outcome; less benefit being retained locally.
The economic benefit that is anticipated to accrue from the 
sector on an annual basis is projected to average around  
$3.9 billion per year over the ten (10) year implementation 
period.  This benefit is expected to be derived from the 
release of resources that would have been used on imported

Table 4A - Schedule of Investment In Renewable Over the Next 5 Years ($M)
The spatial requirements for electricity generation vary 
between the different technologies. For example, the 
spatial footprint for ground mounted solar photovoltaics 
can range between 2 to 4 acres per megawatt depending 
on the configuration of the system. In the case of roof 
mounted system, the availability of space will be impacted 
by how much of the roof is south facing, shaded and size 
of the roof. Solar photovoltaic has a large spatial footprint 
and consequently there are not too many complimentary 
economic activities that can operate once a solar farm is 
installed. Wind technology has a lower spatial footprint for 
electricity generation relative to solar photovoltaics and can 
co-exist with other economic activities such as agriculture. 
of space (See Table 5A). It is estimated that the sector will 
require approximately a minimum of 367 acres of space 
during the first five (5) years of implementation. The total 
spatial requirement for renewable energy is estimated to be 
758 acres of space by 2030. Baseload technologies’ spatial 
requirements for generation can be considered low, relative 
to the requirement for wind and solar technologies. The 
bulk of the land requirement for biomass (sugar cane and 
king grass) relates to the feedstock. The amount of land 
that will be used to produce the feedstock is estimated to 
be between 25 000 to 28 000 acres. In the case of bio-
methane, farm waste, manure, food waste, and gasses are 
expected to be the principle feedstocks. The production of 
feedstock for energy can be rotated with food crops in very 
much the cycle as that of sugar cane. Hence, biomass offers 
significant synergies with agriculture and can be seen as an 
opportunity for income stabilisation.
During the first five years of implementation, solar 
photovoltaic generation facilities will need a minimum of 
317 acres of space while wind technology will need 50 acres

Monitoring and Evaluation Framework
•  Based on the initial risk analysis submitted (see Risk 
Analysis), a risk log shall be developed and regularly 
updated by reviewing the external environment that 
may affect implementation. 
In accordance with the accepted project management 
standards, policies and procedures within the Executing 
Agency (MEWR), implementation will be monitored 
through the following:
•  Based on the above information, to be recorded in 
Inception Workshop
The project will be officially launched no later than 
three months after the project start with a Project 
Inception Workshop for those with assigned roles and 
responsibilities in the project's organisational structure,  
and where appropriate/feasible, technical policy advisors 
as well as other stakeholders.
a location suitable to the PTF, a Project Progress 
Reports (PPR) shall be submitted by the Project 
Coordinator to the Programme Steering Committee 
through Project Assurance (MEWR), using a 
standard report format agreed to by the PTF 
•  A project Lesson-learned log shall be activated and 
regularly updated to ensure on-going learning and 
adaptation within the MEWR, and to facilitate the 
preparation of the Lessons-learned Report at the 
end of the project. 
The Inception Workshop will address a number of key 
issues including: (a) Assist all key stakeholders to fully 
understand and take ownership of the project.  (b) 
Detail the roles, support services and complementary 
responsibilities of MEWR staff vis à vis the project team. 
(c) Discuss the roles, functions, and responsibilities 
within the project’s decision-making structures, including 
reporting and communication lines, and conflict resolution 
mechanisms. (d) The Terms of Reference (TOR) for 
project staff is reviewed as needed. (e) Provide a detailed 
overview of reporting, M&E requirements. The M&E work 
plan and budget should be agreed and scheduled. (f) 
Discuss financial reporting procedures and obligations, 
and arrangements for annual audit. (g) Plan and 
schedule Project Task Force (PTF) meetings. Roles and 
responsibilities of all project organisation structures should 
be clarified and meetings planned. The first PTF meeting 
should be held within the first 2 months following the 
inception workshop.
•  A Monitoring Schedule Plan shall be developed to 
track key management actions/events.
Annually
•  Annual Review Report. An Annual Review Report 
shall be prepared by the Project Coordinator and 
shared with the Project Board. 
•  Annual Project Review. Based on the above report, 
an annual project review shall be conducted during 
the fourth quarter of the year or soon after, to 
assess the performance of the project and appraise 
the Annual Work Plan (AWP) for the following year. 
In the last year, this review will be a final assessment. 
This review, commissioned by the Project Board, 
may involve other stakeholders as required. It shall 
focus on the extent to which progress is made 
towards outputs, and that these remain aligned to 
appropriate outcomes.
Within the annual implementation cycle 
•  On a quarterly basis, a quality assessment shall 
record progress towards the completion of key 
milestones, based on the criteria and methods 
captured in an approved Quality Assurance 
Assessment Form. 
Project Evaluation
Due to the complexity of this project and the myriad of 
inter-related components being implemented by multiple 
responsible parties, mid-term and final evaluations are 
proposed. These are to occur during the fourth quarter of 
2024 and 2029 respectively. 
•  An Issue Log shall be created and updated by 
the Project Coordinator to facilitate tracking and 
resolution of potential problems and/or requests  
for changes. 
42  |  IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR BARBADOS NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY
The Mid-Term Review will determine progress being 
made toward the achievement of outcomes and will 
identify course correction if needed.  It will focus on 
the effectiveness, efficiency and timeliness of project 
implementation; will highlight issues requiring decisions 
and actions; and will present initial lessons learned about 
project design, implementation and management. Findings 
of this review will be incorporated as recommendations 
for enhanced implementation during the final half of the 
project’s term. The organisation and terms of reference 
of the mid-term review will be decided after consultation 
between the parties to the IP. The Terms of Reference 
(TOR) for this Mid-term review will be prepared by the 
MEWR based on guidance from the Public Implementation 
Unit (PIU) in the Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs and 
Investment. This independent expert will be recruited at 
least six months prior to the planned commencement of 
the mid-term review.  The management response and the 
review will be uploaded to a location as designated by the 
MEWR and accessible to the PSC.
The final evaluation will focus on the delivery of the 
project’s results as initially planned (and as corrected after 
the mid-term review, if any such correction took place). 
The final evaluation will look at impact and sustainability of 
results, including the contribution to capacity development 
and the achievement of global environmental benefits/
goals. The TOR for this evaluation will be prepared by the 
MEWR based on guidance from the PIU.
The Final Evaluation should provide recommendations for 
follow-up activities and requires management responses.

Management Arrangements
•  Other Project Board Member 
The MEWR will establish a Project Team, referred to 
as the Project Management Team (PMCT), which will 
be entrusted to support the MEWR to deliver on the 
outputs outlined in this IP. The PMCT will assist with 
the coordination of multi-stakeholder deliverables and 
monitor the progression of the various established 
enabling activities. The MEWR will provide financial 
oversight and fiduciary and safeguard handling capacity.
The Project Steering Committee will liaise with the 
Barbados Cabinet Sub-Committee on Energy for its 
members to participate actively during meetings and to 
propose agenda items to be discussed.
The PTF will provide guidance, in accordance with 
overarching policy direction, to the PMCT on specific 
components project as outlined in this IP document and 
in alignment with the policy measures of the BNEP. The 
PTF is responsible for making, on a consensus basis, 
management decisions for the project, in particular 
when guidance is required by the PMCT, including 
recommendation for approval of IP revisions. IP reviews 
by this group are made at designated decision points 
(including at least annually) during the running of the IP, or 
as necessary when raised by the PMCT.
Project Management Team
The PMCT will be responsible for the day-to-day 
management and coordination of the project and 
its respective activities. It will be responsible for the 
general management actions, such as the preparation of 
consolidated annual work plans and technical and financial 
reports to be presented to the Project Task Force.   
The PMCT will provide services of Project Management, 
Monitoring and Evaluation, Procurement, Administrative 
Support, Technical Support and Finance and Awareness 
and Communication within the IP. The organisation of 
the PMCT will reflect a focus on these services, as well 
as coordination of activities across responsible parties 
and thematic areas identified. The PMCT of the MEWR-
overseen project will report to the Project Steering 
Committee. The PMCT will be recruited by the MEWR and 
will be given the authority to manage the implementation 
components on a daily basis as per the boundaries 
established by this IP.  
The responsibilities of the PTF shall include, but not be 
limited to: 
1.  Review, approve and amend this IP, including the

The EEL can therefore create many avenues for small, 
medium and large-scale economic activity across 
Barbados, thereby favourably affecting employment and 
foreign exchange generation. Tailoring the instrument to 
accommodate an approach of ‘one licence per property’ 
also adds value to the prospects of entrepreneurship and 
the ability to generate new small businesses in the RE 
sector, with the creation of a new and broader base of 
clients. The feasibility of collateralising the instrument 
will be a focus of the study, with a view to exploring 
opportunities where economically disenfranchised and 
vulnerable persons with property holding rights can utilise 
their EELs to offset a variety of financial burdens such 
as the inability to service some forms of debt (e.g. taxes 
owed and loans).
One critical measure of success in the IP will be how 
well it promotes the involvement, development and 
empowerment of residents at the community level. 
Traditionally, measuring this indicator implicated a heavy 
reliance on outputs of awareness and communication. 
However, this IP embarks on an ambitious proposition to 
create a more formal, robust and sustainable engagement 
with all communities across Barbados, by establishing a 
Renewable Energy Licensing Regime (RELR), which when 
launched, would automatically monetize all property 
interests in Barbados, with respect to the prospects of 
renewable energy generation at their respective locations.
The study identified in Activity 93, under Renewable 
Energy Supply and Storage will serve as a major 
catalyst for this engagement. The study aims to validate 
and define the framework for establishing an RE 
market of tradable instruments (e.g. licences) for all 
residential, commercial and agricultural properties. The 
establishment of the RELR will enable small (8000sq ft. 
or less), medium (8001 sq. ft – 43559 sq. ft.) and large 
(1 acre and above) property owners across Barbados, 
including government, to trade energy equivalency 
licenses (EEL) at their discretion, subject to any 
accompanying relevant trade regulations and national 
development plans. The study will also explore and 
make recommendations addressing situations in which 
individuals reside in a structure that they own, while 
not being the actual owners of the land on which the 
structure is stationed. This consideration centres on the 
IP’s commitment to creating the largest possible base of 
local involvement in the transition to 100% FFF. With this 
approach, every property owner in Barbados will have a 
calculated stake in the paradigm shift to becoming  
100% FFF. 
The EEL can therefore create 
many avenues for small, 
medium and large-scale 
economic activity across 
Barbados, thereby favourably 
affecting employment and 
foreign exchange generation.

engagements to incorporate other critical sectors 
throughout the project cycle.
This IP will operate effectively under specific conditions 
that are assumed to be in operational alignment with 
the approach of the Ministry of Energy and Water 
Resources, as party responsible for overall quality 
assurance. These assumptions are: 
2.  Broad Stakeholder Participation – Although the 
working group sessions were well attended and 
representative of the core drivers of the IP, input from 
other critical stakeholders will be needed to fully 
align activities to the existing operations of relevant 
institutions. While this omission would normally 
implicate a less-than favourable progression towards 
reaching the outlined objectives, the IP is designed 
as a ‘working document’ with sufficient flexibility and 
adaptability to rapidly incorporate inputs at any given 
time, without compromising the overall quality of the 
outputs identified. To address this possible dilemma, 
the IP may receive additional inputs in the period 
between the establishment of the Project Steering 
Committee and the Inception Workshop. This will 
allow sufficient time to include considerations from 
other key agencies in advance of the PSC, outlining  
the scope of the IP during its kick-off workshop. 
These agencies include: 
1.  Management Arrangements – Implementation will 
be supervised by a team of officers, collectively a 
project management team, who will be tasked with 
delivering on the results outlined in the IP. 
2.  Working Groups – Thematic Working Groups will 
continue to meet and provide additional oversight to 
activities. 
3.  Working Groups – Additional stakeholders from 
under and/or non-represented thematic areas will 
be integrated into the IP 
4.  Responsible Parties - Stakeholders (MOU etc.)  
will formally commit to being champions of the 
various activities to which they are identified as 
Responsible Parties.

5.  Public Communication - Developments regarding

•  Ministry of Youth and Community Empowerment 
6.  Resource Coordination Team (RCT) - An RCT, 
dedicated to identifying financing opportunities for 
the activities in the IP, will be established. 
Throughout the development of the IP, there were a 
number of factors taken into consideration, to which 
timely adjustments were made with a view to preserving 
the integrity and quality of the IP. These considerations 
include:
With regards to the energy targets, at this stage the IP 
presents preliminary forecasts of requirements for key 
variables. These values are to be likely revised following 
the completion of the Integrated Resource Plan by the 
Barbados Light and Power Company Ltd. Therefore, the 
IP acknowledges in advance that possible amendments 
may impact the predictions for:
1.  Consultation Time frame - The IP, which involved the 
assessment of 92 policy measures via 5 workshops and 
35 individual interviews, resulted in the identification 
of 145 enabling activities over the period November 19, 
2018 through December 14, 2018. This narrow timeline 
resulted in the prioritisation of thematic areas based 
on input from a wide range of relevant documents 
(e.g. Barbados Second National Communication, 
2015). Therefore, within this IP some thematic areas 
appear disproportionately represented. However, in 
light of this fact, the IP will advance working group

RISK REGISTER GUIDELINES
Description of Risk Register Column
Helpful Hints for Risk Assessment
Once risks are identified, 
they should be given a unique 
identification number, beginning 
with 1.
Identification number of each risk.  
No.:
The name used should be 
consistent for each focal area
The name of the project.  
Project:
Generally, the risk breakdown 
structure is a way of categorising 
or grouping risks by the potential 
cause of the risk.
The primary category or functional 
area that the risk pertains to. 
Category:
 
 
Opportunity/Threat:
Risk identified as an opportunity in 
the assessment section of the risk 
register.
 
Opportunity
Risk identified as a threat in the 
assessment section of the risk 
register.
 
Threat
Risk identified as an opportunity and 
a threat in the assessment section of 
the risk register.
 
Opportunity/Threat:
In the identification process, 
think about risks relevant to the 
project scope, schedule, or cost.  
Additionally think of risks that may 
affect the agency's reputation.
Brief, generally unique, description of 
the risk specific to the Project.
Summary Description:
The goal is to ensure that other 
users of the register can interpret 
the risk identified. Try to be 
specific and not overly vague.  
Sample risk statement templates 
are "If <uncertain event> -> then 
<effect on objectives>." or "Due 
to <definite cause>, <uncertain 
event> may occur, resulting in 
<effect on objectives>.
Detailed description of the risk, 
generally including a "cause", possible 
"risk event", and "effects".
Detailed Description:
 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR BARBADOS NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY  |  89
The estimated likelihood in percent 
(%) of the risk occurring based 
on current state of the risk. For 
subsequent risk assessments as 
response plans are implemented, the 
value should reflect the estimated 
probability at the time of assessment.
 
Probability:
The estimated most likely cost 
impact of the risk if it were to 
occur (in millions of dollars). For 
subsequent risk assessments as 
response plans are implemented, the 
value should reflect the estimated 
impact at the time of assessment.
 
Most Likely (Cost):
 
 
Response Category:
 
 
Threat Response - Pick One
Indicates that the project team has 
decided not to change the project 
plan to deal with a risk, or is unable 
to identify any other suitable 
response strategy. It should be noted, 
that mitigation or transference is 
not necessary for all risk threats, 
particularly those with a small 
severity rating. Judgment must be 
used as to whether a more rigorous 
(and potentially costly) response 
should be implemented.
If "accept" is chosen as the 
response, generally the pre-and 
post-response assessment ratings 
remain the same.
Accept
Allocates a portion of ownership of 
a risk threat to another party who is 
best able to minimise the impact and/
or probability of the risks.
Allocates all or a portion of 
ownership of a risk opportunity 
to another party who is best able 
to maximise its probability of 
occurrence and increase the potential 
benefits if it does occur.
Share
 
90  |  IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR BARBADOS NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY
If "mitigate" is chosen as the 
response, generally the  
pos-response assessment is 
lower than the pre-response 
assessment.
Seeks to reduce the probability and/
or impact of a risk threat to below an 
acceptable threshold.
Mitigate
If "transfer" is chosen as the 
response, generally the post 
response assessment is lower than 
the pre-response assessment. If 
the risk were fully transferred with 
no residual risk, the post-response 
assessment would equal zero.  
Allocates all ownership of a risk 
threat to another party who is best 
able to minimise the impact and/or 
probability of the risk.
Transfer
Involves changing the project plan 
to eliminate the risk threat or to 
protect the project objectives from 
its impact. 
If "avoid" is chosen as the 
response, generally the risk is 
totally eliminated in the post 
response assessment.
Avoid
Response plans should be specific 
enough to implement. It is okay to 
include steps to implementation.  
For example, further study may 
be needed (prior to implementing 
a response plan) to determine 
whether it would be effective; or 
options may need to be evaluated 
and decided upon by the project 
team prior to implementation.  
Owners assigned are those who are 
best able to monitor the risk and 
implement the response.  More than 
one owner can be assigned, but it 
should be clear what each owner is 
responsible for.
Primary plan to address the risk.
Response:
If multiple people are assigned as 
owners, it should be clear what each 
of their roles are and what they are 
individually responsible for.
Person or people assigned to 
implement the response plan and 
monitor the risk. 
Risk Owner:
 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR BARBADOS NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY  |  91
 
Status:
Risk is being actively monitored and 
controlled, but the response plan has 
not been initiated.
 
Active (Not Started)
Risk is being actively monitored and 
controlled, and the response plan is 
currently being implemented.
 
Active (Ongoing)
The risk is still being actively 
monitored and controlled; however 
all work on the response plan is 
complete.
 
Active (Complete)
Risk is not currently a high priority, 
but may become active in the future.
This status is not often used.
Dormant (Not Started)
Risks that are no longer applicable 
should be listed as "retired" and 
not deleted from the register.
Risk is no longer a threat to project 
objectives.
Retired (Complete)
Utilise the comments section 
to provide updates on actions 
or owners, or to note changes 
associated with the response 
plans.
