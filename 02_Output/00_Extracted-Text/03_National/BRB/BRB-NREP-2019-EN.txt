BARBADOS NATIONAL
ENERGY POLICY
2019-2030
SUMMARY
Barbados National Energy Policy / 2019-2030
Energy security and
aﬀordability through
diversity and collaboration: 
Establishing and
maintaining a sustainable 
energy sector
for Barbados.
The Barbados National Energy Policy 
(BNEP) 2019-2030 document is
designed to achieve the 100% 
renewable energy and carbon neutral 
transformational goals by 2030, 
becoming the ﬁrst island-state
in the world to do so.
Our goal
is to be 
100%
renewable 
by 2030!
BNEP is an energy revolution that will 
enrich the lives of all Barbadians and 
inspire others around the world.
Over the years, Barbados has sought to 
maintain an energy sector where energy 
resources are universally available at 
reasonable prices. The island can be 
proud of the fact that there is virtually 
100% access to electricity.

Barbados National Energy Policy / 2019-2030
Speciﬁc goals include:
Provision of reliable, 
safe, aﬀordable,
sustainable, modern 
and climate friendly 
energy services to 
all residents and 
visitors.
Zero domestic 
consumption of 
fossil fuels
economy wide.
Export of all 
hydrocarbons 
produced both 
on land and 
oﬀshore.
Maximising local
participation
(individual and
corporate) in
distributed renewable 
energy (RE) generation
and storage
(democratisation of 
energy).
Minimise the 
outflow of 
foreign
exchange.
Creating a
regional centre 
of excellence in 
RE research and 
development.

Barbados National Energy Policy / 2019-2030
Current
situation:
Barbados is energy import-dependent 
and relies on trade to meet its energy 
needs. Consequently, a momentary 
disruption or trade imbalance can lead 
to uncertainty in access to energy as 
prices fluctuate on the world market.
Target 
energy mix:
A way of mitigating these impacts is to 
reduce the volume of carbon dioxide 
emissions by increasing the use of 
renewable energy technologies or 
investing more in energy efficiency.
In this way, we will also help to protect 
the environment and ﬁght climate 
change.
Currently, over 90% of the energy used 
for electricity production in Barbados
is derived from carbon-based fuels 
which is a drain on foreign exchange 
resources.
“Due to their size and location, Caribbean 
SIDS are particularly susceptible to the 
impacts of climate change. As developing 
economies relying on sectors vulnerable
to climate patterns such as tourism, 
agriculture and ﬁshing, Caribbean nations 
would be greatly aﬀected by the ongoing 
rise in sea levels, changes in rain patterns 
and temperatures, and increasing
intensity of natural disasters identiﬁed by 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC).” (IADB, 2016)
The country’s goal is to ensure a smooth 
energy transition, with the development 
of the oﬀshore and onshore resources, 
building revenue for the country and 
skills that can be exported. The oﬀshore 
resources are yet to be explored, but 
preliminary studies suggest  there
are promising potential resources, 
especially natural gas, laying under
the ocean.

Barbados National Energy Policy / 2019-2030
Four main types of
energy will be explored:
4 types of energy
4 the future:
solar, wind, ocean
and biomasss
All relevant entities in Barbados shall work together to identify priority geographical areas 
for renewable energy.

Barbados National Energy Policy / 2019-2030
Objectives:
49%
Fossil fuel reduction
by 2023
52%
Increase in renewable
energy by 2023
100%
Increase in renewable
energy by 2030
100%
Fossil fuel reduction
by 2030 
The proposed target mix is anticipated to result in:
 An annual total energy savings of $400 - $800 million per year at current market prices. 
 Help protect the environment by displacing approximately 2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.
 The beneﬁt to Barbados is estimated at $3.9 billion annually from the removal of fossil fuels.
