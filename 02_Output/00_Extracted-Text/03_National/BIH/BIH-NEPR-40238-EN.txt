A) Energy Resources & Power Sector overview
Country Report – Bosnia and Herzegovina / JICA JFY 2010 PROGRAM - Energy Policy NO. J1000606 / ID. 1080149
Basic domestic energy - Coal
Bosnia and Herzegovina has available 
significant reserves of lignite and brown 
coal usable for generation of electricity 
applying existing (classic) technology or 
through new energy combustion and 
transformation technologies.
The existing TPPs in BiH consume average 
annually around 8 mil.tons of appropriate 
types and qualities of coal, that surely must 
be supplied until the end of the existing 
TPPs lifetime.
Estimates are that aggregate coal reserves 
in BiH amount: 
a) Brown Coal 
1.886 mil.tons
b) Lignite  
3.578 mil.tons
Total
5.464 mil.tons.
This is preconditions for long-run coal 
supply to the existing TPPs and for 
construction of new ones as well. When 
doing so, there must be taken care of 
optimal choice of new boilers in thermal 
power plants according to realistically 
available qualities and structures of coals.

Basic domestic energy - Hydro
Bosnia and Herzegovina's geography includes 
fast-flowing mountain streams and powerful 
rivers that are very well suited for 
hydroelectricity production. Currently, 
hydroelectric power stations exist with a 
generating capacity of around 6,500 MW. Most 
of these installations are more than 30 years 
old; modernization of the existing plants is in 
the pipeline. In 2007 Bosnia generated 6,140 
GWh of hydroelectricity, which was a 5 percent 
generation increase from the previous year 
(EIA, 2006).
It is estimated that Bosnia has a hydropower 
potential of 23,400 GWh. Most of the potential 
is located within the Drina, Neretva and 
Trebisnjica river basins. The Drina River alone 
is estimated to have a power generating 
potential of about 6,000 GWh.

Alternative domestic energy (RES) – Small Hydros, Wind, Solar, Geothermal…
Small Hydros Bosnia has an estimated small 
hydro power potential of 2,500 GWh/yr., what is the 
potential to support app. 356 large and small 
hydroelectric power stations. Since 2006, a total of 
120 licenses have been issued for new mini 
hydroelectric power stations; mini hydroelectric 
power stations have capacities not in excess of 10 
MW.

Wind A wind atlas for Bosnia and Herzegovina 
was recently established. The assessment shows 
that Bosnia and Herzegovina has significant wind 
potential. It is estimated that the total wind power 
potential capacity is about 2,000 MW, but only 900 
MW are usable. This potential has not yet been 
exploited. 
Solar The solar irradiation values in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina vary accordingly with about 1,240 
kWh/m2 in the northern region to 1,600 kWh/m2 in 
the southern region. In the southern region, the 
amount of sunny days can get up to about 270 days 
per year. The solar potential of the region is 
approximately 1,900 TWh.

Geothermal energy  According to available 
data, Bosnia & Herzegovina has a geothermal 
potential of 33 MWth. Due to the low temperatures, 
however, current activities relating to geothermal 
energy continue to be limited to exploitation for 
thermal use. 
Biofuels, Biogas etc – negligible 
implementation, some pilot projects under 
preparation

Imported energy – Oil & Gas
Oil sector Bosnia and Herzegovina Gas oil 
infrastructure comprises the oil products 
distribution capacities, especially for motor fuels, 
oils and lubricants. The greatest share of the 
market is covered by small private distributors. 
The demand for motor fuels on the domestic 
market in the present conditions is approximately 
1.5 million tons annually. The oil refinery delivers 
around 500,000 tons to the market, and the rest 
is imported. Considering that the number of 
private petrol stations is on the increase and has 
reached approximately 300 stations, objective 
estimates suggest that the commercial capacities 
in BiH market are already oversized. Some 
preliminary investigations have proved significant 
Oil reserves in BiH.
Gas All natural gas is imported from the 
Russian Federation and is transported to BiH via 
the gas transport systems in Ukraine, Hungary 
and Yugoslavia. Due to the above mentioned 
post-war dissolution of the energy system, BiH is 
facing an absurd situation – in the entire gas 
transport (over 5000 km) from the gas wells in 
Siberia to Sarajevo (which is the main consumer 
in BiH) the intermediaries involved in the internal 
transport of gas in BiH outnumber the transport 
intermediaries up to the BiH border. The main 
features of the gas system in BiH are: length of 
191 km and the projected annual capacities of 1 
billion m3. The existing leased transport 
capacities to BiH are 750 million m3/year.

Energy Policy – key facts
Rather complex political/administrative constitution of Bosnia-
Herzegovina is affecting all segments of B-H economy, incl. Energy 
(Power) Sector:
Energy policy should be just one segment of the overall national
Economy policy (harmonized with other sectors) and, also 
harmonized with regional Energy sector:
Bosnia-Herzegovina has no independent Energy Institute, all 
technical activities are performed by three ministries (two on the 
entity level – FMERI & MERI, and state level Department at the 
Ministry of Foreign trade and Economic Relations – MOFTER). This 
causes harmful effect – we do not have proper Energy Balance,  
Statistics, Analyses and Energy Forecasts. 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is in the middle of the EU integration process 
- “EU pressure” is the key driving force in all internal reforms, incl. 
Energy sector. This is the most important and most positive aspect.
Bosnia-Herzegovina has promising energy resources and, there 
is one excellent opportunity to get the status of relevant regional 
energy exporter. Two thirds of total Power production was based on 
coal. This ratio is likely to remain, but new TPP technologies must 
be utilized: 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has significant RES potentials which were 
not seriously utilized, so far. New Tariff policy is the key prerequisite 
to this. New, RES encouraging tariffs are on the horizon:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion: The major goal of the B&H Energy policy, in the next 
decade, would be – to modernize (re-power) existing Generation 
capacities, new Energy related investments and development of the 
new Energy Management Infrastructure.
