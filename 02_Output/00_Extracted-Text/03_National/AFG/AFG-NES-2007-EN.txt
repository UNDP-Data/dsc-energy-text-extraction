Vision for Afghanistan 

By the solar year 1400 (2020), Afghanistan will be: 

(cid:131)  A stable Islamic constitutional democracy at peace with itself and its neighbors, standing 

with full dignity in the international family. 

(cid:131)  A tolerant, united, and pluralist nation that honors its Islamic heritage and deep 

aspirations toward participation, justice, and equal rights for all. 

(cid:131)  A society of hope and prosperity based on a strong, private sector-led market economy, 

social equity, and environmental sustainability. 

ANDS Goals for 1387-1391 (2008-2013) 

is  a  Millennium 
The  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy  (ANDS) 
Development  Goals  (MDGs)-based  plan  that  serves  as  Afghanistan’s  Poverty 
Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP).  It  is  underpinned  by  the  principles,  pillars  and 
benchmarks of the Afghanistan Compact. The pillars and goals of the ANDS are:  

1.  Security:    Achieve  nationwide  stabilization,  strengthen  law  enforcement,  and  improve 

personal security for every Afghan. 

2.  Governance,  Rule  of  Law  and  Human  Rights:    Strengthen  democratic  practice  and 
institutions,  human  rights,  the  rule  of  law,  delivery  of  public  services  and  government 
accountability. 

3.  Economic  and  Social  Development:    Reduce  poverty,  ensure  sustainable  development 
through  a  private  sector-led  market  economy,  improve  human  development  indicators, 
and make significant progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.

AFGHANISTAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS) 

 
  
In the name of Allah, the most Merciful, the most Compassionate 

Six  and  half  years ago,  the  people  of Afghanistan  and  the  international  community  joined  hands  to 
liberate Afghanistan from the grip of international terrorism and begin the journey to rebuild a nation 
stunned by a long past of violence, destruction and terror. We have come a long way in this shared 
journey. 

In just a few years, as a result of the partnership between Afghanistan and the international community, 
we  were  able  to  draw  up  a  new,  Constitution,  embracing  the  values  of  democracy,  freedom  of  speech 
and  equal  rights  for  women.  Afghans  voted  in  their  first  ever  presidential  elections  and  elected  a  new 
parliament.  Close  to  five  million  Afghan  refugees  have  returned  home,  making  it  one  of  the  largest 
movement of people to their homeland in history.   

Thousands  of  schools  have  been  built;  over  six  million  boys  and  girls  have  been  enrolled,  the  highest 
level  ever  for  Afghanistan.  Hundreds  of  health  clinics  have  been  established  boosting  our  basic  health 
coverage from 9 percent six years ago to over 85 percent today. Access to diagnostic and curative services 
has increased from almost none in 2002 to more than forty percent now. We have rehabilitated 12,200 km 
of  roads.  Our  rapid  economic  growth,  with  double  digit  growth  almost  every  year,  has  led  to  higher 
income and better living conditions for our people. With a developing network of roads and a state-of-
the-art communications infrastructure, Afghanistan is better placed to serve as an economic land-bridge 
in our region.   

These  achievements  would  not  have  been  possible  without  the  unwavering  support  of  the 
international  community  and  the  strong  determination  of  the  Afghan  people.  I  hasten  to  point  out 
that  our  achievements  should  not  make  us  complacent  distracting  to  face  the  enormity  of  the  tasks 
that are still ahead. The threat of terrorism and the menace of narcotics are still affecting Afghanistan 
and  the  broader  region  and  hampering  our  development.  Our  progress  is  still  undermined  by  the 
betrayal  of  public  trust  by  some  functionaries  of  the  state  and  uncoordinated  and  inefficient  aid 
delivery  mechanisms.  Strengthening  national  and  sub-national  governance  and  rebuilding  our 
judiciary are also among our most difficult tasks.  

To  meet  these  challenges,  I  am  pleased  to  present  Afghanistan’s  National  Development  Strategy 
(ANDS). This strategy has been completed after two years of hard work and extensive consultations 
around the country. As an Afghan-owned blueprint for the development of Afghanistan in all spheres 
of  human  endeavor,  the  ANDS  will  serve  as  our  nation’s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper.  I  am 
confident  that  the  ANDS  will  help  us  in  achieving  the  Afghanistan  Compact  benchmarks  and 
Millennium Development Goals. I also consider this document as our roadmap for the long-desired 
objective  of  Afghanization,  as  we  transition  towards  less  reliance  on  aid  and  an  increase  in  self-
sustaining economic growth. 

I thank the international community for their invaluable support. With this Afghan-owned strategy, I 
ask all of our partners to fully support our national development efforts. I am strongly encouraged to 
see the participation of the Afghan people and appreciate the efforts of all those in the international 
community and Afghan society who have contributed to the development of this strategy. Finally, I 
thank the members of the Oversight Committee and the ANDS Secretariat for the preparation of this 
document.

AFGHANISTAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS) 

 
 
In the name of Allah, the most Merciful, the most Compassionate 

We  are  pleased  to  present  the  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy,  which  reflects  the 
commitment  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  to  poverty  reduction  and  private  sector-led 
economic growth for a prosperous and stable Afghanistan.  The ANDS Oversight Committee (OSC) 
was  mandated  by  the  Government  to  produce  a  Millennium  Development  Goals-based  national 
strategy  that  is Afghan-owned  and meets  the requirements  for  a Poverty  Reduction Strategy  Paper.  
The  OSC  met  on  a  regular  basis  to  design,  discuss  and  oversee  the  development  of  the  strategy, 
including  the  identification  of  the  needs  and  grievances  of  the  people,  and  the  prioritization  of 
resource  allocations  and  actions.  To  embrace  ‘Afghanization”  and  ownership,  the  OSC  facilitated 
inclusive and extensive consultations both at national and sub-national levels.  

Sustained  fiscal  support  and  continuous  evaluation  and  monitoring  are  essential  now  to  meet  the 
challenges ahead related to ANDS implementation.  The democratic aspirations of the Afghan people 
are high, yet financial resources remain limited.  While much has been accomplished since 2001, more 
remains  to  be  done  as  we  move  from “Compact to Impact”.  The  Afghan  Government  with support 
from  the  international  community  must  act  decisively,  strategically,  and  with  an  absolute 
commitment to the ANDS goals and vision.   

We  look  forward  to  working  with  our  government  colleagues,  civil  society  representatives,  tribal 
elders and religious scholars, the private sector, the international community and, most importantly, 
fellow  Afghans  to  implement  the  ANDS,  to  help  realize  the  Afghanistan  Compact  benchmarks  and 
Millennium Development Goals.

EXECUTIVE 
SUMMARY 

ENERGY SECTOR STRATEGY 

Afghanistan’s  energy  sector  and  its  economy 
are  at  a  crossroads.    Energy,  abundantly  and 
cost  effectively  supplied,  can  be  a  very 
sustainable 
important 
the 
in 
input 
development  of  Afghanistan. 
  However, 
energy  is  no  panacea.  In  fact,  if  it  is  supplied 
imprudently, 
instead  being  a  vehicle  for 
growth,  it  will  pull  down  the  Government’s 
development  efforts  and  be  a  drag  on 
economic  growth. 
  Capital  investment  in 
energy is rising rapidly attesting to the efforts 
to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (IROA) 
and  the  donor  community.    At  the  same  time 
though,  the  efficiency  of  energy  operations  is 
not increasing.  If left unchecked, much of the 
investment that is being made will be wasted. 

To  illustrate  this  gravity  of  the  problem,  the 
cost  of  losses  has  been  estimated.    Because  of 
the state of the infrastructure and the familiar 
short  comings  of  Government  owned  and 
operated 
are 
enormous.    Losses  in  2005  amounted  US$ 
128.5 million. 

energy  provision,

Annual Impact of Poor Commercial 
Operations and Subsidies 

The  actual  cost  to  the  economy  is  greater!  
What  this  highlights  is  that  continuing  to 
operate  on  a  business  as  usual  basis  is 
unsustainable.  The number one priority in the 
energy sector must be on operating efficiency:  

commercialization  of  DABM,  investments  in 
transmission and distribution to reduce losses, 
and,  repair  and  maintenance  of  all  power 
assets.  Moreover, it is important to focus now 
on  efficient  use  of  energy  and  the  enabling 
policy, 
frameworks 
should address this issue.  

legal  and  regulatory 

When  this  is  considered  against  the  Afghan 
Compact  Goals,  the  importance  of  efficiency 
becomes  even  more  important.    By  2010  the 
number  of  connections  to  meet  the  AC  goals 
will  rise  by  211  percent  while  capacity  will 
increase only 194%, assuming that imports go 
according  to  plan.    This  means  that  unless 
there  are  changes  in  efficiency,  the  average 
kWh consumed per connection must go down.  
This  is  not  a  recipe  for  economic  growth.  
Compounding  the  problem  and  not  included 
in this analysis are that the demand for power 
will  actually  rise  and 
that  with  more 
connections  the  cost  of  un-served  energy  will 
rise.    While  it  is  imperative  that  additional 
infrastructure  be  added,  it  is  even  more 
important  that  the  IROA  focus  on  efficiency.  
While  much  can  be  done  by  the  Government, 
the real solution lies in creating and expanding 
a meaningful role for the private sector. 

Realizing that  the  Afghan  economy is  starved 
of  reliable  and  cost  effective  energy,  the 
immediate  task  of  the  IROA,  with  assistance 
from the Donor community, is then to provide 
energy to those that can use best use and pay 
for  it  (and  that  may  well  be  business),  in  the 
quantities  and  quality  that  they  need,  at  a 
price  that  covers  cost  (for  all  but  the  poorest 
members of society), and to do so in the most 
cost  effective  manner.    At  the  same  time 
though,  it  must  begin  to  take  steps  that  will 
provide a solid footing for the transition of the 
sector  from  Government  provision  to  Private 
Sector  provision.    This  strategy  acknowledges 
that there are many steps that need to be taken

of  Afghanistan 

The  availability  of  secure  energy  supplies 
significantly 
within  Afghanistan  was 
disrupted  by  the  conflicts  of  the  past  two 
decades.  Post-conflict  efforts  by  the  Islamic 
Republic 
and 
international  donors  to  date  have  focused  on 
expanding the availability of energy resources 
throughout  the  country.  Particular  emphasis 
has  been  on  expanding  and  rehabilitating  the 
electricity sector in the major economic hubs of 
the  country  and  providing  basic  service  in 
rural  areas.  Efforts  also  have  been  taken  to 
improve  the  supply  of  natural  gas,  increase 
availability  of  hydro-electric  generation, 
rehabilitate and expand electricity and natural 
gas  transmission  and  distribution  systems, 
develop  renewable  energy  resources  in  rural 
and  remote  areas,  increase  low-cost  power 
imports  and  improve  the  capability  of  energy 
sector institutions. 

Since  2001,  Afghanistan  energy  efforts  have 
focused  on  “bailing  out  the  boat”  or  keeping 
the lights on and providing heat in the winter.  
At  some  point,  one  must  also  focus  on 
stopping the flow of water before they become 
exhausted.  The  short  term  focused  activities 
alone  can  continue  only  so  long  before  the 
long  term  growth  path  of  the  country  is 
adversely 
  Having  achieved 
moderate  success  in  these  areas,  the  time  is 
ripe to review current activities and programs 
and  place  greater  emphasis  on  behalf  of  the 
IROA  and  donors  on  a  more  long-range, 
sustainable  future  for  the  energy  sector.  This 
would  include  balancing  on-going  efforts  to 
rehabilitate and expand energy resources with 
a longer-term strategy for the sector. 

impacted. 

The  Afghan  Energy  Strategy  contains  an 
implicit  prioritization  of  energy  sub-sector 
activities. 
  Electricity  is  given  far  greater 
preference  or  priority  than  other  sectors 
because  modern  economies  are  built  on 
electricity.    Priority  is  then  assigned  to  other 
sub-sectors  based  on  their  supporting  role  in 
electricity and in overall economic activity.  In 
practical  terms  this  means  that  MoM  and 

to  prioritize

their  policies, 
programs and projects towards the production 
of fuels for electricity generation.  The strategy 
is based on five3 prongs or pillars.

establishing  a  multi-sector 
regulator, 
looking  to  outsource  at  State  Owned 
Enterprises,  preparing  the  enabling  legal, 
policy  and  regulatory  infrastructure  for 
business,  and  the  commercialization  of 
SOEs.   

3.  Improved  Coordination  and  Capacity 
Development:  Additionally,  coordination 
among  the  Government  entities  must 
increase  and  coordination  between  the 
Government  and  the  Donor  community 
must likewise be strengthened.  Assistance 
needs  to  be  given  to  ICE  to  strengthen  its 
capacity.    An  integrated  energy  master 
plan is required to serve as a road map for 
the  Government  and  Donors  alike.    To 
accomplish

significantly  strengthened  and  training  is 
an imperative

4.  Rural Energy versus Rural Electrification: 
Most  rural  Afghans  are  unable  to  pay  for 
expensive  electricity.    Energy  is  required 
for growth but energy alone won’t do  the 
job.    The  role  of  rural  energy  to  seek  out 
opportunities  for  economic  activities  that 
lack  energy,  that  will  pay  for  energy  and

can 

These  are  the  pillars  of  Afghanistan’s  near 
term  energy  strategy.    Alongside  addressing 
the  immediate  and  short  term  needs,  it  is 
imperative  that  the  country  look  to  longer 
term  issues.    Because  it  is  building  its  energy 
infrastructure  anew,  it  can  learn  from  the 
lessons of experience in other countries. It can 
focus  on  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy 
and decentralized energy.  If it does this at the 
same time it builds its industrial base, then the 
benefits are enormous.  Thus, while a national 
grid  is  important  to  transport  power  from 
cheaper markets, it will prove more beneficial 
in  the  long  run  to  focus  on  decentralized 
power.  A  recent  British  study  concluded  that 
61  percent  of  the  energy  value  of  the  primary 
fuel disappears.  “Another 4 percent vanished 
in  transmission.”    This  means  that  roughly 
two thirds of the energy is lost in a centralized 
system.    By  locating  power  generation  closer 
to users, these losses can be significantly  

reduced.    Thus,  the  long  term  strategy  will 
increasingly focus on cogeneration, distributed 
power,  renewable  and  end-use  efficiency  as 
well as the more traditional areas. 

The  strategy  is  focused  on  poverty  reduction 
through all its five pillars.  First, by improving 
operating efficiency, the drain on government 
resources  is  reduced.  More  is  available  for 
other  programs.    Similarly,  by  focusing  on 
end-use efficiency, the drain on the customer’s 
resources is reduced.  More of their income is 
available for other things.  Second, improving 
sector  governance  will  also  have  a  significant 
impact  on  poverty.    It  will  bring  about  better 
subsidy  mechanisms  so  that  the  subsidy  is 
targeted  to  those  that  need  it  the  best  way 
possible.  While it will reduce the overall level 
of  subsidy  in  the  sector  but  the  neediest 
members of society will have access to energy 
at subsidized  rates.   Moreover,  every Afghani 
of  subsidy  that  can  be  freed  up  in  this  sector 
can  be  used  in  other  sectors.    Third,  this 
strategy  reorients  rural  energy  to  focus  on 
income  generating  activities. 
  Thus,  by 
definition  this  is  a  poverty  reduction  activity.  
Fourth,  the  economy  is  starved  for  energy.

means 232.5 MWH and at $0.12 per kWh3, the 
cost  of  these  losses  amounts  to  $27.9  million

are commercial losses.  This covers everything 
from theft to that the fact that (1) not all power

The  total  cost  of  losses  and  subsidies  equaled 
$128.5  million  in  2005.    The  actual  cost  to  the 
economy  is  greater!    What  this  highlights  is 
that  continuing  to  operate  on  a  business  as 
usual basis is unsustainable.  The number one 
priority  in  the  energy  sector  must  be  on 
efficiency: 
  commercialization  of  DABM, 
investments  in  transmission  and  distribution 
to reduce losses, repair and maintenance of all 
power assets.  Changing business as usual also 
means  changing  how  subsidies  are  provided.  
For  example, 
if  DABM  provided  each 
connection  with  one  CFL  to  replace  one 
incandescent bulb at the manufacturers cost of 
$5, it would save 38.8 thousand mwh per year 
in  generation  and  reduce  its  losses  by  $US  3 
million  per  year.    It  would  cost  DABM  only 
$1.2 million  to  change  out  the  bulbs,  a  rate  of 
return  of  17%  and  the  bulb  program  would 
pay for itself in 2.5 years. Beyond the financial 
rewards,  this  is  the  easiest  way  to  reduce 
commercial  losses  and  make  more  power 
available.    This  is  equivalent  to  a  38.8  MW 
boost in power with no additional investment 
and  in  a  very  short  time  frame.    A  38.8  MW 
power  plant  would  cost  on  the  order  of  $40 
million.

Afghanistan’s  energy  sector  and  its  economy

linking  income  generating  activities  to  energy 
and  this  means  providing  a  slate  of  energy

coordination  among  ministries  and  agencies 
and it may mean subordinating one Ministries

an  overview  of  Afghanistan’s  energy  sector

The  goal  of  the  Afghanistan  Energy  Sector 
Strategy  is  to  deliver  sufficient  energy  to 
support      economic  growth  of  about  9%  per 
annum,4  which 
lower 
poverty by 3% a year5 and to do so in the most 
cost effective manner.  In accordance with the 
AC, this is translated into the following sector 
specific goals.  

in  turn  will  help 

By end-2010: electricity will reach at least 
65% of households and 90% of non- 

residential establishments in major urban 
areas and at least 25% of households in  

rural areas; at least 75% of the costs will be 
recovered from users connected  

to the national power grid. A strategy for the 
development and use of renewable energies 

 will be developed by end-2007.” 

Economic  growth  that  raises  incomes  and 
reduces  poverty  is  strongly  correlated  with 
increased  energy  use.  Energy  is  used  in  the 
production  process  of  every  sector  of  the 
economy.  The  provision  of  adequate  and 
reliable energy services at affordable and cost-
based  prices, in a  secure and environmentally 
sustainable  manner,  and  in  conformity  with 
social and economic development needs, is an 
essential  element  of  sustainable  development. 
A  sufficient  supply  of  energy  is  a  vital  input 
for  eradicating  poverty,  improving  human 
welfare  and  raising  living  standards.  The 
correlation  between  commercial  energy  and 
development is aptly shown in Figure 3 where 
per capita GDP is measured against per capita 
energy  consumption.      If  Afghanistan  is  to 
grow and take its place among industrializing 
nations,  then  it  must  have  more  electricity, 

4  This  has  been  the  Government’s  growth  goal  for  the 
economy since 1383 (2004) (See: Securing Afghanistan’s 
Future), and is estimated to be sufficient growth to build 
a  legal  economy  while  eliminating  illicit  the  trade 
without causing devastating poverty.

Correlation  does  not  imply  causation  and 
adequate  supply  of  commercial  energy  is  a 
necessary  but  not  sufficient  condition  for 
economic  growth.    Economies  can’t  grow 
without  commercial  energy  but 
simply 
providing  more  energy  to  an  economy  does 
not  guarantee  growth.    What  this  means  for 
the Energy Sector Strategy is that energy must 
often  be  combined  with  other  interventions.  
Providing  adequate,  cost  effective  energy 
supplies to an area where there is commercial 
and/or  industrial  activity,  may  lower  costs 
and allow things to be done.  This in turn will 
create jobs and expand the economy.  Jobs will 
include  those  in  the  sector;  for  example, 
miners,  electrical  workers  and  oil  rig  workers 
as  well  as  those  in  industries  set  up  because 
energy  was  available.    However,  supplying 
the  same  energy  to  an  area  where  there  are 
few economic activities is no panacea.  In that 
case,  energy  supply  must  be  coupled  with 
economic  activity  if  it  is  to  be  effective  and 
sustainable.

The  Energy  sector  of  Afghanistan  has  the 
potential  to  drive  urban  and  rural  economic 
growth  for  years  to  come.  Energy  as  a 
commodity can provide essential supply service 
that  indirectly  helps  to  create  employment. 
Energy  is  purchased  by  consumers  to  power 
equipment, 
facilities  and  manufacturing 
processes  that  generate  income.  Energy  as  a 
business  can  create  direct  employment  in  the 
development of power plants, oil, gas and coal 
fields, the construction of grid systems and the 
commercial  operations  of  the  sector.  For  the 
rural  poor,  small  energy  installations  are 
highly 
cost-recovery  and 
in 
contribute  to  local  economic  development. 
Through  improved  sector  governance  and 
increased 
participation, 
budgetary  resources  may  be  improved  at  the 
national  and  provincial  levels.  In  addition,  as 
sector  governance 
improves,  poor  and

Energy as a service can have dramatic impact on 
urban  and  rural  health,  social  well  being, 
security and other quality of life aspects. Basic 
street  lighting  provides  security;  refrigeration 
and  cooling  for  medical  supplies  and  home 
light  and  heat  for  improved  family  living, 
schooling  and  comfort.  Increased  attention  to 
energy  use  can  result  in  improved  energy

THE STATE OF THE 
OVERALL ENERGY SECTOR 

As  mentioned  earlier,  modern  economies 
demand  energy  and  there  is  a  strong  direct 
relationship  between  per  capita  GDP  and  per 
capita energy consumption.  Economic growth 
is  not  accompanied  by  declining  energy 
consumption!    Perhaps  the  most  compelling 
description of the energy sector in Afghanistan 
is  shown  in  Figure  5.      In  1980,  the  per  capita 
energy  consumption  of  Afghanistan  was 
fourth  in  the  region,  greater  than  that  of  Sri 
Lanka  and  Bangladesh.    By  2004,  per  capita 
from 
consumption  had 

fallen  drastically 

slightly  less than 2 million BTU  per  person  to 
just around 0.5 million BTU.  This is at a time 
when  all  other  economies  in  region  exhibited 
jump  in 
strong  growth. 
consumption between the late 1980s and early 
1990s  was  due  to  the  export  of  natural  gas  to 
Russia.

Reliable  energy  data  for  Afghanistan  is  about 
as  scarce  as  energy  in  Afghanistan.  The  data

Energy Laboratory and other Afghan sources.

Electricity  (hydro  and  imports)  comprises  the

Energy in Afghanistan in recent history can be 
categorized  as  a  period  where  supply  has 
always  been  short  of  demand,  as  it  has  in 
many  similar  countries.      The  demand  for 
energy  outstrips  current  supply  in  every

Much  of  the  deficit  in  supply  can  be  blamed 
on the lack of investment, cannibalization and 
carnage  that  has  accompanied  Afghanistan’s 
civil  crises  since  1978.    As  civil  strife  strains

abandoned, routine maintenance is postponed; 
spares  are  taken  from  one  plant  for  another; 
skilled  human  resources  that  are  needed  to 
maintain  the  capital  stock  leave;  and  soon 
parts  are  stolen  and  sold  for  other  uses.    Sad 
and  unpreventable  as  this  is,  a  large  share  of 
the  gap  can  be  blamed  on  faulty  resource 
allocation  policies.  Subsidies,  as  they  are  so 
often  carried  out,  create  a  vicious  downward 
cycle.    For  example,  the  electric  utility  often 
does  not  collect  enough  to  pay  for  operating

(2) some energy that is consumed is not billed, 
(3)  some  energy  that  is  billed  is  not  collected,

enough,  it  begins  to  let  maintenance  slip  and

consumers  with  unreliable  service  see  less

lower, 
mentioned  earlier,  combined 
losses  and 
subsidies  are  costing  the  Government  $128.5 
million  annually.    As  can  be  clearly  seen  in 
Table  2,  this  is  unsustainable.    Given  that 
infrastructure  investments  are  growing  and 
increasingly  more  power  is  being  produced, 
unless  radical  changes  take  place,  losses  will 
steadily  climb.    These  losses  are  not  only  a 
drain  on  the  power  system.    They  represent 
resources that could be going to produce more 
energy  or  to  other  development  needs.    It  is 
clear that changing this must be a top priority 
in the electricity sector.

Electricity  drives  modern  economies  and  per 
capita 
in 
Afghanistan is one of the lowest in the world.  
After  a  long  period  of  decline,  generating 
capacity  is  beginning  to  grow  again.    Hydro 
plants  account  the  largest  share  of  capacity 
with imports in second place and growing.  

The  most  promising  long-term  resource  for 
power 
is 
hydropower,  which  accounts  for  over  50%  of

hydropower,  thermal  generation,  primarily 
diesel  generation,  supplies  power  mainly  to 
urban  areas.  Utilization  of  indigenous  fossil 
fuels 
for  power 
generation  is  very  limited  as  is  utilization  of 
solar,  wind  and  other  renewable  energy 
resources.  Reliance on diesel is both expensive 
and  environmentally  hazardous. 
  Diesel 
generation  costs  almost  30  US  cents  per  khw 
compared  to  natural  gas  at  3.5  US  cents  per 
kWh.  Efforts  are  underway  to  utilize  local 
natural  gas  for  power  production  and  this 
should remain a top priority.

6  In  the  1980  Master  Plan  it  was  estimated  that 
Afghanistan has the potential of developing about 23,000 
MW  of  additional  hydro  generating  capacity,  with 
18,000  MW  located  on  the  Panj  and  Amu  Rivers  that 
form  the  border  with  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan.  The 
remaining 5,000 MW potential is primarily in two areas, 
about 1,800 MW on the Kokcha River and 3,200 MW in 
the Kabul River basin. 
7  There  is  no  reliable  estimates  of  rural  electricity 
coverage; some anecdotal evidence, including discussions 
with  senior  executives  with    DABM,  indicates  coverage 
from  all  sources  is  over  7%,  other  estimates  place  it  as 
high as 14%.

Connecting  each  new  customer  to  the  system 
is expensive, and can cost up to $1,000 or more 
in  distribution  costs  alone.  For  Kabul,  total 
costs  to  expand  the  distribution  system  are 
$310  million.  Weak

distribution  systems  can  lead  to  significant 
power  losses,  with  estimates  for  the  Kabul

of cost of  coal fired capacity is available at this time. 

Table  4  shows  the  cost  of  generating  power 
from  various  sources  on  the  Afghanistan 
power  system.  The  cost  of  generation  differs 
significantly  and  displacing  diesel  generation 
with other energy sources through a least-cost 
expansion  plan  can  reduce  costs  significantly. 
Moreover, it excludes the cost of transmission 
and  distribution.    When  this  cost  is  included, 
extension  of  the  grid  may  often  be  more 
expensive 
than  decentralized  generation 
including many renewables. 

The  financial  condition  of  the  sector  and  the 
utility  is  going  from  bad  to  worse  because 
there  has  been  little  improvement  in  tariffs 
and  operations  while  at 
time 
substantial  assets  have  been  added  to  the 
system.    Maintaining  and  operating  these  is 
expensive  and  if  the  Government  does  not

and  maintaining  what  is  has,  the  burden  on

So,  what  Table  4  clearly  shows  that  if  DABM 
wants  to  expand  generation,  then  there  is  a 
rank order based on cost?  Clearly, hydro and 
imports  are  preferred  to  diesel  as  is  natural 
gas.  However, what Table 4 does not show is 
the  cost  of  increasing  electricity  supply  and 
this is a more important concept in the case of 
Afghanistan given both the imperatives of cost 
and  time.    Electricity  supply  can  be  increased 
by increasing generation, increasing efficiency 
(reducing  technical  and  commercial  losses) 
and by reducing the demand for electricity.  In

saving  of  46  watts.    Over  the  life  of  the  bulb, 
10,000  hours  on  average,  this  is  saving  of  657 
kWh.  If the bulb costs US$ 5, then the cost of 
freeing up a kWh is US subsidy amounts to 0.8 
US  cents  per  kWh  or  one  third  that  of  hydro 
and  it  takes  far  less  time  to  do  this.    If  the 

subsidy  is  considered,  then  the  Government 
actual  saves  money  by  helping  consumers    to 
be  more  efficient.    For  every  US$  5  the 
Government  spends  (on  a  new  CFL), 
it 
reduces  the  amount  it  spends  on  the  subsidy 
by US$ 51.  This can be seen in Figure 8.

never  operational.    To  increase  value  added

There  is  significant  solar  potential  but  it  still

  The  Indian  Government  has 
funded  a  solar  village  initiative.  While  solar 
PV  is  expensive  compared  to  the  cost  of 
generation  for  other  alternatives,  there  is 
strong evidence that with the proper enabling 
environment  of  micro  credit  and  training, 
solar  home  systems  are  a  viable  electricity 
source14.  Solar cookers have shown significant 
promise  in  other  countries  and  may  have

assistance15.16 The results from other countries 
consistently  indicate  that  there  is  a  hierarchy 
for  demand  to  services  and  electricity  is 
usually  further  down  on  the  ladder  than 
services  such  as  an  all  weather  road,  water 
supply,  schools,  and  clinics.    For  example,  if 
the  preponderance  of  survey  respondents 
already has access to road, water and schools, 
then  electricity  may  well  be  their  next  choice 
of  service.    In  rural-remote  Afghanistan,  if 
Afghans  are  similar  to  the  peoples  of  the 
region,  then  access  to  electricity  will  not  be 
their most urgent priority. 

Additionally,  experience  the  world  over  has 
provided  an  important  lesson  with  regard  to 
blindly  providing  access  to  electricity.    There 
is  no  guarantee  that  increased  access  to 
electricity  will  bring  economic  benefits.  
Simply look around in Kabul and other urban 
areas  where  residential  access  has  increased.  
If  access  to  electricity  is  not  targeted  to  or 
coupled  with  income  generating  activities, 
then rural access brings lighting and little else. 

8.   DEMAND 

Although  there  is  little  data  for  Afghanistan 
on  rural  energy  use,  inferences  can  be  drawn 
from similar countries in the region.  There is a 
tendency  to  assume  that  grid  connected 
electricity  offers  the  best  form  of  energy  for 
rural populations.  Experience throughout the 
world has shown that there is a progression in 
the use of energy.  Due to the dispersed nature 
of  the  rural  population,  renewable  energy 
offers  the  best  solution  for  electrification  for 
the majority of Afghanistan’s rural population 
to 
that  currently  does  not  have  access 

15  According  to  their  survey,  49%  of  rural  respondents 
had  access  to  electricity  and  89%  of  urban  respondents 
had  access.    Their  sample  was  not  representative  of  the 
country with regard to energy access.  In part, what they 
call  rural  actually  represents  sizable  population  centers.  
Moreover,  their  question  did  not  ask  if  access  to  energy 
was  an  issue  but  rather  the  extent  to  which  energy  is  a 
problem. 
16  The  distinction  between  rural  and  urban 
in 
Afghanistan  also  causes  blurring  of  responsibilities 
between  MEW  and  MRRD  and  so  we  use  the  term 
rural-remote to denote those areas of very low population 
density  that  are  far  removed  from  population  and 
commercial  centers  and  lack  access  to  basic  services.  
More will be developed on this later in the strategy.

Kerosene  lamps  are  the  major  source  of

there is  no monetary  outlay  or  charcoal.   This

much of a rural household’s money income is 
devoted  to  energy.    Using  detailed  data  for 
Balochistan, 
the  average  rural  household 
spends only 3.5% of its budget on energy and 
this  includes  imputed  or  noncash  outlays.

projects to promote micro-hydro development 
in  rural  areas.  In  addition,  under  the  US 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory, wind 
mapping has been undertaken for many parts 
of  Afghanistan  as  a  basis  for  developing 
individual  projects.  The  data  indicate  good 
potential  for  generating  wind  electricity  in 
several parts of the country. The lead institute 
to  support  development  of  these  resources  in 
Afghanistan is the National Renewable Energy 
Research  and  Development  Center,  a  part  of 
MEW. 

Hydropower,  solar,  wind  and  biomass  offer 
the  most  potential  to  contribute  to  energy 
supply.  Development,  however, 
requires 
institutional  and  financial  support, 
sound 
sustained  commitment  and  a 
long-term 
development  horizon.  Use  of  renewable 
energy  is  beset  by  a  number  of  factors, 
including  high  upfront  costs,21 
lack  of 
suppliers,  inadequate  financing  mechanisms, 
and weak institutional and technical capacity. 

10.  Afghanistan as an Energy 
Transit Route 

Due to its location between the oil and natural 
gas  reserves  of  the  Caspian  Basin  and  the 
Indian  Ocean,  Afghanistan  has  long  been 
mentioned  as  a  potential  energy  route.  This 
might  include  power  transmission  via  high 
tension  lines,  or  perhaps  eventually  a  gas 
pipeline.   

for  electricity  produced 

Afghanistan  is  well  positioned  to  be  a  transit 
route 
in  CAR 
countries  and  exported  to  South  Asia,  and 
perhaps eventually it might also become a net 
exporter  of  power  produced  from  its  own 
hydro, natural gas, and coal resources. Efforts 
are  currently  underway  to  increase  electricity 
imports 
Tajikistan, 
from  Uzbekistan, 
Turkmenistan  and  Iran  and  to  upgrade  cross-
border  transmission  links.  Development  of  a 
regional power network with Afghanistan as a 
transit  route  between  CAR  and  South  Asia  is 
potential  medium-term 
an 
objective. 

important 

21  For  example,  estimate  for  Photovoltaic  electricity,  as 
per  MRRD  (Mostafa  Torkan,  May  24,  2007) 
is 
$12,000/kW,  as  compared  to:  (i)  Micro-hydropower  at 
$1,200/kW and Diesel generated power at $500/kW. 

At  the  present  time,  with  support  from  the 
ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  the  four  countries 
of  Tajikistan,  Kyrgyzstan,  Afghanistan  and 
Pakistan are actively exploring construction of 
a  high  tension  line  that  would  transmit  1300 
MW  of  power  from  Central  Asia  through 
Afghanistan 
to  Pakistan,  with  Pakistan 
receiving 1,000 MW, and Afghanistan gaining 
300  MW.    Construction  of  such  a  project 
would directly address Afghanistan’s need for 
power,  and  might  also  help  to 
lay  the 
groundwork  for  an  eventual  natural  gas 
pipeline.

Pakistan, 

During  the  mid-1990s,  Unocal  had  pursued  a 
possible 
from 
Turkmenistan's Dauletabad-Donmez gas basin 
via  Afghanistan  to  Pakistan,  but  withdrew 
after  1998.  The  Afghan  government      has 
recently  tried  to  revive  the  Trans-Afghan 
Pipeline  (TAP)  plan,  and  has  held  talks  on 
these  matters  with 
and 
Turkmenistan. Little progress appears to have 
been made. The President has stated his belief 
that  the  project  could  generate  $100-$300 
million per year in transit fees for Afghanistan, 
in  the 
while  creating  thousands  of 
country.  Given  the  obstacles  to  development 
of a natural gas pipeline across Afghanistan, it 
seems  unlikely  that  such  an  idea  will  make 
any  progress  until  the  security  position  is 
resolved. The estimated cost of the pipeline is 
$2.5-$3.5  billion  which  represents  a  further 
obstacle to its implementation.

CASA-1000  and  Proposed  Power  Levels.  
CASA-1000 is a proposed transmission system 
to 
transmit  1,000  Megawatts  of  surplus 
electricity  from  Tajikistan  and  the  Kyrgyz 
Republic  to  Pakistan,  with  power  transiting 
through  and  energy  deliveries  happening 
within  Afghanistan.    If  it  goes  forward,  it 
would  start  operations  circa  2011.    Kabul 
initially 
would  have  a  substation,  which 
would  receive  approximately  100  MW  going 
up to about 300  MW by  2016. Over  the  life  of 
the  project  about  90%  of  the  power  would  be 
used  by  Pakistan  while,  10%  would  be  taken 
by Afghanistan.   

With  562  km  of  HTDC 
transmission, 
Afghanistan  has  the  largest  share  of  CASA 
1000  transmission  lines,  representing  about 
52.1%  of  the  total  project  costs. 
  Total 
estimated project costs are $545.6 mil of which

$59.8  mil  and  begin  receiving  dividends 
following  a  grace  period.    Current  analysis 
indicates  a  return  of  16%  on  equity  by  year 
2033.  In  addition,  Afghanistan  would  begin

Dehsabz 

Guiding the energy strategy for Dehsabz is the 
Trias  Energetica  concept  comprising  three 
pillars:  Reduce  energy  demand  to  the  lowest 
rate  possible;  supply  the  energy  that 
is 
required  from  sustainable  resources;  and, 
where  fossil  energy  is  required,  use  it  as 
efficiently  as  possible.  Although  Afghanistan 
has  one  of  the  lowest  per  capita  energy 
consumption  rates  in  the  world,  that  rate  is 
expected  to  increase  to  a  level  comparable  to 
that of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan over the 
next 30 years. Energy demand will increase as 
the  city  grows,  so  the  energy  supply  must 
keep  pace  with  the  anticipated  demand  if 
project  momentum  is  to  be  achieved  and 
maintained.  Consequently  energy  generation 
and  distribution 
infrastructure  will  be  a 
priority in each construction phase.

making  them  vulnerable  to  environmental

INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS 

Responsibility  for  energy  is  complicated;  at 
present,  four  ministries  have  portfolios  that 
include  direct  engagement  with  the  energy 
sector and its development in Afghanistan:

DONOR PROGRAMS AND 
PROJECTS23 

While  there  are  many  donors  involved  in  all 
aspects  of  energy  production,  the  largest  are 
the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, 
Germany, India and the US.  The Table below 
is a summary of the donor participation in the 
electric power sector according to Afghanistan 
Energy  Information  Center  (AEIC)  as  of  mid-
2006. Additionally the ADB is involved in the 
gas field rehabilitation at Sheberghan and WB 
is  supporting  coal  mine  feasibility  study.  The 
WB has also sponsored studies of distribution 
systems  for  major  load  centers  in  the  north 
and has planned similar work in the southern 
cities  of  Kandahar  and  Lashkar  Gah  once  the 
security  situation  there  has  stabilized.  Also  as 
indicated in the Table, the donors are active in 
both actual infrastructure projects as well as in 
institutional and capacity building efforts.

At  present,  about  650  villages  are  supplied 
with  electricity 
(PV), 
through  a  program  funded  by  the  National 
Solidarity  Program  (NSP)  and  under  the 
auspices  of  MRRD.  The  NSP  is  a  nationwide 
community-driven  development  program  run 
by  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Reconstruction  and 
Development (MRRD) and funded by various 
bilateral  and  multilateral  donors,  primarily 
through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust 
Fund  (ARTF).  NSP  is  supported  by  non-
government (NGO) partners that facilitate the 
election of Community Development Councils 
(CDCs)  and  help  the  councils  to  identify 
community  development  projects.  NGOs  are 
contracted  as  facilitating  partners  to  assist 
communities  in  the  technical  and  financial 
implementation  of  projects  that  for  energy 
have  include  micro-hydro  and  diesel  power 
installations.  NSP’s  partners  have  identified 
over  3000  rural  energy  projects.    NSP  has 
funded around 1700 diesel generators and 500 
micro hydro plants.   

Other  donors  (e.g.,  Government  of  India)  and 
NGOs  (e.g.,  Norwegian  Church  Aide)  are 
active  in  this  area.  The  private  sector  also  is 
encouraged  to  participate  and  invest  in  rural 
electrification  and  deployment  of  energy 
efficiency  and  renewable  energy  technologies. 
Although,  NGOs  and  donors  provide  much 
assistance,  there  appears  to  be  no  clear  IROA 
policy for rural electrification or for promoting 
private  sector  participation  in  rural  energy 
projects;  also  coordination  among  ministries 
and 
other  project  participants'  needs

THE ROLE OF THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR 

Throughout  the  world,  the  role  of  the  private 
sector  in  energy  is  growing  and  is  significant 
in  most  countries. 
  In  Afghanistan,  it  is 
virtually nonexistent.  The roles of the private 
sector  vary 
from  managing  government 
owned  assets  to  outright  ownership  and 
operation. There are examples where all these 

mechanisms coexist in one country.  There are 
other  examples  where  countries  have  chosen 
one  model  and  others  where  the  country 
transitions over time from the simplest model 
(management contract) to complete ownership 
and operation. 

there  are  obstacles 
in 
To  be  sure, 
Afghanistan 
to  greater  private  sector 
involvement, primarily to investment, but 
some  of  these  obstacles  can  be  overcome 
or  offset  with  innovative  mechanisms.  
The  private  sector  can  be  called  upon  to 
invest  and/or  own 
manage,  operate, 
energy  entities  and  operations. 
  Each 
different  mechanism  has  its  advantages 
and  disadvantages.    Often,  there  is  a 
progression  from  management  through 
ownership  that  takes  into  account  the 
current  situation.    In  the  electricity  sub-
sector  for  example,  it  is  highly  unlikely 
under the current security, institutional, policy 
and  legal/regulatory  situation  that  private 
investors will be attracted to invest in a large-
scale  power  plant.    However,  until  these 
issues  are  resolved,  there  are  many  other 
ways to use the private sector.  Billing can 
be  outsourced.  The  construction  arms  of 
DABM could be sold off, allowing DABM 
to  focus  on  core  operations.    Following 
DABM’s  commercialization,  distribution 
could be given on a management contract.  
Individual  power  plants  could  be  given 
on  management  contract.    There  are  a 
variety  of  mechanisms  available  now  for 
the  IROA  to  tap  the  private  sector  as  it 
prepares  the  enabling  frameworks  and 
other  requisite  mechanisms  to  foster  full 
private sector ownership and operation.  

One of the questions that have been posed 
in  this  strategy  exercise  is  whether  or  not 
DABM 
(and  other  SOEs)  should  be 
unbundled.    In  this  context,  unbundling 
has meant the separation of the utility into 
different

In  fact,  many  of  the  earlier  proponents  of 
unbundling  have  now  taken  a  more 
conservative  position  that  the  virtues  of 
unbundling  depend  upon  numerous 
factors such as the size  of the market, the

CHALLENGES, RISKS AND 
CONSTRAINTS 

A number of challenges, constraints and risks, 
both  real  and  perceived,  associated  with  the 
ability of the IROA to develop and implement 
a  comprehensive  Energy  Sector  Strategy  need 
to be addressed.  These include the following. 

A. 

Private Sector Provision 

The  single  most  important  challenge  facing 
energy  is  attracting  the  private  sector  in  a 
meaningful  way.    The  sector  is  plagued  by 
inefficiency  and  under  investment.    While 
second best measures can be put in place, such 
as 
the 
the  commercialization  of  DABM, 
optimal  solution  is  eventual  private  sector 
provision throughout the sector. Private sector 
participation in Afghanistan’s energy sector is 
crucial to achieving the long term objectives of 
the sector. Efforts to attract private investment 
are  incorporated  within  IROA  programs  and 
projects, but there is no coordinated approach 
to  achieving  this  goal.  In  particular,  options 
for  private  participation  beyond  equipment 
and  supplies  and management  contracts  need 
to  be  explored,  and  effective  policies  put  into 
place.  The  IROA  and  donors,  through  the 
“one-stop shop” at the MEW, the Afghanistan 
Investment 
Support  Agency,  or  other 
mechanisms  need  to  address  this  issue  and

Perhaps  the  single  biggest  constraint  in  the 
sector  is  the  very  limited  capacity  given  the

A  lot  of  resources  have  gone  into  capacity 
building  and  the  concern  is  how  to  make 
delivery  more  effective. 
  First,  general 
management,  finance  and  accounting  training 
are  needed  and  this  can  take  place  as  part  of 
larger 
training  programs  not  specifically 
focused on the energy sector, second, training 
efforts  at  the  Ministries  and  SOE’s  need  to  be 
elevated.    Third,  for  technical  training,  it  is 
recommended  to  use  developing  country 
training venues, for example, in India there are 
the  National Thermal  Power  Corporation  and 
IREDA;  ICIMOD  in  Nepal;  TNB  in  Malaysia 
and 
the  Egyptian  Electricity  Holding 
Company  in  Cairo.    In  petroleum,  there  are

B. 

Information and Planning 

As  mentioned  in  several  places  in  this  report, 
the lack of information severely hampers both 
analysis  of  current  and  historical  information 
and  planning.    While  the  IROA  and  Donor 
strategy  has  out  of  necessity  focused  on 
immediate  needs,  the  long  run  health  of  the 
sector  and  the  economy  depend  critically  on 
the collection, dissemination and evaluation of 
energy information and its use in planning. 

C. 

Efficiency 

The  second  most  important  challenge  facing 
the  energy  sector  is  the  efficient  operation  of 
SOEs  and  heavy  reliance  on  subsidies  to 
support  these  SOEs.    Focus  has  been  on 
expanding  supply  and  major  rehabilitation  of 
generation  and  NEPS.    The  two  principal 

constraints  here  are  (1)  the  lack  of  complete 
and  effective  commercialization  of  SOEs  such 
as  DABM  and  (2)  lack  of  priority  given  to 
funding these efforts. This is also the result of 
insufficient capacity. 

D. 

Fuel 

The  cost  of  fuel  to  support  electricity 
generation,  especially  for  Kabul  and  until 
NEPS  is  completed,  will  be  about  $100 
million/year 
$25 
million/year 
for  SEPS.  Funding  and 
procurement  mechanisms  to  obtain  this 
fuel are not yet established and need to be 
addressed.

E. 

Imports 

Prices  and  availability  of  power  from  other 
CAR  countries  also  are  uncertain.  Imported 
power  costs  will  probably  be  as  much,  if  not 
more,  than  4  cents/kWh  or  more  in  2010

F. 

Cost Recovery 

The  average  cost  of  power  to  residential 
customers  currently  is  about  3.8  Afs/kWh. 
However  to  cover  costs  of  supply,  it  would 
need to increase to 7 Afs/kWh or more24. The 
IROA‘s  goal  is  to  raise  tariffs  to  cover  75%  of 
DABM’s  costs,  thus  rising  to  at  least  5.3 
Afs/kWh  or  28%  by  2010.  This  will  place  a 
significant  burden  on  households 
and 
represents a political risk for the Government,

long-term 
commitment  of  resources,  both  financial  and 
institutional  and  a  coordinated  approach  to 
addressing  this  issue  through  regional  and 
local  organizations.  Moreover,  an  evaluation 
and prioritization of rural energy resource and 
delivery  options  is  needed  to  ensure  the 
effectiveness  of  programs  and  projects,  and  a 
comprehensive  monitoring  and  evaluation 
process is needed. The GOA, with the support 
of donors needs to review, evaluate and revise 
its  rural  energy  programs 
to  effectively 
address these needs. 

The  biggest  challenge  in  addressing  effective 
rural  energy  needs  will  be  to  find  innovative 
ways  to  couple  energy  service  delivery  with 

economic  activities.    Constraints  are  the  low 
levels  of  income  and  lack  of  access  to  micro 
credit  and  the  political  inertia  of  providing 
rural,  grid  based  electricity.    Added  to  this  is 
the  need  to  rationalize  rural  electrification 
between  MEW  and  MRRD  so  that  each  can 
best  address  the  problems  with  their  specific 
resources. 

Additionally,  as  households  transition  from 
biomass to other fuels for cooking, heating and 
lighting,  efforts  need  to  be  made  to  consider 
the  differential  impacts  and  uses  between 
women,  children and men.  These differences

power and energy use  

There  is  a  time  in  Afghanistan’s  future  when 
energy  will  be  abundant,  blackouts  will  be  a 
thing of the past, and most of its energy needs 
will be provided directly by the private sector.  
Private  investors  will  develop  power  plants, 
operate  and  own  distribution  systems  and 
develop  in  situ  resources,  just  as  they  have 
begun to do in many countries.  But that is the 
distant  future.    For  now,  Afghanistan  must 
work  hard  to  increase  energy  production, 
doing  so  efficiently  and  in  a  cost  effective 
manner.    It  can  do  this  by  building  new 
capacity  and  by  improving  the  efficiency  of 
existing infrastructure, building capacity in its 
workforce,  and 
its  energy 
operations  to  make  them  more  transparent, 
increase  operating  efficiency  and  prepare 
them for eventual entry into the private sector.  
At the same time though, it must begin laying 
the  ground-work  for  the  eventual  large-scale 
participation of the private sector.  

reorganizing 

Above all, this means that development of the 
electricity  sector  and  the  fuels  that  feed  it  are 
the  single  most  important  priority  in  the 
energy sector! 

India, a country with far greater security, more 
resources, a larger and better trained technical 
established 
cadre  and  a  much  better 
framework 
commercial 
for  energy  and 
ventures, began serious embarking on IPPs in 
1992.  The first IPP, a gas combined cycle by a 
local  company,  was  commissioned  in  late 
1996.    Many  foreign  IPP  developers  such  as 
Enron, Congentrix and AES all started the IPP 
process  but  only  a  handful  finished.    The 
bottom line is that today, 15 years after the IPP 
is  still 
program  started,  most  generation 
Government owned and most IPPs are Indian 
owned  and  financed.    Afghanistan  can  learn 
from  India’s  mistake  and  their  success  but 
can’t  expect  to  have  large  IPP  projects  in  less 
time than they did.  This is not to say that we 
can’t 
sector 
and  won’t  have  private 
involvement;  we  must  and  we  will.    And  the 
time  to  begin  preparing  for  the  private  sector 
is now. 

Afghanistan  must  not  only  focus  on  the 
immediate  energy  needs  but  turn  attention  to 
the longer run.  It knows where it is going and 
but  not  necessarily  how  to  get  there.    This 
strategy  will  address  the  questions  of  where 
we are going and how we get there. What this 
means  for  energy  is  that  as  we  continue  to 
focus  our  efforts  on  short  run  options  to 
increase  supply25,  one  must  begin  developing 
the  foundation  that  will  support  long  run 
sustainable  growth.    It  means  stemming  the 
losses  at SOEs  like DABM,  reorganizing them 
and commercializing them.  It means investing

Integrated  energy  planning  and  policy 
development  are  key  to  a  well  functioning 
energy  sector.    But  the  IROA  is  not  yet 
equipped  to  develop  an  integrated  strategy,

and the procurement of spares.  It will involve 
changes  in  the  operations  of  energy  sector 
SOEs.  The most important of these is DABM. 
Commercialization  of  DABM  must  be  fast 
tracked. It must operate on a commercial basis 
with  clear  targets  for  loss  reduction  and 
officers  and  employees  need  to  be  rewarded 
for increasing efficiency and cutting losses and 
held accountable for performance.  Aside from 
the  financial  implication  of  continued  losses, 
there  are  other  sound  reasons  for  focusing  on 
this  area.    Adding  a  megawatt  of  power 
through  repair  and  renovation  is  usually 
quicker  and  certainly  cheaper  than  building 
new  capacity.    Progress  is  being  made  on 
building  new  capacity  but 
repair  and 
renovation  is  slower  than  it  should  be.    For 
example,  it  is  only  now,  in  September  2007, 
that  DABM  has  begun  a  limited  campaign  to 
identify  losses.  Training  is  urgently  required 
in  all  areas  from  general  accounting  to 
advanced  power  system  controls.  he  second 
prong must  be  to  significantly  improve  sector 
governance  and  begin  involving  the  private 
sector  in  various  aspects  of  energy  until  the 
legal,  commercial  and  security  climate  is 
conducive  to  transfer  most  aspects  of  the 
energy  sector  to  the  private  sector27.    The 
single  most  important  governance  measure 
will  be  the  establishment  of  a  multi-sector 
regulator  under  the  Ministry  of  Economy.

Rural Energy in the Vision 

mpirical  evidence  from  the  developing 
world  clearly  indicates  that  household's 
transition  to  different  forms  of  energy 
based  on  complex  economic,  cultural, 
technical  and  social  relationships.    People 
do  not  just  go  from  cooking  on  firewood 
to  cooking  on  electricity.    Additionally,  if 
they  used  a  certain  amount  of  lumens  or 
btus in, for example, lighting, they do not 
use  the  same  amount  when  moving  up 
from candles to kerosene or from kerosene 
to electricity.   

The  findings  discussed  earlier  lead  to  several 
that  have  profound 
conclusions

implications for rural energy.

First,  given  these  income  levels,  some

electricity  services  will  need

households  were  putting  all  their  energy 
expenditures  into  electricity,  this  would 
mean  consumption  of  13.5  kWh  per 
month or enough to run two 60 W electric 
light bulbs for about 4 hours per day.    

Second,  residential  energy  use  will  be 
very  limited  and  there  is  a  definite 
transitioning  in  energy  use  that  takes 
place.    The  order  of  use  will  most  likely 
be  lighting,  radio,  fan,  TV,  and  then  an 
iron  or  some  other  small  appliance.    It 
will be a long time before electricity takes 
on  uses  for  cooking  and  heating  in  rural 
areas. This means that, until incomes rise 
significantly,  only  a  small  portion  of 
energy  expenditures  will  be  directed  to 
electricity.    Rural  residential  consumers 
will  consume  very  small  amounts  of

Third,  another  problem  exists  because  of 
low income levels and imperfect markets.  
Even if  consumers  were  willing  and able 
to  afford  the  full  cost  electricity  per 
kilowatt  hour,  they  certainly  could  not 
afford the connection costs.  This is called 
the first cost problem.  For example, it has 
been 
cost  of 
purchasing  a  small  solar  home  system 
(SHS)  would  be  61%  of  a  typical  rural 
Pakistani household’s annual income.  In 
essence,  it  means  that  even  if  consumers 
would  benefit  or  save  money  by  paying 
their  monthly  electricity  bill,  they  could 
not  afford  the  “first  cost”  of  adopting  a 
more  electricity  intensive  consumption 
pattern.    With  rural  Afghanis  spending 
the  bulk  of  their  income  on  food,  they 
would  be  unable  without  some  form  of 
subsidy  to  purchase  a  SHS.  This  leads 
many  countries  to  subsidize  connection 
costs  even  if  they  do  not  subsidize 
consumption or to provide other forms of 
concessional financing. 

Fourth,  even  when  the  first  cost  problem 
is  overcome,  the  low  population  density 
coupled  with  the  low  income  and  low 
demand,  will  mean  that  either:  (a)  the 
consumption will need to be met by small 
modular units like solar; or (b) that a base 
load needs to be identified and developed 
such as a school or clinic or a larger scale 
economic  use 
such  as  milling  or 
irrigation. 

Fifth,  where  incomes  and  consumption 
are  unlikely  to  support  electricity,  then 
rural electrification may need to focus on 
finding  or  creating  a  customer  that  can 
act  as  the  base  load  as  well  as  subsidize 
the  other  users28.    Then,  productive  uses 
of  electricity 
that  will  reduce  costs, 
increase  incomes  or  both.    This  must  be 
rural

electrification  activities.    It  also  means 
that  this  productive  use  will  subsidize 
other  consumers.    Productive  use  here 

cornerstone 

for  most 

can  be  defined  as  either 
income 
generating  activities  such  as  milling  or 
irrigation or end use in clinics or schools.  

 There  is  an  important  difference  between 
these two types of productive uses.  In the first 
case,  the  productive  uses  are  those  that  have 
economic  impacts  in  the  near  term  and  those 
act to increase consumption and ability to pay 
because  the  demand  for  electricity  grows  as 
income  increases.  This  first  case impacts  rural 
electrification  in  two  ways.    First,  it  acts  as  a 
base  load  with  the  consequent  reductions  in 
the cost of supply.  Second, in the near term it 
increases  economic  activity  in  the  area  and 
increases demand due to the positive spillover 
effects.  In the second case, those that consume 
education  and  health  services  will  see  an 
economic impact but it is usually in the distant 
future.    The  second  use  can  benefit  rural 
electrification  by  acting  as  a  base  load  and 
reducing  costs  in  that  manner.    All  of  this 
leads  to  some  important  implications  for  the 
third prong of the energy strategy.  One, focus

28 This subsidization can be indirect in that the increase 
consumption  allows  economies  of  scale  in  supply  and 
lower  costs.    For  example,  the  project  sponsor  identifies 
the use of electricity for a grain mill and then uses mini 
hydro instead of solar.  This will result in lower costs of 
production for all users.  The subsidization can be direct 
when  the  base  load  use  pays  more  than  its  marginal 
supply  costs,  thereby  lowering  the  amount  needed  to  be 
covered from other users.   

The overall policy framework for the sector is:  

1.  Restructured  energy  sector  governance 

and commercialized operations  

2.  Rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  Afghan

larger  programs  – 

Renewable Energy. There is not a coordinated 
approach in place to support the development 
of  renewable  energy  sources.  A  number  of 
small renewable projects are underway, many 
are  affiliates  of 
i.e., 
alternative 
in  poppy 
livelihood  programs 
growing  regions.  Use  of  solar  water  heating 
and lighting, water pumping and micro-hydro 
can  be  expanded  and  privately  operated.  In 
rural  locations,  communities  have  gathered 
resources to construct small hydro and limited 
solar  facilities  that  support  minimal  but 
important light and small power supply. More 
emphasis required. 

NEEDS ASSESSMENT 

Several  needs  assessments  have  been  carried 
out.  They fall into two broad categories.  The 
first  category  projects  demand  and  supply  or 
given  an  assumption  about  economic  growth, 
investigates  how  demand  and  supply  will 
respond.    The  second  category  is  prescriptive 
in  nature  that  is  it  is  based  upon  some  policy 
variables and sets targets about how the sector 
should respond.  For example, it sets a rate of 
household  connections  as  a  target  and  then 
uses  Government  policies  and  control  of  the 
sector  to  move  towards  that  target.    Each  of 
these is useful but one major drawback is that 
ALL have been at the sub-sector level.  “These 
studies  have  primarily  focused  on  individual

energy  sub-sectors  such  as  power  or  oil  and 
gas,  in  some  specific  instances  illuminating 
important aspects of the strategic development 
of  the  energy  sector  in  the  overall  context  of 
Afghanistan’s  development  agenda.    At  the 
same  time,  the  sub-sector-based  approach, 
while  necessary  to  adequately  address  the 
technical complexities of the energy sector, has 
not captured the inter-related nature of energy 
and, 
sector 
consequently,  the  trade-offs  that  may  be 
entailed 
the  strategic  decision-making 
process.”29    This  is  a  consequence  of  the 
fragmenting  of  energy  across  institutions  and 
the 
integrated 
planning  policies  and  procedures.    In  reality, 
no energy sub-sector can stand on its own but 
is  highly  dependent  upon  what  transpires  in 
the other sub-sectors.  For example, a forecast 
of  the  demand  and  supply  of  hydrocarbons 
that does not at the least consider the demand 
and supply of electricity, a major consumer of 
hydrocarbons,  will  surely  miss  the  mark.  
While  as  an  academic  exercise  this  may  have 
little consequence, nothing can be further from 
reality  when  scarce  human,  institutional  and 
financial resources are required to develop an 
optimal  mix.    In  short,  the  failure  to  forecast 
and  analyze  on  an  integrated  sectoral  basis 
means  suboptimal 
investment  plans  and 
operating  conditions,  and  a  lower  rate  of 
economic  growth  than  would  otherwise  have 
happened.    Thus,  an  Overall  Energy  Sector 
Needs  Assessment  does  not  exist  and  at  this 
will  be  simply  an  aggregate  of  the  individual 
sub-sector needs assessments. 

ELECTRICITY 

The  Afghanistan  Compact  developed  at  the 
London  Conference  in  Jan-Feb  2006  defined 
energy benchmarks for Afghanistan: 

“By end-2010: electricity will reach at least 65% of 
households and 90% of nonresidential 
establishments in major urban areas and at least 
25% of households in rural areas; at least 75% of 
the costs will be recovered from users connected 
to the national power grid. A strategy for the 
development and use of renewable energies will 
be developed by end-2007.”

The  estimated  cost  of  increasing  customer

the  cost  of 
expanding  generating  supplies  (domestic  and 
imported) 
is  approximately  $400  million.  
Therefore, on this basis the funding needed to 
meet  Afghanistan  Compact  goals  would  be 
about  $1.2  billion  for  the  period  2006-201030, 
excluding  the  costs  of  developing  the  energy

tariffs.  However,  data  on  the  number  of 
households  in  Afghanistan,  on  their  income 
and  consumption  patterns  and  overall  energy 
demand generally is not available or is of very 
poor  quality.  The  same  situation  exists  for 
non-residential  establishments;  for  the  cost  of

improving  revenue  collection  in  order  to

PRIORITY POLICIES AND 
OBJECTIVES 

Following  from  the  broad  objectives  above 
and  using  the  four  prong  strategy  approach, 
priority policies to support implementation of 
the Sector Vision have been put forward. This 

section    provide  more  detail  on  elements  for 
an  Afghanistan  Energy  Sector  Strategy, 
including  those  that  address  overall  energy 
sector  needs  (e.g.,  prioritizing  projects  based 
on  a  cost-benefit  analysis)  as  well  as  sector-
specific  elements  (e.g.,  electricity  tariff  reform 
and  completion  of  the  Sheberghan  gas  field 
development). The intent is for this Strategy to 
provide  overall  guidance  on  achieving 
Afghanistan’s  energy  sector  goals  in  a  timely 
and  cost-effective  manner  and  to  address  five 
primary areas: 

Adopt policy that:

to  be  improved.  Specific  attention  needs 
to  be  paid  to  these  issues  within  the  ICE 
to  ensure  that  ANDS  goals  are  met 
efficiently and on time. 

Reduce  Subsidies  and  cross-subsidies  in 
both power and fuel.  This will be done so 
in  a  way  that  matches  improvements  in 
the  sector  and  recognizes  the  hardships 
that  quick  withdrawal  of  the  subsidy 
could  have.  Universal  service  obligations 
should  be  directly 
through 
Government payments to the utility. 

funded 

Subsidies are an important and integral tool of 
Government  policy.  Energy  subsidies  that 
provide a  basic level of energy  services  to  the 
poor  exist  in  almost  every  country.    So  the 
issue it not whether there should be subsidies 
but  rather  who  gets  the  subsidy  and  the  how 
the  subsidy  is  provided.  Subsidies  need  to  be 
identified  and  made  transparent  during  the 
restructuring process and removed. 

In  2004/05,  the  average  tariff  collected  by 
DABM was only five cents/kWh, compared to 
an  average  unit  cost  of  power  production  of 
about  12  cents/kWh. 
  Currently,  power 
subsidies  cost  the  government  $56  M/year, 
which is unsustainable and undesirable. 

Assistance  is  required  to  review  the  existing 
tariffs  and  develop  a  targeted  subsidy  plan 
and  a  phase-in  plan  for  subsidy  reduction.  
Assistance  will  need  to  include  a  public 
outreach  program.    This  could  be  one  of  the 
first tasks of the regulator (See below).

ENERGY SUB-SECTOR STRATEGIES 

ELECTRIC POWER 

The goal of the IROA ‘s strategy for the power 
sector  is  to  provide  supplies  of  reliable, 
affordable  electric power  sufficient  to  support 
a  growth  rate  in  GDP  of  9%  per  year  and 
reduce poverty by 3% per year. If these targets 
are  met,  by  2013  these  achievements  would 
result  in  over  90%  of  residents  in  the  three 
major cities and more than 50% of the rural  

an 

extremely 

population  having  electricity.  However  this 
remains 
ambitious 
goal.Hydropower  holds  the  greatest  promise 
for  Afghanistan  followed  by  natural  gas  and 
coal.  Utilization  of  indigenous  fossil  fuels 
(natural gas and coal) for power generation is 
very limited as is utilization of solar, wind and 
other renewable energy resources.  

Figure  9. 

Cost of Power Under MEW Strategy 

Source: Ministry of Energy and Water. 

Figure  9  shows  that  the  cost  of  delivered 
power  can  be  significantly  reduced  through 
efforts  by  the  IROA  and  MEW  to  displace 
costly diesel power with other sources, such as 
natural-gas  and  coal  and  with  lower  cost 
power  imports.  Most  of  the  cost  of  power  is 
associated  with  generation  (as  opposed  to 
transmission  and  distribution),  so  replacing 
costly  diesel  generation  will  have  a  major 
impact  on 
the  delivered  cost  of  power

Regulation by contract does not specify prices. 
It  pre-specifies  a  regulatory  treatment  for 
individual cost elements, which taken together 
determine  the  prices  charged  for  electric 
service. The contract is a detailed tariff-setting 
agreement  between  the  service  provider  and 
the  regulator  that  forces  the  regulator  to  set 
tariffs  based  on  a  set  of  specific  formulas  and 
procedures. In this way it limits the discretion

and  non-controllable 

The  agreement  or  contract  contains  a  formula 
with  pre-specified  parameters  that  determine 
how  annual  total  revenue  or  average  tariffs 
levels will be established by the regulator. The 
formulas  generally  distinguish  between 
controllable 
costs. 
Controllable  costs  are  tied  to  external  indexes 
or  benchmarks  with  performance  targets  and 
associated 
rewards  or  penalties.  Non-
controllable  costs  are  allowed  to  be  passed 
through to customers on a regular basis. There 
also  is  usually  a  mechanism  to  deal  with 
unforeseen  events,  such  as  natural  disaster 
that  might  affect  the  company’s  costs  or 
revenues and a dispute resolution mechanism 
to  address  disagreements  between 
the 
company and the regulator.

Plans  are  underway  to  rehabilitate  the  gas 
fields  to  expand  production  and  to  upgrade 
the existing gas pipeline network to supply the 
fertilizer plant and the local market. Activities 
to  promote  exploration  and  development  of 
additional  gas  resources  have  been  underway 
for some time. 

Data  on  gas  reserves  indicate  that  there  is 
sufficient  low-cost  gas  reserves  available  to 
operate  a  100  MW  combined  cycle  turbine 
plant  at  Sheberghan  for  25  years  and  that  the 
cost per kWh of power generated would be in 
the  2.8  to  3.5  cent  range.  Also,  gas  fired

less

Ministry of Mines has drafted and proposed a 
series  of 
the 
hydrocarbons  law  with  the  purpose  to  better 
accelerate the gas sector development process. 
The  Afghan-Tajik  and  Amu  river  zones  were 
blocked  ,  and  work  has  been  running  in 
provision  of  tender  documents  for  attraction 
of private sector investment and it is due  that 
in  2008  MoM  would  lease  two  gas  fields  and 
one  oil  filed  through  biddings  to  private 
sector.  

Based on the existing reports, 120 cubic meters 
of gas reserves and approximately 14,5 million 
tons  of  petroleum 
reserves  have  been 
identified. However in accordance with recent 
evaluations,  the  size  of  gas/coals  reported  to 
have been more than the above estimation. As 
based on the US geological survey , 444 billion 
cubic natural gas reserves, 219 million tons oil 
and  75  million  tons  kandansat  have  been 
identified in latest investigations. 

In  addition  to  proven  reserves,  there  exist 
numerous  un-drilled  prospective  structures 
that  have  undergone  various  stages  of 
exploration.  If  even  a  small  number  of  these 
un-drilled  structures  contained  commercial

It is possible that some of these structures 
may  have  no  hydrocarbons  or  only 
marginal accumulations. Only by drilling 
and testing the wells can this information 
be confirmed.  

It  is  likely  that  many  of  these  reserves

50  million  US  dollar  in  a  year.Unless  new

In  addition,  current  gas  prices  are  too  low  to 
cover  costs  of  rehabilitation,  O&M  and

Since  currently  the  gasification  system  is  full 
of  technical  defects,  it  causes  problems  in 
collecting  the  exact  revenues.  The  tariffs 
should be arranged in a way to cover the real 
cost  and

delivery,  distribution  and  sale  of  natural  gas 
has  been  running  by  Afghan  gas  enterprise

Coal 

Afghanistan  has  reasonably  good  quality  coal 
resources that exceeds almost 2 ml tons and is 
estimated  to  have  significant  coal  reserves 
(probable  reserves  estimated  at  about  400 
million tons), most of which are located in the 
northern  part  of  the  country  in  the  region 
between  Herat  and  Badakhshan53.  Although 
Afghanistan produced over 100,000 short tons 
of coal annually as late as the early 1990s, , its 
production  currently  reaches 
to  300.000- 
400.000 tons annually  

The  primary  coal  resources  in  Afghanistan 
occur in the Katawaz Basin south and west of 
Kabul.  Prospective  economically  viable  coal 
deposits are found in five coal districts: Karkar 
dodkash, 
Ishpushta,  Dara-i-Suf,  chal  wa 
namakab  and  sabzake  Herat.  However,  the 
real  extent  of  coal  deposits  in  the  country  is 
not  known  and  there  is  an  urgent  need  for 
exploration and exrtraction.

Some  current  coal  operations  are  taking  place 
at  Karkar  and  Ispushta  mining  districts.  The 
literature  indicates  that  Dara-i-Suf  appears  to 
have  the  greatest  potential  for  significant 
reserves,  already  estimated  to  be  over  84 
million  tons.  This  coal  is  believed  to  be  of 
coking grade with a high calorific value in the 
range  of  7,000  kilo-calories/kg.  The  mines  at 
Kalich  in  the  Ispushta  district  are  active.  Coal 
in  these  districts  is  extracted  by  either  crude, 
inefficient, mechanized mining methods or by 
“artesian”  methods.  Current  production  from 
all operations is estimated to be about 110,000 
short tons.

Recommendations:  As  part  of  Afghanistan’s 
Energy  Sector  Strategy,  the  IROA  needs  to 
undertake the following programs: 

1. 

Providing proper condition  for 
private  sector  development  of  coal  resources 
and  associated  power  plants.  This  would 
include 
issuing  a  Reconnaissance  Permit, 
Prospecting License and Development License 
as  discussed  above,  with  specific  deadlines 
incentives  to  develop  resources  and 
and 
associated infrastructure. 

2. 

Provision  and  completion  of 
functioning  mine  rules  according  to  law  orders 
of  mining  materials  to  clarify  ownership  and 
development  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the 
IROA and the private sector in this respect. 

RURAL AND RENEWABLE 
ENERGY 

Due  to  the  dispersed  nature  of  the  rural 
population,  renewable  energy  offers  the  best 
solution  for  electrification  for  the  majority  of 
Afghanistan’s  rural  population  that  currently 
does  not  have  access  to  electricity  and  has  no 
real expectation of connection to the grid55. 

Most  of  Afghanistan’s  25  million  people  have 
no  access  to  modern  forms  of  energy.  Fuel 
wood  accounts  for  an  estimated  75%  of  total 
rural  energy  supplies.  This  is  having  an 
adverse  impact  on  forests  and  watersheds.  In 
addition,  burning  these  fuels  increases  indoor

health of women and children in particular. 

Extreme  poverty  in  rural  areas  also  is  related 
to  lack  of  income  earning  opportunities.  The 
productive  use  of  electricity  helps  reduce 
poverty  by  providing  alternative  sources  of 
livelihoods  and 
increase  educational  and 
training  opportunities.  The  remoteness  of 
rural  locations  and  the  rough  terrain  make 
expansion  of  the  electricity  grid  into  these 
areas  economically  infeasible.  Therefore,  the

among  ministries 

Development  of  rural  and  renewable  energy 
resources,  including  rural  electrification,  is 
taking  place  in  Afghanistan  without  a  clear 
institutional  or  policy  framework.  There  is  a 
de  facto  split  of  responsibility  for  rural 
electrification 
and 
coordination  between  ministries  and  donor-
funded  programs  needs  improvement.  The 
Government  needs  to  articulate  a  policy  that 
clearly  defines  goals  and  objectives;  clarifies 
the  role  and  expected  scope  of  subsidies;  and 
emphasizes  the  role  of  the  private  sector.  A 
clear,  standardized  procedure  for  assessing 
and evaluating renewable energy resources as 
the  basis  for  supporting  development  of  pilot 
projects  needs  to  be  established.  Various 
methods  of  supporting  rural  energy  projects, 
such  as  community  development  entities, 
rural  cooperatives,  and  franchises,  need  to  be 
evaluated and tested as to their applicability to 
Afghanistan. 

Examples  of  successful  rural  energy  projects 
that  could  be  supported  by  the  IROA  and 
donors include the following:

BARRIERS TO ACCESS 

the  physical  nature  of 

For  Afghanistan,  barriers  to  increasing  access 
to  electric power, particularly  in  rural areas—
in  addition  to  policy  constraints—have  much 
to  do  with 
the 
investments  required,  the  large  scale  of  the 
undertaking,  and  broad  country  issues  (e.g., 
security,  remote  location,  difficult  terrain). 
These  issues  need  to  be  effectively  addressed 
through 
project 
development and implementation.

and 

the  short-term  while 

Solutions  to  these  problems  can  be  found 
through  a  mixture  of  policies  and  programs 
that  continue to rely  on IROA involvement  in 
the  sector  (with  donor  assistance)  particularly 
over 
the  necessary 
framework  is  being  put  into  place.    These 
programs also need to unleash the potential of 
the  domestic  and  international  private  sector 
to  provide  an  expanded  array  of  energy 
services  and  allow  the  withdrawal  over  time 
of  direct  involvement  in  the  sector  by  the 
IROA  and  its  transition  to  an  oversight  and 
regulatory function. 

The  IROA  needs  to  explore  options  for 
achieving this goal and to put in place policies 
and  programs  that  will  remove  barriers  to 
private  participation  in  the  energy  sector. 

IROA  policy 

Examples of supportive policies and programs 
include  “Light  Handed  Regulation  for  Stand 
Alone  Systems”  similar  to  that  currently 
practiced  by  the  Omary  Electric  Company. 
However,  to  be  effective this  needs  to  be  part

of  an  official 
electrification.  The  policy  would  allow  self-
contained  power  systems  in  rural  or  urban 
areas to be “self-regulating” in terms of setting 
service  quality,  pricing,  connection  and 
disconnection  standards,  billing,  etc.  and 
would  apply  to  cooperative  or  private  sector 
providers. Basic licensing, safety and technical 
standards would be applied by the GOA.

The  need  for  small-scale,  site  specific

for Rural Energy Development. As noted under 
the Electricity Sector section, responsibility for 
all  rural-remote  energy  efforts  should  be 
consolidated  within  one  institution,  RLED, 
with  membership  by  all  stakeholders  to  help 
coordinate  rural-remote energy  programs  and 
projects.    It  appears  that  the  MRRD  is  the 
proper  entity  to  head  up  this  effort.    Rural 
energy is defined as off grid applications such 
as  SHS,  micro-hydro,  and  diesels  in  areas  of 
less  than  2,500  persons.    It  could  also  include 
the  use  of  wind  power  for  both  electrical  and 
mechanical energy, for example.  It would not 
include  any  grid  connected  applications.  It 
also  includes  rural  electrification.    Since  there 
is  no  universal  definition  of  rural, 
the 
definition for this purpose is something needs 
to work out. REDA would also be responsible 
for  developing  a  rural-remote  energy  master 
plan.  

2. 

In  collaboration  with  NURC, 
develop  Rural  Energy  Policy  to  include  Light 
Handed  Regulation  as  an  official  policy  of  the 
IROA  and  implemented  by  the  MRRD  to 
promote  development  of  stand-alone  rural 
energy systems by cooperatives or the private 
sector. 
  Policy  and  regulation  must  set 
guidelines  for  cost-recovery.    In  essence  all 
project  need  to  be  able  to  recover  operation 
and maintenance costs and set aside a sinking 
fund for capital replacement.  The rural energy 
policy  and  master  plan  will 
investigate 
appropriate fuels for cooking.

Develop  a  Methodology  for

To  achieve  its  goals,  in  addition  to  providing 
for 
energy 
development  the  Energy  Sector  Strategy  will 
incorporate  mechanisms  to  support  cross-
cutting  issues  that  impact  all  energy  sector 
initiatives.  These  include  the  environment, 
counter narcotics, anti-corruption,  gender and 
regional  cooperation—in  addition  to  capacity 
building.  

ENVIRONMENT 

Energy,  even  renewable  energy,  has  an 
environmental  impact.    This  strategy  directly 
addresses environmental impacts by:

environmental  impact. 
  For  example,

Focusing  on  policies  and  projects  that

areas  that  seek  to  reduce  the  amount  of 
energy  needed  for  any  given  activity.    A 
CFL program is one such measure. 

Shifting  investment  and  production  to 
cleaner  sources  of  energy,  for  example, 
wind power.

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

The energy strategy directly tackles corruption 
in  several  ways.    One  of  the  most  important 
measures  for  reducing  corruption  is  limiting 
the  role  or  influence  of  Government.    In 
energy,  we  are  promoting  increased  private 
sector  participation;  we  are  reducing  the  role 
of  Government.    Additionally,  in  SOE’s,  such

oversight. 

REGION COOPERATION 

The  most  important  areas  furthering  regional 
cooperation include expansion of energy trade 
by upgrading electricity transmission ties with 
Central Asian countries and exploring options 
for  transport  of  electricity  and  natural  gas 
through  Afghanistan  for  regional  supply.  The 
NEPS  represents  one  of  the  largest  sector 
investments  and  the  cornerstone  of  success  in 
NEPS  is  expanded  energy  trade.    Technical 
standards and commercial instruments will be 
developed.    Physical  investments  are  being 
made to improve trade.  CASA 1000 is looking 
at  using  Afghanistan  as  an  energy  transit 
corridor. 
  Regional  cooperation  will  be 
enhanced by projects such as NEPS and efforts 
to  increase  cost-effective  electricity  imports 
from neighboring countries. 

GENDER AND POVERTY 
REDUCTION 

Most  energy  interventions  have  the  potential 
to  provide  positive  benefits  for  women  and 
children in particular  and also  for  the  poor  in 
general.  For  example,  women  have  specific 
energy  needs  in  water  pumping,  agriculture 
processing,  security,  work  productivity  and 
health – most often that energy is provided by 
their  own 
that  work 
effort  meaning 
significantly  longer  days  than  men.    More 
efficient  stoves,  drinking  water  pumping  and 
agro-processing 
reduce  women's 
workloads,  improve  their  health,  and  expand 
income-earning potential. 

can 

The energy sector has the potential to provide 
a  wide  pool  of  jobs  as  it  is  developed;  for 
example,  in  the  construction  and  repair  of 
thermal plants, in coal mines, and in oil fields. 
Labor  intensive  construction  methods  should 
be  considered.  For  skilled  technical  jobs,  the 
energy  sector  can

COUNTER NARCOTICS 

The  strategy  does  not  directly  address  this 
issue  but  it  is  clear  that  increased  economic 
growth  supported  by  an  expanded  energy 
sector  particularly  in  rural  and  remote  areas 
will  help  counter  the  cultivation  of  poppies 
and illicit drug trade.  In many programs that 
have  targeted  poppy  areas,  success  has  been 
made  when  alternative  livelihoods  are  found.  
A cornerstone of this strategy is the linking of 
energy supply to income generating activities.  

CAPACITY BUILDING 

Finally, the major emphasis within the Energy 
institutional 
Sector  Strategy  placed  on 
strengthening  and  capacity  building—and  on 
institutional  reform,  such  as  consolidating 
authority  over  rural  electrification  and  rural 
energy  projects  and  separating  policymaking 
in 
from  regulatory  authority—will  result 
fostering  a  professional,  open  environment 
and increase opportunities for participation in 
energy  sector  activities  on  behalf  customers 
and  other  stakeholders.  This,  in  turn  will 
support  achievement  of  the  ANDS  cross-
cutting goals.  The strategy explicitly provides 
for  capacity  building  projects  and  capacity 
building  is  one  of  the  four  pillars  of  the 
strategy. 

Achieving  improvements  in  capacity  building 
requires  a  coordinated  approach.  The  IROA 
has  recently  initiated  the  National  Capacity 
Building  Policy  and  Program  designed  to 
effectively  address  capacity  building  and 
training needs throughout the Government. It 
establishes  an  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  to

efforts  throughout  the  IROA  to  ensure  their

present  there  are  25  donors  engaged  in  the 
sector;  in  addition  there  are  15  different  US 
agencies.  Afghan  counterpart  resources  are 
limited  and  stretched;  donors  need  to  respect 
these limits.

3  Hardware  and  technical  capacity  Virtually 
none of the equipment, supplies or spare parts 
required  to  operate  the  energy  sector  are 
produced  or  even  available  in  the  country. 
When  they  are  on  the  local  market  they  are 
often  of  seriously  technically  inferior  quality 
and  at  very  high  cost.  Some  of  the  larger 
equipment (i.e., diesel generators, drilling rigs) 
can take up to one year to procure or to lease. 
Much  of  the  modern  technology  that  is  being 
installed  to  upgrade  the  power  sector  has 
never  been  part  of  the  system  and  no  staff

MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

Monitoring and Evaluation Reporting System: 

A.1 Overall Reporting, Because of the diversity and breadth of energy  sector operations, it is 
impossible  to  have  one  reporting  system;  different  technical,  financial  and  operational 
reporting is required. Still, there are common reporting requirements and approaches that will 
be followed. 

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

Sector Specific Reporting through Regulatory Bodies. It is expected that the cadastre and 
inspectorate  functions  for  hydrocarbons  and  mining  will  be  operational  by  end  August 
2008.  More  momentum  for  power  regulation  is  required  but  will  also  provide  reporting 
requirements and monitoring standards presently absent from the sector. Liquid fuels will 
also benefit from some external regulation. Ultimately, the establishment of a multi-sector 
regulatory  body  is  possible  (i.e.,  would  regulate  oil,  natural  gas,  coal,  electricity,  liquid 
fuels, renewable) 
ICE.  Through  the  ICE  mechanism  very  definite  reporting  schedules  have  been  instituted 
tracking high-priority projects (i.e., Northeast Power System) as well as identifying project 
funding  and  other  gaps.  This  mechanism  will  continue  to  play  an  important  role  in  how 
energy developments are tracked and monitored by Government. 

A.2  Project-based  reporting,  Because  many  energy  projects  are  donor  funded,  international  standard 
reporting  and  monitoring  mechanisms  are  in  place.  Government  will  abide  by  these  requirements  and 
where possible, adopt them to line ministry and overall sector project developments otherwise funded. 
Fro details refer to Annex II (Monitoring Matrix).
