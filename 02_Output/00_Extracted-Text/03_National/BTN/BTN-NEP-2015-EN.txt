Introduction
BACKGROUND
Under  the  Ninth  Five-year  Plan  (2002–08), 
the  Department  of  Energy  (DoE),  Ministry  of 
Economic  Affairs  (formerly  Ministry  of  Trade 
and  Industry),  undertook  a  study  to  prepare  an 
Integrated  Energy  Management  Master  Plan 
(IEMMP)  for  Bhutan.  This  was  a  Government 
of  India  assisted  study  for  which  The  Energy 
and Resources Institute (TERI), New Delhi, was 
appointed as a consultant. 
both  at  the  rural  and 
levels.  This 
urban 
approach 
integrated 
provides various policy 
options,  in  line  with 
the  current  policies 
and  Vision  2020,  for 
future development of the kingdom. 
  The  overall  objective  of  the  ‘Gross  National 
Happiness’  is  based  on  four  widely  accepted 
sustainable  development  principles,  as 
listed 
below. 
1  Equitable socio-economic development
2  Conservation of the natural environment
3  Promotion of cultural heritage
4  Establishment of good governance
‘Gross National Happiness 
is more important than 
Gross National Product’
His Majesty King Jigme 
Singye Wangchuck, 1972
In  the  ﬁ rst  phase  of  the  study,  Bhutan  Energy 
Data Directory 2005 was published, which covered, 
for the ﬁ rst time, the energy demand and supply 
balance for 2005 and potential of energy resources. 
It  also  reviewed  the  status  of  the  energy  sector, 
including the institutional arrangements. The Data 
Directory  included  the  survey  of  the  residential 
sector and energy audits of major industries. 
  This  report,  second  in  the  series,  analyses  a 
wide  range  of  issues,  which  mainly  relate  to  the 
energy sector of Bhutan. This report presents the 
objectives of the study, approach and methodology, 
future  outlook  of  the  energy  sector  till  2020, 
demand  and  supply  analyses,  impacts  of  energy 
on economy, and interdependence of development 
and energy. Various laws/regulations have also been 
analysed, along with assessment of social impacts 
of supplying energy to rural areas.

Energy sector – an overview
BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON BHUTAN
Bhutan is a landlocked country situated between 
India and China in the fragile eastern Himalayas. 
Its population as per Census 2005 is 634 982. 
  Bhutan covers an area of 38 394 km2, roughly 
spread  140  km  north  to  south  and  275  km  east 
to  west.  The  altitude  varies  from  100  m  above 
the mean sea level (msl) in the southern tropical 
region  to  7550  above  the  msl  in  the  northern 
alpine region. The country is blessed with natural 
forests and is one of the 10 biodiversity hotspots 
notiﬁ ed by the United Nations (UN). The country 
receives  fair  amount  of  rainfall,  varying  from 
500  mm  in  the  north  to  5000  mm  in  the  south. 
Situated  in  high  altitude  Himalayas,  Bhutan  has 
667  glaciers  and  2674  glacier  lakes,1  which  feed 
four  major  rivers  and  their  tributaries,  making 
the  country  rich  in  hydropower  resources. These 
geographical  features,  landlocked  condition,  and 
unique  environment  pose  unique  challenges 
and  opportunities  for  Bhutan  as  it  pursues  the 
development of its economy sector. 
  After  centuries  of  isolation,  Bhutan 
opened  its  economy  in  1950s  and 
started  following  a  path  of  sustainable 
and  cautious  development,  popularly 
known  as 
‘middle  path’  of 
development.  So  far,  it  has  followed 
the  path  of  development  sustainably, 
the 
causing  minimum  damage 
environment and ecology. 
  Planned  development  started 
in 
1961  when  the  ﬁ rst  Five-year  Plan 
was  implemented  with  the  help  of 
the  Government  of  India.  Right  from 
the  ﬁ rst  Five-year  Plan  (1961–66)  till  the  Ninth 
Five-year  Plan  (2002–08),2  the  country  has  seen 
planned  and  steady  economic  development  and 
has gone through substantial transformation.
Indo-Bhutan  bilateral  relationship  plays  an 
important  role  in  the  development  of  Bhutanese 
economy. India and Bhutan have had trade relations 
for  centuries,  and  the  ties  grew  stronger  after 
the  Independence  of  India  in  1947. The  historic 
India–Bhutan Treaty of 1949 laid the foundation 
for Indo-Bhutan relations. The power sector, along 
with the health and education sectors, is among the 
major sectors in which India has made signiﬁ cant 
contributions  in  terms  of  investment,  capacity 
building, and technology transfer. 
 
BHUTAN’S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
The  growth  rate  of  the  gross  domestic  product 
(GDP,  %  per  year)  of  the  country,  from  2003  to 
2008, is presented in Table 1.

ENERGY SECTOR – AN OVERVIEW
DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERISTICS OF 
BHUTAN’S ENERGY SECTOR
Power sector development
Electricity  was  introduced  for  the  ﬁ rst  time  in 
Bhutan in 1964 when the ﬁ rst diesel generator sets 
were installed at Pheuntsholing and Samtse. This 
was followed by the development of hydropower, 
and  the  ﬁ rst  hydropower  plant  with  a  capacity 
of  360  kW  was  commissioned  in  1967  to  supply 
electricity  to  the  capital  town  of Thimphu. The 
power  sector  got  a  boost  in  1988  when  Chukha 
Hydropower Plant with a capacity of 336 MW was 
commissioned. With the commissioning of Chukha 
Hydropower  Plant,  Bhutan  started  exporting 
electricity  to  India,  earnings  of  which  started 
funding  its  socio-economic  development. Today, 
about 45% of its export earnings are through the 
export of electricity, and this earning has also been 
instrumental in the development of infrastructure 
like roads, hospitals, and school, besides providing 
impetus to industrial development.  
  Another  major  milestone 
in  hydropower 
development  was  achieved  in  2007  when  Tala 
Hydropower  Plant  with  a  capacity  of  1020  MW 
was fully commissioned.  
  Bhutan’s economic growth is closely related to 
the  development  of  its  power  sector. The  phased 
commissioning of the Tala Power Project in 2006 
boosted  the  GDP  growth  sharply  in  2007. The 
growth  was  slightly  less  in  2008,  which  was  due 
to high base effect.
Industries are the largest consumer of electricity 
in  the  country.  In  2005,  the  sector  consumed 
419  MU  (65%  of  the  total  consumption)  of 
electricity. 
Institutional and commercial sectors consumed 
118.88 MU (18.76 % of the total consumption) 
of electricity.
The  residential  sector  consumed  89  MU 
of  electricity 
total 
consumption).
The agriculture and transport sectors consume 
negligible amount of electricity.
#
#
#
(14.5%  of 
in  2005 
#
Electricity  constituted  15.7%  of  the  total  energy 
supply in the country during 2005.
  Figure  1  shows  the  electricity  consumption  in 
different Dzongkhags in 2005.
Fuelwood
The  main  source  of  primary  energy  in  Bhutan 
is  fuelwood  obtained  from  forests.  The  country 
consumed  724  597  tonnes  of  fuelwood  during 
2005,  which  accounted  for  56.8%  of  the  total 
primary  energy  supply.  In  addition  to  fuelwood, 
other biomass fuels, which are being used in small 
quantities, include briquettes made from saw dust 
and agriculture residue.
Petroleum fuels
About  19%  of  the  total  energy  is  met  from 
imported  petroleum  fuels 
like  diesel,  petrol, 
kerosene, liqueﬁ ed petroleum gas (LPG), furnace 
oil,  aviation  turbine  fuel,  light  diesel  oil  (LDO), 
and so on. Diesel and petrol feature amongst the 
top imports in the country on import value basis. 
In 2005, 51 460 kilolitres of diesel was imported 
against the import of 13 879 kilolitres of petrol. In 
addition, during the same year, 12 545 kilolitres of 
kerosene and 4472 million tonnes (MT) of LPG 
were imported. Figures 2 and 3 show trends in the 
import of petroleum fuels.
Electricity supply and consumption trends
Some salient features of Bhutan’s electricity sector 
are summarized below.
#
Power  generation  in  the  country  in  2005  was 
2521.25  MU,  while  18.39  MU  of  electricity 
was imported. Of the total electricity generated, 
1793.76  MU  of  electricity  was  exported  and 
745.88 MU was consumed in the country.
Of the total electricity consumed in the country, 
619 MU of power was sold and 112.43 MU of 
the  electricity  was  lost  within  the  system. The 
balance met the auxiliary power requirement in 
the power plants.
Peak demand in 2005 was 120 MW. 
#
Coal
Coal  meets  8%  of  the  energy  demand  in  the 
country. It is mostly used in the industrial sector. 
The total coal consumption in the country during 
2005  was  97  509  tonnes. The  total  coal  mined

from  local  coal  mines  was  85  279  tonnes,  while 
60  607  tonnes  of  coal  was  imported  in  the  same 
year. Bhutan also exported 48 377 tonnes of coal

Residential sector
Population distribution
Bhutan’s population of 634 982 (Census 2005) is 
distributed in 20 Dzongkhags. About 69% of this 
population  lives  in  rural  areas  and  31%  lives  in 
urban areas. Seventy-ﬁ ve per cent of this population 
is  concentrated  in  nine  Dzongkhags,  of  which  six 
are in the western region, two in the central region, 
and only one in the eastern region. Figure 5 shows 
the distribution of population, by Dzongkhag.
  The  residential  sector  accounts  for  48.7%  of 
the total energy consumption, making it a highest 
energy consumer. The sector’s 91% demand is met 
by biomass, and the remaining 9% is accounted for 
by fuels like LPG, electricity, and kerosene. In the 
residential sector, energy is mainly used for cooking 
(66% of the total residential energy share),4 which 
is  followed  by  fodder  cooking  (26%). There  is  a 
signiﬁ cant  difference  in  the  energy  consumption 
patterns  between  the  rural  and  urban  areas. 
While  rural  households  primarily  depend  on 
ﬁ rewood,  the  urban  households  rely  more  on 
electricity and petroleum fuels. 
  Figure  6  shows  energy  consumption  in  the 
residential sector, by Dzongkhag. 
Electrification status
As per the 2005 statistics, the country has 126 115 
households, of which 38 311 households are urban 
households and the remaining 87 804 households 
are  rural  households.  Of  these,  36  923  urban 
households (96.4%) and 35 140 rural households 
(40%) were electriﬁ ed, as of 2005. 
  The  Royal  Government  of  Bhutan  (RGoB) 
is  pursuing  rural  electriﬁ cation,  with  one  of  the 
objectives being reducing fuelwood consumption. 
These  rural  households  consumed  89  MU  of 
electricity in 2005, which was 14.6% of the total 
electricity consumption during the same period.
3  All units are in TOE.

It should be noted here that in a large number of households, same device is used for both cooking and space heating, making it difﬁ cult 
to apportion fuel use between the two end uses; in such a case, fuel use is apportioned to cooking.

FIGURE 5  DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION IN BHUTAN (2005)
Fodder cooking is treated separately at the end of 
this section. 
  Energy consumption for 2005, by fuel and end 
use, as estimated by the survey of 5450 households, 
carried out in Bhutan under the IEMMP project, 
is discussed subsequently.
In  the  Ninth  Five-year  Plan,  as  of  June  2007, 
15 148  households  have  been  electriﬁ ed.  In  the 
Tenth Five-year Plan (2008–13), a total of 43 951 
rural  unelectriﬁ ed  households  will  be  electriﬁ ed, 
thereby resulting in 100% rural electriﬁ cation.
 
Fuels and energy resources used in the 
residential sector
The  residential  sector  uses  fuelwood,  LPG, 
electricity, and kerosene as major fuels. The energy 
consumption  in  the  residential  sector  in  Bhutan 
is  dominated  by  high  consumption  of  fuelwood 
and  relatively  low  use  of  modern  fuels  like  LPG. 
Additionally, briquettes for space heating are being 
increasingly  used  in  urban  areas.  On  the  other 
hand,  solar  photovoltaic  (PV)  systems  have  been 
set up in remote areas for lighting purpose. 
  Major fuel-consuming activities in the residential 
sector are as follows.
#
Consumption analysis, by fuel
Fuelwood 
While  the  choice  of  the  fuel  depends  on  the 
availability  of  fuels  and  their  costs,  fuelwood  is 
the  most  commonly  used  fuel  in  Bhutan  and 
constitutes  about  90%  of  the  energy  used  in  the 
residential sector. 
  Rural areas have higher percentage of population 
(69%), which is allowed to collect fuelwood free of 
royalty, as per the policy of the RGoB. Rural areas 
are also the largest consumers of fuelwood. A total 
of  69  013  households  use  fuelwood  as  the  main 
source of cooking fuel (Census 2005).
  Fuelwood  is  collected  mostly  by  women,  and 
survey  indicates  that  on  an  average,  one  person 
month per year is spent in collecting fuelwood. A 
survey  of  household  energy  consumption  carried

households and 25 105 rural households (78.6%) 
use  electricity  as  the  main  fuel  for  lighting  and 
cooking  (Census  2005). This  shows  that  one  of 
the  objectives  of  rural  electriﬁ cation  –  to  reduce 
fuelwood  consumption  –  has  been  achieved 
successfully.    Studies  have  also  shown  that  there 
is about 25% reduction in fuelwood consumption 
in electriﬁ ed households in rural areas. 
  Cookers  and  water  boilers  (or  electric  kettles) 
are the major cooking equipment used for cooking 
in  these  households.  Besides,  these  electriﬁ ed 
households  use  electric  heaters,  refrigerators, 
washing  machines,  and  infotainment  gadgets  like 
TV,  music  players,  and  computers. The  IEMMP 
survey  has  come  up  with  the  fact  that  electricity 
is  mainly  consumed  for  cooking,  space  heating, 
and water heating applications in the colder areas. 
Electric heaters used for space heating vary in type 
and quality.
out  by  TERI  under  the  IEMMP  project  has 
found  that  the  per  capita  fuelwood  consumption 
in  the  residential  sector  is  about  0.78  tonne  per 
annum, accounting for 68% of the total fuelwood 
consumption in the country. 
  Cooking  and  space  heating  are  many  times

Kerosene 
Kerosene  is  the  third  most  preferred  fuel  in 
the  residential  sector  in  Bhutan,  after  fuelwood 
and  electricity.  In  2005,  the  residential  sector 
consumed  12  545  kilolitres  of  kerosene  (50% 
of  the  total  kerosene  used  in  the  country). 
Electricity 
In  electriﬁ ed  areas,  electricity  is  the  preferred

ENERGY SECTOR – AN OVERVIEW
According  to  Census  2005,  about  45  068  rural 
households  (36%  of  the  total  households  and 
51.3%  of  rural  households)  and  996  urban 
households  (2.8%  of  the  urban  households)  still 
use kerosene as the main fuel for lighting. The total 
number  of  households  that  use  kerosene  as  the 
main fuel for cooking is 11 342. Use of kerosene 
for  space  heating  is  not  very  common,  although 
in  urban  areas  of Thimphu,  space  heaters  based 
on kerosene are available. Because of the adverse 
health  impacts  of  using  kerosene  for  lighting, 
low-cost  wick  lamps  that  are  commonly  used 
for lighting need to be discouraged. Accordingly, 
measures  are  proposed  to  reduce  the  use  of 
kerosene for lighting.

USEFUL ENERGY DELIVERED USING DIFFERENT FUELS
Liqueﬁ ed petroleum gas
LPG is mostly used for cooking in the urban areas 
of  the  country.  In  2005,  total  LPG  consumption 
in the residential sector was 3522 tonnes, of which 
2613  tonnes  (74%)  was  consumed  in  the  urban 
sector. 
  LPG  is  supplied  to  Bhutan  at  concessional 
rates.  However,  the  selling  price  is  dependent 
on  transport  costs,  and  hence,  landed  costs  are 
substantially  higher  in  rural  areas.  Moreover, 
often users have to carry LPG cylinders manually 
due  to  the  non-connectivity  by  road/lack  of  road 
infrastructure, and this is one of the reasons for the 
less penetration of LPG in rural areas. It was found 
that LPG is the least preferred fuel in rural houses 
that are not accessible by motorable roads. 
  Use of LPG for applications other than cooking 
was  not  noticed  during  the  survey.  LPG  cook 
stoves  used  in  the  country  vary  widely  in  make 
and quality.

of fuelwood.
Industrial sector
The development path followed by Bhutan has led 
to  a  spurt  in  industrial  activities  in  the  past  few 
decades. Though the industrial sector in Bhutan has 
many small- and medium-scale industries, energy 
consumption in the industrial sector is dominated 
by  few  large  energy-intensive  industries.  The 
industrial sector is driven by the fact that Bhutan 
has  lowest  electricity  tariffs  in  the  region,  thus, 
making  electricity-intensive  industries  proﬁ table. 
Most  industries  are  located  in  the  southern 
Dzongkhag  of  Chukha,  Samtse,  Sarpang,  and 
Thimphu,  which  are  closer  to  the  Indian  border 
and also to Chukha Hydropower Plant. 
  Three large industries, namely, Bhutan Calcium 
and  Carbide  Ltd,  Penden  Cement  Authority 
Ltd, and Bhutan Ferro Alloys Ltd, are the major 
consumers of energy in Bhutan. These industries 
End-use devices efficiencies
Efﬁ ciencies of the end-use devices used as cooking 
appliances vary signiﬁ cantly, as shown in Table 3. 
These impact the amount of fuel used for getting 
similar amount of useful energy.
  As  shown  in Table  4,  useful  energy  delivered 
using different fuels, after considering the end-use 
device efﬁ ciency, also varies considerably.
It  can  be  seen  that  to  get  the  same  amount  of 
useful energy, 1 kWh of electricity replaces 1.74 kg

are also the major consumers of electricity in the 
country. In 2005, they together consumed 334 MU 
of electricity, which is 81% of the total electricity 
consumed in the industrial sector.
  The  industrial  sector  consumes  25.5%  of 
the  total  energy  and  is  the  largest  consumer  of 
electricity  in  the  country.  In  2005,  the  sector 
consumed  410  MU  of  electricity  (about  64.7% 
of the total electricity consumed in the country). 
Other fuels that are used in the sector include coal, 
furnace oil, kerosene, LDO, and fuelwood.
  Growth rate of value added in the industry (% 
per year) from 1994 to 2004 is given in Table 5.
  Sectoral share of GDP (% per year) in various 
sectors is given in Table 6.

of  diesel  and  13  879  kilolitres  of  petrol.  About 
1145  kilolitres  of  the  aviation  turbine  fuel  was 
consumed  during  the  same  period. The  country 
is fully dependent on transport fuel imports, and 
the imports are showing a rapid upward trend. The 
import of petrol has gone up more than three times 
over the period 1995–2005, while that of diesel has 
risen 2.5 times during the same period. 
  Besides  the  rising  cost  of  petrol  and  diesel, 
complete  dependence  of  the  transport  sector  on 
these  imported  fuels  is  an  area  of  concern  for 
future, from the energy security perspective.
Transport sector
The  transport  sector  in  Bhutan  is  characterized 
by  the  dominance  of  road  and  air  transport. 
Being a hilly country, rivers generally do not run 
very  deep,  and  hence,  the  use  of  waterways  for 
transport  is  negligible.  In  some  places,  ropeways 
are  being  used  for  the  transportation  of  logs  and 
other materials. 
Motorization trends in Bhutan
Bhutan has experienced high levels of motorization 
in  the  recent  years. The  motor  vehicle  ﬂ eet  has 
more than doubled in the last decade (1997–2007), 
with the number of registered motor vehicles rising 
from 13 584 at the end of 1997 to 30 733 vehicles 
by  the  end  of  March  2006. Thus,  the  number  of 
registered motor vehicles has exhibited an average 
annual growth rate of 10.4% during this period.
  Energy  consumption  in  the  transport  sector 
accounts for 13.7% of the total energy consumption. 
The  energy  is  used  in  the  transport  sector  for 
mainly road transport, which uses diesel and petrol. 
In  2005,  the  sector  used  about  48  703  kilolitres 
Commercial and institutional sector
Energy  consumption  by  the  commercial  and 
institutional  sector,  consisting  of  commercial 
establishments,  such  as  shops  and  hotels,  and 
institutional  establishments,  such  as  monasteries, 
government  ofﬁ ces,  schools,  hospitals,  and  so 
on,  accounts  for  10.2%  of  the  total  energy 
consumption.  The  sector  is  also  an  important

ENERGY SECTOR – AN OVERVIEW
Tourism industry
Tourism  is  Bhutan’s  third  largest  contributor  to 
economy, after electricity and industry. This sector 
is showing rapid growth, with substantial increase 
in  the  number  of  tourists  in  the  past  few  years. 
Arrival of tourists in Bhutan, by year, is shown in 
Figure 7.
them. Export of fruits and potatoes has shown an 
increasing trend in the recent years. 
Energy use in the agriculture sector
The  agriculture  sector  is  mainly  dependent  on 
human  and  animal  power.  However,  with  recent 
developments,  the  sector  is  increasingly  using 
state-of-the-art energy resources. 
  Electricity  in  the  agriculture  sector  is  mainly 
used for pumping. The sector consumed about 0.8 
MU of electricity in 2005, which is about 0.13% of 
the total electricity consumption of the country in 
2005. Other fuels used in the sector include diesel 
(about  544  kilolitres)  for  power  tillers,  which  are 
multipurpose devices for farmers. Subsidized power 
tillers are supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture. 
However, power tillers are predominantly used in 
few Dzongkhags only (Table 7). 
  Cardamom drying, oil extraction, and rice milling 
are  some  of  the  other  activities  that  use  energy 
resources  for  post-harvest  processing.  Overall, 
commercial and modern energy resources do not 
ﬁ nd much use in the agriculture sector compared 
to other sectors. Their use is likely to remain low in 
future too, as agriculture is constrained by natural 
factors such as mountainous terrain. With only 7% 
of  the  land  under  cultivation  and  rising  demand 
for land for other uses such as industries and urban 
settlements, agriculture is likely to continue to be 
at the same level as today.

Agriculture sector
Traditionally,  Bhutanese  agriculture  comprised 
subsistence  farming,  and  rural  households  were 
self-sufﬁ cient 
food  production.  Bhutan’s 
agricultural  sector,  which  employs  about  79% 
of  the  population  but  has  only  about  7%  of  the 
land  under  cultivation,  is  driven  substantially  by 
the non-commercial energy in the form of human 
labour and animal power. 
  Agriculture  activities  are  constrained  in  the 
region,  which  is  mostly  mountainous.  Because 
of  the  mountainous  terrain,  it  is  difﬁ cult  to 
have  large  farmlands  and  mechanized  farming. 
Besides, large tracts of land are under forests and 
reserved parks. Lack of access to market, absence 
of  approach  roads  from  farms  to  marketplace, 
and  lack  of  storage  and  post-harvest  processing 
facilities  are  also  some  of  the  constraints  faced 
by  the  agriculture  sector.  Recent  years  have  seen 
improvement in these facilities, and agriculture is 
slowly shifting towards growing horticulture crops 
and  cultivating  cash  crops  like  potato,  rice,  and 
so  on.  Cold  storage  facilities  have  been  created 
at  Paro  (close  to  airport)  and  Phuentsholing 
for  storing  apples  and  oranges  before  exporting 
in 
Energy situation in Bhutan in the regional 
context
The  per  capita  energy  and  electricity  supply 
are  still  way  below  the  world  average  (Table  8). 
However, in a regional context, Bhutan emerges as 
the leading country in South Asia, both in terms 
of total primary energy supply as well as electricity 
supply per capita per year.
SUMMARY OF MAJOR ISSUES FOR INTEGRATED 
ENERGY PLANNING
Heavy dependence of the residential sector on 
fuelwood  would  be  a  cause  of  concern  in  the 
years to come. Experience shows that because of 
electriﬁ cation,  fuelwood  consumption  reduces 
by about 30%–35%.

The  pattern  of  energy  consumption  by  the 
industrial  sector  would  play  a  major  role  in 
energy management. 
Rapidly  growing  transport  sector  is  entirely 
dependent  on  imported  fossil  fuels,  and  fuel 
consumption in this sector is a cause for concern 
mainly due to its impact on balance of trade and 
likely increase in pollution in the urban area. 
The  commercial  sector  is  showing  substantial 
growth  potential  and 
largest 
consumer of energy.
The agriculture sector consumes relatively less 
commercial energy.

Energy scenarios for Bhutan 2020
MODELLING DEMAND–SUPPLY SCENARIOS
Energy  is  one  of  the  major  drivers  of  economic 
growth.  Bhutan,  one  of  the  smallest  economies 
based  on  agriculture  and  forestry,  is  expected  to 
experience rapid economic growth and development 
in future, and the country’s requirements for energy 
and  supporting  infrastructure  would  increase  as 
well.  In  view  of  this,  an  integrated  assessment 
of  energy  demand  was  carried  out,  along  with 
determining  the  possible  energy  pathways  and 
their impacts on infrastructure requirements.
to policy analysis, without having to resort to more 
complex models. 
  LEAP model projections have been made under 
four  different  scenarios  for  electricity,  biomass, 
coal, liqueﬁ ed petroleum gas (LPG), petrol, diesel, 
kerosene, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF).
DEFINING SCENARIOS
Energy  scenarios  are  frameworks  for  analysing 
including  various 
future  energy  perspectives, 
combinations  of 
and 
interventions.  Scenarios  help  to  visualize  how 
the  future  is  going  to  unfold  under  different 
assumptions.  They  are  particularly  helpful  in 
investigating  alternative  future  developments  and 
their  implications.  Scenarios  can  be  based  on 
assumptions that are compatible with sustainable 
development  goals  like  improved  efﬁ ciencies, 
adoption of advanced energy supply technologies 
with low environmental impacts, and efﬁ cient use 
of natural resources. To have a look at the relative 
position  of  an  economy,  scenarios  can  also  be 
based on different economic growth trajectories. 
In the context of building scenarios for projecting 
energy  demand  for  Bhutan,  the  following  four 
scenarios have been considered.
#
technology  options 
DEMAND ANALYSIS USING LEAP
The energy demand projections have been carried 
out  for  a  period  up  to  2020  for  the  residential, 
industrial,  commercial  and 
institutional,  and 
sectors.  The  Long-range  Energy 
transport 
Alternatives  Planning  model,  or  LEAP,  is  a 
scenario-based  energy–environment  modelling 
tool.  Its  scenarios  are  based  on  comprehensive 
accounting of how energy is consumed, converted, 
and produced in a given region or economy under 
a range of alternative assumptions on population, 
economic  development,  technology,  and  price, 
among other factors. LEAP is useful in projecting 
energy supply and demand situations in order to 
provide  a  glimpse  of  future  patterns,  identifying 
potential problems, and assessing the likely impacts 
of energy policies. LEAP can assist in examining a 
wide variety of projects, programmes, technologies, 
and  other  energy  initiatives,  and  arriving  at 
strategies  that  best  address  environmental  and 
energy  problems. The  main  advantages  of  LEAP 
are  its  ﬂ exibility  and  ease-of-use,  which  allow 
decision-makers to move rapidly from policy ideas

The  subsequent  sections  brieﬂ y  deﬁ ne  the  broad 
characteristics  of  the  four  scenarios.  Detailed 
explanation of the assumptions for different sectors 
is outlined in the later part of the analysis.

Business-as-usual scenario
In  the  absence  of  any  technological  or  policy 
is  termed  as  the 
intervention,  this  scenario 
most  likely  path  of  development.  This  scenario 
incorporates existing government plans and policies. 
In the BAU scenario, an average real gross domestic 
product (GDP) growth rate of 7.7% (uniform over 
the  entire  modelling  frame,  that  is,  between  2005 
and 2020) has been considered. Sectoral variables 
grow with historical trends, and the speciﬁ c energy 
consumption of different sectoral activities remains 
at its current levels (2005).
ENERGY DEMAND PROJECTIONS, BY SECTOR
Residential sector
The energy demand projections for the residential 
sector  under  different  scenarios  have  been  made 
for  urban  and  rural  households  that  use  four 
different  categories  of  fuel:  (1)  electricity,  (2) 
LPG, (3) fuelwood, and (4) kerosene. 
  While  Bhutan 
is  aiming  at  100%  rural 
electriﬁ cation  by  2013,  till  electricity  extends  to 
all rural areas, lighting, cooking, and heating will 
continue to be primarily dependent on fuelwood. 
The  distribution  of  households  by  fuel  type  is 
presented in Table 1. 
Energy-efficient scenario
This  scenario  takes  into  account  the  speciﬁ c 
energy  efﬁ ciency  measures  spanning  across 
all  sectors.  These  measures  are  expected  to  be 
adopted uniformly across all sectors from 2008/09. 
Efﬁ ciency  improvements  in  existing  devices  and 
shifts to modern efﬁ cient technologies are the basic 
characteristics of this scenario. The sectoral variables 
are assumed to grow as per the BAU rates.

High growth scenario
This  scenario  assumes  a  high  GDP  growth 
rate  of  10%  (uniform  over  the  modelling  time 
frame,  2005–20)  compared  to  the  GDP  growth 
rate  of  7.7%  assumed  in  the  BAU  scenario. The 
HIG  scenario  is  characterized  by  a  shift  of  the 
economy towards the growth led by the industrial 
and  service  sector,  with  the  latter  dominating  in 
terms of its contribution to GDP. Speciﬁ c energy 
consumption  ﬁ gures  for  different  sectors  remain 
at  the  BAU  levels,  wherein  the  total  energy 
consumption  for  different  fuels  under  different 
sectors  is  much  higher  due  to  higher  growth  of 
the sectoral variables.

The  pattern  of  using  fuels  is  not  same  in  rural 
and  urban  areas.  Urban  households  depend  less 
on  kerosene  and  fuelwood  due  to  relatively  high 
usage  of  electricity  and  LPG.  In  rural  areas,  a 
considerable  proportion  of  the  households  still 
depends  on  traditional  fuels  due  to  non/less 
availability of modern cleaner fuels.
  The  total  consumption  of  these  fuels,  by  and 
large,  depends  on  the  growth  rate  of  the  sectoral 
variables,  the  intensity  of  their  use,  the  future 
penetration  rate  of  devices/modern  fuels,  and 
their  usage  pattern  among  different  categories  of 
households. Table  2  gives  the  assumptions  under 
High growth coupled with energy efficiency 
scenario
Finally,  the  HIGEE  scenario  combines  a  high 
GDP  growth  rate  of  10%  with  high  energy 
efﬁ ciency measures. This scenario is representative 
of  the  most  optimistic  scenario  in  terms  of  both 
economic growth and technological interventions, 
steering  the  economy  towards  the  most  energy-
efﬁ cient path.

projected  population  up  to  2020,  based  on  the 
above  details,  is  given  in  Annexure  3.1.  Rural 
electriﬁ cation,  which  at  present  stands  at  40%, 
is  assumed  to  take  place  uniformly  across  all  the 
scenarios, according to the plans laid down in the 
Rural Electriﬁ cation Master Plan (REMP); urban 
and  rural  electriﬁ cation  is  expected  to  reach  the 
100% level by the end of the Tenth Five-year Plan 
(the  current  target  is  also  to  achieve  100%  rural 
electriﬁ cation  by  the  end  of  the Tenth  Five-year 
Plan). As far as the distribution of households in 
rural and urban areas is concerned, Census 2005 
reports that 30.4% of the total population lives in 
urban areas and the rest 69.6% lives in rural areas. 
Given  the  historical  trend  of  urban  migration 
(prior  to  2000),  Vision  2020  predicts  that  urban 
population will equal rural population by the end 
of  2020,  which  also  holds  true  for  the  BAU  and 
EE scenarios. However, in the other two scenarios 
various  scenarios  for  determining  the  major 
sectoral variables. 
  The energy demand projection for the domestic 
sector  is  conﬁ ned  to  regular  households  only, 
although  the  census  divides  the  households 
into  regular,  institutional,  and  transient.  This  is 
due  to  the  fact  that  the  household  break-up  by 
activities and fuel type is available only for regular 
households. According to Population and Housing 
Census of Bhutan 2005, a total of 126 115 regular 
households  have  been  recorded  in  Bhutan. They 
account  for  91%  of  the  total  resident  population 
(634  982)  and  86.3%  of  the  total  population 
(resident  plus  ﬂ oating)  of  Bhutan.  The  average 
weighted  household  size  is  estimated  to  be  4.6. 
One  year  before  the  census,  the  natural  growth 
rate  of  population  was  found  to  be  1.3%.  This 
data  is  assumed  to  remain  constant  over  the 
modelling  time  frame  under  all  scenarios.  The

fuels could well lead to a 100% penetration of LPG 
in rural and urban households in the HIG scenario. 
However,  in  the  baseline  and  EE  scenarios,  it  is 
assumed that by 2020, penetration would reach a 
maximum of 88.5%, based on a simple average of 
the  existing  and  the  HIG  percentages.  Kerosene 
consumption in the HIG and HIGEE scenarios is 
assumed  to  come  down  to  0%  because  of  faster 
switching  to  cleaner  fuels,  with  4.65%  being  the 
‘end-of-model’  period  value  under  the  BAU  and 
EE  scenarios  (simple  average).  As  evident  from 
Table  3,  fuelwood  is  being  used  by  10%  of  the 
urban  households. With  access  to  modern  fuels, 
this dependence is assumed to come down to 5% 
by 2020 under the BAU and EE scenarios and to 
1% in the extreme scenarios.
  Fuelwood  and  kerosene,  which  at  present 
are  consumed  by  more  than  50%  of  the  regular 
households, are later to be replaced by electricity 
and LPG. Kerosene usage will experience a steep 
fall  in  the  HIG  scenario,  where  the  percentage 
usage will come down to 10% by 2020 as against 
51% in 2005. Fuelwood usage will drop to 30% in 
the HIG scenario as against 40% in the BAU and 
EE scenarios. The use of LPG, which is at present 
used by only 20.3% of the households, is assumed 
to  reach  35%  in  the  BAU  and  EE  scenarios  and 
50% in the HIG and HIGEE scenarios. The energy 
(HIG and HIGEE), the recent migration pattern 
has  been  taken  into  account  (2000–05  and  then 
annualized), which shows that by 2020, about 65% 
of the total population will live in urban areas.
  The  pattern  and  type  of  fuel  usage  are  not 
uniform across different categories of households 
and  are  found  to  vary  signiﬁ cantly. The  usage  is 
largely  governed  by  the  availability  and  paying 
capacities of the households. With economic growth 
and  access  to  cleaner  fuels,  the  usage  pattern 
is  assumed  to  change  signiﬁ cantly,  especially  in 
the  HIG  scenario. Table  3  shows  how  the  usage 
pattern  is  expected  to  change  across  households 
and scenarios.
  With complete electriﬁ cation envisaged for rural 
and urban areas by 2013, almost all the households 
will be using electricity. According to TERI survey, 
electricity  in  urban  areas  is  used  for  lighting, 
cooking,  space  heating,  washing,  refrigeration, 
and  for  other  infotainment  devices  like TV  and 
radio.  On  the  other  hand,  in  rural  households, 
the usage is conﬁ ned to lighting, cooking, and for 
running television and radios. The usages of these 
devices  across  economies  by  the  rural  and  urban 
households  have  been  obtained  from  the  Bhutan 
Census Report.

Energy demand for the residential sector
The  residential  sector  consumes  about  49%  of 
the  total  energy  consumed  in  the  economy,  the 
largest  amongst  all  sectoral  shares. The  relatively 
high  energy  consumption  is  on  account  of  the 
intensities  (consumption  of  fuels  per  household) 
for the above-mentioned fuels by end-use devices 
and scenarios are presented in Table 4.

signiﬁ cant dependence of the sector on fuelwood. 
Fuelwood  share  in  the  total  energy  basket  in 
2005  was  92%. The  share  of  electricity  was  4%, 
while  that  for  LPG  and  kerosene,  it  was  close  to 
2.5%  and  1.5%,  respectively.  The  demand  for 
different  types  of  fuels  under  four  scenarios  is 
given  in  Figures  1–4. The  focus  of  the  proposed 
sustainable  development  strategy  would  be  on 
reducing fuelwood share in the residential sector. 
This  can  be  achieved  by  the  (1)  introduction  of 
high  efﬁ ciency  cook  stoves  and  (2)  switching  to 
modern fuels like LPG, electricity, and renewable 
energy  like  solar  cooking,  biogas-based  cooking, 
and home heating systems.

The  consumption  of  LPG  is  found  to  be  on  the 
lower side compared to other fuels but is expected 
to increase by 2.4 times the present consumption 
of 2900 tonnes. 
  Recent data shows an increasing trend for private 
sector industries. Private sector industries grew from 
15 489 in 2004 to 24 417 in 2006, an increase of 
57% in two years. Notably, the large-scale industries 
grew  from  47  in  2004  to  72  in  2006.  Substantial 
growth  can  be  noticed  in  small-scale  industries, 
which  ranged  from  628  in  2004  to  1660  in  2006, 
logging more than 160% growth in two years.
In the HIG scenario, consumption could reach 
9000 tonnes. Achievable efﬁ ciency improvement is 
5%, as the devices in use do not have a scope for 
improvement, which can lead to the reduction in 
the  consumption,  with  the  ﬁ gures  in  the  EE  and 
HIGEE  scenarios  being  6200  and  8800  tonnes, 
respectively.

Industrial sector
in  Bhutan 
Till  1998,  the 
played  a  limited  role  in  the  country’s  economic 
development.  The  sectoral  (secondary  sector) 
GDP  to  country’s  total  GDP  was  close  to  30% 
(between 1990 and 1998). Thereafter, the sectoral 
contribution  improved,  and  between  1999  and 
2002,  the  sectoral  share  increased  from  36.5% 
to  38%.  However,  after  2002,  it  experienced  a 
declining trend, reaching as low as 35% in 2004. 
In Bhutan, industries are broadly classiﬁ ed under 
three categories: (1) private, (2) joint ventures, and 
(3) public. The number of private sector units has 
grown considerably between 2000 and 2004. From 
5678 in 1999, the private sector units increased to 
15 489 by 2004. The joint and public sectors did 
not  experience  much  of  a  change  in  the  number 
of  establishments  during  the  said  period.  Joint 
sectors increased from 5 to 15 units, with closing 
down of some of the existing ones, while the public 
sector grew marginally at 17 units between 1999 
and 2004. Table 5 shows the trend in the number 
of industries under the three categories.
Within the industrial sector, the manufacturing and 
mining industries play a crucial role in determining 
the present and future energy demand. According to 
the MoEA (Ministry of Economic Affairs) estimates 
for  2004,  a  total  of  874  units  existed  under  the 
mining and manufacturing industries, of which 858 
were completely under the private sector. The rest 
16 were under joint and public sector undertakings. 
Table  6  shows  the  growth  in  the  number  of  units 
under the production and manufacturing category 
(between 2002 and 2004).

by  22  medium  voltage  industries  consuming 
8%,  and  122  low  voltage  industries  consuming 
roughly about 3% of the total electricity. As far as 
the energy projection for the sector is concerned, 
analysis has been done separately for both energy-
intensive and non-energy-intensive industries.
  Given  the  above  complexities,  the  criterion 
used  to  identify  energy-intensive  industries  is 
the share of fuel cost to total cost of production. 
Based  on  the  ﬁ gures  published  in  the  Census  of 
Manufacturing Industries 2001, the average share 
of  energy  expenditure  to  total  was  estimated  at 
the  sectoral  level.  The  relative  position  of  the 
industries  (whether  energy  intensive  or  not)  is 
classiﬁ ed  based  on  the  fact  whether  the  share  of 
the cost of fuel to total cost of production exceeds 
the  economy’s  average.  Data  related  to  fuel  and 
total costs was not available for the iron and steel 
plant. As a result, the data for the same has been 
assumed to be similar to that of the Indian industry 
for 2000. The value obtained for the industry was 
found to be 0.17, which is above the average value 
calculated for Bhutan (0.055). Table 7 shows the 
list  of  industries,  which  can  be  categorized  as 
energy intensive.
Within  the  industrial  sector,  the  construction 
activities have been the major contributor to growth 
and  contributed  between  13%  and  18%  of  the 
GDP. The manufacturing sector has accounted for 
around 8%–9% of the GDP, while the electricity, 
water, and gas sectors have been close to 10% of 
the GDP (Figure 5).

Energy-intensive industries
Of the six industries listed above, the ﬁ rst three are 
listed under the high voltage category consumers, 
while  the  rest  are  under  the  medium  voltage 
category.  In  2005,  these  six  industries  consumed 
electricity equivalent to 377 million kWh (close to 
90%  of  the  total  sectoral  electricity  consumption 
of  420  million  kWh  and  62%  of  the  country’s 
electricity consumption of 615 million kWh). 
  The energy-intensive industries indicated above 
are  export  oriented,  with  India  as  their  major 
international  market.  The  geographical  pattern 
of  the  sales  of  four  energy-intensive  industries  is 
presented in Table 8.
The rest are classiﬁ ed under the category of non-
energy-intensive  industries.  These  industries  are

come on stream between 2008 and 2009. Of these 
55 industries, nine industries fall under ferro-alloy 
category, two under steel rolling, four under steel 
ingots, and one each is categorized under cement 
and magnesium metal. The production capacities 
of the existing energy-intensive industries and the 
upcoming ones are indicated in Table 9.
  These industries mostly consume electricity as 
fuel in production. Signiﬁ cant coal usage is found 
in  cement  plants.  As  far  as  the  consumption  of 
petroleum  products  is  concerned,  industries  are 
found  to  consume  high  speed  diesel  (HSD),  
furnace  oil  (FO),  and  light  diesel  oil  (LDO).  Of 
the total industrial consumption of HSD (10 120 
kilolitres)  in  2004,  energy-intensive  industries 
consumed  1000  kilolitres,  approximately  10%  of 
the total industrial usage. A considerable amount 
of  FO  (93%  of  the  total  industrial  use)  is  also 
used. However, the usage of LDO is low compared 
to  total  industrial  usage,  which  is  approximately 
3%.  Compared  to  these  fuels,  electricity

used  extensively 
  PCAL, the largest cement plant in Bhutan, caters 
to  Bhutan,  with  70%  of  its  sales  in  the  domestic 
market due to the demand from under construction 
hydropower  project.  This  domestic  demand  is 
likely  to  taper  off  in  the  coming  years  with  the 
completion of the Tala Hydel Power Project. This 
can, to some extent, affect the business of the plant, 
and  if  no  substantial  demand  is  generated,  the 
plant has to depend on the market of neighbouring 
countries, especially Nepal, Bangladesh, and India. 
Notwithstanding increasing liberalization of these 
economies, there is a possibility of having to cope 
with greater competition. For example, there were 
concerns that calcium carbide exports from China 
were driving down the price of calcium carbide in 
India, thereby posing a threat to Bhutan’s calcium 
carbide exports. This implies that the cement and 
other industries have to improve their production 
efﬁ ciency to remain competitive internationally. 
  According to the list provided by the BPC, a total 
of  55  industries  (Annexure  3.2)  have  been  given 
license to operate in Bhutan and are expected to

The  present  total  electricity  consumption  by 
energy-intensive industries is 377 million kWh and 
is  expected  to  reach  2192  million  kWh  by  2020 
under the BAU scenario. 
  Electricity  saving  potential  is  close  to  10%, 
which  can  lead  to  reduced  consumption  to  the

Nu 400 million approximately (Figure 6).
  Total electricity consumption by energy-intensive 
industries will go up to 2782 million kWh by 2020 
under  the  HIG  scenario. This  estimate  is  mainly 
based  on  the  assumption  that  all  types  of  new 
industries  will  be  allowed.  The  saving  potential 
under this scenario is about 210 million kWh.

Energy demand for different fuels by non-
energy-intensive industries
In  2004,  a  total  of  864  non-energy-intensive 
industries  existed  in  Bhutan.  Because  of  the 
unavailability of data for 2005, the annual average 
growth rate (between 2000 and 2004) was used to 
arrive  at  the  2005  ﬁ gure  on  the  number  of  non-
energy-intensive  industries,  the  number  of  which 
was  pegged  at  980.  Under  the  baseline  scenario, 
the total number of industries is expected to reach 
the 3500 mark, on the assumption that the average 
annual  growth  rate  remains  at  9%,  the  annual 
growth rate for these industries between 1990 and 
2004. In the HIG scenario, the number of operating 
industry is expected to reach 6300 by 2020, on the 
assumption  that  the  average  annual  growth  rate 
is  14%,  which  the  industry  experienced  between 
2000 and 2004. Table 11 presents the assumptions 
for  estimating  the  number  of  industries  and  the 
energy 
intensities  (energy  consumption  per 
establishment) under four different scenarios.

FIGURE 7  DEMAND FOR COAL IN INDUSTRIES
Coal
Bhutan’s  coal  import  in  2005  was  estimated 
at  124  000  tonnes.  Cement  industry  was  the 
largest  consumer,  with  consumption  close  to  58 
000  tonnes. With  the  expansion  in  existing  plant 
capacities  and  setting  up  of  new  industries,  the 
demand is estimated to rise to 586 000 tonnes by 
the end of 2020 (Figure 7).
  Demand  side  management  can  help  reduce 
total coal consumption by 21%, that is, to 450 000 
tonnes approximately (Figure 7). Coal consumption 
under the HIG and HIGEE scenarios is assumed to 
be same as that under the BAU and EE scenarios, 
since  most  of  the  additional  proposed  industries 
assumed to be established under the HIG scenario 
are not likely to use coal. 
In  addition  to  normal  growth  of  the  existing 
industries, 38 new licenses have also been awarded. 
Majority  of  these  industries  are  into  agro-based 
food  products,  silk  fabric,  and  marble  slabs. 
Approximately, 26 MW power has been allocated, 
and these units are expected to consume 65 million 
kWh per annum. Based on these ﬁ gures, the average 
electricity consumption per unit is calculated to be 
1.7 million kWh. However, with proper efﬁ ciency 
measures,  the  consumption  per  unit  can  come

impact  on 
Tourism  can  have  a  substantial 
Bhutan’s  economic  sector.  Furthermore,  tourism 
is  the  second  largest  foreign  currency  earner 
and  the  most  important  contributor  in  terms  of 
free  convertible  currency  (Strategy  Document, 
Department of Tourism, 2005). There has been a 
considerable growth in the inﬂ ow of international 
tourists in the recent past. The total international 
arrival  at  the  end  of  1996  was  estimated  to  be 
5137, and by 2006, the total inﬂ ow reached an all 
time high of 17 342. Figure 10 presents the tourist 
inﬂ ow in Bhutan between 1996 and 2005.
  As per the latest records, Bhutan has more than 
175  hotels  with  more  than  4000  beds.  Average 
duration  of  stay  per  tourist  in  Bhutan  has  been 
estimated  to  be  approximately  10  days. As  far  as 
the consumption of energy by these international 
tourists  is  concerned,  the  typical  energy  basket 
includes electricity, LPG, and petroleum products.

2020 under the BAU scenario, while in the HIG 
scenario, the demand will be 346 MU by 2020.
  Energy saving potential for this sector is close to 
10%,  which  can  help  reduce  consumption  by  20

approximately  15%.  Based  on  this  estimate,  the 
total  number  of  tourists  visiting  Bhutan  by  2020 
under the two scenarios is expected to be 110 900. 
However, the inﬂ ux rate has changed signiﬁ cantly 
over  the  past  ﬁ ve  years.  In  2001,  the  number  of 
foreign  tourists  visiting  Bhutan  was  6395,  which 
increased to 13 626 by 2005, marking an annual 
average growth rate of 21%. Based on this growth 
rate,  the  ﬁ nal  ﬁ gure  for  2020  is  237  800.  Each 
tourist  is  estimated  to  consume  about  261  kWh 
of electricity and 6.21 kg of LPG. Use of energy-
efﬁ cient lighting and heating can reduce electricity 
consumption  by  30%. As  a  result,  the  electricity 
intensity  (electricity  usage  per  tourist)  can  come 
down  to  183  kWh.  As  far  as  LPG  consumption 
is  concerned,  there  may  not  be  a  far-reaching 
improvement, as even the existing LPG cook stoves 
are highly energy efﬁ cient. However, some research 
studies  suggest  that  efﬁ ciency  can  be  improved 
further by regular cleaning of stoves, using materials 
that have high heat conductivity for cooking, and so 
on. The  efﬁ ciency  attainable  is  5%  of  the  existing 
stoves,  thus  resulting  in  the  reduction  of  the  per 
capita consumption to 5.8 kg of LPG.

While the consumption of electricity and LPG is 
discussed in this section, petroleum consumption 
is  dealt  with  separately  in  the  section  on  the 
transport sector. 
  Based on a rapid appraisal survey in three hotels 
in Thimphu, the electricity and LPG consumption 
per  capita  was  estimated. Table  12  describes  in 
detail  the  assumptions  made  in  regard  to  the 
number of tourists expected to visit Bhutan, their 
energy  consumption  under  different  scenarios, 
and the saving potential.
  The  estimation  of  the  number  of  tourists 
between 2005 and 2020 under the BAU and EE 
scenarios  is  based  on  the  annual  average  inﬂ ux 
of  foreign  tourists  in  Bhutan  between  1991

experienced  a  healthy  growth  rate  between  2000

the  total  number  of  institutions  (based  on  BPC 
estimates) was 1578, which reached 2539 by 2003. 
Since ﬁ gures for 2005 were not available, the base

The  commercial  sector  contributed  about  4% 
to  the  total  GDP  in  2000. With  sustained  high 
growth, the sector’s total contribution has almost 
doubled  in  a  span  of  ﬁ ve  years. The  number  of 
establishments,  too,  has  grown  during  the  same 
period.  As  per  the  records  of  the  BPC,  5431

available  data,  the  average  growth  rate  of  7% 
(growth between 2000 and 2005) has been used to 
arrive at the 2005 ﬁ gure, which is pegged at 6090 
(Table  14).  Based  on  this  rate,  the  total  number 
of such establishments can reach 16 460 by 2020. 
On the other hand, a high growth rate of 10% can 
raise the number to 24 900.
  The data on the total electricity supplied to the 
commercial  sector  has  been  obtained  from  the 
BPC. The average annual electricity consumption 
was  estimated  at  3645  kWh.  Given  the  energy 
saving  potential  of  30%  by  switching  to  efﬁ cient

Bhutan  is  characterized  by  the  heterogeneity  of 
motor vehicles in terms of the fuel consumed and 
the  end-use  purpose  served  by  each  category  of 
motor  vehicles. The  import  of  various  categories 
of vehicles, along with their fuel type, is presented 
in Figures 15 and 16.
  Surface  transport  (road  transport) 
is  the 
dominant mode of passenger and freight movement 
for both inter- and intra-city movement in Bhutan. 
Furthermore, the absence of domestic air network 
linking  different  cities/towns  and  the  lack  of 
alternative/competing  transportation  modes  have 
made  the  road-based  transportation  modes  the 
preferred modes for transportation. With the growth 
in the construction sector, transport, storage, and 
communication  have  contributed  signiﬁ cantly  to 
the GDP. In 2000, the share of the sector to total 
GDP was 8.8%, which increased to 10.6% at the 
end of 2005. The sectoral growth rate in 2000 was 
found to be 10%, which signiﬁ cantly increased to 
16.5% in 2005. The growth rate of the transport 
sector  and  its  contribution  to  GDP,  by  year,  are

  Of the three major transportation fuels imported 
in Bhutan, diesel has the largest share—in 2005, it 
was close to 78% (51 440 kilolitres), followed by 
petrol at 20% (13 755 kilolitres) and ATF close to 
2%  (1200  kilolitres). The  average  annual  growth 
rate  of  the  demand  for  petrol  has  been  greater 
than  that  of  diesel.  Between  1996  and  2005,  the 
annual growth rate of petrol was 15.3% and that of 
diesel, 12%. The sustained growth in demand for 
diesel has been because of the construction sector. 
Construction of three major hydel power projects, 
that  is,  Kurichu,  Basochhu,  and  Tala,  between 
1996 and 2005, has contributed to the increased 
diesel  consumption  (increased  transportation  of 
materials)  in  a  major  way.  Again,  the  growing 
economy,  with  increased  per  capita  income  and 
stable  inﬂ ation,  has  led  to  the  growth  in  private 
transport  vehicles,  thus  leading  to  increased 
petrol  consumption. As  far  as  the ATF  import  is 
concerned,  till  2004,  the  demand  grew  at  a  very 
low rate. Increase in international tourists, coupled 
with the opening of new routes, has led to a sudden 
spurt in the demand for ATF. The growth rate for 
2005 was 7.5% as against an average of 6.8%.

It is observed from Table 16 that when the GDP 
increases by Nu 1 million, the consumption of diesel, 
petrol, and ATF increases by 2.49, 0.711, and 0.043 
kilolitres, respectively. Using this estimate, the future 
demand for these petroleum products is estimated 
based  on  the  assumption  that  the  average  annual 
real GDP growth rate is 7.3%, the average growth 
rate  obtained  from  2000–05  estimate  (National 
Statistics  Bureau  2005).  In  the  HIG  scenario,  the 
average growth rate considered is 10%, which the 
economy achieved in 2002 (9.99%). Based on recent 
research, there is a signiﬁ cant scope for improving 
fuel efﬁ ciencies, especially for the vehicles running 
on petrol and diesel. As far as the vehicle category

assumptions  of  growth  and  efﬁ ciencies,  the 
demand  for  petroleum  products  for  Bhutan  has 
been  estimated  till  2020  under  four  different 
scenarios.  Figures  18–20  present  the  projected

Energy supply options for Bhutan
INTRODUCTION
The role of energy is crucial for any country that 
is  traversing  the  rapid  development  path.  It  is  an 
established  fact  that  with  the  provision  of  energy, 
the quality of life improves considerably—education 
standards improve, along with health and hygiene, 
particularly  that  of  women  and  children  who 
otherwise  spend  considerable  time  in  collecting 
fuels.  An  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  study 
(2003) revealed that increased access to electricity 
raised  the  incomes  of  the  Bhutanese  people, 
lessened the extent of health burden, and positively 
contributed to improved education levels.
  The  Royal  Government  of  Bhutan  (RGoB) 
recognizes  the  importance  of  energy  and  has 
been  taking  several  measures  to  accomplish  its 
ambitious goal of ‘electricity for all by 2020’, now 
revised to 2013 with the Druk Phuensum Tshogpa 
(DPT) Government in power. Bhutan is endowed 
with  rich  water  resources,  along  with  abundant 
biomass  reserves,  both  being  key  energy  sources 
for  fulﬁ lling  the  country’s  energy  needs.  Both 
these resources are being exploited in a sustainable 
manner to fulﬁ l the energy needs of the people. The 
government  has  formulated  Rural  Electriﬁ cation 
Master Plan (REMP) 2005, which provides a road 
map to achieve 100% electriﬁ cation in the country 
within the stipulated time frame.
  As  explained  earlier,  the  energy  needs  of  the 
Bhutanese  economy  can  be  categorized  in  the 
following manner. 
#
Fuels  to  meet  heat  and  mechanical  energy 
demand  of  the  industrial,  commercial,  and 
residential sectors (excluding electricity)   
#
This chapter covers the supply side options to meet 
the  demand,  including  various  renewable  energy 
options for sustainable supply of energy.
THE POLICY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR 
THE POWER SECTOR
The policy for the power sector is in the draft stage; 
however,  the  policy  and  planning  of  the  power 
sector in Bhutan have two major objectives.
1 Emphasis on power exports to strengthen the  
  economy
2 Supply of reliable, environment-friendly, and  
  affordable power for all citizens
The  overall  policy  and  regulatory  interventions 
are  guided  by  these  two  broad  objectives.  The 
accelerated  hydropower  development  has  been 
identiﬁ ed as an option for achieving these objectives.  
The Ninth and the Tenth Five-year Plans indicate 
the policy direction for this sector.
  To  ensure  reliable  and  affordable  supply  of 
electricity,  the  policy  measures  include  allocating 
15%  of  annual  energy  generated  from  all  large 
hydropower plants for domestic consumption at a 
nominal rate of 0.3 Nu/unit. This is applicable for 
the power plants owned by the government or its 
entities.  
  For  the  supply  of  safe  and  reliable  power,  the 
Bhutan  Electricity  Authority  (BEA)  has  put  in 
process a transparent methodology for determining 
tariffs for power generation and consumption for 
different  user  categories.  The  policy  is  working

towards gradually removing subsidy being provided 
to  high  voltage  and  medium  voltage  consumers 
by  2011.  As  for  others,  primarily  the  residential 
sector, the power would be supplied at subsidized 
rates  as  a  social  obligation  so  as  to  ensure  socio-
economic development.
  Given  dispersed  population  and  the  complex 
terrain, the electricity supply to all would require 
major ﬁ nancial resources for grid extension.
  Thus,  the  critical  policy  issues  in  the  power 
sector  are  (1)  accelerating  development  of  the 
hydropower  sector  by  attracting  investments  and 
assuring  reliable  supply,  considering  the  seasonal 
variations in supply; and (2) extending the grid to 
supply  affordable  power  to  all,  without  affecting 
economic viability in the power sector.
  A  range  of  options  to  address 
these issues is as follows.

present, the sector accounts for about 22% of gross 
domestic product (GDP), with 40% contribution 
towards the total national revenue generation. The 
latter  ﬁ gure  would  have  been  reached  60%  with 
the  commissioning  of Tala  Hydropower  Plant  in 
2007, but it is still about 40% because of the rapid 
growth in other sectors. 
  The  hydropower  potential  of  the  techno-
economically feasible sites is estimated to be about 
23  760 MW, of which thus far only 1.6% has been 
developed  (Table  1). With  the  commissioning  of 
Tala  Hydropower  Project  (1020  MW),  the  total 
installed  capacity  has  risen  to  1488  MW,  and 
the  mean  annual  generation  is  now  about  7412  
gigawatt-hours (GWh).

  While the hydropower sector is the propeller of 
the Bhutan’s economy, to ensure that hydropower 
development  does  not  take  place  in  a  haphazard 
manner  but  proceeds  on  the  basis  of  careful 
identiﬁ cation  of  most  promising  sites,  the  RGoB 
updated  the  Power  System  Master  Plan  (PSMP) 
of  1993  for  the  period  1990–2010  to  cover 
partially the period 2003–22 in its Water Resource 
Management  Plan  (WRMP)  2004.  The WRMP 
2004  screened  hydropower  projects  on  the  basis 
of technical and economic criteria to select most 
promising projects, which were then subjected to 
Multiple Criteria Analysis (MCA)1 for the eventual 
adoption in the WRMP.

These would be dealt with in detail subsequently.
POWER SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
The  power  sector  in  Bhutan  is  synonymous  with 
the  hydropower  sector,  with  more  than  99%  of 
electricity  being  generated  by  the  hydropower 
sector. The hydropower sector has been the main 
driver  of  the  Bhutanese  economy,  and  through 
revenue earnings from the sale of electricity, it has 
spurred country’s socio-economic development. At 
1  MCA  facilitates  comparison  of  projects  that  may  have  different  types  of  impacts  of  highly  varying  magnitude. The  variables  are 
grouped  under  four  key  criteria,  representing  important  objectives  of  the  Government  of  Bhutan:  technical,  economic,  social,  and 
environmental.

Seasonal variation in electricity production
Bhutan  has  been  exploiting  its  vast  hydropower 
potential  in  a  sustainable  manner,  with  the 
existing  plants  being  run-of-the-river  schemes  as 
opposed  to  storage-based  plants. While  the  run-
of-the-river  schemes  ensure  relatively  benign  use 
of environmental resources, the biggest challenge 
posed by them is their inability to operate at full 
capacity  in  the  lean  season  when  the  river  ﬂ ow 
remains  low.  This  is  particularly  true  in  winter 
months  when  the  demand  is  at  the  peak  without 
secure sources of energy supply. 
  With  the  commissioning  of Tala  Hydropower 
Plant,  288  MW  of  ﬁ rm  power  (power  available 
in  the  lean  season)  is  available.    Currently,  the 
peak  demand  is  about  211  MW,  and  as  per  the 
demand  projections,  it  would  rise  to  about  500 
MW  in  near  future  (2012),    if  all  the  sanctioned 
industries  become  operational. The  Department 
of  Energy  (DoE)  plans  to  tackle  this  shortage  in 
the following ways. 
#
  The WRMP  2004  identiﬁ ed  78  potential  run-
of-the-river  projects  in  Bhutan  for  hydropower 
development,  with  capacity  above  10  MW,  and 
estimated that if 25 of the 78 sites were developed, 
the  installed  capacity  would  be  around  16  435 
MW.  Based on the screening of the projects, six 
potential projects were selected for implementation 
during the Power Master Plan period of 2003–22.  
The details of these are provided in Table 2.

  While  there  exists  considerable  hydropower 
potential  in  Bhutan,  there  are  several  constraints 
in  fully  exploiting  this  potential,  encompassing 
technical,  ﬁ nancial,  environmental,  and  market 
limitations.    One  unique  characteristic  of  the 
Bhutanese power sector is its complete dependence 
on  hydropower  and  run-of-the-river  type  plants.

unviable and unattractive.

Financing of hydropower projects
The  issue  of  raising  capital  to  invest  in  the 
additional  power  generation  is  a  big  challenge 
for Bhutan, which does not have an international 
credit rating. As seen in Table 2, for the six potential 
power  plants,  determined  by  the WRMP  (2004), 
an investment of about $3660 million is required, 
which translates into capital expenditure of $183 
million per year. 
  Mobilization of the resources of this magnitude, 
however, remains a critical issue, given the limited 
plants

  Given that the investment in large hydropower 
projects  is  not  readily  forthcoming,  it  remains 
important  from  the  energy  security  perspective 
that plants of small or medium capacities, typically 
about  100  MW  capacity  each,  are  planned  and 
established. These  plants  should  be  promoted  in 
eastern  Dzongkhags,  which  are  underdeveloped 
and where power outages are very common.
  To accelerate the development of the hydropower 
sector  in  Bhutan,  Hydropower  Policy,  2008,  has 
been  ﬁ nalized,  although  it  is  yet  to  be  notiﬁ ed. 
Besides, a holding company called the Druk Green 
Power Corporation (DGPC) has been established 
to  allow  for  optimal  utilization  of  resources  and 
enhance  capacity  building.  It  would  also  serve 
as  an  investment  arm  of  the  government,  which 
would invest in future hydropower projects.

  For  an  accelerated  development  of 
hydropower sector, case studies have been evaluated

discussed in subsequent sections.
domestic  resources  and  the  current  problems  in 
attracting private sector to invest in the hydropower 
sector. 
  Though  the  Government  of  India  has  been 
expressing  interest  in  ﬁ nancing  the  hydropower 
sector  in  Bhutan  and  has  also  committed  to 
purchase  extra  power,  the  question  is  to  what 
extent  can  Bhutan  expect  such  ﬁ nancing  options 
from  India  (Table  3).  According  to  the WRMP,  
a  number  of  factors  would  eventually  determine 
the  availability  of  international  ﬁ nancing  for 
hydropower  development  in  Bhutan. The  major 
challenge  for  hydropower  funding  is  devising 
packages with debt servicing and maturities. Often, 
the potential imbalance between revenue and debt 
service, along with the level of risk involved in the 
project,  prevents  investors  from  ﬁ nancing  large 
hydropower projects.
  The most important factor with respect to the 
above  is  the  size  of  the  schemes—given  the  large 
size of hydropower schemes, ﬁ nancing is difﬁ cult. 
It  is  suggested  that  to  overcome  this  problem,  a 
public–private  model,  together  with  the  backing 
of  an  international  lending  agency,  could  be 
considered.  Besides  the  size,  securing  ﬁ nance 
rests  on  the  prospects  of  achieving  a  return  on 
the capital, which should be sufﬁ cient to cover the 
level of risk involved. One such type of model that 
can be considered is the build, operate, own, and 
transfer  (BOOT)  model,  which  could  be  backed 
by the international lending agencies (Box 1).
Development of large hydropower plants 
Till now, the development of large power plants in 
Bhutan was ﬁ nanced through a mix of loans and 
grants. For accelerated development, other means 
of  developing  large  hydropower  plants  would  be 
required.  Hydropower  plants  on  IPP  mode  can 
also  be  developed  with  the  help  of  public  and

BUILD, OPERATE, OWN, AND TRANSFER MODEL
A build, own, operate, and transfer, or BOOT, model is a funding model that involves a single organization or 
period of time and then transferring this ownership across to an agreed party. The BOOT schemes are increasingly 
becoming  a  popular  means  of  fi nancing  large-scale  infrastructure  development  such  as  roads,  bridges,  and 
hydro dams in Australia and developing countries. An example in this respect is the 210 MW  Theun-Hinboun 
Hydropower Project in Lao PDR, which developed in joint venture between the Government of Laos (GoL) and 
the private sector. The Laos government’s state-owned electricity utility,  Electricité du Laos (EdL), owns 60% 
of  the  project  and  the  investment  in  the  project  is  largely  fi nanced  by  a  loan  of  $60  million  from  the  Asian 
Development Bank (ADB). The ownership of the remaining 40% share of the project is split equally between the 
Thai company MDX Lao and Nordic Hydropower, a partnership organization owned by the Swedish government 
public utility. The total cost of the project is $240 million. It is being fi nanced and developed as a BOOT venture 
that would see the project transferred back to the government in 30 years. The Theun-Hinboun Power Company, 
or THPC, is running this joint venture project.

private  partnerships  or  foreign  direct  investment 
(FDI).  The  private  investment  as  well  as  FDI 
would  depend  on  the  viability  of  the  projects  as 
well as policies and regulations in the power sector. 
The viability of these plants will, in turn, depend 
on their cost of generation. A ﬁ nancial analysis to 
estimate the generation cost for such power plant 
was  carried  out  using  lifecycle  cost  approach,  as 
explained subsequently. Since the revenue of these 
IPP would be in Ngultrum or in Indian rupees, an 
arrangement could be worked out for the import 
of the required equipment  from India.
  Large  hydropower  projects  are  developed 
primarily  for  exporting  power  to  India,  with 
certain percentage of power reserved for domestic 
consumption.

An  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  Chamkarchu

methodology’  issued  by  the  BEA. The  details  of 
the analysis are given in Annexure 4.1. The analysis 
shows that the cost of generation is Nu 1.73/kWh. 
The implementation of the present policy of reserving 
15%  generation  for  domestic  consumption  at  Nu 
0.3/kWh and export of rest of power at Nu 2.0/kWh 
shows that the generation is ﬁ nancially viable, with 
return on equity more than 15%. Thus, the present 
policy  of  promoting  large  hydropower  plants  that 
export power and also provide power for domestic 
consumption  at  subsidized  rate  can  be  continued. 
If there are major changes in the ﬁ nancing terms, 
then the strategy may have to be reworked, that is, 
the  rate  at  which  power  is  sold  for  domestic  use 
would  have  to  be  adjusted  to  make  the  projects 
viable. The analysis carried out was on completely 
commercial  basis,  that  is,  without  any  grant. With 
economic viability of the large hydropower plants, 
that is, they continue exporting power to India, these 
power plants can also be developed on IPP or FDI 
mode.  Another  option  is  developing  these  plants 
on BOOT mode.  As explained earlier, equipment 
imports could be facilitated from India to take care 
of hard currency issue.

Development of medium-capacity hydropower 
plants
In  addition  to  large-capacity  plants,  there  exists 
large  potential  for  medium-capacity  (up  to  100 
MW)  hydropower  plants.  The  Power  Systems 
Master  Plan  has  identiﬁ ed  about  36  plants  of 
capacity up to 100 MW, as shown in Table 4.
  An  analysis  of  the  small-  and  medium-sized 
hydropower plants was carried out to examine the 
viability  of  promoting  such  plants  in  IPP  mode 
with  private  sector  investments  and  as  captive 
hydropower plant for energy-intensive industries.

  These  power  plants  can  be  studied,  primarily, 
for the expected capital cost and annual generation, 
and can be offered to the private sector developers 
with  private  investment  (domestic  or  foreign), 
since the total investments (about Nu 60 million 
per MW) are not very large, and the private sector 
can look at the option of establishing such plant.

Case study III: Development of medium-
capacity hydropower plants in captive mode
The  medium-capacity  hydropower  plants  could 
also  be  used  for  captive  generation  by  industries. 
Private  sector  companies  interested  in  setting  up 
energy-intensive  industry  would  look  at  these 
medium-sized  plants  as  captive  power  generation 
units  to  ensure  enough  power  supply  round  the 
year.  This  scenario  was  analysed  for  medium-
capacity  hydropower  plants. The  assumptions  are 
same  as  in  the  case  of  the  analysis  of  medium-
capacity power plants. The analysis shows that the 
cost  of  generation  is  higher  for  medium-capacity 
hydropower plants in full commercial mode, that is, 
without any capital grants. The cost of generation 
is  about  Nu  1.88/kWh,  which  is  higher  than  the 
present tariff paid by the industry. Thus, it would 
not  be  viable  for  industries  to  invest  in  medium-
capacity hydropower plants for captive generation. 
However,  as  the  cost  of  generation  is  lower  than 
the export price, the medium-capacity hydropower 
plants should be promoted as captive power plants 
by  providing  capital  grant  or  subsidy. The  capital 
subsidy would make the generation cost comparable 
to the present high voltage tariff. In such a scenario, 
if the industries invest in captive generation, then 
equivalent  power  would  be  available  for  exports. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  capital  grant 
of 40% of project cost brings the generation cost 
down to Nu 1.2/kWh, which is the present tariff for 
industry. Thus,  with  generation  costs  comparable 
with  present  high  voltage  tariff,  the  industries 
could become interested in setting up captive small 
hydropower units. Further, as the cost of generation 
includes 14% return on equity, making additional 
investment  in  captive  generation  by  the  industry 
is  also  a  viable  option. Table  5  shows  the  cost  of 
generation  at  different  levels  of  subsidy.  Detailed 
calculations are given in Annexure 4.1.

The cost of generation, estimated as per the BEA 
methodology  for  tariff  estimation,  for  medium-
capacity hydropower power projects works out to 
be  about  Nu  1.68/kWh,  since  the  capital  as  well 
as  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  per 
megawatt of installed capacity for these plants are 
higher than the large hydropower plants. With the 
present domestic tariff, it will not be viable for the 
IPP to sell 15% power for domestic use at Nu 0.3/
kWh. In that case, the sale price for the rest 85% 
becomes higher than the export price to get 14% 
return on equity. The IPPs can sell up to 10% of 
power at 0.3 Nu/kWh for domestic consumption 
and sell/export the rest of power at export rate to 
get 14% return on equity. 
  Thus, the IPPs would be viable with this model, 
that  is,  domestic  sale  of  10%  generation  at  Nu 
0.3/kWh and rest exported/sold at export price. 
  This  analysis  assumes  9%  interest  rate.  Any 
upward  change  in  the  interest  rate  would  affect 
the viability of the medium-capacity power plants. 
For  example,  the  analysis  with  12%  interest  rate 
shows that the generation cost reaches about Nu 
1.86. With  this  generation  cost,  it  would  not  be 
viable for the IPP to sell any power at subsidized 
rate of Nu 0.3 /kWh.

export  to  Bhutan  will  be  another  issue,  as  India 
itself  is  a  power-deﬁ cit  country. To  address  this 
issue, the Bhutan Power Corporation, along with 
the  Department  of  Energy  (DoE),  is  regulating 
the allotment of power to industries. The licensing 
to  the  industries  has  been  done  considering  the 
availability  of  ﬁ rm  power. This  policy  deals  with 
the  demand  side  management.  On  the  supply 
side, the options for augmenting power generation, 
more importantly, the ﬁ rm power availability, are 
accelerated development of large as well as small 
hydropower  plants.  As  large  power  plants  have 
longer time of construction, development of small- 
and  medium-capacity  hydropower  plants  may  be 
undertaken. The private/foreign participation may 
be encouraged, as discussed in the earlier section. 
Since the run-of-the-river hydropower plants will 
have  seasonal  variations,  there  would  be  limited 
improvement in the availability of ﬁ rm power. The 
options  for  improving  the  ﬁ rm  power,  therefore, 
could include the following.

From the government’s perspective, by providing, 
say,  35%  grant,  the  beneﬁ t  would  be  in  terms  of 
having  surplus  energy,  which  could  be  exported 
at  a  price  of  Nu  1.85–2/kWh. Thus,  against  the 
expenditure  of  35%  grant,  there  is  additional 
income  through  higher  exports.    A  conservative 
estimate shows about 40% rate of return through 
export  of  power  against  35%  expenditure  as 
subsidy  for  captive  plants.  Here  the  assumption 
is  that  any  amount  of  energy  can  be  exported 
at  any  point  of  time  at  ﬁ xed  export  rate. This  is 
possible since the Government of India has agreed 
to  buy  power  up  to  10  000-MW  capacity  under 
the umbrella agreement.

thus, the cost of generation 
is  also  higher.  An  analysis 
was carried out to study the 
economic  viability  of  the  Sankosh  Hydropower 
Plant under present policies and export price. The 
results of the analysis are as follows.
Seasonal variation, energy security, and power 
plant development
As  all  hydropower  plants  in  Bhutan  are  ‘run-
of-the-river’  type,  the  power  generation  has  a 
very  high  seasonal  variation.  In  winter  season, 
hydropower  generation  drops  to  almost  20%  of 
its installed capacity. Thus, there is a critical issue 
of availability of ﬁ rm power. After commissioning 
of  Tala  Hydropower  Plant,  the  available  ﬁ rm 
power has reached about 253 MW. Based on the 
projected  energy  demand  by  the WRMP  (2004), 
it must be noted that in case no new hydropower 
plants  are  developed  soon  after  Tala,  the  peak 
supply  capacity  in  winter  months  will  fall  short 
of  projected  peak  power  requirements.  In  such  a 
situation, Bhutan would have to resort to power cuts 
or power imports from India, which would impact 
the  country’s  export  earnings  from  electricity 
sale. Further, whether India has surplus power to 
Medium-sized (@100-
MW capacity) plants 
can be promoted 
through IPP or

schemes for grid energy storage. Barring industrial

POWER GENERATION USING RENEWABLE ENERGY 
In Bhutan, renewable and non-conventional energy 
sources  like  solar,  wind,  biomass,  and  municipal 
solid waste can be harnessed for power generation. 
The power generation through these sources would 
provide  diversity  in  the  power  portfolio,  which 
presently  consists  mainly  of  the  hydro  resources. 
The  power  generation  from  biomass  could  be  a 
viable  option,  given  high  forest  cover  in  Bhutan. 
Sources like sun and wind could also supplement 
power  generation. These  technologies  could  also 
be used for decentralized power generation. Given 
the resource availability, the option for generating 
power  from  biomass  in  a  centralized  mode  and 
using wind and solar photovoltaics in off-grid mode 
could  be  explored.  Similarly,  utilizing  municipal 
solid  waste  for  energy  generation  can  also  help 
in  addressing  issues  related  to  viable  disposal 
and  management  of  ever-increasing  solid  waste 
in  Bhutan’s  urban  centres. A  detailed  analysis  of 
renewable energy options for power generation is 
provided in the subsequent sections.
Wheeling charges

0.2 Nu/unit
The cost of generation, estimated as per the BEA 
methodology  for  tariff  estimation,  for  reservoir 
hydropower  projects  works  out  to  be  about  1.56 
Nu/kWh,  since  the  capital  and  O&M  costs  are 
higher  than  those  of  large  hydropower  plants. As 
a  result,  the  generation  cost  is  higher. With  the 
higher generation cost and the policy of reserving 
15%  of  generation  for  domestic  consumption  at 
0.30 Nu/unit, the storage hydropower plants may 
not be economically viable. To make them viable, 
the limit for the sale of power at Nu 0.3/units may 
have to be reduced. This is desirable, as such power 
plants would provide much needed ﬁ rm power in 
winter  months. The  analysis  is  done  without  any 
grant  component;  if  any  grant  is  made  available, 
the generation cost would reduce accordingly. 
  At this stage, it is appropriate to look at the other 
renewable energy options for power generation to 
reduce dependence on hydropower.
Development of pump storage schemes
Pumped  storage  hydroelectricity  is  a  type  of 
hydroelectric  power  generation  used  for  load 
balancing. In a pumped storage plant, the energy 
is stored in the form of water, pumped from a lower 
elevation  reservoir  to  higher  elevation. This  is  an 
effective  way  of  storing  energy  during  the  periods 
Alternatives to hydropower
It is advisable to enhance the diversity of resources 
for electricity generation, and since the next major 
hydropower plant of the country, Punatsangchu I, 
would be operational only in 2015, it is essential to 
look at the options to augment the current power 
generation  capacity  by  promoting  and  exploring

other  renewables  such  as  biomass,  solar,  and 
wind. 
  Under  the  proposed  strategy  to  develop  other 
energy  resources  for  both  electrical  power  and 
thermal  energy  generation,  an  analysis  of  other 
renewable,  non-conventional,  and 
fuel 
resources has been carried out. This analysis aims 
at  giving  a  holistic  view  of  the  energy  resources 
and supply position. The overall objectives are as 
follows.

In  recent  times,  biomass  fuels  are  increasingly

energy  carriers  with  higher  caloriﬁ c  value  (such 
as pellets, briquettes, bio-diesel, and biogas) and/
or  are  used  in  the  efﬁ cient  equipment  (such  as 
improved cook stoves and gasiﬁ ers). This usage is 
collectively termed as ‘modern’ bioenergy. 
  The modern bioenergy has been playing small 
but increasingly signiﬁ cant role in recent times. It 
assumes  greater  signiﬁ cance  in  several  countries 
and  economic  sectors,  especially  in  well-forested 
countries with large forestry-based industries and/
or the countries with cold winters and large space 
heating demands (ESMAP 2005). For example, in 
Finland and Sweden, modern bioenergy accounts 
for 33%–36% of total energy used by the industry 
sector,  of  which  11%–12%  of  energy  is  used  for 
electricity generation,  combined heat and power 
(CHP) generation, and district heating (IEA 2002, 
2003a).  Interest  in  modern  bioenergy  has  been 
increasing worldwide. It is increasingly occupying 
centrestage in renewable energy plans and policies, 
especially in the developing countries, because of 
myriad practical, social, and economic advantages 
that it offers.

BIOENERGY
Bioenergy  (biomass  energy)  refers  to  the  use  of 
plant and other organic materials to provide desired 
forms of energy and energy services such as heat, 
light/electricity, and motive power. Bioenergy has 
been  a  primary  source  of  energy  since  human 
civilizations discovered ﬁ re. Even today, bioenergy 
accounts  for  about  11%  of  the  world’s  total 
primary energy supply of 420 exajoules (EJ) a year 
(ESMAP  2005).  Forest-based  biomass  has  been 
the  main  source  of  energy  in  Bhutan  for  many 
centuries. Abundantly and freely available biomass 
has become the natural choice for fuel for the rural 
population of Bhutan. 
  Bioenergy  has  been  reviewed  brieﬂ y  in  the 
following  sections    so  as  to  develop  a  deeper 
understanding  of  this  form  of  energy.  Some 
bioenergy-related 
issues  are  also  highlighted 
(Box 2).
  Biomass largely consists of unreﬁ ned fuels that 
are used in a traditional way, such as solid biomass 
used in traditional cook stoves for cooking, water 
heating, and space heating.

BIOENERGY-RELATED ISSUES
Bioenergy  has  its  own  limitations.  Bioenegry  activities  are  labour-,  land-,  and  resource-intensive.  Bioenergy 
activities directly aff ect communities. Most importantly, supply side activities set bioenergy apart from other 
renewable energy resources that are freely available. In contrast, bioenergy resources must be grown, harvested, 
gathered, and transported to the energy conversion plant, sometimes from large number of dispersed suppliers. 
These must be stored, dried, and/or processed – chopped or pelletized – for using them as biofuel (Energy Sector 
Management Assistance Program [ESMAP] 2005). While supply chain activities can bring substantial benefi ts 
in the form of local employment and income, they may also raise serous problems like competitive land use 
and labour system, which form the backbone of rural economies. This necessitates the need for evaluating the 
impacts of bioenergy project on rural employment and the environment. The risk to existing biomass-dependent 
social groups or activities should also be taken into account. 
  The ESMAP study has identifi ed seven main areas of particular importance to bioenergy project development, 
as listed below.
1  Resource  competition  Most  biofuels  have  other  uses  as  well.  So,  biofuels  may  face  price  competition. 
Competition  with  nonmonetized  traditional  biomass  supplies  that  provide  essential  ‘survival’  energy  is 
common and must be dealt with at early stages of project planning.
2  Land competition  Energy plantation may compete for land with other plantations or other uses. 
3  Land intensity  Bioenergy  plants  are  highly  land  intensive.  For  example,  they  typically  require  roughly  100 
times more land than solar photovoltaics to produce same amount of electricity. This physically limits the 
feasibility of bioenergy systems. 
4  Labour intensity 
5  Handling requirements   Bioenergy fuels are relatively bulky and need infrastructure to handle. 
6  Environmental concerns  Biomass systems, if not well designed, can have adverse impacts on soil quality, water 
resources, biodiversity, and landscape.
7  Supply uncertainty and risks
Use of liquid biofuels
Liquid  biofuels  such  as  straight  vegetable  oils 
(SVO) and bio-diesel are currently being explored 
as alternatives to petroleum fuels, especially for the 
transport sector. However, in case of Bhutan, these 
fuels will have limited role to play due to limited 
land available for cultivation. In Bhutan, only about 
7% of the land is under cultivation. The rest of the 
land has forest cover. Wasteland constitutes a very 
small  area,  and  hence,  bio-oil-bearing  plantation 
for  bio-diesel  production  will  have  direct  conﬂ ict 
with food security and agriculture production.
  Biomass fuels,2 primarily sourced from forests, 
play a vital role in the economy of Bhutan, as they 
are  the  main  energy  source  for  a  large  number 
of  rural  enterprises,  apart  from  majority  of 
households  in  the  rural  and  urban  areas  of  the 
country. The  country  consumed  about  724  000 
tonnes of ﬁ rewood during 2005, which accounted 
for almost 57% of the total primary energy supply. 
With the sustainable yield for timber and fuelwood 
estimated at 1 565 540 tonnes/year, biomass would 
continue to remain an important source of energy 
for Bhutan. 
Biomass-based power generation
Biomass-based power generation – either through 
direct  combustion  or  through  gasiﬁ cation  route 
– is an established technology worldwide.  Further, 
with  the  hydropower  generation  being  seasonal 
in  Bhutan,  biomass-based  power  generation  can 
provide an option to increase the power generation 
capacity for continuous power generation. Besides, 
biomass used for power generation can contribute

residues, animal manure, so on.

for  larger  thermal  applications  like  institutional 
cooking,  while  the  biomass/saw  dust  briquettes 
can  be  used  with  efﬁ cient  heating  devices.  A 
description of the biomass densiﬁ cation technology 
is given in Annexure 4.3, and biomass gasiﬁ cation 
technologies  and  their  thermal  applications  are 
brieﬂ y discussed in Annexure 4.4.
  The  success  of  the  sawdust  briquetting  plant 
operated by the Forest Development Corporation 
Ltd  (FDCL)  indicates  the  potential  for  the  use 
for  thermal 
of  biomass/saw  dust  briquettes 
applications.  In this regard, the DoE can develop a 
programme for sawdust and biomass briquetting in 
the Tenth Plan. The small-sized sawdust briquetting 
in  combination  with  individual  sawmills  could 
immediately  go  onstream.  This  programme  can 
include the promotion of efﬁ cient cooking/heating 
appliances.  
to  fuel  diversity. Therefore,  it  is  suggested  that  a 
5-MW biomass-based power plant be installed as 
a demonstration plant. Based on the operation of 
this demonstration plant, the DoE can further plan 
for  additional  biomass-based  power  generation. 
The  proposed  5-MW  biomass-based  power 
plant  can  be  supported  by  energy  plantation  to 
ensure sustainable fuel supply. A detailed techno-
economic analysis of such a plant is presented in 
Annexure 4.2. Salient features of 5-MW biomass-
based power plant are as follows.
Capital cost
Nu 225 million
Fuel consumption
2 kg/kWh
Biomass required
15 000 tonnes/year
Electricity production

Off-grid power generation using biomass
The small-scale biomass gasiﬁ er is an established 
technology, wherein the producer gas produced in 
the  gasiﬁ er  can  be  used  for  various  applications, 
including  power  generation. The  locally  available 
biomass  can  be  used  for  decentralized  power 
generation using biomass gasiﬁ ers. These biomass-
gasiﬁ er-based  power  plants  can  be  deployed  in 
remote  off-grid  locations.  It  is  suggested  that 
ﬁ ve  biomass-gasiﬁ er-based  decentralized  power 
plants  for  rural  electriﬁ cation  be  established  as 
demonstration projects on priority. Typically, these 
plants have capacities ranging from 5 kW to 100 
kW  and  can  be  established  for  supplying  grid-
quality power for a village or groups of villages.   
Pelletization
Pelletization is now a well-established technology 
in  Europe.  Pellets  are  produced  from  various 
raw  materials  like  agro-waste,  sawdust,  and  pine 
needles. Pellets are easy to handle and transport, 
and  advanced  automatic  pellet  stoves  and  space 
heaters  have  made  pellets  simple  and  efﬁ cient  to 
use. The Renewable Energy Division of the DoE 
can take up a feasibility study on adopting pellet 
technology in Bhutan. With vast areas under pine 
and  other  forests,  pellet  manufacturing  from 
forest waste can substantially reduce the demand 
for fuelwood for space heating in both urban and 
rural areas. 
  Similarly,  demonstration  of  biomass  gasiﬁ er 
for thermal application like institutional cooking, 
cardamom drying, and lemon grass oil extraction 
can be taken up in the Tenth Plan.

development of wind farms is still constrained by 
various issues, as discussed subsequently.

Infrastructure development
Road  and  power  evacuation  infrastructure  is  yet 
to be developed. Typically, wind machines of large 
capacities are installed on 50–80-m-high tower, and 
wind generator blades are typically 20–30 m long. 
Current road infrastructure may not be adequate 
to transport these blades and heavy machinery.
Solar PV wafer and cell production unit
Solar PV wafers, which are used to produce solar cells, 
are produced from raw silica/sand using energy-
intensive process mostly using electricity. Since Bhutan 
has cheap and renewable hydro energy in abundance, 
use of hydro energy for manufacturing solar PV wafers/
cells can be an interesting application to produce ‘green 
solar cells’. Some solar cell manufacturers have shown 
interest in this concept. Installation of such a plant in 
this region can bring down the cost of solar PV cells and 
systems substantially, making them cost-eff ective.
Public opinion about wind machines
During  the  discussions  with  ofﬁ cials  and  policy-
makers,  it  was  found  that  there  were  certain 
reservations  on  the  installation  of  large  wind 
machines due to the concerns about natural beauty 
for which Bhutan is famous. 
1  Solar  systems,  which  include  solar  thermal 
systems such as water heating systems and solar 
photovoltaic systems. 
Small wind machines and water pumping 
wind mills
Bhutan, thus, can explore small wind machines of 
capacity  less  than  100  kW  and  mechanical  wind 
pumps to generate electricity in isolated locations 
for  scattered  households  and  can  use  water 
pumping mills for providing water for irrigation and 
drinking. A detailed technology write-up on small 
wind machines is presented in Annexure 4.5.
  Small wind machines can also be coupled with 
solar photovoltaic power plants in hybrid mode to 
generate electricity for small villages. These isolated 
and distributed power generation technologies can 
play an important role in reducing time and cost 
of extending infrastructure to supply electricity to 
far-ﬂ ung areas. These minigrids can be connected 
to main grid, once the grid is established. 
2  Solar passive systems for building heating.
Various  solar  technologies  are  being  developed 
worldwide,  and  various  products  are  available 
in  the  market.  Few  systems  such  as  solar  home 
lighting  systems  and  solar  water  heating  systems 
are  useful  for  distributed  applications  in  the 
residential sector. These are discussed in detail in 
the next chapter.
Solar photovoltaic for power generation
Solar photovoltaic technologies are expensive but 
can be considered as an alternative for electricity 
production.  Grid-connected  solar  photovoltaic 
plants  of  few  hundred  kilowatt  capacities  are 
generally  cheaper.  Currently,  solar  photovoltaic 
power generation costs are in the range Nu 15–30/
kWh, depending on the site, technology, and size of 
the plant. These costs are, thus, very high compared 
to hydropower generation costs unless the cost of 
grid  extension  as  well  as  low  capacity  utilization 
of this infrastructure are also taken into account. 
However, solar photovoltaic is an excellent option 
for  distributed  generation,  since  solar  resource  is 
freely  available;    systems  are  modular,  stationary, 
and  easy  to  install;    there  are  no  moving  parts, 
and O&M is cheaper. Hence, the technology can 
be considered on demonstration basis by installing 
plants of, say, 100-kW capacity. Currently, under 
the  Integrated  Energy  Management  Master  Plan 
(IEMMP) project, the DoE has planned to install

region  under  Solar  and  Wind  Energy  Resource 
Assessment  (SWERA)  project  of  the  United 
Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP)  have 
shown  a  resource  potential  of  4.5–5  kWh/m2  in

for small-scale distributed power generation using 
hydrogen.   The  Ministry  of  New  and  Renewable 
Energy,  Government  of  India,  has  recently 
announced  an  ambitious  project  that  envisages 
introducing  10  million  two-  and  three-wheelers 
running on hydrogen in India.  The Government 
of India and the RGoB can take up a joint project 
to explore hydrogen production using hydropower 
and/or wind energy. This would be a major step in 
enhancing energy security for Bhutan.
  Recently, Young  and  others    have  published  a 
paper,  which  considers  the  use  of  hydrogen  as 
storage media for hydropower plants in Bhutan.  
The  paper  discusses  the  feasibility  of  generating 
hydrogen  using  excess  electricity  available  from 
Sengor  Hydropower  Plant.   The  paper  estimates 
the  total  cost  of  system  (including  100-kW 
hydropower  plant  at  a  cost  of  $190  000)  to  be 
$1424 775. Besides Sengor project, the paper also 
discusses various options for unelectriﬁ ed Thanza 
Hamlet. 
  Sengor  Power  Plant  is  now  operational,  and 
it  has  a  potential  to  generate  876  000  kWh  per 
annum. The plant has connected load of capacity 
20 kW. Currently, only about 100 000 kWh is likely 
to be used in a year (Box 3). It would be interesting 
to  consider  hydrogen  technology  options  in  near 
future. The Renewable Energy Division of the DoE 
can  look  at  this  option  as  futuristic  technology 
development,  and  a  donor-assisted  project  can 
be  initiated  to  study  the  hydrogen  production 
and storage option for future, in conjunction with 
hydropower plants.

kWp capacity as demonstration project. 
HYDROGEN AS ALTERNATIVE ENERGY CARRIER 
CUM STORAGE
Hydrogen is emerging as a clean energy carrier in 
recent  times. Though  hydrogen  technologies  are 
still in development and testing phase, considering 
the thrust and importance given to the research and 
development for developing hydrogen technologies, 
it is expected that hydrogen can become a major 
energy  carrier  and  energy  storage  option  in 
coming years. If generated from renewable energy 
resources such as sun, wind, and water, hydrogen 
generation is pollution free. Hydrogen is also being 
considered as a viable fuel for the transport sector, 
which  so  far  is  heavily  dependent  on  petroleum 
fuels  such  as  diesel,  petrol,    liqueﬁ ed  petroleum 
gas (LPG), and natural gas.  
   Hydrogen  can  be  used  directly  as  a  fuel  in 
modiﬁ ed internal combustion engines or turbines, 
either  in  mixed  fuel  mode  or  as  a  single  fuel. 
Another  technology  being  developed  is  hydrogen 
fuel cell technology. Fuel cells are electrochemical 
devices  that  produce  electricity  from  externally 
supplied  fuel  (hydrogen)  and  oxidant  (oxygen). 
Wind and hydropower technologies are currently 
being  evaluated  in  the  US,  European  countries, 
Japan, and other countries as electricity sources that 
could enable the production of large quantities of 
low-cost renewable hydrogen for use in distributed 
generation  and  transportation. This  will  facilitate 
the  use  of  hydrogen  storage  for  off-peak  storage 
of  hydropower.  In  the  context  of  Bhutan,  where 
hydropower is abundantly available but suffers from 
seasonal variations, hydrogen can be considered as 
a storage medium to store hydroelectricity, which 
is  environment-friendly.  Although  wind  power  is 
not being utilized for the commercial production 
of electricity, in near future, wind energy resources 
can  also  be  exploited  for  decentralized  electricity 
and  hydrogen  production.  By  2020,  smaller-
scale  stand-alone  and/or  grid-connected  systems 
serving local transportation ﬂ eets and distributed 
power  generation  schemes  can  be  envisaged.  
Indian  research  organizations  have  developed 
hydrogen-powered motorcycles and generator sets 
It is recommended that a project, which would 
evaluate  a  realistic  path  for  hydrogen  production 
and  storage  from  these  two  renewable  energy 
resources  –  water  and  hydrogen  –  be  taken  up 
as  a  ﬁ rst  step.   This  project  could  also  examine 
how to integrate this technology in nation’s energy 
infrastructure, if found feasible. 
 
Geothermal energy
Geothermal  energy  is  the  heat  energy  available 
in  the  core  of  the  earth.  The  exploitation  of 
geothermal  energy  to  meet  heat  requirements 
and/or  produce  electricity  is  common  in  certain 
countries like Iceland, USA, and the Philippines.

•  Department of Energy, Ministry of Trade and Industry (presently Ministry of Economic Aff airs)
Goals
•  Adequate and reliable supply of electricity for the next 20 years for the Sengor Community.
•  Reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by using hydropower energy instead of burning fossil fuels, 
which emits GHGs.
Objective 
•  To enhance livelihoods
•  To alleviate poverty
•  To stimulate socio-economic development
•  To encourage community-based rural enterprises
Project features
•  Sengor is located in the Thrumshingla National Park area and the extension from the available nearest grid is 
not environment-friendly. Therefore, there is a need for a stand-alone 100-kW micro hydro system.
•  Duration of the project: August 2005–June 2008.
•  The total cost for Sengor Micro Hydropower Demonstration Project is $1 065 000.00.
•  Community-based  micro  hydropower  project  in  which  the  community  will  take  the  full  responsibility  for 
operation, maintenance, electricity pricing, and bill collection, along with ensuring the sustainability of the 
micro hydro plant in the long run.  This will enhance their livelihoods and create a sense of ownership.
•  The project will benefi t about 57 households, which include the community, social institutions, and national 
workforce.  Moreover, the project is also expected to benefi t daily highway commuters.
  The  study  included  analysing  soil  and  water 
sample,  studying  geology  around  the  area,  and 
collecting information on medicinal properties of 
the thermal springs, besides registering medicinal 
plants en route. 
  The study report mentions that the temperature 
of  the  spring  water  ranges  between  40  °C  and 
50 °C. Highest temperature of 50 °C was recorded 
at  Chubu  Tsachhu,  which  is  located  in  North

Geothermal potential and its exploitation in 
Bhutan
Several hot springs (tsachhus) are known to exist in 
Bhutan. These occur in two regions—in northern 
Bhutan  at  Gasa,  Punakha,  upper  Trongsa, 
Bumthang,  and  Lhunetse  dzongkhags  and  in 
southern  Bhutan  at  Rongkhola  and  Bhurkhola. 
These  are  traditionally  used  for  bathing,  as  the 
water  is  believed  to  have  medicinal  and  healing 
properties.  In  1996,  a  reconnaissance  study  of 
thermal  springs  and  medicinal  water  springs 
(menchhus) in Gasa and Punakha Dzongkahg was 
carried  out  by  the  Geology  and  Mines  Division, 
Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industries  (Gyenden

In medium and long term, detailed exploration 
and plotting of thermal proﬁ les of the underground 
sources,  along  with  the  study  of  geological 
structures,  are  required  to  establish  the  potential 
and feasibility for the large-scale use of geothermal 
energy in the region for applications like electricity 
generation. These studies could be undertaken by 
the Department of Geology and Mines, along with 
the Renewable Energy Division of the DoE.   
  Further,  geological  study  and  exploration  of 
thermal  potential  for  direct  use  of  geothermal 
energy can be taken up in future.
 
Natural gas based combined cycle power plant
As evident from the analysis of the peak demand 
in Bhutan and the ﬁ rm power produced from the 
hydropower  plant,  there  will  be  a  gap  of  about 
250  MW  in  power  supply  during  lean  season 
till  2015  when  Punasangtchu  and  Mangdechu 
power  plants  will  get  commissioned. To  plug  the 
gap between the peak demand and power supply 
during the lean season of hydropower generation, 
a  natural  gas  based  combined  cycle  power  plant 
of an approximate capacity of 300 MW in Assam/
West  Bengal  is  recommended.  This  plant  may 
supply  power  to  India  during  the  summer,  and 
during  winter,  Bhutan  government  can  utilize  all 
the power generated from it. Salient features of the 
plant are as follows.
WASTE-TO-ENERGY
Waste  generation  is  increasingly  being  associated 
with  human  settlement  and  rapid  urbanization, 
with the problem of proper management of solid 
waste so generated also showing an upward trend. 
Thimphu  and  Phuentsholing  alone  generate 
about  37  tonnes  and  25  tonnes  of  solid  waste, 
respectively, daily, containing a lot of organic matter 
(Bhutan Energy Data Directory 2005). It has been 
estimated  that  in  Bhutan,  about  81  119  tonnes 
of solid waste is generated annually. If this waste 
can  be  used  for  the  generation  of  energy  (either 
for electricity generation or for supplying thermal 
energy), besides augmenting the energy supply per 
se, it would take care of waste management as well. 
Bhutan has, therefore, potential to sustain over 3 
MW of power generation capacity. 
  To  start  with,  a  biomethanation  system  of 
capacity 1 tonne/day may be set up in Thimphu as 
a  demonstration  plant,  treating  its  organic  waste, 
including that generated from hotels and vegetable

This project, which can be installed on the Indian 
side  as  a  joint  venture  will  offer  the  following 
advantages.
#
FOSSIL FUELS
In the absence of petroleum reserves in the country, 
Bhutan  meets  its  requirement  of  the  petroleum 
fuels – diesel, petrol, kerosene, and LPG – through 
imports from India.
Lean power shortage is eliminated.
Bhutan’s energy security issue is addressed due 
to  the  diversity  in  fuel  for  power  generation. 
Since  currently,  the  majority  of  electricity  is 
generated  by  two  hydropower  plants,  which

incidentally, are on same river and are run-of-
the-river type with limited storage.
Industries can pay higher charges during winter 
for assured power supply. 
Gas  power  plant  can  respond  faster  to  change 
in demand.
Natural  gas  being  a  relatively  cleaner  fuel,  the 
pollution impact is negligible. 
The gestation period is small (about two years); 
hence, it is a quicker and ideal solution 
the  main  source  of  power  in  Bhutan  for  a  long 
time  to  come.  However,  for  faster  development 
of  hydropower  plants,  involvement  of  the  private 
sector  as  equity  partner  or  IPP  or  captive  power 
producer  is  essential.  It  is  essential  to  develop 
small-  and  medium-sized  hydropower  plants  on 
fast  track  mode  so  as  to  avoid  power  shortages, 
especially  in  winter,  with  appropriate  incentives 
and ﬁ nancial packages for IPPs. 
  Other  renewables  can  play  an  important  but 
limited  role  in  electricity  generation.  However, 
the  establishment  of  demonstration  plants  using 
biomass,  small  wind,  solar  photovoltaic,  and 
municipal  solid  waste  should  be  considered  to 
develop diverse resources, distributed generation, 
and energy security. 
  Energy-intensive industries could be encouraged 
to  set  up  captive  power  plants  to  achieve  twin 
goal  of  employment  generation  and  industrial 
development  without  hampering  the  export  of 
electricity or supply of electricity to the citizens of 
the country.
  The  DoE  could  take  up  a  study  to  prepare 
detailed  feasibility  report  for  setting  up  a  solar 
photovoltaic silicon cell and wafer manufacturing 
industry in near future.  Hydrogen and geothermal 
energy can be explored as futuristic options. 
  The potential of biomass for thermal applications 
in  small-scale  industries  and  for  processing  agro 
products can also be explored.
  Cheap  and  renewable  hydroelectricity  can  be 
effectively  used  in  the  transport  sector,  which  is 
an environment-friendly option.
#
#
#
#
Only barrier for this project could be the availability 
of natural gas.
Coal
Coal  is  primarily  used  in  industries. The  overall 
contribution  of  coal  in  the  energy  supply  mix  is 
only  about  8%.  Efﬁ cient  technologies  for  coal 
utilization  can  be  promoted.  Locally  produced 
coal  is  mainly  used  for  reduction  processes  in 
the  industries.  Coal-based  power  plants  are  not 
envisaged for following reasons.
#
Locally  available  coal  is  of  poor  quality  and  is 
available in limited quantity. 
Large hydropower potential is available. 
A  coal  plant  may  be  useful  for  improving 
ﬁ rm  power,  but  it  is  not  essential  if  medium 
hydropower plants are installed in next four to 
ﬁ ve years.

CONCLUSION 
The  above  analysis  clearly  shows  that  being 
cheapest and pollution free, hydropower will remain

Demand side efficiency enhancement 
or energy demand management
Energy demand management or demand 
can be achieved by adopting one of the following 
strategies.
1  Improving the overall efﬁ ciency 
2  Using modern or renewable energy sources
3  Developing energy-efﬁ cient housings/buildings
side  efﬁ ciency  enhancement  strategies 
fundamentally  aim  at  optimizing  the 
use of energy delivered through end-use 
efﬁ ciency enhancement, demand side management 
practices, and reduction in waste and unnecessary 
use, thus substantially increasing the ‘net’ energy 
available to end-users. 
  Taking  clue 
the  projected  energy 
from 
consumption  and  predicted  fuel  mix  for  each 
sector, an attempt has been made to carry out an 
analysis, by sector, and prioritize various strategies 
for  demand  side  efﬁ ciency  enhancement,  along 
with  the  promotion  of  eco-friendly  fuels  and 
renewable energy resources so as to evolve a long-
term strategy.
Improvement in the overall efficiency
In  the  residential  sector,  the  improvement  in 
the  overall  efﬁ ciency  of  the  appliances  used  for 
cooking,  space  heating,  and  lighting  will  reduce 
the  fuel  consumption.  The  strategies  for  the 
improvement  in  the  overall  efﬁ ciency  in  the  fuel 
and energy consumption are as follows.
Strategy 1: Promotion of improved cook stove 
Goal
The main aim of this strategy is to reduce fuelwood 
consumption  for  cooking  and  space  heating  in 
rural households.
RESIDENTIAL SECTOR
The residential sector mainly consumes fuelwood, 
kerosene,  liqueﬁ ed  petroleum  gas  (LPG),  and 
electricity. 
  As discussed earlier, fuelwood accounts for more 
than 90% of the sector’s energy demand, and at the 
same time, fuelwood devices are hardly 10%–15% 
efﬁ cient.  Fuelwood  is  mainly  used  for  cooking, 
space heating, and lighting. Similarly, kerosene is 
the most widely used fuel for lighting purpose in 
the  residential  sector. According  to  Census  2005 
of Bhutan, about 46 064 households use kerosene 
for  lighting,  while  about  4502  households  use 
fuelwood,  candle  or  other  resources  for  lighting. 
Hence,  there  is  a  need  to  put  in  place  strategies 
for  cutting  down  fuelwood  as  well  as  kerosene 
consumption  in  this  sector.  Reduction  in  the 
consumption  of  fuelwood  and  kerosene  as  well 
as  in  the  total  residential  energy  consumption 
Approach 
Reduction in fuelwood consumption can be effected 
through  awareness  campaign  and  promoting 
fuel-efﬁ cient  cook  stoves  and  bukharis.  Eleven 
Dzongkhags – Dagana, Wangdue, Mongar, Tsirang, 
Haa, Trashiyangyse, Trashigang, Pemagatshel, and 
Sandrup  Jongkhar  –  that  have  highest  per  capita 
fuelwood consumption and house more than 48% 
of  the  rural  population  can  be  targeted  in  the 
Tenth Plan.
  Giving subsidized electric cook stoves can also 
be  considered  a  strategy  in  these  Dzongkhags. 
Most  of 
in 
these  Dzongkhags  are 
central  and  eastern  regions,  which  are  mostly 
underdeveloped.

DEMAND SIDE EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT OR ENERGY DEMAND MAN AGEMENT
Recommendations
A  programme  for  supplying  about  500–1000 
cook  stoves  on  demonstration  basis  can  be 
initiated  in  the  Tenth  Plan.  These  cook  stoves 
can  be  distributed  through  subsidy  programmes 
by  renewable  and  natural  resource  centres. The 
Agriculture Machinery Centre (AMC) can be the 
focal  agency  for  manufacturing  and  distribution 
of these stoves. 
  However,  given  the  fact  that  about  69  000 
households  (37%)  still  use  fuelwood  for  cooking 
and  space  heating,  it  is  important  to  have  an 
ambitious  programme  on  the  distribution  of 
efﬁ cient  cook  stoves  in  Bhutan.  The  United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) ofﬁ ce 
in  Bhutan  had  earlier  supported  improved  cook 
stove  programme,  but  such  activities  were  not 
supported on a long-term basis. It is important to 
carry  out  this  programme  on  a  sustainable  basis 
and for a longer period. 
Strategy 3: Promotion of CFLs, LED lamps, 
and other energy-efficient lighting fixtures in 
electrified areas
Compact  ﬂ uorescent  lamps  (CFLs)  are  efﬁ cient 
and effective in saving electricity used for lighting. 
Bhutanese  households  commonly  use  electric 
bulbs  for  lighting.  Replacement  of  these  bulbs 
with CFLs can save as much as 80% of electricity 
used for lighting. Apart from CFLs, new types of 
efﬁ cient tube lights and lighting systems based on 
light-emitting  diodes  (LED)  are  also  available  in 
the market. 
Recommendations
It is recommended that a target of about 20 000 
improved  cook  stove  installations  in  households 
can  be  set  under  the  programme.  A  nationwide 
awareness campaign can also be undertaken. 
  The  Department  of  Energy  (DoE)  can 
implement the programme with the help of NGOs 
such  as Tarayana  Foundation  and  Royal  Society 
for Protection of Nature (RSPN). 
in 
  Monitoring  of 
selected  villages  before  and  after  implementation 
can indicate the impact of the programme. 
fuelwood  consumption 
Goal
The main goal is to reduce the energy consumption 
in  the  electriﬁ ed  areas  by  introducing  energy-
efﬁ cient lighting systems. 
Strategy 2: Use of improved cook stoves for 
fodder cooking 
The Integrated Energy Management Master Plan 
(IEMMP)  survey  has  estimated  that  about  26% 
of the energy consumed in the residential sector is 
used for fodder cooking in rural areas. Most of the 
fodder  cooking  is  being  done  using  conventional 
three-stone cook stoves. 
  Since  fuelwood 
is  available  free  of  cost, 
alternative  fuels  such  as  LPG  or  electricity  were 
not used for fodder cooking activities.
Approach
One approach is the promotion of CFLs and energy-
efﬁ cient lighting through awareness campaign. For 
areas having off-grid hydropower plants, supply of 
CFLs  through  subsidy/cost  sharing  scheme  can 
also  be  considered.  Similar  experimental  scheme 
implemented  by  the  DoE  and  the  Bhutan  Power 
Corporation  (BPC)  in  Ura  Micro  Hydro  Power 
Project area in 2005 has shown good success.
Goal
Reduce fuelwood consumption for fodder cooking 
by improving efﬁ ciency.
Recommendations
In Thimphu/Phuentsholing and other urban areas, 
introduction  of  the  CFL  under  promotional 
scheme  for  replacing  bulb  can  be  undertaken  by 
the  BPC.  Certain  number  of  CFLs,  say  four  per 
households,  can  be  provided  to  each  consumer, 
and the cost of the same can be recovered through 
electricity bills. 
  Promotion of 36-watt tube light instead of 40-
watt  tube  lights  is  also  being  considered  under 
Approach 
Improved cook stoves can be supplied free of cost 
through  Dzongkhag  ofﬁ ces,  for  fodder  cooking. 
Specially designed turbo cook stoves developed by 
organizations  such  as The  Energy  and  Resources 
Institute (TERI) can be tried on a demonstration 
basis.

the  South  Asia  Regional  Initiative  for  Energy 
programmes. Similarly, schemes for promotion of 
energy-efﬁ cient lighting can also be taken up.
Use of modern fuel and renewable energy 
sources
Strategy 5: Use of briquettes and pellets for 
space heating
Briquettes made from saw dusts are now available 
in  Thimphu  region,  which  are  mainly  supplied 
through  briquetting  plant  set  up  by  the  Natural 
Resources  Development  Corporation  (NRDC). 
Similar briquetting plants can be installed at other 
places so that briquettes are available in most parts 
of  the  country.  Further,  small  pellets  made  from 
sawdust  and  forest  waste  can  be  used  for  space 
heating. Pellet manufacturing is a major industry 
in Europe, and sophisticated pellet stoves are also 
available.
Strategy 4: Promotion of efficient LPG stoves
LPG  is  a  modern  cooking  fuel,  causing  less 
pollution. It is an efﬁ cient burning fuel and is easy 
and convenient to use.
  Use of LPG as cooking fuel is common in urban 
areas.  However,  in  rural  areas,  LPG  is  still  not  a 
preferred fuel due to the following reasons. 
#
High  cost  mainly  due  to  high  transportation 
costs 
Limited availability 
Difﬁ culty in transporting it to the households. 
#
#
Goal 
Replacing fuelwood with LPG and efﬁ cient use of 
LPG by introducing efﬁ cient LPG cook stoves. 
Goal
The  strategy  is  to  reduce  fuelwood  consumption 
for space heating.
Approach 
Small LPG cylinders that are easy to transport can 
be introduced. Figure 1 depicts a woman carrying 
LPG  cylinder.  Simultaneously,  energy-efﬁ cient 
LPG cook stoves can also be introduced. 
Approach
Pellets and briquettes can be produced from saw 
dust and forest wastes. Pine needles and other forest 
waste  can  be  effectively  used  for  manufacturing 
pellets. 
Recommendations
It  is  expected  that  LPG  consumption  is  likely 
to  increase  by  three  to  four  times  by  2020. 
Introduction of standards and labelling system for 
LPG cook stove can help in introducing efﬁ cient 
Recommendations
Small-scale saw dust should be introduced along 
with  forest  waste  briquetting  and  pelletizing  in 
various towns of the country. Simultaneously, new 
energy-efﬁ cient  pellet  stoves  and  boilers  should 
also be introduced in towns.
Strategy 6: Promotion of solar lanterns and 
home lighting systems in unelectrified areas
Proper  lighting  is  the  basic  requirement  in  a 
modern  society.  It  is  not  only  important  from 
health point of view but is also essential for socio-
economic development, as it gives an opportunity 
to people to extend their working hours and also 
enables students to study for longer period. People 
can carry on with their day-to-day activities even 
after sunset.
   According to the Census 2005, there are about 
46 064 households that use kerosene as a primary

available  in  various  models  and  sizes. The  DoE 
has  been  working  with  some  organizations  like 
Barefoot  Engineer  College,  Tilonia,  India,  for 
training  rural  youth  in  installation  and  operation 
and maintenance (O&M) of these systems. About 
300  rural  women  were  trained  recently  under 
an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-funded 
programme. 
  Promotion  of  solar  lantern  and/or  solar  home 
lighting systems as an interim solution for lighting 
can be done in two ways. 
1  Direct  sale  Direct  sale  of  solar  lanterns  and 
home lighting systems to individual households 
under subsidy scheme can be promoted through

(BDFC)  or  Renewable  Natural  Resource 
(RNR) centres.

use fuelwood, candle or other resources for lighting.  
Figure  2  shows  the  percentage  use  of  fuels  for 
lighting purpose in households in Bhutan.
Goal
To reduce the use of imported kerosene as well as 
to reduce indoor pollution and provide improved 
lighting to rural unelectriﬁ ed households. 
Approach
Though  all  households  will  eventually  be 
covered  under  rural  electriﬁ cation  programme, 
an  immediate  and  intermediate  solution  can 
be  providing  solar  lighting  systems  and  solar 
lanterns. 
Recommendations
Solar lanterns are designed to provide quality light 
for  about  two  to  six  hours.  Solar  home  lighting 
systems  are  typically  designed  with  two  to  four 
CFL tube lights and an additional point for small 
radio or TV. 
  Both these products are commercially available 
in  the  international  and  local  markets. They  are

and small market size. 
mountainous  terrain  may  affect  the  efﬁ cacy  of 
such schemes. The Renewable Energy Division 
of the DoE is already in the process of training 
rural  women  on  solar  home  lighting  systems 
as  ‘barefoot  engineer’  from  Barefoot  College, 
Tilonia,  and  Rajasthan,  India.  These  women 
can be further trained to run small business of 
renting solar lantern. 
Recommendations
The  DoE  has  already  carried  out  initial  studies 
on  solar  water  heating  systems  for  institutional 
consumers. The  studies  have  established  the  fact 
that these systems are workable, but the costs are 
very high. Moreover, electricity and fuelwood – two 
most commonly used fuels for water heating – are 
very  cheap. Therefore,  following  suggestions  are 
made for promoting solar water heating systems. 
Initially,  solar  water  heating  systems  can  be 
#
promoted  in  urban  areas  through  awareness 
campaign. Special soft loans can be made available 
to interested users through the BDFC. 
The  DoE  may  also  offer  a  rebate  on  monthly 
electricity bills for those users who have installed 
solar water heating systems.
Similarly,  a  rebate  may  be  given  on  annual 
municipal/property  taxes  to  commercial  and 
institutional buildings with solar water heating 
systems.
Simultaneously,  the  use  of  kerosene  wick  lamps 
through  awareness 
should  be  discouraged 
campaign. 
  Solar  home  lighting  systems  are  already  being 
promoted  in  Bhutan  under  different  funding 
programmes.  Most  of  these  are  promoted  in 
rural  areas  that  fall  under  protected  forest  areas. 
Recently, proposed draft Renewable Energy Policy 
by  the  DoE  envisaged  supply  of  solar  home 
lighting  systems  to  3018  households  for  off-grid 
electriﬁ cation. The same scheme can be extended 
to the households in rural areas, where electricity is 
not likely to reach for another four to ﬁ ve years.
#
#
Strategy 7: Promotion of solar water heating 
systems
Water  heating  is  another  end  use  application  in 
Bhutan, which consumes a lot of energy. Water is 
heated mostly in kitchen or by using bukharis. 
  Solar  water  heating  systems  have  proved  their 
effectiveness  in  saving  electricity  and  other  fuels 
that are used for heating water. 
Specially  designed  smaller  and  lighter  systems 
using  plastics  can  be  installed  on  demonstration 
basis. 
Strategy 8: Use of hydrogen as a cooking fuel
In  future,  the  potential  of  hydrogen  production 
using  hydropower  to  store  surplus  hydro  energy 
can  be  explored.  A  pilot  study  and  a  pilot  plant 
for  hydrogen  production  and  storage  have  been 
suggested elsewhere in this report. Use of hydrogen 
for cooking can be explored at a later stage. Issues 
such  as  costs  and  safety  need  to  be  addressed 
before  this  technology  can  be  recommended  for 
large-scale  use.  Figure  3  shows  a  hydrogen  cook 
stove  developed  by  Banaras  Hindu  University, 
Varanasi.
  The  Ministry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy 
(MNRE), Government of India, has been funding 
research  programmes  on  hydrogen 
various 
technology development. Some of the technologies, 
such as hydrogen-based motorcycles, can be tested 
in Bhutan in future. 
Goal 
The main goal under this strategy is to introduce 
solar water heating systems to save electricity and 
fuelwood.
Approach
In Bhutan, initial studies carried out by the DoE 
through  Austrian  consultants  have  shown  that 
these systems may not be cost-effective. TERI team 
carried out an analysis of solar water heating system 
with  the  help  of  RETScreen  software  by  using 
cost  details  provided  by  the  local  solar  system 
supplier.  The  analysis  showed  that  subsidy  and 
soft  loans  are  required  for  making  solar  system 
attractive,  and  the  cost  of  transportation  and

  A  detailed  note  on  energy  conservation  in  the 
buildings  in  Bhutan  is  given  in  the  subsequent 
section.
Energy conservation in buildings in Bhutan
Design  concept  of  eco-housing  and  eco-friendly 
building ensures the following. 
#
Overall  site  planning  and  design  of  building 
architecture  have  coherence  and  integration 
with the surroundings.
All  buildings  are  oriented  and  designed  for 
energy  efﬁ ciency  and  use  natural  climatic 
conditions  to  reduce  energy  consumption  by 
adopting passive solar design concepts.
Conservation  and  efﬁ cient  use  of  natural 
resources such as rainwater available at site are 
ensured.
Renewable  energy  is  used,  such  as  using  solar 
energy for water heating and space heating, using 
biogas  for  cooking,  and  using  other  renewable 
energies, wherever applicable.
Eco-friendly,  low-embedded  energy  materials, 
and energy saving building materials are used.
Energy-efﬁ cient  technologies  and  appliances 
are  used  to  reduce  energy  consumption  in  the 
building.  For  example,  using  heat  pumps  for 
space  heating  and  cooling,  using  insulation  in 
walls and roofs for reducing heat loss, and using 
energy-efﬁ cient lighting ﬁ xtures.

#
Development of energy efficient housings/
buildings
Energy consumption for lighting and space heating 
can be reduced by using suitably designed houses 
and  buildings.  Eco-friendly  housing  designed  to 
reduce heat loss and use daylight for internal lighting 
is  effective  in  reducing  the  energy  consumption 
for  space  heating  and  lighting.  A  brief  note  on 
energy conservation techniques in the buildings is 
presented  in Annexure  5.1.  Following  strategy  is 
suggested  for  the  introduction  of  energy-efﬁ cient 
housing in Bhutan.
#
#
#
Strategy 9: To introduce energy-efficient 
housing in Bhutan
Goal
The  goal  of  this  strategy  is  to  introduce  energy-
efﬁ cient buildings in Bhutan.
Bhutan has developed its own traditional housing 
and  building  design  guidelines,  which  are  being 
followed strictly. 
  Traditionally,  locally  made  mud  bricks  and 
traditional housing construction techniques using 
bamboo  and  mud  are  still  used  in  rural  areas. 
However,  in  urban  areas,  the  practice  of  using 
cement  and  concrete  for  construction,  and  using 
galvanized iron (GI) sheets for rooﬁ ng material is 
prevalent.
Approach
The  energy-efﬁ cient  building  designs  can  be 
introduced  initially  for  new  housing  complexes 
being developed by government agencies
Recommendations
External  expert  agencies  can  be  initially  involved 
in developing designs. This can be simultaneously 
followed  by  organizing  capacity  building  training 
courses for architects and builders. The DoE can 
develop such courses jointly with the Government 
of India and government agencies like Bureau of 
Energy Efﬁ ciency (BEE).
In  the  context  of  Bhutan,  following  are  the 
recommendations  to  develop  and  adopt  eco-
friendly  and  energy-efﬁ cient  housing  codes  and 
concepts.
#
 
National-level  awareness  programmes  and 
capacity-building  programmes  for  common 
citizens and architects need to be developed.

$
Collaborative programmes with other agencies, 
especially with the government agencies like the 
BEE,  can  be  undertaken  to  develop  database 
for  weather  data,  best  practices,  design  norms 
for  Bhutanese  weather  conditions,  alternative 
materials, and so on. 
Materials  like  bamboo  and  mud  walls  need  to 
be analysed and documented.
The  use  of  bamboo  and  its  products  for 
buildings, such as mats for walls and bamboo-
based  rooﬁ ng  materials,  can  be  explored. 
Currently  used  GI  sheet  rooﬁ ng  material  can 
be replaced with bamboo mats. 
Workshops  for  architects  and  construction 
agencies to sensitize them on energy conservation 
and  energy  efﬁ ciency  in  buildings  should  be 
conducted.
Agencies  like  Standards  and  Quality  Control 
Authority 
(SQCA),  National  Housing 
Development  Corporation,  Construction 
Association  of  Bhutan,  National  Environment 
Commission,  Ministry  of  Works  and  Human 
and  Urban  Development 
Settlement, 
Department  can  work 
towards 
together 
developing energy-efﬁ cient buildings. 
Some  speciﬁ c  recommendations  that  can  be 
considered are as follows.
  Longer façades should face the north–south 
$
Inﬁ ltration  should  be  controlled  by  having 
concrete cornices for windows.
 
#
General recommendations
Since  capital  cost  of  energy-efﬁ cient/renewable 
energy  devices  is  a  major  barrier  in  adopting 
loan  scheme  for  energy-
them,  a  common 
efﬁ cient/renewable  energy  devices  can  be  taken 
into consideration. This loan scheme can provide 
loans  on  convenient  terms  to  individuals  for  the 
purchase  of  energy-efﬁ cient/renewable  energy 
devices  certiﬁ ed  by  the  DoE. Till  the  time  such 
labelling  facilities  are  developed  in  the  country, 
energy/star-labelled energy-efﬁ cient devices as well 
as  those  renewable  energy  systems  that  conform 
to international standards may be endorsed by the 
DoE for use in Bhutan.
  Small  isolated  houses  can  explore  small  wind 
machines  and  small  solar  photovoltaic  (PV) 
power  plants  for  providing  electricity  to  the 
households. Wind/solar hybrid pumps can be used 
in farmhouses.

lighting,  and  space  heating,  while  shops  and 
commercial ofﬁ ces use energy mostly for lighting, 
space  heating,  and  running  other  appliances  like 
computers  and  printers.  Most  commonly  used 
fuel in these sectors are fuelwood for cooking and 
water  heating,  mainly  by  bulk  users,  monastic 
bodies,  schools  and  hospitals,  and  so  on,  and 
electricity for lighting and heating, mainly by the 
hotel industries and commercial ofﬁ ces. Following 
paragraphs describe the strategies that can be used 
for the reduction in the demand for fuelwood and 
kerosene and can be helpful in saving electricity.

#
#
In  urban  areas  where  LPG  and  electricity  are 
available,  the  use  of  efﬁ cient  LPG  cook  stoves, 
and  electric  rice  cookers  and  curry  cookers  is 
recommended.
  Turbo  cook  stoves,  or  wood  gas  cook  stoves, 
can  be  introduced  in  the  institutional  segment. 
Canada 
(<http://www.

Promoting the use of energy-efficient 
appliances
Strategy 10: Use of energy-efficient cook 
stoves and other devices for cooking
Army  units,  monastic  bodies  situated  in  remote 
areas, and schools with hostels use fuelwood-based 
cook stoves for cooking.
stoves, 
  Wood-ﬁ red  water-jacketed 
commonly known as Althaps, which are produced 
locally,  are  found  to  be  used  in  many  places. 
These  were  developed  under  the  UNDP-funded

Strategy 11: Promotion of CFL and other 
energy-efficient lighting fixtures in 
commercial buildings
CFLs  are  efﬁ cient  and  effective 
in  saving 
electricity  that  is  used  for  lighting.  Commonly 
used  appliances  are  electric  bulbs  for  lighting. 
Replacement  of  these  bulbs  with  CFLs  can  save 
as  much  as  80%  of  electricity  used  for  lighting. 
Box 1 gives the comparison of an 11-W CFL and 
a 60-W incandescent lamp.
Goal
Goal  of  this  approach  is  to  promote  the  use  of 
energy-efﬁ cient cook stoves for these institutions.
Approach
Reduction  in  fuelwood  consumption  can  be 
encouraged  through  awareness  campaign  and 
promoting fuel-efﬁ cient cook stoves and bukharis. 
Goal
The  main  aim  is  to  reduce  energy  consumption 
in  the  commercial  and  institutional  sector  by 
introducing energy-efﬁ cient lighting systems. 
Recommendations
The  World  Wide  Fund  for  Nature  (WWF)  was 
recently  engaged  in  promoting  electric  rice  and 
curry cookers for institutional users. These cookers 
have  shown  good  potential  for  saving  fuelwood.

Use of modern fuel and renewable energy 
sources
Approach
One  approach  is  promoting  CFLs  and  energy-
efﬁ cient  lighting  through  awareness  campaign. 
Providing  CFLs  through  subsidy/cost-sharing 
scheme can also be considered. 
Strategy 13: Promotion of dish-type solar 
cookers
Dish-type  solar  cooker  may  be  promoted  in 
the  monastic  bodies,  schools/colleges  hostels, 
hotels,  and  so  on,  where  large-scale  cooking  is 
required. This will help in reducing the fuelwood 
consumption for cooking. 
Recommendations
In Thimphu/Phuentsholing and other urban areas, 
introduction  of  the  CFL  under  promotional 
scheme  for  replacing  bulb  can  be  undertaken 
under an appropriate programme launched by the 
DoE through a designated department. 
  Energy audit may be made compulsory for big 
hotels,  commercial  complexes,  and  institutions. 
This  will  motivate  the  users  to  switch  to  the  use 
of energy-efﬁ cient CFL lights and other electrical 
ﬁ xtures.
Strategy 14: Promotion of solar water heaters
Solar water heaters are the most useful devices for 
saving  fuelwood  as  well  as  electricity,  which  are 
being used for heating water in most of the hotels 
and institutions. These institutions can be provided 
with special incentives to install solar water heating 
systems  to  meet  their  hot  water  requirement. 
Although  there  are  hindrances  to  installing  solar 
water  heaters,  such  as  low  cost  of  electricity  and 
lack  of  required  infrastructure,  know-how,  and 
service  network,  the  DoE  can  promote  the  use 
of  solar  water  heaters  by  undertaking  awareness 
campaigns,  highlighting 
their  environmental 
beneﬁ ts,  providing  incentives  to  the  user,  and 
making them compulsory for large hotels.
Strategy 12: Introducing energy efficiency in 
the hotel industry
The hotel industry is an integral part of the tourism 
industry.  Energy  efﬁ ciency  measures  focused  on 
hotel industry would go a long way towards eco-
tourism and energy savings.
  Hotels in Bhutan vary from simple lodges to ﬁ ve-
star hotels built by international groups. Typically, 
hotels  in  Bhutan  have  about  20–30  rooms. The 
tourism  department  has  planned  to  develop  and 
upgrade facilities of the existing hotels to three- or 
four-star grade. 
  Use  of  energy-efﬁ cient  LPG  cook  stoves  and 
lighting  ﬁ xtures  will  reduce  the  total  energy 
demand of the hotels.
Strategy 15: Promotion of solar PV and small 
wind-based power plants 
Solar PV based power plants and small wind-based 
power  plants  may  be  promoted  in  institutions, 
especially  monasteries  and  schools.  This  will 
reduce the dependency on hydropower, especially 
in  winter  when  the  power  from  hydro  system 
become less. This solar PV and small wind-based 
plants  will  also  help  in  electrifying  the  rural  area 
where grid electricity has not reached.
Recommendations
#
Energy  auditing  can  be  made  mandatory  for 
hotels  having  a  minimum  of  20  rooms.  The 
DoE can provide the auditing support. 
These hotels can be asked to submit the details 
of energy consumption to the DoE on an annual 
basis. Over a period of time, norms for energy 
consumptions  can  be  developed  for  the  hotel 
industry. 
Hotels  can  be  encouraged  to  adopt  energy 
efﬁ ciency through star rating systems.
Development of energy-efficient buildings 
Energy  consumption  in  buildings  can  effectively 
be  reduced  by  suitably  designing  the  buildings. 
The  DoE  may  promote  the  development  of  eco-
friendly  buildings,  which  are  designed  to  reduce 
heat loss and use daylight for internal lighting.

Strategy 16: Introduction of energy efficient 
commercial buildings
Goal 
The  main  aim  of  this  strategy  is  to  introduce 
energy-efﬁ cient commercial buildings in Bhutan
Impact/energy saving potential
The  Long-range  Energy  Alternatives  Planning 
(LEAP)  analysis  has  shown  that  implementing 
these  measures  will  save  approximately  10%  of 
electricity in future. 
Implementation strategy
The DoE has established an energy laboratory under 
the IEMMP project. The laboratory facilities and 
the  infrastructure  available  with  the  Department 
of  Industries  on Training  and  Capacity  Building 
can be used to develop training and energy audit 
programmes for small-scale industries
  The programmes can be developed for speciﬁ c 
types  of  industries  such  as  textile,  paper,  food 
processing, and so on. 
Approach
New  ofﬁ ce  buildings  of  Royal  Government  of 
Bhutan can be made energy efﬁ cient on the lines 
of  the  new  building  of  the  DoE. This  design  can 
be extended to other institutions also.
Recommendations
An energy-efﬁ cient building code for Bhutan may 
be  developed,  and  it  should  be  incumbent  on 
hotels and big institutions buildings, including the 
commercial ofﬁ ce buildings, to follow this code as 
per  the  building  category. To  generate  awareness 
on these energy-efﬁ cient buildings, the DoE may 
organize  some  training  courses  for  the  owners 
of  the  buildings,  builders,  and  the  government 
department. 
Barriers
Small-scale 
investments 
industries  may  ﬁ nd 
in  energy  efﬁ ciency  equipment  an  expensive 
proposition.  Lack  of  awareness  is  one  of  the 
reasons for not using efﬁ cient devices.
  Demand  side  management  in  new  industries 
should be followed diligently for reducing the total 
demand for energy. 
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
The industrial sector mainly consumes electricity, 
fuelwood,  furnace  oil,  and  coal.  The  country’s 
growth  is  based  on  the  industrial  growth,  which 
is  taking  place  at  a  rapid  pace.  Because  of  this 
growth,  energy  consumption  in  the  country,  as 
discussed  in  Chapter  3,  is  enormous. To  reduce 
energy consumption in the industrial sector, speciﬁ c 
strategies for different categories of industries are 
required. As Bhutan has good potential for electricity 
generation and is dependent on the import of fuels 
like furnace oil and coal, it is necessary to reduce 
the  consumption  of  fuelwood,  coal,  and  oil  by 
the  industries. The  strategy  for  fuel  consumption 
reduction in the industries is as follows.
Energy demand reduction strategies, by 
industry
Ferro alloys
From  earlier  analysis,  it  is  observed  that  the 
ferro  alloy  industry  is  one  of  the  most  energy-
intensive  industries  in  Bhutan  and  a  signiﬁ cant 
consumer  of  electricity.  This  industry  accounts 
for  more  than  one-third  of  the  domestic  electric 
consumption. So, even a small saving can indeed 
make  a  signiﬁ cant  difference  to  total  electricity 
scenario for Bhutan. The largest ferro alloy plant 
in Bhutan is the Bhutan Ferro Alloys Ltd (BFAL). 
However,  a  number  of  such  units  are  expected 
to  come  up  by  2008.  It  is  recommended  that 
energy-efﬁ cient  technologies  be  used  extensively. 
Some 
application-based 
technological 
recommendations are as follows.
#
Strategy 17: Promote the use of energy-
efficient equipment and technologies in 
small- and medium-scale industries
Goal
The main aim of this strategy is to improve energy 
efﬁ ciency  and  reduce  energy  consumption  as 
well as pollution in the small- and medium-scale 
industries
and 
Use  of  pre-heated  (up  to  950  °C)  charge  in  a 
specially  designed  reactor  (such  as  rotary  kiln/
vertical shaft furnace) can bring down the speciﬁ c 
power  consumption  to  less  than  3000 kWh.

Cement industry
The  cement  industry  is  poised  to  play  a  big  role 
in  meeting  Bhutan’s  major  infrastructural  need 
in  the  coming  years.  As  mentioned  earlier,  the 
cement  industry  is  an  energy-intensive  industry 
in  which  electricity  and  coal  form  major  inputs 
load 
to  production.  Process  optimization, 
management,  and  operational  improvement  can 
lead  to  signiﬁ cant  energy  saving,  and  although  it 
involves marginal ﬁ nancial investment, it is found 
to have encouraging results in energy saving. These 
include the following.
#
These  reactors  can  also  be  converted  to 
reduction  reactors  for  supplying  pre-reduced 
manganese ore to electric smelting unit.
Use  of  hot  pre-reduced  ore  from  the  above 
reduction  reactors  (rotary  kiln/vertical  shaft 
furnace)  integrated  to  smelting  unit  can  bring 
about  a  drastic  reduction  in  speciﬁ c  power 
consumption (around 2000 kWh).
Although it is possible to run the electric furnace 
with an MnO content of the slag as low as 15%–
16%,  it  would  mean  high  slag  basicity,  high 
power consumption, and high fume losses.
For producing low phosphorus (less than 0.20%) 
ferro-manganese,  calcium  oxide/barium  oxide 
(CaO/BaO)-based ﬂ ux is recommended for the 
dephosphorization  of  liquid  high  carbon  Fe–
Mn. But the melt will have to be desiliconized 
to less than 0.20% Si before dephosphorization. 
Injection  of  Ca–Si  cored  wire  in  the  melt  can 
reduce  phosphorus  in  liquid  ferro-manganese 
to  less  than  0.15%.  Laboratory  investigations 
have been completed for optimizing parameters 
such as composition of the reagent, amount to 
be added, effect of variation in silicon contents, 
treatment  temperature,  and  treatment  time.  It 
is worth mentioning that for 0.10% decrease in 
phosphorus,  the  premium  obtained  is  around 
Rs 500 per tonne of ferro-manganese.
The  use  of  partially  burnt  coal  (jhama)  as  a 
partial  substitute  to  coke  needs  to  be  looked 
into and tried in actual practice, as it is expected 
to increase the charge resistance.
Annual energy auditing can be made compulsory, 
as it helps to identify the under/overutilization of 
machineries, leading to increased consumption 
of energy, particularly electricity.
Use  of  energy-efﬁ cient  technologies  in  new 
plants with soft loan/tax credit to cover part of 
additional expanses can be made mandatory.

DRI  from  DRI  reactor  to  EAF.  These  systems 
include  mechanical  conveyors,  transport  vessels

There are two primary beneﬁ ts of hot charging of 
DRI  to  an  EAF:  (1)  lower  energy  consumption 
for  melting  and  (2)  increased  productivity  due  to 
shorter  tap-to-tap  time. The  energy  savings  occur 
because  less  energy  is  required  to  bring  DRI  to 
melting  temperature.  As  a  thumb  rule,  power 
consumption  can  be  reduced  by  about  20  kWh/
tonne of liquid steel for each 100% increase in the 
composite  charge  temperature.  Also,  in  addition, 
there is saving in electrode consumption to the tune 
of 0.004 kg/kWh due to its linear relationship with 
power  consumption.  At  80%  hot  DRI  charging, 
the savings in electrode work out to be Rs 50 per 
metric  tonne  (PMT)  at  current  electrode  prices. 
Some  speciﬁ c  measures  that  can  be  adopted  are 
as follows.

Active  participation  of  employees 
in  energy

India (National Council for Cement and Building 
Materials). The  suggestion  box  schemes,  quality 
circles,  brainstorming  sessions,  and  cash  rewards 
for good suggestions are some of the schemes the 
plants can adopt for ensuring active participation 
of employees. Setting up of an energy conservation 
cell 
for  monitoring  and  controlling  energy 
performance  of  the  plant  is  gaining  importance 
in the Indian plants. Cement units can also train 
manpower, as has been done in the Indian cement 
manufacturing companies. Industry audits should 
be  made  mandatory,  and  as  mentioned  earlier, 
there  should  be  provisions  for  imposing  ﬁ nes  for 
violations against non-compliance.

Iron and steel
A  number  of  licensed  industries  are  expected 
to  come  up  in  Bhutan.  Iron  and  steel  plants 
will  constitute  a  signiﬁ cant  number,  with  some 
specializing  in  iron  re-rolling,  while  others  in  the 
iron  and  steel  making.  The  globalization  of  the 
steel  industry  has  ushered  in  a  new  era  of  cost-
competitiveness.  The  steel  industry  is  the  single 
largest energy consumer, accounting for about 4% 
of  the  world’s  energy  consumption.  The  energy 
used  is  a  major  cost  factor  for  the  steel  industry. 
In developed countries, cost of energy is between 
15% and 20% of the overall cost of production. In 
India, it is between 30% and 33%, and for Bhutan, 
it is close to 40%. In the steel industry, the greatest 
saving in energy is achieved through improvement 
in  technologies  used  for  manufacturing  iron  and 
steel. In the current route, through direct reduced 
iron  (DRI)  to  electric  arc  furnace  (EAF),  ﬁ rst 
cold  DRI/hot  briquetted  iron  (HBI)  is  produced 
at ambient temperature, and this is then fed to EAF 
to  produce  steel. This  involves  loss  of  substantial 
energy  due  to  multiple  heating  and  cooling.  So, 
there  is  a  potential  for  saving  energy  by  utilizing 
the energy technology and process of steel making. 
Various  scrap  pre-heating  technologies  are  now

‘Good Governance Plus’ recommends eco-friendly 
mass transport system in the major urban areas. 
  Petrol and diesel are the two fuels that are used 
in  the  transport  sector  in  Bhutan.  The  country 
imports both these fuels, and over a period of time, 
there is an increasing trend in their consumption 
levels. Diesel imports were 51 460 kilolitres in 2005, 
of  which  a  substantial  proportion  (about  49  197 
kilolitres) was used in the transport sector alone. 
The  imports  for  petrol  stood  at  13  795  kilolitres 
in 2005, which was mainly used for transportation. 
At  present,  alternative  fuels  such  as  natural  gas, 
electricity, and LPG are not used in Bhutan.
  Bhutan has no vehicle manufacturing facilities, 
and all vehicles are imported. Majority of vehicles 
are  imported  from  India,  Japan,  and  Korea. 
Import of vehicle is increasing as the economy is 
progressing.  The  number  of  different  categories 
of  motor  vehicles  imported  in  Bhutan  in  2005  is 
given in Table 1. 
Industries like wood and steel milling industries 
can be speciﬁ cally targeted by conducting energy 
audit. Replacement of motors and use of energy-
efﬁ cient  lighting  are  two  major  energy  measures 
for these small units.
 
TRANSPORT SECTOR 
The transport sector in Bhutan comprises road and 
air transport. Bhutan’s transport sector contributed 
16% to the overall gross domestic product (GDP) 
at  the  end  of  the  Eighth  Five-year  Plan  (1997–
2001). The development strategy for the transport 
sector  in  Bhutan  aims  at  achieving  a  number  of 
milestones, as articulated in a comprehensive vision 
statement of Bhutan’s future (Bhutan 2020: A Vision 
of Peace, Prosperity and Happiness). These milestones 
include  (1)  75%  of  rural  population  living  within 
half-day’s  walk  from  nearest  road,  (2)  national 
trunk roads upgraded to take 30-tonne lorries, and 
(3) completing second transnational highway.
  The vision of Bhutan’s National Transport Policy 
is to ensure ‘access to quality transport services by 
all, taking into consideration the requirements of 
a landlocked country’.

In  future,  petrol  and  diesel  will  remain  the 
encourage the use of fuels of certain speciﬁ cations, 
which also contain low percentages of pollutants. 
 In case of Bhutan, the import of latest vehicles, 
for  example  4WD  Hi  Lux  or  Scorpio,  which 
need  special  high-octane  petrol  has  also  been 
accompanied  by  import  of  this  fuel  in  the  past 
few years. This is evident from the import ﬁ gures 
of the past few years.

being developed, which is essentially looking into 
the  aspects  of  (1)  emission  reduction  strategies, 
(2)  trafﬁ c  density  and  trafﬁ c  ﬂ ow  analysis,  and 
(3) suggestions on mass transport and alternative 
transport means like rope ways and river navigation 
for  mountainous  areas.  The  Transport  Sector 
Master  Plan  study  team  has  already  identiﬁ ed 
some strategies for the above aspects. However, it 
is advisable to study them from energy efﬁ ciency 
point of view so that energy-efﬁ cient technologies 
are selected. 
  For  a  place  like  Bhutan,  which  has  very  few 
industries  and  no  thermal  power  plants,  the 
transport  sector  contributes  substantially  to  air 
pollution.  As  all  major  settlements  are  situated 
in  valleys,  local  air  pollution  levels  are  bound  to 
increase  due  to  the  extensive  use  of  fossil  fuels 
in  the  transport  sector.  The  Transport  Sector 
Master  Plan  is  looking  into  the  pollution  levels 
and emission standards issues; hence, these are not 
considered exclusively in this study. 
 
dominant fuels. 
 
Current and anticipated issues in the transport 
sector of Bhutan
The  options  to  improve  energy  efﬁ ciency  and 
reduce  consumption  of  petroleum  fuels  in  the 
transport  sector  can  be  classiﬁ ed  into  following 
major categories.
#
Introducing  efﬁ cient  mass  transport  and/or 
improving mass transport efﬁ ciencies.
Improving energy efﬁ ciency of petrol and diesel 
vehicles by making the latest European vehicle 
efﬁ ciency norm compliance mandatory for the 
imported vehicles.
Introducing alternative fuel vehicles.
Designing  transport  system,  including  trafﬁ c 
ﬂ ow analysis, for reducing trafﬁ c congestion.
Introducing alternative transport methods such 
as river navigation and rope ways.

Situational analysis
Bhutan  imports  vehicles  from  nearby  countries. 
Majority of vehicles come from India, followed by 
Korea  and  Japan.  Due  to  regulations  in  customs 
and major imports being through the state-owned 
State Trading  Corporation  of  Bhutan  and  balance 
through the agents of major vehicle manufacturers 
like  Maruti  Motors  in  India  and  Hundai  from 
Korea, Bhutan has so far not experienced dumping 
of  old  vehicles  from  nearby  countries  due  to  the 
prohibition  imposed  by  the  Royal  Government  of 
Bhutan (RGoB). This has prevented the use of old 
and  inefﬁ cient  vehicles  in  the  country.  However, 
in the future, import of even more efﬁ cient motor 
vehicles should be encouraged.
  Engine exhaust emissions are also closely linked 
to the fuel efﬁ ciency of the vehicles. Thus, use of 
efﬁ cient  vehicles  is  of  paramount  importance  to 
keep the local air pollution levels low. Various fuel 
efﬁ ciency norms are developed and adopted in India 
and other European countries. As a policy measure 
to  promote  the  use  of  fuel-efﬁ cient  vehicles,  the 
government  could  put  in  place  mandatory  strict 
vehicle emission control norms. These norms also 
Introduction of vehicles running on 
alternative fuel
Vehicles running on alternative fuels are becoming 
reality  in  many  countries.  Alternative  fuels  offer 
choice  of  fuels  that  contain  less  or  practically 
zero  pollutant.  Examples  of  such  fuels  are  CNG 
(compressed  natural  gas)  and  biofuels,  which 
can  be  produced  in  an  environment-friendly 
way  by  using  carbon-neutral  bioenergy. Vehicles 
running on electricity are also becoming popular. 
Futuristic  options  include  hybrid  vehicles  that 
run  on  hydrogen  and  electricity.  A  range  of  fuel 
options are being evaluated for the transport sector 
worldwide (TERI 2005) and are discussed in the 
subsequent sections.

Compressed natural gas
Use  of  CNG  as  a  clean  and  cheaper  fuel  for 
transport  has  proved  to  be  successful  in  many 
cases,  including  public  transport  system  of  the 
Indian  capital  city  of  New  Delhi.  It  is  a  safe, 
clean  burning,  and  environment-friendly  fuel.  It 
has  been  established  that  exhaust  emissions  like 
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are signiﬁ cantly 
reduced when CNG is used as compared to other 
fuels.  Toxic  emissions  of  lead  and  sulphur  are 
completely eliminated. Existing petrol vehicles can 
use  CNG  by  ﬁ tting  a  conversion  kit. The  CNG-
converted vehicles have the ﬂ exibility of operating 
either  on  petrol  or  on  CNG.  Recently,  major 
vehicle  manufacturers  in  India  have  introduced 
CNG  vehicles  in  the  Indian  market.  However, 
in  Bhutan,  lack  of  infrastructure  and  limited 
availability of CNG are major barriers in the use 
of  CNG  in  the  transport  sector.  However,  under 
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation 
(SAARC)  initiative,  Bhutan  can  look  into  the 
possibility  of  getting  CNG  for  the  transport 
sector and industries, at least in the border areas 
of Bhutan. Techno-ﬁ nancial feasibility studies are 
required  for  this  purpose,  which  can  be  taken 
up  in  the Tenth  Plan  period.  Investments  in  the 
development of infrastructure for CNG transport 
and handling would be a critical issue, considering 
the number of vehicles in the countries and their 
distribution.   
provided at subsidized rate. Thus, because the use 
of  LPG  as  a  cleaner  fuel  to  reduce  air  pollution 
is  an  option,  its  import  under  subsidy  quota 
for  transport  applications  could  be  discussed 
in  bilateral  meetings  with  India. This  may  have 
impact on trade balance. A study to compare the 
pros and cons of using LPG for other applications 
in general and for the transport sector in particular 
is  required,  as  other  issues  like  infrastructure  for 
distribution, and market segments and their share 
in  LPG  demand  are  also  important  and  need  to 
be studied in detail. A joint study between Bhutan 
and India can be taken up in the Tenth Plan. 
Biofuels 
Biofuels  are  the  fuels  derived  from  biomass,  that 
is, recently living organisms or their metabolic by-
products.  Ethanol,  methanol,  and  bio-diesel  are 
important biofuels that can be used for vehicular 
applications. 
Ethanol and methanol
Mixing  of  ethanol  and  methanol  in  petrol  and 
diesel, up to 10%, is possible for use in conventional 
petrol and diesel engines without any modiﬁ cation. 
Ethanol  and  methanol  are  generally  produced  as 
by-products in sugar and other industries. Bhutan 
currently  has  no  industries  producing  ethanol  or 
methanol. 
Bio-diesel
Bio-diesel  is  produced  by  processing  vegetable 
oil. This process, called as esteriﬁ cation, converts 
vegetable oil to a diesel-like fuel having properties 
similar  to  diesel.  The  interest  in  bio-diesel  is 
increasing worldwide since 2000. The US and the 
European  countries  are  using  soybean,  rapeseed, 
and  other  edible  oils  for  producing  bio-diesel.  In 
India, bio-diesel production using locally available 
species of non-edible oil-bearing plant seeds such 
as jatropha and pongamia is preferred. In Bhutan, 
locally available oil-bearing plants can be studied, 
and indigenous development of bio-diesel can be 
taken up as a joint research project with the Indian 
institutes  under  the  aegis  of  the  Department  of 
Science and Technology (DST). This would be a 
medium-term (ﬁ ve to seven years) strategy, which 
can be initiated in the Tenth Plan. 
Liquefied petroleum gas
LPG is deemed to be superior to petrol and diesel 
in terms of vehicular emissions. To abate pollution 
caused  by  vehicles,  a  number  of  countries  have 
been using LPG as auto fuel. 
  Typically,  the  exhaust  emissions  of  vehicles 
running on LPG comprise
#
75% less carbon monoxide,
85% less hydrocarbons,
40% less nitrous oxide, and
result in 87% less ozone depletion. 
#
as compared to vehicles running on petrol.

Electric vehicles
With  vast  potential  available  for  hydropower 
generation, use of electricity for mass transport and 
use of electric/hybrid vehicles for personal transport 
are viable options for Bhutan in medium term. 
  Hybrid (petrol–electric) and electric vehicles are 
now  being  developed  by  many  major  automobile 
manufacturers  worldwide.  Currently,  vehicles 
are  imported  from  India,  Japan,  Korea,  and 
China. Automobile companies in these countries, 
in  India  and  Japan,  have  already 
especially 
ﬂ ooded  the  market  with  electric  vehicles.  Major 
automobile manufacturers like M/s Mahindra and 
Mahindra  and  M/s  Bajaj  Auto  Ltd  from  India 
are  already  testing  electric  three-wheelers  (six-
seater vehicles) in Indian markets. These vehicles 
can  be  introduced  in  Bhutan  on  demonstration 
basis  for  public  transport  in  cities  like Thimphu 
and  Phuentsholing.  A  note  on  the  experience  of 
implementing electric vehicles as public transport 
is given in Box 2. Market for electric cars like REVA 
can also be explored, especially in ﬂ at terrain areas 
in southern Bhutan.
  Electric minibuses are being introduced by many 
Indian  automobile  manufacturers  like  Mahindra 
and Mahindra and others. 
  Minibuses  and  three-wheelers  running  on 
electricity  can  be  promoted  in  small  urban 
areas  and  in  major  town  areas  like  Thimphu. 
The  DoE  and  the  Ministry  of  Information  and 
Communications  (MoIC)  can  undertake  a  joint 
project,  which  can  also  be  submitted  as  a  Clean 
Development Mechanism (CDM) project.
fuel  economy  of  new  small  cars  sold  in  India  is 
about 13.6 km per litre, while that of a small four-
stroke  motorcycle  is  54  km  per  litre,  and  that  of 
buses  is  around  3  km  per  litre. These  ﬁ gures  do 
not reﬂ ect the state-of-the-art technology but point 
to  the  fact  that  due  to  lower  power  requirement 
and small size, coupled with advanced technology, 
considerable improvements are possible in vehicles. 
The fuel economy based on typical vehicles likely 
to  be  operated  in  India  through  2020  is  given  in 
Table 2. These could be considered for Bhutan as 
well,  as  most  of  the  vehicles  are  imported  from 
India.

Diesel vehicles have better fuel economy than the

and  diesel  fuel  contains  more  energy  per  litre. 
However,  emissions  from  diesel  vehicles  are  a 
serious problem.

NEPAL’S EXPERIENCE WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLE 
To tackle the problem of air pollution in Kathmandu valley, Nepal started using electric vehicles in 1997. These 
were known as Safa tempos. About 600 of these tempos were introduced. Subsequently, a major project was 
initiated by ‘Kathmandu Electric Vehicle Alliance (KEVA)’ to improve the operational effi  ciency of these tempos. 
  KEVA is a joint programme undertaken by an NGO (non-governmental organization), government, and private 
sector to improve the air quality of the Kathmandu valley. Details of the project are available at <http://www.

and,  most  importantly,  proper  storage,  handling, 
and  processing  of  harvested  produce  to  reduce 
wastage  are  few  things  that  can  be  considered 
jointly  by  the  DoE  and  Ministry  of  Agriculture 
(MoA). 
  Various  studies  conducted  and  data  generated 
show  that  the  diesel-powered  multi-utility  power 
tillers are the most useful and, hence, sought-after 
farm  equipment  in  Bhutan. These  are  currently 
subsidized  under  Japanese  funds.  The  RGoB 
can  consider  providing  further  support  for  this 
programme  to  improve  the  availability  of  such 
power tillers. Some applications for the agriculture 
sector,  which  can  help  reduce  the  overall  energy 
demand  or  import  of  energy,  are  discussed 
subsequently.
emission  of  high  level  of  respirable  particulate 
matter.  Hence,  low  sulphur  diesel,  that  is,  diesel 
containing 0.5% sulphur by weight as against the 
normal proportion of 1% by weight, or ultra low 
sulphur  diesel,  that  is,  diesel  containing  0.25% 
sulphur, is used in many countries. The Ministry 
of  Economic  Affairs  can  consider  making  ultra 
low  sulphur  diesel  mandatory  in  phased  manner 
in Bhutan.
AGRICULTURE SECTOR
Energy  needs  of  the  agriculture  sector  vary  at 
different stages, as shown in Figure 4. 
  Currently,  energy  consumption  in  farming  is 
very  low,  mainly  due  to  the  mountainous  nature 
of the terrain, small farm size, and low investment 
in farming.
  However, modern energy based interventions to 
improve  farm  productivity  and  labour  efﬁ ciency, 
thereby reducing the requirement of human labour

Biogas-based water pumping, space heating, 
and food processing
The  agriculture  sector  generates  biomass  residue 
as a farm product waste, along with other wastes 
like animal dung. Biogas plants may be developed 
at  these  farm  sites,  and  the  gas  produced  can 
be  used  for  pumping  water,  space  heating,  and 
food  processing  applications. The  DoE  can  take 
initiatives  in  the  implementation  of  these  plants 
by  creating  awareness  and  providing  subsidy 
schemes.
demonstration  programme.  Also,  solar-powered 
fencing may be implemented in the farms.
Mechanization/cold storage facilities/ice 
production facilities
Refrigerated/ice cooled trailers for power 
tiller/ refrigerated vehicles
Loss  of  agriculture  produce  in  transit  between 
farms and marketplace is common in Bhutan due 
to difﬁ cult terrain and lack of farm roads in most 
parts of the country. This loss can be reduced by 
developing small movable refrigeration/ice storage 
systems,  which  can  store  farm  produce  in  cold 
storage till they are delivered. Special research and 
development  project  can  be  taken  up  jointly  by 
research organizations in India, such as TERI, in 
collaboration with the DoE and MoA. This would 
prove to be a very useful strategy in long term. 
Diesel-powered power tillers
Diesel-powered power tillers are currently provided 
by the MoA through Japanese government’s aided 
scheme on subsidy. These power tillers are multi-
purpose and are quite popular among farmers as 
is evident from the fact that there is a waiting list 
for procuring these tillers. These tillers are driven 
by  diesel  and  their  faster  penetration  would  lead 
to improved farm productivity. 
Promotion of gasifier for cardamom drying 
Cardamom is one of the most important agriculture 
products  in  Bhutan,  which  requires  drying.  To 
use the locally available biomass resources for the 
drying purpose, biomass gasiﬁ ers can be used for 
drying.  Initially,  the  DoE  may  install  a  gasiﬁ er 
under a demonstration project and then promote 
the  installation  of  these  gasiﬁ ers  by  undertaking 
awareness  campaign  and  providing  subsidy  to 
farmers.
Small wind-operated pump sets
Bhutan’s agriculture sector represented by dry land 
farming, which depends on rainwater. Because the 
terrain is mountainous, It is difﬁ cult to dig canals 
and pump water. In windy areas, small mechanical 
wind  pumps  or  small  wind  electric  generator 
powered pump sets can be installed. These would 
be site-speciﬁ c applications. The DoE can initiate 
a demonstration programme on these lines. 
Overall implementation strategy for the 
demand side management
The precise time schedule for the implementation 
of the strategies suggested above are given in Table 
3, and the results of the impact assessment of the 
proposed strategies are given in Table 4.
Energy-efficient pump sets
Although water pump sets are not used extensively 
in the agriculture sector in Bhutan when compared 
with  other  countries,  energy-efﬁ cient  pump  sets 
can be promoted through labelling scheme, which 
is proposed for all electrical appliances. 
ESTIMATED BUDGET FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION 
OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES RECOMMENDED FOR 
DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT OF ENERGY
A budget has been estimated for different strategies, 
by sector, as suggested for the implementation of 
the plan related to the demand side management 
of energy and is given in Table 5. This budget head 
does  not  include  the  capital  cost  and  manpower 
cost involved from the implementing agencies.
Solar-powered pesticide sprayers and solar 
fencing
Solar-powered  pesticide  sprayers  are  handy 
equipment,  which  run  on  solar-powered  packs. 
These would be useful for farmers as they are light 
weight and easy to operate. 
It  is  recommended  that  the  MoA  and  DoE 
introduce  them  under  jointly  funded  subsidy/

Overarching issues: energy, 
development, and environment 
There  are  many  issues  that  are  closely 
to meet the needs of a growing industry. Bhutan’s 
energy system is also particularly vulnerable to the 
impacts of climate change, given that water ﬂ ows 
are  likely  to  be  affected  due  to  global  warming 
in future (ICIMOD 2005). Apart from this, other 
climate change adaptation issues may emerge over 
the  period.  The  issue  of  adaptation  to  climate 
change is discussed later in this chapter. 
  For a developing country like Bhutan that has 
a mountainous terrain, energy security also needs 
to  be  looked  at  from  a  micro  perspective—are 
the  remotest  regions  and  the  poorest  assured  of 
secure and affordable energy? The basic nature of 
energy  would  imply  that  the  energy  for  essential 
household needs should be given preference when 
energy  is  available  in  limited  quantity.  Although 
policy  directives  are  clear  on  this  front,  this  also 
necessitates that decentralized or non-conventional 
source  of  energy  be  tapped  not  just  to  minimize 
import  dependence  but  also  to  provide  energy 
where  conventional  supply  networks  cannot 
reach. 
  Following  points  reﬂ ect  some  of  the  country-
speciﬁ c energy security concerns in Bhutan.
#
related with the way the development 
of  the  energy  sector  is  taking  place 
in Bhutan. While some of these cross 
linkages  are  quite  obvious,  a  few  are  not  that 
apparent. The  following  sections  attempt  to  put 
these critical issues in the right perspective. 
ENERGY SECURITY
The  concept  of  energy  security  has  witnessed  a 
paradigm  change.  Historically,  energy  security 
focused  primarily  on  concerns  on  oil  disruption 
in  the  oil-producing  world. This  concern  has  not 
been addressed till now. In fact, many other related 
concerns have emerged now. Concerns over energy 
security  are  not  limited  to  oil  alone;  reliability 
of  electricity  supply  systems  has  become  an 
important issue, given the chronic power shortages 
in developing countries and incidents of blackouts 
in the developed world. Sophisticated integration 
of energy systems also means that a break at any 
point in the supply chain can reverberate through 
the entire system. Moreover, it must be recognized 
that  energy  security  is  not  a  stand-alone  entity. 
It  assumes  a  larger  dimension  among  countries. 
At  the  same  time,  a  new  range  of  vulnerabilities 
has  become  more  evident—energy  systems  are 
at  unprecedented  risk  from  political  turmoil, 
terrorism, and the impacts of climate change. 
  Bhutan  is  already  confronting  some  of  these 
issues. The country has no known reserves of fossil 
fuels and has no option but to import oil to satisfy 
its growing needs. 
  While hydropower is available in plenty to meet 
the country’s needs, there are concerns about the 
shortage of electricity in the lean season, especially 
Plugging electricity demand–supply gap during 
lean period.
High  dependence  on  hydropower,  with 
hydropower  accounting  for  more  than  99%  of 
the electricity generated. Furthermore, country’s 
two  major  power  plants,  namely,  Chukha  and 
Tala hydropower plants, are responsible for the 
majority of electricity generation.
Vulnerability  of  power  generation  to  water 
supply due to the impact of climate change.
Dependence of the country on oil import from 
India.

OVERARCHING ISSUES: ENERGY, DEVELOPMENT, AND ENVIRONMENT 
Little  choice  of  other  energy  resources,  as 
the  electricity  sector  is  highly  subsidized  and 
hydropower is cheap.
regional disparities – in terms of per capita income 
and availability of basic services – both across the 
different  geographical  regions  of  the  country  as 
well  as  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  Almost 
70%  of  the  Bhutan’s  population,  comprising 
634 982 people (Census of Bhutan 2005), resides 
in rural areas. Not surprisingly, poverty in Bhutan 
is  largely  a  rural  phenomenon  as  the  data  of  the 
Bhutan  Living  Standards  Survey  2003  noted  that 
about 40% of the rural population was poor, while 
less  than  5%  of  the  urban  population  was  poor.1 
Likewise,  the  poverty  gap  and  poverty  severity 
indices showed that poverty was deeply entrenched 
and  more  severe  in  rural  areas  as  compared  to 
urban areas.2
  The  regional  disparity  is  also  evident  in  the 
spread  of  the  electricity  network  in  the  country, 
as  discussed  in  Chapter  4. These  disparities  are 
reﬂ ected  in  the  tendency  of  most  immigrants  to 
move  towards  the  western  part  of  the  country. 
Migration to towns in the western region is almost 
double of that in the eastern region.
  This  divide  would  need  to  be  tackled  using  a 
two-pronged  approach—on  the  one  hand,  there 
is  a  need  to  plan  more  townships,  particularly  in 
the  eastern  part  of  the  country,  on  the  other,  the 
‘push factor’ from rural areas needs to be arrested 
through  concerted  efforts  at  rural  development. 
The  importance  of  rural  development  in  poverty 
reduction is evident from the fact that it has been 
identiﬁ ed, together with the promotion of balanced 
regional development, private sector development, 
and 
infrastructure  development  as  the  main 
objectives  in  the Tenth  Five-year  Plan  guidelines. 
The  next  section  describes  the  challenges  facing 
in  Bhutan  and 
rural  economic  development 
expounds how energy services can address them. 
#
While  maintaining  the  security  of  supply  at 
the  macro  and  micro  levels  by  investing  in 
infrastructure  and  diversiﬁ cation  of  the  energy 
portfolio,  another  important  aspect  of  energy 
security 
is  reducing  energy  consumption  by 
improving energy efﬁ ciency. This has increasingly 
become  a  feasible  alternative  today  due  to  the 
advancement of technology and the possibility of 
international  technology  transfers.  In  most  cases, 
the  best  near-term  option  for  increasing  energy 
security is through energy efﬁ ciency. These options 
are covered extensively in the earlier chapters. 
ENERGY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION AND 
BALANCED REGIONAL GROWTH
It is now well established that income (or the lack 
of it) is only one aspect of poverty. In a wider sense, 
poverty is deprivation, which may be traced to ﬁ ve 
inter-related  clusters  of  disadvantages:  physical 
weakness  (lack  of  strength,  under-nutrition,  ill 
health,  disability,  high  ratio  of  dependents  to 
active  adults);  isolation  (physical  remoteness, 
ignorance,  and  lack  of  access  to  information  or 
knowledge);  income  poverty  (lack  of  income 
and  wealth);  vulnerability  (increased  exposure 
to  contingencies,  and  danger  of  becoming  more 
deprived);  and  powerlessness  (inability  to  cope, 
adapt, and choose) (Chambers 1989).
  Energy can play a fundamental role in minimizing 
each of these disadvantages, as shown in Figure 1. 
  While  issues  related  to  electricity  export  and 
optimizing the use of electricity for the promotion 
of domestic industry have been dealt with before, 
this  section  discusses  the  importance  of  energy 
systems and options to be planned so as to promote 
regionally balanced development. 
  A  quick  look  at  the  economic  and  social 
indicators  for  Bhutan  shows  the  presence  of 
Challenges in rural development
About 66% of the Bhutanese workforce is engaged 
in agriculture and forestry (Statistical Yearbook of 
Bhutan 2005).3 Farming in Bhutan is a challenge 
1  The poor include households with real consumption less than the poverty line.
2  The Poverty Gap Index measures the intensity of poverty for the population—it reﬂ ects the difference between the poverty line and 
actual expenditure. The Poverty Severity Index is calculated as the weighted sum of poverty gaps (as a proportion of the poverty line), 
with weight proportionate to poverty gaps. 
3  The main cereals growing in Bhutan are rice, maize, wheat, barley, buckwheat, and millet. Cash crops include oranges, potatoes, apples, 
plums, walnuts, and vegetables. Cereal cultivation is, however, dominated by maize and rice.

FIGURE 1  ENERGY SERVICES CONTRIBUTE TO BREAKING THE DEPRIVATION TRAP
  Livestock  rearing  is  an  integral  part  of  the 
farming  system  in  the  country.  Close  to  95%  of 
the  rural  households  own  an  average  of  ﬁ ve  to 
nine  cattle,  which  primarily  serve  as  a  source  of 
draught  power  and  manure  for  their  ﬁ elds  and 
dairy  products  for  household  uses.  However, 
the  potential  of  livestock  in  contributing  to  farm 
income is constrained by the lack of adequate feed 
and fodder and poor health services. 
because  of  low  soil  fertility,  poor  infrastructure, 
small  landholding  size,  occurrence  of  natural 
disasters like ﬂ oods, and the mountainous terrain, 
all  of  which  make  the  activity  labour-intensive. 
The majority of the farming households own less 
than 3 acres of land (RNR Statistics 2000), which 
can  only  provide  subsistence  living,  as  is  evident 
from  the  fact  that  less  than  5%  of  the  domestic 
rice  production  in  the  country  in  2002  (38  000 
tonnes)  was  marketed.  Some  54  000  tonnes  of 
rice  was  imported  to  meet  domestic  demand. 
Studies suggest that in many villages, up to 50% 
of  the  households  are  often  food  insecure,  while 
seasonally,  this  ﬁ gure  may  go  up  to  75%.  Box  1 
presents  constraints  encountered  in  food  grain 
production. 
Inadequate  return  from  agriculture  is  fuelling 
migration from rural to urban areas. The resulting 
decline in the availability of labour further affects 
the productivity of the sector, which has historically 
been  labour-intensive. The  inﬂ ux  of  migrants  is 
restricted to a few urban centres. Some estimates 
suggest that at 10% rate of growth of population,

CONSTRAINTS IN FOOD GRAIN PRODUCTION
According  to  a  survey  carried  out  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Royal  Government  of  Bhutan,  the  main 
constraints faced by the farming households in food grain production include destruction by wild animals (54% 
of the respondents saw this as a major concern), lack of irrigation (28%), labour shortage (20%), and small size 
of landholding (13%). Destruction by pests and diseases (13%) and limited access to markets (10%) also aff ect 
food grain production

Thimphu is growing at a rate, which is more than 
three times the national rate, with Phuentsholing 
only  slightly  behind. At  this  rate,  close  to  half  of 
Bhutan’s population will be living in urban areas 
within the next 20–25 years (Vision 2020). The rate 
of urbanization is a concern for several reasons. 
#
services,  including  land  legislation  and  land 
markets, are not well developed. 
Employment  opportunities  in  urban  areas  will 
not be enough for a growing urban population, 
which  could  result  in  social  and  political 
instability in the country (see Box 2). 
#
Given the topography of the country, the land 
required  to  accommodate  the  growing  urban 
population  is  limited. The  general  absence  of 
ﬂ at  land  for  population  could  result  in  the 
settlement at steeper valley slopes, which should 
be  best  left  for  vegetation  cover.  Apart  from 
enhancing deforestation, this could also add to 
the risks of erosion, disruption of watercourses, 
and  the  possibility  of  ﬂ ooding  and  landslides 
during monsoons.
Towns are poorly equipped to deal with a rapid 
inﬂ ux of migrants, as urban infrastructure and 
There  is  a  need  to  restrict  migration  by  creating 
viable  opportunities  in  rural  areas,  which  would 
allow  the  poor  to  participate  in  the  market 
economy  and  improve  their  livelihoods.  Given 
the  intrinsic  constraints  faced  by  the  agriculture 
sector  in  Bhutan,  the  key  to  rural  development 
will be agricultural diversiﬁ cation and promotion 
of small-scale and cottage industries in rural areas, 
with an emphasis on high-value niche markets. This 
will  also  catalyse  more  dispersed  and  regionally 
balanced  growth  and  employment  compared  to

RURAL–URBAN MIGRATION: DRIVERS AND FALLOUT
The fi rst labour force survey held in 1998 found that 76% of the labour force was employed in the agriculture 
sector.After that, employment in the Renewable and Natural Resources (RNR) sector decreased to about 66% in 
2004. Over 81% of the unemployed in Bhutan live in rural areas.  A study on rural–urban migration, carried out 
by the Ministry of Agriculture, found that 47% of all households comprised migrants. While lack of educational 
facilities was the reason behind migration of 46% of the people, 19% left their villages due to small landholdings, 
drudgery of farm work, unproductive agriculture, crop damages by wild animals, and natural calamities.
  The demographic transition in the country will mean that the growth in the demand for jobs will far exceed 
the rate of population growth. Vision 2020 for Bhutan notes that by 2020, a total of 267 000 jobs will need to be 
created even under the most favourable demographic scenario. The number of job seekers will be considerably 
higher if one factors in those who chose to leave the RNR sector and migrate to urban areas and those who 
are displaced as a result of mechanization or improvements in labour productivity in the agriculture and other 
sectors.
  On the other hand, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Bhutan in the last decade or so has been 
driven by hydropower, construction, service, and power-intensive manufacturing sectors, which have relatively 
low employment elasticity. The Bhutanese have a preference for public sector jobs; however, given the emphasis 
on the formation of a compact, professional, and effi  cient organization, future opportunities in the government 
will also be limited.

large  industry.  Currently,  over  55%  of  industries 
in  Bhutan  are  located  in Thimphu,  Chukha,  and 
Paro Dzongkhags (Statistical Yearbook 2005). The 
importance of industry and services in rural areas 
is evident from the fact that in rural areas, a greater 
proportion of the non-poor work in these sectors 
compared to the poor (Table 1). 
Enhancing  food  grain  production  through 
improved  crop  varieties  and  complementary 
inputs. 
Exploiting the regional and seasonal comparative 
advantages  that  Bhutan  has  in  the  cultivation 
of  both  temperate  and  sub-temperate  fruits 
and  vegetables.  In  2004,  exports  of  oranges 
constituted about 3.4% of the total value of top 
10  exports  from  Bhutan  (Statistical Yearbook 
of  Bhutan  2005).  The  government  aims  at 
increasing the value of horticultural exports by 
200%  by  2007  and  by  300%  by  2012  (Vision 
2020). 
Diversifying 
the  rural  economic  base  by 
encouraging  other  high-value,  low-value,  and 
off-season  produce,  such  as  medicinal  and 
aromatic plants, and ﬂ oriculture. 
Developing small and cottage industries in rural 
areas with an emphasis on creating productive 
employment  rather  than  capturing  export 
markets. 
Promoting  animal  health  services,  feed  and 
fodder production, and animal breeding services, 
given that livestock represent an important asset, 
especially  for  the  marginal  farmers.  Further, 
development  of  backyard  livestock  farms  can 
also  bring  down  imports  of  animal  products 
like cheese and meat.

  Though small- and cottage-scale ﬁ rms comprise 
about 40% of the industrial units in Bhutan (Figure 
2),  the  sector  is  dominated  by  micro-enterprises 
(largely comprising small family-run business such 
as restaurants, tea stalls, and rice mills) that have 
limited scope for expansion.
  The  Royal  Government  of  Bhutan  (RGoB)  is 
following  a ‘triple  gem  approach’  for  agricultural 
development  and  diversiﬁ cation  by  increasing 
in 
productivity,  accessibility,  and  marketing

incomes  and  employment  opportunities  in  rural 
areas,  generate  export  revenue,  and  achieve  an 
improvement in the nutritional status of the rural 
population while conserving and managing natural

The realization of these objectives calls for urgent 
and  signiﬁ cant  expansion  of  rural  infrastructure, 
including  farm  mechanization,  irrigation,  roads, 
cold  storage  facilities,  and  access  of  small-scale 
producers to technology, credit, and markets. Left 
to  market  mechanisms,  the  focus  on  the  growth 
of  urban  and  large  industry  will  continue  for 
reasons related to economies of scale, proﬁ tability, 
and  access  to  infrastructure,  markets,  credit,  and 
technology.
  Energy will be a key input in the government’s 
efforts  towards  rural  development  and  reducing 
the  rates  of  rural–urban  migration.  The  Vision

Preservation 
the 
and 
environment  are  the  main  principles  of  the 
development  philosophy  in  Bhutan.  This  is  not 
only important in itself but also closely linked to 
both  economic  growth  of  the  country  (given  the 
economic importance of hydropower and tourism) 
and  poverty  reduction  (given  the  dependence 
of  communities  on  forests  for  food,  medicines, 
energy,  fodder,  organic  fertilizers,  and  so  on). 
Environmental sustainability would, therefore, be 
a key criterion in the policy-making across sectors. 
From  the  point  of  view  of  the  energy  sector, 
important  environmental  issues  include  possible 
diversion  of  forest  land  towards  constructing 
energy  infrastructure,  ecological  impacts  of  large 
hydro  projects,  more  so  in  the  case  of  storage 
projects that are likely to come up in future, and 
the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  the 
energy  sector  of  Bhutan.  Subsequent  sections 
discuss these aspects in detail.

and,  hence,  creating  productive  employment  in 
rural areas. 
sustainable  use  of 
Energy for rural development
Energy is a key ingredient for rural development, 
for  agricultural  growth  and 
whether 
diversiﬁ cation, for the promotion of rural industry 
or for augmenting the provision of basic education 
and health care services.
  Energy  constitutes  a  key  direct  and  indirect 
input into agriculture. Direct energy needs include 
energy  required  for  land  preparation,  cultivation, 
irrigation,  harvesting,  post-harvest  processing, 
food  production,  storage,  and  the  transport  of 
agricultural  inputs  and  outputs.  Indirect  energy 
needs  are  in  the  form  of  sequestered  energy  in 
fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides. 
Modern energy consumption can also be expected 
to  increase  agricultural  productivity  and  food 
security.4
  Agriculture  in  Bhutan  continues  to  be  based, 
to  a  large  extent,  on  animal  and  human  energy. 
Commercial  energy  use  in  agriculture  is  limited 
(Bhutan Energy Data Directory 2005). While the 
input  supply  system  in  Bhutan  is  subsidized  and 
access  is  universal,  its  beneﬁ ts  are  constrained 
by  the  lack  of  proper  storage  facilities,  transport, 
and  access  roads,  the  development  of  all  of 
which  is  dependent  on  energy  infrastructure  in 
rural  areas.  For  example,  horticulture  products 
require  a  temperature-controlled  atmosphere  for 
transportation  between  the  farm  and  the  end 
market, and storage. Again, irrigation systems in the 
country, largely dependent on the monsoons, are 
usually small, being typically less than 100 hectares 
in  extent,  and  are  gravity-fed  from  streams. The 
development  of  engineered  irrigation,  especially 
for horticulture, will also need energy inputs as is 
true for livestock health services. Small-scale rural 
industry can also beneﬁ t from augmented energy 
infrastructure in rural areas.

Impacts of energy infrastructure on forest area 
and ecology
Conservation  of  forests  and  biodiversity  is  a 
central tenet in Bhutan’s development endeavour.

conservation against exploitation began as early as 
1969 when the Bhutan Forest Act was enacted. The 
Act brought all forest resources under state control 
with the intent to curb exploitation and rationalize 
usage. Subsequently, a number of legislations have 
been enacted to protect the forests of the country.

The Department of Forests (now known as the Department of Forestry Services) was the very fi rst government 
department to be instituted in 1952. The objective was to harvest timber, the most visible natural resource at the 
time. The principle of conservation against exploitation was introduced as early as 1969 when the Bhutan Forest 
Act was enacted. The Act brought all forest resources under state control, with the intent to curb exploitation 
and rationalize usage. As the forerunner of all modern legislation, it also refl ected the importance attached by 
the government to the conservation of forests. This was further consolidated in 1974 with the formulation of the 
National Forest Policy, the nationalization of logging operations in 1979, and the establishment of a network of 
protected areas in 1983. 
  A ban on the exports of wood logs was imposed in 1973, which aff ected the cutting of forests in Bhutan for 
commercial exploitation.
  The Bhutan Trust Fund (BTF) for Environmental Conservation was created in 1991 under the Royal Charter 
as  an  independent  mechanism  to  sustain  fi nancing  for  environmental  conservation,  primarily  in  protected 
areas. The  national  protected  areas  system  was  revised  again  in  1993  to  make  it  more  representative  of  the 
various major ecosystems in the country. In 1995, the Forest and Nature Conservation Act, or FNCA, was ratifi ed, 
repealing  the  Bhutan  Forest  Act,  1969.  The  aim  of  the  FNCA  was  to  address  evolving  conservation  needs, 
including community participation and protected area management. In the same year, Bhutan ratifi ed two major 
international conventions related to environmental conservation—the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 
and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In keeping with the requirements 
of the CBD, the country produced its fi rst Biodiversity Action Plan in 1998 and, subsequently, updated it in 2002 
to refl ect progress and new conservation needs. A network of biological corridors linked the national protected 
areas system in 1999, enlarging the system from 26% to 35% of the country’s total geographical area. In November 
1999, the biological corridors were bequeathed as a ‘Gift to the Earth’ from the people of Bhutan. 
  The  Environmental  Assessment  Act  was  passed  by  the  National  Assembly  in  2000  and  the  Regulation  for 
Environmental  Clearance  of  Projects  and  the  Regulation  on  Strategic  Environmental  Assessment  came  into 
eff ect in 2002. The Environmental Assessment Act, 2000, entered into force on 14 July 2000. The Regulation for 
Environmental Clearance of Projects and the Regulation on Strategic Environmental Assessment came into eff ect 
on 4 April 2002. Many conservation milestones were charted as Bhutan passed the National Biodiversity Act, 
2003, and acceded to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and 
Flora and the UN Convention on Combating Desertifi cation (UNCCD) in 2003.

5  At present, two deﬁ nitions exist for the calculation of forest cover in Bhutan. The legal deﬁ nition in the Forest and Nature Conservation 
Act deﬁ nes forest as ‘any land and waterbody, whether or not under vegetative cover, in which no person has acquired a permanent or 
transferable right of use and occupancy, whether such land is located inside or outside the forest boundary pillars, and includes land 
registered in a person’s name as grazing land or woodlot for collection of leaf litter’. While the international deﬁ nition of forests includes 
only  forest  proper  and  scrub  forest,  the  legal  deﬁ nition  includes  woodlot  for  collection  of  leaf  litter,  pastureland,  and  waterbodies. 
It  is  noted  that  the  Ministry  of Agriculture  uses  both  these  deﬁ nitions  in  different  contexts—for  prevention  of  encroachments  and 
management of forest area, the legal deﬁ nition is used, whereas for resource assessment, the international deﬁ nition is adopted.

the  implementation  of  the  Act,  the  Regulation 
for  the  Environmental  Clearance  of  Projects  and

was adopted in 2002. The National Environment 
Commission  (NEC)  has  issued  guidelines  for  a

Forest conservation and forest regeneration
In Bhutan, forests are developed using the principle 
of  natural  forests. The  forest  area  that  is  cleared 
is  left  untouched  for  the  regeneration  of  forest 
naturally.  This  policy  is  followed  to  retain  the 
composition and nature of natural forest. Plantation 
of outside species is not encouraged. However, in 
rural areas that are close to settlements, community 
social  forestry  is  now  being  encouraged.  June  2 
is  celebrated  as ‘Social  Forestry  Day’  every  year, 
which encourages afforestation.
  Transmission network needs large area of land 
to  establish  the  network,  and  efforts  are  needed 
to  keep  it  safe  from  forest  ﬁ res.  Mainly  the  land 
around  the  tower  is  cleared,  and  once  electrical 
lines  are  installed,  green  cover  is  regenerated  in 
most of the area. Pruning and cutting are done to 
maintain the clarity and visibility between the trees 
and transmission lines. 
  Forests  are  also  important  to  maintain  the 
watershed  areas  and  reduce  the  erosion  of  land, 
which ultimately affects the silting of hydropower 
plants and river basins.
impacts.  Situated  in  one  of  the  most  seismically 
active  zones  of  the  world,  Bhutan  faces  continual 
threat of earthquakes. Flash ﬂ oods and landslides 
are  annual  occurrences,  which  cause  signiﬁ cant 
losses  to  lives  and  damage  to  property.6  IPCC 
(2007)  reiterates  that  settlements  in  mountain 
regions are at enhanced risk to glacial lake outburst 
ﬂ oods,  or  GLOFs,  caused  by  melting  glaciers.  A 
note on climate extreme events is given in Box 5.
  The  most  likely  climatic  events  in  Bhutan 
are  increased  GLOF  events  and  ﬂ ooding.  Also, 
increased  precipitation  in  areas  without  proper 
drainage  systems  can  cause  soil  instabilities  and, 
consequently, landslides and ﬂ ash ﬂ oods. The ﬁ rst 
National Communication (NATCOM) of Bhutan 
identiﬁ es six key areas vulnerable to climate change. 
These include forests and biodiversity, agriculture, 
water resources, GLOFs, health, and landslides. 
  The agriculture and hydropower sectors are the 
most vulnerable owing to their innate dependency 
on the monsoon and temperature patterns. As more 
than  70%  of  the  Bhutanese  population  depends 
on subsistence farming, crop failure and stress on 
livestock  rearing  will  affect  the  most  vulnerable 
communities  in  the  rural  areas.  Uncertainty 
associated  with  the  timing  of  monsoons  adds  to 
the  vulnerability  of  the  farming  community. The 
main cash crops grown by farmers (rice, potatoes, 
chillies, apples, and oranges) are extremely sensitive 
to water and temperature variations (NEC 2006). 
The  presence  of  mountainous  topography  and 
scattered settlements implies high costs for social 
services and development of infrastructure, which 
add to the climate vulnerability of the country. 
Potential impacts of changing climatic 
conditions on the energy sector
Despite  Bhutan  being  a  low  contributor  to  the 
global  emissions,  climate  change  is  likely  to  have 
adverse  impacts  on  the  country,  spanning  all 
sectors of the economy and impacting livelihoods 
and well-being at large. Several studies project the 
impacts  of  climate  change  to  be  severe  in  fragile 
ecosystems such as mountainous regions. As a least 
developed country situated in a mountain ecosystem 
and  owing  to  its  limited  coping  capacity,  Bhutan 
is  doubly  vulnerable  to  possible  climate  change

Adaptation and mitigation options
The  National  Adaptation  Programme  of  Action 
identiﬁ es least-cost options (economic, social, and 
environmental) based on the use of local resources 
for  adaptation  to  climate  change. There  are  also 
several  ‘no-regrets’  strategies.  These  are  usually 
targeted on the most severe effects and the greatest 
vulnerabilities  to  climate  change.  Investments 
in  such  options  essentially  present  ‘win-win’ 
solutions, since they have ancillary beneﬁ ts, apart 
from  avoiding  direct  climate-related  costs.  Some 
adaptation measures suggested for the country to 
address various hazards are listed in Table 2. 
  These measures will require the development of 
information and research systems to better monitor 
and  understand  the  impacts  of  climate  change 
as  well  as  assess  signiﬁ cant  capacity  building  of 
relevant  institutions  in  the  country  and  climate-
sensitive  sectors,  and 
inform  the  vulnerable 
population  on  climate  change  and  adaptation 
issues  have  been 
options.  Several  of  these 
disasters  can  hamper  production,  leading  to  the 
reduction of exports, which will ultimately impact 
economic  growth  (Alam  and  Tshering  2004). 
Changes in the climate system have both direct and 
indirect  implications  on  the  hydrological  regime. 
An increase in rainfall intensity may increase run-
off  and  rates  of  soil  erosion  on  cleared  land  and 
may  also  accelerate  sedimentation  in  the  existing 
water supply network or reservoirs. 
Increase  in  temperature  will  result  in  the 
retreat of glaciers, increasing the volume of lakes, 
ultimately  leading  to  GLOFs.  Possible  impacts 
of  GLOFs  in  Bhutan  include  disruption  of  river 
ﬂ ows  and  changes  in  sediment  yield,  thereby 
impacting  hydropower  generation  and  water 
supply;  destructing  settlements,  infrastructure, 
and  agricultural  land;  and  leading  to  the  loss  of 
biodiversity,  apart  from  other  impacts  on  human 
lives downstream.

GOVERNANCE OF ENERGY
The energy sector needs to be governed for meeting 
social, environmental, and growth objectives linked 
to  energy  while  providing  conditions  that  are 
conducive to private investment, thus empowering 
local  governments  and  communities  to  play  a 
proactive role in managing energy systems.
In  Bhutan,  the  Bhutan  Power  Corporation 
(BPC)  is  responsible  for  the  construction  and 
maintenance of the transmission and distribution 
network in the country. Additionally, the BPC also 
owns and operates small and micro power plants. 
Major  power  plants  like Tala,  Chukha,  Kurichu, 
and Basochhu are operated by independent power 
corporations  or  authorities.  The  Department 
of  Energy  (DoE)  has  brought  these  generating 
companies under one umbrella by creating larger 
Druk Green Power Corporation Ltd (DGPC).
  Some  of  the  issues  that  would  need  to  be 
factored  in  while  determining  structural  reforms 
in the energy sector are as follows.
#
 
Structure of the energy sector
One  important  aspect  of  governance  is  the 
ownership and structure of the energy sector and 
its regulation. For much of the 20th century and 
in most countries, network utilities were vertically 
and  horizontally  integrated  state  monopolies. 
The  reasons  for  public  control  of  infrastructure 
were  many—the  sector’s  economic  importance, 
a  desire  to  protect  public  interest  in  industries 
supplying  essential  services,  concerns  about 
private  monopolies,  and  the  belief  that  the  large 
investments  required  for  infrastructure  creation 
could  only  be  augmented  from  public  resources. 
However, 
state-owned 
monopolies  was  far  from  satisfactory,  whether  in 
terms  of  efﬁ cient  and  cost-effective  delivery  of 
services  or  in  the  attainment  of  universal  service 
obligations. The  1990s  saw  a  dramatic  change  in 
views  on  how  network  utilities  should  be  owned, 
organized,  and  regulated,  with  much  emphasis 
on  the  efﬁ ciency  beneﬁ ts  of  competition  and 
privatization.  However,  over  a  period  of  time,  a 
strong  need  has  emerged  to  qualify  the  beneﬁ ts 
of the new model and develop clear guidelines on 
how it should work (World Bank 2004). 
  One of the key messages that emerged from the 
experience of the last decade is that network utilities 
encompass distinct activities with entirely different 
economic  characteristics.  Electricity  generation 
and  distribution  may  be  potentially  competitive 
segments, but transmission is a natural monopoly 
State  of  network 
facilities  Unbundling  and 
introduction  of  competition  require  mature 
well-developed  network  facilities,  minimizing 
the  need  for  new  investments  wherein  the 
incentive problems are more likely as compared 
to  potentially  competitive 
like 
distribution.  In  case  of  Bhutan,  as  discussed 
in  Chapter  4,  network  facilities  still  require 
considerable expansion and investment.

Institutional 
monopoly  to  competition  or  the  co-existence 
of  the  two  forms  in  different  segments  of 
the  sector  plays  a  critical  role.  Regulatory 
requirements in the latter systems are likely to be 
far more complex, requiring strong institutional 
capacity.
Proﬁ le  of  consumers  The  general  economic 
status  of  consumers  and  their  ability  to  pay 
are  important  determinants  of  the  success  of 
privatization.  Private  investment  may  not  be 
forthcoming  in  cases  where  the  government 
wants  to  provide  energy  at  lifeline  tariffs  to  a 
large  section  of  consumers,  as  is  the  case  in 
Bhutan, unless the private investors are assured 
of a reasonable rate of return.

before  granting  any  further  licenses,  keeping  in 
mind their stipulated energy demand and available 
supply options during the lean seasons.
  The  setting  up  of  industries  needs  to  be 
determined  within  an  overall  environmentally 
sustainable  framework.  Promotion  of  industries 
should be such that aspects such as available power, 
export  of  power,  utilization  of  export  proceeds, 
employment generation, value addition, trade, and 
alternative patterns of industrial growth are carefully 
considered.  In  the  existing  subsidized  regime  for 
the industrial sector, provision of subsidized power 
to  the  energy-intensive  sector  may  be  at  the  cost 
of revenues forgone from exports. Integrating the 
opportunity  cost  in  supplying  to  the  industrial 
sector,  it  is  recommended  that  niche  industries 
be  encouraged  in  Bhutan,  which  utilize  natural 
resources,  along  with  other  industries  that  can 
function with minimal energy. A note on viability 
of power-intensive industries is given in Box 6.
  The existing tariff regime should also be modiﬁ ed 
so  as  to  recover  the  complete  economic  cost  of 
providing  electricity.  The  tariff  rationalization 
towards  gradual  removal  of  subsidies  to  high 
voltage  and  medium  voltage  consumers  remains 
important in this respect. It is seen that while the 
average  tariffs  have  been  revised  several  times, 
they  still  remain  highly  subsidized.  In  January 
2003,  the  ﬂ at  rate  system  of  tariff  was  replaced 
by  the  progressive  charge  with  different  rates  for 
the domestic and industrial usage. Accordingly, in 
the low-voltage category, consumers with less than 
80 kWh consumption had to pay Nu 0.60 a unit, 
while  the  rate  for  those  consuming  80–120  kWh 
and  above  200  kWh  per  month  was  ﬁ xed  at  Nu 
0.95 and Nu 1.20 per unit, respectively. The tariff 
for the medium and high voltage was ﬁ xed at Nu 
0.95 and Nu 0.90 per unit, respectively, along with 
the  capacity  charge  of  Nu  54  000  per  megawatt 
per month.
  Though  the  steps  towards  tariff  revisions  have 
reduced the level of subsidies, the burden still remains 
high. The Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA), an 
independent regulator, has been entrusted with the 
responsibility  of  tariff  regulation.  The  Authority 
For  all  these  reasons,  it  may  be  premature  to 
restructure  and  open  up  the  electricity  sector 
in  Bhutan.  On  the  other  hand,  the  DGPC  is 
a  holding  company  responsible  for  building 
additional hydropower projects as well as operating 
and maintaining the built-in projects by 2008, in 
a  manner  similar  to  the  National  Hydro  Power 
Corporation  (NHPC)  established 
in  India.7 
Further,  transmission  and  distribution  are  likely 
to  remain  in  the  public  sector  in  the  foreseeable 
future.  However,  given  the  limited  availability 
of  public  ﬁ nancial  and  administrative  resources,

Tariff regime
The other related issue in terms of ﬁ nancial and cost 
constraints is tariff setting for the sale of electricity 
domestically and for exporting to India. Over the 
years,  Bhutan  has  regulated  the  electricity  prices 
domestically,  setting  them  below  the  economic 
costs  to  fulﬁ l  the  social  obligations  and  promote 
industrial sector. This act is justiﬁ ed in providing 
assistance  to  the  underprivileged  sections  and  in 
promoting regional balanced development, but has 
led to increased inefﬁ ciencies in the consumption 
patterns  of  energy.  Coupled  with  this  is  the  lack 
of  demand  side  management  (DSM)  measures, 
which have further resulted in inefﬁ cient usage of 
the available resources.
  The  prevalent  low  tariffs  have  also  resulted  in 
subsidizing the inefﬁ ciencies in the industrial sector. 
While  the  pricing  policies  have  been  designed  to 
strengthen the industrial base in Bhutan, provision 
of subsidized electricity in several ways can harm 
the  economic  progress  if  it  is  unable  to  generate 
adequate  forward  linkages  to  compete  with  the 
export proceeds of sale of power to India. In the 
current  situation  of  low  electricity  tariffs,  while

Electricity tariff s have largely been aff ordable to stimulate the industrial sector in Bhutan. The industrial sector 
consumes 26.4% of the total energy and is the largest consumer of electricity in the country; its consumption is 
pegged at 420 MU, which is about 64.7% of total electricity consumed by the industrial sector in 2005. The main 
manufacturing industries in Bhutan are Penden Cement Authority Ltd (PCAL), Bhutan Ferro Alloys Ltd (BFAL), and 
Bhutan Calcium Carbide Ltd (BCCL). Besides these, Druk Cement Company Ltd (DCCL), Druk Iron and Steel Plant 
(DISL), and Bhutan Steels Ltd (BSL) have also been set up, which consume almost 95% of the electricity used by 
the sector. 
  As  seen  from  the  energy  demand  analysis  for  the  BAU  (business-as-usual)  scenario,  with  the  upcoming 
industries that have recently received licenses, the energy demand from the sector is bound to increase in the 
coming years. This increased demand level would lead to a serious confl ict with the total available supply, which 
has to meet the growing needs of other sectors as well, besides industrial sector. Besides the availability factor, 
viability of the power industries is also dependent on the cost of available supply. With the prevalent low tariff  
regime for the industrial sector, industries are viable options. However, with the phasing out of subsidies, as 
proposed by the Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA), their existence might come under threat.
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION OF 
ELECTRICITY
The power transmission and distribution network 
in Bhutan is managed by the BPC and comprises 
two main grids, the western grid and the eastern 
grid,  each  of  them  covering  parts  of  eight 
Dzongkhags. 
would determine the tariff as per the tariff policy, 
with  public  announcement  and  dissemination. 
The  overriding  objective  of  the  tariff  policy  has 
been gradual phasing out of the subsidies—a 10% 
increase  in  power  tariff  is  proposed  annually  for 
the next ﬁ ve years till 2012.
  Besides  tariff  revision,  another  option  that 
could  be  explored  in  the  context  of  Bhutan  is 
cost  plus  tariff.  In  case  the  industry  wishes  to 
overdraw  electricity,  the  regulator  could  consider 
the option of providing it at a cost above the actual 
tariff rate, subject to the availability and fulﬁ lment 
of legal requirements. The other alternative could 
be to charge the second tariff to the level of export 
proceeds. 
System planning
The  network  can  be  divided  into  a  bulk  power 
transmission  system  for  supplying  power  from 
Bhutan to India and an area supply or sub-station 
system  for  supplying  domestic  loads  (WRMP 
2004).

components of the energy management 
plan in a comprehensive manner. The 
analysis  carried  out  in  the  earlier 
chapters has identiﬁ ed and quantiﬁ ed current and 
future needs of the energy sector, and accordingly, 
certain  strategies  have  been  recommended  with 
probable impact analysis.
INTEGRATED ENERGY MANAGEMENT PLAN 
COMPONENTS
The  previous  chapters  discussed  speciﬁ c  supply 
and  demand  side  strategies  for  Bhutan.  This 
chapter  examines  some  overarching  issues  that 
cut  across  these  strategies  and,  in  a  sense,  link 
them  with  the  larger  development  objectives  of 
the country. 
  The  national  development  targets,  as  reﬂ ected 
in the Ninth Plan and Bhutan 2020, closely match 
the Millennium Development Goals and reﬂ ect a 
strong  national  political  commitment  to  socio-
economic  development.  Energy  systems  need 
to  be  planned  in  such  a  way  that  they  promote 
these objectives, with a focus on poverty reduction 
and  balanced  regional  development,  taking  into 
account  the  special  needs  of  remote  and  rural 
communities.  This  will  require  an  emphasis  on 
small-  and  medium-sized  units  and  reduced 
dependence  on  the  (hydropower)  construction 
industry  such  that  the  employment  generating 
capacity of industry is enhanced. Also, there is an 
urgent need to revive agriculture through a focus 
on  value-added  products  and  rural  development, 
since over 60% of the country’s labour force is still 
dependent on agriculture. 
INSTITUTIONAL SET-UP 
The  analysis  of  the  energy  sector  of  Bhutan 
reveals that there is no focal ministry/department 
to undertake the coordination of all the activities 
related to energy. Moreover, the relevant information 
is  scattered 
on  various  energy  sources/fuels 
along  various  sources  because  single  source  of 
information  is  not  available.  As  far  as  renewable 
energy  and  energy  conservation/efﬁ ciency  are 
concerned, there is very limited awareness among 
the  stakeholders,  particularly  the  users. This  lack 
of  awareness  hampers  their  ability  to  make  an 
informed and judicious choice. 
  The existing institutional infrastructure for the 
energy sector in Bhutan is shown in Figure 1.
  A brief note on different institutions presented

the  inclusion  of  the  power  and  mining  sector,  it 
has  been  ofﬁ cially  designated  as  the  Ministry  of 
Economic  Affairs  from  17  October  2007.  The 
Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  comprises  four 
technical  departments,  namely,  the  departments

Considering  the  facts  that  (1)  any  surplus 
electricity  is  a  potential  source  of  revenue  earner 
through  exports  and  (2)  the  preservation  of  its 
pristine environment is country’s topmost priority, 
it is evident that much more emphasis would have 
to be laid on (1) new renewable energy resources 
(such  as  biomass  and  solar)  and  (2)  energy 
conservation and energy efﬁ ciency. To attain these 
goals, the present Renewable Energy Department 
(RED)  may  be  converted  to  Sustainable  Energy 
Department (SED).    
  The SED would, therefore, make the endeavour 
of  mainstreaming  renewable  energy  and  energy 
efﬁ ciency within the country. The SED would also 
help  in  taking  an  integrated  view  of  the  energy 
situation,  wherein  renewable  energy  and  energy 
conservation play complementary roles. The broad 
functions of the SED will include the following.
#
Bhutan Power Corporation
Bhutan  Power  Corporation  Ltd  (BPC)  was 
launched  as  a  public  utility  on  1  July  2002,  with 
the mandate of distributing electricity throughout 
the country and also providing transmission access 
for generating stations for domestic supply as well 
as export. One of BPC’s basic mandate was to not 
only  ensure  that  electricity  is  available  to  all  the 
citizens  but  to  also  make  sure  that  it  is  reliable, 
adequate,  and  above  all,  within  the  means  of  all 
consumers.
  Given  the  complexities  of  different  energy  sub-
sectors  in  the  country,  it  is  desirable  to  take  an 
integrated and holistic approach to address myriad 
challenges that the country is facing in the ﬁ eld of 
energy. It is, therefore, suggested to bring petroleum 
as  well  as  coal  under  the  purview  of  the  DoE, 
besides  electricity,  renewable  energy,  and  energy 
conservation/efﬁ ciency.  In  order  to  take  on  these 
wider responsibilities, the DoE may be transformed 
into  a  full-ﬂ edged  Ministry  of  Energy.    Indeed, 
Good  Governance  Plus  document  also  mentions

look  after  not  only  the  hydropower  energy  and 
renewable  energy  but  also  policies  regarding 
import of petroleum fuels and coal. Thus, different 
departments/divisions may be created to look after 
the speciﬁ c areas, as mentioned subsequently.
 
The  SED  would  formulate  guidelines,  policy

approach  would  help  in  providing  solutions 
appropriate to the Dzongkhags concerned.  
It  may  be  desirable  to  have  ‘decentralized 
institutional  set-up’  at  the  Dzongkhag  level. 
Rather than creating new agencies, the relevant 
existing  department(s), 
the  Planning 
Department, may be designated and empowered 
to  carry  out  activities  related  to  renewable 
energy and energy efﬁ ciency.
The  SED  may  undertake  setting  up  of  energy

RECOMMENDATIONS
IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES
With  vast  potential  available  for  hydropower 
generation,  use  of  electricity  for  mass  transport 
and electric/hybrid vehicles for personal transport 
are viable options for Bhutan.
  Hybrid (petrol–electric) and electric vehicles are 
now  being  developed  by  many  major  automobile 
manufacturers worldwide. 
  Use of electric vehicle by the individuals as well 
as  for  the  public  transport  system  may  reduce 
the  burden  of  import  of  petrol  and  diesel  on 
the  Bhutanese  economy.  It  is  observed  that  the 
replacement of personnel petrol vehicle and some 
public transport systems such as mini buses in the 
city like Thimphu with the electric vehicles can not 
only reduce the petrol consumption of the city but 
will also help in reducing pollution.
  Total  petrol  consumption  in  2005  was  13  775 
kilolitres, which is projected to increase to 34 105 
kilolitres in 2015 and to 51 673 kilolitres in 2020 
under the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. Petrol 
is mainly consumed by light transport vehicles such 
as  cars  and  two-wheelers.  In  2000,  total  number 
of light vehicles was 7438, which increased to 17 
712 in 2006. A projection has been made based on 
the trend from 2000 to 2006, and it is found that 
the  number  of  light  vehicles  will  be  increased  to 
48 452 in 2015 and to 73 680 in 2020 under the 
BAU scenario. To reduce the petrol consumption 
by vehicles, the government may promote the use 
of electric vehicles by citizens. An analysis on the 
potential savings in petrol accrued by using electric 
vehicles is presented in the subsequent section.

Potential for petrol saving by using electric 
vehicles
Following assumptions have been made to calculate 
the estimated petrol savings. 
#
Electricity  consumed  during  one  full  charging 
of the electric vehicle is 9 kWh.
Distance travelled by electric vehicles in one full 
charging is 80 km. Mileage of petrol vehicle is 
12 km per litre.
Price of electricity is Rs. 2.00 per kWh.
Number of days the vehicles are used in a year 
is 365 days. 
Price of petrol is Rs 45.00 per litre.
Average run per day per vehicle is about 15 km.
#
#
#
#
#
It is suggested that initially, about 1000 personal 
electric  vehicles  may  be  introduced  by  2012  and 
then  up  to  5000  vehicles  by  2015  and  up  to 
15 000 vehicles may be introduced by 2020. Based 
on  the  assumptions  given  above,  saving  in  the 
amount of petrol is calculated. It is estimated that 
by  following  this  approach,  total  saving  of  petrol 
by  the  year  2015  will  be  about  2281  kilolitres, 
and  by  2020,  it  will  be  about  6843  kilolitres. 
The  replacement  of  petrol  vehicles  with  electric 
vehicles  will  reduce  the  petrol  demand  in  future 
and  will  increase  the  total  electricity  demand  in 
Bhutan.  Based  on  the  above  assumptions,  it  is 
estimated  that  by  2015,  Bhutan  may  save  about  
Nu 94 million per year, and by 2020, it will save 
about Nu 280 million per year.
Economy of the use of electric vehicles
An analysis has been carried out for comparing the 
economy in the use of petrol vehicle and electric 
vehicle. The result is presented in Figure 3, which 
shows  the  cost  in  Nu/km/person  for  different 
occupancies of the vehicle. For the most common 
case  of  two  occupancy,  the  use  of  petrol  vehicle 
costs  about  Rs.  1.50  per  person  per  kilometre, 
while the electric vehicle costs about Re 0.11 per 
person per kilometre (Figure 3).

RECOMMENDATIONS
CDM potential of using electric vehicles
There is a good potential for Clean Development 
Mechanism  (CDM)  by  using  electric  vehicles. 
The  use  of  electric  vehicle  will  also  help  Bhutan 
in  keeping  its  environment  clean  and  reducing 
the  greenhouse  (GHG)  emission  because  of  the 
reduction  in  petrol  consumption  and  the  use 
of  clean  electric  power,  which  is  generated  by 
hydropower projects. It is estimated that by 2015, 
Bhutan can help in reducing about 5656 tCO2 per 
year,  and  by  2020,  about  16  969  tCO2  will  be 
reduced per year by replacing petrol vehicles with 
electric vehicles. 
commuting  between  ofﬁ ce  and  home.  Various 
organizations  may  also  provide  charging  plugs  in 
the  parking  place  of  the  ofﬁ ce  building,  so  that 
employees may charge their vehicles whenever they 
want to. This charging facility may be available on 
paying  nominal  fees  or  it  may  be  provided  free 
to  the  employees  to  promote  the  use  of  electric 
vehicles in initial phase.
  Charging  stations  may  be  set  up  at  various 
parking  places  and  the  charging  facility  can  be 
provided  free  of  cost  as  a  subsidy  to  the  electric 
vehicle owners. 
  The  government  may  introduce  mini  buses 
running on electricity within Thimphu city and later 
on from Thimphu to Paro. It is, therefore, suggested 
to  develop  a  master  plan  for  the  introduction  of 
electric/hybrid vehicles in Bhutan.
Strategy for the implementation of electric 
vehicles
The  implementation  of  electric  vehicles  can  be

TARIFF DESIGN
Tariff design
Tariff  design,  from  the  point  of  view 
customer  chooses  the  option  that  best  meets  his 
requirements.
of  an  operator,  is  aimed  at  proﬁ t 
maximization, while the government’s 
interest  is  welfare  maximization  and 
making  available  affordable  service  to  the  poor. 
To  maximize  proﬁ ts,  the  operator  seeks  prices 
that equate marginal revenue (deﬁ ned as the extra 
revenue  the  operator  receives  when  it  increases 
output  by  one  unit)  and  marginal  costs.  Different 
types of options exist for designing tariffs, and some 
of them are discussed in the subsequent sections.
Peak load pricing
Peak  load  pricing  is  a  kind  of  pricing  variation, 
wherein  the  operator  would  maximize  his  proﬁ ts 
by  charging  higher  prices  during  the  peak  hours 
and  lower  prices  during  the  off-peak  hours. The 
peak load pricing, however, requires sophisticated 
measurement  of  customer  usage,  with  advanced 
metering technologies for energy and water sectors. 
The  cost  of  implementing  these  technologies, 
however,  must  be  weighed  against  the  welfare 
gains  for  metering  before  pursuing  the  usage  of 
peak load pricing.
MARGINAL COST PRICING
In  case  of  competitive  environment,  marginal 
revenue equals marginal costs. This marginal cost 
pricing  maximizes  welfare,  with  the  interest  of 
the  operator  coinciding  with  the  interests  of  the 
government. 
REGULATION OF THE ENERGY SECTOR
Irrespective of the structure of the sector, there is a 
need to introduce an arms-length energy regulator, 
combining the powers of rule making (legislative) and 
implementation  and  enforcement  (executive)  with 
quasi-judicial powers of review and appeal against 
their  orders  (judicial).  Independent  regulation  is 
required to safeguard consumer interests, especially 
those  of  vulnerable  groups  and  geographically 
distant consumers, promote efﬁ ciency and economy 
in the sector, accelerate decision-making, facilitate 
investors and others in planning and raising ﬁ nances 
for  the  long-term  investments,  and  supply  quality 
services at economic prices. 
  The  Bhutan  Electricity  Authority  (BEA)  has 
been  established  under  the  Electricity Act,  2001, 
to play the role of a regulator in the development of 
the energy sector. Some of the important functions 
of the Authority as per the Act include development 
of  regulations,  standards,  codes,  principles  and 
procedures;  process  applications;  modifying  and 
revoking licences and monitoring the performance 
of  licensees  and  their  compliance;    determining/
Deviation from marginal cost pricing: multipart 
prices
In case the operator possesses some market power, 
its  proﬁ t  maximization  prices  would  exceed  the 
marginal cost, resulting in welfare loss unlike the 
perfectly  competitive  environment.  An  example 
of  a  deviation  from  the  marginal  cost  pricing 
is  the  multipart  tariffs,  wherein  the  operator 
charges  separate  prices  for  different  elements 
of  the  service  unlike  in  linear  tariff,  wherein  a 
single price is charged for the service. A common 
example  of  multipart  tariff  is  the  two-part  tariff 
in the electricity sector, where the customer pays 
a  monthly  fee  for  access  and  a  usage  fee  for  the 
consumption of electricity. 
Optional tariffs
Optional tariffs are closely related to the multipart 
tariff,  where  the  operator  offers  the  customer 
a  menu  of  pricing  plans,  amongst  which  the

tariffs;  prescribing 
approving/reviewing 
and 
collecting fees, charges or royalties from licensees; 
imposing  ﬁ nes,  sanctions  or  penalties  for  any 
breach  of  provisions  of  this  Act;  establishing  a 
dispute  resolution  process;  and  settling  disputes 
and  other  duties  or  responsibilities  delegated  by 
the minister.
  While the BEA can play the role of a regulator 
in  the  short  term,  experience  worldwide  has 
underscored  the  need  for  rule-making,  decision-
making  or  adjudicative  functions  to  be  under  an 
independent regulator outside of the government 
and  the  legal  system.  Government  departments 
may  be  perceived  as  not  being  able  to  provide 
insulation  from  external  inﬂ uences.  Also,  it  may 
not be feasible to develop courts for different kinds 
of  expertise  required.  In  addition,  independent 
regulators  can  also  bring  in  more  stability  since 
they are not concerned with electoral politics but 
have  to  keep  the  interest  of  the  public  in  mind. 
Further, entrusting price regulation to a regulatory 
body also has major advantages for governments—
it  provides  insulation  from  politically  unpopular 
pricing  decisions  that  need  to  be  taken  in  the 
interest  of  the  industry  and  creates  a  source  of 
expertise. 
To  progressively  reﬂ ect  cost  of  supply  of 
electricity and also reduce and eliminate cross-
subsidy within a speciﬁ ed time frame.
To  ensure  that  tariff  is  sensitive  to  the  type  of 
consumer,  time  of  supply,  area  of  supply,  and 
nature/purpose for which supply is required. 
To promote renewable energy through incentives 
built into tariffs. 
#
#
#
Some  other  important  functions  of  the  regulator 
would be as follows.
#
Promoting  energy  efﬁ ciency  and  enforcing 
various  energy  efﬁ ciency  measures  and 
developing  infrastructure/standards/codes  for 
energy efﬁ ciency.  
Promoting  the  growth  of  renewable  and  non-
conventional sources of energy, including solar, 
mini-micro hydel, and so on. Regulator can look 
into the utilization/creation of additional funds 
to  support  the  development  of  the  renewable 
energy sector for electricity generation. 
Bridging  the  gap  in  people’s  understanding 
of  the  sector,  including  the  demand/supply 
situation  and  the  accompanying  imperatives, 
implications,  and  status  of  reforms  through 
public  hearings  and  proactive 
information 
dissemination, which are not merely perfunctory. 
This understanding is crucial for public buy-in 
of  reforms,  minimizing  uncertainties  in  public 
reactions,  and  creating  an  environment  that  is 
more  conducive  for  foreign  direct  investment 
(FDI).
#
#
In  the  foreseeable  future,  the  government  will 
remain  the  largest  player  in  the  electricity  sector 
in the country (likely in the form of Druk Green 
Power  Corporation).  Here,  the  regulator  should 
closely monitor the capital and revenue expenditure 
of the incumbent  utility and ensure that costs are 
not  padded  so  as  to  get  higher  tariffs  or  that  the 
utility is not unduly burdened with the costs of the 
government’s social obligations. 
  Simultaneously,  the  regulator  would  need 
to  identify  segments  where  private  capital  and 
competition  can  be  introduced.  The  regulator 
would need to ensure the harmonious co-existence 
of the private sector (in generation) with the natural 
monopoly segment, transmission, likely to remain 
in  the  public  sector,  with  particular  attention  to 
non-discriminatory access to incumbent facilities.  
  One of the key areas that a regulator would need 
to focus on is tariff determination. The following 
issues are of importance.
#
 
The  success  of  the  regulator  in  meeting  these 
objectives  will  require  capacity,  transparency, 
strong  political  and 
accountability,  and  a 
administrative commitment to their effectiveness. 
DECENTRALIZED ENERGY GOVERNANCE
Bhutan  has  a  well-designed 
for 
decentralized planning process at the Dzongkhag 
and Gewog level. The government has established 
Dzongkhag Yargay Tshochung  (DYT),  or  district 
development  committees,  giving  the  Dzongkhags 
administrative  responsibilities. At  the  block  level, 
Gewog Yargay Tshochung (GYT) has been formed 
framework 
To set multi-year tariff principles.

TARIFF DESIGN
The collection of tariff and maintaining accounts 
of  tariff  collection  are  the  responsibilities  of  the 
community, and a village committee is set up for 
this purpose. This experiment has been successful 
so far, and in future, such decentralized governance 
of small plants should be encouraged. 
  Bhutan is also planning to develop FDI policy 
for hydropower development, which will encourage 
IPP  and  captive  power  production.  A  whole 
range  of  issues  needs  to  be  addressed  for  this  to 
materialize. The DoE has suggested change in its 
current organization structure to include additional 
responsibilities such as negotiating contracts with 
private producers, marketing hydropower projects, 
and so on.  
for devolving administrative responsibilities to the 
blocks. Measures are also being taken to improve 
the resource base and capacity of these bodies. In 
the  energy  sector,  these  local  bodies  can  play  a 
major role in decentralized mini hydro projects and 
in operation and maintenance of local distribution 
lines, involving the local community in billing and 
collection.
In  the  1990s,  small  hydropower  plants  were 
managed  by  the  community;  however,  due  to 
various  constraints  such  as  lack  of  capacity  and 
technical  know-how  required  to  operate  and 
maintain  these  plants  at  community  level,  these 
plants were brought under the control of the Bhutan 
Power Corporation (BPC). However, recently built 
70-kW  mini  hydroplant  at  Chendenbji  and  100-
kW  hydroplant  at  Sengor  are  being  transferred 
to  community  for  operation  and  maintenance, 
with  technical  backstopping    and  support  being 
provided by the Department of Energy (DoE)/BPC.
 
Ideally, regulator should look into these matters 
as an independent authority and develop suitable 
guidelines,  regulation,  and  so  on  and  advise  the 
government on  policy and rules, regulations, and 
acts.

BIOMASS DENSIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES
Biomass densification technologies
Many  non-woody  biomass  residues 
Table 1
cannot  be  used  efﬁ ciently,  as 
they  have 
low  bulk  densities. 
For  example,  the  bulk  density  of 
majority of the agro-residues lies in the low range of 
50–200 kg/m3 (Table 1) as compared to 800 kg/m3 
for the coal of the same size. This necessitates huge 
storage space. This is combined with difﬁ culty in 
handling and higher transportation cost. All these 
factors make them uneconomical as a marketable 
commodity  for  their  widespread  utilization  over 
longer distances. Also, low bulk densities and loose 
nature  of  available  biomass  are  associated  with 
faster burning of fuels, resulting in higher ﬂ ue gas 
losses  (lower  operating  thermal  efﬁ ciencies)  and 
emissions  in  the  form  of  ﬂ y  ash  or  particulates 
in the atmosphere. This makes them poor quality 
biomass fuel. In order to improve the marketability 
of  the  available  loose  biomass  and  exploit  this 
renewable  and  sustainable  source  of  energy,  pre-
processing becomes necessary.
  Densiﬁ cation of biomass can be done by using 
technology,  which 
briquetting  or  pelletizing 
compresses  loose  biomass  into  densiﬁ ed  form 
called briquettes or pellets. This takes care of the 
low bulk density of biomass and helps in reducing 
transportation and storage cost and improves the 
quality  of  biomass  so  that  it  could  be  used  as  a 
better combustible fuel. 
from 
  Densiﬁ ed  briquette/pellet  produced 
biomass is a fairly good substitute for coal, lignite, 
and ﬁ rewood, and offers several advantages.  
Densiﬁ ed briquette is a renewable and sustainable 
source of energy. It has the following advantages.

APPROPRIATE BIOMASS RESIDUE FOR 
BRIQUETTING
Almost  all  types  of  biomass  can  be  densiﬁ ed. 
However,  there  are  many  factors  that  need  to 
be  considered  before  biomass  qualiﬁ es  as  an 
appropriate  feedstock  for  briquetting. The  main 
characteristics  of  appropriate  biomass  residue

for  briquetting  are  described  in  the  subsequent 
sections.
making  the  bonding  during  compaction  strong. 
Binders,  that  is,  high  viscous  bonding  media, 
such as tar and other molecular organic liquid or 
cow  dung,  are  used  in  low-pressure  compaction 
to enhance adhesion among biomass particles by 
creating  solid–liquid  bridges.  Lignin  in  biomass 
helps  in  creating  such  bonds  due  to  its  softening 
at higher temperatures and its adsorption on solid 
particle  layers,  which  can  contact,  or  penetrate 
into,  each  other.  The  strength  of  the  resulting 
agglomeration depends on the type of interaction 
and the material characteristics. Selected important 
characteristics and their signiﬁ cance are discussed 
in the following sections.
Moisture content
Higher moisture content poses problem in grinding, 
and higher energy is required for drying operation. 
Therefore,  biomass  with  lower  moisture  content, 
preferably  below  10%–15%,  is  a  more  attractive 
feedstock for briquetting.
Ash content and composition
Majority  of  biomass  residues  (except  rice  husk 
with  20%  ash)  have  low  ash  content,  but  they 
contain  higher  percentages  of  alkaline  (especially 
potash)  minerals.  They  also  contribute  towards 
lowering  sintering  temperature,  leading  to  ash 
deposition,  and  higher  ash  content  increases  the 
slagging  tendency,  which  becomes  more  intense 
in biomass with more than 4% ash.
Effect of particle size
Granular  biomass  material  of  size  6-8  mm,  with 
about  10%–20%  powdery  (<  4  mesh)  material, 
normally gives best results. Though high-pressure 
(1000–1500  bar)  compaction  machines  such 
as  piston  press  or  screw  extruder  can  produce 
briquettes  from  larger  particle  size  biomass,  they 
can  lead  to  the  choking  of  the  entrance  to  ram 
or  die.  Condensation  of  vapour  released  from 
larger particles on ﬁ ner particles can create lumps, 
affecting free ﬂ ow. However, only ﬁ ner material is 
not always good due to low density and ﬂ owability, 
and  the  presence  of  particles  of  varying  size 
improves  the  packing  dynamics,  contributing  to 
higher strength. 
Flow characteristic
Finer  granular  material  with  uniform  size  ﬂ ows 
easily in fuel hoppers and storage bins/silos. 
  Thus, some of the appropriate biomass material 
for  briquetting  includes  saw  dust,  coffee  husk, 
groundnut shell, pulverized mustard stalk, cotton 
sticks, and so on. 
Binding mechanism of densification
Briquetting  is  one  of  the  several  agglomeration 
techniques  used  for  the  densiﬁ cation  of  biomass 
residues. On the basis of compaction, briquetting 
technologies can be classiﬁ ed as follows.
#
Effect of moisture
Moisture  content  is  a  very  critical  factor.  Right 
amount  of  moisture  (7%–10%)  develops  self-
bonding  properties  in  lignocellulosic  substances 
at elevated temperatures and pressures prevailing 
in  piston  press  and  screw  extruder  briquetting 
machines.  Higher  moisture  content  can  result 
in  poor  and  weak  briquettes  with  cracks  due  to 
the  escape  of  steam  and  also  results  in  erratic 
operation  due  to  the  choking  of  feed  ﬂ ow 
because  of  steam  formation.  It  is  also  important 
to  maintain  the  moisture  content  in  input  feed 
material so as to ensure that briquettes produced 
have moisture content higher than the equilibrium 
value, otherwise it would regain moisture from the 
atmosphere, resulting in swelling during briquette 
High pressure compaction
Medium pressure compaction
Low pressure compaction
#
#
Normally,  binders  are  not  required  in  high-  and 
medium-pressure  compaction,  but  sometimes, 
preheating of biomass is carried out to enhance the 
compaction process. In all compaction processes, 
individual  particles  are  pressed  together  in  a 
conﬁ ned volume. In case of biomass, the binding 
mechanism  under  pressure  can  be  divided  into 
cohesion  and  adhesion  forces,  van  der  Waal’s 
attractive  forces  between  solid  particles,  and 
mechanical  interlocking  bonds  under  pressure,

sugar  mill  waste  mud  (commonly  called  as  press 
mud),  jute  waste,  coir  pith,  and  so  on  as  raw 
materials.  All  these  biomass  briquettes,  except 
press  mud,  have  a  caloriﬁ c  value  of  the  order  of 
3800–4000 kcal/kg, which is considered good.
  Commercially,  briquetting  technologies  used 
for biomass without binder include the briquetting 
machine based on

storage  and  transportation  stages,  and  would 
disintegrate when exposed to humid conditions. 
Effect of biomass feed temperature
At higher temperatures, moisture of biomass gets 
converted  into  steam  under  higher  prevailing 
pressures, which hydrolyses the hemicellulose and 
lignin  portion  of  biomass  into  lower  molecular 
carbohydrates,  lignin  products,  sugar  polymers, 
and other derivatives. These act like in situ binding 
material.  Better  compaction,  along  with  higher 
biomass feed temperature and pressure, results in 
briquettes with higher density and strength (Figure 
1). This also softens the ﬁ bres and their resistance 
to  briquetting,  which  results  in  lower  power 
requirements and reduction in wear of the contact 
parts.  However,  the  temperature  should  be  kept 
lower  than  300  °C,  as  beyond  this  temperature, 
decomposition of biomass starts.
  Briquetting can be done with or without a binder 
material.  No  binders  are  generally  required  in 
high-pressure briquetting. Prior to its introduction 
into  the  briquetting  machine,  biomass  has  to  be 
disintegrated  into  small  size  and  then  dried  so 
that the moisture content is in the range of about 
12%–15%. Briquetting plants set up so far in India 
are using saw dust, bamboo dust, groundnut shell, 
mustard  stalk,  cotton  stalk,  coffee  husk,  bagasse, 
#
In  both  the  piston  press  and  screw  press 
technologies,  the  application  of  high  pressure 
increases  the  temperature  of  biomass,  and  lignin 
present  in  the  biomass  liqueﬁ es  and  acts  as  a 
binder. 
Ram-piston press technology
Biomass briquetting using ram-piston technology 
involves drying, grinding, sieving, and compacting. 
Moisture is removed from the loose biomass with 
the  help  of  a  dryer,  and  then  it  is  ground  in  a 
hammer mill grinder. The ground material is then 
separated from the air by using cyclone separator. 
It is then sieved and stored in the bin above hopper 
for ensuring continuous ﬂ ow of biomass material 
into the press. In piston press technology, biomass 
is  punched  into  a  die  by  a  reciprocating  ram  to

produce  briquettes  (Figure  2).  The  ram  moves 
about  250–300  times  per  minute  in  the  process. 
In briquetting machine, the wear of contact parts, 
here, ram and piston, is a major issue and requires 
frequent  maintenance  and/or  replacement.  The 
average  frequencies  of  replacement  for  some  of 
the machine components are 300 hours (for ram, 
scrapper,  and  wear  rings)  and  500  hours  (taper 
and split die, and hammers).

In  India,  commercially  available  piston  press 
briquetting  machines  are  commonly  used  in 
different  parts  of  the  country. They  are  available 
in  different  capacities,  ranging  from  250  kg/
hour  to  2250  kg/hour. Table  2  gives  the  share  of 
various  input  costs  in  the  production  of  biomass 
briquettes. It can be seen that at higher production 
capacities,  the  raw  material  contributes  more  as 
input cost, and the share of other costs diminishes 
due to scale of production. Table 3 gives the power 
requirement for machines with different capacities 
for briquetting various types of biomass materials. 
Power  requirement  is  higher  for  higher  capacity 
machines. Production capacity increases from ﬁ ner 
to coarser to stalky biomass due to increasing pre-
processing  requirement  of  biomass. Wet  biomass

by  burning  part  of  briquettes  in  furnace.  Using 
heated oil obtained in heat exchanger, the biomass 
is  further  preheated  to  about  100–120  °C  so  as 
to minimize wear of the die and improve the true 
density  of  the  briquettes  formed. This  preheated 
material  is  then  fed  to  the  screw  extruder, 
where  revolving  screw  (at  about  600–700  RPM) 
continuously  compacts  the  material  through  a 
tapered  die,  which  is  heated  externally  to  reduce 
friction  between  the  biomass  and  die  surface 
(Figure  3).  The  outer  surface  of  the  briquettes 
obtained  through  this  technology  is  partially 
carbonized and has a hole in the centre. 
  The briquettes extruded using screw press are 
more homogeneous (as output is continuous and 
not in strokes), with better crushing strength and 
combustion  properties  (due  to  large  combustion 
area  per  unit  weight).  Since  outer  surface  of  the 
briquettes  is  carbonized,  it  facilitates  easy  and 
clean ignition, and this impervious layer provides 
protection from moisture ingress, thereby increasing 
the storage life of the briquettes. However, power 
consumption  and  wear  of  screw  are  higher  than 
those experienced in ram-piston-type reciprocating 
machines.

Pelletizing machine
Biomass  with  very  low  bulk  density  is  normally 
densiﬁ ed  using  ﬂ at  die  pelletizing  technique. 
Pelletizing  generally  requires  conditioning  of 
biomass material either by mixing binder or raising 
the temperature of the biomass by direct addition 
of steam. The material is dropped in the pressing 
chamber of the pellet mill, where it builds a carpet 
on the die surface. The rollers roll over this layer 
and  compress  it  through  tapered  die  holes. The 
pressing  force  keeps  on  increasing  during  rolling 
in the direction of die holes. With every roll pass,

a small disc is formed in the die hole, which gets 
attached  to  the  pressed  piece  already  in  the  die 
hole. The plugs are uniformly pushed forward and 
hot pellets are ejected at a temperature of about 50–
90 °C, which are cooled on conveyor belts before 
their storage (Figure 4). Compared to briquetting 
machine,  pellet  mills  are  simpler,  and  since  they 
work with rotary motion, the power consumption 
levels are lower. The processing requirements are 
also relatively less rigid for pelletizing.
LOW-DENSITY BRIQUETTES USING BINDER
In  remote  areas,  for  decentralized  operation,  a 
simple  low-pressure  briquettng  technique  using 
binder  material  like  tar  or  cow  dung  is  generally 
adopted.  The  Energy  and  Resources  Institute 
(TERI), New Delhi, has developed a simple screw 
extruder  (Figure  5)  coupled  to  a  small  motor, 
which  produces  medium-density  briquettes 
(400–600  kg/m3).  The  system  was  operated 
in  village  Dhanwas  in  Haryana  for  converting 
locally  available  agro-residues  (mustard  stalk) 
into  briquettes  (after  manual  preprocessing  like 
chopping  and  pulverizing)  using  cow  dung  as  a 
binder  material.  These  briquettes  were  sold  in 
local  area  as  fuel  substitute  to  coal  in  roadside 
restaurants  (called  dhabas)  and  as  gasiﬁ er  fuel  to 
provide  electricity  to  village  community  and  for 
operating  the  briquetting  machine  (Raman  et  al. 
1993). 
  Recently,  TERI  has  successfully  carried  out 
feasibility  study  for  making  briquettes  from  oil 
reﬁ nery  waste  sludge  by  mixing  it  with  locally 
available  loose  biomass  material. This  would  not 
only  take  care  of  the  waste  disposal  problem  of 
hazardous waste from oil reﬁ neries but also produce 
easy-to-use  briquettes,  which  can  substitute  coal 
in the surrounding region (TERI 2001). 
In IIT Delhi, a simple briquetting plant operated 
by hand mould was developed for making beehive 
charcoal briquette for using it as a clean burning 
fuel,  substituting  charcoal.  Locally  available  leafy 
biomass or pine needles are carbonized 
using simple pyrolyser, which is prepared 
using  200  litres  of  used  oil  barrel. This 
is  then  mixed  with  suitable  binding 
material  like  clay  and  cow  dung,  and 
the mixture is prepared using adequate 
quantity  of  water. This  material  is  then 
pressed  into  hand  mould  to  form  large 
cylindrical  briquettes  of  about  90  mm 
height  and  125  mm  diameter,  with 
several (about 19) parallel vertical holes 
in  it  (Figure  6).  One  person  can  make

INTRODUCTION 
Biomass  can  be  utilized  for  different  purposes 
such  as  cooking,  process  heating,  electricity 
generation, steam generation, mechanical or shaft 
power  applications,  as  well  as  producing  variety 
of  chemicals  as  by-products.  Various  biomass 
conversion processes can be broadly classiﬁ ed into 
the following categories.

of  combustion  is  to  start  the  process,  as  high  (at 
least  550  °C)  temperature  is  required  for  the 
ignition of biomass. However, once ignition takes 
place, it is difﬁ cult to stop the combustion process 
if  sufﬁ cient  air  supply  is  available  till  complete 
combustion  converts  the  biomass  into  residual 
ash. Figure 1 shows the ﬁ re triangle, emphasizing 
essential components like fuel, air, and heat, which 
permit  ﬁ re/combustion  to  continue  to  grow.  Fire 
can be extinguished either by removing fuel or by 
smothering (removing air) or by cooling (spraying 
with water). 
  Biomass  combustion  is  being  used  for  various 
useful  applications  such  as  electricity  generation, 
process heating, and cogeneration (simultaneous, 
sequential  production  of  electricity  and  process 
heat). With  rising  prices  of  fossil  fuels,  biomass 
is  gaining  importance,  and  there  is  increasing 
reﬁ nement of the biomass combustion process to 
exploit its energy content. In order to harness the 
energy  content  of  the  biomass  to  the  maximum, 
it  is  important  to  understand  the  properties  of 
biomass  fuels  and  fundamentals  of  numerous 
complex reactions associated with their oxidation 
to  carbon  dioxide  and  water.  This  can  help  in

manipulating biomass combustion for maximizing 
thermodynamic efﬁ ciency and minimizing adverse 
environmental impacts. Combustion is a process in 
which carbon and hydrogen in the fuel react with 
oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water through 
a  series  of  free  radical  reactions,  resulting  in  the 
liberation  of  useful  heat.  General  combustion 
mechanisms have been proposed, deﬁ ning various 
stages of chain reactions like initiation, propagation, 
and  termination.  Generally,  these  mechanisms 
include the following processes.
#
The  combustion  efﬁ ciency  is  mainly  determined 
by completion of combustion process and the heat 
losses  from  the  furnace  or  combustion  device. 
Flame  temperature  also  plays  an  important  role 
in  the  overall  efﬁ ciency  of  combustion  device. 
Excess air has more inﬂ uence on adiabatic ﬂ ame 
temperature than moisture content. Theoretically, 
highest 
temperature  can  be  achieved  with 
stoichiometric  air  supply  (λ  =  1),  but  in  reality, 
excess  air  is  always  supplied  to  ensure  complete 
combustion. The optimal values of lambda depend 
on furnace design, fuel type, and fuel feeding/ﬁ ring 
system  used.  The  value  of  λ  in  well-designed 
furnaces/combustion  devices  is  in  the  range  1.6–
2.5,  while  in  poorly  designed  furnaces,  the  value 
of λ reaches as high as 4–5.

Archaeological  evidence  indicates  that  mankind 
has known the use of ﬁ re for 400 000 years now. 
In the early years, ﬁ re was used to keep the caves 
warm. The use of ﬁ re for cooking started 100 000 
years  ago,  and  in  the  earlier  days,  open  ﬁ re  was 
used (mainly for cooking/roasting meat), with fuel 
arranged in pyramid shape. The beneﬁ ts of ﬁ re in 
preserving  food,  protecting  against  large  animals 
and  rodents,  and  providing  warmth  outweighed 
the  drawbacks  of  improper  control  on  ﬁ re  and 
smoky  conditions. A  major  development  in  open 
ﬁ re was the evolution of vessels of different shapes, 
followed  by  the  development  of  shielded  three-
stone  stove  for  holding  the  pot  ﬁ rmly  over  the 
open ﬁ re. Subsequently, shielded ﬁ re was changed 
to a U-shaped mud or mud/stone stove, with front 
opening for feeding fuel and entry of combustion

Classification of biomass stoves 
Stoves  that  burn  biomass  such  as  ﬁ rewood  and 
agro-residues are called biomass stoves. These are 
used at both domestic as well as institutional levels 
for cooking, heating, and space heating purposes. 
  Stoves  burning  biomass  can  be  classiﬁ ed  in 
several  different  ways,  based  on  their  attributes, 
functions,  material,  fuel  types,  and  so  on  (FAO 
1993). Stoves can be classiﬁ ed as follows.

local biomass are the two important social factors 
that need to be taken into account while designing 
a  stove.  User  needs  include  various  cooking 
operations such as boiling, frying, baking, grilling, 
steaming, pressure cooking, and so on, which are 
needed to be performed using a stove. Apart from 
this, it is also important to know cooking time and 
process heat requirement, which would determine 
power range for the stove. Availability of the local 
construction material, desired portability, seasonal 
availability of local biomass, and so on also need 
to  be  considered  while  designing  a  stove  for  the 
target group under consideration. 
Fuel  type:  woody  biomass,  powdery  biomass, 
briquettes, cow dung, and so on.
Function:  monofunction  or  multifunction 
stoves
Construction  material:  metal,  clay,  ceramic, 
brick, and so on. 
Portability: portable (metallic, ceramic) or ﬁ xed

Number  of  pots:  single,  two  pots,  three  pots, 
and so on.

Technical factors 
A  high-performance  stove  should  be  efﬁ cient 
and  low  in  emission. A  fuel-efﬁ cient  stove  would 
reduce  the  drudgery  of  users  in  fuel  collection, 
while improvement in emissions would save users 
from  harmful  impacts  due  to  smoke  exposure.

adopted in designing improved stove is improving 
energy  efﬁ ciency  (by  enhancing  heat  transfer) 
and providing chimney for the removal of smoke. 
Though  this  strategy  improves  the  fuel  efﬁ ciency 
and  also  indoor  air  quality,  the  overall  emission 
reduction 
is  questionable.  Therefore,  besides 
improving the heat transfer efﬁ ciency, it is necessary 
to  ensure  improvement  in  combustion  efﬁ ciency, 
whereby emission of unburned harmful pollutants 
can  be  minimized.  Complete  combustion  can  be 
ensured by adopting the following steps.

Composition  of  biomass  in  terms  of  C–H–O 
content,  ash,  and  moisture-free  nature  is  quite 
similar (as mentioned earlier), but other parameters 
such as moisture content and volatile fraction have 
profound effect on its combustion characteristics. 
Besides,  there  are  a  number  of  other  process 
factors that need to be considered while designing 
a stove for maximizing efﬁ ciency and minimizing 
emissions. The effects of these process factors are 
not  easily  quantiﬁ able. Table  1  summarizes  their 
qualitative effect.
  The overall thermal efﬁ ciency (η
o) of a stove is 
deﬁ ned as the ratio of the amount of useful heat 
absorbed for cooking food to the amount of energy 
content  in  the  fuel  used.  It  is  a  combination  of 
partial  efﬁ ciencies  such  as  combustion  efﬁ ciency

into  heat  through  its  combustion),  heat  transfer

monoxide  (CO),  total  suspended  particulates 
(TSP),  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAH), 
and  formaldehyde.  Several  design  and  operating 
parameters result in incomplete combustion, thus 
contributing to these emissions. These parameters 
include insufﬁ cient supply of combustion air, lower 
temperatures in combustion zone, improper mixing 
of air and fuel, and so on. Many a times, some design 
modiﬁ cations to improve thermal performance or 
efﬁ ciency, such as reducing gap between the pan 
and  the  stove  mouth  as  well  as  between  the  pan 
and the grate, may prove detrimental, resulting in 
increased emissions. Therefore, there is a need to 
take  into  consideration  the  effect  of  any  design 
modiﬁ cation  on  stove  as  a  whole.  Generally, 
with  increasing  power  levels,  emissions  from  the 
stove  are  observed  to  increase.  Similarly,  higher

reactions  to  produce  volatile  matter  and  provide 
heat  energy  necessary  for  further  endothermic 
reduction reactions to produce producer gas, which 
mainly consists of a mixture of combustible gases 
such  as  CO,  hydrogen,  traces  of  methane,  and 
other  hydrocarbons.  Normally,  the  air  is  used  as 
a gasifying agent; however, the use of oxygen can 
produce rich, higher caloriﬁ c value gas, but due to 
cost implications, it is not usually preferred. 
emissions are observed with smaller stoves. Many 
a times, this is due to the lower residence time of 
the fuel in the combustion chamber of the stove, 
resulting  in  incomplete  combustion  and,  hence, 
higher emissions.
BIOMASS GASIFICATION 
Thermochemical biomass gasiﬁ cation is a process 
in  which  solid  biomass  fuel  is  converted  into 
gaseous  combustible  form  (called  producer  gas) 
by  means  of  partial  oxidation.  The  reaction  is 
carried  out  at  elevated  temperatures  in  a  reactor 
called  gasiﬁ er.  Application  of  gasiﬁ ers  assumed 
signiﬁ cant 
importance  during  World  War  II 
due  to  the  scarcity  of  petroleum  products.  By 
the  end  of  the  World  War  in  1942,  more  than 
million  vehicles  using  gasiﬁ ers  were  in  operation 
throughout  the  world.  However,  after  the  end  of 
the  War,  they  were  largely  decommissioned,  as 
petroleum  products  once  again  became  widely 
available  at  cheap  rates. The  energy  crisis  in  the 
1970s  generated  renewed  interest  in  gasiﬁ cation. 
The  technology  was  perceived  as  a  relatively 
cheaper  option  in  developing  countries  having 
sufﬁ cient  sustainable  biomass  for  small-scale 
industrial as well as power generation applications. 
Gasiﬁ cation of biomass looks simple in principle, 
and many types of gasiﬁ ers have been developed. 
Production  of  gaseous  fuel  from  solid  fuel  offers 
easy  handling,  better  control  on  combustion, 
and possibility of using it in internal combustion 
engine  for  shaft  power  or  electricity  production, 
which makes gasiﬁ cation very appealing, especially 
for small decentralized options. However, biomass 
fuel  used  in  gasiﬁ er  varies  widely  in  its  physical 
and  chemical  properties,  and  makes  the  gasiﬁ er 
reactions complicated to design.
Gasification reactions 
A complete understanding of the various complex 
reactions  occurring  in  a  gasiﬁ er  has  not  been 
possible  so  far.  However,  the  following  reactions 
explain the process of gasiﬁ cation fairly well. 
C+O2 —> CO2+393 800 kJ/kg mole  
(combustion)
C+H2O —> CO+H2 – 131 400 kJ/kg mole 
 
(water gas) 
 
C+CO2 —> 2CO – 172 600 kJ/kg mole 
(Boudouard reaction)
 
CO+H2O —> CO2+H2+41 200 kJ/kg mole 
(water shift reaction)
 
C+2H2 —> CH4+75 000 kJ/kg mole 
(methane reaction)
 
With the help of the above reaction scheme, and 
with the knowledge of the equilibrium constants, it 
is possible to predict the equilibrium composition of 
the gaseous products. The equilibrium composition 
of  a  given  solid  fuel  depends  on  the  air  supply 
per  unit  weight  of  the  biomass.  A  dimensionless 
parameter,  known  as  the  equivalence  ratio  (ER), 
is applied to characterize the air supply conditions, 
and is usually deﬁ ned as follows.
  Weight of the actual oxygen supplied/Weight of 
the theoretical oxygen required
  The  denominator  in  the  above  equation  is  the 
oxygen  required  for  the  complete  combustion 
of  the  fuel,  and  it  varies  from  fuel  to  fuel.  It  is 
generally  observed  that  for  effective  gasiﬁ cation, 
the ER should be in the range of 0.2–0.4. Below 
the  ER  value  of  0.2,  pyrolysis  dominates  the 
process and above the ER value of 0.4, combustion 
predominates. 
Principle of gasification 
Biomass  gasiﬁ cation  is  a  process  of  converting 
solid  biomass  fuel  into  gaseous  combustible  gas 
(called  producer  gas)  through  a  sequence  of 
complex  thermochemical  reactions.  In  the  ﬁ rst 
stage,  partial  combustion  of  biomass  to  produce 
gas  and  char  occurs  along  with  the  generation 
of  heat.  This  heat  is  utilized  in  drying  biomass 
to  evaporate  its  moisture  as  well  as  for  pyrolysis 
In  a  real  gasiﬁ er,  however,  the  composition  of 
the gas does not reach the equilibrium value and is

of higher moisture content in the gas, more air is 
required to combust biomass required to generate 
heat  for  drying/heating  of  the  biomass  as  well  as 
for  achieving  endothermic  gasiﬁ cation  reactions. 
As  a  result,  with  higher  moisture  content  in  the 
biomass,  the  carbon  dioxide  fraction  in  the  gas 
increases and CO fraction reduces. It also becomes 
difﬁ cult to maintain high fuel bed temperature, as 
the  biomass  has  very  high  moisture  content. The 
percentage of hydrogen in the gas increases slightly 
initially  till  the  biomass  has  about  20%  moisture 
content, but then again it starts decreasing.
generally dependent on the gasiﬁ er design. Factors 
affecting  the  gas  composition  are  temperature 
distribution in the fuel bed, average gas residence 
time,  and  the  residence  time  distribution. These 
are, in turn, dependent on the mode of air entry, 
dimensions  of  the  gasiﬁ er,  and  the  quantum  of 
heat  loss  to  the  surroundings. The  modelling  of 
the  various  processes  occurring  in  the  gasiﬁ er 
requires  not  only  the  knowledge  of  kinetics  but 
also an understanding of the heat and mass transfer 
processes occurring in various zones of the gasiﬁ er. 
A brief description of some important factors that 
affect  the  quality  of  producer  gas  generation  in 
gasiﬁ er is given subsequently.
Residence time 
Often,  the  effect  of  residence  time  is  overlooked 
while  designing  a  gasiﬁ er.  In  order  to  generate 
good  quality  gas  at  various  rates  of  fuel  burning 
(or  rates  of  producing  gas),  there  is  a  need  to 
ensure  sufﬁ cient  time  for  the  completion  of 
gasiﬁ er  reactions  within  the  reactor  zone.  This 
helps  in  achieving  tar  cracking  under  reducing 
environment in the high temperature zone in the 
presence of char, resulting in reduced components 
for tar cracking. Cleaning in this system may work 
out  to  be  a  costly  affair,  especially  for  smaller 
systems. 
Fuel size 
Fuel size affects fuel movement within biomass as 
well  as  the  rate  of  reactions  and  energy  intensity 
per unit volume. Large wood pieces provide smaller 
surface area per unit volume of reactor, which, in 
turn, affects the quality of gas, as volatilization or 
pyrolysis  becomes  less  intense.  Very  small-sized 
biomass  leads  to  intense  volatilization  process, 
leading  to  the  formation  of  signiﬁ cant  pyrolytic 
liquid, which is not desirable in gasiﬁ cation, though 
it might be desired otherwise for obtaining liquid 
fuel.  Larger  fuel  size  also  leads  to  fuel  bridging, 
which hampers the smooth fuel movement within 
gasiﬁ er reactor. Smaller fuel size results in higher 
pressure  drop  across  the  fuel  bed  in  the  reactor. 
Therefore, normally, fuel of the size one-fourth or 
one-ﬁ fth of the smallest dimension of the reactor 
cross-section  is  preferred  to  avoid  fuel  bridging. 
If pulverized fuel is used in the ﬁ xed bed gasiﬁ er, 
the  fuel  movement  becomes  non-uniform  and 
takes  place  in  an  uneven  manner,  and  many  a 
times, tunnelled gas pathways are generated in the 
fuel  bed,  causing  tar  carryover  without  cracking, 
resulting in high tar content in raw gas. 
Ash content and its nature 
Materials  with  high  ash  content  are  difﬁ cult  to 
handle, as they can lead to the problem of clinker 
formation in the fuel bed, especially if ash has low 
fusion point. Also, the presence of several inorganic 
matters  such  as  mud,  sand,  and  grit  is  not  quite 
unusual in agro-based biomass. This may not pose 
any  problem  in  combustion  devices/furnaces  but 
can block the entire reactor operation due to ash 
fusion  taking  place  inside  the  reactor  at  higher 
temperatures,  which  hampers  the  fuel  movement 
and gasiﬁ cation process.
Gasifier reactor types 
The  various  types  of  reactors  used  for  biomass 
gasiﬁ cation  can  be  classiﬁ ed  in  different  ways, 
of  which  density  factor  (ratio  of  dense  biomass 
phase  to  total  reactor  volume)  is  a  simple  and 
effective  way  of  classiﬁ cation. Thus,  gasiﬁ ers  can 
be classiﬁ ed as follows.
Fuel moisture content 
With  higher  moisture  content,  the  net  caloriﬁ c 
value  of  fuel  decreases  and  so  does  the  caloriﬁ c 
value of the producer gas generated, thereby leading 
to  a  reduction  in  gasiﬁ cation  efﬁ ciency. Also,  the 
tar fraction in the producer gas increases with an 
increase  in  the  moisture  in  the  biomass.  Because

furnaces,  as  it  gives  higher  operating  thermal 
efﬁ ciencies. If the gas is to be used for electricity 
generation by internal combustion (IC) engines, it 
has to be cleaned thoroughly. 
#
#
In dense phase reactors, such as ﬁ xed bed reactors 
(updraft,  downdraft,  cross  draft,  and  so  on), 
biomass  or  feedstock  occupies  maximum  reactor 
volume,  with  typical  density  factors  of  about 
0.3–0.8.  On  the  contrary,  in  lean  phase  reactors, 
such  as  ﬂ uidized  bed  reactors,  biomass  occupies 
very  little  reactor  volume,  that  is,  of  the  order  of 
0.05–0.2.  Dense  phase  reactors  can  be  classiﬁ ed 
as follows.
In  most  updraft  gasiﬁ ers,  steam  is  injected  or 
evaporated  into  the  hot  partial  combustion  zone, 
which  has  a  beneﬁ cial  effect  on  the  gas  quality 
and also prevents the lower portion of the gasiﬁ er 
from  overheating.  Generally,  the  sensible  heat  of 
the  producer  gas  or  the  radiative  heat  from  the 
gasiﬁ er  shell  is  used  for  generating  the  necessary 
amount of steam. 
  The characteristics of an updraft gasiﬁ er are as 
follows.
#
 
Updraft, or countercurrent gasifier
In a countercurrent moving bed reactor, also called 
as updraft gasiﬁ er, the air ﬂ ows in countercurrent 
to downward fuel ﬂ ow and enters into the gasiﬁ er 
from  below  the  grate  and  ﬂ ows  in  the  upward 
direction  within  the  gasiﬁ er. The  updraft  gasiﬁ er 
has deﬁ ned distinct zones for partial combustion, 
reduction,  and  distillation  (Figure  4A). The  gas 
produced in the reduction zone leaves the gasiﬁ er 
reactor,  along  with  the  pyrolysis  products  and 
the  steam  from  the  drying  zone.  The  resulting 
combustible producer gas is rich in hydrocarbons 
(tars) and, therefore, has relatively higher caloriﬁ c 
value. Therefore,  it  is  more  suitable  for  thermal 
applications  such  as  direct  heating  in  industrial 
for  various 
It  has  clearly  deﬁ ned  zones 
reactions. 
Its  efﬁ ciency  is  high  because  hot  gases  pass 
through  entire  fuel  bed  and  leave  at  lower 
temperatures. The  sensible  heat  of  the  hot  gas 
is  used  for  reduction,  pyrolysis,  and  drying 
processes.
Products from pyrolysis and drying, containing 
water vapour, tar, and volatiles, leave the gasiﬁ er 
without  passing  through  high  temperature 
zones and, therefore, do not get cracked. Hence, 
elaborate gas cleaning is required before using 
it, making it less suitable for engine operation.
It is unsuitable for high volatile fuels.
#
#
#
Downdraft, or co-current gasifier 
In a co-current moving bed reactor, or a downdraft 
gasiﬁ er,  the  air  enters  at  the  middle  level  of  the 
gasiﬁ er, above the grate, and the resulting mixture 
of air and gas ﬂ ows down cocurrently through the 
gasiﬁ er reactor (Figure 4B). All the decomposition 
products from the pyrolysis and drying zones are 
forced  to  pass  through  an  oxidation  zone.  This 
leads  to  the  thermal  cracking  of  the  volatiles, 
resulting  in  reduced  tar  content  in  the  producer 
gas. For this reason, this gas is preferred for engine 
applications. There is always a constriction at the 
level  of  the  oxidation  zone  to  force  the  pyrolysis 
products through a concentrated high temperature 
zone  to  achieve  complete  decomposition.  This 
concentrated oxidation zone can cause sintering or 
slagging of ash, resulting in clinker formation and 
consequent blocking of the constricted area and/or

This  gasiﬁ er  is  not  suitable  for  high  ash,  high 
moisture,  and  low  ash  fusion  temperature 
fuels.
#
Cross-draft gasifier 
In  a  cross-draft  gasiﬁ er,  the  air  enters  from  one 
side of the gasiﬁ er reactor, and gas leaves from the 
other  side  (Figure  4C). A  cross-draft  gasiﬁ er  has 
very  few  applications  and  can  hardly  be  credited 
with any advantage besides a good permeability of 
the bed. The characteristics of this type of gasiﬁ er 
are given below.

channel formation. Continuous rotating ash grates 
or  other  mechanical  shaking  may  be  required 
to  avoid  this  problem.  Compared  to  an  updraft 
gasiﬁ er, the disadvantages of a downdraft gasiﬁ er 
are higher gas outlet temperature and lower thermal 
efﬁ ciency.  Additional  steam  or  water  injection  is 
not  common  in  downdraft  gasiﬁ ers. They  can  be 
operated at very high speciﬁ c gasiﬁ cation rate – in 
the range 2900–3900 kg/h m2 – which corresponds 
to about 1 Nm3/h m2 (highest reported was 5020 
kg/h  m2). The  initial  ignition  time  required  for  a 
downdraft gasiﬁ er is lower compared to an updraft 
gasiﬁ er, which is in the range of 15–20 minutes, but 
it is still perceived longer. A downdraft gasiﬁ er has 
relatively  better  load  following  capability  (ability 
to quickly extend the partial combustion zone to 
produce higher required gas quantity).
  The  characteristics  of  a  downdraft  gasiﬁ er  are 
as follows.

Before leaving, tar-laden gases pass through the 
high  temperature  bed  of  coal  in  the  oxidation 
zone and, hence, get cracked. Thus, the output 
gases are relatively clean, requiring less elaborate 
gas cleaning system.
The gases leave at a relatively high temperature, 
about 400–500 °C; hence, the operating thermal 
efﬁ ciency of this gasiﬁ er is less than that of an 
updraft gasiﬁ er.

agricultural products, tar needs to be removed, as 
the  seed  layer  acts  like  a  granular  bed  ﬁ lter  and 
tar  gets  deposited  in  the  ﬁ rst  layer.  Similarly,  in 
some cases, tar needs to be removed in pottery or 
ceramic  industry  application  in  order  to  prevent 
any adverse effect on the product quality. 
a  particular  reactor  type,  it  varies  with  the  fuel 
used  as  well  as  operating  conditions.  Depending 
on the application, the gas needs to be cleaned and 
conditioned. There  is  always  a  possibility  of  tar 
and  vapour  condensing  along  with  dust  particles 
to form a semi-solid mixture, which blocks various 
ﬁ lters  and  gasiﬁ er  system  components  down  the 
line. In order to prevent this, the gas is cleaned and 
conditioned. However, the best strategy would be to 
obtain a clean gas, which, in turn, would reduce gas 
cleaning requirement. Normally, dust particulates 
from  the  gas  are  removed  in  hot  conditions  (tar 
and water vapour remaining in gaseous form), and 
then the gas is cooled to condense tar and water 
vapour  to  form  liquid  condensate,  which  is  then 
trapped  and  removed.  The  extent  of  treatment 
required varies, depending on gas applications.
  Generally,  no  elaborate  treatment  is  required 
for direct thermal applications of gas, as all the tar 
gets burned if burner is designed properly. Thus, 
only  dust  particulates  are  removed.  However,  if 
the  gas  is  to  be  used  directly  for  drying  seeds  or 
Producer gas utilization 
Depending  on  the  gasifying  agent,  like  air  and 
oxygen/steam, gas with low (caloriﬁ c value of 3–7 
MJ/Nm3)  or  medium  (caloriﬁ c  value  of  12–16 
MJ/Nm3)  heat  value  is  produced.  In  most  of  the 
gasiﬁ ers,  air  is  used  as  a  gasifying  agent,  and  so, 
gas  with  low  heating  value  is  produced,  which 
needs  to  be  utilized  at  the  site,  as  compressing 
and transporting it become expensive due to high 
(about 50%–55%) nitrogen content in gas.
  The  primary  objective  of  gasiﬁ cation  is  to 
convert  solid  biomass  into  a  more  convenient-
to-use gaseous form (two steps up on the energy 
ladder) called producer gas, which, in turn, can be 
used in gas burners to use biomass more efﬁ ciently

cleaning, the gas can be used for producing power 
by using IC engines. 
  Various  gas  characteristics 
(physical  and 
chemical  parameters),  along  with  velocity,  affect 
the performance of the gas in a burner. These are 
listed as below.
#
producer  gas  is  used  instead  of  natural  gas,  and 
therefore,  modiﬁ cations  in  ﬂ ue  gas  paths  might 
become  necessary  for  compensating  higher  head 
losses.  Lower  ﬂ ame  temperature  attainable  with 
producer  gas  can  have  limitations  in  its  use  (and 
so  at  higher  temperatures  like  metal  melting  of 
cement  kiln  dual  ﬁ ring  becomes  necessary)  and 
also  result  in  lower  heat  transfer  efﬁ ciencies, 
resulting in derating of burner capacity.

Gasifier stove 
The  heating  of  biomass  causes  chemical 
decomposition (‘pyrolysis’), which releases volatile 
solids  or  gases,  which  need  to  be  subsequently 
burned  in  ‘secondary  combustion’  process. This 
process  occurs  nearly  simultaneously  in  regular 
biomass  combustion  stoves/ﬁ res,  making  the  two 
stages  difﬁ cult  to  observe  or  even  control.  But  if 
these pyrolysis gases are not burned immediately, 
they  can  escape  as  products  of 
incomplete 
combustion  (PIC).  As  mentioned  earlier,  the 
PIC have more global warming potential (GWP) 
than  carbon  dioxide,  which  is  obtained  through 
complete combustion of fuel. The pyrolysis process 
is easier to understand, observe, and control. This 
process  is  informally  known  as  ‘gasiﬁ cation’.  As 
mentioned earlier, commercially viable gasiﬁ cation 
has long been understood and used in the industry 
sector  and  even  in  transportation,  but  does  not 
ﬁ nd  application  for  small  applications  such  as  a 
household stove.
  Since  1985,  Dr  T  B  Reed  worked  for  about 
a  decade  on  the  development  of  a  very  small 
gasiﬁ er  for  meeting  the  domestic  stove  needs  of 
impoverished  people.  He  worked  on  developing 
#

Variation  in  these  parameters  can  result  in  ﬂ ame 
lift-off (excessive gas velocity, resulting in its losing 
contact with the burner), internal burning of ﬂ ame 
back  (lower  gas  velocity  than  ﬂ ame  propagation, 
resulting  in  internal  burning)  or  unstable  ﬂ ame. 
Flame  back  can  be  dangerous  as  ﬂ ame  starts 
moving  upstream  in  a  premixed  gas–air  mixture 
and  can  be  prevented  by  ﬂ ame  arrester  but  can 
result  in  the  ﬂ ame  getting  extinguished.  While 
changing  the  type  of  gaseous  fuel  used  in  the 
gas  burner,  there  is  a  need  to  give  attention  to 
caloriﬁ c  value  (heating  value),  stoichiometric  air 
requirements,  and  its  effect  on  adiabatic  ﬂ ame 
temperature as well gas ﬂ ue gas volumes. Table 4 
gives  a  comparison  for  the  usage  of  low  heating 
value (LHV), medium heating value (MHV), and 
natural gas in the burner. 
It can be observed that for the generation of 1 MJ 
of energy, the producer (LHV) gas requirement is 
8.5 times higher than the natural gas requirement. 
As a result, higher ﬂ ue gases are generated when

  A  series  of  modiﬁ cations  and  improvisation

therefore,  can  be  emptied  to  save  the  resultant

or  salinity,  nutrients,  and  toxic  or  inhibitory 
substrates.  Among  all  these,  the  most  crucial 
parameter  is  temperature,  as  methanogenesis  is 
strongly  temperature  dependent,  with  reaction 
rates  generally  increasing  with  the  increase  in 
temperature.  The  most  optimum  temperature 
range for gas production is 30–35 °C (mesophilic), 
below  which  the  digestion  process  slows  down, 
with  little  gas  produced  at  a  temperature  of 
15  °C  and  less. Therefore,  in  areas  that  witness 
temperature  ﬂ uctuation,  such  as  mountainous 
regions,  temperatures  have  to  be  maintained  by 
providing heat or increasing insulation to prevent 
heat losses. The hydrogen ion concentration, or the 
pH, is another important factor, as most anaerobic 
conversion processes operate best at near neutral 
pH. Excess production and accumulation of acidic 
or  basic  conversion  products  such  as  organic 
fatty  acids  or  ammonia  lead  to  pH  ﬂ uctuations 
outside the optimal range, thereby displacing the 
bicarbonate  buffer  system  that  has  more  neutral 
pH,  thus  inhibiting  methanogenesis.  Methane 
formation is also affected by the quantity of daily 
feeding (loading rate) and the retention period of 
the  feedstock  in  a  biogas  plant. The  loading  rate 
and retention period are optimized, depending on 
the nature of the feedstock and climatic conditions. 
A  high  loading  rate  that  is  more  than  the  rated 
capacity will form excessive acids, leading to low 
rate of gas formation and production of undigested 
slurry. The retention period for most plants ranges 
between  30  days  and  55  days,  and  is  found  to 
reduce if temperatures are raised or more nutrients 
are  added  to  the  digester. The  optimum  nutrient 
requirement  is  generally  20–30  C/N  ratio.  The 
presence  of  trace  elements  like  iron,  magnesium, 
calcium,  sodium,  barium,  tungsten,  and  nickel 
activates  the  enzyme  systems  of  acetogenic  and 
methanogenic  bacteria  and  results  in  higher  gas 
production, while heavy metals like mercury, lead, 
chromium,  and  sulphites,  if  present,  are  toxic  to

Process 
The  process  of  anaerobic  digestion  is  a  three-
stage  process. The  stages  proceed  simultaneously 
and  include  the  activities  of  diverse  group  of 
microbes with speciﬁ c metabolic requirements. In 
the ﬁ rst stage of enzymatic hydrolysis, bacteria like 
Clostridium,  Ruminoccus,  and  Cellumonas  produce 
extracellular enzymes, such as cellulase, protease, 
amylase,  and 
lipase,  which  degrade  organic 
materials  like  complex  carbohydrates,  lipids,  and 
proteins present in the organic biomass into more 
simple  compounds  such  as  sugars.  During  the 
second  stage  of  acidiﬁ cation,  fermentative  acid-
producing bacteria, such as Anaerovibrio lipolytica, 
Bacteroides  amylophilus,  Bacteriodes  ruminocola, 
and so on, convert the simpliﬁ ed compounds into 
volatile fatty acids, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. 
In this process, the facultative anaerobic bacteria 
utilize  oxygen  and  carbon,  thereby  creating 
anaerobic conditions necessary for methanogenesis. 
In  the  ﬁ nal  stage,  obligate  anaerobes,  which  are 
archaebacteria and mainly include Methanosarcina 
barkeri,  Methanococus  mazei,  and  Methanothrix 
soengenii,  decompose 
low  molecular  weight 
(acetic  acid,  hydrogen,  carbon 
compounds 
dioxide)  to  form  biogas,  sometimes  also  referred 
to  as  ‘gobar’  gas.  This  gas  consists  of  methane 
and  carbon  dioxide,  along  with  some  traces  of 
other gases, notably hydrogen sulphide. The exact 
composition  will  vary  according  to  the  substrate 
used  in  the  methanogenesis  process,  but  as  an 
approximate  guide,  when  cattle  dung  is  a  major 
constituent  of  fermentation,  the  composition  of 
the resulting gas will be 55%–66% methane, 40%–
45%  carbon  dioxide,  and  a  negligible  amount  of 
hydrogen sulphide and hydrogen.

Design of biogas plant 
Biogas plants are classiﬁ ed on the basis of loading 
cycle, gas storage system, digester position and size, 
and feed material. The process can be a continuous, 
semi-continuous or batch type. In the batch type, 
the  loading  of  digester  is  done  periodically,  and 
after  a  fall  in  the  gas  production,  the  digester  is 
unloaded and recharged. This is suitable for crop 
and forest waste, agro-industrial waste, and other 
waste  that  does  not  mix  homogeneously  with 
water.  In  a  semi-continuous  digester,  feeding  is 
done once in three to four days, and the digester 
is  suitable  for  cattle  dung,  crop  residues,  forest 
waste, and so on. Continuous digesters are more 
suitable  for  regularly  and  sufﬁ ciently  available 
waste that can be mixed homogeneously, such as 
cattle dung and night soil. 
  A  typical  biogas  plant  consists  of  a  digester 
in  which  the  slurry  (dung  mixed  with  water)  is 
fermented; an inlet tank, which is used to mix the 
feed and from where it is passed into the digester; 
a  gas  holder/dome  in  which  the  generated  gas 
is  collected;  an  outlet  tank  to  remove  the  spent 
slurry;  distribution  pipeline(s)  to  take  the  gas  to 
the kitchen; and a manure pit in which the spent 
slurry is stored. Based on the gas storage system, 
there  are  two  main  digester  designs:  the  ﬂ oating 
dome  and  the  ﬁ xed  dome.  In  the  ﬂ oating  dome 
biogas plant, also known as the KVIC model, the 
biogas  is  stored  in  a  drum  that  can  be  made  of 
steel,  ferro-cement  or  ﬁ bre  glass.  Based  on  the 
quantity  of  the  gas  stored  in  it,  the  drum  moves 
up and down on a guide frame, which is ﬁ xed in 
digester walls. In the ﬁ xed dome type, the digester 
and gas storage dome are integrated with the space 
for storing usable gas between the dome and the 
digester,  and  the  most  common  design  is  the 
Deenbandhu model.
  While  the  Deenbandhu  model  is  appropriate 
and  more  suitable  for  individual  family-type 
requirements, the large-sized ﬂ oating dome KVIC 
design biogas plants have been successfully adopted 
for  cattle  dung,  night  soil,  kitchen  and  domestic 
waste, vegetable market waste, and so on (Figure 
7).  While  the  ministry  continues  to  promote 
individual  cattle  dung  based  family-type  biogas

Designs for alternative feedstock 
In  rural  areas,  it  is  a  common  practice  to  use 
cattle dung and night soil as feedstocks in biogas 
plants that meet the cooking energy requirements. 
However,  the  availability  of  cattle  dung  in  rural 
areas  is  limited,  and  the  cattle  population  is  also 
diminishing  fast.  Hence,  there  is  a  need  to  use 
alternative  feedstocks  for  meeting  the  increasing

cooking  energy  needs.  Alternative  organic  feed 
substrates  like  agriculture  residues,  oil  cakes, 
dry  and  wet  leaves,  vegetable  market  waste,  and 
kitchen  waste,  which  are  abundantly  available 
in  villages,  also  have  the  potential,  which  can  be 
tapped through appropriate technology for energy 
generation,  thus,  meeting  the  increasing  cooking 
energy demand. So, the production of biogas from 
other biomass like leafy waste, agro-residues, and 
kitchen waste garbage is an attractive option, which 
will  facilitate  extending  the  beneﬁ ts  of  biogas 
technology to a larger section of the society. It is 
estimated that the total potential of leafy biomass 
production in India is of the order of 1130 million 
tonnes  (MT)  (dry).  If  even  10%  of  this  biomass 
could be mobilized for biomass production, about 
67% of the rural families could be provided with 
biogas  for  cooking.  After  years  of  R&D  efforts, 
different designs have been developed in order to 
harness the biogas potential of such substrates. 
The  acid  reactor  is  daily  fed  with  waste  in  serial 
order  and  submerged  in  water  for  microbial 
action. The  water  is  re-sprinkled  thrice  a  day  for 
15  minutes  over  the  waste  bed.  Percolate  rich  in 
volatile fatty acid is collected from the bottom of 
the reactor after six days and is fed to the methane 
reactor. The efﬂ uent discharged from the methane 
reactor is recycled to the acid reactor for drawing 
more  acid-rich  liquor  from  the  waste. A  biphasic 
plant based on the similar principle is operational 
at  Maharashtra  Scooters  for  treating  300  kg/

In  plug  ﬂ ow  digesters,  freshly  fed  biomass 
feedstock in the slurry form undergoes about three 
to  ﬁ ve  days  of  rapid  decomposition  while  being 
submerged under the digester liquid. This removes 
the  problematic  volatile  fatty  acid  producing 
this  phase,  methanogens 
constituents.  After 
adequately  colonize  the  partially  decomposed 
biomass.  The  biomass  acquires  buoyancy  at 
this  stage  and  ﬂ oats  above  the  fermenter  liquid. 
The  rate  of  acidogenesis  and  methanogenesis  is 
adequately balanced, which produces biogas. Two 
plants of capacities 60 × 4 m3 and 60 × 6 m3 are 
operational  near  Kannati,  Chikkamangalur,  for 
treating  coffee  waste  water. These  are  being  run 
for  eight  months  with  leafy  biomass  and  for  the 
balance three months as biomass-supported ﬁ xed 
ﬁ lm biogas plant for treating coffee waste water.
The  conventional  biogas  KVIC  design  has  been 
modiﬁ ed  in  two  ways.  First,  by  introducing  a  5-
HP  mixer  to  process  the  waste  before  putting  it 
into  a  pre-digester  tank,  and  second,  by  using 
thermophilic  microbes  for  faster  digestion  of  the 
waste.  The  growth  of  thermophiles  in  the  pre-
digester tank is ensured by mixing the waste with 
hot water and maintaining the temperature in the 
range  of  55–60  °C  by  using  solar  heater.  From 
the  predigester  tank,  the  slurry  enters  the  main 
tank, where it undergoes anaerobic digestion. The 
undigested  ligno-cellulosic  and  hemi-cellulosic 
material  then  enters  the  settling  tank.  Manure  is 
dug  out  from  the  settling  tanks  about  a  month 
later. The  gas  generated  in  the  plant  is  used  for 
cooking in the nearby canteen/hostel and also for 
gas-based lights ﬁ tted around the plant.

sectors of the economy. However, the production 
and  use  of  fossil  fuels  for  power  generation, 
industrial  application,  and  transportation  have 
been associated with adverse local environmental 
impacts  such  as  deforestation,  land  degradation, 
and water and air pollution. In addition, there are 
concerns about the release of greenhouse (GHG) 
emission  from  the  energy  sector,  particularly 
during  power  generation  using  fossil  fuels.  One 
strategy  to  address  these  environmental  issues 
and  diversifying  sources  of  energy  supply  at  the 
same  time  is  the  development  and  promotion  of 
renewable energy technologies. 
  During  the  past  two  decades,  considerable 
efforts  have  been  made  towards 
large-scale 
penetration  of  renewable  energy  technologies  in 
India.  Grid-connected  power  generation  through 
wind  energy  in  the  country  has 
crossed the 9521 MW mark, making 
India the fourth largest wind power 
generating  country  in  the  world 
after Germany, Spain, and USA. At 
the end of 2006, worldwide capacity 
of  wind-powered  generators  was 
73.9 gigawatts, although it currently 
produces just over 1% of worldwide 
electricity use. 
farms  are  now  common  in  many 
countries, small wind machines are 
also developing their own niche in 
the renewable energy sector. 
  Typically,  small  wind  machines  of  capacity  up 
to 100 kW are called small wind machines. Small 
wind energy systems are of the following types.

of energy to the earth per hour. In other words, the 
earth  receives  1.74  ×  1017  watts  of  power. About 
1%–2%  of  the  energy  coming  from  the  sun  is 
converted into wind energy, which is about 50 to 
100  times  more  than  the  energy  converted  into 
biomass by all plants on earth. 
  Wind  is  a  form  of  solar  energy  and  is  created 
by  the  unequal  heating  of  the  earth’s  surface  by 
the  sun.  During  the  day,  the  air  above  the  land 
heats  up  more  quickly  than  the  air  over  water. 
The  warm  air  over  land  expands  and  rises,  and 
the  heavier,  cooler  air  rushes  in  to  take  its  place, 
creating  winds.  At  night,  the  winds  are  reversed 
because the air cools more rapidly over land than 
over water. In the same way, the large atmospheric 
winds that circle the earth are created because the 
land near the earth’s equator is heated more by the 
sun compared to the land near the North Pole and 
South Pole. 
  The  terms  ‘wind  energy’  and  ‘wind  power’ 
describe  the  process  by  which  the  wind  is  used 
to generate mechanical power, or electricity. Wind 
turbines  convert  the  kinetic  energy  in  the  wind 
into clean electricity. Wind power uses the kinetic 
energy  of  the  ﬂ owing  air  to  generate  mechanical 
energy in a wind turbine, which can be transformed 
into pollution-free electricity. 
  Air  moves  around  the  earth  because  of  the 
existing differences in temperature and atmospheric 
pressure.  Wind  turbines  harness  the  movement 
of  the  air  to  produce  energy. The  wind  turns  the 
blades,  which  turn  a  rotor  shaft. This  produces 
mechanical  power,  which  is  used  to  drive  an 
electric generator. When the wind spins the blades 
of  the  wind  turbine,  a  rotor  captures  the  kinetic 
energy  of  the  wind  and  converts  it  into  rotary 
motion to drive the generator. Most turbines have 
automatic  overspeed-governing  systems  to  keep 
the rotor from spinning out of control in very high 
winds.  Flow  chart  given  in  Figure  2  shows  the 
steps  of  generation  of  energy  from  wind  and  its 
distribution.

Darrieus model, named after its French inventor. 
Most  large  modern  wind  turbines  are  horizontal 
axis turbines.
Horizontal axis
Most  wind  machines  that  are  in  operation  today 
are the horizontal axis type. Horizontal axis wind 
machines  have  blades  that  resemble  airplane 
propellers.  A  typical  horizontal  wind  machine 
stands as tall as a 20-storied building and has three 
blades that span across 200 feet. 
Vertical axis
Vertical axis wind machines have blades that span 
from the top to the bottom, and the most common 
type  (Darrieus  wind  turbine)  looks  like  a  giant 
two-blade  egg  beater. This  type  of  vertical  wind 
machine is typically 100 feet tall and 50 feet wide. 
These machines are available in the capacity size 
of 650 watts to 2 MW for onshore application. For 
offshore application, 5-MW capacity wind turbine 
is commercially available. 
  Horizontal  and  vertical  axis  wind  turbines  are 
presented  in  Figure  3,  and  the  internal  structure 
of a horizontal axis turbine is given in Figure 4.
  Almost  all  wind  turbine  generators  consist  of 
rotor  blades,  which  rotate  around  a  horizontal 
hub. The  hub  is  connected  to  a  gearbox  and  a 
generator,  which  are  located  inside  a  nacelle. 
The  nacelle  houses  electrical  components  and  is 
mounted at the top of a tower.

will  depend  on  the  application.  The  balance  of 
system  required  will  also  depend  on  whether  the 
system  is  grid-connected,  stand-alone  or  part  of 
a hybrid system. For a residential grid-connected 
application,  the  balance  of  system  parts  may 
include  a  controller,  storage  batteries,  a  power-
conditioning unit (inverter), and wiring. 
Stand-alone systems
Stand-alone  systems  (systems  not  connected  to 
the  utility  grid)  require  batteries  to  store  excess 
power  generated  for  use  when  the  wind  is  calm. 
They  also  need  a  charge  controller  to  keep  the 
batteries  from  overcharging.  Small  wind  turbines 
generate  DC  (direct  current)  electricity.  In  very 
small systems, DC appliances operate directly off 
the batteries.

In  grid-connected  systems,  the  only  additional

Wind  speed  increases  with  height;  therefore, 
the  turbine  is  mounted  on  a  tower.  In  general, 
the  higher  the  tower,  the  more  power  the  wind 
system  can  produce.  The  tower  also  raises  the 
turbine above the air turbulence and obstructions 
such  as  hills,  buildings,  and  trees. A  general  rule 
of thumb is to install the wind turbine on a tower 
with the bottom of the rotor blades at least 30 feet 
(9  metres)  above  any  obstacle  that  is  within  300 
feet (90 metres) of the tower.

  Generation  of  electricity  from  wind  at  a  given 
wind speed and wind turbine type varies to a great 
degree  with  the  wind  speed  distribution  around 
the mean value. For example, on a site where 50% 
of the time wind speed Vav = 12 m/s and 50% of the 
time Vav  =  0  m/s,  a  wind  turbine  would  generate 
much more electricity than that which is on a site 
where 100% of the time wind speed Vav = 6 m/s. 
This is due to the fact that wind energy, in theory, 
is proportional to the cube of the wind speed.
  Wind resource evaluation is a critical element in 
projecting turbine performance at a given site. The 
energy available in a wind stream is proportional 
to  the  cube  of  its  speed,  which  means  that 
doubling  the  wind  speed  increases  the  available 
energy by a factor of eight. Furthermore, the wind 
resource itself is seldom a steady, consistent ﬂ ow. 
It varies with the time of day, season, height above 
ground, and type of terrain. Proper siting in windy 
locations, away from large obstructions, enhances 
a wind turbine’s performance.

Wind speed to operate a turbine
The greater the annual mean wind speed, the better 
a turbine works. In general, most small/micro wind 
turbines  start  generating  electricity  when  wind 
speeds  are  in  the  range  of  approximately  3–4  m/
s,  and  most  products  achieve  their  maximum,  or 
rated, output at a wind speed of 10–12 m/s, which 
is  crucial  when  comparing  products.  In  order  to 
measure  the  annual  wind  speed,  the  knowledge 
of  prevailing  wind  and  its  direction  are  required 
at the site. 
In  addition  to  geologic  formations,  other 
obstacles such as trees, buildings, and hills should 
also be considered. The turbine needs to be sited 
upwind of buildings and trees, and it needs to be 
30 feet above anything to reach the height of 300 
feet. 
  Any site will have different average wind speeds 
at  different  locations.  An  assessment  of  the  site 
should include taking into consideration elevated 
structures  like  hills  in  the  vicinity  of  the  turbine. 
Such sites with elevations are more suitable than 
gullies or the lee side of hills.
  A site where annual mean wind speed is 5 m/s, 
a turbine with a rating of 1 kW and a diameter of 
2.3  m  would  generate  approximately  1200  kWh, 
or  units,  of  electricity  per  year.  For  an  average 
household to meet all its electricity needs from a 
small wind turbine, a system of 2.5–6 kW would 
be needed, depending on wind speed.
 
In  general,  annual  average  wind  speed  of  5 
m/s  (11  miles  per  hour,  or  mph)  is  required  for 
grid-connected applications. Annual average wind 
speed of 3–4 m/s (7–9 mph) may be adequate for 
unconnected electrical and mechanical applications 
such as battery charging and water pumping. Wind 
resources  exceeding  this  speed  prevail  in  many 
parts of the world. 
  Wind power density is a useful way to evaluate 
the wind resource available at a potential site. The 
wind power density, measured in watts per square 
metre,  indicates  how  much  energy  is  available  at 
the  site  for  conversion  by  a  wind  turbine. Wind 
speed  generally 
increases  with  height  above 
ground. Table  1  gives  the  classes  of  wind  power 
density at 10 m and 50 m elevation.
  Another  useful  indirect  measurement  of  the 
includes  observing  an  area’s 
wind  resource 
vegetation. Trees, especially conifers or evergreens, 
can  be  permanently  deformed  by  strong  winds. 
This  deformity,  known  as  ‘ﬂ agging’,  has  been 
used  to  estimate  the  average  wind  speed  for  an 
area.  Figure  8  shows  different  level  of  ﬂ agging, 
depending on different wind speed levels.
 
Wind resource assessment
Wind resources vary with the time of day, season, 
elevation,  and  type  of  terrain.  Wind  plays  an 
important  role  in  determining  success  or  failure 
of a small wind turbine project. At the same time, 
the cost of assessing wind resources for a smaller 
project can be too high.

Windmill pumps
A windmill pump consists of a wind rotor, a pump, 
and a power transmission mechanism connecting 
the  rotor  to  the  pump. The  rotor  extracts  energy 
from the wind and converts it into useful mechanical 
shaft  power.  A  transmission  mechanism  conveys 
the energy from the rotor to the pump rod, which 
in  turn  transmits  power  to  the  pump. The  useful 
life of a well-designed windmill pump is expected 
to be 15 years or more with proper maintenance 
and care. The useful life of a windmill pump may 
get reduced due to corrosion, which predominantly

reservoir  in  the  rocks.  These  are  known  as  hot 
dry rock (HDR) systems. Another method, which 
is  under  investigation,  is  the  exploitation  of  the 
large quantities of heat stored locally at accessible 
depth in molten rock (magma). This can provide 
high  temperature  underground  water,  which 
can  provide  energy  for  many  applications. These 
applications  include  district  heating,  individual 
residential heating, and spa uses.

4 billion years ago and is continually regenerated 
from the decay of radioactive elements that occur 
in all rocks.
  From  the  surface  down  through  the  crust,  the 
normal  temperature  gradient  (the  increase  of 
temperature  with  the  increase  of  depth)  in  the 
earth’s crust is 17–30 °C per kilometre of depth. 
Below  the  crust  is  the  mantle,  which  is  made  up 
of highly viscous, partially molten rocks that have 
temperature in the range of 650–1250 °C. At the

ECO-HOUSING AND ECO-FRIENDLY BUILDING 
DESIGN
Eco-house is a house that has minimal environmental 
impact  during  its  construction  and  operation 
period. During its construction, it causes minimum 
disruption  to  surroundings. After  its  construction 
when  it  becomes  habitable,  it  consumes  very  less 
electricity. It is naturally lit and ventilated. Energy-
efﬁ cient  architecture  of  eco-house  ensures  the 
reduced consumption of electricity for cooling and 
heating. The plumbing system of eco-house uses less 
water and puts relatively fewer loads on city’s sewage 
system. This  is  designed  giving  due  consideration 
to  solid  waste  management  system,  reducing 
the  burden  on  city’s  solid  waste  disposal  system. 
Broadly, an eco-house follows six basic principles: 
site planning, energy-efﬁ cient architecture, energy-
efﬁ cient systems in the building, use of renewable 
energy, efﬁ cient water management, and solid waste 
management system.
new building. During the construction stage, there 
is  efﬁ cient  management  of  waste  water  and  solid 
waste.  Efﬁ cient  waste  management  plan  ensures 
that  the  entire  site  is  protected  from  hazardous 
construction waste.
ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY AND ENERGY-
EFFICIENT BUILDING DESIGN
All  buildings  in  eco-housing  are  designed  for 
energy efﬁ ciency. There is an efﬁ cient utilization of 
natural climatic conditions by using passive solar 
design  concepts.  These  design  concepts  include 
the following.
#
Orientation and shading  Buildings are oriented 
in such a way that there is efﬁ cient use of sunlight 
and  wind.  Interiors  of  the  properly  orientated 
buildings  are  naturally  heated  in  winters  and 
cooled in summers. 
Building layout  The building layout is designed 
in  such  a  way  that  the  rooms  have  naturally 
comfortable  environs  during  their  occupancy 
period.  For  example,  if  the  living  room  in  an 
eco-house  is  planned  to  be  used  extensively 
during afternoons in summers, then its location 
will  be  planned  in  such  a  way  that  it  receives 
sufﬁ cient natural and diffused light so that the 
environment remains cool. 
Window 
design  Efﬁ cient  window  design 
enhances lighting and ventilation in the building. 
Windows in an eco-house are sized and placed 
according  to  solar  path.  During  summers, 
only  diffused  light  comes  from  the  window, 
and  during  winters,  warm  sunlight  ﬁ lters 
through  these  windows  and  makes  interiors
#
EFFICIENT SITE PLANNING
Overall  site  planning  and  design  of  an  eco-
building  integrates  all  natural  principles.  These 
give  due  consideration  to  preservation  and 
conservation  of  natural  features  or  resources 
present  on  the  site. These  resources  may  include 
trees and vegetation, soil, water, and other natural 
characteristics  of  the  site. The  building  layout  is 
drawn  without  disturbing  trees  and  vegetation. 
Care is taken to ensure that trees are not disturbed 
by construction activities. The fertile eco-housing 
site  is  preserved  before  starting  the  construction 
process and is utilized again for landscaping of the

more  cosy. The  windows  of  an  eco-house  are 
high-performance  windows;  these  are  shaded 
well  in  order  to  protect  the  interiors  from 
the  sun  in  harsh  summers  and  from  rains  in 
monsoons. If the buildings are air-conditioned 
then  the  window  frames  of  high  performance 
windows reduce heat losses and bring down the 
loads on air-conditioners.
Energy- and resource-efﬁ cient technologies in building 
construction  An eco-house is constructed with 
efﬁ cient  building  technologies,  which  use  eco-
friendly  materials,  and  less  water  and  power 
during construction.
Low-energy  building  materials  An  eco-house 
is  constructed  with 
low  energy  materials. 
Manufacture and transport of building materials 
are  very  resource  and  energy  intensive.  Low 
energy  materials  comprise  materials  that  are 
locally  available  and  require  less  energy  and 
resources during the construction process. The 
materials  that  are  made  from  waste  or  are  the 
by-products  of  some  other  industry  are  also 
considered as low energy building materials. 
consumption,  and  there  is  efﬁ cient  utilization  of 
water for various applications in buildings. Emphasis 
is laid on two aspects, that is, water conservation 
and  water  efﬁ ciency.  Water  conservation  means 
the  preservation  and  efﬁ cient  management  of 
water. This  includes  use  of  ﬁ xtures  that  lead  to 
conservation  of  water.  Water  efﬁ ciency  includes 
prevention  of  wastage,  overuse,  and  exploitation 
of the available resource.

management in the building. Solid waste generated 
from  households  generally  reaches  the  city 
dumping  sites. There  is  no  resource  recovery  in 
most of the cases. In general, the household waste 
generated  constitutes  various  materials  such  as 
plastics, paper, and glass that can be recycled and 
reused. In addition, the waste has a high organic 
content,  which  can  be  used  to  recover  useful 
resources such as energy and manure. Solid waste 
management in a building would also ensure safe 
and environment-friendly disposal of waste.

USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE BUILDING
All  buildings  in  eco-housing  are  fully  or  partly 
powered by renewable sources of energy. Examples 
are using solar energy for water heating and space 
heating,  biogas  for  cooking,  and  other  renewable 
energies wherever applicable.
USE OF EFFICIENT SYSTEMS IN THE BUILDING
The lighting, cooling, heating, and air-conditioning 
systems  are  efﬁ ciently  designed  in  the  eco-
housing.  High  performance,  energy-efﬁ cient,  and 
energy-labelled  products  are  commonly  used  in 
buildings. These appliances are based on the use of 
energy-efﬁ cient  technologies  and  appliances,  and 
automatic control systems. Use of such equipment 
reduces energy consumption in the building. For 
example,  heat  pumps  are  used  for  space  heating 
and cooling, insulation is used in walls and roofs 
for reducing heat loss, and so on.
National-level  awareness  programmes  and 
capacity-building  programmes  for  common 
citizens and architects need to be developed.
Agencies like the Standards and Quality Control 
Authority  (SQCA),  National  Housing  Board, 
Association  of  Construction  Contractors, 
National  environment  Commission,  Ministry 
of  Works  and  Human  Settlement,  Urban 
Development Department, and so on can work

THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 
The  Department  of  Energy  (DoE)  is  a  central 
government agency responsible for the formulation 
of  policies,  plans,  programmes,  and  guidelines 
related  to  the  energy  sector.  Formed  in  2002,  it 
deals with all forms of energy, including hydropower 
and  alternative  forms  of  energy.  It  also  provides 
technical  advice  to  the  Royal  Government  of 
Bhutan on all aspects related to energy, including 
formulating development strategy, monitoring and 
evaluating  implementation  plans,  and  preparing 
and  maintaining  programmes  and  schedules.  It 
is  also  responsible  for  giving  techno-economic 
and  budgetary  clearances  to  major  projects  and 
programmes related to energy.
  The  responsibilities  of  the  DoE  are  increasing 
over  the  period.  It  is  assumed  that  it  will 
play  increasingly  important  role  in  the  overall 
development  of  the  energy  sector.  Therefore, 
there  is  a  need  to  strengthen  and  reorganize  the 
DoE. The responsibilities of the DoE are likely to 
expand and include activities that can be classiﬁ ed/
categorized  under  various  divisions,  as  discussed 
subsequently.
  The  DoE  has  four  divisions—the  Planning 
and  Coordination  Division  (PCD),  Hydro-Met 
Services  Division  (HMSD),  and  Renewable 
Energy Division (RED). Additionally, the Bhutan 
Electricity  Authority  (BEA)  is  also  under  the

are being studied), development of improved cook 
stoves and bukharis in collaboration with Austrian 
Development  Agency,  rehabilitation  of  solar 
photovoltaic  systems,  development  of  servicing 
and training network, and so on. The division has 
also  worked  on  developing  the  draft  renewable 
energy policy. 
Planning and coordination
The activities of the meteorological and hydrological 
services  department  can  be  classiﬁ ed  into  three 
categories.

MODELS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THEIR 
USEFULNESS AND LIMITATIONS WITH RESPECT 
TO BHUTAN
Various  ﬁ nancial  and  business  models,  which 
are  successfully  used  in  market-based  country 
situation for delivering solar photovoltaic systems 
are as follows.
RED  can  be  renamed  and  restructured  as 
Sustainable Energy Division.
METEOROLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL SERVICES
Analysis  of  hydrology  data  and  preparation  of 
long-term data archives.
Maintaining  meteorological  data  in  scientiﬁ c 
and internationally approved formats.
Direct Cash Sales Model

The  consumer  buys  the  renewable  energy 
system  by  either  paying  cash  or  by  arranging 
the dealer credit.

Concession Model
The end-user immediately becomes the owner 
of the system.
#
Structurally  identical  to  the  Fee-for-Service 
Model,  with  the  only  difference  being  the 
concession availed to serve speciﬁ ed region with 
some degree of monopoly.
Concessionaire  and  regulatory-type  model 
approach to rural electriﬁ cation is being tested 
in many countries and maybe more suitable for 
rural off-grid electriﬁ cation.
#
Credit Sales Model
The model involves a specialist ﬁ nance partner, 
along  with  a  maintenance  contract  during  the 
ﬁ nance term.
End-user acquires the renewable energy system 
on  credit.  Credit  sales  are  divided  into  three 
categories. 
#
#

Rural Energy Service Concession Model
Bhutan  has  developed  Rural  Energy  Service 
Concession  Model  (RESCOM),  which 
is  a 
combination  of  Fee-for-Service  Model  and 
Concession Model. 
  With  this  approach,  consumer  would  not  be 
required  to  make  his  own  payment,  and  quality 
of services is systematically assured. This modiﬁ ed 
model also enables the development of market for 
renewable energy technologies by creating a critical 
mass essential for making commercially sustainable 
business.  Rural  energy  service  provider  operator 
will  be  selected  through  bidding  for  it  to  have 
concessional exclusive rights, being technically and 
ﬁ nancially qualiﬁ ed service provider for a speciﬁ c 
region for a speciﬁ c period of time. 
  By  effective  application  of  RESCOM,  Bhutan 
is  planning  off-grid  electriﬁ cation  of  4000-8000 
households by 2013. 
  1  Dealer  Credit  Model    On  receiving  all  the 
payments  for  an  renewable  energy  system 
through  credit  arrangements,  renewable 
energy  dealer/  supplier  sells  renewable 
energy  system/s  to  end-user  and  the  end-
user immediately becomes the owner of the 
system. 
  2  End-user Credit Model  After providing third 
party  consumer  credits  to  the  end-user, 
renewable  energy  dealer/supplier  sells  the 
renewable  energy  system  to  the  end-user. 
Usually,  the  end-user  becomes  the  owner 
of  the  system  immediately,  but  this  can  be 
delayed  until  all  the  payments  are  made. 
The  renewable  energy  system  is  used  as  a 
collateral against the loan.
  3  Lease/Hire  Purchase  Model 
  The  solar 
photovoltaic    supplier/dealer  or  a  ﬁ nancial 
intermediary leases the photovoltaic system/s 
to an end-user. At the end of the lease period, 
ownership may or may not be transferred to 
the  end-user,  depending  on  the  agreement. 
During  the  lease  period,  the  leaser  remains 
the  owner  of  the  system  and  is  responsible 
for its maintenance and repair. 
Getana Model
The Getana Model has been implemented by the 
Department  of  Energy  (DoE)  with  the  purpose 
of demonstrating a scheme for community-based 
solar photovoltaic energy services. Figure 1 shows 
the  framework  and  other  details  of  the  Getana 
Model.
Fee-for-Service Model
A large-scale ‘utility–type’ approach that usually 
involves providing subsidies to users.
An  energy  service  company  (ESCO)  owns  the 
system and provides energy service to end-user, 
who pays a periodic fee (for example, monthly) 
to ESCO.
The  end-user 
is  not  responsible  for  the 
maintenance of the system and never becomes 
the owner.

HYDROPOWER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
The  recently  released  Intergovernmental  Panel 
on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  assessment  reports 
have  established  the  phenomenon  of  global 
warming  beyond  any  doubt. The  climate  change 
may  bring  about  a  tremendous  impact  on  the 
high mountainous glacial environment like that in 
Bhutan.  Many  of  the  big  glaciers  melt  and  form 
glacial  lakes. The  global  warming  induces  faster

rate of ice and snow melting, leading to a rapid level 
rise in these lakes. The sudden discharge of large 
volumes of water and debris from the glacial lakes 
–  known  as  glacial  lake  outburst  ﬂ ood  (GLOF) 
–  could  cause  ﬂ ooding  downstream. The  GLOF 
can severely damage hydropower plants. This had 
happened  in  Nepal  in  1985  when  the  Dig Tsho 
GLOF  destroyed  the  Namche  small  hydropower 
project. 
THE ‘DUTCH DISEASE’
As  detailed  elsewhere  in  this  report,  the  export 
of  hydropower  is  the  mainstay  of  the  Bhutanese 
economy.  In  a  classic  economic  parlance,  such 
a  situation  might  lead  to  ‘Dutch  disease’.  A 
natural  resource-based  export  boom  can  cause 
major distortions in an economy by discouraging 
production  and  investment  in  the  non-booming 
exportables  sector,  often  referred  to  as  ‘Dutch 
disease’.1  However,  the  studies  show  that  there 
is  no  evidence  of  a  stagnation  of  the  non-power 
tradable sector so far. 
  Nonetheless,  it  would  be  prudent  to  take  the 
necessary  preventive  measures.  Given  the  fact 
that  Bhutan  is  blessed  with  so  many  natural 
resources that can be utilized both for value-added 
It is recommended, therefore, to set up ‘Glacial 
Lake  Outburst  Flood  Monitoring  and  Early 
Warning  System’  to  continuously  monitor  the 
likely  GLOF  hazards  and  take  early  preventive 
actions. Towards this end, Bhutan may work with 
the  United  Nations  Environment  Programme 
(UNEP);  the  International  Center  for  Integrated 
(ICIMOD),  Nepal; 
Mountain  Development 
National Remote Sensing Agency, India; and Asian 
Institute  of Technology,  Bangkok.  Such  a  system

ENERGY AND MDGS
The  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs) 
reﬂ ect an international undertaking to signiﬁ cantly 
improve  the  condition  of  the  world’s  poorest  by 
2015.
  MDGs were drawn from the actions and targets 
present  in  the  Millennium  Declaration  that  was 
adopted by 189 nations during the UN Millennium 
Summit held in September 2000. 
  Eight MDGs and their 18 quantiﬁ able targets, 
along with their 48 trackable indicators that were 
adopted  by  the  UN,  can  also  be  compared  with 
the targets and goals set by the Royal Government 
of Bhutan (RGoB). Table 1 gives a glimpse of the 
goals and targets of the MDGs. 
  Four main pillars of Gross National Happiness 
(GNH)  have  been  elaborated  to  guide  public 
products and for power generation, the focus may 
be  concentrated  on  such  decentralized  cottage 
industries.  Therefore,  there  is  a  need  to  shift 
focus  from  large,  power-intensive  industries  to 
small, village-level industries. Such industries can 
be established around decentralized power plants 
based on small hydro, biomass, and solar energy. 
Such an approach would also help in minimizing 
the migration of the rural populace to cities.
  Besides, taking advantage of cheap and abundant 
electricity,  clean  environment,  and  the  educated 
youth,  Bhutan  may  establish  itself  as  a  hub  for 
service-oriented  exports  (for  example,  software, 
business,  and  knowledge  process  outsourcing). 
This may fetch much more revenue than the plain 
exports  of  electricity.  Needless  to  say,  this  would 
also result in the creation of job opportunities for 
the local youth.
