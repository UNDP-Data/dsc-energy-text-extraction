Date Written: September 30, 2018 Abstract Access to clean cooking energy in
India has gathered a new momentum in the political discourse of India, thanks to
the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, a scheme that aims to improve access to
liquified petroleum gas (LPG) for the socio-economically weaker sections of
society. While the scheme has been successful in providing LPG connections to
over 54 million households, the real challenge is to sustain the use of clean
cooking energy and transition households away from the traditional use of
biomass. To achieve this transition, it is necessary to develop a roadmap for
clean cooking energy access that adopts a multi-fuel, multi-stakeholder
approach, and is guided by principles of equity and inclusivity. This essay
outlines sectoral and fuel-specific strategies that such a roadmap should adopt.
These strategies integrate technology and business model development and improve
access to credit for both households and enterprises. Ensuring that these
strategies are holistically implemented will require multiple ministries to come
together to plug the gaps in the value chain of each fuel, and a monitoring
framework to measure sustained use. The narrative must evolve towards the
provision of affordable, accessible, safe and convenient use of clean cooking
energy in a sustained manner.  Keywords:  clean cooking, energy access,
sustainable energy, LPG, Ujjwala scheme Suggested Citation: Suggested Citation
