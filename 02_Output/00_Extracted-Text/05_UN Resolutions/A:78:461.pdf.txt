Noting  that  the  Secretary-General  expressed  grave  concern  at  the  lack
of  any  acknowledgement  on  the  part  of  the  Government  of  Israel  of
its  responsibilities  vis-à-vis reparations and compensation to the Government
and people of Lebanon and  the Syrian Arab Republic affected by the oil spill,
Recalling that, in paragraph 5 of its resolution 77/157, it reiterated its
request to  the  Government  of  Israel  to  assume  responsibility  for  prompt
and  adequate  compensation to the Government of Lebanon and other countries
directly affected by  the  oil  slick,  such  as  the  Syrian Arab  Republic,
whose  shores  have  been  partially  polluted, and recognizing the conclusion
of the Secretary-General that this request of  the General Assembly has yet to
be implemented,     Acknowledging  that  the  Secretary-General  concluded  that
this  oil  spill  is  not  covered  by  any  of  the  international  oil  spill
compensation  funds  and  thus  merits  special consideration, and recognizing
that further consideration needs to be given to  the option of securing the
relevant compensation from the Government of Israel,      Acknowledging  also

of the report of the Secretary-General;     2.  Reiterates, for the eighteenth
consecutive year, its deep concern about the  adverse implications of the
destruction by the Israeli Air Force of the oil storage tanks  in the direct
vicinity of the Lebanese Jiyah electric power plant for the achievement  of
sustainable development in Lebanon;     3.  Considers that the oil slick has
heavily polluted the shores of Lebanon and  partially  polluted  Syrian  shores
and  consequently  has  had  serious  implicat ions  for  livelihoods  and  the
economy  of  Lebanon,  owing  to  the  adverse  implications  for  natural
resources,  biodiversity,  fisheries  and  tourism,  and  for  human  health  in
the  country;     4.  Acknowledges  the  conclusions  in  the  report  of  the
Secretary-General,  in  which he stated that studies show that the value of the
damage to Lebanon amounted  to 856.4 million United States dollars in 2014, and
requests the Secretary-General to  urge United Nations bodies and agencies and
other relevant organizations involved in  the  initial  assessment  of  the
relevant  environmental  damage  to  undertake,  within  existing resources, a
further study, building on, inter alia, the initial work of the World  Bank
presented  in  the  report  of  the  Secretary-General  submitted  to  the

the  environmental damage sustained by neighbouring countries;    5.  Reiterates
its request in this regard to the Government of Israel to assume  responsibility
for prompt and adequate compensation to the Government of Lebanon  for the
aforementioned damage and to other countries directly affected by the oil slick,
such as the Syrian Arab Republic, whose shores have been partially polluted, for
the  costs of repairing the environmental damage caused by the destruction,
including the  restoration  of  the  marine  environment,  in  particular  in
the  light  of  the  conclusion  contained in the report of the Secretary-
General that there remains grave concern at  the lack of implementation of the
relevant provisions of the resolutions of the General  Assembly on the subject
vis-à-vis reparations and compensation to the Government  and people of Lebanon
and the Syrian Arab Republic affected by the oil spill;      6.  Reiterates its
appreciation for the efforts  of the Government of Lebanon  and  those  of
Member  States,  regional  and  international  organizations,  regional  and
international  financial  institutions,  non-governmental  organizations  and
the  private  sector in the initiation of clean-up and rehabilitation operations
on the polluted shores,  and  encourages  Member  States  and  the  above-

terms, data and information rel ating to  agrifood  systems,  including
meteorology,  big  data,  the  Internet  of  things,  satellite  imagery, early
warning systems and other data-based technologies, that could help to  build the
resilience  of  smallholder  and family farmers, optimize yields  and  support
rural livelihoods;    16.  Recognizes  that  weather  forecasting  and  climate
services  and  products  allow  farmers  to  better  plan  agricultural
activities,  optimize  production,  manage  climate-related risks and integrate
climate change adaptation into t heir decisions, and  therefore  encourages
governments  and  meteorological  agencies  to  improve  the  collection,
dissemination and analysis of agrometeorological and agroclimatological  data
and information;    17.  Also recognizes that advanced technologies, such as big
data, the Internet  of  things,  artificial  intelligence  and  machine
learning,  distributed  ledgers,  remote  sensing  and  geospatial  analysis,
have  to  increase  agricultural  productivity, improve access to markets and
efficiency of inputs, and ensure timely  communication for informed decision-
making, while acknowledging that this should  be examined carefully to maximize
benefits and minimize downsides;     the  potential  18.  Further  recognizes
that  sustainable  agricultural  mechanization  can  have  potential drawbacks
but could also help address shortages of labour, ease drudgery,  increase
incomes, enhance productivity and the timeliness of agricultural activities,
promote  efficient  resource  use,  enable  better  market  access  and  attract
new  investment  and  talent  into  agriculture,  thereby  creating  better
prospects  for  sustainable  growth  and  support  measures  to  mitigate
climate -  and  weather-related  hazards, and acknowledges that mechanization
and digitalization can also create new  and  higher-paying  jobs  in
agricultural  value  chains,  making  it  more  attractive  for  youth to stay
in rural areas, and in this regard, welcomes the convening of the Global
Conference  on  Sustainable Agricultural  Mechanization,  organized  by  the
Food  and  Agriculture Organization, from 27 to 29 September 2023 in Rome;
19.   Recognizes  the  important  role  of  information  and  communications
technology,  as  well  as  digitalization  and  e-agriculture,  in achieving the
Sustainable  Development  Goals  and  in  improving  agricultural  productivity,
practices  and  institutions,  livelihoods,  strengthening  agricultural
markets  and  smallholder  improving  agricultural  extension  and  rural
advisory  services,  empowering  farmer  communities,  keeping  farmers  and
rural  entrepreneurs  informed  about  agricultural  innovations,  weather
conditions,  input  availability,  financial  services  and  market  prices and
connecting them with buyers, and stresses the need to ensure  that women
23-24665  26/57    A/78/461      and  youth  and  Indigenous  Peoples  have
equitable  access  to  information  and  communications technology,
digitalization and e-agriculture, especially in rural areas,  and to close
digital divides within and between countries, as well as the gender digital
divide, to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals ;
20.  Underlines  the  instrumental  role  of  agricultural  technology,
agricultural  research  and  innovation  and  technology  transfer  on  mutually
agreed  terms  and  the  sharing  of  knowledge  and  practices  in  furthering
sustainable  development  and  in  achieving the Sustainable Development Goals,
calls, therefore, upon Member States,  and  encourages  relevant  international
bodies,  to  support  sustainable  agricultural  research and development,
emphasizes that research outputs should be appropriate to  the  needs  of  and
accessible  to  end  users,  including  governments,  water  managers,  large-
scale  private  sector  enterprises  and  women,  smallholder  and  family
farmers,  and in this regard calls for continued support to the international
agricultural research  system,  including  the  research  centres  of  CGIAR
and  other  relevant  international  organizations and initiatives;    21.
Recognizes that agricultural biotechnologies can be harnessed and scaled  up to
enhance the productivity of agrifood systems, notes with concern that national
agricultural research systems in  developing countries face barriers such as
restricted  access, limited funding and regulatory frameworks to use advanced
biotechnologies,  and  in  this  regard  reiterates  the  need  to  accelerate
the  transfer  of  environmentally  sound technologies to developing countries
on mutually agreed terms;    22.  Notes that, according to World Bank estimates,
at least 300 billion United  States dollars in investments are needed annually
to promote sustainable food systems  and that many developing countries,
particularly low-income countries, are grappling  with  multiple  crises,
including  extreme  weather  disasters,  constrained  fiscal  conditions, and
escalating interest rates, making it challenging to finance emergency  responses
while  simultaneously  investing  in  sustainable  food  systems,  and  in  this
regard  calls  upon  Member  States  to  promote  a  concerted  effort  to
jointly  mobilize  public and private capital, to achieve high-performing food
systems;    23.  Urges  Member  States,  relevant  United  Nations
organizations  and  other  stakeholders  to  strengthen  efforts  to  improve
the  development  of  sustainable  agricultural  technologies  and  their
transfer  and  dissemination  on  mutually  agreed  terms to developing
countries, especially the least developed countries, in particular  at the
bilateral and regional levels, and encourages international, regional and
national  efforts  to  strengthen  capacity  and  foster  the  utilization  of
local  know -how  in  developing countries, especially that of smallholder and
family farmers, in particular  rural  women  and  youth,  in  order  to  enhance
agricultural  productivity  and  the  nutritional  quality  of  agricultural
products,  promote  sustainable  practices  in  pre-harvest  and  post-harvest
agricultural  activities  and  enhance  food  security  and  nutrition-related
programmes  and  policies  that  take  into  consideration  the  specific  needs
of women, young children and youth, with particular attention to securing the
prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, strengthening
progress  towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals;    24.
Recognizes that recovery efforts from the COVID-19 pandemic present an
opportunity to promote sustainability and increase resilience of agriculture and
food  systems to the impact of the pandemic and future crises, including through
the u se of  technology and innovation in all its forms, including digital
services that can increase  access  to  financial  services  for  small-scale
producers  and  family  farmers,  that  are  gender-responsive, including in
rural areas, to address mobility restrictions  and bank  closures,  agricultural
extension  services,  weather  and  climate  services,  and  online  platforms
that can enable producers to sell directly to consumers, leading to increased
profits,  improved  supply  chain  efficiency,  reduced  wastage  and  better
fina ncial    23-24665  27/57    A/78/461      inclusion,  leveraging
artificial  intelligence  in  supporting  sustainable  agriculture,  which  can
help to improve  the overall  harvest quality  and accuracy,  and calls  upon
all relevant stakeholders to continue to develop policies, investments and
partner ships  that  help  to  realize  the  potential  of  technologies  to
transform  agriculture  and  food  systems,  while  tackling  the  persistent
digital  divides,  including  the  gender  digital  divide, in order to build
back better and achieve the Sustainable Development Go als;  25.  Calls upon
Member States and relevant United Nations organizations and  other  stakeholders
to  mainstream  gender  perspectives  into  agricultural  policies  and
projects  and  to  focus  on  closing  the  gender  gap  by,  inter  alia,
encouraging  gender - balanced  investments  and  innovation  in  small-scale
agricultural  production  and  distribution,  and  a  gender-responsive  value
chain  supported  by  integrated  and  multisectoral policies, in order to
improve women’s productive capacity and incomes,  strengthen  their  resilience
and  achieve  equitable  access  to  all  forms  of  financing,  markets  and
networks,  labour-saving  technologies  and  agricultural  technology
information  and  know-how,  equipment,  decision-making  forums  and
associated  agricultural  resources  to  ensure  that  agriculture,  food
security  and  nutrition-related  programmes and policies take into
consideration the specific needs of women and the  barriers that women face in
accessing agricultural inputs and resources;     26.  Encourages  Governments
implement  youth-focused  agricultural  development  projects  and  programmes,
including  through  training,  education,  financial  inclusion  services,
including  microcredit  services,  and  capacity - building, including with
regard to innovation, in association with the private  sector, in  order to
stimulate the interest and the involvement of youth in sustainable agriculture;
to  develop  and    27.  Remains  concerned  that  agricultural  innovations
and  technologies  often  bypass  ageing  farmers,  and  in  particular  ageing
women  farmers,  as  many  do  not  possess the financial resources or the
skills to adopt new practices, and in this regard  stresses  the  need  to
strengthen  the  capacity  of  ageing  farmers  through  continued  access  to
financial  and  infrastructure  services  and  training  for  improved  farming
techniques and technologies;    28.  Acknowledges  that  technological
innovations  can  be  supported  by  financial innovations and financial
support, such as de-risking strategies and blended  finance  options,  and  that
blended finance  mechanisms  are  new  institutional  models  that link public
and private financing and patient capital with equity investments and  promote
schemes  that  more  effectively  distribute  investments  to  small-scale
enterprises and producers;    29.  Encourages  Member  States,  civil  society
and  public  and  private  institutions  to  develop  partnerships  to  support
financial  and  market  services,  including training, capacity-building,
infrastructure and extension and rural advisory  services, and calls for further
efforts by all stakeholders to  include smallholder and  family  farmers,  in
particular  rural  women  and  youth,  in  planning  and  in  taking  decisions
about  making  appropriate  sustainable  agricultural  technologies  and
practices  accessible  and  affordable  to  them,  and  strengthen  the  links
between  community-based  initiatives  and  financial  institutions,  including
through  the  promotion of financing tools that foster agricultural
sustainability;     30.  Requests  the  Secretary-General  to  submit  to  the
General Assembly  at  its  eightieth session, within existing resources, an
action-oriented report that examines the  current  technological  trends  and

23-24665  55/57    A/78/461      Recognizing that the feminization of poverty
persists and that the eradication of  poverty  in  all  its  forms  and
dimensions,  including  extreme  poverty,  is  an  indispensable  requirement
for  women’s  economic  empowerment  and  susta inable  development,  and
recognizing  also  the  mutually  reinforcing  links  between  the  achievement
of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and the
eradication of poverty,    Deeply concerned that, halfway through the 2030
Agenda, the world is failing    to achieve gender equality and the empowerment
of all women and girls,    Recognizing that unpaid care and domestic work
remains invisible, undervalued  and  unaccounted  for  in  national  statistics,
and  neglected  in  economic  and  social  policymaking,  and  that  women  and
girls,  including  adolescent  girls,  undertake  a  disproportionate share of
unpaid care and domestic work from one generation to the  next, as well as the
need to adopt measures to reduce, redistribute and value unpaid  care and
domestic work by promoting the equal sharing of responsibilities between  women
and  men  within  the  household  and  by  prioritizing,  inter  alia,
sustainable  infrastructure, social protection policies and accessible,
affordable and quality social  services, including care services, childcare and
maternity, paternity or parental leave,    Reiterating  the  need  for  gender
mainstreaming  in  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  all  financial,
economic,  environmental  and  social  policies  and  programmes,     1.
Reaffirms  that  the  commitment  to  achieve  gender  equality  and  the
empowerment  of  all  women  and  girls  will  make  a  crucial  contribution
to  progress  across all the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, that the
achievement of full  human potential and of sustainable development is not
possible if all women and girls  continue to  be denied their  human rights and
opportunities,  and  that the  systematic  mainstreaming of a gender perspective
in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable Development3 is
crucial;     2.  Invites  Member  States  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of
national  financial  institutions to reach out to those who have no access to
banking, insurance and other  financial  services,  particularly  women  and
women-led  micro-,  small  and  medium- sized enterprises, sustainable and
inclusive businesses, and digital entrepreneurs, in  urban and especially in
rural areas, as well as to develop and implement policies and  programmes to
support women’s entrepreneurship, in particular opportunities for new  women
entrepreneurs;    3.  Calls  upon  Member  States  to  ensure  women’s  equal
opportunities  in  education, training, business, entrepreneurship and decent

promote  a  gender-equitable  division  of  unpaid  care  and  domestic  work,
including  through  the  promotion  of  the  equitable  sharing  of
responsibilities  between  women  and  men  within  the  household  and  by
prioritizing,  inter  alia,  social  protection  policies  and  infrastructure
development,  bearing  in  mind  that  women  spend  2.8  more  hours  than  men
on  unpaid  care  and  domestic  work,  a  factor  that  contributes  to
greater  time  burdens  on  women  and    __________________  3  Resolution
70/1.    23-24665  56/57    A/78/461      substantially limits their
participation in the social, economic and political spheres,  and  considering
that,  on  the  current  trajectory,  the  gap  between  the  time  spent  by
women  and  men on unpaid  care  will narrow  slightly,  but  by  2050,  women
globally  will still be spending 9.5 per cent more time or 2.3 more hours per
day on unpaid care  work than men;   6.  Urges  Member  States  to  support
efforts  to  enable  all  women  to  have  leadership  and  decision-making
roles  at  all  levels,  and  work  towards  women’s  and  youth’s equal, full
and meaningful participation, including in all spheres and levels  of public and
political life, bearing in mind that, at the current pace, women’s share  of
workplace management positions will reach only 30 per cent by 2050;      7.

security and access  to,  ownership  of  and  control  over  land  and  other
forms  of  property,  inheritance,  natural  resources,  appropriate  new
technology  and  financial  servi ces,  including  microfinance,  and  ensuring
women’s  and  girls’  access  to  justice  and  accountability  for violations
of their human rights, with particular attention given to older women,  widows
and young women;    8.  Also  reaffirms  the  need  to  strengthen  the  efforts
to  realize  the  right  to  education  for  all  women  and  girls,
eliminating  barriers  in  this  regard,  ensuring  inclusive and equitable
quality education, training and skills development, promoting  lifelong learning
opportunities, and supporting women’s and girls’ participation in all  sectors,
especially  those  in  which  they  are  not  equally  represented,  in
particular  science,  technology,  engineering  and  mathematics,  and
strengthening  international  cooperation on these issues;    9.  Requests  the
Secretary-General  to  report  on  the  topic  of  the  resolution,  within an
