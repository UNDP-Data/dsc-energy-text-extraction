Programme rationale\n1. The 2017 general elections ushered in a new era in Angola, with a change of President after 38 \nyears. There is strong political commitment to strengthen democratic governance, justice and \nhuman rights, and fight corruption. Creating the first-ever elected local governments in 2020 is a \nflagship policy. \n2. Governance, justice and human rights institutions at national and local levels remain fragile in\nresponding to ongoing structural reforms and meeting citizens\u2019 growing demand for inclusive, \nparticipatory governance, transparency and accountability in public management and for effective \nservice delivery. \n3. Advances in democracy and rights are taking place in a context of tight fiscal space and \ndeceleration of economic growth,\nas result of the sharp decrease in oil prices and its related tax \nrevenues. Oil revenues accounted for 96 per cent of total revenues in 2017. This caused public \ndebt to rise to 91 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Public debt operations account for \n48.2 per cent of the state budget in 2019 and consume 70 per cent of fiscal revenues.\n4. Within this tight fiscal space, Angola aims to eradicate poverty. Thirty-six per cent of Angolans \nlive in extreme poverty.\nIn 2018, 51.2 per cent of Angolans were multidimensionally poor, with \n29.9 per cent in urban and 88.2 per cent in rural areas.5 The 2018 Multiple Overlapping \nDeprivation Analysis (MODA) on multidimensional child poverty in Angola concluded that \n77.4 per cent of children under 18 are poor.6 The Gini coefficient was 0.43 in 2008.Due to higher \nlife expectancy, Angola improved its human development index (HDI) to medium human \ndevelopment status, ranking 147 out of 189 countries in 2017, with an HDI of 0.581.8 The tight \nfiscal space underscoresthe importance of increased private investments that support achievement\nof the Sustainable Development Goals.\n5. Angola will graduate from the least developed country (LDC) category in February 2021, based \non the income-only criterion. The 2019 World Bank Ease of Doing Business Report ranks Angola \n173 out of 190 countries. The country is currently implementing the Programme to Support \nProduction, Diversification of Exports and Substitution of Imports (PRODESI). The \nunemployment rate is 28.8 per cent: 27 per cent for men, 31 per cent for women. Young people \nages 15 to 24 face higher unemployment rates, at 52.4 per cent.\n6. The major causes of poverty and unemployment are: non-inclusive economic growth due to \nlimited economic diversification, low investment in human capital, a challenging business \nenvironment, lack of effective employment generation programmes, gaps between skill supply \nand demand, limited access to quality technical and vocational education and training (TVET) \nand constraints faced by micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSME).\n7. The population is projected to grow rapidly, from 25.9 million in 2014 to 41.8 million people \nby 2030. In 2018, 46.6 per cent of Angolans were 14 years old or less. In December 2018, \nAngola agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on an extended fund facility for \n$3.7 billion, and committed to implementing several fiscal reforms that impact the poor and most \nvulnerable.\n8. Angola presents high maternal, child and youth mortality rates, and a high incidence of malaria, \ntuberculosis and other communicable and non-communicable diseases. HIV prevalence is 2.6 per \ncent among women, 1.2 per cent among men, 1.1 per cent among 15 to 24-year-old adolescent \ngirls and young women, 7.8 per cent among female sex workers, and 2.4 per cent among men \nhaving sex with men. Social determinants of health in Angola include the limited knowledge of \nprevention methods and access to prevention commodities, high cost of treatment and related \nservices, poor housing and sanitation, and gender inequalities. Youth, women, urban poor and \nsocially marginalized groups tend to be the most vulnerable to infectious diseases. \n9. Climate change has severely affected Angola. In 2012-2016, El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought in the\nsouthern provinces caused $750 million in damages and losses, with 1.2 million people affected, \nmostly women and children. The Government has developed a drought recovery framework for \n2018-2022, including the investment plan to enhance resilience. Lack of information on \ndeforestation, wildlife depletion and overfishing is a challenge; existing data show Angola is \nlosing natural resources. Angola has large protected areas and is planning its first marine \nprotected area. Solid waste management remains a challenge, with 1.3 million tonnes of \nhousehold waste produced yearly in the capital. Angola has made a strong commitment through \nits nationally determined contributions to reduce carbon emissions by 35 per cent.\n10. Only 42 per cent of the total population has access to electricity.14 Traditional energy sources \nare still widely used, including charcoal. Of the electricity produced and consumed, 64 per cent\nis from renewable sources, mainly hydropower.15 Seven solar hybrid plants were commissioned \nin 2018. Although the Government promotes private investment in renewables, and there is \ngrowing private interest, the insufficient legal and regulatory environment, low cost of \nconventional energy, and limited access to foreign currency remain barriers.\n11. Gender and women\u2019s rights and participation remain a challenge because of patriarchal \ncustoms and practices. Gender-based violence is widespread, with 8 per cent of women between \n15 and 49 claiming to have suffered some type of sexual violence; 35 per cent among ever-married \nwomen aged 15 to 49. Women represent 35.5 per cent of senior government positions.17 Gender \nbarriers remain inherent in the HIV context, such as unequal age of consent to marry and gaps in \nsexual and reproductive health rights.\n12. The National Development Plan (NDP), 2018-2022, has six pillars: (a) human development \nand wellbeing; (b) inclusive, diversified and sustainable economic development; (c) infrastructure \nfor development; (d) democracy, good governance, state reform and decentralization; \n(e) harmonious development of territory; and (f) stability, territorial integrity and the country\u2019s \nrole in the regional and international contexts. Financing for the $97 billion plan18 is primarily \ndomestic, with additional funding from international financing institutions (IFI) and an IMF loan. \nIn contrast, the official development assistance (ODA) estimate for 2018-2019 is $175 million.\n13. As Angola is undergoing political reforms and addressing major economic challenges, the \nNDP, 2018-2022, puts significant emphasis on maintaining stability and peace. Main challenges \ninclude managing the growing civic space, without risking instability, and effectively addressing \nsocioeconomic challenges.\n14. The UNDP rapid integrated assessment of the NDP, 2018-2022, revealed that overall \nalignment to Sustainable Development Goals-related targets is at 52 per cent. More investment in \nacceleration is particularly needed for Goals 1, 5, 10, 12, 14 and 15. The INE published the first \nnational baseline indicators report for the Goals in 2018, reporting on 41 per cent of total Goals \nindicators. Additional efforts are needed to improve access and quality of statistical information\nand promote a coordinated multi-stakeholder approach to monitor implementation of the 2030 \nAgenda for Sustainable Development. The voluntary national review of Angola will contribute to \nthis.\n15. Over the last three years, the UNDP country office has undergone a major transformation and \nis, at the start of the next country programme, a convener of multiple partners for the Goals and \nAgenda 2030. UNDP delivers quality policy advice and technical support and assists Angola in \nmeeting targets and requirements of complex funding mechanisms, such as the Global \nEnvironment Facility and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Because \nfunding through core resources is decreasing, reflecting the country\u2019s forthcoming LDC \ngraduation, Government funding to the country programme has increased significantly.\n16. The UNDP independent evaluation of the country programme for Angola, 2015-2019, found \nit contributed to: (a) poverty eradication, including mainstreaming the Goals into national \ndevelopment policies and substantive support to boost the national response to HIV/AIDS; (b) the \ncountry\u2019s graduation process, through technical support for elaboration of the first national report \non graduation to the Economic and Social Council and roadmap; (c) resilience, by improving\naccess to environment funds, enhancing efforts to expand protected areas, drafting a new national \nclimate change strategy, and developing provincial contingency plans in disaster-prone provinces; \n(d) participatory and inclusive governance, by helping the Government define strategies to \nimprove human rights, access justice and rule of law, and strengthen human rights and justice \ninstitutions; (e) gender mainstreaming, by supporting the Ministry of Social Action, Family and \nWomen\u2019s Promotion (known nationally as MASFAMU).\n17. The evaluation report recommended that UNDP engage further in mainstreaming gender, \neradicating poverty, reducing inequalities, and enhancing integration and synergies among \nthematic areas. It recommended the development of thorough resource mobilization and sound \nhuman resources strategies.\nII. Programme priorities and partnerships \n18. The UNDP country programme, 2020-2022, is based on the premise of \u2018leaving no one \nbehind\u2019 and \u2018reaching those furthest behind first\u2019. The programme includes integrated solutions \nto complex, interconnected development challenges. Three complementary priorities define the \n2020-2022 programme:\n(a) fostering poverty eradication and inclusive economic growth;\n(b) increasing resilience to shocks and crises and enhancing management of natural \nresources for conservation and economic development; and\n(c) strengthening inclusive democracy, human rights, justice and rule of law.\nThe components of these three priority areas are based on the assumption that \u2013 if poverty \neradication and inclusive economic growth are promoted, resilience is reinforced, and \nparticipatory and inclusive governance is strengthened \u2013 Angola will be able to accelerate its \nhuman development progress, end poverty in all its forms and reduce inequalities. The country \nprogramme will support Angola in effectively managing its development resources and bolstering\nthe voice of those furthest behind and their ability to hold government accountable. It will do this \nwhile building their resilience to shocks and crises through effective disaster and climate risk \nmanagement, and increasing their access to inclusive, equitable employment. Within the three \nprogramme components, UNDP will support the Government on the overarching national \nobjective in the NDP, 2018-2022, of maintaining stability and peace.\n19. Operationalizing General Assembly resolution 72/279 on the repositioning of the United \nNations development system, the country programme represents the UNDP vehicle for delivering\u0002as-one in Angola, guided by its United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF). \nWithin each of the three pillars, UNDP will deliver against the strong joint United Nations\ncommitment on youth, women and people with disabilities (UNDAF outcome 2). UNDP will \nwork closely with United Nations organizations through the common chapter of their strategic \nplans.\n20. The new UNDP country programme is aligned with the UNDP gender equality strategy, 2018-\n2021. It will address gender inequalities, including discriminatory practices and social norms, and \nwill strengthen investments in gender expertise and capacities.\n21. The country programme directly supports the country\u2019s international commitments, including \nAgenda 2030, African Union Agenda 2063, the NDP, 2018-2022 and key national strategies, and \nthe UNDP Strategic Plan, 2018-2021. UNDP will respond to government priorities through its six \nsignature solutions and contribute to the achievement of specific targets defined in the UNDAF \nfor Goals 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. \n22. UNDP will continue to work with the Government at all levels for effective implementation \nof policies and programmes, including projects funded from national budgets and IFIs. This \nincludes supporting the Government in aligning the NDP, 2018-2022, to the Goals and assisting\nin ensuring a multi-partner response to key multidimensional development challenges. UNDP will \ncontinue to act as operational support platform for other development organizations, and partner \nwith civil society and academia in advancing development agendas and building capacities.\n23. Innovation will be a core element of the country programme. UNDP will devote 5 per cent of \nits core budget to delivering innovative solutions to development challenges. The UNDP country \noffice is establishing an accelerator lab to create a learning network to test innovative ways of \naddressing development challenges.\n#Fostering poverty eradication and inclusive economic growth\n24. UNDP will significantly deepen its engagement to end poverty in Angola and reduce \ninequality through substantive analysis, dialogue and technical advice to develop more effective\nnational policies and programmes. The accelerator lab and South-South and triangular \ncooperation will be vehicles for prototyping new solutions. It will provide technical support, \nincluding for data analysis, in partnership with INE, government partners, the World Bank, \nacademia, civil society organizations (CSOs) and United Nations partners. UNDP will strengthen \nits partnership with the Government on analytics of expenditures and loan portfolio, measuring \ntheir impact in achieving the Goals.\n25. In support of PRODESI economic growth objectives, UNDP will work in partnership with \nMASFAMU, Ministry of Economy and Planning (MEP), Ministry of Finance (MINFIN), \nacademia, CSOs, the World Bank and African Development Bank (ADB), focusing on inclusive \nstrategies that help lift people out of poverty and increase their resilience to shocks and crisis.\nUNDP assistance will have two main elements. First, it will support policies and initiatives for \nself-employment and growth of micro and small enterprises, targeting sectors with high impact \non poverty reduction and addressing inclusion of the informal economy. Second, as part of \ngovernment initiatives to strengthen entrepreneurship and employment for young Angolans ages \n18 to 35, it will support government policy on vocational training, institutional development and \ntesting of innovative models, ensuring the most vulnerable sections of the workforce have access \nto skills and resources that match labour market demand. This will be done in collaboration with\nTVET network, private sector and International Labour Organization (ILO). UNDP will continue \nits youth internship programme and enhance it with the national volunteer programme.\n26. Through its global impact initiatives for the Goals, UNDP will contribute to mobilizing\ninternational and national private capital for financing development projects within the context of the NDP, 2018-2022. UNDP will help create menus and financial vehicles that stimulate impact \ninvestments in key sectors. In its integrator role, UNDP will facilitate the establishment of an \nengaged private sector platform through the umbrella of the Angolan Corporate Social \nResponsibility Network and Public-Private Partnership Initiative.\n27. UNDP will strengthen its support to national efforts for sustainable solutions in health, in line \nwith the UNDP HIV, health and development strategy, 2016-2022 (HHD). Building on its Global \nFund principal recipient role, UNDP will deliver packages of HIV prevention services to \nadolescent girls and young women, female sex workers, men having sex with men, and treatment \nservices to people living with HIV, including pregnant women. The UNDP core programming \napproach will be the social empowerment of these population groups through capacity \ndevelopment, involvement in service delivery and advocacy for sexual and reproductive health \nand rights. UNDP will contribute to strengthening the national health procurement and supply \nmanagement system.\n28. To reduce gender, legal and human rights-related barriers to accessing basic social services, \nUNDP will promote national ownership of the 2018 HIV legal environment assessment report \nand the national strategy for key populations, and revision of the 2004 HIV law. UNDP will \ndeliver capacity-building packages for advocacy to CSOs. Key UNDP partners include National \nHIV/AIDS Institute (INLS,) National Network Civil Society Organizations for HIV/AIDS\n(ANASO), CSOs, key populations-led associations, parliament health and youth commissions, \nMinistry of Health, Ministry of Justice, the Ombudsperson, United States Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS),\nUnited States President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), UNFPA, United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization (WHO).\n#Increasing resilience to shocks and crises and enhancing management of natural resources for conservation and economic development\n29. Building on the NDP, 2018-2022, commitments and early achievements in non-fossil fuel \noptions, UNDP will support low-carbon development. The UNDP de-risking renewable energy \ninvestments (DREI) initiative will provide policy support to boost private investments in \nrenewable energies, including in remote areas. UNDP is supporting private investment in off-grid \nsolutions, and renewable electricity for public infrastructure, including in the health sector.\n30. Through policy advice and implementation of GEF projects, UNDP will support the \nGovernment in the conservation of forest and protected areas by rehabilitating infrastructure, \ntraining, equipment, preparation of management plans, surveys of flora and fauna, engagement \nwith communities, combatting illegal wildlife trade, and establishing the first marine protected \nareas. These actions will be implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Environment \n(MINAMB), Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MINAGRIF) and Ministry of Fisheries and \nOceans (MINPESMAR).\n31. UNDP will scale up gender responsive disaster and climate risk management support, building \non its demonstrated results, adopting an integrated approach to resilience. Partnering with \nMinistry of Energy and Waters (MINEA) and relevant institutes at local level, UNDP will help to \nstrengthen water management practices at the community level and adopt flood warning systems. \nUNDP will provide training to strengthen capacities to cope with shocks and crises. It will achieve\nthis in cooperation with the National Civil Protection Commission (NCPC), MINFIN, MEP, \nMinistry of Territorial Administration and State Reforms (MAT), sector ministries and United \nNations partners.\n32. Partnering with IFIs, the European Union and bilateral agencies, as integrator, UNDP will\nhelp to boost investments in building the resilience of the 1.2 million drought-affected people in\nthe south, within the innovative common framework established.\n33. Addressing the country\u2019s solid waste management challenge, UNDP will provide technical \nand financial assistance to promote recycling, through the UNDP country accelerator lab, and \nsupport the elimination of toxic waste. Through integration and synergies within the country \nprogramme areas, UNDP will support entrepreneurship and promote green jobs, including for \nbiodiversity and waste management. UNDP will facilitate access to international funding, \nincluding through GEF, Green Climate Fund (GCF), and South-South and triangular cooperation.\n#Strengthening inclusive democracy, human rights, justice and rule of law\n34. UNDP will support efforts to ensure the first-ever elected local governments deliver on \npromises for democratic development and improved local service delivery. UNDP will strengthen \nthe capacity of elected local governance institutions and support participation mechanisms, such \nas participatory budgeting and civil society involvement in policy formulation, implementation \nand monitoring. Key partners include MAT, MASFAMU, Parliament, local governments, CSOs \nand bilateral donor partners.\n35. Through technical support and South-South and triangular cooperation with countries such as \nBrazil and Cabo Verde, UNDP will support transparency and accountability in public \nmanagement to improve services and finance development. UNDP will partner with the Office of \nthe Attorney General, General Inspection Services, Court of Auditors, Parliament and Public \nProcurement Services in developing standard operating procedures and tools for public \nmanagement to strengthen prevention and fight corruption. UNDP will coordinate international \nassistance for the implementation of the national anti-corruption strategy, 2018-2022, launched \nwith UNDP support. \n36. UNDP will support the capacity of justice and human rights institutions at national and local \nlevels to handle citizens\u2019 grievances and address human rights cases, including economic, social \nand cultural rights. This includes the core ombudsman function of the Provedor de Justi\u00e7a and its\npossible accreditation as the national human rights institution (NHRI). UNDP will partner with \nthe Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, Ministry of the Interior, Parliament, United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and CSOs. UNDP will help to strengthen the policy and \nlegal environment, alignment with international human rights principles and commitments, and \nsupport initiatives on crime prevention and security.\n37. UNDP will promote the inclusion of women in development and service delivery and their \neffective participation and representation in decision-making processes. UNDP will partner with \nMASFAMU and Parliament on capacity building and advocacy for sensitive gender-budgeting \nand development of gender statistics systems. UNDP will partner with MASFAMU, MAT and \nCSOs to promote a gender-inclusive framework for local elections and support capacity-building \nfor women to participate as candidates in local elections in 2020-2030.\n38. UNDP will support the participation of youth in governance processes by advocating for pro\u0002youth participatory processes and mechanisms. For this, UNDP will partner with MAT, Ministry \nof Youth, Parliament, the national youth platforms, CSOs and local governments.\n#III. Programme and risk management\n39. National and direct execution modalities will be applied for programme implementation, and \nthe harmonized approach to cash transfers (HACT) will be used to manage financial risks. In \naccordance with Board decision 2013/32, all direct costs associated with project implementation \nwill be charged to concerned projects. Together with other United Nations organizations, UNDP \nwill implement the joint programming framework and business operations strategy as part of \ndelivering-as-one.\n40. The country office will review its capacity to ensure it is positioned for effective programme\nimplementation. A human resources strategy will be developed and implemented, including to \nsupport gender mainstreaming within the country office, with the aim of ensuring country presence and profile with qualified, credible staff, backed by efficient operations. The country \nprogramme will benefit from the UNDP global policy network. Four major risk sources are: \n(a) financial and economic shocks leading to limited fiscal space; (b) fragmentation and limited \ncross-sectoral coordination to address development challenges; (c) inability to mobilize resources \nfrom key donors in the context of LDC graduation; and (d) ensuring UNDP space for technical \nadvice vis-\u00e0-vis development agencies offering larger financial contributions to Angola.\n41. UNDP will mitigate development financing risks by advocating for budget prioritization and \nreinforcement of national capacities in result-based budgeting. It will address fragmentation and \nlimited cross-sectoral coordination through national capacity development on integrated \ndevelopment approaches, in order to address institutional bottlenecks, planning and \nimplementation of the governance and human rights agenda. Within the country office\u2019s resource \nmobilization strategy, the country programme is expected to be implemented using increased \nresources from the state budget, in addition to donor and core resources. The country programme \nforesees expanding partnerships with IFIs, including UNDP support for accelerating\nimplementation of loans. With graduation from LDC status, core funding is expected to continue \nto decrease. The country office is developing a country programme action plan (CPAP), which \nincludes a partnerships strategy and action plan for resource mobilization, with Bureau of External \nRelations and Advocacy (BERA) support, and a communication strategy.\n42. All projects will undergo systematic review to ensure environmental and social safeguards, \ncosts and benefits of an intervention are evaluated in accordance with UNDP policies and \nstandards. Interventions will be scaled up or down depending on resource availability. Risk \nmitigation plans will be developed during preparation of programmes/projects, in collaboration \nwith national stakeholders.\n43. Accelerated procedures can be adopted to provide rapid response to crisis situations and to \nrespond effectively to new requests for UNDP support. The country office will invoke the \nbusiness continuity plan in the case of crises affecting its normal operations. \n44. This country programme document outlines UNDP contributions to national results and serves \nas the primary unit of accountability to the Board for results alignment and resources assigned to \nthe programme at country level. The accountabilities of managers at country, regional and \nheadquarter levels with respect to the country programme is prescribed in the organization\u2019s \nprogramme and operations policies and procedures and the internal control framework.\n#IV. Monitoring and evaluation\n45. A strong results framework (annex A) supports monitoring and evaluation of the country \nprogramme, aligned with national priorities, the UNDAF, 2020-2022, the UNDP Strategic Plan, \n2018-2021, the Goals and other international and national commitments. Based on the evaluation \nof the previous country programme, indicators are included to track change at outcome level. The \nprogramme theory of change will be reviewed on an annual basis and relevant changes reflected \nas necessary. \n46. UNDP will use, as far as possible, the national statistical systems and Goals targets to monitor \nits contribution to national results. When needed, it will use data generated by international \nagencies. UNDP will contribute to mitigate risks related to monitoring and evaluation, such as \nlimited capacities and availability of nationally owned data, by strengthening existing data and \ninformation systems, including improving data quality, analysis and use. UNDP will work \ntowards ensuring interoperability of existing data systems and advocate for increased use of data \nfor evidence-informed policymaking and monitoring of development results.\n47. UNDP will collaborate with academia, civil society, local and global think tanks in analyzing \nsocioeconomic disaggregated data to provide evidence of trends on vulnerabilities, poverty, \nincome and gender inequalities.DP/DCP/AGO/4\n48. UNDP will evaluate and monitor the country programme and related projects in line with the \nUNDAF monitoring system and UNDP corporate policies. It will set aside at least 1 per cent of \nits programme resources for monitoring and evaluation. The UNDP gender marker will be used \nto assess programme results, as a proxy for monitoring the programme\u2019s responsiveness to the \ngender equality agenda."}
