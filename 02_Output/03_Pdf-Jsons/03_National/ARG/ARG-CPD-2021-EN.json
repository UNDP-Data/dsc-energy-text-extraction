UNDP within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework\n1. Argentina scores very highly on the Human Development Index, ranked 46 of 189 \ncountries in 2020, and is classified by the World Bank as an upper-middle-income country, \nwith a gross national income per capita of $10,006 in 2019. Nonetheless, there is great \nheterogeneity between regions regarding indicators for productivity, well-being and social \ndevelopment. Alongside territorial inequalities, there are inequalities among population \ngroups, where socioeconomic inequities intertwine with gender, ethnic, racial and \ngenerational inequalities, hindering the possibilities to eradicate poverty, ensure sustainable \ndevelopment and guarantee human rights.\n2. The country faces high macroeconomic volatility, aggravated by the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic which generated an estimated 19.1 per cent drop in gross domestic \nproduct in the second quarter of 2020, while unemployment escalated by 9.2 percentage \npoints over the same period. This resulted in higher rates of poverty (40.9 per cent) and \nextreme poverty (10.5 per cent) during the first half of 2021, within a context of inflation \nrates over and above the regional mean (37.5 per cent in 2016, 47.6 per cent in 2018 and 53.8 \nper cent in 2019). There is also significant income inequality: the top 10 per cent of the\nArgentine population earns 25 times more than the most disadvantaged segment, taking into \nconsideration per capita family income. Over half (56.3 per cent) of children from 0 to14 \nyears old are poor. The most vulnerable are children and adolescents; lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntranssexual, intersex and other persons (LGBTI+); migrants and refugees; indigenous \npeoples; Afro-descendants; persons with disabilities; and those deprived of their liberty.\nWithin these groups, women face greater obstacles and more inequality than men.\n3. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on health and the economy, mainly \naffecting employment, income and the living conditions of the most vulnerable social sectors \n(women, LGBTI+ persons, informal male and female workers and the self-employed). Data \nfor the second quarter of 2020 show an increase in the Gini index compared to the same \nperiod in 2019, scaling up to 0.451 from 0.447.\n4. Although Argentina has doubled its protected areas in the last few years, it is not exempt \nfrom hazards and pressures brought about by the current development model, resulting in the \ndisturbance, fragmentation and degradation of ecosystems such as desertification, expansion \nof extractive activities, illegal trade of flora and fauna, invasion of alien species, the energy \nmatrix profile, pollution and climate change.\n5. Concerning institutional capacity, there are differences between jurisdictions and within \npublic sector institutions on efficiency, transparency and accountability; administration;\nplanning, monitoring and evaluation process upgrades; and coordination among the different \nstate levels to address and contribute to eliminating structural inequalities. There is a need to \nstrengthen strategies to access information across the country and ensure effective \nmechanisms for citizen participation.\n6. The Gender Inequality Index for Argentina is 0.354, placing it 77 of 162 countries. \nWithin this context of social vulnerability and economic contraction, it is even more critical \nto close the gender gap. To do so, the gender equality perspective must be further \nmainstreamed in all actions and the effective representation of women in decision-making\nmust be guaranteed.\n7. UNDP Argentina is recognized by all parties as a strategic partner contributing to the \nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2019 independent \ncountry programme evaluation underscores that UNDP has helped to improve provincial \nhealth-care services by providing support to the streamlining of the health system and the \ninterconnection of the health-care network. UNDP supported the implementation of the \nNational Food Security Plan through community organizations. It contributed significantly\nto entrepreneurship and production capacities, with positive outcomes at the local level. \nUNDP supported government efforts to promote information and communication \ntechnologies for open government initiatives, improving public service transparency and \nefficiency and facilitating citizen participation. UNDP has promoted access to justice, \nimproving the justice system\u2019s coverage and quality, particularly for disadvantaged groups \nincluding victims of gender-based violence. It also promoted women\u2019s political participation \nand economic empowerment, and the reduction of gender-based violence. UNDP improved \ninstitutional capacities in environmental governance and management, assisting the Ministry \nof Security in developing a national comprehensive risk management and civil protection \nsystem, and also the Argentine Ministry for the Environment and Sustainable Development \nin generating environmental data using upgraded information technology systems. \n8. UNDP will support institutional reforms; leverage implementation of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and environmental strategies at the subnational level; explore \nopportunities to strategically expand collaborative partnerships at the provincial level, \nparticularly in the north; continue to make progress in mainstreaming the gender perspective \nand rights-based approach in all sectors; emphasize programme integration, synergies and \nknowledge transfer; and reinforce the use of evaluations to learn from them and make \nevidence-based decisions. \n9. UNDP will continue partnering with the Government to reduce human development \ninequalities over the life cycle by strengthening comprehensive strategies and policies within \nthe Sustainable Development Goals.\n10. Taking into consideration its comparative advantages, UNDP will continue working as \na platform in support of achieving the Goals to: (a) establish partnerships by convening \nmultiple stakeholders to catalyse efforts and resources; (b) apply innovative approaches to \nidentify new ways of addressing challenges (new financial and legal instruments and \napproaches); (c) provide comprehensive responses through substantive advice including \neconomic, social and environmental dimensions, the human rights-based approach and \ngender and diversity from an intersectional approach; (d) provide support services to project \nexecution through standardized, systematic and proven management methods that ensure \nefficiency, transparency and accountability; (e) generate knowledge using innovative and \nempirical approaches; and (f) strengthen institutional capacities at all government levels. \n11. The country programme was developed along with and is fully aligned to the United \nNations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF). Consultations were \nheld with government counterparts including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International \nTrade and Worship; the Secretariat for Strategic Affairs of the Presidency; the National Social \nPolicy Coordination Council; and the Secretariat of Human Rights of the Nation. Dialogue \nand validation processes were conducted with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, International \nTrade and Worship; of Justice and Human Rights; of the Environment and Sustainable \nDevelopment; of the Interior; of Labor, Employment and Social Security; of Health; of \nEducation; and of Women, Gender and Diversity, among others. To include the federal \nperspective, a working session was held with the Federal Sustainable Development Goals\nNetwork. Contributions from civil society included the Ombudsman's Office, unions, non\u0002governmental organizations that work on human rights issues, the private sector through the \nGlobal Compact, and specific population groups such as youth, women, migrants and \nrefugees, the LGBTI+ community and representatives of indigenous peoples.\n#II. Programme priorities and partnerships\n12. The overarching vision of the country programme 2021-2025 is to reduce existing human \ndevelopment inequalities throughout people\u2019s lives, and to support the country\u2019s socioeconomic recovery by developing comprehensive policies to boost growth alongside\nsocial inclusion and environmental protection, ensuring an integrated social protection \nsystem that will leave no one behind. UNDP will contribute to eliminating barriers to access \nto basic services, reducing territorial disparities, mainstreaming gender equality, improving\npublic sector capacities, preventing environmental degradation and recovering affected \nenvironments, providing strong support to policy and programme implementation, capacity\u0002building and state innovation at the national and subnational levels. These priorities are\nreflected in the UNDP Strategic Plan, 2018-2021.\n13. Inclusive and sustainable development. The theory of change hypothesizes that if \nproductive initiatives at the local and regional levels foster sustainable entrepreneurship and \ninnovation in an inclusive manner, and also consider the impacts on the country\u2019s ecosystem,\nthen the productive matrix will be diversified, promoting labour-market recovery, \ndevelopment of sustainable financing and fostering social inclusion, emphasizing the \neconomic participation and empowerment of women and the integration of vulnerable \npopulations. The assumptions are that entrepreneurs, local companies and unemployed \npeople will participate and be better prepared to increase productivity and to join the labour \nmarket; and that the private sector will participate and offer resources. UNDP will work in \npartnership with government agencies, trade unions and the International Labour \nOrganization (ILO).\n14. Access to social services and social protection. The theory of change posits that: (a) if \ncommunity organizations have stronger capacities to ensure food security for vulnerable \ngroups and to provide community services such as health care and professional training, \nbased on a gender and diversity approach (applying signature solution 6); and (b) if \ninnovative strategies reduce inequalities in access to health services and address emerging \ndiseases, then hunger and malnutrition will be reduced and access to health for all will be \nguaranteed, with an emphasis on perinatal and maternal health, disabilities, prevention and \ntreatment of chronic diseases, access to sexual and reproductive health care, and prevention \nof unintended adolescent pregnancy. The assumptions are that training will be effective and \nhelp community organizations to better deliver services, that the population will engage and \ngo to health facilities and that public resources for health are available. UNDP will work in \npartnership with the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Health, the United \nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \nEmpowerment of Women (UN-Women) and subnational governments. UNDP will support \nthe creation of a comprehensive care system based on the co-responsibility principle, with \nthe participation of civil society organizations (CSOs), the private sector and families.\n15. Environment. The theory of change supposes that:\n(a) If the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development ensures the fulfilment of \nthe climate action agenda (applying signature solution 4), assuming that stakeholders are \nresponsive and provide resources and support, then the country will advance in achieving the \ncommitments of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster \nRisk Reduction 2015-2030 and other international commitments, promoting intersectionality\nand mainstreaming gender equality, intergenerational equity and disaster risk management;\n(b) If the rational management of chemical substances, products and waste is improved, \nassuming that proposals and activities are developed and support continues at the national \nand subnational levels, then human health and the environment will be protected;\n(c) If mechanisms are implemented for the protection and sustainable use of biodiversity, \nassuming that the participation of women, local farmers and the indigenous peoples in the \ncountry is assured, then the environment, human health and livelihoods will be protected at \nthe national and subnational levels and between sectors. UNDP will work in partnership with \nthe Ministry of Environment and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in \nsupporting the country\u2019s fulfilment of international conventions.\\\n16. Democratic governance. The hypothesis is that: (a) if institutional innovation and \nstreamlining of programmes are based on standards of transparency and accountability and \ninclude accessible digital interventions (applying signature solution 2 to strengthen effective, \naccountable and inclusive governance), and assuming that institutional engagement and \nresources are available, then the effectiveness of public policies will be enhanced to foster \nthe provision of public services and diminish the digital gap from a differential and \nintersectional approach; and (b) if effective participatory institutional mechanisms are \ndeveloped to access information and mainstream human rights, assuming the programmers\u2019\nengagement of intersectoral partners at all levels of government, the participation of civil \nsociety and the required funds, then equal access to justice for all will be enhanced, \nreinforcing the rule of law and human safety. UNDP will work in partnership with the \nMinistry of Justice and Human Rights and CSOs. \n17. UNDP will mainstream the gender equality signature solution in all actions. Considering \nchallenges identified in the previous programmatic cycle, UNDP, in partnership with UN\u0002Women, the European Union and CSOs, will emphasize the importance of allocating specific \nresources to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and LGBTI+ persons\nand actions to eradicate gender-based violence.\n18. Through its Sustainable Development Goal Accelerator Lab, UNDP will establish new \napproaches (sense-making, solutions mapping, collective intelligence, designing and testing),\nadjusting to the complexity of the current development challenges and the design of \ninnovative evidence-based instruments. Partnerships will be created and reinforced as a \nplatform for catalysing solutions and the exchange of knowledge, resources and solutions \namong government, civil society, academia and the private sector.\n19. UNDP will strengthen its partnership strategy with stakeholders involved in \nmultisectoral approaches. This will allow collaboration to catalyse efforts and resources. \nUNDP will continue strengthening its partnership with the Foreign Coordination and \nPlanning Secretariat as the public coordinating agency and will continue reinforcing \nrelationships with academia, trade unions, think tanks, CSOs and the private sector. The main \ndonors in this programme cycle will be the national and subnational governments and vertical \nfunds such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund. \n20. UNDP will extend its integrator role, seeking synergies with other United Nations\nagencies, different government sectors and other stakeholders, to provide comprehensive \nsolutions to complex development issues within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development. The office will implement joint initiatives (Spotlight, Joint SDG \nFund, etc.) and will coordinate actions with United Nations agencies in development projects, \nmainly in:\n(a) Preventing unintended adolescent pregnancy (UNFPA, United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund (UNICEF));\n(b) Eliminating violence against women and girls and femicide (UN-Women), ILO, \nUNFPA, UNICEF);\n(c) Mainstreaming human rights, gender equality and diversity approaches (UN-Women, \nUNFPA, UNICEF); \n(d) Preventing discrimination and violence against people with HIV (Joint United \nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS, Pan American Health Organization/World Health \nOrganization (PAHO/WHO), UNICEF); \n(e) Promoting an inclusive green economy through green job creation (ILO, UNEP, \nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization, United Nations Institute for Training \nand Research); \n(f) Strengthening childcare services (UNICEF, ECLAC, ILO);(g) Climate change mitigation and adaptation (UNEP, Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations), sustainable consumption and production (UNEP), the \nInternational Humanitarian Network) and wetlands regulatory framework (all programmes, \nfunds and agencies of the United Nations system in Argentina); \n(h) The local Global Compact network in Argentina (ILO, ECLAC); \n(i) Integrity, sustainability and transparency (UNEP Finance Initiative, Office of the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)); \n(j) Strengthenig capacities to prevent trafficking in persons (ILO, International \nOrganization for Migration);\n(k) Human safety and effective participation (PAHO/WHO, OHCHR, ILO);\n(l) Promoting human rights standards (United Nations system). \n#III. Programme and risk management\n21. This country programme document outlines the UNDP contributions to national results \nand serves as the primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board for results alignment \nand resources assigned to the programme at country level. Accountability of managers at the \ncountry, regional and headquarter levels with respect to country programmes is prescribed in \nthe organization\u2019s Programme and Operations Policies and Procedures and Internal Control \nFramework.\n22. The programme will be nationally executed. If necessary, national execution may be \nreplaced by direct execution for part or all of the programme to enable response to force \nmajeure. The harmonized approach to cash transfers will be used in a coordinated fashion \nwith other United Nations agencies to manage financial risks. Cost definitions and \nclassifications for programme and development effectiveness will be charged to the \nconcerned projects.\n23. The Foreign Coordination and Planning Secretariat will be the national counterpart in \ncharge of coordination, and other national and subnational authorities will be implementing \npartners. Programme execution will be coordinated with the United Nations system and joint \nprogrammes will be promoted. \n24. The programme will be executed according to a results-based management model to \nprogressively increase the level of efficacy and efficiency and ensure its contribution to \nnational priorities and the 2030 Agenda. The partnership and resource mobilization strategy \nwill focus on funding opportunities for innovative solutions to address complex development \nchallenges. UNDP will collaborate with the Government to facilitate South-South and \ntriangular cooperation, identifying and facilitating the systematic exchange of solutions, \nexperiences, innovation and good practices among actors from countries of the Global South, \nsuch as public institutions, academia, civil society, intergovernmental, subregional and \nbinational mechanisms. UNDP will support the country regarding its positioning in \nmultilateral bodies and forums.\n25. The creation and enhancement of partnerships will be promoted with other multilateral \ndevelopment agencies, the private sector and national institutions.\n26. The risk that could affect the scope of the country programme targets is greater budgetary \nand financial constraints within an economic slowdown, aggravated by the impact of \nCOVID-19.\n27. Within the post-pandemic social and economic recovery plan outlined by the United \nNations system, UNDP will follow up on the socioeconomic situation, providing an \nintegrated view to facilitate monitoring of the pandemic\u2019s impact as well as technical inputs \nfor designing and implementing response and recovery measures.\\\n28. The COVID-19 pandemic aggravated pre-existing health risks and could put the \nfunctioning of the general health system in crisis, making it difficult to treat other diseases.\nUNDP will support the ministries of health at national and subnational levels to provide equal \naccess to health and a healthy environment, addressing emerging diseases, with an emphasis \non perinatal and pregnant women\u2019s health, disabilities, prevention and treatment of chronic \nnon-communicable and communicable diseases (including HIV-specific services), access to \nsexual and reproductive health and prevention of unintended adolescent pregnancy.\n29. To ensure the expected outcomes, and in agreement with the UNDP Programme and \nOperations Policies and Procedures, the Foreign Coordination and Planning Secretariat and \nUNDP will periodically analyse and manage project risks. Risk monitoring will be used as \nan early warning, risk management and decision-making tool, seeking greater consistency \nand efficiency of cooperation outcomes. The UNDP social and environmental assessment\nprocedure will be used and support will be rendered to the key stakeholder response \nmechanism. \n30. UNDP will participate in the United Nations system Communications Group to work on \nstrategies and content related to joint programmes, special initiatives and mass campaigns. It \nwill also participate in bilateral meetings and teams work for the same purpose.\n#IV. Monitoring and evaluation\n31. Indicators defined in the results and resources framework will be used to follow up on \nprogress towards the achievement of development outcomes. Every year, UNDP will update \nthe database and will prepare a report to be shared with the Government during the annual \nprogramme review. The evaluation of actions carried out within the country programme \nframework will be performed according to the UNDP evaluation guidelines. UNDP quality \nstandards will be applied during the project life cycle.\n32. UNDP will encourage implementing partners to use specific, measurable, achievable, \nrelevant and time-bound indicators, disaggregated by gender, age, geographic location and \nother relevant variables, taking into account specific information on the most disadvantaged \npopulation.\n33. The gender marker will continue to be a key instrument for planning, oversight and \nevaluation to determine whether programme and project design meets the specific needs of \nwomen and ensure gender equality mainstreaming.\n34. Information to prepare reports will be taken from different sources: the National Institute \nof Statistics and Censuses, ministerial databases and those of other relevant agencies, \ninformation generated by projects and international statistics. Partnerships will be enhanced \nwith academic and public institutions and CSOs to help monitor development outputs and \noutcomes in a joint effort of the United Nations system.\n35. Programme and project evaluations will be carried out to identify lessons learned and \ngenerate knowledge in support of evidence-based decision-making. UNDP will support \nnational capacity-building to generate information, evaluate policies and contribute to \nexploring innovative approaches for public policy evaluation. \n36. Evaluations will appraise the UNDP contribution to national outcomes and priorities and\ndetermine achievements. Recommendations will be used as input for designing new \ninitiatives, making programme adjustments to ongoing activities, and incorporating lessons \nlearned and good practices. \n37. UNDP will consolidate comprehensive planning, monitoring, and evaluation to reinforce \nknowledge management and accountability, including mechanisms to identify contributions \nand select replicable innovative initiatives."}
