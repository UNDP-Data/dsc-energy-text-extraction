September 2010 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA\nArmenia 2010 Executive Summary Energy Efficiency \u2013  Government Priority The\nGovernment of Armenia prioritizes energy efficiency as  means of increasing the\ncountry\u2019 energy security, increasing economic competitiveness and reducing the\nnegative impact on the environment The Government\u2019 commitment and principles to\npromotion of energy efficiency are given in the Law on Renewable Energy and\nEnergy Efficiency (2005) and the National Program on Energy Saving and Renewable\nEnergy (2007) Armenia has significant potential for energy efficiency and can\nrecoup sizable economic benefits through utilization of this potential Although\nits economic activity is less energy intensive than compared to other economies\nin the region, large potential remains for further efficiency improvements (up\nto % of the country\u2019 GDP, as was estimated in  World Bank study in 2008) The\nhighest economic effectiveness through energy efficiency investments in the\npublic sector Other dominant sectors to be considered are the residential sector\n(buildings), industry, energy production, transport and agricultural sector is\nenvisaged Creating an Enabling Environment for Energy Efficiency The main issue\nto realise the significant energy saving potential in the country\u2019 economy is\nthe creation of an enabling environment for energy efficiency and financing of\nenergy efficiency investments This is mainly linked to  strong policy and to\nregulatory measures that need to be implemented and enforced Beside that, there\nis great unawareness and lack of information in all sectors (from private\nhouseholds to industrial enterprises) what to do in regard to reducing energy\nintensity and specific demand The country is looking for the introduction of\nappropriate market-based incentives for energy efficiency that are  necessary\ncondition to diversify Armenia\u2019 energy supply and thus improve economic\ncompetitiveness This National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) is another\nattempt following different programmatic activities in the past years to making\nenergy efficiency happen Although the country does have  Law on Energy\nEfficiency and Renewable Energy since 2005 and  National Program on Energy\nSaving and Renewable Energy since 2007, basic measures formulated in these two\ndocuments have not been implemented so far The NEEAP is therefore consolidating\nset of measures for all relevant economic sectors in the country and specifying\nthe need for action, especially on the political level It shall provide the\nGovernment of Armenia with  bundle of activities to be realised with different\npriorities in the considered period 2010 to The NEEAP focuses on five main\neconomic sectors The NEEAP is proposing  set of relevant measures to the\nGovernment of Armenia for improving the current legal status and enforcement of\nlegislation put in place, for  National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA\nArmenia 2010 capacity-building (mainly in the public sector) and institutional\nsetting, for creating awareness across all sectors and  general environment that\nis more in favour of energy efficiency improvement in the following sectors:\nresidential buildings  public and private service sector   industry & energy\nproduction transport  agriculture All in all, 31 relevant measures have been\nproposed within the NEEAP, all of them described in chapters  (horizontal and\ncross-sectoral measures and  (sectoral measures) The overall time frame for\nimplementation of the action plan is considered to be  period of ten years, from\n2010 until This is also in line with action plans of other countries Indication\nof Potential EE Targets For the purpose of the first NEEAP presented here,\nintermediate national energy savings targets have been proposed These\nintermediate targets shall provide an indication of realistic savings as\npercentage of the baseline demand to be achieved in the relevant target year,\nconsistent with the overall national indicative energy savings target However,\nmore detailed analysis of potentials and corresponding energy savings requires\nin all sectors is necessary, to provide  better data base and solidify the\nassumptions made regarding the EE potentials Lack of Basic Statistical Data One\nimportant deficiency is the missing of  detailed annual energy supply and demand\nsurvey for all main sectors of economy that provides data on the annual final\ninland energy consumption of all energy users for the most recent years,\nincluding data on:  energy supply (import, production, inventory changes)\nenergy transformation (primary and secondary transformation processes)   useful\nenergy demand according user categories (residential heating, industrial final\nenergy demand of all relevant sectors heat demand, stationary engines, lighting,\nair-conditioning, etc) Due to the missing basic data and with the information\nmade available from different sources, it is at the moment not possible to draw\nrealistic baseline scenario that will provide  sound base to estimate absolute\nsavings to be achieved in the target year Therefore, this first NEEAP provides\nonly an indication of annual savings in relative terms (% ) compared to the\nenergy demand of the relevant sector (to be defined) II National Energy\nEfficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010 where the proposed measures is part\nof They are shown in the following table and further explained in the chapters\nand  Table : Estimated energy savings cumulated for each sector until 2020\nEnergy saving target adopted in 2020: Residential/Households Industry &

available,  final energy demand per sector\n(in absolute terms), the second NEEAP (2014) will have to update this\ninformation and provide relevant data on the calculation of the national energy\nsaving target for the year 2020 as well as intermediate targets for the years\n2013 and 2017, as proposed in the template provided in Annex  Evaluation and\nMonitoring of Progress Made One important issue is to address regular monitoring\nand evaluation of measures in line with the proposed time frame, to assess if\nthe intermediate energy savings targets are being achieved or if increased\nefforts are to be made to get back on the implementation path It is therefore\nforeseen that the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources shall submit to the\nGovernment updated NEEAPs:   second NEEAP not later than 30 June 2014\n(considering implementation status until end 2013),   third NEEAP not later than\n30 June 2018 (considering implementation status until end 2017),  and  fourth\nNEEAP not later than 30 June 2021 (considering implementation status until end\n2020) The 1st NEEAP \u2013 High Priority Measures until 2013 The measures proposed in\nthe National Energy Efficiency Action Plan have been categorised into \u201chigh\u201d,\n\u201cmedium\u201d and \u201clow\u201d priority Main criterion for the high prioritisation is the\navailable energy saving potential with possible low funding implications (\u201clow-\nhanging fruits\u201d) or eventually already secured donor funding These measures are\nto be implemented within the first implementation

Armenia 2010\nIntroduction  Trends in Promoting Energy Efficiency In 2008 the World Energy\nCouncil published  paper about \u201cEnergy Efficiency Policies around the World:\nReview and Evaluation\u201d In this study it is shown that in most world regions the\namount of energy used per unit GDP is decreasing steadily: %  on average at the\nworld level between 1990 and Since 2000, this trend has however slowed down\nsignificantly, to slightly less than %  Industry is the main sector driving\nenergy intensity reduction in industrialized countries In developing countries\nand economies of transition, on the other hand, households are very often the\nmain drivers In China and the CIS, energy productivity improvements were almost\nequally driven by industry, energy conversion and households There are  few\nsignificant questions to consider when planning about EE improvement: What is\nthe importance of energy efficiency measures? What are the priorities? What are\nthe trends? How to introduce an adequate policy level to foster implementation\nof EE measures? And how to stimulate energy efficiency innovation cost\neffectively? The main factors for stimulating energy efficiency measures\nobserved are:  Institutional background: Almost all countries have set up\nspecific institutions dealing with energy efficiency, such as energy efficiency\nagencies, either at the national level, or at regional levels or both, and more\nrecently at local level Although the legal status of these agencies is different\nfrom one country to another, their establishment almost everywhere clearly\nindicates that there is  need for having  driving institution taking the lead on\nEE activity   proper regulatory framework, with  specific bundle of energy\nefficiency legislation and/or national programmes taking into consideration\nquantitative, measurable, targets for energy efficiency improvements, can\nprovide  long lasting context for energy efficiency policies and avoid the\nnegative effect of \u201cstop and start\u201d actions: many countries have already set up\nquantitative targets, with annual monitoring requirements  Electrical appliances\nand buildings continue to be the main target for regulations and are spreading\nto  larger number of countries In Europe, regulations represent about 40% of the\nmeasures implemented in the residential sector All European countries and most\nother OECD countries have energy efficiency standards for all new buildings Some\nnon-OECD countries outside Europe have recently established standards for\nservice buildings Altogether, about 60% of the countries surveyed had mandatory\nor voluntary standards for new non-residential buildings  National Energy\nEfficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010 The few evaluations studies of the\nsavings achieved with building codes show that the actual savings for new\nbuildings are lower than the potential theoretical savings This can be\nattributed to non-compliance with standards and changes in behaviour  more\nrecent trend is to extend regulations to existing buildings (mainly stricter\ncodes referring to thermal quality standards and introduction of energy\nefficiency certification of existing buildings)  Labelling and standards apply\nto  growing number of electrical appliances Labelling programmes and efficiency\nstandards are an effective method of transforming the market and slowing the\nelectricity demand growth Labelling programmes introduced in developing\ncountries are based on the experience of OECD countries and use models that have\nalready been proven: the European label has been used as  model in Brazil,\nTunisia, China and Iran, while labels introduced in Thailand and the Korean\nRepublic are based on some Australian model Energy labels and standards are\ncomplementary tools Labelling acts as an incentive for manufacturers to\ndifferentiate themselves from their competitors and stimulates the introduction\nof new, more efficient models Standards remove from the market the less\nefficient appliances To be effective, labelling programmes and performance\nstandards must be regularly updated  Energy pricing is an important component of\nEE policies Adequate pricing is  necessary condition for promoting energy\nefficiency One of the first steps of any energy efficiency policy should be to\nadjust energy prices to more \u201creal\u201d market levels in order to give correct\nsignals to consumers, whilst maintaining incentives for behaviour changes or to\nacquire energy efficient equipment and technologies Energy producing countries\noften maintain low domestic prices, which lead to intensive energy uses, as was\nseen previously by the high and increasing energy intensities in these countries\nreduction in the subsidies could lead to energy savings that could be sold at\nmuch higher price on the international market and bring benefits to these\neconomies Adequate pricing means establishing consumer energy prices that\nreflect the cost of energy supply,  the long-term marginal cost for electricity,\nthe long- term price of oil products on international markets for fossil fuels\nAlthough most energy planners agree with such objectives, they often face\nreluctance and opposition from decision-makers outside the energy sector, who\nfear public resistance and the impact of energy price corrections on the\nconsumer price index Also, energy is  basic good for which  low price is\ncondition for low- income households access This makes actual price adjustments\nslow or impossible in many developing countries, especially in the household\nsector  Financial incentives rely more and more on tax incentives than on direct\nNational Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010 subsidies\nNevertheless direct subsidies on energy efficiency investments remain popular As\nthey have often been considered as costly and questionable, they are now better\ntargeted Subsidies are viewed as  temporary measure to mobilise consumers, to\nprepare for new regulations, or to promote energy efficient technologies by\ncreating  larger market than would exist otherwise, with the objective of  cost\nreduction for the subsidised energy efficient technologies  Fiscal incentives,\nsuch as tax credits, tax reductions and accelerated depreciation, are usually\nconsidered cheaper than direct subsidies, especially to households, as they have\nlower transaction costs They can work well if the tax collection rate is\nsufficiently high: such measures usually perform poorly in an economy in\nrecession or in transition They are more adapted to well-developed countries: so\nfar, mainly OECD countries have implemented such fiscal measures Tax reductions\non energy efficient equipment or investments have been introduced in many\ncountries and almost equally in all regions: they are used in about 30% of the\ncountries surveyed  One of the main barriers to energy efficiency is the lack of\ninformation to consumers about what they can do To address this issue,  large\nrange of tools has to be designed:  general information campaigns, labelling of\nappliances and even dwellings rating their energy performance, audits, local\ninformation centres, education campaigns in schools and universities, case\nstudies, and comparative information  Audit schemes are  practical way of\ninforming consumers about the possible actions to improve energy efficiency They\nhave been mainly developed in industry and in non-residential buildings and are\nincreasingly made mandatory Energy audits usually are partially funded by public\nagencies or by utilities in European countries and are more often free for\nconsumers in the other regions to encourage participation Mandatory audits \u2013\nlike voluntary audits - assume  certain quality of the auditors as well as of\nthe staff responsible for energy management in the companies (energy managers)\nThis can be assured by the certification of the auditors and by the training of\nenergy managers  ESCOs (Energy Service Companies) and EPC (Energy Performance\nContracting) are  very attractive mechanism to capture cost-effective energy-\nefficiency potentials worldwide, mainly because they do not involve either\npublic expenditure or market intervention EPC can probably be considered among\nthe most effective mechanisms for promoting energy efficiency in the public\nsector and, especially in developing countries, in the industrial sector\nSeveral countries are introducing green taxes either on purchase tax or annual\ntax dependent on the CO2 emissions or energy efficiency of the cars Fuel\ntaxation plays  key role in promoting more efficient vehicles and more sensible\nNational Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010 driving habits Tax\nincreases are not always motivated by energy efficiency only In some countries,\nspecific CO2/environmental taxes have been set up for motor fuels ( Scandinavia\nand Germany) Green taxes are better accepted by the population, especially if\npart of the revenue is used to support energy/CO2 efficiency measures Road\npricing indicates an efficient way to enhance the energy efficiency in\ntransport, such as; the congestion charge in London  Energy efficiency\nobligations have been  success in the EU Member States They have been shown to\nwork in both monopoly and fully liberalised environment, both for supply and\ndistribution companies Energy efficiency obligations are attractive also to\ngovernments, as they do not have to support the cost of these obligations Energy\nefficiency obligations could be an important policy option for developing\ncountries to save electricity, as they offer  way for governments to tackle\nenergy efficiency at  modest increase on electricity customers\u2019 bills Energy\nefficiency obligations for utilities are  promising market-based instrument\nQuality labels and technical standards are effective tools for maintaining or\nimproving quality, provided they are successfully enforced ( the Keymark\ncertification scheme in Europe) The existence of independent certification\ncentres is  key element to ensure that imported products comply with national\nstandards The existence of skilled installers and of appropriate network of\nafter sales services is also essential for stimulating further dissemination of\nsolar water heating As  summary, the introduction and/or strengthening of energy\nefficiency policies are becoming increasingly important and  sustained effort\nwill be required over the long term To be successful, energy efficiency\nprogrammes need to be based on appropriate strategies, including for example:\nThe public sector needs to commit itself to EE and lead by example  Need for\nfavorable and stable institutional framework  Energy efficiency policies should\naddress all areas with energy savings potentials  To be efficient and cost-\neffective, regulations need to be well planned, regularly strengthened and\nproperly enforced  Adequate pricing:  condition for successful energy efficiency\npolicies\u2019 implementation to reflect more near-market conditions  Public/private\npartnerships to reinforce the effect of public policies  Quality of energy\nefficiency services and equipment should be strengthened through certification\nand testing facilities  National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia\n2010  Innovative measures should be promoted based on suitable experiences\nelsewhere  Regular monitoring and evaluation of implemented measures using\nindicators should be ensured  Energy Efficiency \u2013 the issue for Armenia The\nGovernment of Armenia prioritizes energy efficiency as  means of increasing the\ncountry\u2019 energy security, increasing economic competitiveness and reducing the\nnegative impact on the environment The Government\u2019 commitment to promotion of\nenergy efficiency is mainly reflected in the Law on Renewable Energy and Energy\nEfficiency (2005) and the National Program on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy\n(2007) The Law lays out the principles of the government\u2019 policy and governance\nstructure supporting energy efficiency, and provides for energy efficiency\nstandards, audits and awareness raising The National Program on Renewable Energy\nand Energy Efficiency identifies the sectors with the largest energy efficiency\npotential and provides an outline of technical measures/solutions to be taken to\nrealize the identified technically viable potential Armenia has significant\npotential for energy efficiency and can recoup sizable economic benefits through\nutilization of this potential While Armenia is one of the less energy intensive\neconomies in the region, largely due to the structural changes of the economy,\nlarge potential remains for further efficiency improvements Based on the\nNational Program on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, the World Bank\nperformed  study in 20081 which identified significant economically and\nfinancially viable energy efficiency potential The study found that Armenia\ncould save about 132 billion Armenian Drams (more than US$360 million) annually,\nequivalent to almost  percent of its GDP, through energy efficiency investments\nThe above study also identified  number of informational, legal, regulatory and\nfinancial barriers impeding energy efficiency investments There is an estimation\nfinancial returns of energy efficiency investments in public buildings have the\nhighest return with paybacks of two to eight years Investments in energy\nefficiency of public buildings cannot only free up the fiscal space, but also\nprime the market, by creating demand for energy efficient equipment and services\nand send  strong signal to the private sector and general public about the\nGovernment\u2019 commitment to energy efficiency the economic and that  \u201cThe Other\nRenewable Resource: The Potential for Improving Energy Efficiency in Armenia\u201d\nJuly, National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010 To aid the\nimplementation of the National Program, the Government of Armenia requested the\nWorld Bank to support with creation of an enabling environment for energy\nefficiency and financing of energy efficiency investments of public buildings\nThe proposed lending and TA project will contribute to achieving the Government\u2019\nnational priorities as it will help generate awareness of the benefits of energy\nefficiency investments, address other information and data gaps related to\nenergy efficiency, remove institutional and regulatory barriers, address\ncapacity weaknesses hindering the implementation of energy efficiency measures,\nand provide financing for energy efficiency investments in the public sector,\ndrawing on the recommendations of the National Program Moreover, energy\nefficiency is  key reform area for the development policy lending operations of\nthe World Bank in Armenia Under the development policy operation, the Government\ncommitted to adopt  time-bound Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) For the\ndevelopment of the action plan, an international consultant was hired by the\nMinistry of Energy and Natural Resources in summer 2010, and the elaboration of\nmeasures proposed in the following report conducted in  process of involving\nstakeholders from different ministries (Ministry of Energy and Natural\nResources, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of\nNatural Protection), the Public Services Regulatory Commission, Armenian\nRenewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund, the Energy Institute, utilities,\nthe World Bank, UNDP/GEF Armenia office, and gas and electricity companies\nScope and Objectives of the NEEAP The main objective of the action plan is to\ncontribute to the formulation of the future energy policy of Armenia and to\ndefine concrete steps for its implementation One of the main aims of the\nnational policy in the energy sector is defined to improve energy efficiency and\nto further develop the use of renewable energy sources The mentioned Law on\nRenewable Energy and Energy Efficiency and the National Program on Renewable\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy provide general policy measures and an\nassessment of energy saving potentials, however they have not been implemented\nso far The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan is based on generalised past\ntrends in energy consumption and presumes  further rise in energy demand up to\nIt takes into consideration earlier potential assessments made for energy\nsavings in different sectors of the economy and refers to past and current\nprojects/programmes dealing with energy efficiency issues and the main

measures The NEEAP The diverse projects referred to in the\nprevious paragraph are an important inflow of funds and financial sources into\nthe country, especially in regard to technical assistance, rehabilitation and\nnew infrastructure investments and as well awareness and these\nprogrammes/projects and proposes concrete measures per sector as well as\nhorizontal and cross-sectoral measures together with quantitative targets (in %)\nthat can be achieved by These targets need to be compared to  baseline energy\ndemand that considers the average demand for the -years period 2008-is building\nupon However, the first stage of the Action Plan presented here is not able to\ntake into consideration actual figures regarding final energy demand across all\nrelevant sectors of Armenian economy The problem lies mainly in the\nunavailability of reliable up to date statistical information on final energy\ndemand in considered sectors It is therefore been proposed to the Ministry of\nEnergy and Natural Resources to define the baseline energy demand during the\nfirst NEEAP implementation period (until 2014, see ) and provide the necessary\ndata background together with  second NEEAP to be submitted by 2014, while\nensuring this crucial measure, the elaboration of national energy statistic will\nbe implemented as soon as possible  Relevant Activities and Programmes related\nto Energy Efficiency in Armenia To encourage energy efficiency, Armenia has so\nfar taken several steps on the political and programmatic level: (cid:) Started\nto create  legal framework for energy efficiency In 2005, the Government passed\nLaw on Energy Savings and Renewable Energy, and has since signed the\nIntergovernmental standard draft building codes (for new buildings) which\nmandate energy efficiency but has not adopted it yet (cid:) Developed  National\nProgram on Energy Savings and Renewable Energy with solid data on energy use and\nenergy efficiency in Armenia (cid:) Has taken steps to improve the economic\nefficiency of energy use through improved regulation of energy utilities Several\nbarriers to economic efficiency which also affect the efficiency of energy\nresource use\u2014for example, highly subsidized energy tariffs, or the absence of\nelectricity and gas metering\u2014have been largely removed in Armenia (cid:)\nContinued to work actively with development partners like the World Bank, the UN\nDevelopment Programme, the EBRD, USAID and other donors on energy efficiency\nprograms to improve the energy supply infrastructure (electricity and heat\nproduction facilities, transmission and distribution networks) and heat energy\nuse in public and  National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010\nresidential buildings Relevant

projects and programs ongoing and of past\nof this document  National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010\nDefining Targets for the Implementation of the NEEAP Armenia can save greatly by\ninvesting in energy efficiency As mentioned above, previous studies made by the\nWorld Bank estimate the realizable saving potential to some  percent of its GDP\nThis is equal to energy savings of approximately 21 mtoe annually, or  TWh of\nelectricity and 600 million m3 of natural gas (based on 2008 demand) to\ndiversify Armenia\u2019 energy supply and Apart from the generated energy and cost\nsavings, energy efficiency is one necessary condition improve economic\ncompetitiveness And this can be achieved at less cost than investing into new\nproduction capacities or energy imports Energy efficiency investments are in\ngeneral economically and financially viable, especially the public sector\ninvestments provide the highest return on investment overall thus  Setting the\npath for Energy Efficiency in Armenia until 2020 The action plan is proposing\nset of relevant measures to the Government of Armenia for improving the current\nlegal status and enforcement of legislation put in place, for capacity-building\n(mainly in the public sector) and institutional setting, for creating awareness\nacross all sectors and  general environment that is more in favour of energy\nefficiency improvement in the following sectors:  residential buildings  public\nand private service sector   industry and energy sector transport  water sector\nThe overall time frame for implementation of the action plan is considered to be\nperiod of ten years, from 2010 until This is also in line with action plans of\nother countries Due to the fact that several measures have  longer duration,\nconsidering enforcement periods or reaction time until market actors are \u2018ready\u2019\nto implement energy saving measures in the mentioned sectors, the action plan\nneeds to distinguish short term, medium and long term planning:  Short term\nmeasures: referring to an implementation path during  first implementation\nperiod of the action plan from 2011-They refer to immediate action required in\nregard to policy making, institutional setting and awareness and communication\nThese are typical measures with significant energy saving potential with low\nfunding implications (\u201clow-hanging fruits\u201d) and eventually already secured donor\nfunding, which are classified with  high  National Energy Efficiency Action Plan\nfor RA Armenia 2010 priority in the action plan  Medium term measures: the\nmedium priority measures are expected to be implemented within   to  years\nperiod equalling the second implementation period of the action plan from\n2014-Long term measures: the timeframe is considered to cover  period of more\nthan  years The implementation is more complex and thus less easily to be\nadopted, or depending on the existence of an institutional and policy setting\nFor the consideration in the action plan, they are assigned  low priority and\nthus are considered to be implemented not before the third implementation period\nof the action plan between 2018 and For the purpose of the first NEEAP presented\nhere, apart from the list of measures, intermediate national energy savings\ntargets following periods of implementation have been proposed These\nintermediate targets shall define realistic savings as  percentage of the\nbaseline demand to be achieved in the relevant target year, consistent with the\noverall national indicative energy savings target referred to in chapter  the\nfor The targets set for this first action plan implementation period provide an\nindication only and have been determined based on experiences made (and\npublished) in other countries  more detailed analysis of potentials and\ncorresponding energy savings requires an in-depth national review of economic\nsectors, to provide  better data base and solidify the assumptions made\nregarding the EE potentials Regular monitoring and evaluation of measures shall\nprovide the Government and involved stakeholders with  clear view if the\nimplementation is in line with the proposed time frame, if the intermediate\nenergy savings targets are being achieved or if increased efforts are to be made\nto get back on the implementation path It is therefore foreseen that the\nMinistry of Energy and Natural Resources shall submit to the Government the\nfollowing updated NEEAPs:   second NEEAP not later than 30 June 2014\n(considering implementation status until end 2013),   third NEEAP not later than\n30 June 2018 (considering implementation status until end 2017),  and  fourth\nNEEAP not later than 30 June 2021 (considering implementation status until end\n2020) All NEEAPs shall describe the energy efficiency improvement measures\nplanned and realised to reach the targets set out in chapter  The following\nNEEAPs shall as well:  include  thorough analysis and evaluation of the\npreceding NEEAP; 10 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010\ninclude the final results with regard to the fulfilment of the energy savings\ntargets set out in chapter ; include plans for \u2013 and information on the\nanticipated effects of \u2013 additional measures which address any existing or\nexpected shortfall vis--vis the target;  use and gradually increase the use of\nefficiency indicators and benchmarks, both for the evaluation of past measures\nand estimated effects of planned future measures;  be based on latest available\ndata, supplemented with estimates  Baseline energy consumption and calculation\nof the national EE target Armenia can meet only roughly one-third of its total\ndemand of fuels, mainly natural gas and oil, through own resources, thus the\ncountry is highly dependant on imported energy sources On the other hand it\ncurrently benefits from an electricity surplus produced from own hydro power\nplants, one nuclear power plant and several thermal power plants From 2001 until\n2008, the amount of electricity consumed grew steadily at about % , which is\nless than the annual GDP growth average of -10%  Other fuels used for\nresidential heating, process heat, transportation and as fuel source for power\nplants have also steadily increased, in total about %  between 2001 and The main\nfuel type is natural gas In 2009, the preliminary figures show  decline due to\ngeneral economic crisis of electricity demand by about % and of gas demand by\nalmost 22%, compared to The following charts provide an overview of the\nelectricity consumption and gas consumption in the last  years (, 2009\npreliminary figures) that account for

573,000,000 m\u00b3 for natural\ngas (ca 25% of 2008 demand) These savings are mainly dedicated to the industry\nand energy sectors, as well as transportation and water sector References to the\nbuilding sector (residential and public/private services) are not found to be\ntoo specific there 17 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010\nAddressing Barriers for Energy Efficiency in Armenia Armenia has taken important\nsteps to encourage more efficient use of energy, but many more steps must still\nbe taken However, the potential is mainly untackled due to  number of reasons\nthat can be summarized in  list of barriers to addressing energy efficiency:\nThe legal framework needs to be implemented and enforced Especially in the\nbuilding sector the existing building code needs binding provisions regarding\nthermal quality of new and existing buildings and enforced standards and\nmethodologies to assess energy performance in buildings  Creating awareness\nabout energy efficiency needs  lot of information and know-how provided to all\nenergy consumers (private, business, service sector, etc) Yet, there is  weak\ninstitutional setting in Armenia of communicating energy efficiency with\nprofound capacity,  through  National Agency or NGOs  Private consumers (\nhouseholds) miss general and simple information on what can be done to reduce\nenergy demand in the daily life, such as in housing, use of electric appliances,\ntransportation etc  Many political decision-makers and private businesses still\nfail to see the value in energy efficiency investments, despite the successes of\ndonor-sponsored pilot projects and programs, because of missing awareness,\nsufficient current energy supply and to  certain extent because they simply lack\ninformation on energy consumption for and energy potentials in the main sectors\nThe natural gas tariff encourages wasteful use by some smaller customers There\ntariff structure does not provide an incentive for consumers to use less energy\nFurthermore, there are no other financial incentives available that would\nencourage saving energy The action plan presented in the next chapters of this\ndocument will address these main barriers and provide  set of selected\ninstruments and action to overcome the main legal, institutional, decision-\nmaking and information barriers 18 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA\nArmenia 2010  Horizontal and cross-sectoral measures  Overview of horizontal and\ncross-sectoral EEI measures Target: Provide the necessary institutional setting\nand capacity to implement the Armenian Energy Efficiency Action Plan and ensure\ncontinuous evaluation and monitoring of activities Target group: Ministries /\nAgencies Energy efficiency is not merely  matter of  single sector Many measures\nare intertwined and mutually supportive Energy efficiency measures affecting\nseveral or all energy consumption sectors are reflected within the horizontal\nactivities The main objective is to build up the necessary institutional\ncapacities that will ensure an established structure for the implementation of\nthe action plan The measures proposed are to focus on cross-sectoral issues for\nwide range of user target groups:  Legal aspects: integration of the NEEAP into\nexisting energy policies ( amending the Law on Energy Efficiency and Renewable\nEnergy by taking the action plan as one main instrument for implementation into\nconsideration); and the necessary reinforcement of the national energy statistic\nThe issue of public procurement of energy efficient equipment is mainly to\nprovide public purchasers with technical specifications and the necessary \u201cgood\nwill\u201d to consider the acquisition of energy efficient products and services by\nspending public money  Institutional setting: installation of  National Energy\nAgency The main responsibility for taking political action will stay with the\nMinistry of Energy and Natural Resources (legislation and policy making), while\nthe new Agency will implement, co-ordinate implementation, evaluate and\nregularly report NEEAP and give also technical expertise to government in\ndeveloping policies The institutional building will also require additional\npersonnel capacities within the responsible unit of the Ministry of Energy and\nNatural Resources (Division of energy efficiency) and special training should be\nprovided for new employees in international energy efficiency practices and\nstrategies (training financed by R2E2 and UNDP/GEF, employees salaries from\nstate budget)  Awareness, information campaigns and technical\nassistance/training on energy topics shall be enforced It is  measures which is\nvery long-lasting and needs to be reinforced all the time (through specific\ncampaigns and built-up of proper material and media) The described horizontal\nand cross-sectoral measures will factually not create any energy saving per se,\nbut will be the main driver for achieving savings under the following sectoral\nmeasures described in chapter  However, relevant indicators for monitoring

of private homes (family houses, multi-family buildings),\narchitects, planners, construction companies, legislative bodies  General\nintroduction on the building sector Almost all the Armenian housing stock has\nbeen constructed during Soviet period some  years ago without any regard to\nenergy efficiency Many of these buildings are now in obsolete condition and do\nnot provide for minimum hygienic and comfort living conditions Specific energy\nuse per square meter is almost - times higher than in EU and varies between 320\nand 690 kWh/m\u00b2 per year Nevertheless, in many households, the amount of space\nheated is limited to one or two rooms, as tenants have limited available\nhousehold budget to cover the high energy costs Also, construction works in\nArmenia are presently performed more or less according to former Soviet\npractices and norms that almost do not involve buildings\u2019 energy performance and\nimprovement issues Such designs and construction works result in excessive\nenergy consumption and growing amount of GHG emissions low thermal technical\nperformance reflects Currently, residential (and also public) buildings in the\ncountry are of low thermal-

to be covered in other building types, mainly from\nthe public and private service sector 25 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan\nfor RA Armenia 2010 According to preliminary research, via efficient thermal\ninsulation of residential and public buildings, it is possible to reduce energy\nconsumption for heating at least by 20- 40%, taking into consideration the low\nheating level in residential buildings Of course, the technical potential for\nimproving the building sector is much higher, and able to reach  minimum of 70%\n(and up to 90%) to leading New housing stock is largely privately owned and\noften built with limited financial means, therefore recommended to put an\nemphasis on low- and no-costs energy efficiency measures to overcome the lack of\nfinance, while strengthening enforcement of the new building regulations\ninadequate building materials the use of is It Used building materials are\nrarely certified or labelled for thermal quality, while imported materials and\ncomponents lack labels or are labelled in an inconsistent manner There is some\npotential for developing domestic materials, and  domestic production of quality\nconstruction materials could be developed through the use of licenses for\nforeign components However, this would require substantial investments in plants\ncapacity, technology adaptation, training and marketing that seem to be\npremature at this stage, given limited market size Such investments would only\nbe viable when the standards enforcement capacities are in place, and when  real\ndemand is effective on the market Since 2004, Armenia is involved in the\nEuropean Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) The implementation of ENP action plan was\napproved in 2006 and is to contribute to harmonization of Armenian legislation,\nnorms and standards with EU criteria In this regard, improvement of energy\nefficiency of buildings and constructions also needs paying attention to EU\ndirectives According to EU Directive on \u201cEnergy Performance of Buildings\u201d, cap\nvalues of energy consumption in buildings, buildings\u2019 efficiency rankings,\nspecific consumption of thermal energy for heating etc Should be identified upon\ndiscretion of each country based on climatic conditions, technical and\ndemographic data At the same time, improvement of buildings\u2019 energy efficiency\nlevel is reflected in certain provisions of the Armenian \u201cLaw on Energy Saving\nand Renewable Energy\u201d and of the \u201cNational Program on Energy Saving and\nRenewable Energy\u201d In this context, the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources\nand Ministry of Urban Development in cooperation with the \u201cArmenia \u2013 Improving\nthe Energy Efficiency of Municipal Heating and Hot Water Supply\u201d UNDP/GEF\nproject, initiated  harmonization process of standards relevant to the sector\nThe Project\u2019 work plan for  includes harmonization issues to international and\nEuropean standards  Sources: Towards Energy Efficiency Buildings in Europe\n(2004) 26 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010  Overview\nof sector-specific measures Summarizing one can say that apart from climate, the\nenergy consumption in the building sector is significantly affected by the\nthermal-technical properties of buildings, the efficiency of heating and cooling\nsystems, their regular inspection, maintenance and the behaviour of residents\nThis fact not only refers to residential buildings, but the same is true for\npublic and private service buildings The main barriers in the building sector\ncan be therefore defined as follows:  lack of available energy statistics and\nqualitative data on energy demand in the sector,  appropriate legislation\n(codes, standards, norms) and its enforcement to induce energy efficient\n(re)construction,  coherent strategy for building sector development and plans\nfor new constructions and renovation of existing buildings,  availability of\nfunds to support EE investments ( availability of  financing scheme to support\nreconstruction and/or refurbishment of residential buildings),  as well as\nknowledge and willingness of house owners, planners, architects and operators of\nbuildings to improve the quality of buildings and support residents in adopting\nenergy efficiency user practices; Therefore, the main target for the developing\nmeasures in the residential building sector can be specified as follows:\nupgrading existing legislation and all by-laws (standards, norms) to reflect the\nnecessary efforts to be made in increasing the energy of buildings,  setting up\neducational programmes (tertiary education, on-the-job-training) to train\nstudents and employees of companies in the planning/design and construction\nsector to comply with new integrated design and building standards,  establish\nnecessary capacities on the enforcement level,  develop pilot projects to\ndemonstrate building best-practice (for rehabilitation and new buildings) and\nprovide further incentives to promote energy efficient construction at all\nlevels, such as introduction of energy passports or building operational costs\nto be used for advertising those flats and houses for sale/rent adhering to high\nenergy efficiency standards (provide incentives for construction companies to\nenforce EE construction practices)  broad range of measures proposed for\nexisting and new buildings will account for approx 23% of total energy savings\nof the building sector projected under the Armenian NEEAP

towns/municipalities), public lighting\noperators, private office owners and tenants, employees in these companies\nGeneral introduction on the public and private service sector The Armenian\neconomy is agricultural-industrial oriented, with  developing service sector The\nstructure of 2004 GDP in Armenia is: 40% in industrial sector, 35% in service\nsector (including construction and transportation), and 25% in agriculture The\nshare of service sector is - times lower than in developed countries (%) The\nenergy intensity index in the service sector of Armenia, kg oe/$,000 USD is\nclose to that of many developed and developing countries: Estonia, 91 kg\noe/$,000 USD, Latvia, kg oe/$,000 USD, Czech Republic, kg oe/$,000 USD (see\nFigure ) According to the \u201cNational Program on Energy Saving and Renewable\nEnergy of Republic of Armenia\u201d paper (2007), the service sector in Armenia is\nexperiencing the same issues of energy efficiency as in developed countries and\nin general does not represent  high absolute energy saving potential Figure :\nEnergy intensity of economy in  number of countries in 2003, kg oe/thousUSD\nSource: Scientific Research Institute of Energy for the Alliance to Save\nEnergy/USAID: \u201cNational Program on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy of\nRepublic of Armenia\u201d; Yerevan 2007 as by Key World Energy Statistics from IEA:\nhtpp:/ 35 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010\nNevertheless, the role of the public administration in providing good practice\nand thus being  shining example for the other sectors is evident Public spending\nis  significant contributor to the countries\u2019 GDP The state administration, all\nregional and local authorities and other public institutions ( health sector,\nschools) regularly purchase energy consuming devices, such as office equipment,\nlighting, diverse household appliances (fridges, dishwashers, washing-machines,\netc) and other equipment used for air-conditioning, ventilation, etc It is\ntherefore of importance to provide the public sector with  clear strategy,  to\ndemand energy efficient applications and equipment and directing public spending\ntowards higher-quality products Energy efficient public procurement will provide\ncost- effective means to improve the energy intensity of the sector as slightly\nhigher purchasing costs will pay back within  couple of years On the other hand\nthe availability of energy efficient products on the market will steadily\nincrease, if the demand is rising Pretty the same issues are to be addressed to\nthe private service sector, although it is generally  very inhomogeneous market\nsegment which usually is not subject to direct influence by the government The\nissue for this sector is therefore to increase the awareness of the protagonists\nin this area \u2013 business owners, service companies, operators of office space and\ncommercial trading, etc \u2013 and provide them with  scope of measures that would\nfoster concrete action towards energy efficiency Although most of the energy\nused in service buildings is spent for heating and hot water (measures already\ncovered in chapter ), the growing demand for ventilation and cooling in these\nbuildings is  serious issue to be addressed in the countries energy policy\nOverview of sector-specific measures The operation of public buildings is\nrelevant cost factor in the public sector due to the share of energy costs in\nthe total budget Apart from lighting, heating and cooling of buildings and use\nof various equipment (ICT, office equipment, household appliances used in\noffices etc) are the most significant consumers in service buildings Together\nwith the improvement of the energy efficiency of mentioned equipment, efficient\nuser behaviour constitutes for  large saving potential (from 20% to 60%,\ndepending on the baseline consumption) in this area The general energy\nefficiency measures covering the building envelope are already specified in\nchapter  (also valid for service buildings) In addition to the energy\nconsumption in public buildings, operation of lighting in public buildings and\npublic street-lighting in towns and municipalities make  relevant contribution\nto the final energy consumption in the public sector Street-lighting projects\nare usually financed out of municipal budgets The current practice is that in\ncase of efficiency measures implemented (leading to savings in operational costs\ncovered by the municipal budget) the local authority is not able to dispose of\nthe energy cost 36 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010\nsavings, as operational budgets in this case will be usually cut by the central\ngovernment So there is no real incentive to realise efficiency measures Finding\nways to change this situation ( financing schemes, such as energy performance\ncontracting) will definitely increase the interest in becoming more energy\nconscious As for street-lighting, the largest consumer in this area is the City\nof Yerevan, in other towns and municipalities the issue of street-lighting is of\nless importance, mainly due to absence of fully operated lighting-systems\nLighting is, to  large extend, being consumed inefficiently, which results from\nthe use of obsolete light sources, unreliable regulation (switching, declining\npower supply voltage) and wrong positioning and location of light sources\nUpgrading of public lighting will focus on the installation of modern highly\nefficient light sources for public lighting as well and reliable and efficient\nregulation and management of operation The three measures proposed for the\nservice sector can save up to approx 15% of total energy savings of sector by\nHowever, as shown below, the effects are low in the short-term and will grow\nsteadily with increasing the penetration of efficiency measures in the service\nsector The % savings attributed to each kind of measures is being demonstrated\nin Table  The relevant intermediate energy saving target years, according to\nwhich the following energy savings are foreseen, are:  2013: %  2017: %

transmission distribution\nTarget group: Stakeholders in industrial production and energy utilities\nGeneral introduction on the industry & energy sectors Industrial activities: The\n40% share of industry in the GDP (2004) of Armenia is close to the one in\ndeveloped countries (%) The industry sector of Armenia has, as compared to other\nsectors, also  low energy intensity characteristic, kg oe/$,000 USD, compared to\nthe one for Uzbekistan, 2616 kg oe/$,000 USD, Estonia, 569 kg oe/$,000 USD,\nMoldova, 1264 kg oe/$,000 USD, and Georgia, 304 kg oe/$,000 USD (see Figure )\nThis means that the spectrum of the energy intensive production in the country\nis very low ( \u201cNairit\u201d factory, \u201cPolyvinylacetate\u201d factory use mainly\nelectricity, and cement, ore and mining industry is mainly depending on oil and\nnatural gas), and that the share of production using modern energy efficient\ntechnologies is fairly high (food production, non-energy intensive production)\nNevertheless, it is necessary to make use of energy efficient technologies and\nproduction methods which make it possible to reduce energy intensity of the\nproduction in the main energy consuming industrial sectors (such as chemical\nindustry, metallurgy), but also within the larger sector smaller and medium-\nsized companies Energy production: Armenia has no oil and natural gas reserves,\nand imports all its fossil fuel demand Electricity is provided by:   nuclear\npower plant which provides %;  Hydroelectric plants satisfy % of the country\u2019\nneeds Besides, the hydropower generation is declining due to limitations\nassociated with irrigation purposes of the hydro plants;  The remaining\nelectricity demand is satisfied by thermal power plants which can burn either\noil or natural gas The share of the thermal plants in the generation mix of the\ncountry is on average % In the heating sector, due to the consequences of the\neconomic and 41 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010\nenergy crisis that followed the separation of Armenia and its neighboring\ncountries from the former Soviet Union in 1990, the municipal heat and hot water\nsupply systems in all Armenian cities essentially collapsed While in some cities\nthe operations of the former, centralized district heating (DH) system have been\npartially restored, the vast majority of the urban population still lacks\norganized heat and hot water supply services Nowadays, in larger public and\nprivate service buildings there is often  centralised boiler house existing,\nwhile in residential buildings local heating systems prevail Many of these\ncentralised boiler houses are operated inefficiently or are generally old They\nwould need  focus within the Action Plan to undergo major refurbishment or\nreconstruction  Overview of sector-specific measures The measures to improve\nenergy efficiency in the industry sector must be particularly targeted at energy\ndemand, monitoring and management in the individual technological processes,\nintroduction of innovative approaches primarily aimed at reducing the energy\nintensity of industrial production, and investments in energy efficiency in the\nselected industrial branches Generally, there is  lack of awareness and\nknowledge on potential EE measures as well as incentives to implement them In\norder for these measures to be effective,  change must occur in people\u2019\nmentalities and behaviour The National Program on Energy Saving and Renewable\nEnergy has assessed  series of measures throughout the specific sectors, which\nneed to be tackled Reference is therefore made to the existing potential\nanalyses and studies, one of which was also prepared by the International\nFinance Co-operation (IFC), that is helping Armenian financial institutions\ndevelop sustainable energy finance products, thereby increasing renewable energy\ngeneration and lowering electricity waste and greenhouse-gas emissions Another\nof these sustainable energy financing institutions (\u201cArmSEFF\u201d programme, see\nAnnex : List of relevant donor projects and programs ongoing and of past) is\nbeing developed by the EBRD (envisaged start: autumn 2010)  focus is also to be\ngiven to the power and gas sector Obsolete and old infrastructure,  high share\nof production and transmission losses are putting  pressure on the utilities to\nmaintain their systems reliable and make them fit for the future \u2013 which is\nshowing sharp increases of energy demand (up to 10%  until 2020, once the\n\u201ceconomic crisis\u201d is over) Although there are several programs running with\nsupport from  the World Bank, continuous improvement and maintenance of existing\nenergy production and distribution facilities remains  high priority for\nensuring  sustainable and reliable energy system Together with the improvement\nof the infrastructure, measures to ensure the affordability of gas and\nelectricity tariffs (as described as an improvement measure in chapter ) have to\nbe enforced  summary of the critical measures proposed can be found in 42\nNational Energy Efficiency Action Plan

transport sector Target: Target group: Reduction and\nminimisation of energy consumption in freight and passenger transport;\nincreasing opportunities for public transport Traffic participants, transport\nroute owners and operators, transport, state owners and operators of means of\nadministration, local and regional governments  General introduction on the\ntransport sector The provision of transport linkages and transit carriages has\nkey role for the development of trade-economic relations between countries For\nall developing countries, especially those which are landlocked as Armenia, it\nis crucial to implement transit carriages in the light of the tariffs in use and\nto spur infrastructure development, modernization of available transport stock,\netc The transport policy of Armenia is conducted onwards transport network,\nelaboration of mechanisms for unification of legislative acts and other\nregulations Currently, Armenia is implementing the necessary internal state\nprocedures for joining to the existing agreements and conventions in the field\nof transport, which have been signed in the framework of UN Economic Commission\nfor Europe integrated Euro-Asian the creation of The Republic of Armenia, which\nhas  quite developed network of roads and railways, taking into consideration\nthe specific geographical situation of the country, extends major attention to\nthe modernization of transport infrastructures and for attracting investments in\nthe said sector, especially for the reconstruction of artificial facilities \u2013\nbridges and tunnels In regard with its effectiveness, high priority is given to\nthe implementation of combined container carriages and modernization of\ncontainer terminals The major issue, however, remain the quite underdeveloped\nmeans of public transportation means across the country ( under-utilised railway\nsystem) and especially within its largest city, Yerevan Individual means of\ntransportation are  huge traffic problem within the city ( there  ten times more\nminibuses operated than regular larger buses), causing congestion and high\nemissions from this sector Moreover, the electrified transport means, such as\nrailway, trolley buses or metro (one line in Yerevan) are playing  very limited\nrole in transport means of the country The share of different public\ntransportation means in Yerevan (2008) are: trolley buses ca %, metro %, large\nand medium buses % and micro buses ca 85% The big challenge is increase the\nshare of public transportation systems (large and trolley buses, metro) compared\nto the high number of micro buses and individual private cars  Overview of\nsector-specific measures The energy saving measures for the transport sector\ninclude the development of 48 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA\nArmenia 2010 specific emission norms for vehicles in combination with some\nincentives to reduce the emission level, further the optimization of vehicles\nand routes, especially when it comes to the introduction of new energy efficient\npublic transportation to force the replacement of old vehicles with newer,\nefficient ones, but still maintain the quite unique large share of gas driven\ncars in the world The worst polluters are however the large trucks, they are\nusually least efficient and increasingly congesting roads Regular inspection\nprograms shall be focussing on the vehicles causing the most pollution, and\nexpanded to other cars like mini buses, taxis and the majority of second-hand\ncar ownership in the country One important aspect is related to the creation of\nawareness among drivers to drive cars efficiently and consider opportunities to\nreduce the amount of annual mileage These measures shall be supported by the\nimplementation of traffic demand management schemes which can include  wide\nrange of options (such as parking restrictions or fees, tolls, restrictions by\nplate numbers) to help ease congestion in bottleneck corridors while promoting\npublic transport The proposed measures in the transport sector will account for\napprox 20% of total energy savings projected under the Armenian

In total, there are about ,800 mini-buses ( seats) running\non Yerevan' public bus routes, only about 300 larger buses (with  seats) They\nare operated by private companies that mostly use gas (90%) for driving them due\nto cheaper running costs However, mini-buses are one reason for increasing\ntraffic congestion in town which is becoming an environmental problem The City'\nplan is to replace in the long- term  mini-buses by  large bus (also being\noperated by natural gas, currently at about 50%) This will bring fuel savings at\nhigher capacity and contribute to reducing congestion Estimated fuel savings is\n% per passenger- kilometer The necessary measure is to adapt public tenders for\noperating bus routes, which are renewed every  years, and include large buses\ntypes have not as

Action Plan for RA\nArmenia 2010  Energy efficiency improvement measures in the water sector Target:\nStructural reforms in water sector, especially reduction of energy intensity in\nirrigation systems and for drinking water pumping stations Target group: Owners\nand operators of agricultural businesses / water supply  General introduction on\nthe water sector Armenia has  million hectares of agricultural land, 72% of the\ncountry\u2019 land area Most of this, however, are mountain pastures, and cultivable\nland is 480,000 hectares (452,900 hectares arable land, 27,300 hectares in\norchards and vineyards), or 16% of the country\u2019 area In 2006, 46% of the work\nforce was employed in agriculture (up from 26% in 1991), and agriculture\ncontributed about 21% of the country\u2019 GDP Back in 1991, Armenia imported still\nabout 65 percent of its food Agriculture is carried out mainly in the valleys\nand mountainsides of Armenia\u2019 uneven terrain, with the highest mountain pastures\nused for livestock grazing Fertile volcanic soil allows cultivation of wheat and\nbarley as well as pasturage for cows, sheep, goats, and horses The principal\nagricultural products are grains (mostly wheat and barley), potatoes,\nvegetables, grapes and fruits ( apricots) Agriculture provides  significant\nshare in the country\u2019 energy demand, mainly through intensive irrigation Almost\n80% of agricultural products are coming from irrigated lands, which generally\nuse electric pumping rather than free-flowing gravity schemes In former Soviet\nera, there were about 400 pumping stations in the country, and as electricity\nalways used to be very cheap, nobody cared about the additional irrigation costs\nThis has changed over the last years, especially due to an initiative started in\n2006 by the Millennium Challenge Account-Armenia (MCA-Armenia),  State Non\nCommercial Organization established by the Government of Armenia and supported\nby the Government of  through the creation of  foundation One main focus of MCA-\nArmenia is to improve current irrigation schemes by converting from pump to\ngravity- fed irrigation, reducing water losses and improving drainage and thus\ncontribute to  significant energy saving in the agricultural sector Another\nissue is the major energy consumption in the drinking water sector Support has\nbeen given for projects mainly financed by World Bank and USAID to emphasize\nwater sector reform to develop an efficient and sustainable integrated water\nresources management system Despite recent in performance of water companies and\nregulatory institutions, much remains to be done, particularly improvement of\nwater networks in the rural areas One issue is the rehabilitation and\noptimization of drinking water pumping stations across the country improvements\n53 National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for RA Armenia 2010  Overview of\nsector-specific measures The main measures regarding the water sector addressed\nin the action plan is following the activities conducted by the MCA Armenia\nprogram to rehabilitate existing drainage and pumping systems, rebuild existing\nsecondary and tertiary canals and introduce several new gravity irrigation\nschemes that will reduce the demand for electrical pumping This measure does not\nrefer to the agricultural sector only, but optimisation of pumping stations is\nalso  big issue in the drinking water sector and shall focus on water utilities\nChart : MCA-Armenia Irrigated Agriculture Project PS12 PS12 PS12 MC1 MC1 MC1 MC5\nMC5 MC5 GS1
