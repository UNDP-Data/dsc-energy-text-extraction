The Republic of Armenia is a landlocked country in the Southern Caucasus with a \npopulation of 2.97 million. It is an upper middle-income country with a Human \nDevelopment Index (HDI) score of 0.760, putting Armenia in the high human development \ncategory.\n2. Despite an increase in HDI of more than 20 per cent since 1991, 26.4 per cent of the \npopulation still lived below the poverty line in 2019, with 2.7 per cent classified as \nvulnerable to multidimensional poverty.\nDisparities between urban and rural areas, gender \ninequality, outward migration and high climate change exposure further impact the country\u2019s \nresilience, competitiveness and well-being. These pre-existing inequalities and \nvulnerabilities were amplified by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, driven by \nextensive disruption of businesses, income insecurity/loss and the deterioration of people\u2019s \nhealth and well-being, disproportionately affecting women, children, youth, older persons, \npersons with disabilities, people living in poverty, labour migrants, informal workers, \nentrepreneurs and remittance-dependent households.\n3. The recent large-scale military hostilities in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict area caused a \nmassive displacement from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia. Among an estimated 90,000 \ndisplaced people, 88 per cent were women and children who were housed in host \ncommunities and collective shelters. A significant number of the arrivals from Nagorno\u0002Karabakh may not be able to return safely even now with the ceasefire in place, particularly \nresidents of territories currently under control of Azerbaijan. Tens of thousands of them lost \ntheir homes and productive assets. The escalation has also left a significant impact on border \ncommunities, particularly in Syunik and Tavush regions of Armenia. The needs of people \ndisplaced and affected by the recent escalation, war veterans, wounded, newly disabled and \ntheir families, and families who lost productive assets or a breadwinner, need to be prioritized \non the basis of the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and \nindependence.\n4. The negotiated, comprehensive and sustainable settlement of all remaining core\nsubstantive issues of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, in line with the basic principles and \nelements within the framework of the internationally agreed format of the Co-Chairs of the \nMinsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, continues to shape \nthe humanitarian-development-peace nexus for the region, including Armenia.\n5. Armenia has undergone a profound transformation since independence, including after \nthe peaceful transition of power in 2018 which triggered renewed commitments to a human\u0002centred governance system, investments in human capital and the realization of the human \nrights agenda. These commitments will be operationalized through the 2019-2023 \nProgramme of the Government, sectoral strategies and the Armenia Transformation Strategy \n2050, with support from the re-established Intergovernmental Sustainable Development \nGoals Council, headed by the Deputy Prime Minister with the mandate to lead and monitor \nthe country\u2019s processes for nationalization and implementation of the Goals. \n6. UNDP plays a key role in ensuring a coherent United Nations strategy for collective \nimpact, under the overall leadership and coordination of the Resident Coordinator. As part \nof its integrator function, UNDP works with a wide range of public, private and civil\nstakeholders to facilitate recovery along the humanitarian-development-peace nexus and\nmore inclusive development solutions, at upstream policy level, advising on legal and policy \nframeworks, and at downstream level, turning projects into policies and policies into actions. \n7. The development challenges facing Armenia are complex and require \u2018out of the box\u2019\nsolutions. The UNDP national innovation platforms and the UNDP global networks\n(including the Global Policy Network and the accelerator labs) serve as important venues to \nleverage innovations, know-how and international expertise to achieve development \nbreakthroughs.\n8. During the preceding programme cycle, the UNDP activities and results in Armenia were \nhighly relevant to the Government\u2019s agenda as evidenced by the 2019 independent country \nprogramme evaluation and stakeholder consultations. In particular, UNDP was recognized \nas a valued partner in local economic development and community mobilization; natural \nresource management; enhancement of legal, policy and institutional frameworks in the \nenvironmental sector; disaster risk reduction; organization of transparent parliamentary \nelections; management of infrastructure investments and technical capacities of customs and \nother agencies; coordination of issue-based coalitions; women and youth empowerment; and \ncitizen engagement. \n9. UNDP underwent a sense-making review in 2020 to identify coherent cross-portfolio \nareas for action. Examples include the nexus of education, technology, inclusion and jobs, \nparticularly for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics; innovative \napproaches to public service delivery; and participatory democracy, active citizenship, youth \nempowerment and citizen engagement.\n10. The country programme will support all three pillars of the United Nations Sustainable \nDevelopment Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF): (a) people\u2019s well-being and capabilities; \n(b) green, sustainable and inclusive economic development; and (c) responsive and effective \ngovernance. Particularly, UNDP will address multidimensional poverty by building a deeper \nand more holistic understanding of what poverty and vulnerability mean in the post\u0002COVID-19, conflict reality and work across sectors to address the deprivations that leave \npeople behind. Regular human development snapshots will unpack emerging priorities, \ndrawing attention of policymakers through white papers and provoking public discourse \nthrough awareness-raising. UNDP will support the Government\u2019s future-proof strategic \nplanning by embedding foresight and scenario design at national and subnational levels, \nincluding in crisis preparedness. \n11. A key direction of the UNSDCF is to address the socioeconomic impacts of the\ncompound crisis. Building on the socioeconomic/early recovery efforts of the United \nNations, technically led by UNDP and coordinated by the Resident Coordinator, UNDP will \nwork hand in hand with the Government, United Nations agencies, international financial \ninstitutions (IFIs) and other development partners to bring various mandates and experiences \ninto coherent actions that will help the country\u2019s recovery to be more resilient, more people\u0002centred and greener. The comparative advantages of UNDP include the ability to collect,\nmanage and analyse data and leverage digital solutions and innovative approaches to help \nthe country transition towards risk-informed and evidence-based development. \n12. UNDP plays an important role in joint programming and implementation in Armenia. In \nthe period 2021-2025, UNDP will work to create an integrated innovation platform as part \nof shifting to the next-generation UNDP, using its innovation platforms as internal service \nproviders to United Nations agencies and for exploratory and catalytic joint programming \nwith the Government and other partners. The platforms have influenced the UNDP approach\nto innovation globally and efforts to scale this approach will be further explored during this \nprogramme cycle through South-South and/or triangular cooperation. \n13. UNDP is well positioned to facilitate a stronger engagement between the United Nations \nand the private sector and to leverage the wealth of human capital in the country. A priority \nis to deploy new and innovative development financing options enabled through public\u0002private partnerships and better alignment between financial market incentives and long-term \ndevelopment.\n#II. Programme priorities and partnerships\n14. The vision for the country programme is for Armenia to become a more cohesive, \ninclusive, just and resilient society supported by governance systems that use evidence, \ncitizen-centred innovation and partnerships to ensure social, economic and environmental \nsustainability and prosperity for all. Important sub-elements of the vision are: (a) people are \nhealthy, skilled and resilient to poverty, external shocks and disasters; (b) people enjoy equal \nrights and opportunities regardless of their personal characteristics; (c) natural resources are \nmanaged sustainably with respect for the needs of future generations; (d) governance systems \nare people-centred and effective, ensuring political stability, transparency and social \ncohesion; and (e) the economy is knowledge-based, green and competitive, thus capable of \nattracting investments, creating jobs and facilitating the return of migrants.\n15. The compound crisis has exacerbated issues in Armenian society that limit potential, \ncompetitiveness and capabilities at both individual and institutional levels. UNDP will focus \non a more future-oriented and integrated way of helping to shape and realize a new narrative \nfor Armenia. This means an increased focus on understanding and tackling pre-existing and \nemerging vulnerabilities and risks in the crisis setting and an upper-middle-income context, \nmany of which were revealed by the socioeconomic impact assessment of COVID-19.\nIt will also entail support for a renewed social contract between citizens and the State; \nrebuilding social cohesion and trust; investing in science and developing national research\nand development capacities; supporting the private sector to adopt sustainable models for a \ngreen recovery; and helping the Government build its strategic view of territorial \ndevelopment, linked to addressing depopulation in remote rural areas and secondary towns. \nUNDP will support Armenia to reimagine and evolve its governance systems, making them \nmore agile, effective, service-oriented and shock-resilient, underpinned by a strong civic\nculture and linked to real investments in human capital development. Moreover, as a result \nof the escalation, the number of border communities within Armenia has doubled. These\ncommunities are vulnerable also due to the proximity of foreign military forces and the \nabsence of adequate infrastructure. The implementation of programmes aimed at the \ndevelopment of border communities, including the creation and rehabilitation of \ninfrastructure, particularly in the southern regions of Armenia, is a priority.\n16. The country programme is firmly grounded in a human-rights-based and risk-informed \napproach to development, guided by national priorities, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment, the UNSDCF and the UNDP Strategic Plan 2018-2021. To ensure that the \nprogramme effectively tackles the interconnected nature and root causes of development \nchallenges, systems thinking and participatory approaches are being applied. \n17. The country programme aims to achieve results across four key areas: (a) sustainable \nand inclusive socioeconomic development; (b) environmental sustainability and resilience; \n(c) democratic governance and gender equality; and (d) evidence-based policy, financing and \ninnovation aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals.\n18. The pathway to sustainable and inclusive socioeconomic development will entail \ninitiatives that promote early recovery and community resilience, including in border \ncommunities, targeting the most vulnerable groups such as war veterans, persons affected by \nconflict, women and children. Efforts will be directed towards risk-informed and sustainable \nurban and rural planning; income and employment generation for vulnerable groups, \nincluding in agriculture; infrastructure rehabilitation and development, including housing \nsolutions; and the realization of the country\u2019s human capital potential. UNDP will contribute \nto increasing competitiveness and connectivity in Armenia, thus helping to mitigate negative\nmigration trends. Solutions that use participatory approaches at local level will be pursued, \nwith a focus on fostering a culture of active citizenry where women and men enjoy equal \nrights and opportunities to influence and benefit from proportional territorial development. \nUNDP will further expand its work to strengthen livelihoods, promote a predictable, fair and \ncompetitive business environment and build social cohesion and resilience in areas affected \nby the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\n19. Support will include: (a) improving preparedness for socioeconomic and environmental \nshocks in rural communities and secondary cities; (b) the transition from subsistence \nagriculture to value addition, processing and precise agriculture using climate-smart, green \nand digital technologies, including irrigation systems; (c) investments in small and medium\u0002sized enterprises, local start-up initiatives and tourism development; (d) boosting \nentrepreneurship, especially for women, and facilitation of trade, investment and exports; \n(e) income-generation and employment initiatives, including rehabilitation and integration \ninto social and economic life for war veterans, wounded and disabled during the recent \nmilitary escalation in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict area; and (f) the development of a \nfuture-proof labour market. \n20. This will be enabled through the promotion of technology-based education, including\nimproved literacy in information and communication technology; professional exchanges\nwithout discrimination by age or disability status; inclusive and active labour-market policies \nwith focus on new skills, new jobs and talent management; lifelong learning and \nre/up-skilling, including through vocational education and training; and protection of labour \nrights. To strengthen social protection, UNDP will work with the Government to upgrade\npublic service models and strengthen local capacities to deliver people-centred and shock\u0002responsive services, including through digital and innovative modalities. These approaches \nare necessary to foster sustainable connectivity, including transport, which in turn will \nimprove the services and assistance available to the regions. The pathway to environmental \nsustainability and resilience will comprise efforts to mainstream environmental issues into \nnational and regional development processes, thus helping the country to transition into a \nlow-carbon, resource-efficient, resilient and socially-inclusive green economy that is able to \nadapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change. UNDP interventions will be geared \ntowards identifying, piloting and scaling up data-driven and tech-based smart policies and \nsolutions that are environmentally and climate-friendly, risk-informed and long lasting. \nUNDP will work on: (a) improving the institutional and regulatory frameworks governing \nthe environmental sector; (b) providing technical and financial support, including through \nsmall grants, for promotion of community engagement in co-management and monitoring to \nincrease local ownership, improve livelihoods and reduce poverty; and (c) mainstreaming \necosystem-based approaches into sectoral policymaking, community development and \nlandscape restoration. UNDP will advocate for a new social contract, turning people, \nparticularly women and youth, and businesses into actively contributing development \npartners. This will require all-of-society engagement, environmental education, behavioural \nchanges, new types of economic and fiscal instruments and public-private partnerships, \nincluding tapping the potential of the country\u2019s tech sector. UNDP will address energy\npoverty and insecurity by investing in energy infrastructure, unlocking retrofit markets for \nenergy-efficient and renewable sources and facilitate access to international climate financing mechanisms for mitigation and adaptation, including through climate budgeting \nframeworks.\n21. In light of the compound crisis, a green and resilient recovery will be boosted by \npromoting sustainable city concepts through low-emission and circular-economy models; \nhelping to design and translate nationally determined contributions; and including climate \nadaptation into sectoral strategies and action plans in line with the Paris Agreement. Stimulus \npackages will be developed to protect and promote nature-based/green jobs and livelihood\nopportunities in communities, specifically for the rural poor and other vulnerable groups such \nas war veterans, the newly disabled and the widowed and their families. National capacities \nfor resilience-building will be strengthened and gender-responsive public and private \ninvestments in disaster risk management will be stimulated. UNDP will pay particular \nattention to the environment-health nexus by mainstreaming a \u2018one-health approach\u2019 into \ncross-sectoral policies, financing and actions. This encompasses reducing risks to human \nhealth through sound management of waste, chemicals, air and water pollution and green \ntransformation of urban mobility and industry.\n22. The pathway to democratic governance and gender equality includes efforts that will \nhelp strengthen trust in governance systems and service delivery capacity in Armenia. The \nfocus will be on building democratic, effective and accountable institutions capable of \nupholding human rights and the rule of law; preventing discriminatory practices and \nviolence; and strengthening the public administration system to ensure effective and human\u0002centred service delivery for all. UNDP will work to improve the transparency and \naccountability of decision-making and service delivery; strengthen access to justice and \ncombat corruption; address inequalities and protect human rights; reinforce the legislative \nand electoral systems; improve service orientation and promote excellence in the public \nsector, including the customs service and the police; and support the development of a new\ngeneration of smart public services for improved fairness and accountability at national and \nlocal levels. \n23. UNDP will promote participatory decision-making; strengthen the notion of the citizen \nas the \u2018client\u2019 of public institutions; support access to education, learning and self-realization; \nsupport ambitious future-proof strategies which build on people\u2019s collective aspirations; and \nbuild social cohesion and help to foster a new social contract. The work will be based on the \nprinciples of inclusiveness and address emerging vulnerabilities with a human-centred \napproach. This includes the creation of psychosocial and economic support mechanisms and \nthe provision of medical care, particularly for war veterans. UNDP will also promote \ntransformation (including digital) of the Parliament and other institutions to enhance checks \nand balances and ensure a \u2018whole-of-government\u2019 approach, strengthened separation of \npowers and cross-party work. \n24. UNDP continues to be a key partner to the Government and Parliament in the design, \nimplementation and promotion of open governance policies. The Parliament will play a key \nrole, serving as an important platform for evidence-based policymaking and citizen \nengagement. UNDP will seek to eliminate gender inequalities through targeted gender\u0002focused initiatives that consider the unique experiences, potential, needs and contributions of \nwomen, girls, men and boys. This will include efforts to dismantle structural barriers and \npromote the leadership and wide participation of women and youth in decision-making and\nhelp the Government to ensure that its strategies, plans and programmes are gender\u0002responsive. The programme will continue to focus on implementation and oversight of the \nHuman Rights Strategy and Action Plan; enhancing accountability of law-enforcement \nbodies, efficiency and public trust in the judiciary; promoting non-discrimination; and \nstrengthening capacities of the office of the Human Rights Defender of the Republic of \nArmenia.25. The pathway to evidence-based policy, financing and innovation aligned to the \nSustainable Development Goals builds on the UNDP integrator and convening roles and \non established platforms for innovation, collaboration and financing/impact investments. In \nline with the reform of the United Nations development system, UNDP will provide \nintegrated policy and programme solutions; support the development of an integrated \necosystem for collection and analysis of data on the Goals; support the development of \nevidence-based policies and frameworks aligned to the Goals using state-of-the-art tools for \ndata collection, modelling and forecasting; and transfer knowledge, behavioural insights and \ninnovation to help pioneer new ways of \u2018doing development\u2019\u201d. Specifically, UNDP will \npioneer an innovative portfolio approach to the development of the country\u2019s secondary \ncities, using innovative practices for reimagined urban development. UNDP will also work \nclosely with the Government to create links between policies, planning and budgeting \nprocesses and the Goals, and deploy innovative mechanisms to leverage partnerships and \nmultiple sources of development finance. \n26. The programme will prioritize co-designing a road map for an integrated national \nfinancing framework to help the Government mobilize the resources needed to realize \ndevelopment priorities. UNDP will initiate dialogues between the Government, the private \nsector and investors to provide a common understanding of financing and investments for \nthe Goals; stimulate innovative solutions through the implementation of impact acceleration \nprogrammes; and provide platforms for developing and piloting innovative financing tools \nsuch as \u2018pay for success\u2019 mechanisms or impact bonds. \n27. National and local ownership, diverse partnerships and deployment of local capacities \nwill be priorities. UNDP will expand its collaboration with all branches of the Government,\nincluding through exploring government co-funding modalities, and seeking to enlarge its \nnetwork of civil society and development organizations, media, innovation centres, think\ntanks, universities, the private sector, diaspora organizations and others.\n28. UNDP will strive to strengthen partnerships with multiple bilateral donors, international\norganizations and other emerging partners. UNDP will partner with IFIs, with a focus on \nscaling up key development accelerators related to regional and urban development, social \nprotection and data. Other key priorities are scaled-up partnerships with the private sector\nand diaspora organizations to catalyse development financing and the design of new \nsolutions that will help Armenia leapfrog, development wise. The Adaptation Fund, the \nGlobal Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund and other vertical multilateral funds \nwill remain critical partners, with a vision to scale up existing and introduce new \nprogramming areas in line with government priorities. In line with the reform agenda of the \nUnited Nations, UNDP will expand its portfolio of inter-agency partnerships, especially \naround the issue-based coalitions on social protection, food security and environmental \nsustainability, with a focus on supporting cohesive and integrated United Nations action, \nunder the leadership of the Resident Coordinator. UNDP will champion South-South and \ntriangular exchange, facilitating sharing of knowledge and experience on such topics as \ndisaster risk reduction, innovation and private sector development. \n#III. Programme and risk management\n29. The UNSDCF and this country programme were developed through an inclusive virtual \nconsultation process with public, private and civil society stakeholders. National priorities \nwere jointly determined within the United Nations country team, building on the Common \nCountry Analysis, national strategies, the COVID-19 socioeconomic impact assessment and \nfeedback received through online surveys. The findings of the independent country \nprogramme evaluation served as a basis for both programme orientation and anticipating and \nmitigating programmatic risks.30. UNDP will focus on portfolio/cross-sectoral programming and overcoming siloes,\nthrough a new generation of policy and programmatic initiatives being designed at the \nintersection of the four outcomes. Systems thinking will underpin this work, ensuring holistic \napproaches to complex problems. Projects will be clustered and interlinked across portfolios \nfor dense knowledge flows and spillovers and for risk diversification. To ensure \nsustainability and maximum impact, programmes will be designed with scaling-up and \nnational ownership in mind.\n31. To ensure agility and an effective response to underlying programmatic risks in Armenia, \nincluding the complex regional context, socioeconomic disparities, climate change and \nvulnerability to natural disasters such as earthquakes, UNDP will strengthen its procedures \nfor risk recognition, mitigation and diversification. This will include applying a cross\u0002practice/portfolio approach to programming and resource mobilization through partnerships, \njoint projects and dialogues with international and national stakeholders and United Nations \nagencies. Early warning and risk management will be enhanced through a risk dashboard and \na grievance-reporting mechanism.\n32. In line with global priorities, UNDP will enhance its focus on thought leadership, \nstrengthening capabilities related to data and research, digital solutions, policy analysis and\ninnovative financial tools. UNDP will tap the potential of volunteering, local and diaspora\u0002based expert networks, the private sector and inter-office exchanges as sources of skills and \nexpertise. \n33. This country programme document outlines the UNDP contributions to national results \nand serves as the primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board for results alignment \nand resources assigned to the programme at country level. Accountabilities of managers at \nthe country, regional and headquarter levels with respect to country programmes is \nprescribed in the organization\u2019s programme and operations policies and procedures and \ninternal control framework.\n34. The programme will be nationally executed. If necessary, national execution may be \nreplaced by direct execution for part or all of the programme to enable response to force \nmajeure. The harmonized approach to cash transfers will be used in a coordinated fashion \nwith other United Nations agencies to manage financial risks. Cost definitions and \nclassifications for programme and development effectiveness will be charged to the \nconcerned projects.\n#IV. Monitoring and evaluation\n35. Monitoring and evaluation of the country programme are aligned with monitoring, \nreporting and evaluation of the UNSDCF. UNDP will contribute to annual reviews of the \nUNSDCF and the joint evaluation of outcomes to validate progress in relation to envisaged \nshort-term and long-term results. \n36. Drawing lessons from the independent country programme evaluation and country office \nevaluations, UNDP has strengthened its learning and adaptive management policies, thus \nbecoming a more agile and effective partner of choice. In addition to the results and resources \nframework and project result frameworks to monitor outputs and outcomes, the UNDP social \nand environmental standards and accountability mechanism will be used to identify, monitor \nand mitigate risks. Annual reviews will assess and validate progress towards results with \nspecial attention to multidimensional challenges.\n37. UNDP, in collaboration with other United Nations agencies, will continue to support the \nStatistical Committee of Armenia (ArmStat) and other counterparts to upgrade government \nstatistical capacities, support the development of evidence-based policies and strategies and \nstrengthen analysis for tracking progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and transformative changes on the ground, with particular emphasis on gender-disaggregated \nstatistics.\n38. In line with the recommendations of the independent country programme evaluation, \nUNDP has enhanced its monitoring and evaluation frameworks and staff capabilities and will \naim for higher-quality evaluations to inform programming and decision-making and promote \nlearning. UNDP uses specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound indicators to \nmonitor outputs and results. Stronger results-based management, together with \ncommunication and outreach, will ensure more effective reporting on impact and partnership \nachievements."}
