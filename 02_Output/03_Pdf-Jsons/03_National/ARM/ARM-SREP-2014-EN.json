Plan\nfor Armenia April 2014 FOREWORD An affordable, secure and sustainable energy\nsupply is essential for the prosperity of the people of Armenia, and for the\ngrowth of our economy Because of Armenia\u2019 dependence on energy imports, energy\nprices are largely beyond our control Over the past decade as we emerged from an\nenergy crisis, we learned the importance of developing our domestic energy\nresources, and transformed our government institutions to support private sector\ninvolvement in the energy industry In just  few years,  robust and thriving\nsmall hydropower industry has emerged from these efforts Despite this success,\nour energy sector remains vulnerable to price shocks and reliability problems,\nand climate change continues to threaten our natural resources and well-being\nYet in the face of these risks, we have  great opportunity: much of Armenia\u2019\nconventional energy generation infrastructure will need to be replaced in the\ncoming years If we can replace some of this with indigenous renewable energy\nresources, we can improve energy security while simultaneously reducing our\ncontributions to global climate change Furthermore, we can leverage our\nscientific and technical talent to build domestic renewable energy industries\nthat will create new employment opportunities for years to come At this crucial\njuncture, the Scaling-up Renewable Energy (SREP) Investment Plan will assist us\nas we chart  new future for Armenia\u2019 energy industry This Investment Plan\nidentifies the renewable energy technologies and projects that can best\ncontribute to the Government\u2019 energy, economic and environmental development\ngoals As such it is an update and further elaboration of the Renewable Energy\nRoadmap developed in It outlines the activities that must be carried out to\nrealize  new energy future by deploying technologies that have as of yet only\nbeen implemented on  small scale, but which have enormous potential Particular\nfocus has been given to minimizing risk for private investors in renewable\nenergy, and to initiatives that can help reduce domestic consumption of imported\nfuels SREP will support the Government in reaching its goals for the energy\nsector, and help leverage private sector funds to exponentially expand\ninvestment in clean, domestic energy resources Investment Plan was developed\ncollaboratively in The SREP consultation with representatives from Government,\nprivate industry and academia Our development partners, the WBG, the EBRD, and\nthe ADB provided expertise and support that was critical to the successful\ncreation of the plan  thank these institutions and  look forward to their\ncontinued support in this timely and important initiative Armen

document contains the\nInvestment Plan (IP) for the Republic of Armenia The IP is the result of\nextensive analysis led by the Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund\n(R2E2) and  wide-reaching internal and public consultation process, led by\ngovernment, to identify priorities in the development of renewable energy\ntechnologies for electricity and heating The consultations included  wide range\nof government agencies, as well as representatives from the private sector,\ncivil society, and academia The IP serves as an update and further elaboration\nof the Renewable Energy Roadmap developed for Armenia in The Role of Renewable\nEnergy in Armenia  Armenia\u2019 energy sector has made significant progress in the\nlast two decades The sector has moved from severe crisis\u2014characterized by\ncrippling supply shortages, and near-financial bankruptcy of the sector\u2014to\nstability more characteristic of developed countries than emerging markets The\nuse and development of renewable energy has been an important part of the\ntransition from crisis to stability, and will remain important in the years to\ncome as demand grows and ageing thermal plants are retired The historic\nimportance of renewable energy in Armenia Armenia has no proven oil or natural\ngas reserves and imports all of its fuel for thermal generation from Russia and\nIran The country relies on imported natural gas to generate roughly 30 percent\nof its power and most of its heat Nuclear fuel, which is used to generate\nanother 30 percent of electricity in Armenia, is also imported The remaining\nelectricity is generated by  series of hydropower plants in the Sevan- Hrazdan\nand Vorotan cascades, more than 130 small hydropower plants, and one small wind\nfarm Armenia\u2019 dependence on imported fuels creates security of supply risks as\nwell as affordability problems for customers The sector is highly susceptible to\nfuel supply interruptions and price volatility Between 1991 and 1996\u2014because of\ndisruptions in gas supply\u2014customers suffered through several of Armenia\u2019 brutal\nwinters with little more than two hours of electricity supply per day Meanwhile,\nthe import price of natural gas has continued to increase The increases of the\nprice of imported gas meant steady increases in end-user tariffs for natural gas\nand electricity Between 2005 and 2013, the end-user natural gas tariff increased\nby 170 percent End-user residential tariffs for electricity increased 52 percent\nduring the same time period The Government of Armenia has worked for more than\ndecade to expand the use of renewable energy  2004 Law on Energy Savings and\nRenewable Energy in 2004 provided for, among other things, the establishment of\nthe Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2),  non-governmental\nagency dedicated to promoting and facilitating renewable energy and energy\nefficiency in Armenia R2E2, with the support of the World Bank and GEF,\nimplemented  Renewable Energy Program that helped to remove barriers to the\ndevelopment of renewable energy generation, and create an enabling environment\nfor private investors The project was co-financed by EBRD and local private\nfinancing institution  In 2007, the Public Services Regulatory Commission (PSRC)\nset renewable energy feed-in tariffs for small hydropower plants (SHPPs), wind,\nand biomass to stimulate private investment The feed-in tariff regime guarantees\npurchase all of the power generated by renewable energy plants for 15 years\nTariffs are adjusted annually in line with changes in inflation and exchange\nrates The feed-in tariff has been successful in attracting private investment in\nmore than 200 MW of small hydropower More recently, Government took steps to\nstreamline the process of developing renewable energy projects, including\nrelaxing tax obligations for some investments The future of renewable energy in\nArmenia The historic threats to supply security and affordability are expected\nto continue in Armenia Therefore, the Government\u2019 commitment to developing\nrenewable energy remains as strong as before and there is now more urgency,\ngiven  looming gap between supply and demand Demand grew at an average annual\nrate of roughly  percent between 2004 and 2013, and is expected to continue to\ngrow at  rate of around  percent per year New supply will be needed since 50\npercent of available capacity is more than 40 years old, and one of the largest\ngenerating units in the system, the remaining nuclear unit at Metsamor, is in\nurgent need of investments Metsamor\u2019 retirement has been postponed twice, most\nrecently from 2021 until commissioning of the new nuclear power plant (expected\nin 2026) because of the difficulty in securing financing for it If Metsamor is\nretired in 2026, Armenia can expect  supply gap of roughly 830 MW, considering\nthe base-case forecast average annual peak demand growth of roughly  percent per\nyear Natural gas prices, too, are expected to increase Specifically, the import\nprice of natural gas could increase by more than 50 percent over the next 12\nyears depending on the domestic gas price increase in Russia and the US\ninflation to which the Armenia border gas price is linked to This will affect\nthe cost of power generation The current average cost of generation in Armenia\nis roughly US$ 035/kWh, but is set to increase to US$/kWh as gas prices\nincrease, and  new nuclear plant is brought online in The range reflects\ndifferent assumptions about the size of the new plant, and whether concessional\nor commercial financing is used to finance it The above estimated range of\naverage generation cots suggest that geothermal power and utility-scale solar PV\nmay become cost-competitive options (see Figure ) for meeting forecast\nelectricity demand in Armenia The Government\u2019 renewable energy strategy is\ndriven by the overarching goals of improving energy security, ensuring tariff\naffordability, and maximizing the use of Armenia\u2019 indigenous energy resources\n2013 Decree of the President of Armenia approved an \u201cEnergy Security Concept\u201d\nfor the country, which prioritizes the use of renewable energy resources The\nGovernment\u2019 Development Strategy for 2012- 2025 specifically calls for the\ndevelopment of indigenous renewable energy resources Table  shows Government\u2019\ntargets for various renewable energy technologies Excluding output from the\nlarge hydroelectric plants, renewable energy generation represented roughly\npercent of total generation in The Government\u2019 target  is for such generation to\nrepresent 21 percent of total generation by 2020, and 26 percent by Table :\nRenewable Energy Generation Capacity and Production Targets 2020- 20301 Small\nHydro Wind Geothermal PV Total Capacity installed (MW) Generation (GWh) 2020\n2025 2020 2025 377 50 50 40 492 397 100

the\nGlobal Environmental Facility (GEF) and the World Bank Targets have been updated\nin this IP because  number of factors, global and local to Armenia, have changed\nsince the development of the Roadmap There is, for example, more information now\nabout the solar, geothermal, and wind resources in Armenia than there was when\nthe Roadmap was produced Wind resources, in particular, have shown to have lower\ncapacity factors than previously thought, making them more expensive on\nlevelized energy cost (LEC) basis Solar PV has, in contrast become more\nattractive The capital costs of utility-scale solar PV projects have declined\nsubstantially over the past few years, shifting more of the technically viable\nsolar potential toward financial viability As  consequence, Government\u2019\npriorities in the years to come are likely to shift away from wind and toward\nsolar PV  SREP\u2019 Role in Removing the Barriers to Renewable Energy in Armenia\nArmenia faces  number of barriers to the further development of renewable energy\nSREP funding can be instrumental in helping to remove or at least weaken  number\nof these barriers Barriers One of the most significant barriers to renewable\nenergy in Armenia is the high cost of investment relative to the currently low\ncost electricity generation mix in the country Tariffs are low because many of\nthe thermal plants generating electricity are fully depreciated and need only to\nrecover variable costs This will change as new generation plants are brought\nonline and tariffs are raised to reflect their capital costs In the meantime,\nhowever, the low cost of generation makes it difficult for consumers to\nunderstand the need for higher-cost renewable energy generation which will\nsatisfy \u2013at least initially\u2014only  small portion of demand This is  barrier\nExcludes generation from the large hydro cascades  of perception which, as\ndescribed below, Government can overcome with SREP\u2019 assistance There are also\nlegitimate concerns about affordability The global economic crisis increased the\nalready high incidence of poverty in Armenia Between 2008 and 2010, the poverty\nincidence increased from percent to percent of the population, and severe\npoverty grew from percent to percent of the total population Energy poverty\u2014in\nwhich households spend more than 10 percent of their budgets on energy\u2014affects\nnearly 30 percent of Armenian households The poorest quintiles of the population\nallocate  relatively higher share of their budgets to electricity than rural\nhouseholds These households are likely to experience more significant pressures\non their budgets as  result of increased energy tariffs  recent World Bank study\nhas estimated that, when  new thermal plant is built, tariff increases could\nresult in increases in poverty of - percent, depending on the sources of\nfinancing used, the gas price, and the technology (nuclear or gas) built first\nHigher tariffs also have environmental consequences in Armenia The historical\nexperience in Armenia is that poorer, rural households have switched\u2014at least\ntemporarily\u2014to traditional fuels (mostly firewood, collected illegally) when\nelectricity and gas tariffs increase Armenia\u2019 forests shrunk by roughly half\nduring the years of energy crisis, and now the forests cover only roughly 10\npercent of total area of the country Another important barrier is the lack of\nexperience with many renewable energy technologies There is no experience\nbuilding and operating utility scale solar PV or geothermal in the country The\nlack of experience creates, or reinforces several other barriers, namely: ; The\nabsence of regulatory incentives for certain technologies The Law on Energy\nguarantees cost recovery through tariffs, but feed-in tariffs were never set for\nsome renewable energy technologies because of perceptions about cost and the\nabsence of long-term financing opportunities Solar PV, for example, was not\ninitially thought to be commercially viable, and so was not, until recent years,\npriority in Armenia ; Limited capacity for equipment acquisition and\ninstallation Limited experience with certain technologies limits the expansion\nof solar PV and large scale geothermal It also substantially raises the costs of\ndoing first projects in these technologies ;  lack of technical capacity among\nlocal financiers The success of the SHPP program is owed, in part, to the good\nquality of technical assessments completed by local commercial banks in programs\nsupported by the World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n(EBRD) and Germany\u2019 Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) Local commercial banks\ndo not, however, currently have capacity to assess other types of RE projects\nThe poor are defined as those with consumption per adult equivalent below the\nupper general poverty line; the severely poor are defined as those with\nconsumption per adult equivalent below the lower general poverty line The\npoverty line in 2010 was computed using the actual minimum food basket and the\nestimated share of non- food consumption in ;  lack of confidence in certain\ntechnologies The lack of experience with RE technologies makes potential\ndevelopers, property owners and energy users skeptical of these technologies and\nuninclined to take the risk of being the first to use them ; Underdeveloped\nlocal markets for certain technologies The lack of experience in certain\ntechnologies also means that there are no markets for services or expertise\nrequired to develop projects using certain technologies Whereas the technologies\nthemselves are typically imported, project development requires local expertise\nin engineering design, procurement and installation The market for such services\nis extremely thin in Armenia These barriers do not exist for all technologies,\nnor do all of the barriers listed above affect any single technology There is\nsome experience, for example, with small hydro, wind, and biomass SREP\u2019 Role in\nremoving barriers in this identified The Government is asking SREP for support\nin facilitating the scaling-up of  subset Investment Plan The of renewable\nenergy technologies technologies were selected because they met  number of\ncriteria, identified through comprehensive analyses and stakeholder\nconsultations, which aligned well with SREP\u2019 objectives Of these criteria, the\npotential for scale-up of the technology, the cost-effectiveness of the\ntechnology and the immaturity of the market were of key importance The\nGovernment is not asking for support in markets, which are already developed\n(such as small hydro), or technologies, which show limited scale- landfill gas)\nThe Government may seek to promote up potential (such as development of many of\nthese technologies on its own or through financing facilities already provided\nthrough the multilateral development banks (MDBs), but has not requested SREP\nsupport for them SREP support will be critical in reducing the cost of\ntechnologies that lie at the threshold of competing with the expected future\ncost of generation in Armenia As noted above, the next large thermal (gas or\nnuclear) plants to be built in Armenia will be substantially higher cost than\ncurrent generating costs SREP funding can help overcome the perception that\nhigh-cost renewable energy technologies are an unnecessary expense, as well as\nconcerns about affordability For technologies, such as geothermal power and\nutility-scale solar PV, the initial projects will help to reduce resource and\nperformance risks, develop local markets and expertise, and provide Government\nthe impetus and opportunity to put in place reforms\u2014in particular appropriate\ntariffs\u2014to support their development As experience with the new RE technologies\nincreases in Armenia, project development costs can be expected to decline, and\nfor some technologies, such as solar PV, local production may also emerge The\neventual development of service providers and, possibly, manufacturers of RE\ntechnologies will have obvious follow-on benefits for Armenia\u2019 economy as  whole\nFinally, SREP support will be critical in creating  demonstration effect for\ntechnologies that are relatively unknown in Armenia, and in funding directly\u2014or\nby attracting other donor funding for\u2014capacity building  The Proposed Investment\nProgram for Armenia  The Government of Armenia, led by the Ministry of Energy\nand Natural Resources (MENR) and supported by the MDBs, has identified two areas\nfor strategic investment that would lead to scale-up The areas were identified\nthrough comprehensive analysis of RE technologies and  participatory process\ninvolving  wide range of government agencies, non-governmental organizations,\nacademic institutions, and the private sector The participatory process included\nmany one-on- one meetings,  workshop with the Government\u2019 SREP working group, as\nwell as an open forum The technologies identified Each of the potential\nrenewable energy resources were evaluated against five criteria, and prioritized\naccordingly The five criteria reflect the Government\u2019 strategic objectives, and\nthe clear recognition that SREP funding should be used to overcome barriers to\ntechnologies that will have the potential to have  transformative impact on the\nenergy sector The criteria considered were: cost- effectiveness of the\ntechnology, the potential for scaling up the technology, the maturity of the\nmarket, the potential for job creation, and the effect of each technology on the\nstability of the grid Two investment priorities emerged from the analyses and\nthe discussions with stakeholders These are as follows:  Geothermal Power\nDevelopment SREP resources would be used for further exploration of Armenia\u2019\nmost promising Karkar geothermal site (in the South- East), thereby, attempting\nto demonstrate the viability of geothermal energy in Armenia if the exploratory\ndrilling at Karkar confirms availability and quality of resource for power\ngeneration Of the known potential geothermal sites in Armenia, the Karkar site\nhas been the most comprehensively assessed through surface studies and was\nassessed to be the highest-potential site to date, with possible output\nestimated at around MW Exploratory drilling is required to confirm the\navailability and quality of the resource for power generation By using SREP\ngrant funding for drilling, the Government can help reduce the risk of\ndeveloping the site If  geothermal resource exists at the site, this support can\nhelp make geothermal power  financially attractive investment for private\ninvestors and an affordable source of electricity This support will serve to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of geothermal power in Armenia and can catalyze\ndevelopment of the other perspective geothermal sites  Development of Utility-\nScale Solar PV SREP resources would be used to develop roughly  MW of utility-\nscale solar PV The rapid decline in solar PV costs in recent years has made\nutility-scale solar PV more competitive with the other power generation options\navailable to Armenia Therefore, it is strategically  The exact commercial\narrangement will need to be developed through further consultation within\ngovernment, with donor partners, and with potential investors However, the\narrangement currently envisaged would involve  private operator having  BOT or\nBOO agreement under which they finance, build and operate the power plants and\nhave  power purchase agreement with the transmission company, HVEN Government\nwould own the steam fields, thereby taking risk on the resource availability The\nSREP funding would be used to hire  transaction advisor to help structure,\ntender, and negotiate the BOT/BOO  beneficial for Armenia to develop its\ncapacity to scale-up this technology SREP support would help catalyze private\ninvestment in first new plants, and show the potential for deploying solar PV on\ncommercial basis  utility-scale commercial project would not only enable the\ncountry to take advantage of this technology in the future when its costs\ndecline even further, but reduce costs for future projects because of learning\neffects Therefore, SREP support is sought to allow the Government to develop\nsolar projects The grant would be used for feasibility studies, including site\nmeasurements and monitoring, and to develop projects itself Initial studies\nindicate that the areas in the vicinity of Lake Sevan have some of the highest\nsolar irradiance in Armenia, and would be considered as  first potential area\nfor development, but more site-specific analyses will be needed to identify\nspecific projects Additional donor financing will be sought to complement the\nSREP contribution, as well as private sector equity and commercial debt SREP\nfinancing would be used in much the same way that MDB funds were used to\nsuccessfully jump-start the small hydropower industry in Armenia nearly  decade\nago The expectation is that, as with small hydropower, once the domestic\ncapacity to deploy solar PV is developed and the financial market is comfortable\nwith the technology, the market will take off The SREP contribution and donor\nfinancing will also be essential to softening the effect on tariffs of the first\nsolar plants Table  presents  plan for financing the projects described in\nSection  It shows the proposed contributions or grants from SREP as well as\nestimates of the amounts anticipated from MDBs and the private sector As the\ntable shows, roughly US$40 million of SREP funding is expected to catalyze\nnearly four times as much investment, most of it from the private sector (as\nequity or debt), and the commercial lending windows of the MDBs  Table :\nFinancing Plan SREP Project Geothermal Development Project

some geo-technical information was available\nThe potential can be significantly larger given several other potential sites,\nwhich have not been explored at all  Solar PV and CSP were evaluated as options\nfor development in the same areas Therefore, the total resource potential\nincludes only the generating potential for one of these technologies (Solar PV)\nFor this reason, the total is not the same as the sum of the resource potential\nlisted for each technology Not all of this technical potential will be\nultimately commercially viable As noted above, the cost of generation in Armenia\nis likely to increase substantially as new thermal or nuclear generation is\nbrought on line and older thermal plants are retired Figure  shows  supply curve\nof the cost of renewable power resources in Armenia assuming concessional,\ncommercial and mixed financing assumptions By way of reference, Armenia\u2019 average\ncost of generation is expected to range from  USD$08/kWh \u2013 US$19/kWh when  new\nnuclear plant is put into service in Solar is not yet cost competitive under\npurely commercial financing assumptions, but the combination of several factors\ncould make it more so in the near future The factors include: () new, higher-\ncost thermal plants being built to serve demand in Armenia; (ii) lower solar\ninstallation costs that will result as  domestic industry develops around it;\n(iii) lower financing costs as lenders become more comfortable with the\ntechnology, and (iv) potential further reductions in the global costs of PV\npanels SREP support can help Armenia nurture its solar industry so that, as\nthese factors converge, Armenia can look to utility-scale solar as  commercially\nviable alternative to some thermal power generation Figure : Renewable

poverty affects almost 30 percent of Armenian\nhouseholds Energy poverty refers to households spending more than 10 percent of\ntheir budgets on energy Armenia\u2019 targeted social assistance program, known as\nthe Poverty Family Benefit Program (PFBP), helps to reduce poverty among\nvulnerable households Government has also used the PFBP in conjunction with\nother measures, to help alleviate energy poverty Beginning in 2011,  lifeline\ntariff for natural gas consumption was introduced for PFBP beneficiaries11\nEnergy Sector Legal, Regulatory and Institutional Framework The

stated\nobjectives in the sector These documents include: () Energy Sector Development\nStrategy within the Context of the Economic Development in Armenia, approved by\nthe GoA in 2005, (ii) the National Program on Energy Saving and Renewable\nEnergy, approved in 2007, and (iii) the Action Plan of the MENR of the Republic\nof Armenia in line with the National Security Strategy, approved in  The History\nof Sector Reforms Armenia\u2019 energy sector has made significant progress in the\nlast two decades The sector has moved from severe crisis\u2014characterized by\ncrippling supply shortages, and near-financial bankruptcy of the sector\u2014to\nstability more characteristic of developed countries than emerging markets In\n1992, customers had only - hours of electricity supply per day; most households\ndepended on firewood or electricity for heating Fiscal and quasi-fiscal\nsubsidies for the energy sector were  major drain on the state\u2014about 11 percent\nof gross domestic product (GDP) Collections were around 50 percent, and nearly\n25 percent of all power produced disappeared before the meters as commercial\nlosses (mostly electricity theft) Since 1996, 24-hour electricity service has\nbeen restored and gradually customers have switched to cheaper, more efficient\ngas heating Meanwhile, tariff increases and operating efficiency improvements\nhave helped create commercially viable service providers, technical and non-\ntechnical losses have decreased, and collections have increased Now the energy\nsector is one of the largest taxpayers in Armenia Supply security has also\nimproved with new regional gas and electricity interconnections, thermal plant\nconstruction and rehabilitation, and growth in renewable energy generating\ncapacity (primarily small hydro)  series of ambitious reforms made this\ntransition possible The principal reforms were: ; Unbundling and privatization\nof the power sector By March 1995, efforts began on unbundling the power system\nand privatizing the power sector; Armenergo, the state-owned vertically\nintegrated utility, was separated into generation and distribution entities In\nMarch 1997,  Presidential Order and new Energy Law formalized separate\ngeneration, distribution, transmission and dispatch During , ownership of\nseveral major generating plants was transferred from the Government in exchange\nfor US$96 million in state debt forgiveness 13 ; Establishment of  sector\nRegulator  Presidential Order and the Energy Law enacted in 1997 established an\nindependent energy sector regulator, the Armenian Energy Regulatory Commission\n(AERC) The Law on the Regulatory Body for Public Services, enacted in 2004,\nchanged the name of the regulator to the Public Services Regulatory Commission\n(PSRC) and expanded its authority including water, drainage and sewage,\ntelecommunications, and rail transport to other sectors, ; Supporting financial\nsustainability Three steps were essential to increase collections, reduce\ncommercial losses and improve the overall financial sustainability of the sector\nThese included: \u2013 Installing meters Between 1997 and 1998, twelve thousand new\ntamper- proof meters were installed throughout the power system at  variety of\nvoltage levels down to  kV Residential customer meters were relocated to public\nareas An Automated Metering and Data Acquisition System (AMDAS) was installed in\n2001 and linked to  settlement center to facilitate accurate meter reading at\nthe 110 kV and above \u2013 Bringing tariffs to cost recovery levels In 1994, Armenia\nbegan  gradual transition to cost-based tariffs by bring household tariffs to\nthe average level of other retail tariffs  schedule was established for further\nhousehold tariff hikes Since 1999, household tariffs have generally remained\nwell above the overall average tariff \u2013 Increasing transparency in collections\nand billing The Electricity Distribution Company (EDC) installed  computerized\ncustomer information system to better track utilization and billing In 1999, the\nEDC established  new collection scheme requiring bill payments at post offices\ninstead of cash payments at local EDC offices, which reduced opportunities for\ncollusion between customers and EDC inspectors The use and development of\nrenewable energy has also been an important part of the transition from crisis\nto stability In 2007, the PSRC set renewable energy feed-in tariffs to stimulate\nprivate investment in renewable energy The feed-in tariff, and MDB financing\nthrough local banks, helped to jump-start  previously non-existent small\nhydropower industry The framework for renewable energy feed-in tariffs is\ndescribed in more detail in Section  In 2004, Government passed the Law on\nEnergy Saving and Renewable Energy This is the main legal act on renewable\nenergy in Armenia Its main objectives were to: ; Strengthen the economic and\nenergy independence and security of Armenia ; Increase the reliability of energy\nsystems in Armenia ; Establish and develop industrial infrastructure and service\norganizations for promoting energy saving and RE ; Reduce adverse impacts on the\nenvironment and human health as  result of technological developments The Law\nalso provided for the establishment of the R2E2 Fund The R2E2 Fund was formed in\nThe role of the R2E2 Fund is discussed in more detail in Section  14\nInstitutional Framework in the Energy Sector The MENR and the PSRC are the key\nentities regulating the energy sector The MENR is responsible for developing\nprimary legislation and main policy documents guiding energy sector activities,\nincluding system planning and investment planning for state-owned entities The\nMinistry of Finance approves allocation of financing for public and publicly-\nguaranteed energy sector investments recommended by the MENR The PSRC regulates\nthe water, electricity and natural gas sectors, and as part of its\nresponsibilities, sets both end-user and supply-side power sector tariffs The\nPSRC allows for recovery of power system investment costs through the tariff The\nelectricity sector consists of nine publicly and privately-owned generation\ncompanies, one state-owned transmission company, one privately-owned\ndistribution company,  state-owned system operator and  state-owned settlement\ncenter The gas sector remains vertically integrated ArmRusGazprom, the gas\ncompany fully owned by the Russia\u2019 Gazprom, imports gas from Russia and Iran,\nand owns and operates the gas transmission and distribution networks in Armenia\nFigure  shows the structure of the electricity sector in Armenia Figure\nStructure of the Electricity Sector of Armenia Armenia\u2019 market

delivery\nbetween all sector entities The System Operator dispatches generators taking\ninto account the economic dispatch order of plants as well as plants\u2019\noperational constraints In the renewable energy sector, the R2E2 Fund plays\ncritical role The R2E2 Fund is an independent organization which facilitates\ninvestments in renewable energy by sponsoring renewable energy studies and\nprojects, and supporting local renewable 15 the project implemented energy\ncompanies and stakeholders Among numerous other projects, the R2E2 Fund in\nArmenia, comprehensive surface exploration at the Karkar geothermal site, as\nwell as the assessment of hydropower resource potential and the evaluation of\nthe potential for solar PV manufacturing and bioethanol production in Armenia,\nand some other renewable energy related studies for development of SHPPs Energy\nSupply and Demand  Armenia relies on electricity and gas to meet the majority of\nits energy consumption needs The industrial, residential and transport sectors\naccount for 85 percent of final energy consumption in Armenia12 Industry relies\non  combination of electricity and gas to meet its energy needs Residential\nhouseholds rely on  mix of electricity and gas for heating, cooking and hot\nwater and electricity for lighting and other household appliance The transport\nsector relies on oil and gas with 75 percent of the automobile and truck fleet\nusing compressed natural gas (CNG) The following subsections describe energy\nconsumption in Armenia in further detail Sections  and  describe the

households, has fallen into\ndisrepair Many heat supply companies went bankrupt and closed following the\neconomic and energy blockade that occurred during the early 1990s As  result,\nmany households switched to individual heating solutions using electricity and,\nmore recently, natural gas In , the share of natural gas in the heating fuel mix\nhas increased from 10 percent to 70 percent, displacing firewood, electricity\nand other fuels, thanks to  rehabilitation and extension of the gas distribution\nnetwork  Electricity Armenia\u2019 electricity system has ,319 MW of installed\ncapacity, and ,530 MW of available generating capacity Electricity is produced\nby three generation sources: nuclear (roughly 30 percent), thermal (roughly 30\npercent), and hydropower (nearly 40 percent) Available capacity is low compared\nto installed capacity because due to the age and poor condition of many\ngenerating plants, significant share of installed generating capacity is non-\noperational Roughly 50 percent of available capacity is more than 40 years old17\nMany of the largest generating assets will need to be retired soon The\nGovernment has already discontinued operation of old and inefficient units at\nYerevan TPP and plans to retire the old units at the Hrazdan TPP by The nuclear\nplant is scheduled to remain online until 2026 because of  lack of alternatives,\nalthough it will require approximately US$300 million of investments to continue\nfunctioning The share of thermal and hydropower plants in the capacity and\nproduction mix has increased in recent years because new plants have been built\nand Armenia has experienced good hydrological conditions over the past several\nyears The NPP provides baseload capacity Other HPPs, including the Vorotan\nCascade and several HPPs in the Sevan-Hrazdan Cascade, provide daily load\nregulation, while thermal plants operate to meet shoulder peak especially in the\nwinter and to serve baseload for several weeks in autumn when the NPP goes\noffline for maintenance The Hrazdan- and Yerevan CCGT plants also generate\nelectricity for export under the gas for electricity swap arrangement with Iran\nDemand grew steadily over the past decade, but dropped in 2008 as  result of the\nglobal financial crisis Electricity consumption in Armenia grew  percent\nannually from 2004\u20132008, but consumption fell  percent in 2009 as  result of the\nfinancial crisis Consumption has since increased, growing  percent and  percent\nin 2012 and 2013, respectively18 Figure  shows

Renewable Energy Sector Context  Armenia has significant indigenous\nrenewable energy resources, and an educated workforce with extensive scientific\nand engineering expertise Furthermore, the Government has taken proactive steps\nin recent years to craft laws and regulations designed to reform the power\nsector to enable private sector involvement in renewable energy technology\ndevelopment However, Armenia\u2019 renewable energy sector faces  number of important\nbarriers to renewable energy deployment, primarily related to the availability\nof financing, the regulatory framework for renewable energy, the high cost of\nrenewable energy technologies and public awareness of the potential benefits of\nrenewable energy technologies This section describes Armenia\u2019 renewable energy\nsector, and includes an assessment of the potential for different renewable\nenergy options,  description of Armenia\u2019 business environment for renewable\nenergy, as well as  description of the barriers facing renewable energy\ndevelopment in Armenia  Analysis of Renewable Energy Options An assessment of\navailable data on renewable energy resources in Armenia was carried out to\nsupport the preparation of the IP This section details the results of that\nassessment and describes progress to date on deploying renewable energy\ntechnologies in Armenia Table  shows the total estimated technical potential for\nrenewable energy in Armenia Table : Renewable Energy Resource Potential in\nArmenia by Technology Technology Capacity (MW) Generation (GWh/yr) Wind

resource potential depends on\nwhich solar PV technology is deployed: Fixed PV, Single-Axis Tracking PV or\nConcentrating PV 22  Assumes flash technology is used The actual capacity cannot\nbe known without exploratory drilling The geothermal capacity estimates are\nbased on results of estimates for three potential sites, for which some geo-\ntechnical information was available The potential can be significantly larger\ngiven several other potential sites, which have not been explored at all  Solar\nPV and CSP were evaluated as options for development in the same areas\nTherefore, the total resource potential includes only the generating potential\nfor one of these technologies (Solar PV) For this reason, the total is not the\nsame as the sum of the resource potential listed for each technology  Small\nHydropower Small hydropower is the most widespread renewable energy technology\ndeployed to date in Armenia except for large hydropower Small hydropower\ncontributes approximately  percent of Armenia\u2019 annual electricity generation As\nof April 2013, Armenia had 136 small hydropower plants (small HPPs) with  total\ncapacity of 221 MW and annual generation of 665 GWh Roughly 60 percent of this\ncapacity has been added since Additionally, the PSRC has licensed the\nconstruction of 77 new projects, which could potentially add approximately 168\nMW of small HPP capacity and 592 GWh of annual generation19 Over 90 MW of\nundeveloped small hydropower projects with  potential for generating almost 300\nGWh have been identified throughout Armenia in addition to the operating and\nlicensed projects  Wind Armenia has  number of areas with promising wind\nresources The most promising areas that have been identified and characterized\nto date are Zod Pass, Karakach Pass, Pushkin Pass, Sisian Pass and the Fontan\nregion Together these sites are estimated to have 150 MW of developable resource\npotential, with estimated capacity factors ranging from 21 to 31 percent,\ndepending on the site20 The private companies Zodwind and Arenergy have\ncompleted feasibility studies for wind plants in Armenia Two other private\ncompanies, SolarEn and MVV-Decon, have conducted wind measurement projects\nHowever, to date no private companies has moved forward with wind plant\ndevelopment in Armenia Armenia\u2019 only operating wind project is the 64 MW Lori\nplant Lori- was built in in December 2005 under  grant from Iran The plant has\ncapacity factor of approximately 11 percent and generates  GWh per year21\nGeothermal Power Armenia has no installed geothermal power plants, but\ncomprehensive geo-technical studies suggest that geothermal resources suitable\nfor power production may exist at  number of sites, including the most promising\nKarkar, Jermaghbyur, and Grizor 19 Public Services Regulatory Commission of\nArmenia, \u201cConstruction of small hydro companies operating indicators\u201d and \u201cMain\nIndicators of Producing small

Potential and Development\nPerspectives,\u201d March 2010 23 confirmed sites, as well as along the Armenian-\nGeorgian border In , comprehensive surface investigation works were conducted\nfor Karkar site, including field scouting, magneto-telluric sounding (MT),\nindependent interpretation of MT results, three- dimensional (3D) MT sounding,\nindependent interpretation of the results of 3D MT sounding as well as early-\nstage economic and financial appraisal Evidence from these activities indicates\nthat  geothermal resource exists at the site, and can only be conclusions and\nrecommendations of those studies were also reviewed by  third party \u2013 Iceland\nGeosurvey (ISOR), which confirmed the robustness of the methodology for the\nabove studies and the key conclusion that exploratory drilling is needed to\nconfirm the resource and its characteristics The World Bank/ESMAP Global\nGeothermal Development Plan TA Program supported the Government to prepare\ndrilling program for Karkar site, including test well options, drilling and\nassociated consulting services required, contracting arrangements, and costs\nthrough exploratory drilling The key The Total geothermal resource potential of\nthree geothermal sites that were explored to some extend has been estimated to\nbe at least 150 MW However, it is important to note that because of the limited\nexploratory activities and information about Armenia\u2019 geothermal resources, this\nis  very rough estimate, which relates only to three potential sites for which\ninformation was available, and the actual geothermal resource potential could be\nmuch larger  Solar PV Armenia has good solar PV resources, with annual average\nglobal horizontal irradiation (GHI) ranging from ,490 kWh/m2 to over ,100 kWh/m2\nBy comparison, average annual GHI in Europe is ,000 kWh/ The total resource\npotential for utility-scale solar PV is over ,500 MW Assuming polycrystalline\nsolar PV modules mounted at  fixed angle to the sun are deployed in ground-\nmounted utility-scale plants, solar PV systems could achieve capacity factors of\n20 to 24 in Armenia (dependent on location) If single-axis tracking solar PV\ntechnology is deployed, capacity factors could be as high as 30 percent In\naddition to utility-scale solar PV, distributed solar PV mounted on building\nrooftops could also be deployed throughout Armenia, although these plants would\nlikely have higher costs and lower capacity factors than large-scale, ground-\nmounted plants Solar PV deployment in Armenia to date has been limited to\nrelatively small-scale rooftop-based installations at schools, hospitals, office\nbuildings and municipal sites throughout Armenia22 It is estimated that less\nthan 100 kW of solar PV is currently operational23 22 USAAA/US\nEmbassy/EcoTeam/UNDP/GEF, \u201cUse of Renewable Energy Sources in the World and\nArmenia Through Innovations to Clear Technologies,\u201d 2010 23 Preparation of\nRenewable Energy Development Roadmap for the Republic of Armenia Task  Report,\u201d\nFebruary 2011 24  Concentrating Solar PV and Concentrating Solar Thermal Power\nAlthough Armenia has good resources for solar PV, Armenia receives relatively\nlow direct normal locations where irradiation (DNI) compared to most of the\nconcentrating solar thermal power (CSP) is successfully deployed24 Armenia\u2019\nannual DNI ranges from ,410 kWh/m2 to ,453 kWh/m2 The minimum DNI level\nthreshold for viability for CSP plants that is generally accepted in the\nindustry is ,200 kWh/m2 Only one area in the South-Eastern corner of Lake Sevan\nreceives DNI above this threshold However, overall Armenia has rather poor\nresources for CSP and for this reason this technology is not considered  viable\noption for development Concentrating solar PV (CPV) also does not appear to be\nfavorable technology option in Armenia compared with the other available solar\nPV technologies Like CSP, CPV also takes advantage of DNI resources An analysis\nof the theoretical performance of CPV plants deployed in Armenia revealed that\nCPV is expected to have lower capacity factors than flat-plate solar PV\ninstallations (fixed axis or single- axis tracking), and CPV is also expected to\nhave higher capital costs than these technologies  Biomass Armenia\u2019 biomass\nresources that could potentially be used for power generation consist of\nforestry residues (fallen wood and sanitary cuttings) and crop residues from\ngrain farming Dedicated energy crops have also been considered as  potential\nbiomass resource in Armenia, but preliminary estimates suggest that cultivating\ncrops for fuel would be very high-cost The biomass resource assessment suggests\nthat there are sufficient forestry residues to support   MW power plant in\nArmenia and sufficient grain crop residues to support  25 MW power plant\nHowever, it would be necessary to transport forestry and crop from all around\nthe country to central locations and there is currently no established\ninfrastructure to do this Therefore, it is expected that it would be\nlogistically difficult to collect biomass resources for power generation, and\nthat the collection costs from transporting the fuel would make fuel costs very\nhigh  Biogas Armenia has the potential for biogas-based power production at\nlivestock farms, at the Nubarashen landfill (in the city of Yerevan) and at the\nAeratsia wastewater treatment plant (in the city of Yerevan) In 2010, the\nGEF/UNDP identified three livestock farms as potential candidates for biogas-to-\nenergy projects, with  24 Direct Normal Insolation (DNI) is energy that travels\ndirectly from the sun without interruption Rays of direct insolation are\nparallel, and concentrating solar collectors (both concentrating PV and\nconcentrating solar power) collect the parallel rays onto  receiver Solar energy\nwhich is not direct is called diffuse insolation, and it is carried by rays\nwhich have been scattered or reflected Concentrating solar collectors are unable\nto collect these oblique rays of diffuse insolation, but flat plate collectors\n(solar PV) can absorb both DNI and diffuse insolation and convert them to usable\nenergy The DNI is relatively low in Armenia compared to other parts of the world\nwhere concentrating solar is being deployed This means that in Armenia more of\nthe energy of the sun is scattered by clouds or haze before it can hit  solar\ncollector Additionally, Armenia\u2019 latitude causes the sun to stay lower in the\nsky than in other parts of the world The lower sun means that the direct\ninsolation must pass through more atmosphere and so the energy is \u2019diluted\u2019 by\nstriking the solar collector at an angle 25 combined resource potential of  MW\nThese plants would be similar to the Lusakert biogas plant, which is Armenia\u2019\nonly operating industrial-scale biogas-to- energy plant, located at the Lusakert\npoultry farm In 2001,  consortium of Japanese companies began studying the\npotential for  landfill gas-to-energy plant at the Nubarashen landfill Although\neventually the consortium installed  methane gas flare plant instead of an\nenergy project, more recent assessments have identified the potential for\nbuilding up to   MW landfill gas-to-energy plant at the facility The other\npotential source of biogas energy in Armenia is the Aeratsia wastewater\ntreatment plant The plant is currently dilapidated and largely non-functioning,\nbut if the plant were to undergo significant rehabilitation and anaerobic\ndigesters are installed at the facility, it is expected that   MW cogeneration\nplant could be constructed at the facility  Geothermal Heating/Cooling\nTechnologies Armenia has significant potential for geothermal heating and\ncooling in residential buildings If land is available, geothermal heat pumps\ncould theoretically be deployed anywhere and could cover  large portion of\nArmenia\u2019 space heating and cooling load Furthermore, Armenia is estimated to\nhave high quality geothermal resources The coefficient of

implemented in Armenia In 2009, an 860 kW geothermal heat pump was\ninstalled at  commercial building in Northern Avenue in Yerevan  Solar Thermal\nHeating Technologies There is significant potential for solar thermal hot water\nheating technologies in Armenia This technology has been deployed in  number of\ndemonstrations over the past decade, but the total penetration is small (less\nthan  MW of total installed capacity) and the technology has yet to gain\nwidespread commercial acceptance26 Recent solar thermal heating projects in\nArmenia include the implementation of GEF-funded systems at  housing development\nand  school in the Shirak region27  Costs of Renewable Energy The comparative\ncost of renewable energy technologies is an important factor when determining\ntheir viability and attractiveness for inclusion in Armenia\u2019 energy portfolio\nThis section presents supply curves that show the levelized energy costs 25 The\ncoefficient of performance is the ratio of the amount of energy recovered from\ngeothermal heating system to the amount of energy input to the system to operate\nit  higher coefficient of performance means that  geothermal system more\nefficiently transfers heat from the ground to an indoor space 26 USAAA/US\nEmbassy/EcoTeam/UNDP/GEF, \u201cUse of Renewable Energy Sources in the World and\nArmenia Through Innovations to Clear

several\nuncertainties associated with the data presented in the figures The geothermal\nenergy resource potential shown in this supply curve has not yet been proven to\nexist, and the size of the

country\u2019 significant\nrenewable energy resource potential and history of past success in the\ndevelopment of  robust domestic hydropower industry Table  describes some of the\nmost significant barriers hindering the 31 development of renewable energy in\nArmenia For each barrier, there is also  corresponding discussion of possible\nmitigation options 32 Table  Barriers to Renewable Energy Development and\nMitigation Options Barrier Mitigation Options Costs High costs of the first\nutility-scale solar and geothermal projects in the-country will likely not be\ncost-competitive with conventional energy generating technologies and Armenia\u2019\ncurrent power generation mix Therefore, the implementation of renewable energy\ntechnologies can make energy unaffordable for consumers in this environment if\nthe full cost of these technologies is passed on to consumers Support the\nArmenian renewable energy industry for  short period of time with funding and\nlow-cost financing to help the domestic industry gain experience with these\ntechnologies and thereby drive their costs down in Armenia in the long-term\nLegal and Regulatory Poor coordination between authorities makes

construction timeframe and disincentivize the development of small\nprojects Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) are not issued until construction of\nSHPPs and wind plants are complete PPA terms are limited to 15 years, leaving\ninvestors uncertain about the remaining - years of the plant life in the case of\nwind, 10 years in the case of solar, and 15 years in the case of geothermal VAT\nlaws current legislation for wind plants allow payment of VAT to be postponed\nfor  years, but having to pay back VAT  years later is  cash-flow burden for\nrenewable energy projects, relatively early in the life of the project There is\ncurrently no mechanism to guarantee remuneration for solar PV or geothermal\nprojects ; Move issuance of PPAs to the time that the development permit is\ngranted

strategy is driven by the overarching goals of improving energy\nsecurity, ensuring affordable energy supply, and maximizing the use of Armenia\u2019\nindigenous energy resources As described in Section , several key strategic\ndocuments\u2014the 2013 National Energy Security Concept, the Armenian Development\nStrategy, and the National Security Strategy\u2014specifically call for the\ndevelopment of indigenous renewable energy resources In the past few years the\nGovernment has acted on its commitment to deploy renewable energy technologies\nby implementing the Feed-In Tariff for certain technologies: wind, biomass, and\nhydropower The Government has also undertaken regulatory reforms and amendments\nto tax laws that have streamlined the renewable energy project development\nprocess For instance, in recognition of the fact that Water Use Permits and PSRC\noperating licenses had different durations and this was causing uncertainty\namong developers,  process has been created to obtain  Water Use Permit with the\nsame duration as the PSRC permit30 The Government also enables wind energy\ndevelopers to postpone VAT payments for imported equipment for three years31\nTable  shows Government\u2019 targets for various renewable energy technologies\nExcluding output from the large hydroelectric plants, renewable energy\ngeneration represented roughly  percent of total generation in Government\u2019\ntarget is for such generation to represent 21 percent of total generation by\n2020, and 26 percent by Table : Renewable Energy Generation Capacity

the\nWorld Bank Targets have been updated in this IP because  number of factors,\nglobal and local to Armenia, have changed since the 30 USAID, \u201cSmall Hydropower\nSector Framework, Status, Development Barriers and Future Development 2012\nUpdate,\u201d March 2012 31 USAID, \u201cWind Energy Development in Armenia: Legal,\nRegulatory, Tax and Customs Regulations,\u201d April 2010 32 Excludes generation from\nthe large hydro cascades 37 development of the Roadmap There is, for example,\nmore information now about the solar, geothermal, and wind resources in Armenia\nthan there was when the Roadmap was produced Wind resources, in particular, have\nshown to have lower capacity factors the previously thought, making them more\nexpensive on  levelized energy cost (LEC) basis Solar PV has, in contrast become\nmore attractive The capital costs of utility-scale solar PV projects have\ndeclined substantially over the past few years, shifting more of the technically\nviable solar potential toward financial viability As  consequence, Government\u2019\npriorities in the years to come are likely to shift away from wind and toward\nsolar PV  Role of the Private Sector Armenia has been successful in attracting\nsubstantial private sector participation in the renewable energy sector For\nrenewable energy projects, this participation has primarily been through small\nhydropower projects However, there are also  number of private companies that\nmanufacture and install solar thermal heaters, geothermal heating and cooling\nequipment and distributed solar PV in Armenia There are also several examples of\nsuccessful private sector participation in non- hydropower renewable energy\nprojects The Lusakert biogas plant was developed by  consortium of\norganizations, some of which were private Armenian companies The methane capture\nand flare gas plant at the Nubarashen landfill was funded by foreign donors, but\nit is currently operated by an Armenian company  number of small solar thermal\nhot water and solar PV projects have been developed by private companies in\nArmenia over the years Recently,  private company developed an 860 kW geothermal\nheat pump system in  large commercial building on Northern Avenue in Yerevan\nnumber of commercial banks support renewable energy projects in Armenia by\nproviding loans to project developers As mentioned above, the lack of long-term\nfinancing at attractive interest rates is one major barrier to the development\nof privately-owned renewable energy projects in Armenia and the expansion of\nexisting financing programs for renewable energy would encourage growth in the\nsector  On-going and Planned Investments by Development Partners Several\nmultilateral and bilateral donors are actively in promoting renewable energy in\nArmenia The following subsections describe these donors and their areas of\ninvolvement involved European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)\nEBRD is actively involved in Armenia\u2019 energy sector promoting energy efficiency\nand renewable energy Current and recent activities include: ; Rehabilitation of\nSevan-Hrazdan HPP EBRD is co-financing the rehabilitation of the Sevan-Hrazdan\ncascade with ADB\u2019 PSOD ; Development of small hydropower plants (HPPs) EBRD\nprovided US$ million to Cascade Bank (now America Bank) for on-lending to\nArmenian companies developing SHPPs under the Renewable Energy Project These\nfunds, combined with  World Bank loan of US$ million, US$ million equity\ninvestment from  private investor, and US$13 million co-financing from project\ndevelopers, which 38 enabled to develop 25 SHPPs with total installed capacity\nof 45 MW33 The Renewable Energy Project included also US$ million GEF grant to\nhelp create enabling environment for development of renewable energy\nSpecifically, the GEF grant helped to: () improve the regulatory environment for\nrenewables; () develop and adopt technical standards for renewable energy and\nregulations for dispatching and load-regulation of grid-connected renewable\nenergy plants; and () remove information barriers to investments in renewable\nenergy, including creation of GIS database of RE resources, SHPP scheme,\nfeasibility studies and resource assessments ( competitive advantage of Armenia\nin solar PV value chain, assessment of technical and economic viability of\nbiofuels, etc), ; Regulatory support to promote renewable energy EBRD provided\ntechnical support to the PSRC on feed-in tariffs (FiT) and third party access\n(TPA) regulations KfW KfW\u2019 engagement in Armenia\u2019 energy sector currently\nfocuses on developing and maintaining renewable energy resources and financing\ntransmission investments to support regional cooperation Specific areas of\nrecent and potential investment in the field of renewable energy include: ;\nConstruction and rehabilitation of SHPPs KfW provides financing and advisory\nsupport for construction and rehabilitation of privately-owned SHPPs Under Phase\n, KfW supported 14 SHPPs through several commercial banks Phase , currently\nunder implementation, is expected to finance up to 20 SHPPs with  total capacity\nof 45 MW Phase , currently in the planning stage, will include up to EUR 40\nmillion in financing and may be expanded to cover financing for wind projects\nWorld Bank/International Finance Corporation (IFC) ; The World Bank Group has\ntwo decades of engagement in supporting power sector reforms and clean energy\ndevelopment in Armenia The World Bank\u2019 and IFC\u2019 recent engagements in Armenia\u2019\nenergy sector have focused on development of renewable energy resources and\npromoting energy efficiency through rehabilitation of transmission\ninfrastructure and, more recently, demand-side efficiency measures As mentioned\nabove, IFC provided US$15 million to Ameriabank CJSC, resulting in the\ndevelopment of 12 SHPPs with over 40 MW capacity More recently, the World Bank\nprovided  US$  million to fund technical field investigation studies for\npotential geothermal sites in Armenia Global Environment Facility (GEF) The GEF\u2019\nSmall Grants Programme (SGP) provided grants for two solar thermal heating\nprojects in the Shirak region of Armenia ; Solar Thermal Heating System in\nHousing Development In 2010, the GEF provided  grant for US$30,970 to complete\nenergy efficiency upgrades and 39 the installation of  solar thermal heating\nsystem at  housing development In the first winter of its implementation the\nproject reduced natural gas consumption by 40 percent ; Solar Thermal Heating\nSystem in  Kindergarten Starting in 2013, the GEF provided  grant for US$33,920\nto develop  multi-purpose solar thermal hot water system to provide heated water\nto  kindergarten As part of the project  solar thermal heating system will be\ninstalled at  greenhouse next to the building The intention is that this project\nwill serve as  demonstration of the potential for using solar thermal\ntechnologies to heat greenhouses 40  Prioritization of Renewable Energy\nTechnologies The Government of Armenia, led by the MENR and supported by the\nMDBs, has identified four areas for strategic investment that would lead to\nscale-up The areas were identified through  participatory process involving\nwide range of government agencies, non-governmental organizations, academic\ninstitutions, and the private sector The participatory process included many\none-on-one meetings,  workshop with the Government\u2019 SREP working group, as well\nas an open forum The subset of \u201ctechnically viable\u201d resources was selected from\nthose described in Section  These were geothermal and solar thermal heating,\nutility-scale solar PV, geothermal power, small HPPs, agricultural biogas,\nlandfill gas, wind and distributed PV These resources were evaluated against\nfive criteria on  scale of  to , with  indicating that the resource met the\ncriteria best of all resources and  indicating that it met the criteria worst of\nall resources The five criteria reflect the Government\u2019 strategic objectives,\nand the clear recognition that SREP funding should be used to have\ntransformative impact on the renewable energy sub-sector The criteria considered\nwere: ; Potential for scale-up of the technology The amount of developable\nresource potential relative to the other technologies, as measured by production\npotential (GWh) Resources with higher production potential were given higher\npriority ; Market maturity/immaturity The extent to which the technology is used\nor the resource is already exploited in Armenia, or there is financing already\navailable from other donor programs Resources or technologies which are already\nwell-known and well-developed in Armenia (such as small hydropower generation),\nwere given lower priority because they already had sufficient support or private\nsector interest Resources or technologies which already have financing available\nthrough other donor programs (such as geothermal heat pumps, solar thermal\nheating and rooftop solar PV) were also given lower priority because there is\nalready financing available through other MDB programs (such as financing\navailable through local banks from EBRD and IFC) ; Cost-effectiveness The cost\nof the electricity or heat generated by the technology, as measured by the\nlevelized energy cost (LEC)34 ; Potential for job-creation The extent to which\nuse of  technology or exploitation of  resource creates jobs ; Effect on power\ngrid stability The extent to which certain technologies had  negative or\npositive impact on system operation and dispatch Technologies with no impact, or\npositive impact on grid stability were prioritized over those with  negative\nimpact 34 The LEC is the present value of capital and operating costs for each\ntechnology, on  kWh basis 41 Table  shows the quantitative rankings assigned to\neach technology under each criterion The rankings were used as  rough guide for\ndiscussion only, using the assumption that each criterion had an equal weight\nUltimately, some of the highest- ranking resources (geothermal heat pumps and\nsolar thermal, for example) were rejected because stakeholders recognized that\nsubstantial financing for such technologies already existed under MDB-financed\nprograms or because (as is the case for SHPPs) substantial private sector\nactivity already exists) Table : Ranking of Renewable Technologies

44 Program Description  The\nprioritization exercise described in Section  has led to the selection of two\nfocus areas: geothermal power and utility-scale solar PV In order to overcome\nexisting barriers to renewable energy deployment and to catalyze future\ninvestment and scale-up of the selected technologies in Armenia, the SREP\ninvestment program is built around the following five objectives:  Provide the\nArmenian renewable energy industry with  \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d during which\nrenewable energy project costs can be reduced through first-projects without\nsignificantly affecting the affordability of energy to consumers This will\nenable future projects to be developed at lower cost without donor support\nBuild capacity among local banks to finance renewable energy technologies and\ndevelop their abilities to do this in the future  Build capacity among local\nindustry to procure, deploy and make equity investments in renewable energy\ntechnologies  Build public confidence in renewable energy technologies to create\nmarket demand  Encourage further reforms among regulatory agencies to support\nrenewable energy scale-up after SREP funding/donor financing is gone This\nsection describes the proposed projects, the transformational impact of each\nproject, the activities envisioned for each, and the expected co-benefits and\nenvironmental and social risks associated with each technology Program Objective\nThe objective of the SREP Armenia IP is to catalyze private investment in\ntechnologies which, for lack of experience, high capital costs and  variety of\nother reasons, have not previously been considered as options in the country\nSREP funds will be used to do first-projects in utility-scale geothermal power\nand utility-scale solar PV In the process of developing these first projects,\nlocal capacity will be built in the financial and project development\ncommunities that will be crucial for the is expended scale-up of these\ntechnologies after SREP and donor funding Furthermore, the demonstration effect\nof these first projects will serve to educate consumers on the benefits of\nrenewable energy technologies SREP support can help to gradually introduce\ngeothermal power and utility-scale solar PV by: () absorbing some of the project\ndevelopment risk on geothermal power, through subsidization of exploratory\nwells, and; (ii) helping the finance the country\u2019 first utility-scale solar PV\nprojects to attract private investors while minimizing the tariff-impact\nExpected Outcomes The main results expected from the SREP Armenia IP are as\nfollows: ; Better security of supply and reliability by increasing the\nproportion of domestic renewable energy in the energy mix 45 ; The creation of\nutility-scale solar sector and geothermal power sector attractive to private\ninvestors ; Develop the first utility-scale solar PV projects, which through\ngradual tariff increases (as the tariff levels in the country gradually increase\nto reflect long- run supply costs) will eventually become commercially viable\nwithout SREP/MDB support These first projects will be so small as to have only\nvery minor impact on the overall cost of generation in Armenia, but could have\ncatalytic effect on the market for solar PV through: \u2013 Lower solar installation\ncosts that will result as  domestic industry develops around it; \u2013 Lower\nfinancing costs as lenders become more comfortable with the technology; and \u2013\nPotential further reductions in the global costs of PV panels The foreseen\nincrease in thermal generation costs in Armenia will move solar toward financial\nviability Armenia\u2019 new thermal plants will require substantially higher tariffs\nthan many of the existing plants, because they are fully (or near fully)\ndepreciated and no longer recover depreciation charges Moreover, existing plants\ndo not require debt service through their generation tariffs, whereas new plants\nwill require such provision ; Contribution to reduction of impending supply\ncapacity gap to meet forecast demand As noted above, Armenia will need roughly\n170 MW of new capacity by 2018 and 830 MW of capacity when the nuclear plant is\nretired in ; Improvement to the enabling environment for renewable energy\ntechnologies The first utility-scale solar PV and geothermal projects will\nprovide an opportunity for PSRC to streamline administrative procedures and\nfiscal policies to encourage investment in  wider range of renewable energy\ntechnologies ; Creation of jobs related to the construction/installation,\noperation and maintenance of renewable technologies Education of the workforce\nin the deployment of these technologies An indication of possible job creation\nin Armenia is provided in Annex  ; Promotion of local & in  technology which has\ntraditionally been  focus of researchers and academicians in Armenia ; Reduced\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as compared to the business-as- usual scenario,\nunder which Armenia will likely continue to expand the use of natural gas for\npower generation and heating The details of the three projects to be carried out\nare described in more detail below  Geothermal Power Exploration and Development\nSREP resources would be used for further exploration of Armenia\u2019 most promising\ngeothermal site - Karkar Prior studies suggest the existence of  geothermal\nresource at the site, but it is necessary to carry out exploratory drilling to\nconfirm the 46 availability and quality of the potential geothermal resource for\npower generation The typical signs of  high temperature geothermal area are not\npresent on the surface, however, the very low resistivity anomaly in the layer\nbetween 500-,000 meters is an indication of  possible high temperature\nhydrothermal alteration The real nature of the resource, whether high, low or\nintermediate temperature and its potential for power generation can only be\nconfirmed through exploratory drillings By using SREP support for this activity,\nthe Government can help reduce the risk of developing the site for the private\nsector If  geothermal resource exists at the site, this support can help make\ngeothermal power  financially attractive investment for private investors and an\naffordable source of electricity for Armenia\u2019 grid The support can also serve to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of geothermal power in Armenia  first successful\nproject can build domestic capacity in the development of additional geothermal\nresources in Armenia at Armenia\u2019 other prospective geothermal sites It will also\nbuild investor confidence that geothermal is  viable and profitable investment\nopportunity in Armenia  Priority activities The geothermal power project would\ninclude the following activities: ; Exploratory Drilling at Karkar Geothermal\nSite This step requires carrying out exploratory drilling at the site to\ndetermine whether or not power could be produced from the resource ; Feasibility\nStudy for Karkar site If the presence of  resource is confirmed,  full\nfeasibility study will need to be prepared to recommend the type of geothermal\ntechnology/plant to be constructed, reassess the economic and financial\nviability, compliance with environmental and social safeguards, and to complete\nlegal and regulatory due diligence The legal and regulatory due diligence will\ninclude recommendations on the need for  feed-in tariff specific to geothermal\nor  recommended structure and method for procuring as  public private\npartnership in  way that determines the tariff through bidding (for example,\nreverse auction) It will also be necessary to evaluate the potential for grid\ninterconnection at the chosen site, and whether or not grid upgrades will be\nnecessary for the potential geothermal power plant to be connected to the grid ;\nTransaction Advisory Services The Government would procure the project as\nPublic Private Partnership (PPP) Therefore, advisory services will be needed to\nhelp structure the PPP (for example, as  Build-Operate-Transfer or Build- Own-\nOperate contract) and procure  private investor and operator The exact\ncommercial arrangement will need to be developed through further consultation\nwithin government, with donor partners, and with potential investors However,\nthe arrangement currently envisaged would involve  private operator having  BOT\nor BOO agreement under which they finance, build and operate the power plant and\nhave  power purchase agreement with the distribution company The Government\nwould own the steam fields, thereby taking risk on the resource availability 47\n; Development of Geothermal Power Plant As noted above, it is expected that the\nprivate sector will make the capital investment required for generation of\nelectricity (the power plant itself) This investment plan assumes  plant with\ninstalled capacity of MW, based on the average size of geothermal plants\nelsewhere The actual size of the plant will depend on the resource potential\nidentified in earlier activities  Parallel activities to be funded by other\nparties It is expected that the World Bank (IBRD), ADB or the commercial lenders\nwithin the MDBs (IFC in the World Bank Group, PSOD at ADB, or EBRD) as well as\nother commercial financial institutions may be able to finance some of the\ncapital costs of the project as  way of making it more attractive to private\ninvestors The Government contributions may include, for example, land or co-\nfinancing of taxes The MDB support may also include concessional lending to the\nGovernment for the transmission lines, or other infrastructure required at the\nsite  Environmental, social and gender co-benefits The development of\ngeothermal power project at the Karkar site in Armenia would have  number of\nenvironmental, social and gender co-benefits These are likely to be somewhat\nsimilar to the co-benefits of most of other renewable power generation\ntechnologies, with some important exceptions For instance, geothermal power\nprovides base load generation, which does not require as much \u201cback up\u201d\ngeneration as variable renewable energy sources The geothermal project is\nexpected to create the following environmental, social and gender co-benefits: ;\nMinimized land-use for energy generation Compared with other renewable energy\ngenerating technologies, such as solar and wind, geothermal power uses\nrelatively small land area ; Reduction of pollutant emissions  geothermal power\nplant has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas as well as local particulate\nmatter emissions from gas-fired power generation in Armenia Although the\nmajority of Armenia\u2019 energy generation is from nuclear and hydropower sources,\nthere is still the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Armenia\u2019\noperating natural gas-fired power plants by offsetting their generation with\nenergy from  geothermal power plant ; Job creation Potential short-term job\ncreation during exploration of the geothermal site Potential for both short and\nlong-term job creation during the development and operations of  geothermal\nplant Given the remote location of the Karkar site, the project could help\nreduce rural unemployment in the surrounding areas ; Targeted job creation for\nwomen Potential for operational agreements for the renewable energy projects to\ntarget the encouragement of jobs for women For example, the concession contract\nwith the private operator could include set-asides for women to make up  certain\npercentage of local staff 48 ; Energy security By replacing existing electricity\ngeneration resources,  large portion of which relies on imported fuel that is\nsubject to price fluctuation, geothermal power could act as  hedge against\nfuture natural gas and uranium price increases This could help minimize the\neffect of these price fluctuations on domestic electricity tariffs and, thereby,\nhelp keep electricity service affordable for all consumers  Environmental and\nsocial risks The development of  utility-scale geothermal project at the Karkar\nsite in Armenia is expected to have relatively limited environmental and social\nrisks, especially compared with conventional and even other renewable energy\ntechnologies However, significant gaps exist in the environmental and social\nrisk analyses that have been conducted to date and the site should be studied in\ngreater detail before the project implementation Having said that,  preliminary\nreview of available data related to the potential site and an analysis of the\ngeneric risks that face this type of project development suggest that the\nproject will have relatively limited negative environmental and social risks The\nimpacts of this project are expected to be akin to those from any other large\ninfrastructure project that takes place in  rural area, although with some\nnotable exceptions Specifically, the geothermal project is expected to face the\nfollowing environmental and social risks: ; Environmental risks \u2013 Land\nsubsidence groundwater) (compaction of rock due to the withdrawal of \u2013 Increased\nmicro-seismic activity near the local area, including increased risk laying of\nlandslides though excavations for geothermal well and of associated\ninfrastructure and transmission networks \u2013 Altered groundwater\nrecharge/extraction regime if groundwater is used for energy generation (such as\nfor steam generation or emissions cleaning) and is not later returned to the\naquifer \u2013 Water use during operations, which causes surface water abstraction,\nrun- in river flows and localized changes leading to off and discharge\nmorphology \u2013 The potential for localized geological damage though excavations\nfor geothermal well and laying of associated infrastructure and transmission\nnetworks \u2013 During the construction stage, the project is expected to produce\nemissions due to material transportation and on-site plant movements ( vehicle\nemissions, particulate matter and dust) \u2013 Construction activities have the\npotential for causing soil erosion and compaction Localized erosion, compaction,\nsalinization, sealing and/or contamination from site alteration and project\nactivities could wash away fines and change the soil' properties Furthermore,\nexcavations for land- grading and foundations could mobilize previously\ncontaminated soils 49 \u2013 Localized land-take from footprint of energy generation\ninfrastructure This could have footprint impacts upon species due to\nconstruction of power plant and related infrastructure \u2013 Transformation of\nlandscape ; Social risks \u2013 Lack of  local workforce with the knowledge and\nskills capable to operate and maintain the plants This might mean that it is\nnecessary to import labor to the region to develop and operate the plant \u2013\nImpacts to traffic patterns during construction and operation (not expected near\nthe site, as there is limited road infrastructure, but rather expected on the\nway to the site)  Utility-Scale Solar PV Project Development SREP resources\nwould be used to finance the development of  MW of utility- scale solar PV The\nrapid decline in solar PV costs in recent years has made utility- scale solar PV\nmore affordable and more competitive with the other power generation options\navailable to Armenia SREP support would help catalyze private investment in\nfirst new plant (or plants), and show the potential for deploying solar PV on\ncommercial basis Given recent trends in solar PV costs, solar PV is expected to\nbecome even more cost-competitive in Armenia and  demonstration project would\nenable the country to take advantage of this technology in the future when it\nbecomes more cost-competitive with other technologies SREP funds would be used\nin much the same way that MDB funds were used to successfully jump-start the\nsmall hydropower industry in Armenia nearly  decade ago  Priority activities The\nutility-scale solar PV project would include the following activities: ; Project\npreparation, feasibility studies, site measurement and monitoring SREP grant\nfunds would first be used to fund more detailed resource assessments, and\nidentification of possible sites and possible projects As described in Section ,\nrelatively coarse resolution solar data are publicly available for Armenia Given\nthe nature of solar energy resources, these coarse data are generally acceptable\nfor understanding the nature of the resource and conducting  high-level\nfinancial analysis However,  feasibility study will be needed to characterize\nthe solar resource potential in the areas targeted for solar development in more\ndetail Furthermore, it will be necessary to evaluate the potential for grid\ninterconnection at the chosen site, and whether or not grid upgrades will be\nnecessary before the project is interconnected As for the geothermal power\nproject, the feasibility study will also reaffirm the economic and financial\nviability, compliance with environmental and social safeguards, and to complete\nlegal and regulatory due diligence ; Transaction advisory Transaction advisors\nwould be hired to help government tender for the projects identified in the\nfeasibility studies Private operators would be procured through competitive\ntender Bidders would be selected based on technical and financial criteria, the\nfinancial criteria being the level of 50 tariff required or, alternatively, the\nlevel of concessional support required35 Developers offering lower tariffs or\nrequiring less concessional support would receive higher scores ; Investment in\nMW project or projects Government would on-lend SREP funds at concessional rates\nto private operators bidding on the projects being tendered The private\noperators would contribute equity and also source loans from commercial banks\nand from the commercial lending arms of the MDBs Government estimates that,\ngiven current capital costs for utility-scale solar PV, SREP funds could be used\nwith these other sources of financing to support roughly  MW of solar As noted\nin Section , initial studies indicate that Gegharkunik Marz has some of the\nhighest solar PV potential in Armenia, and would be considered as  first\npotential area for development This could be  single plant, or several plants\nwith  total capacity of  MW, as development of solar is often more effective if\nthere are multiple sites, in areas with different solar profiles (to provide\nmore stability by diversifying generation profiles)  Parallel activities to be\nfunded by other donors As noted above, it is foreseen that, in addition to SREP\nsupport, the commercial lending arms of the MDBs will be willing to provide co-\nfinancing for the solar projects As for the geothermal power project, Government\ncan also be expected to contribute in ways that reduce the overall capital\nexpenditure required for the project (by providing land, for example or waivers\nof taxes)  Environmental, social and gender co-benefits The development of\nutility-scale solar PV project could have  number of environmental, social and\ngender co-benefits These are likely to be somewhat similar to the co-benefits of\nother renewable power generation technologies The solar PV project is expected\nto create the following social, environmental and gender co-benefits: ;\nReduction of pollutant emissions  solar PV plant has the potential to reduce\ngreenhouse gas as well as local particulate matter emissions from gas-fired\npower generation in Armenia Although the majority of Armenia\u2019 energy generation\nis from nuclear and hydropower sources, there is still the potential to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions from Armenia\u2019 operating natural gas- fired power plants\nby offsetting their generation with energy from  solar PV power plant Solar PV\nplants generate most of their energy during the middle of the day, during some\nof the higher hours of energy consumption in Armenia Solar PV could be used to\noffset the need to dispatch hydropower, saving hydropower generation to serve\npeaks in the mornings and evenings when otherwise more expensive thermal plants\nwould be needed 35 Bidders will be offered, as part of the conditions of tender,\naccess to SREP capital contributions 51 ; Job creation Potential short-term job\ncreation during the development and operations of the plant More importantly,\nthere is considerably research and development (&) and interest in solar PV\nwithin Armenia\u2019 academic institutions  solar PV project could catalyze further\nresearch and development and facilitate the transfer of capacity for\nmanufacturing, installation and operation to the local market ; Targeted job\ncreation for women Potential for operational agreements for the renewable energy\nprojects to target the encouragement of jobs for women ; Energy security By\nreplacing existing electricity generation resources, much of which relies on\nimported fuel that is subject to uncontrollable price fluctuation, solar power\ncould act as  hedge against future natural gas and uranium price increases This\ncould help minimize the effect of these price fluctuations on energy tariffs and\nthereby help keep electricity service affordable for all consumers ; Reduced\nwater resource use Solar PV does not require cooling water, which is required\nfor most combustion-based energy sources including thermal plants Unlike\nhydropower resources, solar PV does not divert or interrupt the flow of natural\nwater courses In general, development of solar PV will result in less\ndisturbance and consumption of Armenia\u2019 water resources than most other energy\ntechnologies currently used in Armenia, and some other renewable energy\ntechnologies  Environmental and social risks The development of  utility-scale\nsolar PV plant in Armenia is expected to have relatively limited environmental\nand social risks, especially compared to conventional power generation\ntechnologies For instance, the utility-scale solar PV projects are expected to\nhave negligible emissions compared with fossil-fuel-based generation However,\nthere are no site-specific feasibility studies or other documents that could\nhave been drawn up on to provide  more detailed description of environmental and\nsocial impacts of potential solar PV project  detailed environmental and social\nimpact assessment, including mitigation measures, will be conducted as part of\nthe preparation of each site-specific project Many of the environmental and\nsocial risks expected to arise from this project are site-specific But, unlike\nthe geothermal project, the site for this project has not yet been chosen The\nfact that large swaths of Armenia\u2019 land have reasonably high- quality solar\nenergy resources suggests that there are many locations where this project could\nbe implemented, and therefore it is expected that at least some of the\nenvironmental and social risks detailed here could be avoided by choosing  site\nwhere these risks would be minimized Based on an analysis of the generic risks\nthat are typically related to this type of projects, the solar PV project is\nexpected to face the following environmental and social risks: ; Environmental\nrisks \u2013 Construction-stage air emissions due to material transportation and on-\nsite plant movements ( vehicle emissions, particulate matter and dust) 52 \u2013\nVegetation clearance during construction and placement of generating equipment\nand ancillary facilities in floodplains could increase catchment flooding\npotential \u2013 Impacts from construction of power transmission lines to evacuate\nelectricity generated by solar PV plants \u2013 Footprint/land-take for solar\ngeneration infrastructure Limited habitat re- growth potential due to presence\nof PVs Fragmentation of ecosystems from footprint, access roads and transmission\nnetworks \u2013 Disturbance of habitat during construction Land-take footprint\nimpacts upon terrestrial species \u2013 Disposal of obsolete solar PV modules upon\ntheir decommissioning is  significant environmental issue, largely due to the\npresence of toxic chemicals in the discarded modules Recycling methods for PV\npanels are in place within the industry and further developments are planned for\nfuture PV panels However, if the used PV panels are not appropriately handled or\nrecycled, then their disposal could cause environmental pollution with toxic\nwaste and become  considerable risk in Armenia ; Social risks \u2013 Given that solar\nPV is  new technology in Armenia, it is possible that there will be  lack of\nlocal labor supply to deploy the technology, and workers and supplies might need\nto be imported to the project site from outside If this happens, this would\nminimize the economic and Armenia employment benefits of deploying this\ntechnology \u2013 Solar PV plants have  large footprint relative to the amount of\nenergy they generate Thus, the deployment of  large-scale solar plant will\nimpact landscapes over large areas Local impacts on landscape character and\nvisual amenity might also be associated with ancillary development (buildings\nand pylons) This might affect property values if the plant is built near\npopulated areas, or might have visual and land access impact on recreational\nactivities such as hiking, eco-tourism, fishing and hunting Impacts to landscape\ncharacter might also lead to the loss of aesthetic value for areas with tourism\npotential and cause associated impacts on local tourism services \u2013 Potential\ndisruption due to noise and dust during construction, such as operational noise\nand vibration \u2013 If the plant is built in an area where there is the potential\nfor other land uses such as mineral extraction, agriculture, or industry, then\nthese alternative land uses will not be able to occur or will need to be delayed\nbecause of the presence of the solar facility \u2013 Transportation of people and\nequipment might impact traffic patterns during construction near the project\nsite 53 Financing Plan and Instruments  Table  presents  plan for financing the\nprojects described in Section  It shows the proposed credits and grants from\nSREP as well as estimates of the amounts anticipated from MDBs and the private\nsector As the table shows, roughly US$ 40 million of SREP funding is expected to\ncatalyze roughly  times as much investment, most of it from the private sector\n(as equity or debt), and the commercial lending windows of the MDBs The\nfinancing modalities will be determined at the time of appraisal, but it is\nexpected that: ; The geothermal exploratory drilling project will be funded\nthrough: () an SREP grant to government, or (ii)  guarantee to private sector\nentities, which might want to undertake the drilling as part of early site\ndevelopment If suitable resource potential is found, the site would be financed\nby  private sector developer whose remuneration would be based on  feed-in-\ntariff or on the terms of  power purchase agreement It is assumed that the\nprivate sector would use  mix of debt and equity for the investment ; For the\nutility-scale solar project, it is foreseen that Government would on-lend SREP\nfunds at concessional rates to private operators bidding on the projects being\ntendered  reverse auction would be used to tender for bidders36 The private\noperators would contribute equity and also source loans from commercial banks\nand from the commercial lending arms of the MDBs Government estimates that,\ngiven current capital costs for utility-scale solar PV, SREP funds could be used\nwith these other sources of financing to support roughly  MW of solar 36 In\nreverse auction, the lowest tariff bid or lowest required subsidy bid (if the\ntariff does not recover the full cost of service) is the principal deciding\nfactor in selecting the winning bidder 54 Table : Indicative Financing Plan SREP\nProject Geothermal Development Project Preparation Geothermal

Investment Plan developed for Armenia is responsive to most\nof the SREP criteria One of the SREP criteria, related to energy access, is not\nrelevant to Armenia as nearly all Armenians have access to energy supply\n(electricity and gas) Table : Summary of Projects\u2019 Responsiveness to SREP\nCriteria Criteria Geothermal Power Development Utility-Scale Solar PV\nDevelopment Increased installed

solar capacity from  to 80 MW by SREP-funded\ninvestments will represent the first 40- 50 MW Armenia is unique among other\nSREP applicants in that it has nearly 100 percent access to

particular, Armenia has impending power capacity gap\nThus, geothermal power and utility-scale solar PV will help to reduce it\nmeanwhile improving energy security supply Geothermal plants produce

could make solar more cost- competitive in the\nnear future The factors include: () new, higher-cost thermal plants being built\nto serve 56 Criteria Geothermal Power Development Utility-Scale Solar

these factors converge, Armenia can look\nto utility-scale solar as  commercially viable alternative to some thermal power\ngeneration 57 Criteria Gender Geothermal Power Development Utility-Scale

are\ndescribed in more detail in Section  and Annex  Additional Development\nActivities  The Government has carefully designed an IP that is complementary to\nthe other activities of the MDBs, private sector, financial institutions and\nother donors The IP builds on Armenia\u2019 successful commitment to introducing\nhigh level of private sector participation in the energy sector, and uses SREP\nresources to leverage further participation The geothermal power project builds\non the extensive preparatory work done by the Armenian government and the R2E2\nFund, much of it funded by the GEF/World Bank More specifically, the GEF/World\nBank provided  US$ million to finance technical field investigation studies for\ntwo potential geothermal sites in Armenia The utility-scale solar PV project\nrecognizes the extensive research and development activities of Armenian\nacademics in the field of solar, and the move in the generation sector to\nprivate financing and operation, rather than government ownership The modality\nof financing the utility-scale solar project leaves open the possibility for\nEBRD, IFC or ADB\u2019 Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) as well as other\nfinancial institutions to provide commercial debt financing that can be blended\nwith the private operator\u2019 equity and other commercial financing Government can\nrely on the R2E2 Fund to help manage the additional work required to identify\nand prepare viable solar projects, and attract possible investors The modality\nof procuring the geothermal and solar projects can further benefit from\nadditional technical advisory services, potentially financed by MDBs, to help\nstructure, tender, and negotiate the contracts with private investors and\noperators Lastly, but not least important, the IP builds on the successful\nsector reforms supported by donors over the past two decades It recognizes the\nimportance of scaling up renewable energy using commercial principles, and with\ntransparent regulation that ensures accountability of service providers 58\nImplementation Potential with Risk Assessment The implementation risk of the IP\nin Armenia is low to moderate The most serious risks are related to the fact\nthat the priority RE technologies in the IP are relatively new to Armenia, and\nhad not, until recently, been considered as options For example, utility-scale\nsolar PV only recently became an option because of the rapid decline in capital\ncosts (driven by changes in prices of raw materials as well as the dynamics of\nsupply and demand for the technology itself) Because the technologies had not\npreviously been seriously considered, there is some risk related to the legal\nand regulatory environment, and the resource potential, as the data on\ngeothermal and solar resource potential are still being collected Table  lists\nand describes the principal risks associated with Armenia\u2019 IP, describes how to\nmitigate those risks, and evaluates the residual level of risk after the\nproposed mitigation measures are implemented Table : Risk Assessment of the SREP\nProgram in Armenia Risk Description Mitigation Residual Risk Moderate Legal\nregulatory risks and Institutional capacity risks and other The regulatory\nframework in Armenia is robust relative to many other countries in the region\nSREP countries There is, however,

Power Project Problem Statement Armenia has no proven oil or\nnatural gas reserves and imports all of its fuel for thermal generation from\nRussia and Iran The country relies on imported natural gas to generate roughly\n30 percent of its power and most of its heat Nuclear fuel, which is used to\ngenerate another 30 percent of electricity in Armenia, is also imported The\nremaining electricity is generated by  series of hydropower plants in the Sevan-\nHrazdan and Vorotan cascades, more than 130 small hydropower plants, and one\nsmall wind farm Armenia\u2019 dependence on imported fuels creates security of supply\nrisks as well as affordability problems for customers The sector is highly\nsusceptible to fuel supply interruptions and price volatility Between 1991 and\n1996\u2014because of disruptions in gas supply\u2014customers suffered through several of\nArmenia\u2019 brutal winters with little more than two hours of electricity supply\nper day Meanwhile, the import price of natural gas has continued to increase The\nincreases of the price of imported gas meant steady increases in end-user\ntariffs for natural gas and electricity Between 2005 and 2013, the end-user\nnatural gas tariff increased by 170 percent End-user residential tariffs for\nelectricity increased 52 percent during the same time period Therefore,\ngeothermal energy can become an affordable source of base-load electricity that\nis generated utilizing indigenous resources, thus, contributing the country\u2019\nenergy security Private investors are typically not willing to assume the\nresource risk and do not finance exploratory drilling With SREP support, the\nGovernment can confirm the resource and, if the resource is confirmed, pursue\ndevelopment of the geothermal power plant with private sector involvement\nProject Objective The overarching objective of the Geothermal Power Project is\nto construct  geothermal power plant at Karkar site The specific objectives are\nto: () confirm the availability of geothermal resource suitable for power\ngeneration; () if the resource is confirmed, then support feasibility study for\nthe Karkar geothermal power plant and transaction advisory services to implement\nPPP Scope of Work The geothermal power project would include the activities\ndescribed below The SREP resources will be used to support Tasks - below Task :\nExploratory Drilling at Karkar Geothermal Site: This step requires carrying out\nexploratory drilling at the site to determine whether or not power could be\nproduced from the resource The exploratory drilling project involves the below\nkey steps: ; Confirming the test well locations: This will require additional\nsoil gas diffusion measurements and GeoRadar study to determine the precise\nlocation of the test wells drawing on recommended approximate locations of two\ntest wells implemented following comprehensive geo-technical investigation works\n64 under the GeoFund : Armenia Geothermal Technical Assistance Project The\nGovernment plans to complete the above studies by September ; Environmental and\nsocial impact assessment This will include assessment of including impacts of\nthe exploratory drilling, environmental and social development of mitigation\nmeasures and management plan ; Preparatory civil works This includes\nconstruction of an access road, preparation of the rig site, and securing access\nto sufficient water supply ; Drilling This will include drilling of two\nexploratory wells to depths of up to ,800 meters ; Well logging and mud logging\nThis will include analyses of the cuttings from the borehole, hole temperature\nand pressure measurements and gathering of essential data (such as drilling\nprogress, circulation losses, changes in flow line temperatures, pump pressure\ndata, etc), both as the drilling progresses and at the end of each drilling\nstage This is for the purpose of having the best information at hand for\ndecision making and problem-solving, as well as gathering all the information on\nthe formation being drilled and estimating rock/brine temperatures When the\ndrilling is finished, an injection test will be performed to estimate if the\npermeability of the well is sufficient or not ; Flow testing, chemical sampling\nand analysis: This will include an assessment of: () the possible power output\nof the well, the ratio between brine and steam, and () enthalpy It will also\ninclude sampling of the brine to analyze the resource as well as estimation of\npossible problems during power production, such as scaling and/or corrosion This\nwill assist in deciding what kind of power conversion techniques should be used\nand if any additional installation, such as inhibitors, will be needed ;\nTechnical supervision: This will include hiring of  technical expert to be on\nsite during the entire duration of the drilling to collaborating on daily basis\non the site to ensure adherence of the drilling contractor to the requirements\nof the contract and making decisions on behalf of the Government in order to\nprevent costly delays in the project Task : Feasibility Study for Karkar Site If\nthe presence of  resource is confirmed,  full feasibility study will need to be\nprepared to recommend the type of geothermal technology/plant to be constructed,\nreassess the economic and financial viability, compliance with environmental and\nsocial safeguards, and to complete legal and regulatory due diligence The legal\nand regulatory due diligence will include recommendations on the need for  feed-\nin tariff specific to geothermal or  recommended structure and method for\nprocuring as  public private partnership in  way that determines the tariff\nthrough bidding (for example,  reverse auction) It will also be necessary to\nevaluate the potential for grid interconnection at the chosen site, and whether\nor not grid upgrades will be necessary for the potential geothermal power plant\nto be connected to the grid Task : Transaction Advisory Services The Government\nwould procure the project as  Public Private Partnership (PPP) Therefore,\nadvisory services will be needed to help structure the PPP (for example, 65 as\nBuild-Operate-Transfer or Build-Own-Operate contract) and procure  private\ninvestor and operator The exact commercial arrangement will need to be developed\nthrough further consultation within government, with donor partners, and with\npotential investors However, the arrangement currently envisaged would involve\nprivate operator having  BOT or BOO agreement under which they finance, build\nand operate the power plant and have  power purchase agreement with the\ndistribution company The Government would own the steam fields, thereby taking\nrisk on the resource availability Task : Development of Geothermal Power Plant\nAs noted above, it is expected that the private sector will make the capital\ninvestment required for generation of electricity (the power plant itself) This\ninvestment plan assumes  plant with net installed capacity of MW, based on the\naverage size of geothermal plants elsewhere The actual size of the plant will\ndepend on the resource potential identified in earlier activities It is also\nexpected that the MDBs, including their private arms (IFC in the World Bank\nGroup, PSOD at ADB, or EBRD), may be able to provide financing to the project as\nway of making it more attractive to other private investors Support from public\nsector MDBs may include concessional lending to Government for the transmission\nlines, roads or other infrastructure required at the site Implementation\nReadiness Armenia has no installed geothermal power plants, but preliminary\nsurface studies suggest that geothermal resources suitable for power production\nmay exist at several sites, including the following four promising sites:\nKarkar, Jermaghbyur, Grizor, and along the Armenian-Georgian border In ,\ncomprehensive surface investigation works were conducted for Karkar site,\nincluding field scouting, magneto-telluric sounding, three-dimensional magneto-\ntelluric sounding as well as early-stage economic and financial appraisal\nEvidence from these activities indicates that  geothermal resource may exist at\nthe site, and can only be confirmed by the drilling of an exploratory wells The\nproposed geothermal power project has high level of implementation readiness\nSpecifically, the following activities are underway or completed: () the World\nBank is supporting the Government with preparation of  detailed exploratory\ndrilling program, including types of test wells; estimated cost of drilling and\nassociated services; identification of potential companies that may be\ninterested to bid for an exploratory drilling project; () the study to determine\nthe precise locations of test wells will be initiated in May 2014 and completed\nby July 2014; () preparation of technical inputs for bidding documents for\nprocurement of drilling contractor; () implementing entity with experience in\nimplementation of donor-funded projects is designated, the R2E2 Fund Rationale\nfor SREP Financing SREP resources would be used for further exploration of\nArmenia\u2019 most promising geothermal site, thereby demonstrating how geothermal\npower is  viable renewable energy resource in Armenia Of the known potential\ngeothermal sites in Armenia, the Karkar site has been the most comprehensively\nassessed through comprehensive surface studies and is the most promising site to\ndate, with possible 66 output estimated at around MW Exploratory drilling is\nrequired to confirm the availability and quality of the resource for power\ngeneration By using SREP grant funding for drilling, the Government can help\nreduce the risk of developing the site If  geothermal resource exists at the\nsite, this support can help make geothermal power  financially attractive\ninvestment for private investors and an affordable source of electricity This\nsupport will serve to demonstrate the feasibility of geothermal power in Armenia\nThe geothermal project is compliant with SREP criteria Table shows how the\nproject complies with SREP criteria Results Indicators The main results\nindicators are expected to be the following: ; Resource confirmation for the\nKarkar site ; Roughly MW of additional electricity generation resulting from the\nproject, depending on resource confirmation ; If the resource is confirmed,\nadoption of  legal, and regulatory framework in to enable future private\ninvestment in geothermal power generation, ; If the resource is confirmed,\nformal government approval of the concept and PPP scheme for construction of\ngeothermal power plant The results indicators will be further specified during\npreparation of the project Financing Plan Table presents  plan for financing of\nthe geothermal power project As the table shows, US$10 million of SREP funding\nis expected to catalyze roughly 11 times as much investment, most of it from the\nprivate sector (as equity or debt), and the commercial lending windows of the\nMDBs The actual amounts financed by each will be determined once the resources\nif confirmed and as the project moves head The financing modalities will be\ndetermined at the time of appraisal, but it is expected that the geothermal\nexploratory drilling project will be funded through: () an SREP grant to\ngovernment, or (ii)  guarantee to private sector entities who might want to\nundertake the drilling as part of early site development If suitable resource\npotential is found, the site would be financed by  private sector developer\nwhose remuneration would be based on  feed-in-tariff or on the terms of  power\npurchase agreement It is assumed that the private sector would use  mixture of\ndebt and equity for the investment 67 Table : Indicative Financing Plan for\nGeothermal Power Project MDB Responsible Govern-ment of Armenia SREP World Bank/\nADB Private Sector (Equity) Com- mercial / private arms of MDBs

Utility-Scale Solar\nPV Problem Statement Poor utilization of energy resources plagues an otherwise\nrobust and sustainable Armenian energy sector Armenia\u2019 thermal power plants\noperate at low efficiency, hydropower plants have low reliability and high\noperation and maintenance costs, grid losses are high, and export potential is\nnot fully realized The sector relies on the old Metsamor nuclear power plant,\nthe decommissioning of which has been postponed twice, from 2016, to 2020, and\nrecently to When decommissioned, Metsamor will leave  substantial power supply\ngap To address these concerns, Armenia plans to increase development of\nindigenous energy resources, especially renewable energy Solar photovoltaic\n(PV), with an estimated potential of over  GW, has the highest potential but is\nnot fully utilized due to high investment costs Armenia\u2019 solar research and\ntechnical experience is limited to solar water heaters, off-grid and small-scale\nPV applications Utility-scale solar PV is now cost-competitive on  life-cycle\nbasis with the other power generation options available to Armenia, given the\ntechnological and declines manufacturing internationally Armenia will benefit\nfrom developing its capacity to scale-up PV technology and take advantage of\nthese cost reductions as these happen combined with advancements continued cost\nCurrent Efforts Armenia has good solar PV resources, with annual average global\nhorizontal irradiation (GHI) ranging from ,490 kWh/m2 to over ,100 kWh/m2 By\ncomparison, average annual GHI is ,000 kWh/m2 in Europe The total resource\npotential for utility-scale solar PV is over ,500 MW However, after accounting\nfor undevelopable areas, the developable resource potential is assumed to be\nmuch lower Assuming polycrystalline solar PV modules mounted at  fixed angle to\nthe sun are deployed in ground-mounted utility-scale plants, solar PV systems\ncould theoretically achieve capacity factors of 20 to 24 in Armenia (dependent\non location) If single-axis tracking solar PV technology is deployed, capacity\nfactors could be as high as 30 percent As part of the preparation of the\nInvestment Plan, nine zones were identified where large-scale, ground-mounted\nsolar PV projects could be built Figure shows the solar zones identified as part\nof the investment plan 73 Figure : Solar Zones Project Objective The objective\nof the utility-scale solar project is to deploy the first of  series of utility-\nscale solar PV projects which, through cost reductions and gradual tariff\nincreases will eventually become commercially viable without SREP/MDB support\nThese first projects will be so small as to have only  very minor impact on the\noverall cost of generation in Armenia, but could have  catalytic effect on the\nmarket for solar PV through: \u2013 Lower solar installation costs that will result\nas  domestic industry develops around it; \u2013 Lower financing costs as lenders\nbecome more comfortable with the technology, and The foreseen increase in\nthermal generation costs in Armenia will move solar toward financial viability\nArmenia\u2019 new thermal plants will require substantially higher tariffs than many\nof the existing plants, because they are fully (or near fully) depreciated and\nno longer recover depreciation charges nor debt service through their generation\ntariffs Scope of Work SREP resources would be used to develop roughly  MW of\nutility-scale solar PV SREP support would help catalyze private investment in\nfirst new plant (or plants), 74 123456789 and show the potential for deploying\nsolar PV on  commercial basis The utility- scale solar PV project would include\nactivities described below Task : Project Preparation, Feasibility Studies, Site\nMeasurement and Monitoring SREP grant funds would first be used to fund more\ndetailed resource assessments, and the identification of possible sites and\npossible projects The activities in this task include: ; Additional site\nmeasurement and monitoring Relatively coarse resolution solar data are publicly\navailable for Armenia Given the nature of solar energy resources, these coarse\ndata are generally acceptable for understanding the nature of the resource and\nconducting  high-level financial analysis However, additional measurement and\nmonitoring will be needed to characterize the solar resource potential in the\nareas targeted for solar development in more detail ; Evaluation of grid\ninterconnection requirements It will be necessary to evaluate the potential for\ngrid interconnection at the chosen site, and whether or not grid upgrades will\nbe necessary before the project is interconnected ; Feasibility study Once\npotential site or sites have been identified,  full feasibility study will be\nneeded to reaffirm the economic and financial viability of the projects, assess\ncompliance with environmental and social safeguards, and complete the legal and\nregulatory due diligence Task : Transaction Advisory Services Transaction\nadvisors would be hired to help government tender for the projects identified in\nTask  Private operators would be procured through competitive tender Bidders\nwould be selected based on technical and financial criteria, the financial\ncriteria being the level of tariff required or, alternatively, the level of\nconcessional support required40 Developers offering lower tariffs or requiring\nless concessional support would receive higher scores The activities in the\ntransaction advisory work include: ; The identification of specific structuring\noptions for the projects where \u201cstructuring\u201d means arrangements related to: \u2013\nThe detailed allocation of responsibilities between public and private partners\n(design, construction, operations, and, if appropriate\u2014financing); \u2013 The way in\nwhich the private partner will be remunerated (for example, through availability\npayments, tariffs payments, or some combination); \u2013 The allocation of risks\nbetween public and private partners, and mechanisms for mitigating such risks; \u2013\nThe length, or term of the PPP contract, and mechanisms during the term of the\ncontract for cost pass-through or indexation, revenue resets or adjustments; 40\nBidders will be offered, as part of the conditions of tender, access to SREP\ncapital contributions 75 \u2013  strategy for procurement, including whether to\ntender bundle or tender separately for design, construction, and operations ;\nThe development of model tender documents for the structures recommended, where\nsuch model documents will include: \u2013  project information memorandum: The\nproject information memorandum will present the project justifications,\nobjectives, scope, information about the structure of the PPP, the location of\nthe assets, land and other conditions, environment, sanitation and labor safety,\nrequired permits and licenses, operational information on existing assets,\nproject output, demand, legal environment, contract management, monitoring of\nprivate partner\u2019 performance, etc \u2013  request for qualifications (RFQ) or request\nfor expressions of interest (EoIs) \u2013  Requests for Proposals (RFP) The RFP will\ndescribe the project proposal, instructions to bidders, evaluation criteria for\nthe proposal, the timeline for instructions for the tender period preparation of\nfinancial and technical proposals, the process and timing for opening of bids,\ninformation about any bid security and guarantees, and clear procedures for\ncommunication between the public authority and bidders including the proposal\ndeadlines, \u2013  draft PPP agreement, including the necessary schedules to the\nagreement Task : Power Generation Project Development SREP funds would be made\navailable to the Government of Armenia which would on-lend SREP funds at\nconcessional rates to private operators bidding on the projects being tendered\nThe private operators would contribute equity and also source loans from\ncommercial banks and from the commercial lending arms of the MDBs Government\nestimates that, given current capital costs for utility-scale solar PV, SREP\nfunds could be used with these other sources of financing to support roughly  MW\nof solar Initial studies indicate that Gegharkunik Marz has some of the highest\nsolar PV potential in Armenia, and would be considered as  first potential area\nfor development This could be  single plant, or several plants with  total\ncapacity of  MW, as development of solar is often more effective if there are\nmultiple sites, in areas with different solar profiles (to provide more\nstability by diversifying generation profiles) Implementation Readiness Solar PV\ndeployment in Armenia to date has been limited to relatively small-scale\nrooftop-based installations at schools, hospitals, office buildings and\nmunicipal sites 76 throughout Armenia41 It is estimated that less than 100 kW of\nsolar PV is currently operational42 Utility-scale solar is non-existent because,\nuntil recently, it was perceived as  high cost technology relative to Armenia\u2019\nalternatives Also, while solar PV power plants are quick to install,\nconsiderable time is required to gather solar irradiation and weather data, to\ndevelop energy yield models for simulation, prepare bankable projects for\nfinancing, and to procure equipment and consulting services Solar PV has become\nmore attractive in recent years as the capital costs of utility- scale solar PV\nprojects have declined The Government has set  target of 40 MW of solar PV by\n2020 and 80 MW of solar PV by There is, moreover, considerable research and\ndevelopment (&) and interest in solar PV within Armenia\u2019 academic institutions\nsolar PV project could catalyze further research and development and facilitate\nthe transfer of capacity for increased participation in solar PV value chain\nArmenia\u2019 development partners, ADB and the World Bank, have  solid track record\nand experience in solar development in the region and have developed solar\ninsolation maps and atlases for several countries including Armenia Rationale\nfor SREP Financing One of the most significant barriers to renewable energy in\nArmenia is the high cost of investment, therefore higher cost per kWh, relative\nto the currently low-cost electricity generation mix The current low cost of\ngeneration makes it difficult for consumers to understand the need for higher-\ncost renewable energy generation over the medium to long term which will satisfy\n\u2013at least initially\u2014only  small portion of demand There are also legitimate\nconcerns about affordability The poorest quintiles of the population allocate\nrelatively higher share of their budgets to electricity than other households\nThese households are likely to experience more significant pressures on their\nbudgets as  result of increased energy tariffs SREP support would help catalyze\nprivate investment in  first new plant (or plants), and show the potential for\ndeploying solar PV on  commercial basis  utility-scale commercial project would\nnot only enable the country to take advantage of this technology in the future\nwhen its costs decline even further, but reduce costs for future projects\nbecause of learning effects, efficiency gains and competition Concessional SREP\nfinancing brings down the cost of solar PV generation closer to grid parity and\naddresses both viability concerns for developers and affordability concerns for\nconsumers Commercial financing is available but there is  shortage of qualified\ndevelopers, with enough risk appetite and willingness to invest despite the lack\nof specific targets and specific feed-in-tariffs for solar PV Site-specific\nsolar resource assessments and institutional capacity are also non-existent\nThese concerns are addressed through technical and capacity building assistance\nand concessional project financing 41 USAAA/US Embassy/EcoTeam/UNDP/GEF, \u201cUse of\nRenewable Energy Sources in the World and Armenia Through Innovations to Clear\nTechnologies,\u201d 2010 42 Preparation of Renewable Energy Development Roadmap for\nthe Republic of Armenia Task  Report,\u201d February 2011 77 Results Indicators The\nmain results indicators are expected to be the following: ; Roughly  MW of\nadditional electricity generation resulting from the project, depending on\nresource confirmation ;  legal, and regulatory framework in place to enable\nfuture private investment in utility-scale solar PV, including either: ()  feed-\nin tariff for future utility- scale solar PV projects; or ()  framework for\nprocuring utility-scale solar PV on  Public Private Partnership (PPP) basis The\nresults indicators will be further specified during preparation of the project\nFinancing Plan As Table shows, roughly US$30 million of SREP funding is expected\nto catalyze roughly  times as much investment in solar PV, most of it from the\nprivate sector (as equity or debt), and the commercial lending windows of the\nMDBs The SREP concessional funds will be used to finance private-sector led\nutility scale solar PV power plants The SREP Utility Scale Solar PV Financing\nFacility will blend SREP funds with ADB and World Bank public sector financing\nto provide loans to cover up to 50 percent of the total investment cost for one\nor two projects, the rest is expected to be mobilized from  combination of\nequity from investors/developers and additional project financing, as\nappropriate, from other financial institutions that may include EBRD, IFC, and\nADB\u2019 Private Sector Operations Department In its Armenia Country Operations\nBusiness Plan (COBP) , the ADB has allocated US$20 million from its Ordinary\nCapital Resources for the project for approval in The World Bank may also\nconsider allocating US$10 million for the potential solar PV project The\ncombination of SREP financing of $million, IFI financing and project sponsors\nwill help to finance US$75 million investments in solar PV (potentially  MW\ninstalled) The ADB may provide additional financing subject to receipt of formal\nrequest from the Government The Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund\nwill be the implementing agency (IA) and will act as financial intermediary and\nproject management office SREP will provide  technical assistance grant of US$\nmillion for onsite solar irradiation and weather measurements, pre-feasibility\nstudies including up to  project feasibility studies and project preparation for\nthe first solar PV project/ to be auctioned ADB has also allocated US$ million\ntechnical assistance grant in 2015 to prepare the Financial Intermediary Loan\nfor ADB approval in SREP grant funding of US$ million is also expected to\nfinance transaction advisors to assist the IA in structuring and developing the\nPV project to be financed under the SREP Loan Facility Transaction advisors\nprovide advice on optimal commercial and financial structures, conduct due\ndiligence, prepare bidding documents and project contracts, marketing/roadshow,\nassist in bid evaluation, auctioning, and financial closing  reverse auction,\ninstead of  feed-in-tariff mechanism, will be used for setting the solar PV\ntariff The tariff for  predetermined maximum aggregate PV capacity will then be\nbased on the lowest qualifying bid An indicative tariff will be calculated 78\nbased on the financing terms offered under the SREP Loan Facility and used as\nbenchmark for evaluating bids This tariff is not set officially nor

macroeconomic; regulatory and\ninstitutional, technical and managerial dimensions of the country\u2019 absorptive\ncapacity  Macroeconomic Outlook Armenia continues to recover from the impact of\nthe global financial crisis After  contraction of 14 percent in 2009, GDP has\ngrown steadily GDP grew at  rate of  84 percent in 2010,  percent in 2011, and\npercent in GDP grew  percent in the first quarter of Armenia\u2019 total external\ndebt is estimated at percent of GDP by the end of 2012,  large share of which is\nowed by the public sector Public external debt has increased substantially since\n2008, but does not yet breach indicative thresholds Public external debt was\nabout 16 percent of GDP at end-2008, reaching 35 percent of GDP at end-\nGovernment efforts at fiscal consolidation have been showing results and with\ncontinued GDP growth, are projected to lead to  gradual reduction in the debt-\nto-GDP ratio Gross external financing (debt service payments) has remained\naround  percent of GDP over the last decade During the recent IDA-16 Mid-Term\nReview, Armenia and  few similar countries were deemed ineligible for\nconcessional financing under IDA- 43 However, Armenia applied for deferral of\nits graduation More recently, inflation has become  problem for Armenia, due\nlargely to higher energy and food prices The 12-month inflation was  percent in\nDecember 2012, well within the central bank\u2019 target range of \u00b1 percent However,\nin July 2013, the PSRC increased domestic natural gas and electricity tariffs to\nreflect an increase in the cost of gas imports from Russia End-user natural gas\nand electricity tariffs were increased by 18 percent and 27 percent,\nrespectively Legal, Regulatory and Institutional   combination of policy, legal,\nregulatory and institutional reforms has helped to achieve remarkable results in\nthe energy sector Government has made  consistent\u2014if often difficult\u2014effort to\ncreate  legal, regulatory and institutional environment which provides good\nquality, reliable electricity supply that is affordable for end-users, and\nconducive to private sector investment Overview of Reforms Armenia undertook\nmajor power sector reforms after the severe electricity crisis that followed\nindependence Between 1992 and 1996, customers suffered through brutal winters\nwith little more than two hours of electricity per day By 1995, fiscal and\nquasi-fiscal subsidies to the power sector had reached  level of roughly 11\npercent of Armenia\u2019 GDP Cash collections were around 50 percent, and nearly 25\nand nearly 25 percent of all power produced disappeared before the meters as\ncommercial losses (mostly electricity theft) The power sector included the\nfollowing ; Unbundling and privatizing the power system Efforts began in 1995 to\nunbundle the power system and privatize the power sector Armenergo, the state-\nowned vertically integrated utility, was separated into generation and\ndistribution entities In March 1997,  Presidential Order and new Energy Law\nformalized separate generation, distribution, transmission and dispatch During\n43 IDA (2012), \u201cIDA16 Mid-Term Review Graduation Paper\u201d, Concessional Finance\nand Global Partnership (CFP), World Bank, September 85 , ownership of several\nmajor generating plants was transferred from the Government in exchange for\nstate debt forgiveness ; Establishing an independent regulator The Presidential\nOrder and the Energy Law enacted in 1997 established an independent energy\nsector regulator, the Armenian Energy Regulatory Commission (AERC) The Law on\nthe Regulatory Body for Public Services, enacted in 2004, changed the name of\nthe regulator to the Public Services Regulatory Commission (PSRC) and expanded\nits authority to other sectors, including water, drainage and sewage, and\ntelecom ; Achieving sectoral financial sustainability Three steps were essential\nto increase collections, reducing commercial losses and improving the overall\nfinancial sustainability of the sector The steps were: \u2013 Installing meters\nBetween 1997 and 1998, twelve thousand new tamper- proof meters were installed\nthroughout the power system at  variety of voltage levels down to  kV\nResidential customer meters were relocated to public areas An Automated Metering\nand Data Acquisition System (AMDAS) was installed in 2001 and linked to\nsettlement center to facilitate accurate meter reading at the 110 kV and above \u2013\nBringing tariffs to cost recovery levels In 1994, Armenia began  gradual\ntransition to cost-based tariffs by bring household tariffs to the average level\nof other retail tariffs  schedule was established for further household tariff\nhikes Since 1999, household tariffs have remained well above the overall average\ntariff \u2013 Increasing transparency in collections and billing The Electricity\nDistribution Company (EDC) installed  computerized customer information system\nto better track utilization and billing In 1999, the EDC established  new\ncollection scheme requiring bill payments at post offices instead of cash\npayments at local EDC offices, which reduced opportunities for collusion between\ncustomers and EDC inspectors The result of the reforms are clear Since 1996,\n24-hour electricity service has been restored and gradually customers have\nswitched to cheaper, more efficient gas heating Meanwhile, tariff increases and\noperating efficiency improvements have helped create commercially viable service\nproviders, technical and non-technical losses have decreased, and collections\nhave increased The energy sector is now one of the largest taxpayers in Armenia\nReforms targeting renewable energy The reform efforts have included the\ndevelopment of domestic energy resources that have helped to improve Armenia\u2019\nsecurity of energy supply Energy security is  central concern of the Armenian\nDevelopment Strategy (ADS) and National Security Strategy (NSS) These documents\nemphasize the importance of renewable energy and energy efficiency in addressing\nthis concern In 2007, the PSRC set renewable energy feed-in tariffs to stimulate\nprivate investment in renewable energy ENA is obliged to off-take all of the\npower generated by the new plants under the 15-year power purchase agreements\nmandated by the legislation According to the feed-in tariff methodology, the\nPSRC 86 must adjust feed-in tariffs annually in line with changes in inflation\nand the USD to AMD exchange rate fluctuations (USD/AMD for SHPPs, USD/EUR for\nwind) The feed- in tariff regime has been successful in attracting private\ninvestment in more than 200 MW of small hydropower  Technical and Managerial\nPublic and private entities in Armenia have extensive experience working with\nMDBs and implementing MDB-financed projects ; MENR has excellent technical staff\nwith long-standing experience in the power sector reform process MENR also\nenjoys the support of the Energy Institute CJSC,  research entity with extensive\nexperience in Armenia\u2019 energy sector ; The R2E2 Fund is  non-profit organization\nestablished by the Government in 2005 with the mandate to promote the\ndevelopment of renewable energy and energy efficiency markets in Armenia and to\nfacilitate investments in these sectors The implementation of the project as\nwell as overall R2E2 Fund operations will be supervised by the Board of Trustees\n(BOT), consisting of representatives of government agencies,

experience projects For the World Bank it is\ncurrently implementing the GeoFund : Armenia Geothermal Project, and in the past\nhas implemented several World Bank-financed projects including the Urban Heating\nProject, Renewable Energy Project and an Electricity Supply Reliability Project\nin ; Private banks As describe elsewhere in this document, there are  number of\ncommercial banks in Armenia (Ameria Bank, Analik Bank, HSBC, Byblos Bank and\nothers) who have experience on-lending donor funds for renewable energy projects\n87 Annex : Stakeholder Consultations Armenia\u2019 SREP Investment Plan is the result\nof an extensive internal and public consultation process, led by the Government\nof Armenia and represented by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, to\nidentify priorities in the development of renewable energy technologies for\nelectricity and heating The consultations included  wide range of government\nagencies, as well as representatives from the private sector, civil society, and\nacademia Discussions were informed by the analysis of the Renewable Resources\nand Energy Efficiency (R2E2) Fund and its consultants44 Feedback was sought\nthrough many one-on-one meetings,  workshop with the Government\u2019 SREP working\ngroup, as well as an open forum Scoping Mission (July -12, 2012) The purpose of\nthe scoping mission was to explore potential areas of engagement for SREP, and\ndiscuss plans for preparing the investment plan The scoping mission included\ndiscussions with MENR, PSRC, donors and bilateral agencies (KfW, USAID, UNDP,\nJICA, UNIDO), R2E2 Fund, the Energy Institute of the Republic of Armenia,\ncommercial banks and several private sector entities engaged in renewable energy\nprojects  consultative workshop was also held and attended by 60 participants\nfrom the Government, private sector, donors, and academia In addition, the MDB\nteam also conducted site visits to two small hydro power plants,  biogas power\nplant, and  solar water heating installation First Joint Technical Mission (June\n-, 2013) The purpose of the first joint technical mission was to get feedback on\nthe set of criteria to be used to evaluate and prioritize projects for the IP,\nand to collect data for use in evaluating each technology or resource against\nthe criteria The first joint technical mission included discussions between\nMENR, Ministry of Finance, R2E2 Fund, its consultants, and the MDB team working\non SREP R2E2 Fund and its consultants also met with HVEN, the Armenian Power\nSystem Operator,  private geothermal heat pump developer, the Armenian\nScientific Research Institute of Energy, the Institute of Geological Sciences at\nthe National Academy of Sciences of Armenia, commercial banks, Yerevan Municipal\nGovernment, and various technical experts in geothermal, solar and other\ntechnologies being considered Second Joint Technical Mission (August\n28-September , 2013 The purpose of the second joint technical mission was to\nsolicit feedback from stakeholders on substantive portions of the draft IP The\nsecond joint technical mission included discussions between MENR, Ministry of\nFinance, R2E2 Fund, its consultants, the MDB team working on SREP, and other key\nstakeholders 44 Lists of stakeholders consulted during the joint missions are\nalso available in various Aide-Memoire posted on website the ( Investment\nClimate Funds (CIF) 88 The analytical work completed in preparing the IP\nincluded  comprehensive assessment of renewable energy technologies identified\nduring the first technical mission The technologies included: wind: utility-\nscale solar PV; concentrating solar PV, distributed solar PV, small hydropower,\npumped storage hydropower, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) biogas-to-power,\nagricultural biogas-to-power, landfill biogas-to-power, biomass (wood/grain),\ngeothermal power, solar thermal water heating, geothermal district heating and\ngeothermal heat pumps The mission included two stakeholder consultation\nworkshops to get feedback on the analysis: ; On August 30, 2013, the proposed\npriority RE technologies to be developed in Armenia were presented to the multi-\nsectoral task force established in 2011 for review/discussion of issues\npertaining to development of renewable energy and energy efficiency in the\ncountry The task force approved the priority RE technologies proposed to be\nsupported under the SREP IP ; On September , 2013, the Government also organized\nopen public consultations with representatives of civil society, NGOs, private\nsector, project developers, research institutions, academia, and donor\norganizations The participants were overall supportive of main findings,\nconclusions and recommendations regarding priority RE technologies to be\nsupported in Armenia There was unanimous support for development of utility-\nscale PV, given consensus on the estimated large potential and increasingly\nattractive unit costs of energy given significant reduction in module costs over\nthe last several years The participants also suggested to include in the\npriority list some RE technologies, which had low levelized energy costs (LEC)\nand other benefits, such as biogas, however, the Government noted the limited\npotential for scaling up those technologies in the country In addition to the\ntwo workshops, the main findings of the analysis and proposed RE priorities were\nposted on the web-site of the R2E2 Fund for public comments45 45 On August 24,\n89 Annex : Co-Benefits Section  highlighted some of the environmental, social\nand gender co-benefits likely to result from Armenia\u2019 SREP IP This section\nfocuses specifically on the co-benefits tracked under SREP\u2019 Revised Results\nFramework (as of June , 2012) Annex Table  lists the co-benefits considered\nunder SREP\u2019 Revised Results Framework, and describes how those co-benefits will\nbe achieved in Armenia Annex Table : Co-Benefits Associated with SREP Impacts\nand Outcomes Results Co-benefits Description SREP Transformative Impact Avoided\nGHG emissions Support low- carbon development pathways by increasing energy\nsecurity Employment opportunities SREP Program Outcomes Increased reliability\nIncreased supply of renewable energy (RE) New and additional resources for\nrenewable energy projects/programs ; As described in Section , all of the\ntechnologies in Armenia\u2019 SREP IP could be used to offset thermal generation\nduring daily dispatch, and ultimately forestall the need for additional thermal\n(nuclear or gas) generation The generation government has targeted for new solar\nand geothermal plants promises to offset roughly 83,000 tonnes of CO2 by 2020\nand 234,000 tonnes of CO2 by 46 ; Potential short-term job creation during\nexploration of the geothermal site Potential for both short and long-term job\ncreation during the development and operations of  geothermal and utility-scale\nsolar PV plant Estimates from one study suggest that geothermal project funded\nby SREP could generate as many as 850 job-years, and the solar project could\ngeneration 237 job-years47 ; Given the remote location and rural nature of the\nKarkar geothermal site and the Gegharkunic Marz solar site, the projects could\nalso help reduce rural unemployment in the surrounding areas ; All of the\ntechnologies in Armenia\u2019 SREP IP would ultimately improve long-term reliability\nof supply, by strengthening energy security and reducing the risk that fuel\nsupply interruptions could lead to reliability problems The technologies are\neffectively  hedge against future gas import price hikes ; The geothermal power\nproject could, in particular, improve supply reliability because it represents\npotential source of baseload generation, rather than interruptible supply ; Grid\nenhancements required to connect the solar PV and 46 Given Armenia\u2019 estimated\nGrid Emissions Factor of 181  CO2/kWh, based on estimate by the Climate Registry\n( Factorspdf) 47 Job-years are calculated instead of just calculating \u201cjobs\u201d\nbecause each technology creates both short-term and long-term jobs In order to\ncompare each technology using just  single metric, \u201cjob-years\u201d created over the\nlife of the project are calculated These are estimated using the costs estimated\nfor each technology in this project and data from Wei , Patadia , Kammen  (2008)\n\u2018Putting renewables and energy efficiency to work: how many jobs can the clean\nenergy industry generate in the US?\u2019Note that job creation estimates presented\nhere are somewhat uncertain because estimates of the job creation potential of\nrenewable technologies are only available for developed countries 90 Reduced\ncosts of RE geothermal projects may also offer improvements in grid reliability\n; SREP support for exploratory drilling at Karkar will reduce the generation\ntariff required by private investors because the grants (or insurance) will be\nused to absorb the cost of the riskiest stage of development of  geothermal site\n; SREP capital contributions for utility-scale solar PV will reduce the\ngeneration tariff required by the first plant() More importantly, SREP support\nwill pave the way for more competitive solar PV plants in the future, by giving\nArmenia some experience in utility-scale solar PV This early experience will\nhelp to bring down the costs of future plants and improve investors\u2019 perceptions\nof the risk of utility- scale solar in Armenia 91 Annex : Existing Activities in\nthe Field of Renewable Energy Existing activities in the field of renewable\nenergy in Armenia involve the continued development of private small HPPs, the\nrehabilitation of existing large HPPs and the development of some new large\nHPPs, the exploration of the Karkar geothermal site, and the implementation of\nsome small pilot renewable heating projects This Annex describes each of these\nactivities Hydropower Project Rehabilitation and Development Small HPPs make up\nthe vast majority of Armenia\u2019 renewable energy industry (excluding from large\nHPPs) As of May 2013, 221 MW of small HPPs are operating, and 168 MW of SHPPs\nhave received licenses for development from the PSRC Small HPP development has\nbeen supported by both private, commercial banks in Armenia, as well as\ninternational development banks KfW has been supporting the development and\nrehabilitation of small HPPs through America Bank and other commercial banks in\nArmenia Through this program, domestic commercial banks have been able to offer\nrelatively low-cost, long-term capital for small HPP development There has also\nbeen activity in the large hydropower industry EBRD is financing the\nrehabilitation of the Sevan-Hrazdan HPP and KfW is financing the rehabilitation\nof the Vorotan cascade Iran is allegedly providing financing for the\nconstruction of the Meghri hydropower project, which is scheduled to come online\nin The energy from the Meghri plant is expected to go to Iran for the first 15\nyears of its operation before ownership of the plant is given to Armenia\nGeothermal The World Bank has financed ongoing assessments of the Karkar\ngeothermal site, including an economic and financial appraisal of  potential\nplant at the site In September 2013,  team of World Bank staff and consultants\ntraveled to the Karkar site to identify next steps for surface studies and\nexploratory drilling at the site Renewable Heating Recently, two solar thermal\nheating projects have been implemented in the Shirak region of Armenia, through\nthe GEF Small Grants Programme One of these projects involved the implementation\nof solar thermal heating at  housing complex, and reduced natural gas\nconsumption by approximately 40 percent The other project was implemented at\nkindergarten, and there are plans to expand the project to  nearby greenhouse\nGreenhouses are major consumers of heat energy in Armenia and this project could\nprovide valuable demonstration benefits for this particular

Allen provided an independent technical review of the\ninvestment plan He reviewed two drafts of the Investment Plan, one from\nSeptember 2013, and  revised draft from April His comments on each of the\ndrafts, and the Government of Armenia\u2019 replies, are included below Independent\nTechnical Reviewer: Mike Allen Comments delivered on September 30th, 2013\nIntroduction The review of the Investment Plan for Armenia has been undertaken\nahead of the submission of the plan to the SREP Sub-Committee of the Strategic\nClimate Funds, within the Climate Investment Funds at the World Bank These notes\nare based on  review of the draft plan of 18th September 2013; it should be\nnoted that the reviewer has not visited Armenia nor been involved in the\npreparation of this plan The lack of  visit to Armenia and direct contact with\nthe ministries, agencies, institutions and various stakeholders has an impact on\nsome of the interpretations that have been drawn in this review; the reviewer\nhas not been involved with energy opportunities in Armenia so has limited\nfamiliarity with the energy situation in the region It is recognised that, as\nstated in the IP, \u201cArmenia\u2019 population has nearly universal access to\nelectricity and natural gas energy resources, therefore Armenia\u2019 IP is not about\naccess to modern energy services but about using renewables to improve energy\nsecurity and reliability, and reduce the future cost of supply Energy security,\nreliability and cost are challenges that investments in renewable energy can\nhelp overcome given Armenia\u2019 unique energy context\u201d and it is in this context\nthat this review has been undertaken Given the specific areas of focus under the\nPlan, geothermal, utility scale solar and development of geothermal heat pump\nand solar-thermal projects, the review first considers each of the sectors then\nsummarises the overall compliance under SREP criteria  Specific Comments on\nInvestment Plan  Geothermal Power Development Current Situation Based on the\ninformation presented in the report, independent background work and brief\ncorrespondence with those who have prepared the IP, there does not appear to be\nstrong case to support the use of SREP funds for geothermal exploration It is\nacknowledged that geothermal exploration finance is difficult to source but the\nIP and background suggest that: The Karkar geothermal prospect is not well\nunderstood and exploration data gathered to date does not appear to provide\nconvincing model of  resource at  stage where drilling should be immediately\ncontemplated; Response: The Karkar geothermal field was thoroughly studied\nthrough  number of comprehensive surface studies: () field scouting; () magneto-\ntelluric investigation study (MT); () independent interpretation of the results\nof MT study; () 3D MT study; and () independent interpretation of the 100\nresults of 3D MT study Those studies were led by reputable international\nconsulting firms specializing on geothermal energy Moreover, the recommendations\nand key findings of those studies were reviewed by the Iceland Geosurvey (ISOR),\nwhich confirmed that the methodology employed for the surface studies was\nrobust, the key results indeed confirm that the Karkar is  geothermal site, and\nthat the only way to confirm the suitability of resource for power generation is\nto conduct exploratory drilling Assumptions in giving geothermal  high ranking\nin terms of potential and cost are not substantiated in the IP nor by background\ndocuments; Response: Geothermal power is assigned the second lowest ranking in\nterms of \u201cscale-up potential\u201d However, this is partially because of the fact\nthat Armenia\u2019 geothermal resources have not been well-explored (except for\nKarkar site) and it is possible that there is more resource potential than has\nbeen quantified here Indications are that any resource at Karkar will be of\nmodest temperatures; all analyses and cost comparisons in the IP assume  high\ntemperature resource; lower temperatures resources are acknowledged in the IP as\nnon-competitive; Response: The temperature of the resource cannot be known for\nsure until the exploratory drilling is conducted and flow testing, chemical\nsampling and analyses is completed The surface studies that were conducted for\nKarkar site and are described in the IP concluded that two conceptual geothermal\nmodels or their combination might exist for the Karkar site: Model : Model\nassumes that low resistance is not present in the geothermal zones of interest\nIn such  case, Model  would provide only for  diffuse source of heat and\ncharacterizes the field as  reservoir of moderately warm waters (less than\n100\u043e\u0421) Model : Model  assumes that low resistance may be present in geothermal\nzones of interest In such  case, Model  would provide for  localized high-\ntemperature source of heat Along with this, some of the layers could be\ncharacterized as  reservoir of high-temperature water (more than 250\u043e\u0421) The\ndefinitive answer on the characteristics of the geothermal resource can be\nobtained only after exploratory drilling The costs are presented in the IP for\nhigh-temperature resource because it is assumed that project development will\nonly occur if  high-temperature resource is identified at the site through the\nexploratory well drilling The assumption that with this background that an IPP\ncan be attracted to contribute as indicated is probably unrealistic meaning that\nadditional public funds would be required to move any successful project forward\nResponse: It is recommended that SREP funding supports these exploration\nactivities and IPP investment is assumed to follow if successful exploration is\ncarried out Therefore, it is assumed that an IPP will not be attracted with the\nbackground information available in the IP, but rather with  confirmed\ngeothermal resource that has been identified through exploratory drilling 101\nNear Term Consideration of Geothermal Accepting that the geothermal potential\nmay be limited, if there is  consensus that the case for further investment is\nunclear, the use of limited funds from SREP to convene  focused peer review of\ncurrent status could be considered It is not suggested that the allocation of\nlarger portion of SREP funds be predicated on the outcome of such  review but\nmore that it may be reasonable to use funds (less than suggested for the\nfeasibility study) to attempt to provide  more definitive assessment of the\nKarkar resource If the review were to provide  convincing argument to consider\nthe next stage of exploration at Karkar then it could be used to seek\nalternative funding Response: We are confident that any additional study for\nKarkar site will generate marginal amount of useful information and data\nTherefore, we are convinced that exploratory drilling is the warranted next step\nto be undertaken to confirm the resource As mentioned above, all of the above\nstudies conducted for Karkar concluded that exploratory drilling is warranted\nThe need for and the justification for exploratory drilling was also confirmed\nby the independent reviewers (ISOR from Iceland) of the key conclusions and\nrecommendations of the geo-technical studies conducted for Karkar Recommendation\non Geothermal Power At this stage it is not recommended that SREP funds be\ndirected into geothermal power development, other than in supporting  review as\noutlined above Response: We do not think that the level of knowledge about the\nKarkar site will benefit from further reviews as outlined above  Utility Scale\nSolar General compliance While there is limited solar PV experience at any large\nscale, the potential has been identified and the construction of commercial,\ngrid connected units reflects international experience It is noted that there\nare nationally based companies engaged in this field and that there is  strong &\nbackground in the field within Armenian academia It is understood that to\nencourage private sector participation that part of the SREP funds may be made\navailable to help buy down the initial capital costs, Help is being sought to\ndevelop an acceptable FIT and also to work with the government in agreeing how\nprivate sector participation will be structured Capacity to execute and\ntechnical assessment of proposed approach There are  number of barriers that\nhave been recognised as hampering the growth in the sector and these have been\nidentified within the Plan It is suggested that these are manageable; the\ntechnology risk is largely one of lack of familiarity coupled with  lack of\neducation amongst the population about the benefits they can bring Although the\nmarket has been opened up, and success in attracting IPPs noted in the small\nhydro power sector, it is also noted that there are administrative and\nregulatory issues that may hamper quick uptake by the private sector of other\ntechnologies 102 The Plan is non-specific about which institutions will address\nthese issues but it paints  positive picture of government activities in the\nsector and its privatisation over recent years It is noted that at all stages\nSREP will be consulted as strategies, structures and plans are being prepared\nand adequate monitoring and evaluation will be mutually important to ensure\nsuccess Impact The plan outlines the use of funds to provide support to  broader\nMDB and donor funded programme which is envisaged will provide utility solar\nelectricity of some 30 MW in total capacity This is based on obtaining  total of\n$75m (SREP $5m; MDBs $5m and $21m from private sector / commercial banking\nsources) The securing of these additional funds and the active engagement of the\nprivate sector is obviously critical to the level of impact that will be\nachieved Use of investment; capturing and dissemination of lessons learned;\nstakeholder engagement This is all  new venture and so there is no real history\nof such development in Armenia to draw on It will be important that there be an\nopen and transparent sharing of information and experiences as the project is\nplanned and implemented Social considerations It is recognised that the\nchallenge for Armenia is to build security of supply as all have access to\nenergy but the geo-political and energy supply dependency of the country are the\nkey issues to be addressed with the focus on renewables The normal benefits of\nrenewables in terms of emission reductions will of course apply Attraction of\nadditional investment The programme proposed for the utility solar project is\nheavily dependent on access to investment from  number of groups as noted above\nIt is unclear what the level of commitments from other sources is at this stage\nThere is however  provision for support with transaction services that should\nhelp overcome recognised bottlenecks but project implementation will only be\nachieved to the level that available funds allow Overall Summary The utility\nsolar programme is aggressive but appears to offer one of the better options for\nArmenia in looking towards growth in renewables Tackling solar PV on  larger\nscale basis should offer quicker growth in this sector and the combination of\nSREP, MDB and private financing provides  potentially balanced scenario for this\ngrowth The project is  mix of public demonstration of commercial viability of\nthis opportunity and then the securing of financing from MDB and private sector\nsources; increasing the scale of activities and drawing all the elements of the\nprogramme together, while addressing the issues that have been seen as\nbottlenecks in the past, will require strong strategic planning and on-going\nreview to ensure that the anticipated growth target can be met  Geothermal Heat\nPump and Solar-Thermal Projects General compliance To date there have been\nlimited developments utilising geothermal heat pumps and/or solar thermal\ninstallations However given the heating needs within Armenia and the opportunity\nthat these approaches may give to displace the use of gas, this programme\nappears appropriate Small scale projects (supported by GEF) have helped begin to\ndemonstrate the viability of solar thermal installations The structure of this\nproject suggests that the intention is to hold this largely within the public\nsector with financing predominantly from MDB resources It is noted that there\nare nationally based companies engaged in these fields 103 Capacity to execute\nand technical assessment of proposed approach As with solar PV, there are\nnumber of barriers that have been recognised as hampering the growth in the\nsector and these have been identified within the Plan It is suggested that these\nare manageable; the technology risk is largely one of lack of familiarity\ncoupled with  lack of education amongst the population about the benefits they\ncan bring Impact The plan outlines the use of funds to prepare proposals to gain\nsupport from MDBs It is suggested that obtaining  total of $45m from MDBs would\nallow dissemination of these technologies in public buildings ($15m) and private\nfacilities ($30m) The securing of these funds and an active programme outside\nthe public sector is obviously critical to the level of impact that will be\nachieved Use of investment; capturing and dissemination of lessons learned;\nstakeholder engagement This is all  new venture and so there is no real history\nof such development in Armenia to draw on As with the solar PV, it will be\nimportant that there be an open and transparent sharing of information and\nexperiences as the projects are planned and implemented Social considerations It\nis recognised that the challenge for Armenia is to build security of supply as\nall have access to energy but the geo-political and energy supply dependency of\nthe country are the key issues to be addressed with the focus on renewables The\nnormal benefits of renewables in terms of emission reductions will of course\napply Attraction of additional investment The programme proposed for the\ngeothermal heat pump and solar thermal project is heavily dependent on access to\ninvestment from MDBs as noted above It is unclear what the level of commitments\nfrom these sources is at this stage Overall Summary The geothermal heat pump and\nsolar thermal programme is aggressive but appears to offer  constructive option\nfor Armenia in looking towards growth in the non-electric use of renewables\nDeveloping both technologies on  larger scale basis should offer quicker growth\nin this sector but access to MDB financing is clearly critical  Compliance with\nSREP Key focuses within the SREP programme can be summarised under the following\nheadings; the response of the Plan to each of these aspects is noted in the\nfollowing comments The exception to use of funds for geothermal is noted again\nCatalyse increased investments in renewable energy: The plan outlines how it is\nanticipated that SREP investments and programme support will help attract other\npublic and private funding This is explained in some detail What is less clear\nis which government agencies will provide the leadership during implementation\nOverall there is no information on the governance of the SREP programme as such\nResponse: This comment is well-noted Additional description of implementation\nmodalities will follow in  subsequent draft Enabling environment The plan\nacknowledges that there are  number of remaining hurdles to renewable\nimplementation; there are however no clear strategies or allocation of\nresponsibilities to particular agencies to address these It is assumed that\nmore definitive strategy will be developed ahead of the release of SREP 104\nfunding The proposal to assist with transactional services in the solar sector\nshould offer additional encouragement for private sector participation Response:\nThis comment is well-noted Additional description of strategies for improving\nthe enabling environment in specific agencies will follow in  subsequent draft\nIncrease energy access: As noted, access to energy is not an issue for Armenia;\nthe focus of SREP supported activities is the development of  reliable, cost\neffective and secure supply of national energy going forward Implementation\ncapacity: The IP explains that the entity responsible for facilitating renewable\nenergy development in Armenia is the R2E2 Fund The R2E2 Fund was formed in 2006\nas part of the Law on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy It is an\nindependent organization that facilitates investments in renewable energy by\nsponsoring renewable energy studies and projects, and supporting local renewable\nenergy companies and stakeholders Its role in hydro, geothermal and solar is\nbriefly described but no additional information is provided It is assumed that\nit would be  key organisation in proving the governance over the SREP activities\nImprove the long-term economic viability of the renewable energy sector: The\nrenewable energy sector in Armenia appears to be in  nascent stage The existing\nsources of energy do provide  relatively low cost source of electricity and heat\nand so the growth in renewable sector and the national benefits that it may\noffer, in terms of energy security, may require subsidisation to some extent It\nis noted that there are  number of existing businesses supporting the industry\nand the SREP activities should be managed to ensure that the national benefits\nare maximised wherever possible Transformative impact: The targeted nature of\nthe proposed SREP investments is seen as  pragmatic approach As noted above, the\nrenewable sector is relatively immature so it is unlikely that there will be\nmajor transformations in the market through SREP alone but, well managed,\nfocused programme around will add to the emerging strengths within the sector\nRecommendations With the exception of the concerns around the geothermal power\ndevelopments, the Investment Plan as presented is well prepared There is limited\ndetail on how SREP funds would be managed, by whom and under what governance\nstructure, and it is suggested that clarification on these points be sought If\nit is agreed that funding proposed for geothermal power development not be\noffered as requested then there is  clear opportunity to revisit the priorities\nunder the Plan; this might provide for an extension of the other programme areas\nor the introduction of an additional sector This decision needs consideration by\nthose closer to the preparation of the Plan Overall the Plan responds to the\nSREP criteria This report and these recommendations have not been discussed with\nthose who prepared the Plan, and so should be treated as interim comments; it is\nhoped that  discussion can be arranged in due course 105 ADDENDUM Summary\nDrilling Proposal of Comments re Inclusion of Geothermal Comments As raised in\nvarious communications earlier, there is  concern about the emphasis given to\ncommitting almost 50% of the SREP funds to geothermal exploration drilling\nreview of the various reports provided and the IP itself do not substantiate\nthat geothermal should be of high priority This viewed is based on the\nfollowing: The ranking of options in Table  shows that geothermal (power\ngeneration) is considered to rank  \u201c\u201d for Scale Up Potential and yet all other\ndata suggests that the anticipated geothermal potential is minimal in comparison\nto other sources \u2013 even if this were  \u201c\u201d, the geothermal average would drop to\nCosts effectiveness (\u201c\u201d) assumes  high temperature resource (flash technology)\nwhich is not able to be demonstrated with confidence Response: It appears there\nis  misunderstanding of the scoring system that has been put forth in the IP The\nscoring system has caused confusion for several reviewers, so it is clear that\nwe should change it to be more intuitive, or explain it more explicitly\nAccording to the current scoring system,  score of \u201c\u201d for \u201cScale-up potential\u201d\nactually indicates relatively low scale-up potential Table : Ranking of\nRenewable Technologies Against Selection Criteria Technology Selection Criteria\nPower grid stability Cost- effectiveness Potential for

Distributed solar PV\n106    report \u201cEconomic and Financial Appraisal of the Potential Geothermal\nPower Plant at Karkar Final Report, November 2012, by Denzel Hankinson\u201d makes\nnumber of assumptions and is essentially  generic review of geothermal costs\nComments in the report on likely production temperatures, the understood\ngeological setting in Karkar and notes in response to earlier queries, tend to\nsuggest that  conservative view would be that the temperatures will be modest\nHowever all support for geothermal is based on  costing that utilises  flash\ntechnology \u2013 implying high geothermal fluid temperatures By the analysis in\nHankinson\u2019 report it is acknowledged that if flash technology cannot be used the\ngeothermal utilising ORC would be non-competitive with other alternatives Based\non the assumption that the KarKar resource may be of modest temperature, it\nwould therefore not rank as competitive Acknowledging that there is no\ngeothermal development background in Armenia, the IP does not demonstrate  full\nunderstanding of the challenges of geothermal development While it is accepted\nthat drilling will in the end be required to prove the quality of any resource,\nmoving to  drilling programme would not normally be considered until many of the\nuncertainties expressed in the geothermal studies to date have been addressed\nSpecific geothermal studies have not been reviewed; it is not known what depth\nof practical geothermal experience those who have undertaken the various studies\nhave had, but it may be that engaging  peer review by groups with extensive\npractical exploration and development experience would allow  more concrete\ndecision on the geothermal viability Geothermal exploration and development is\nby its very nature  capital intensive exercise There is  concern that, without\nclear upside and identified resources to take any geothermal development forward\nshould exploration drilling confirm an exploitable resource, the investment into\nan exploration drilling programme at this stage may be wasted Available tariffs,\nthe small scale of any project and the conservative assumption that resource\ntemperatures will be modest, suggest that it may be difficult to attract private\ninvestment into geothermal This would then imply that adequate public funding\nwould have to be found to take any project through to completion Response: the\nreviewer\u2019 comments are noted and his expertise is useful and appreciated for\nthis process Summary of Correspondence and Responses: In working through the IP\nam having  fundamental problem understanding why the priorities have been chosen\nas they have In looking at Table  it appears that the estimates suggest that the\nmost significant potential contributions are from geothermal heat pumps, solar\nPV and wind in that order? Geothermal power generation is less than % and\nlimited likely upside potential? Response: The total resource potential was one\nof the criteria used to choose RE projects for inclusion in the SREP IP (see\ntable  for the full set and scoring by technology) You are correct that\ngeothermal power has significantly lower assessed resource potential than wind\nand solar resources But this technology scored relatively high on the other\ncriteria used to prioritize technologies for inclusion in the SREP IP, and for\nthis reason it was included Furthermore, geothermal is  relatively unexplored\nresource in Armenia, and there very well might be more potential that is not\nknown about Because of the way that geothermal resource potential is evaluated\n(compared with wind and solar) only  small amount has been assessed at this\npoint, but there could be more potential that is not yet known about By funding\nexploration, SREP can help kick-start the process of identifying geothermal\nresources in Armenia 107  can\u2019 find much reference to the geothermal sources in\nArmenia (have requested your recent info/report); what  have found implied that\nthe resources may be very deep (6000m?) and modest temperature hot water \u2013 is\nthis what is currently understood? The cost / kWh for geothermal at full (LEC)\nrates is shown as around US$ Cents  (?) which looks low given the plant is\nsmall, first project, potentially lower temperature etc The report mentions that\nthis assumes  flash plant which would imply  high temperature (volcanic source)\nresource If  binary unit is considered then typically the costs will be higher\nIt may work with SREP underwriting for 40 years but this won\u2019 open up follow on\nIPP engagement unless heavy subsidisation is continued? Response: The emperature\nof the geothermal resource at Karkar site cannot be known for sure until\nexploratory drilling is done The comprehensive surface investigation works\nsuggest that there is geological anomaly, the site is geothermal in nature, and,\nthus, test drilling is warranted Please note that the geological studies suggest\nthat test wells with the depth of   are needed and not 6000  The resource could\nbe either  high-temperature resource ( at which  Flash plant could be deployed)\nOR  low temperature resource ( at which  binary plant could be deployed) If the\nKarkar site has  high temperature resource, then, according to an assessment\nconducted in 2012 (see the report attached), the Flash plant could have an LEC\nof around US$0864/kWh (under commercial financing terms) This assessment also\nevaluated the cost of  binary cycle plant, the LEC of energy will be\nsignificantly higher The only way to really find out the nature of the resource\nis to do test drilling, and this is why the first stage of the proposed\ngeothermal project under SREP involves exploratory drilling In looking at\ncomparative costs the Hzardan TPP is referenced; Table  shows that it has an\nexceptionally high tariff, between   and   of the average (incl/excl Hzaradan)\nCan you please explain why this has been chosen as the reference? If the current\naverage cots were the reference the picture for RE could look rather different\nResponse: The Hrazdan TPP is the marginal cost plant on the Armenian system, and\nit was included in the supply curves for comparison purposes, not as  threshold\nbelow which resources would be considered viable Also, please note that in\nFigure  we compare the cost of all renewable energy options to the 2012 average\ncost of generation (US$03/kWh), as you suggest To be clear: we did not use the\nHrazdan TPP to analyze the best renewable energy options, but rather show the\ncost of that resource just to demonstrate that many renewable energy options are\ncheaper than the current highest cost generating plant on the system Perhaps we\nshould add as reference points the lower-cost and more frequently used\ngeneration plants ( the new, efficient CCGTs) to the charts in the next draft of\nthe plan As before,  acknowledge  am coming in without the background on in-\ncountry visits and meetings and familiarity with the market but would expect\nothers to challenge the IP on this basis Overall the report appears to document\nthe situation quite well; however there is repeated reference to the difficulty\nin attracting IPP engagement in RE due to low pricing and this is not really\naddressed this? What (other expectations potential around risk) than the are as\n108 109 Independent Technical Reviewer: Mike Allen Comments delivered on April\n15th, 2014 (on  later draft of the Investment Plan) There are  number of issues\nwhich are obviously very pertinent to the potential of renewables in Armenia and\nthat should perhaps be reiterated:  The current cost for electricity is very low\n\u2013 \u201caverage cost of generation in Armenia is roughly US$ 035/kWh\u201d This is noted\nas having  significant impact on the opportunity to introduce new generation\ncapacity, whether renewable or conventional Response: The current cost of\nelectricity reflects that fact that several of Armenia\u2019 major power plants are\nfully depreciated and therefore do not have fixed charge in the tariff\nassociated with their capacity (in other words, the tariff reflects operating\nand maintenance costs only) As noted in the revised investment plan, this is\ngoing to change soon, as investment in  new thermal plant (nuclear or gas), and\nrehabilitation of existing plants, will increase tariffs substantially Gas\nimport prices are also forecast to continue to increase substantially, which\nwill drive up the cost of gas-fired generation in Armenia  The cost of renewable\noptions remain relatively expensive given the current cost/tariff structure for\nelectricity Response: As noted above, the average cost of generation in Armenia\nis likely to increase substantially in the coming years  The renewable options\nare important but not  significant portion of likely future generation capacity\nMedium term targets suggest small hydro has the most potential (380 MW) with\nwind, geothermal and PV offering only  combined 140MW The revised IP suggests\nthat the wind potential may be lower than earlier anticipated Response: The\ncurrent operational SHPP capacity is around 240 MW, so the SHPP capacity is\nexpected to increase by 140 MW by The Government targets for solar, geothermal\nand wind by 2020 are only 140 MW combined because: () the scale-up potential for\nwind is estimated to be lower than for solar and geothermal; thus, not much of\nwind capacity is expected to be developed; and () construction of geothermal\npower plant() is not likely to begin earlier than 2016 given the time needed for\nexploratory drilling to confirm the resource  It appears that geothermal heat\npump options have been removed from the IP; it is not clear why this has\noccurred Response: The geothermal heat pump, solar thermal and distributed\nthermal investments have been removed after government reconsidered, in\ndiscussion with development partners, its priorities and the likely availability\nof financing for such priorities Geothermal heat pumps, solar thermal heating\nand rooftop solar PV already have financing available through existing donor\nprograms and, therefore, were given lower priority than technologies, which did\nnot yet benefit from support  There is no additional information provided on the\ngeothermal status / recent reviews; on this basis my original recommendation\nwould stand that no drilling should be contemplated until an independent peer\nreview, by those who have significant geothermal 110 experience, has been\nundertaken There is mention of  review / planning for drilling but no detail has\nbeen provided Response: The IP was revised to clearly indicate that under the\nWorld Bank/GEF funded GeoFund : Armenia Geothermal Project several geo-technical\ninvestigation works were conducted for Karkar geothermal site and the\nresults/recommendations of those studies were independently reviewed  Table\nappears quite optimistic in terms of longer term scale up given the very limited\nexperience with most technologies to date in Armenia Response: It is true that\nthe targets reflect  faster pace of capacity growth than in the past, but\nGovernment has also now placed greater priority on the expansion of RE capacity\nthan in the past, highlighted by the recently adopted \u201cConcept on National\nEnergy Security\u201d for Armenia  As noted earlier, costs for new generation appear\nlow given the limited experience or first development situation with many of\nthem For geothermal the assumption of  high temperature resource appears\ncontrary to much of the dialogue in the report Response: The exact temperature\nof the resource at Karkar site cannot be known until the exploratory drilling is\nconducted and flow testing, chemical sampling and analyses is completed The\nsurface studies that were conducted for Karkar site and are described in the IP\nconcluded that two conceptual geothermal models or their combination might exist\nfor the Karkar site: Model : Model  assumes that low resistance is not present\nin the geothermal zones of interest In such  case, Model  would provide only for\ndiffuse source of heat and characterizes the field as  reservoir of moderately\nwarm waters (less than 100\u043e\u0421) Model : Model  assumes that low resistance may be\npresent in geothermal zones of interest In such  case, Model  would provide for\nlocalized high-temperature source of heat Along with this, some of the layers\ncould be characterized as  reservoir of high- temperature water (more than\n250\u043e\u0421)  The use of FITs needs to be very carefully considered as it implies\nongoing subsidy that has to be funded from central government if not passed in\npart or total to consumers Response: Agreed As noted in the revised investment\nplan, the Government is also considering\u2014for utility scale solar PV, in\nparticular\u2014 reverse auction approach to determining the appropriate level of\ntariff in order to minimize the cost to government and customers  The success of\nsmall scale hydro should be encouraged and supported as needed to ensure that\nthis sector does not suffer where other RE resources are being considered\nResponse: Agreed, but substantial financing already exists for small scale hydro\nfrom private banks (under-written by financing from development partners) In\nsum, the industry is already commercially viable It is the Government\u2019 view that\nsmall hydro capacity can continue to grow without additional concessional\nfinancing 111"}
