This work utilized the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) model which is an economic model generator for local, national, multi-regional, or global energy systems, developed and maintained under the auspices of the International Energy Agency\u2019s Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program, which provides a technology-rich basis for representing energy dynamics over a multi-period time horizon. The TIMES model platform provides an integrated energy system modelling tool designed to guide policy formulation over a wide range of energy, economic and environmental planning and policy issues, helping to establish investment priorities within a comprehensive framework. Key features of the TIMES platform include that it encompasses the entire energy system from resource extraction through to end-use demands; employs least-cost optimization to identify the most cost-effective pattern of resource use and technology deployment over time; provides a framework to evaluate medium- to long-term policies and programs that can impact the evolution of the energy system; and quantifies the costs and technology choices that result from imposing those policies and program. Thus, the TIMES platform is specifically a tool to develop and compare scenarios for future energy development and as such can be a productive tool to foster stakeholder buy-in and build consensus around energy sector policy. In order to adapt the generic TIMES model to become the TIMES-Armenia model, the SRIE team first established as a base year that period for which there was a complete set of data on production and consumption of all energy carriers used in Armenia - the energy balance. In addition, for the base year it was necessary to establish the energy production and consumption technologies in all sectors of the economy and to analyze and subdivide the initial volumes of energy among all available end-use technologies. When work on the current project was initiated in August 2018, the most recent year for which all relevant data for the Armenian economy and energy sector were available was 2016. This was selected as the base year. Having calibrated the model to confirm that its 2018 results matched available data, the first stage of the scenario- building process was to establish the initial Baseline (or Reference) scenario for the period planning period 2020 \u2013 2036. The Baseline Scenario The TIMES-Armenia modelling exercise started by imposing no constraints on the technology choice for future energy sector development. A key result of this exercise was to identify that expansion of variable renewable energy sources (VRES), in particular, solar and wind energy, are the clear least-cost sources for new generation capacity in Armenia, a clear reflection of the combination of Armenia\u2019s rich solar resource and trends in declining cost of solar power over the planning period. Given that the initial unconstrained level of projected VRES capacity in the baseline scenario was so high, adding nearly 3,000 MW of grid-connected solar and over 1,000 MW of wind power by 2036, it was clear that more reasonable levels of constrained expansion of VRES generation would be needed. Through expert consultation with stakeholders it was agreed that there was a need to reflect both potential limitations in the institutional capacity to build so much new solar and wind in the coming decades \u2013 which led to annual build-rate constraints - and in the need to ensure planning and 4 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV investment for any system strengthening that would be required to accommodate higher rates of VRES penetration in the total generation mix. This consultation process established that a reasonable and ambitious level of constrained maximum VRES capacity to be modelled would be 1,500 MW of solar and 500 MW of wind until the end of the planning horizon, along with limits on the annual build rates. When this set of added constraints was applied to the baseline model, the results established the Baseline Reference (BASE-R) Scenario. In this BASE-R scenario, which foresees closure of the Armenia Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP) from 2027 according to current planning - as was ultimately seen in all other scenarios as well - the full amount of constrained solar and wind capacity is added, reflecting the significant role of these VRES as the least-cost source of electricity for Armenia\u2019s development. While some additional hydropower capacity was also added in the BASE-R scenario, no other types of new generation are selected by the model, taking into account that the gas-fired Yerevan CCGT-2 TPP has already been included from 2022. The total required funding for new power plant construction in the BASE-R scenario is just under $1.9 billion over the entire planning period, while projected expenditures on imported natural gas fuel for electricity generation are $4.25 billion. The fact that the full constrained amount of solar and wind capacity is selected by the model as part of the least cost solution for new generation under all scenarios underscores the importance to Armenia of ensuring a policy and institutional environment that supports full realization of new VRES generation to the maximum extent practicable, not only to ensure the lowest cost generation but also to minimize reliance on other imported energy sources and to strengthen Armenia\u2019s energy security and competitiveness. GDP Growth Sensitivities in the Baseline Scenario Considering that GDP growth is a key main driver of energy demand growth, two sensitivity analyses for the BASE-R scenario were modelled to explore the impacts of higher and lower GDP growth rates on the least cost development pathway of Armenia\u2019s energy system. The particular cases analysed were for a 50% higher growth rate (i.e., 6.75% growth per year) and a 50% lower rate (i.e., 2.25% growth per year) as compared to the BASE-R scenario assumption of a 4.5% per annum GDP growth rate from 2022. While these higher (lower) growth rates had the expected impact in regard to increasing (decreasing) total system costs, total primary energy supply, final energy consumption and electricity generation, it was especially interesting to note that the higher GDP growth rate also reduced the share of total system cost in GDP, owing to the fact that it was accompanied by significant lowering of the energy intensity of a unit of GDP. In fact, the high-growth case of BASE-R projects an even lower level of total primary energy supply per unit of GDP than the scenario which explicitly pursued reduced final energy consumption through expanded energy efficiency. This enhanced efficiency was most clearly demonstrated in the fact that while overall GDP increases in total by 27% compared to the BASE-R scenario, total system costs increase only by 12% and total primary energy supply by 6.3%. This reflects the fact that aggregate purchases of new energy demand devices increase by almost 19%, which embeds higher levels of efficiency over time as incomes rise. USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 5 A surprising but crucial result from these sensitivity analyses is that the TIMES- Armenia model projects no differences in the projected total of new power plant capacities in level or by type required to cover electricity demand over the full range of GDP growth variation. While there are slight variations in the implementation schedule for new solar, wind and hydro power capacity, the only effect of higher (lower) income growth lies in the increased (decreased) utilization of existing installed capacity of both VRES and gas-fired thermal power plants, with a concomitant increase (decrease) in expenditures on natural gas fuel. Nuclear Scenarios Activities to extend the operational lifetime of the ANPP up to 2027 are already in place and in the BASE-R Scenario the plant was to be decommissioned from that time. While available nuclear technologies included in the TIMES-Armenia model were not selected in the BASE-R Scenario on the basis of least cost, the GOAM remains committed to a policy to maintain some nuclear power in the country\u2019s energy mix. To analyze the cost and other implications of these choices, four alternative scenarios for continued inclusion of nuclear generation in the Armenian power system were examined as: operating life extension of the ANPP for an additional 5 or 10 years after 2027; and forced implementation of a new nuclear unit, either with installed capacity 300 MW (Small Modular Reactor) or with installed capacity 600 MW (Light Water Reactor). The scenarios for life extension of the ANPP by 5 and 10 years decrease total system cost by around 1%, compared to eth BASE-R scenario, increase total primary energy supply by 3.7% and 7.3%, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions significantly by 4.5% and 9.3% and decrease imports of natural gas for electricity generation by 11.8% and 20.4%, respectively. A key feature of these scenarios is that they increase total investment costs for new power generation capacity 15.1% and 12.5%, compared the BASE-R scenario, with the higher investment costs needed for the longer extension being offset in its impact on total investment by the fact that in this scenario neither of the mid-sized HPPs (Shnokh and Loriberd) are built. The scenarios which propose new nuclear units to replace the ANPP from 2027 with either a 300 MW SMR or a 600 MW LWR increase total system cost by around 2%, increase primary energy supply by 3.3% and 7.8%, reduce GHG emissions by 7.1% and 12.2%, and decrease imports of natural gas for electricity generation by 7.2% and 15.5%, respectively. A key impact in these scenarios is that they significantly increase the required total investment costs for new power generation capacity compared the BASE-R scenario, more than doubling it to $4.1 billion (a 116% increase) for the 300 MW SMR unit and increasing it to over $5 billion (a 164% increase) for the 600 MW LWR unit. Thus, whether considering total system cost or investment costs required for new generation, the scenarios for life extension of the ANPP represent a least-cost policy choice for continuing to maintain nuclear capacity in Armenia\u2019 energy mix. It must be emphasized that such life extensions must first and foremost always ensure all measures required for the continued safe and reliable operation of these older plants. 6 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV As a final point, it is useful to note that the scenarios which imposed GHG emissions reduction targets to meet the level defined in Armenia\u2019s Nationally Determined Commitment, either by 2036 or earlier, largely mirror the \u201cnew nuclear\u201d scenarios in terms of increases in total system cost and primary energy supply, reductions in GHG emissions and decreases in imports of natural gas for electricity generation. This is not surprising, given that in these scenarios, with the constrained amounts of solar and wind VRES fully utilized, the next choice for lower GHG-emissions generation leads to selection of the new nuclear technologies, in this case introduction of 600 MW of nuclear power. Given the slightly different implementation patterns for introduction of nuclear units in these scenarios as compared to the forced implementation in 2027, the impact on total investment costs for new power generation capacity is even larger compared to the BASE-R scenario, ranging from $5.4 - $7.0 billion. Scenarios with Lower Prices for Imported Natural Gas The BASE-R scenario assumed that the natural gas price will increase up to projected European levels by 2027 (the year of ANPP decommissioning) and after that continue to match European levels. We also explored two scenarios with lower gas prices, starting from the same initial border gas price effective from January 1, 2019, of US$ 165 per 1000 m3 , which i) applied the EU trend growth rate over the entire period to 2036 from that starting point , and ii) assumed that the border gas prices grows to US$ 180/1000 m3 by 2027 and remains fixed at that level until the end of the planning period. These scenarios both show that if Russia continues to provide relatively low-cost natural gas to Armenia there will be a significant increase of natural gas consumption across all sectors, but mainly in electricity generation, transportation and residential heating. In both scenarios, the expanded use of existing gas-fired TPP capacity means that the mid-sized HPPs (Shnokh and Loriberd) are not built, while no additional thermal power capacity is required after the inclusion of Yerevan CCGT-2 (RENCO) and the closure of Hrazdan TPP. This results in a roughly 20% reduction in the lumpsum investment required for new generation in these scenarios as compared to the BASE-R scenario, the lowest in any scenarios. It is useful to note that the constrained levels of solar and wind generation are still fully built, which generates an investment cost saving as compared to BASE-R of $377 million in the case with the EU trend to 2036 and of $391 million when the gas price is capped at $180. In both scenarios there is an overall increase in total primary energy supply by 1 - 1.5%, because of increased use of the cheaper imported natural gas which is accompanied by a reduction in use of VRES. While total energy system cost is reduced when gas prices are lower, it is important to note that the increased utilization of cheaper gas maintains and deepens Armenia\u2019s dependence on imported energy. USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 7 Scenarios to Promote Fuel Switching to Electricity in Transport and Heating The most consumed fuel source in Armenia is and will continue to be imported natural gas, most of which is used for residential heating and transport. Since increased electricity generation based on development of Armenia\u2019s VRES is indicated as a least cost solution in the BASE-R scenario, and confirmed in all other scenarios, expanding use of these domestic energy resources could be accompanied by implementation of policies to stimulate use of electricity in the transport and residential sectors to replace natural gas imports. To explore these opportunities, we examined scenarios designed to increase the penetration level for use of electricity in residential heating to 25% in 2027 and to 50% by 2036, increase the penetration level for use of electric vehicles to 25% in 2027 and to 50% by 2036 and both of these scenarios taken together. Each of these scenarios proposing increased sectoral electricity penetration separately reduces total system cost (in combination by 3%), reduces total primary energy supply (again, in combination by 5%), lowers GHG emissions (by nearly 8%, in combination) and decreases imports of natural gas for electricity generation (in combination by 7.6%). Most importantly, no change in the overall level and type of new generation is required as compared to the BASE-R scenario in order to achieve these results, with only a negligible increase in lumpsum investment costs for new generation capacity associated with slight variations in the implementation schedule for projected additions of solar and wind power. The reduction in natural gas used for electricity generation shows clearly that a policy to promote increased deployment of electric for heating and electric vehicles will expand utilization of domestic VRES, reduce reliance on imported energy sources and strengthen Armenia\u2019s energy security. 8 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV 1. REPORT OVERVIEW AND DESCRIPTION OF THE ARMENIAN ENERGY SYSTEM IN THE MODELLING BASE YEAR 2016 1.1 REPORT OVERVIEW This Report presents the modelling framework, data, analyses and conclusions of the year-long activity undertaken by the Scientific Research Institute for Energy (SRIE), under sub-contract to Tetra Tech ES Inc. as the lead implementing partner for the USAID Market Liberalization and Energy Trade (MLET) Program, to prepare an update of the Armenia Least Cost Energy Development Plan (LCEDP) for the years 2020-2036. In order to adapt the generic TIMES model (see Chapter 2) so as to become the TIMES-Armenia model, it was necessary first to establish a base year (i.e., the first modelling year) for that period for which a complete set of data on production and consumption of all energy carriers used in the country - the energy balance - can be detailed. In addition, for the base year it is necessary to establish the energy production and consumption technologies in all sectors of the economy, and to analyze and subdivide the initial volumes of used energy among all available end-use technologies. When work on the current project was initiated in August 2018, the most recent year for which all relevant data for the Armenian economy and energy sector were available was 2016, so this year was selected as the base year. For all projections, dollar costs and expenditures are reported in terms of 2016 dollars. The remaining sections of this Chapter summarize a description of the Armenian energy system in the modelling base year of 2016. Chapter 2 presents a brief summary of the platform and methodology for the generic TIMES model, which is an economic model generator for local, national, multi-regional, or global energy systems, developed and maintained under the auspices of the International Energy Agency\u2019s Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program (IEA - ETSAP). This model provides a technology-rich basis for representing energy dynamics over a multi-period time horizon. Chapter 3 provides details on the specific application of the TIMES-Armenia model, confirming the calibration of the model to the year first modelled year (2018), confirming results to match available data, and presents the process of developing the initial Baseline (or Reference) scenario for the period planning period 2020 \u2013 2036. With the Baseline-Reference scenario fully detailed, Chapter 4 outlines a set of selected alternative possible scenarios that were identified by key stakeholders as of interest, to reflect different potential pathways for the evolution of the Armenian energy system, including policy choices as well as sensitivity analyses to determine the possible impacts of variations in such factors as demand growth or energy processes. This set of scenarios is intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive and to provide useful inputs to policy and strategy development for the energy sector in Armenia over the period to 2036. Once the results of the various scenarios have been described and the differences in outcomes explored, Chapter 5 presents a set of summary conclusions and recommendations based on those results. Detailed information on various aspects of the model and data used is presented in the Appendices. 1.2 ARMENIAN ELECTRICITY GENERATION, TRANSMISSION AND CONSUMPTION IN 2016 As summarized in Table 1.1, the total installed electricity generation capacity of the power system of Armenia in 2016 was approximately 3,267 MW, of which 2,710 MW was available, due to the conditions of aging of some plant and equipment, as well as of climate circumstances of the nuclear and thermal power plants USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 9 locations1. The installed capacity of thermal power plants (TPPs) was 1,532 MW and total available TPP capacity was 1,030 MW. TABLE 1.1: TOTAL INSTALLED AND AVAILABLE CAPACITY IN 2016, MW Plant Armenian Nuclear Power Plant Hrazdan Thermal Power Plan (TPP) Hrazdan Unit 5 TPP Yerevan Combined Cycle Gas Turbine Sevan-Hrazdan Hydro Power Plant (HPP) Cascade Vorotan HPP Cascade Small Hydropower Producers (<30 MW) Wind Farm TOTAL Total 440 810 480 242 560 404 328 2.64 3,267 Available 385 370 440 220 560 404 328 2.64 2,710 The first unit of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP) was put into operation in 1976 and the second unit in 1980. Two reactors of the type VVER-440 (V-270) were installed, with an aggregate capacity of 815 MW. Following the Spitak earthquake on December 7, 1988, operation of the ANPP stopped for safety considerations, although there was no technical damage to the plant. As a consequence of the severe energy crisis in Armenia during the years 1993-95, the ANPP Unit No. 2 was re-commissioned in 1995 with an installed capacity of 440 MW. In 2016, the available capacity of ANPP was 385 MW. The installed capacity of all hydropower plants (HPPs) in Armenia in 2016 was 1,293 MW, including 328 MW of small HPPs (size less than 30 MW). All the rivers of Armenia are in the Kura-Araks Basin, with 73.5% of the territory of Armenia in the Araks river basin. There are more than 200 rivers and streams in Armenia with a length of 10 km or more. The Hrazdan River, flowing out of Lake Sevan, and the Araks, Vorotan, and Debet Rivers have the most energy potential. According to the former Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources, the potential water energy resources of Armenia are 21.8 billion kWh, including 18.6 billion kWh from large and medium-sized rivers, and 3.2 billion kWh from small rivers. Armenia\u2019s hydropower resources are the country\u2019s most widely used renewable energy resource. The main hydropower generation units in Armenia in 2016 were: \uf0b7 Sevan-Hrazdan HPP Cascade: The cascade comprises seven HPPs: Sevan (34 MW); Hrazdan (81 MW); Argel (224 MW); Arzni (70 MW); Kanaker (102 MW); Yerevan-1 (44 MW); and Yerevan-3 (5 MW), with a total installed capacity of 560 MW and designed to produce up to 2.32 billion kWh annually. The HPPs are all located on the Hrazdan River and use irrigation water flow from Lake Sevan and other tributaries of the Hrazdan River. \uf0b7 Vorotan HPP Cascade: The cascade consists of three HPPs, all located on the Vorotan River in the territory of Syunik, which utilize both the river and stream waters. The cascade comprises Spandaryan HPP (76 MW), Shamb HPP (171 MW) and Tatev HPP (157 MW) with a total installed capacity of 404 MW and a designed annual electricity generation of 1.16 billion kWh. 1 The main reasons for lower availability of nuclear and thermal power plants against installed capacities relate to the relatively low atmospheric density resulting by the altitude above sea level and dry and hot summers in Armenia, which have an influence on efficiency of these types of power plants. 10 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV \uf0b7 Small HPPs: Construction of small HPPs in Armenia has been a leading factor in the development of renewable energy resources, enhancing the energy security of Armenia. The majority of small HPPs under construction or in operation are run-of-river facilities designed for natural water flows. As of January 1, 2017, electricity was generated by 173 small HPPs, with total 328 MW installed capacity. In 2016, the generation from small HPPs was around 937 million kWh, roughly 13% of total generation. In terms of other renewable energy resources, in 2016 Armenia\u2019s system also had one wind farm with a capacity of 2.64 MW and at the end of the year there were a small number of solar PV plants installed, with capacity of 273 kW and annual generation less than 0.1 million kWh Data on aggregate electricity generation and consumption in 2016 are presented in Table 1.2. It should be noted that total technical losses in the electricity grid, including transmission and distribution networks, was just over around 10%. There was also electricity trade both to north and to south.

Figure 1.2 presents the amount of electricity generated for domestic use in 2016, with difference reflecting the fact that net exports are generally accounted for by gas generation, which increases the share of nuclear generation and of all renewables to 37% each, leaving 26% of electricity generation for domestic use dependent on imported gas.

Historical electricity production, 1988 and 1996 - 2016, billion kWh The Armenian electricity transmission system is owned by the state company \u201cHigh Voltage Electrical Networks\u201d CJSC. In 2016, the total length of 220 kV and 110 kV High Voltage Lines (HVL) involved in electricity transmission was around 1,740 km (1,323 km of 220 kV HVL and 417 km of 110 kV HVL) and the number of substations was 33 (15 220 kV substations and 18 110 kV substations). The Armenia power system has interconnections with all neighbor countries, although those with Turkey and Azerbaijan were not in operation, due to political issues. Currently, construction of new 400 kV HVL both toward the North and the South is planned, which will expand opportunities both for exchange to neighboring power systems and to establish electricity transit among them. Electricity generated by power plants and transmitted by HVL reaches consumers through the distribution network, which comprises 110 \u2013 35 - 6(10) - 0.4 kV lines and cables. The number of distribution customers in 2016 was close to 985,000, all served by the sole distribution company \u201cElectric Networks of Armenia\u201d CJSC. The distribution network consisted of 2,778 km of lines and 102 substations at the 110 kV level; 2,307 km of overhead and 68 km of cable lines and 224 substations at the 35 kV level; and 20,917 km of overhead and 5,666 km of cable lines and 8,162 substations at the 6(10) and 0.4 kV levels. Figure 1.4 shows the share of electricity consumption by economic sectors in 2016, using the terminology for sectors of the Public Services Regulatory Commission (PSRC). Three sectors account for over 90% of electricity consumption, with \u201cPopulation\u201d (i.e., Residential) as the largest at 35% of the total, followed by \u201cOthers\u201d (comprising the Service/Commercial sector) at 30%, and Industry at 26%. The Transport sector only accounts for 2% of electricity consumption, although as will be seen it is a large consumer of final use energy. Clearly, in terms of understanding and projecting demand growth for electricity, these three sectors will be a key focus for in-depth modelling.

The overall gasification level in Armenia at 95% is nearly complete; this means that almost all consumers have access to the gas system. Notwithstanding this fact, many people especially in rural communities still use biomass (wood and/or manure) for heating, cooking and hot water. The underground gas storage facility in Abovyan, which has capacity of around 140 million cubic meters (m3), provides an opportunity to regulate daily load fluctuations in heavy demand periods such as winter days, as well as to accumulate some amount of gas to provide uninterrupted supply in emergency situations. Finally, it should be noted that gas imports from Russia are used for all domestic needs (including electricity generation), while gas imports from the south are primarily used for electricity generation in the context of the swap contract.

The bulk gas transportation system includes 1,682.2 km of main and branch gas pipelines, of which 1,586.5 km of gas pipelines are involved in gas transportation activities and the rest is in operational reserve mode. There are also 110 gas distribution stations; 21 metering units, including the Koghb gas measuring station on the Armenia-Georgia border; 181 electrochemical protection installations, including 166 cathodic 14 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV and 15 drainage systems. The Abovyan gas storage facility includes 21 underground tanks and compressor stations. The main operational indicators of the gas transportation system for 2016 are shown in Table 1.4. Combined losses in the gas transportation and distribution systems amounted to around 143 million m3; at roughly 6.4% of total imported gas volume these are high, but typical for former Soviet Union systems.

Gas consumption per sector in 2016, million m3, % 1.4 USE OF OTHER ENERGY CARRIERS IN 2016 Given that the TIMES model is a tool for optimizing all fuel and energy flows in a system, including production, transformation and consumption, it is necessary to analyze and incorporate all relevant data into the model. The best way to do this is to use the internationally approved country energy balance. This section presents the main data of the Armenian Energy Balance for the base year (2016), as officially published by International Energy Agency (IEA) (Source:  ource&mode=table&dataTable=BALANCES) Table 1.5 presents the Armenian Energy Balance for 2016, which includes also the amounts of other energy carriers used, in particular coal and oil. As with gas, practically all coal and oil products are imported from abroad (see Table 1.6). The cumulative share of those coal and oil products in Armenia\u2019s Energy Balance is less than 10% and they do not play a significant role in the country\u2019s economy. Almost three-quarters of oil products are used in transport, not only as fuel but also as lubricants. According to the IEA \u201cWorld energy balances, 2018 edition, Database documentation\u201d ( these flows are defined as follows: \uf0d8 Total primary energy supply (TPES) is made up of production + imports - exports - international marine bunkers - international aviation bunkers \u00b1 stock changes. \uf0d8 Transformation processes comprise the conversion of primary forms of energy to secondary and further transformation (e.g., coking coal to coke; crude oil to oil products; fuel oil to electricity). Inputs to transformation processes are shown as negative numbers and output from the process is shown as a positive number. Transformation losses will appear in the \u201ctotal\u201d column as negative numbers. \uf0d8 Energy industry own use covers the amount of fuels used by the energy producing industries (e.g., for heating, lighting and operation of all equipment used in the extraction process; for traction and for 16 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV distribution). It includes energy consumed by energy industries for heating, pumping, traction and lighting purposes. \uf0d8 Total Final Consumption (TFC) Is the sum of the consumption in end-use sectors and for non- energy use. Energy used for transformation processes and for own use of the energy producing industries is excluded. Final consumption reflects for the most part deliveries to consumers. Note that international aviation bunkers and international marine bunkers are not included in final consumption except for the world total, where they are reported as world aviation bunkers and world marine bunkers in transport. \uf0d8 Non-energy use covers those fuels that are used as raw materials in the different sectors and are not consumed as a fuel or transformed into another fuel. Non-energy use is shown separately in final consumption under the heading non-energy use. Note that for biofuels, only the amounts specifically used for energy purposes (a small part of the total) are included in the energy statistics. Therefore, the non-energy use of biomass is not taken into consideration, and the quantities are null by definition.

The base year data outline the leading position of households, which accounted for 37% of total FEC, with transport second at almost 30%. In the base year, services and industry accounted for 15.6% and 15.3% of FEC, respectively, while agriculture had the smallest share in total FEC at 2%.

Annual average consumer prices for petrol and diesel, 2016 1.6 ENERGY EFFICIENCY The TIMES model is well-suited to explore how developing scenarios on energy efficiency policy and adoption can play a role in Armenia\u2019s economy, creating conditions for economic growth while improving energy security. By reducing the energy intensity of economic output, energy efficiency is a key element in realizing a safe, sustainable and affordable energy supply, while meeting increasing energy demand and improving quality of life. Under existing conditions of extreme import dependence for fossil fuels, energy that Armenia\u2019s citizens, businesses, and infrastructure do not use is one of the cheapest, cleanest, and most secure energy resources. Government of Armenia policy is to promote energy efficiency in all economic sectors according to definitions formulated in the Law on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (2004), and as articulated in the National Program on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (2007), the Action Plan of Armenian Government for Implementation of National Program on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (2010), the President\u2019s Order on Approval of Armenian Energy Security Concept (2013), the Energy Security Action Plan for 2014-2020 (2014) and the Long-Term (up to 2036) Development Pathways of the Armenian Energy Sector (2015). Further, on February 2, 2017, Government of Armenia (GOAM) approved the Energy Efficiency Action Plan for 2017-2018. In 2016 amendments to Law on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy were approved by Parliament which included some specific minimum energy efficiency requirements. The amended Law in particular requested the Government to classify economic sectors by their energy intensity levels as high, medium and low and established mandatory energy efficiency and energy management technical requirements for newly- built residential apartment buildings and state-funded construction or re-construction. USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 23 The potential for energy efficiency in all sectors has been assessed repeatedly3,4,5,6,7 and remains high, despite the relatively low energy intensity of the economy. Although the GOAM has adopted laws and policies to promote efficiency through various programs as noted, the potential for efficiency improvement remains largely untapped. As energy prices rise, the urgency of accelerating uptake of energy efficiency throughout Armenia\u2019s economy has increased. Nevertheless, up to 2016 obligatory measures to increase energy efficiency and/or to reduce energy consumption levels had not been implemented, so that it was possible to model for the base year only the \u201cAutonomous efficiency improvement\u201d (AEI) factors, which have been introduced as follows: \uf0fc for Transport \u2013 0.75%/year, \uf0fc for Agriculture and Commercial \u2013 0.0%, \uf0fc for Industry \u2013 0.1%, and \uf0fc for Residential \u2013 0.01%. These factors show the percentage of efficiency improvement due to replacement of old equipment and devices by new ones of the same type, taking into consideration some reduction of efficiency of old equipment because of depreciation. The AEI factor is in force for the whole planning period. 2. THE INTEGRATED MARKAL - EFOM SYSTEM (TIMES) MODEL PLATFORM AND METHODOLOGY 2.1 THE GENERIC TIMES MODEL PLATFORM The TIMES model platform, a set of tools developed and maintained under the auspices of the IEA - ETSAP, is an economic model generator for local, national, multi-regional, or global energy systems, which provides a technology-rich basis for representing energy dynamics over a multi-period time horizon.8 The model is usually applied to the analysis of the entire energy sector, but it may also be applied to study single sectors, such as electricity and district heating. The TIMES platform provides an integrated energy systems\u2019 modelling framework that is designed to guide policy formulation over a wide range of energy, economic and environmental planning and policy issues and to help establish investment priorities within a comprehensive framework. Key aspects of TIMES platform include that it: i) encompasses an entire energy system from resource extraction through to end-use demands, as represented by a Reference Energy System network that connects 3 The first National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) for RA -  4 The Second NEEAP for RA -  fe41f3a0b9d3/EECG032016_ASE.pdf 5 Demand-side Management Report, Danish Energy Management A/S,2011 -  [Paper copy of report is available at SRIE] 6 UNDP/GEF: The Republic of Armenia TECHNOLOGY NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION, Reports I, II, III, 2016 -  7 UNDP/GEF: Lessons Learned Report1 \u201cArmenia \u2013 Improving Energy Efficiency of Municipal Heating and Hot Water Supply\u201d, 2012 -  /7300 8 Further information can be found at  24 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV all technologies to track to flow of commodities throughout the energy system, see Figure 2.1; ii) employs least-cost optimization to identify the most cost-effective pattern of resource use and technology deployment over time; iii) provides a framework for evaluation of medium- to long-term policies and programs that can impact the evolution of the energy system; and iv) quantifies the costs and technology choices that result from imposition of the policies and program. Utilizing the TIMES model can be a productive tool for fostering stakeholder buy-in and consensus building. Figure 2.1. A Simplified Generic Reference Energy System In adapting the generic TIMES model to a specific country use case, estimates of end-use energy service demands (e.g., car road travel; residential lighting; steam heat requirements in the paper industry; etc.) are provided by the user to drive the reference scenario. In addition, the user provides estimates of the existing stocks of energy-related equipment in all sectors and identifies assumptions relating to the characteristics of available future technologies and present and future sources of primary energy supply and their potentials. Using these as inputs, the TIMES model carries out its optimization to supply energy services at minimum global cost by simultaneously making decisions on equipment investment and operation; primary energy supply; and energy trade. For example, if there is an increase in residential lighting energy service relative to the reference scenario (perhaps due to a decline in the cost of residential lighting, or due to different assumptions on GDP growth), either existing generation equipment must be used more intensively, or new, possibly more efficient equipment must be installed. The choice by the model of the generation equipment (type and fuel) is based on the analysis of the characteristics of alternative generation technologies, on the economics of energy supply, and on environmental criteria. As shown in Figure 2.2, the TIMES model platform is a vertically integrated model of the entire extended energy system. USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 25 Figure 2.2. Energy System Models: Technology-Rich Representation Finally, it should be noted that in TIMES, as in its MARKAL model forerunner, the quantities and prices of the various commodities are assumed to be in equilibrium, i.e. prices and quantities in each time period are such that suppliers produce exactly the quantities demanded by consumers. Thus, this equilibrium has the property that total economic surplus is maximized. 2.2 DRIVING THE TIMES MODEL VIA SCENARIOS The TIMES model is particularly suited to explore possible energy futures based on contrasted scenarios. Given the long time-horizons that are typically simulated with the model, the scenario approach is the most effective choice (whereas for shorter time periods econometric methods may provide more useful projections). A scenario consists of a set of coherent assumptions about the future trajectories of the main drivers of the energy system, leading to a coherent organization of the system under study. In the TIMES platform, a complete scenario consists of four types of inputs: energy service demand curves, primary resource supply curves, a policy setting, and descriptions of a complete set of existing and available future technologies. 2.2.1 THE DEMAND COMPONENT OF A TIMES SCENARIO In the case of a country-specific version of the TIMES model, the main drivers are: Population, GDP, GDP per capita, number of households, and sectoral outputs. Once the drivers for a TIMES model are determined and 26 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV quantified the construction of the reference demand scenario requires computation of a set of energy service demands over the relevant planning time horizon. This is done by choosing and applying elasticities of demand to their respective drivers. As noted earlier, the demands are user-provided for the reference scenario only. When the model is run for alternate scenarios (e.g., an emission constrained case, or a set of alternate technological assumptions), it is likely that the demands will be affected. The TIMES model has the capability of estimating the response of demands to the changing conditions of an alternate scenario. To do this, the model requires an additional set of inputs for the assumed own-price elasticities of the demand. In this case, the TIMES model is then able to adjust the demands endogenously to the alternate cases without exogenous intervention; that is, the TIMES model is driven not by demands but by demand curves. 2.2.2 THE SUPPLY COMPONENT OF A TIMES SCENARIO The second constituent of a TIMES model scenario is a set of supply curves for primary energy and material resources. Multi-stepped supply curves are easily modeled in TIMES, each step representing a certain potential of the resource available at a particular cost. In some cases, the potential may be expressed as a cumulative potential over the model horizon (e.g. reserves of gas, crude oil, etc.), as a cumulative potential over the resource base (e.g. available areas for wind converters differentiated by velocities, available farmland for bio- crops, roof areas for PV installations) and in others as an annual potential (e.g. maximum extraction rates, or for renewable resources the available wind, biomass, or hydro potentials). Note that the supply component also includes the identification of trading possibilities, where the amounts and prices of the traded commodities are determined either endogenously or within user-imposed limits. 2.2.3 THE POLICY COMPONENT OF A TIMES SCENARIO Insofar as some policies impact the energy system, they become an integral part of scenario definition. For instance, a reference scenario may ignore emissions of various pollutants, while alternate policy scenarios may enforce emission restrictions, or emission taxes, etc. The detailed technological nature of the TIMES model allows for simulation of a wide variety of both micro measures (e.g. technology portfolios, or targeted subsidies to groups of technologies) and broader policy targets (such as a general carbon tax or permit trading system on air contaminants). A simpler example might be a nuclear policy that limits or expands the future capacity of nuclear plants. Another example might be the imposition of fuel taxes, or of targeted capital subsidies, etc. 2.2.4 THE TECHNO-ECONOMIC COMPONENT OF A TIMES SCENARIO The fourth constituent of a TIMES model scenario is the set of technical and economic parameters assumed for the transformation of primary resources into energy services. In the TIMES model, these techno-economic parameters are described in the form of technologies (or processes) that transform some commodities into others (fuels, materials, energy services, emissions). In the TIMES model, some technologies may be user imposed, while others may simply be available for the model to choose from. The quality of a TIMES model rests on a rich, well-developed set of technologies, both current and future, for the model to choose from. This emphasis on the technological database is one of the main distinguishing factors of the class of bottom-up models to which TIMES belongs. Other classes of models will tend to emphasize other aspects of the system (e.g. interactions with the rest of the economy) and may treat the technical system in a more succinct manner, e.g., via aggregate production functions. 2.3 THE TIMES-ARMENIA MODEL PLATFORM Following the generic process described above, as described in the following Chapter the TIMES-Armenia model incorporates the key inputs as presented in Table 2.1.

THE TIMES-ARMENIA MODEL AND ITS BASELINE-REFERENCE SCENARIO 3.1 SCENARIO MODELLING Having described the structure of the TIMES-Armenia model in the previous section, the model was then calibrated for the base year (2016), the first modelling year. The task of then assembling a view of the future Baseline Reference Scenario was undertaken starting with the preparation of the future demand projection, future fuel prices, the power sector presently, and the suite of demand-side options as discussed in the following sections. 3.1.1 KEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR DEMAND DRIVERS The key assumptions regarding the main drivers used to project future demand for energy services, income (as reflected by GDP) and population levels and growth rates, are shown in Table 3.1, below. TABLE 3.1: GDP AND POPULATION ANNUAL GROWTH RATES 2018 GDP*) 12,018 2036 26,617 Population**) 2,934.2 2,938.8 2,940.2 2,937.3 2,926.0 2,907.6 2,883.9 2,857.1 2030 20,439 2027 17,911 2024 15,695 2022 14,373 2033 23,325 2020 13,161 Persons per household GDP growth, % Population growth, % GDP per capita growth, % 3.55 4.50 0.02 4.47 *) International Monetary Fund data ( for forecast through 2020, which has been extended to the end of the planning horizon.

The same trend is assumed for the gas price at power plant input points (Figure 3.1, Orange line). Figure 3.1. Forecast natural gas prices 30 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV Prices for oil products and coal are forecast in accordance with European trends (IEA World Energy Outlook 2018), with a starting point from the real Armenian prices for 2016, corrected to 2018. It is assumed that the price of main oil products will increase around 123% by 2036, to reach the following levels: LPG, US$ 0.43/l; gasoline, US$ 0.987/l; diesel, US$ 1.049/; kerosene, US$ 1.437/l, aviation gasoline, US$ 1.261/l; and jet fuel, US$ 1.163/l. Nuclear fuel prices for modelled nuclear power plants are taken the same based on the special study results provided by the Ukrainian National Nuclear Electricity Generation Company Energoatom9. Finally, accounting for the current electricity-for-natural gas swap contract is a critical assumption. The swap contract calls for imports of gas from the South at no direct cost, but in exchange for electricity exports at a rate of 1 m3 of gas = 3 kWh of electricity. It is assumed that both the swap contract and net imports from Georgia are held constant at their 2018 levels through the end of the planning period (2036); i.e., net exports to South will amount to 1.52 TWh per annum, and net imports from Georgia will be 74.5 GWh p.a. 3.2.1 DEMAND PROJECTIONS FOR USEFUL ENERGY Demand projections in the TIMES model are developed for useful energy services; e.g., lighting, cooling, heating, food preparation, transportation of people and goods, etc.10 The fundamental TIMES model requirement is to meet projected levels of useful energy demand in all sectors and sub-sectors, choosing those fuels and technologies that do so at minimum costs for the total system. Useful energy demand is related to GDP or demographic parameters via elasticities. These elasticities represent how much useful energy growth depends on the growth in GDP, or in GDP per capita. Elasticities vary for different sectors and end-use applications and they have been analyzed from historical data available in the Yearbooks of the Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia and estimated using expert judgment. As the economy grows, the overall demand for energy will increase. Based on analyses of available retrospective statistical data and assumptions of the working team, end-use energy forecasts by sector were prepared. The structure of projected useful energy demand and its growth for 2018 \u2013 2036 is shown in Table 3.2 and illustrated in Figure 3.2.

Growth of Sector Useful Energy Demands (2018 \u2013 2036) The Residential sector accounts for the biggest share of useful energy demand in overall energy up to 2036, following by the Commercial sector, which in the last planning years is slightly less than the share of Residential (around 40% each). Agriculture accounts for less than 1% of useful energy demand, with Industry accounting for the remainder. It should be noted that all economic sectors increase in terms of their value of energy demand, with average annual growth rates ranging from 0.2% to 4.4%. The main demand drivers of demand growth for the Agriculture, Commercial, Industry and Freight transport sectors are GDP and sector elasticity to GDP growth. For the Residential and Passenger transportation sectors, the main drivers are GDP per capita and sector elasticity to GDP per capita growth. In addition, sector specific demand drivers were also applied, e.g., degree-days (for heating and cooling) in the Commercial sector, and Population and Changes in the number of new and existing houses for the Residential sector. The values of various elasticities have been established based on the general tends and expert opinion in working team decisions. In addition, the main sector-specific assumptions influencing projected growth of useful energy demand can be summarized as: \uf0b7 Agriculture: The small growth rate is expected due to low possibilities to expand agriculture. For this sector, the elasticity was taken as 0.2 for all demand types and for the entire planning period, as the result of low demand growth for electricity used for water pumping and tractors \uf0b7 Commercial: It is assumed that development of the Commercial (Service) sector will be based on broad development of hotels, restaurants, shops, etc. This is expected to result in relatively high growth of demand for space cooling and heating, lighting, cooking, etc. For this sector, the elasticity has taken as 0.6 for all demand types (space cooling, space heating, cocking, lighting, hot water and other appliances) and for the entire planning period. \uf0b7 Industry: It is assumed that the demand growth will be mainly driven by the Food & Tobacco sub-sector and by development of the non-metallic minerals sub-sector. The elasticity for these sectors has been taken as 0.9 for the entire planning period. This assumption was made based on the analysis of available Armenian energy balances for recent years and on industry data as presented in the Yearbooks of the Armenian Statistical Committee. ( 32 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV \uf0b7 Residential: Due to the projected slight decrease in population, the main demand driver, i.e., GDP per capita, still grows. In terms of the TIMES modelling logic, this means that living conditions will improve, which allows the population the possibility to buy more appliances, in addition to existing ones. More space in homes and apartments will be heated (e.g., a country-specific issue today is heating of part of flats/homes). Also, the number of people per household is projected to reduce, which means that the number of apartments would increase and more energy will be needed for space heating and cooling, lighting, etc. The model also includes other drivers which will lead to reduced energy consumption, such as the demolition rate of old buildings and replacement with more energy efficient new buildings, and internal improvement of appliances\u2019 efficiency, even when replacing the same one. All of these drivers are captured in the model and the results show that on net, consumption will increase. Two elasticities have been defined for Residential sector: That for space heating, space cooling, hot water preparation is assumed at 0.4; and that for cooking and other appliances at 0.2. \uf0b7 Transport: It is assumed that the growth of the population\u2019s standard of living, combined with Commercial sector development will require more differentiated types of passenger and freight vehicles, which will result in growth of Transportation end use energy demand. Sector elasticities for buses are distributed through the planning period, dropping from 1.3 in 2018 to 0.25 in 2036. For passenger carrying international aviation, the elasticity is kept constant at 0.51. For heavy-duty vehicles, cargo international aviation, and commercial trucks the elasticities will decrease from 1.1 to 0.95. For rail passenger transportation the sector elasticity is set at 0.64, and for freight rail transportation at 0.5. 3.2 EXISTING ELECTRICITY GENERATION FACILITIES Table 3.3 describes the relevant and economic parameters for existing power plants included in the TIMES- Armenia model.

For existing power plants, variable and fixed O&M costs are based on 2018 data for the tariff structure as provided by the Public Services Regulatory Commission (PSRC). For model purposes, fuel costs that are included in PSRC tariff calculations have been removed and variable cost recalculated in accordance with modeling requirements. Finally, it should again be noted that TIMES-Armenia model has been calibrated for 2018 using the available baseline year data for 2016. In the first quarter of 2019, the PSRC monthly data on electricity generation, electricity and natural gas transmission, export, import and sectoral distribution of consumption for 2018 became available. Using these data, existing power plant characteristics were checked and adjusted to bring the calculation results in line with actual results. These also provide the corrected starting point for calculations over the full forecast period through 2036. 3.3 CANDIDATE ELECTRICITY GENERATION FACILITIES In addition to existing generation capacities that are and will be available in the system over the planning horizon to 2036, Tables 3.4 and 3.5 below describe the candidate technologies that are included in the TIMES- Armenia model, including seasonal capacity factor for variable renewable energy sources (VRES). Detailed background on the data sources and assumptions are presented in Appendix 2. Investment costs in this table reflect the possible changes in costs for any given technology over time, so that a constant value means that no changes in costs are foreseen for the planning horizon. Discount and interest rates are considered in TIMES Armenia model and used during the calculations.

For the Initial Unconstrained Baseline (IU BASE) Scenario, no one activity is forced and the tool itself chooses the most economically attractive demand technologies to be implemented in the system. The model contains an extensive database with different types of demand technologies, presented as \u201cStandard\u201d, \u201cImproved\u201d, \u201cBest\u201d and \u201cAdvanced\u201d. The main parameters describing each technology are cost, efficiency and the initial year within the planning horizon when such technology could be available, as well as fuel type used. Depending on the whole system cost calculated for each milestone period, as well as for entire planning horizon, and based on the costs for supplied energy carriers, the TIMES model chooses the least cost demand 11 12 13 14 15 16 Update to the Economic and Financial Appraisal of the Potential Geothermal Power Plant at Karkar Report on Hydropower Project Input Evaluation.

In the IU BASE scenario, the rate of penetration of Improved/Better/Advanced devices is limited to 17.5% by the end of the planning horizon. Because the Government of Armenia has not yet put in place any obligatory requirements for implementation of energy efficiency activities, the market uptake of Improved, Better and Advanced technologies is constrained. The common assumption on the upper limit of \u201cImproved\u201d technologies for Agriculture, Commercial, Industry and Residential sectors is 10%. In addition, the Agriculture sector is allowed to change existing technologies by \u201cBest\u201d (10%) and \u201cAdvanced\u201d (10%), the Commercial sector by \u201cAdvanced\u201d (2.5%), and the Residential sector by \u201cBest\u201d (5%) and \u201cAdvanced\u201d (2.5%). For the Industrial sector neither \u201cBest\u201d nor \u201cAdvanced\u201d technologies are allowed, while for the Transport sector, implementation of all new technologies types are limited to 10%, based on the relatively limited retrospective data available for Armenia, combined with expert review and judgement of available experience by the DWG and SRIE team. 3.5 MAIN ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE INITIAL UNCONSTRAINED BASELINE SCENARIO Summarizing the key model assumptions as detailed in the sections above, we note in particular: \uf0b7 GDP growth is assumed constant after 2022, at the level of 4.5% per year (sensitivities to higher or lower rates will be examined in subsequent scenarios); \uf0b7 While population is assumed to have a small negative growth rate, thus slightly decreasing over the planning period, residential demand for useful energy still grows on average by 1.7% annually; \uf0b7 The commercial sector is the main contributor to demand for useful energy, with average annual growth of over 4.4%; \uf0b7 The agriculture and industrial sectors contribute less to the growth of demand for useful energy, with average annual growth rates of around 0.2% and 2.2%, respectively; \uf0b7 The gas price is assumed to increase, reaching the European prices level in 2027 (US$ 299/1000 m3) and growing at the same rate thereafter; \uf0b7 Electricity losses are assumed to maintain a total of 8.2% for transmission and distribution systems; \uf0b7 Net electricity exports to South are held constant at the 2018 level (1,515.2 GWh) for the planning horizon; net electricity imports from Georgia and from Artsakhenergo are assumed to remain unchanged at their 2018 levels, 74.5 GWh and 17.2 GWh respectively, for the planning horizon; \uf0b7 Both the Yerevan CCGT2 (RENCO) thermal plant and the Masrik-1 grid connected solar PV plant, which are already financed and have set Commercial Operation Dates are introduced in the system at those dates; and \uf0b7 No other technical limitations are imposed on the introduction of new power generation candidate technologies in the system for the planning horizon. 3.6 SUMMARY RESULTS OF INITIAL UNCONSTRAINED BASELINE SCENARIO The following discussion summarizes the main findings of the TIMES-Armenia initial model Baseline Scenario calculation results, in which no further constraints than those noted above have been introduced. It is useful to reiterate that the purpose of this exercise is to provide a starting point and framework for further analysis, focused on the sole criterion of least cost entry of new generation in the system to ensure that projected demand is met. Based on the results of this scenario, further adjustments may be made before examining a series of practical scenarios and sensitivities that will be developed in order to provide inputs for policy and planning considerations for Armenia\u2019s energy sector. Starting with the projection of main energy sources over the planning time horizon, presented in Table 3.6, we see that natural gas remains by far the dominant source, with its share in Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES), 36 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV staying at around 58% in the period following the exit from the system of the ANPP in 2027, having declined to just under 50% in the period around 2024. Nuclear energy remains a significant supply source, accounting for up to 25% of TPES, until the ANPP exits from the system. Renewable energy sources increase dramatically over the planning period, rising from around 6% of TPES to 24%. The share of oil products in TPES rises slightly from 10% to 12 % over the planning period.

The results, presented in Table 3.7, indicate that at the end of planning period, the gas supply level from Russia will be just under 55% of maximum capacity of pipeline. TABLE 3.7: ARMENIA GAS PIPELINE CAPACITIES Gas Pipeline Maximum capacity, billion m3 From Russia Iran-Armenia Total Daily 0.010 0.008 0.018 Annual 3.65 2.30 5.95 Import, billion m3 2018 1.94 0.52 2.46 2036 1.93 0.52 2.45 The final energy consumption (FEC) by sectors and fuel types is presented in Table 3.8. As can be seen, the main energy source consumed for the Agriculture sector, which accounts for less than 2% of total FEC, is oil products, remaining around 77% throughout the planning period. For the Commercial sector, whose share of total FEC rises from 16% to over 20% over the planning period, the main sources of energy consumed are natural gas and electricity; the former covering 57% and the latter 42% of sectoral demand respectively, with a slight shift over the planning period from gas to electricity. In the Industry sector, whose share of total FEC rises very slightly from just under 15% to just over 16% over the planning period, the main sources of energy consumed are again natural gas and electricity; the former accounting for 50% and the latter 43% of sector demand respectively, here with a slight shift over the planning period from electricity to gas. The main sources of final energy consumption in the Residential sector are natural gas, electricity, and biofuels, accounting for around 63%, 19% and 18%, respectively, with very slight shifts over the planning period away from gas and biofuels and toward electricity. Finally, in the Transport sector, FEC is almost entirely split between natural gas USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 37 and oil products, the former accounting for 59% and the latter 40%, respectively, with a slight decrease in the share of natural gas over the planning period given a small increase in electricity use in the sector.

The total discounted costs cumulated here comprise all costs associated with both the supply of energy and with the end-use demands for energy across all five sectors of the model, i.e., Agriculture, Commercial, Industry, Residential, and Transport. For example, in the Investment category the model methodology includes not only the spending required to build new power plants or new industrial facilities, but also the costs associated with replacing existing facilities, and further includes spending on such end-use energy items as new or replacement electrical appliances, heating/cooling devices, cars and trucks, and industrial and agricultural equipment, among others. Similarly, for each final energy consumption sector, the variable and fixed operation and maintenance costs include all costs, excluding fuel, 38 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV required to ensure safe and uninterrupted operation of all the technologies and installations not only in the supply, transmission and distribution systems, but also for all consumer (demand) needs.

In addition to existing generation units, this scenario includes the introduction of the RENCO gas-fired CCGT and the Masrik-1 solar PV power plants according to their scheduled Commercial Operation Dates, and also forces the decommissioning of the ANPP and Hrazdan TPP at the end of their current operational lifetimes, 2027 and 2021, respectively. In this Least-Cost Baseline, with no other limitations on choice of technology, by the end of planning period the model results show an added capacity of 2,931 MW of grid-connected Solar PV, 1,091 MW of Wind Farms and 107 MW of added Small HPPs. The quantity of electricity generation by each technology or plant (in GWh) over the planning period is presented in Table 3.10. These results show clearly that, taken from a cost perspective only and leaving aside any other possible technical constraints, extensive implementation of grid-connected solar PVs along with wind farms (Variable Renewable Energy Sources \u2013 VRES) are economically the most attractive sources of new electricity generation over the period to 2036. As a practical matter, planning for and realizing such extensive growth of VRES could clearly create operational challenges for the electricity system. As large amounts of new grid connected VRESs are introduced, the model shows a decline in production of Small HPPs, which are almost exclusively run-of- river. This is driven in part by the fact of maximum solar generation during summer time (especially in June), when large amounts of hydro generation are also available, although the model limits generation by these Small HPPs at these times as higher cost. In the winter, when power system peak is in the evening and solar is not producing, the compensating generation cannot be from Small HPPs but is rather met by operation at full capacities of the RENCO and Yerevan CCGT plants. Given system operational constraints of having such large amounts of VRES on the system from solar PV, this could imply the need for implementation of storage technologies, although these are available and are not among the selected least-cost solutions. Another possible approach to overcome potential system stability problems would be to limit annual construction of grid- connected solar PV plants. In fact, we explore this in the next case, which describes our proposed Baseline - Reference Scenario. 40 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV Summarizing the Initial Unconstrained Baseline (IU BASE) Scenario, Figures 3.4 and 3.5 show the pattern of new generation added to the system by type and the associated total lumpsum projected investment expenditures over the planning period, which amounts to roughly US $3.17 billion to add around 4,409 MW of capacity.17 After decommissioning of the ANPP in 2027, the model indicates the power system should build around 1,091 MW of new power capacities to cover the gap of electricity production, which is added from wind farms as the lowest cost technology at that time with average annual capacity factor (0.31) suitable to cover about 340 W of the lost base load capacity and match system load needs. During the last three planning periods a further 1,283 MW of generation capacity is added to cover the growth of demand, which the model adds through the addition of Solar PV as the least cost alternative.

This is a result of the modelling assumption that forces them into the system at current CODs, so that their investment costs are essentially treated as sunk costs in the same way as existing generation plants.

Total Power Sector Investment 3.7 BASELINE-REFERENCE SCENARIO (BASE-R) WITH LIMITATION OF VRES Results of the Initial Unconstrained Baseline (IU BASE) Scenario clearly highlighted the cost-based preference for significant implementation of grid-connected wind and solar PV generation. At the same time, such a substantial expansion also raises questions of the required further analysis of system technical issues associated with adding very large amounts of VRES, e.g., system stability and dispatching issues, as well as of ensuring realistic time frames for development of those resources and the availability of domestic capacity to do so at such large scale. While these issues suggest that it could be reasonable to look at more limited expansion of VRES, there are also significant benefits for domestic energy security that would arise from displacing imported gas or nuclear fuels with VRES and which in turn would suggest that renewable generation expansion should be promoted as much as practically possible. To reflect these aspects of concern, the following scenario, which we develop as the Baseline-Reference Scenario (BASE-R), imposes a certain limitation on grid-connected solar PV and wind generation expansion. In particular, the following sections develop the BASE-R Scenario in which total VRES development is capped at 2,000 MW, of which grid-connected solar PV can be at maximum 1,500 MW over the planning period and wind generation at 500 MW. Based on wide discussion with Armenian solar experts it was assumed that construction capacities would be limited to around 100 MW per annum, which would imply around 1,600 MW over the planning horizon 16 years. As a practical matter, based on current construction tendencies it was decided to impose the limit at 1,500 MW over the planning horizon. Once we have compared this BASE-R Scenario to the IU BASE Scenario presented in the previous section, in Chapter 4 we will then proceed to use the BASE-R Scenario as the point of comparison for examining further the alternate policy scenarios that have been identified by key sector stakeholders as of interest in looking to reshape the evolution of the Armenian energy system. 3.7.1 MAIN ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE BASELINE-REFERENCE (BASE-R) SCENARIO The BASE-R Scenario maintains the same assumptions regarding key demand drivers and hence the same projected growth of sectoral demands for useful energy as in the IU BASE Scenario (Section 3.5 above); it also 42 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV retains the same assumptions related to gas prices, electricity losses, net exports, energy efficiency adoption rates and inclusion of Yerevan CCGT2 and Masrik-1. In addition, the BASE-R Scenario introduces the following assumptions related to limiting VRES deployment over the period from 2020-2036: \uf0b7 Introduction of new VRES generation capacity is limited to 1.5 GW for solar PV (central and decentralized) and 0.5 GW of wind. \uf0b7 Annual maximum new capacity additions are capped at 100 MW for central solar PV, 4/5 MW for Residential/Commercial rooftop PV, and 50 MW for wind. \uf0b7 No other technical limitations are imposed on the introduction of new power generation candidate technologies in the system for the planning horizon. 3.7.2 SUMMARY OF BASE-R SCENARIO RESULTS Starting again with the projection of main energy sources over the planning time horizon, Table 3.11 shows that natural gas remains by far the dominant source, with its share in TPES at around 68% in the period following the exit from the system of the ANPP in 2027, having declined to 50% prior to that period. In fact, compared to the IU BASE Scenario, gas increases its share of TPES by about 10% after 2027 and its amount by around 25% as a result of limiting VRES builds. In the BASE-R Scenario, RES increases around two and a half times over the planning period, with its share rising from 6.6% of TPES to nearly 16% by 2030, as the new generation reaches its assumption-allowed limits. No other sources of primary energy supply show significant changes from the IU BASE scenario.

The results indicate that by the end of planning period, the gas imports from Russia would increase to 2.58 billion m3 or just under 71% of maximum capacity of pipeline (see Table 3.7 above). USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 43 The FEC distributed by sectors and fuel types is presented in Table 3.12, which shows no significant changes when compared to the FEC in the IU BASE Scenario (Table 3.8 above). Figure 3.6 presents the net present value of the sum of all costs, as projected by the model, that are associated with ensuring development and operation of Armenia\u2019s energy system to meet the projected energy consumption over the period to 2036, as total of US $41.0 billion, which is higher than Base case without renewables limitation by US$ 512 M, an increase of 1.3%. As noted earlier in the discussion of Figure 3.3, these projected costs comprise all costs associated with supply of energy, generation of electricity and with the end- use demands for energy across all five sectors of the model, i.e., Agriculture, Commercial, Industry, Residential, and Transport. As shown in Table 3.13, which summarizes the levels and changes in total discounted system development costs between the IU BASE Scenario and the Baseline-Reference Scenario, in fact the 2% overall increase in costs associated with the imposed limitation on VRES generation expansion masks a 2.9% decrease in investment costs and a 10.4% increase in fuel costs, largely associated with the increased use of gas.

As noted earlier, in addition to existing generation units, this scenario includes the introduction of the RENCO gas-fired Yerevan CCGT2 and the Masrik-1 solar PV power plants according to their scheduled Commercial Operation Dates and also forces the decommissioning of the ANPP and Hrazdan TPP at the end of their current operational lifetimes, 2027 and 2021, respectively. In addition, the limitation of VRES to 1.5 GW of Solar PV and 0.5 GW of Wind farms is in force. USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 45 In the BASE-R scenario, by the end of planning period the model results show an added capacity of grid- connected Solar PV and Wind Farms near their upper permissible levels, with 1,500 MW of all types of solar PV and 503 MW of wind, as well as 107 MW of new Small HPPs (against the existing 328 MW; see Table 3.3 above), plus 75 MW of medium-size hydropower from the Shnokh HPP (from 2027) and finally at the end of the planning period of the 66 MW Loriberd HPP. Both of these last-named HPPs represent the next cheapest generation technologies following solar and wind. It is useful to note again that in finding the least-cost solution, the TIMES-Armenia model takes into consideration not only the associated costs, but also efficiencies and availability factors for these HPPs.

As the limited amounts of new VRES are introduced, the model shows relatively stable generation by most of the other power plants. Only generation at RENCO CCGT declines slightly between 2020 and 2024, while generation of Hrazdan 5 TPP is needed only in a relatively small amount at the end of planning period. Figures 3.7 and 3.8 show the pattern of new generation added to the system by type and the associated total lumpsum projected investment expenditures over the planning period, which amounts to roughly US $1.89 billion for 2,457 MW of added capacity. In the period of decommissioning the ANPP in 2027, the model indicates the power system should add around 540 MW of new power capacity to cover the gap of electricity generation, which is added from the lowest cost technologies at that time - Solar PV (300 MW), wind farm (150 MW) and medium-sized Shnokh HPP (75 MW). During the last three planning periods to 2036, an additional 875 MW of generation capacity is added to cover the growth of demand; again, this comprises new VRES investment in Solar PV (714 MW), wind farms (95 MW) and the medium-sized Loriberd HPP (66 M).

Comparison of Total Lumpsum Investment in New Power Generation, US$ M USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 49 As shown in Figure 3.10, the assumed limitation on implementing new generation from VRES reduces the overall total (undiscounted) lumpsum level of investment in new generation by 40%, from US$3,170 million to US$ 1,891, which is the combined result of the much-reduced level of solar PV and wind investment, offset partly by the increased HPP investments and higher utilization of the existing gas-fired thermal generation. Thus, the reduced new generation investment funding need of US$ 1,279 million is also associated with significantly higher fuel expenditures. As the limited implementation of VRES results in additional natural gas demand of roughly 26.5% relative to IU BASE by 2036, this amounts to an additional total of approximately 7.62 billion m3 of gas over the planning period, which would be the assumed gas prices require an additional (undiscounted) US$ 2.36 billion.18 4. SELECTED SCENARIOS FOR THE ARMENIAN ENERGY SYSTEM: 2020-2036 This Chapter provides a summary of key results in comparing the Baseline-Reference (BASE-R) Scenario with a set of alternative scenarios identified as of interest by key sector stakeholders. Full detailed outputs for each Scenario are presented in Annex 4. 4.1 GDP GROWTH SENSITIVITY ANALYSES 4.1.1 SENSITIVITY ANALYSES DESCRIPTION The BASE-R scenario assumed that GDP growth will stay constant after 2022, at the level of 4.5% per year. Taking into consideration that GDP is the main driver of demand growth, two sensitivity scenarios have been modeled to analyze the influence of different GDP growth rates on the Armenian energy system\u2019s least cost development pathway. In particular, the cases of a 50% higher growth rate (6.75% per year) and a 50% lower rate (2.25% per year) have been analyzed. Figure 4.1 below shows the modelled levels of GDP for each milestone year at the three growth rate levels. 18 To calculate gas volumes between milestone years, the same interpolation rules were applied as for modelling the supply sector, i.e., that changes in natural gas supply will be ensured only by the Russian pipeline. Therefore, the Russian gas conversion factor of 34.88 TJ/million m3 has been used. 50 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV GDP growths 39.1 26.6 20.5 32.1 23.3 18.8 26.4 20.4 17.2 21.7 17.9 15.7 12.0 12.0 12.0 13.8 13.2 12.8 15.7 14.4 13.6 17.9 15.7 14.4 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 2018 2020 2022 2024 2027 2030 2033 2036 GDP GDP +50% GDP -50% Figure 4.1. GDP Growth Scenarios: GDP at Growth Rates +/- 50% compared to BASE-R 4.1.2 GDP GROWTH SENSITIVITY RESULTS As anticipated, Table 4.1 shows that total system costs are estimated to increase by around 12.2% in the case with a 50% higher GDP growth rate and to decrease by 7.0% in scenario with a 50% lower GDP growth rate as compared to the BASE-R scenario. With higher GDP growth reflecting broader development of the economy at large, this results in an increase of energy use to cover the enlarged demand. It is interesting to note that while the higher rate of GDP growth leads to an overall level of GDP nearly 47% higher than in the BASE-R scenario, energy system costs increases by a significantly lower percentage. Similarly, while the lower level of GDP growth leads to lower energy system total costs, the reduction of 7% is less than the overall decrease in GDP of 23% compared to BASE-R. TABLE 4.1: GDP GROWTH SCENARIOS: TOTAL SYSTEM COSTS Scenario BASE-R +50% GDP compared with BASE-R -50% GDP compared with BASE-R System Cost 2015$M % Difference 41,029 46,017 38,153 12.2% -7.0% As shown in Table 4.2 below, in case with a 50% higher GDP growth rate, the overall increase in TPES is 6.3%, which is largely due to the additional use of imported natural gas as compared to BASE-R by around 138 PJ (roughly 4.0 billion m3), followed by oil products at around 52 PJ, and by RES reaching 7 PJ over the entire planning period. Again, as with total system costs, this increase in TPES is significantly lower than the overall USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 51 increase in GDP, indicating a reduced energy intensity of economic activity. In case of a 50% lower rate of GDP growth, reduced demand results in less use of imported natural gas by 83 PJ (around 2.4 billion m3), of oil products by 29 PJ and of RES by nearly 3 PJ as compared to the BASE-R scenario, again with TPES declining in percentage terms by less than the overall decrease in GDP. Figure 4.2 below illustrates the changes in composition of TPES as compared to the BASE-R scenario for each of the GDP growth scenarios.

GDP Growth Scenarios: Comparison of TPES with BASE-R (TJ) As shown in Table 4.3 below, the higher GDP growth rate results in an increase of FEC by 7.5%, slightly higher than in the growth of TPES. Referring to the more detailed outputs of the TIMES Armenia model, the data show that the higher income growth in fact creates possibilities to use more efficient and more expensive technologies on the demand side. This is also seen from Table 4.4, where the amount of money spent to purchase demand devices increases by almost 19% in comparison with BASE-R scenario. It is useful to note that the significant growth of FEC is driven by increased use of gas and oil products to meet increased demand in the Transport and Residential sectors.

The key finding of this sensitivity analysis is that there are no differences in total new power plant capacities by type required to cover electricity demand between the two GDP growth scenarios as compared to the BASE-R scenario, with only the implementation schedule for new solar, wind and hydro being very slightly different depending on the required consumption level in each time period. Thus, there is virtually no impact as well on the investment requirement for new electricity generation capacity as compared to the BASE-R scenario. The only effect of higher income growth lies in the increased (decreased) utilization of existing installed capacity of both RES and gas-fired thermal power plants, with a concomitant increase (decrease) in expenditures on natural gas fuel. Given this key result, no further detailed sensitivity analyses of the impacts of higher and lower growth rates is reported for other scenarios. 4.2 NUCLEAR DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS 4.2.1 SCENARIOS DESCRIPTION Activities to extend the operational lifetime of the ANPP up to 2027 are already in place and the plant was included in the BASE-R Scenario to be decommissioned from that time. Given that the available nuclear technologies included in the TIMES-Armenia model were not selected on the basis of least cost in the BASE-R 58 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV Scenario and that the GOAM as a matter of policy remains committed to maintain some nuclear power in the country\u2019s energy mix, the following alternatives for continued inclusion of nuclear generation in the Armenia system are examined: a) Forced implementation of a new nuclear plant upon ANPP decommissioning, in particular: \uf0b7 Forced implementation of a new nuclear unit with installed capacity 300 MW (Small Modular Reactor - SMR); and \uf0b7 Forced implementation of a new nuclear unit with installed capacity 600 MW. b) Further life extension of ANPP, in line with international experience and ensuring all required safety upgrades (e.g., in the U.S. extension of NPPs lifetime this could be as long as 80 years ( life-to-80-years), in particular: \uf0b7 Operating life extension of the ANPP for an additional 5 years after 2027 - up to 2032, with $300 million of additional investment; and \uf0b7 Operating life extension of the ANPP for an additional 10 years after 2027 - up to 2037, with$600 million of additional investment. Thus, four (4) Nuclear Scenarios have been developed starting from the BASE-R Scenario and for each of them one of the above forced options has been allowed. 4.2.2 NUCLEAR SCENARIO RESULTS As shown in Table 4.9, life extension of the ANPP to 2032 reduces total energy system cost19 by 0.8%, while extension to 2037 reduces it by 1.2%, principally through reduced use of imported natural gas and the fact that additional investment costs for new generation are reduced. Forcing the build of new nuclear plants increases overall energy system costs compared to BASE-R by from 1.9 \u2013 2.0%, depending on the size of new reactor, where savings associated with reduced fuel costs are more than offset by the higher costs for the new nuclear units which are built.

These projected costs comprise all costs associated with both the supply of energy and with the end-use demands for energy across all five sectors of the model.

Figure 4.8. Nuclear Scenarios, Comparison of Total Primary Energy Supply Figure 4.8 above shows how the development of the various nuclear options from 2027 will replace other energy sources, primarily imported gas and to a lesser extent RES.20 The data in Table 4.10 below indicate that in all the nuclear scenarios there is an overall increase in TPES21. Because part of the calculation of TPES starts from electricity produced and works backward to fuel used, the fact that NPP efficiency is around 33% means that the forced production of additional nuclear power electricity generation as compared to BASE-R is replacing the gas used in CCGTs, which have an efficiency of around 56%. A further factor contributing to the increase in TPES in these scenarios is that some of the extra electricity replaces gas used directly in demand side devices that have efficiencies more than 60%. TABLE 4.10: NUCLEAR SCENARIOS, PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLIES Scenario BASE-R ANPP Life Extension to 2032 ANPP Life Extension to 2037 New nuclear - SMR 300 MW New nuclear - LWR 600 MW Primary Energy PJ 3,140 3,257 3,370 3,245 3,385 % Difference 3.7% 7.3% 3.3% 7.8% 20 Because the TIMES least-cost optimization is performed covering the entire planning horizon, given that there is more forced nuclear generation available after 2027 in these scenarios it is also economically more attractive to have a slight reduction in the implementation of renewables prior to 2027; this leads to the noted small increase in use of natural gas for generation to cover this gap as compared to BASE-R scenario. 21 The figures in the table at the bottom of Figure 4.8 present average values for the relevant milestone period. Thus, here and hereafter all the cumulative value for the entire planning horizon is calculated by summing the results of the product of these numbers by the length of the period between milestone years. Specifically, each number presented for 2020-2024 should multiplied by 2 (years) and in 2027-2036 by 3 (years) to obtain the calculated total value of the selected parameter over the planning period. 60 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV As a final initial summary point, the comparisons in Table 4.11 below indicate that there is no significant change in overall final energy consumption for any of the nuclear option scenarios as compared to the BASE-R scenario. TABLE 4.11: NUCLEAR SCENARIOS, FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION Scenario BASE - R ANPP Life Extension till 2032 ANPP Life Extension till 2037 New nuclear - SMR 300 MW New nuclear - LWR 600 MW Final Energy Consumption % Difference -0.04% -0.05% -0.05% -0.06% PJ 2,393 2,392 2,392 2,392 2,392 Figure 4.9 presents the projected construction of new electricity generation capacity in MW by type over the period 2020 - 2036 for the BASE-R scenario and the four nuclear option scenarios, which are further summarized in terms of differences from BASE-R in Figure 4.10. After the addition of Yerevan CCGT-2 (RENCO), no gas-fired units are added. In both scenarios with new nuclear generation and in the scenario of ANPP extension to 2037, construction of the medium-sized HPPs Loriberd and Shnokh is eliminated, while in the scenario of ANPP extension to 2032 they are retained, although their entry to the system is deferred to the last two periods of the planning horizon. Compared with the BASE-R scenario, all the nuclear option scenarios delay deployment of new solar PV generation capacity, although in all cases the full amount of constrained new solar capacity (1,500 MW) is added during the planning horizon to 2036. Similarly, all the nuclear option scenarios delay deployment of new wind capacity until later in the planning horizon, and in the case of the new-nuclear LWR 600 MW capacity scenario overall new wind generation capacity grows to less than its constrained limit (500 MW) by just over 100MW.

Nuclear Scenarios, Construction of New Power Plants (by type), MW Table 4.12 summarizes the overall differences in new electricity generation capacity built over the TIMES- Armenia model planning horizon for the four nuclear option scenarios as compared to the BASE-R scenario. In the scenario with a 5-year life extension for the ANPP, the total installed capacity of new power plants is the same as in BASE-R, with differences in the timing of the implementation schedule for new hydro, solar, and wind facilities. In the scenario with ANPP life extension up to the end of the planning period, overall new generation capacity is reduced by -5.7%, as noted earlier through the exclusion of new medium-sized hydro plants. In both scenarios that introduce new nuclear capacity after the decommissioning of ANPP, the additional capacity increases of 300 and 600 MW for the new nuclear units is offset by the elimination of medium-sized hydro (141 MW), while in the LWR 600 MW scenario there is a further reduction of new wind generation capacity (by 114 MW). Table 4.13 below presents projected installed electricity generation capacities by plant or plant type for each scenario. As noted earlier, the scenarios including nuclear generation lead to somewhat later introduction of wind, with slightly reduced level compared to constraint limits in the LWR 600 MW scenario, and these scenarios eliminate the addition of medium-sized HPPs, except in the case of ANPP extension only to 2032. 62 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV Electric New Builds (by Type) - Difference from BASE-R W M 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 \u2010100 \u2010200 2020202220242027203020332036 2020202220242027203020332036 2020202220242027203020332036 2020202220242027203020332036 ANPP Life Extension to 2033 ANPP Life Extension to 2037 New nuclear \u2010 SMR 300 MW New nuclear \u2010 LWR 600 MW Wind Solar Nuclear Hydro \u201055 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 55 \u201015 0 \u201075 0 0 0 0 0 0 75 0 15 0 0 \u201055 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 55 0 0 \u201055 \u201015 \u201015 \u201015 45 0 \u201075 0 0 0 0 0 \u201066 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 55 0 0 \u201055 \u2010100 \u201044 \u201050 \u201072 56 150 \u201015 \u201015 \u201015 45 300 \u201075 0 0 0 0 0 \u201066 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u201015 \u201015 \u201015 45 600 \u201075 0 0 0 0 0 \u201066 Figure 4.10.

Nuclear Scenarios, Electricity Generation by Plant Type, TWh In all nuclear option scenarios the level of gas-fired generation is reduced compared to the BASE-R scenario: by 23% when ANPP is extended to 2032 (i.e., 958 million m3 less gas is used over the planning period); by 49% when ANPP is extended to 2037 (with 2,027 million m3 less gas used); by 35% for the new nuclear SMR 300 MW option (with 1,511 million m3 less gas used); and by 63% for the new nuclear LWR 600 MW scenario (with 2,638 million m3 less gas used). While no gas-fired capacity is added in any scenario, it is striking that in the scenario when the 600 MW LWR is added to the system the model does not elect to run existing gas plants at all after 2027.

Life extension of the ANPP to 2032 increases these investment requirements by 15%, while life extension to 2037 increases these costs by 12%, reflecting both the assumed additional $300 million and $600 million of further investment beyond the current program of safety upgrades, respectively, for these extensions and the fact that the longer life extension eliminates the investment required for both the mid-sized HPPs, Shnokh and Loriberd. The options to build a new nuclear replacement for the ANPP increase system investment costs significantly compared to the BASE-R scenario, with the SMR 300 MW requiring just over twice as much investment (an added $2.2 billion) and the LWR 600 MW scenario requiring an additional $3.1 billion.

Historically Armenia has negotiated gas prices with Russia below these European rates. In this section, the following two scenario versions are presented for trends of natural gas prices lower than European as compared to the BASE-R scenario, in all cases starting from the same initial border gas price effective from January 1, 2019, of US$ 165 per 1000 m3: \u2022 EU trend rate to 2036: Rather than imposing the higher initial growth of gas prices required to reach the European level in 2027, this scenario simply applies the EU trend growth rate over the entire period to 2036. \u2022 Growth to $180 by 2027: In this scenario, the border gas prices is assumed to grow to US$ 180 per 1000 m3 by 2027, and then to remain fixed at that level until the end of the planning period. (note: 2027 is the indicative year as this is the timing for currently- planned shutdown of the ANPP). It should be noted that in all scenarios it is assumed that the current gas transmission/distribution/supply margin does not change.

Gas Price Scenarios: Gas prices imported from Russia ($ US/1000 m3) 4.3.2 LOWER GAS PRICE TREND SCENARIO RESULTS As shown in Table 4.18, the total system cost is estimated to decrease by around 3.8% in the EU trend to 2036 scenario and by around 5.6% in scenario with gas price capped at US$ 180 per 1000 m3 after 2027 compared to the BASE-R scenario. Given the fact that gas plays such a predominant role in the Armenian energy balance, scenarios in which gas prices are significantly lower than European gas prices over the planning horizon would be expected to increase the use of gas as compared to other sources of energy, but any such increase in total system costs is clearly offset by the assumed lower prices of that gas.

In the EU trend to 2036 scenario, replacement of renewables by natural gas results in total additional use of around 32 PJ23 of primary energy supply distributed primarily between an increase of 56 PJ (roughly 1.6 billion m3) of 23 The figures in the table at the bottom of Figure 4.13 present average values for the relevant milestone period. Thus, in general the cumulative value for the entire planning horizon is calculated by summing the results of the product of these numbers by the length of the period between milestone years. Specifically, each number presented for 2020-2024 should multiplied by 2 (years) and in 2027-2036 by 3 (years) to obtain the calculated total value of the selected parameter over the planning period. It should be noted that cumulative numbers presented for the entire planning period may not exactly sum to the numbers calculated according to this approach due to 68 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV natural gas and a reduction of renewables by 22 PJ over the entire planning period. In the scenario with the gas price capped at $180, there is a 1.5 % increase of TPES, amounting to roughly 49 PJ of additional energy use, in which an additional 85 PJ (roughly 2.4 billion m3) of gas is offset by a 34 PJ reduction of renewables. Figure 4.13 below illustrates the changes in composition of TPES as compared to the BASE-R scenario for each of the lower gas price scenarios, indicating the pattern of increase in natural gas supply and reductions of renewables and of oil products, equal to 2.2 PJ for a 1.0% reduction.

Referring to the more detailed outputs of the TIMES Armenia model, the data show that FEC remains virtually unchanged by fuel and by sector, which is the result of replacing electricity generated by renewable energy sources by that produced in gas-fired power plants. Table 4.21 presents the TIMES Armenia model results for electricity generation capacity by plant and plant type over the planning horizon for each of the lower gas price scenarios, as well as for the BASE-R scenario. The key notable points in both lower gas price scenarios are that no new gas-fired power plant capacity is needed, while the mid-sized HPPS are not required and the overall level of solar and wind capacity additions remain the same, with some small variations in their timing. presentation in the tables of values only from 2020 forward to 2036, while the algorithm for model calculation also include the prior years (2018-2019) for better representation.

Since increased electricity generation based on the development of renewable energy resources is indicated as a least cost solution in the BASE-R scenario, expanding the use of these domestic energy resources could be accompanied by implementation of policies to stimulate use of electricity in the transport and in residential sectors to replace natural gas imports. To explore these opportunities, we examine the following scenarios: \u2022 \u2022 Increase in the penetration level for the use of electricity in residential heating to 25% in 2027 and to 50% by 2036; Increase in the penetration level for use of electric vehicles to 25% in 2027 and to 50% by 2036; and \u2022 Both of these scenarios combined. 4.4.2 REPLACEMENT OF GAS TO ELECTRICITY SCENARIOS RESULTS As shown in Table 4.25 the total system cost will decrease by around 1.2% in the scenario with forced penetration of electricity use for residential heating and by around 1.8% in case when 50% of the transport stock comprises electric cars by the end of planning period. In the combined scenario, the total system cost 76 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV difference from BASE-R is practically the same as the sum of the differences of individual scenarios, amounting to a 3.0% reduction in total discounted system costs.

In the residential heating scenario, replacement of natural gas consumption by electricity results in savings of around 76 PJ of natural gas (roughly 2.2 billion m3) over the entire planning period. In the electric vehicle scenario, the TPES savings amount to 79 PJ which comes from a combination of reduce use of oil products (61 PJ) and gas (31 PJ), while at the same time there is an increase of around 12 PJ of renewable energy sources to cover the increased electricity demand. Finally, in the combined scenario the total savings in TPES compared to BASE-R amounts to 153 PJ, of which 105 PJ is from reduced use of gas and a little more than 60 PJ from oil products, which again there is an additional 12 PJ of renewable energy sources to balance the total energy demand.

In all scenarios we see a slight increase in renewables, as expected. Given that oil products are not used in residential heating, all of their reduction in TPES is found in the scenario with increased use of electric vehicles. In the scenario with residential heating increased to 50% from electricity by the end of the planning period, we see reduction of total natural gas supply (import) by around 4.8%, while the share of renewables in primary energy supply has practically not changed. In the scenario with 50% electric vehicles in the transport sector by 2036 we see a significant reduction of TPES from oil products by 24.8% and of natural gas by 1.9%, as well as around 3.4% increase of renewable energy sources. The indicators for the combined scenario are close to the aggregated data from these two scenarios, amounting to a 6.5% reduction of use of natural gas for the entire planning horizon and a 25.8% reduction of oil products, with an increase of renewable sources by around 3.3%.

In the residential heating scenario, these changes primarily arise due to the more aggressive replacement of energy used by \u201cStandard\u201d demand technologies (490 PJ) by the more efficient \u201cAdvanced\u201d (35 PJ), \u201cBetter\u201d (68 PJ) and \u201cImproved\u201d (169 PJ) technologies. In the electric vehicle scenario, this reduction arises both from introducing electric transport technologies (27 PJ) and by replacing existing oil product-using technologies (58 PJ) by more advanced gas-using technologies (69 PJ). Finally, in the combined scenario there is an increase of electricity consumption by around 33 PJ in both the residential and transport sectors and a decrease of gas (152 PJ), oil products (58 PJ) and renewables (0.2 PJ).

Here we see (in the \u201cGas-fired\u201d line) that after 2027 there is increased use of the available CCGT generation as more electricity is consumed, which implies an increase in gas fuel for that which is offset by the decline in direct gas consumption for heat and transport.

This scenario examines the impact on energy system development costs of meeting Armenia\u2019s adopted NDC obligations, which were not an imposed constraint in the BASE-R scenario. In particular, this scenario forces the NDC target of 127,000 ktons of CO2-equivalent emissions over the entire planning period, which is very close to a 10% GHG reduction as compared to BASE-R by 2036, the Cumulative GHG 127 Mt Scenario. We also examine a scenario where value of the 2036 GHG emissions target is shifted forward, to be achieved by 2030, the GHG Target by 2030 Scenario. This scenario allows us to assess policy options associated with additional reduction of GHG emissions, which would provide the possibility to transfer some amount of 24 The Paris Agreement (2016) is an accord within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) dealing with GHG emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance.

Such a target could be reached by broad replacement of existing \u201cdirty\u201d technologies by non-fossil fuel ones on the demand side, and by wider implementation of renewable resources and nuclear options in electricity generation. The TIMES Armenia model results presented below summarize the possible pathways to meet Armenia\u2019s NDC obligations, while ensuring the least-cost solution on energy system development over the entire planning horizon. Given that we continue to maintain the cap on level of deployment of renewables from the BASE-R scenario, it follows that further reductions in GHG from the generation side would be driven by the next non- carbon technology, i.e., nuclear. While increased efficiency can also arise on the demand side, but it this scenario we maintain the same energy efficiency adoption assumptions as in the BASE-R scenario. As shown in Table 4.32, the total system cost will increase by around 0.9% in case of limitation of GHG emission in line with NDC requirements, and by 4.0% in the scenario where this target is reached in 2030. As will be shown later, this is primarily due to reduction of natural gas use for electricity generation in power sector through its replacement by electricity produced by a new 600 MW nuclear unit (Figure 4.23). As Shown in Figure 4.23, while the Cumulative GHG 127 Mt scenario very closely resembles the earlier New Nuclear scenario with a 600 MW NPP added, there are differences in the implementation schedule, as the earlier forced nuclear scenario brought the plant into the system from 2027, while this GHG reduction brings it on line in 2033, which results in a small difference in total system cost due to discounting. In the GHG Target by 2030 scenario there is also a different implementation schedule, with nuclear capacity added as compared to the earlier 300 MW (SMR) scenario. Figure 4.23 further shows how reaching the NDC target GHG emission limitation with nuclear and renewable replaces primarily imported natural gas. TABLE 4.32: GHG TARGET SCENARIOS, TOTAL SYSTEM COSTS Scenario BASE-R Cumulative GHG 127Mt GHG Target by 2030 System Cost 2015$M 41,029 41,392 42,676 % Difference 0.9% 4.0% The data in Table 4.33 below indicate that in both of the GHG reduction scenarios there is an overall increase in TPES. As was explained earlier in the description of the nuclear scenarios, the fact that NPP efficiency is around 33% means that the scenario-driven generation of additional nuclear electricity as compared to BASE-R is replacing the gas used in CCGTs, which have an efficiency of around 56%, contributes to this increase in TPES. Again, as the timing of implementation for new nuclear generation in these GHG reduction scenarios differs from the nuclear scenarios, there are slight differences in primary energy needs in each milestone period. A further factor influencing these results lies in the switching for demand devices to replace higher carbon emitting technologies with lower emission ones (e.g. oil products in the Transport sector being replaced by \u201ccleaner\u201d gas-using devices).

As noted above, the structure of energy carriers used on the demand side in these GHG emissions reduction scenarios differs from that in the nuclear scenarios, reflecting the requirement to reduce GHG by replacing higher-emissions devices with lower-emissions ones, while in the new nuclear scenarios the main driver of FEC is more electricity consumption from forced implementation of nuclear power.

GHG Target Scenarios, Construction of New Power Plants (by type), MW In the GHG Target by 2030 scenario the least-cost solution is achieved by construction of both Loriberd and Shnokh HPPs in 2030 to meet the requirements on additional GHG emission reduction at this milestone year, with nearly the full permissible limited amount of solar (1,448 MW) and 500 MW of wind farms, as well as two 300 MW nuclear units, the first added in 2022 and the second in 2033. While the objective of this scenario is to examine how an earlier move to the NDC GHG limitation affects system outcomes, it is important to highlight that while having a new 300 MW SMR by 2022 is not feasible, both scenarios clearly indicate that introduction of new nuclear generation together with some demand-side management activities represents the least-cost solution to reduce GHG emissions Table 4.35 summarizes the total of new electricity power generation capacity installed over the planning horizon for both GHG reduction scenarios and compares them to the BASE-R scenario. There is a significant increase in new power plant capacities compared to the BASE-R scenario, with these additions arising from GHG emission \u201cfree\u201d technologies, such as nuclear, hydro, solar and wind, which reduce the utilization of already-installed thermal power plants. Table 4.36 below presents projected installed electricity generation capacities by plant or plant type for each of the GHG reduction scenarios, as well as the BASE-R scenario. As noted earlier, these scenarios with inclusion of nuclear generation results in somewhat less solar capacity, while the more aggressive policy on emission reduction results in adding 600 MW of new nuclear, as well as both medium-sized HPPs. Figure 4.26 shows the aggregate projected generation levels by plant type over the planning horizon, which for the most part mirrors the installed capacity trends above, with the notable exception of gas-fired plants which show a marked difference by scenario.

Figure 4.26. GHG Target Scenarios, Electricity Generation by Plant Type, TWh In both of the GHG reduction scenarios the level of gas-fired generation is significantly lower compared to the BASE-R scenario: by 13% in the Cumulative GHG 127Mt scenario (i.e., 4,905 million m3 less gas is used over the planning period); and by 21.5% when the GHG reduction target is reached by 2030 (using 8,519 million m3 less gas). While no gas-fired capacity is added in any scenario, it is notable that in both of these GHG reduction scenarios the model does not elect to run existing gas plants at all after 2030. Table 4.37 summarizes the comparative fuel cost savings in each of the GHG scenarios as compared to BASE- R. While the replacement of thermal generation by nuclear and renewables does yield significant savings in imported fuel, it is useful to note how these figures compare to the increased investment costs.

In the Cumulative GHG 127 Mt scenario, power sector investment increases by more than $3.472 billion, while achieving the 2036 GHG target by 2030 requires a further investment of $1.657 billion in comparison with NDC target scenario. Comparing these levels to the New Nuclear 600 MW scenario, generation investment costs in the GHG 88 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV 127Mt scenario increase by almost $1,960 million, which is associated with construction of the Loriberd and Shnokh HPPs. In the more ambitious GHG target scenario costs are more than $2.0 billion higher compared to New Nuclear 600 MW. Finally, it is important to note that these increased levels of required investment are many times larger than the saving from reduced gas imports.

USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 89 4.6 FORCED IMPLEMENTATION OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY TARGETS 4.6.1 SCENARIO DESCRIPTION As noted earlier in Chapter 1, the Government of Armenia\u2019s policy is to promote energy efficiency in all economic sectors according to definitions formulated in the Law on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (2004; amended in 2016), and as articulated in a number of subsequent Government-approved Programs and Action Plans over the last 15 years. An approved National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (2017) is currently in place and the second stage is approved by the Government and in force. Nevertheless, as no specific long-term energy efficiency targets have been articulated we proposed to consider scenarios for forced reduction of FEC at the levels of 25% and 50% over the planning horizon to 2036. When examining these proposed scenarios within the TIMES Armenia model, it was found that implementation of a 50% energy efficiency target was not feasible. In order to find the highest possible feasible level of energy efficiency targets, further sensitivity runs for 40% and 30% reductions were performed and these cases were not also found to be feasible. Thus, in this section we examine and present the results only for a targeted 25% improvement of energy efficiency. 4.6.2 ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCENARIO RESULTS This scenario has been modeled to force a 25% reduction in total of final energy consumption (FEC) across all demand sectors by 2036. Table 4.41 shows that as a result of primary energy savings the overall system cost will decrease by around 4.3%, savings roughly equal to US $1.8 billion. As will be detailed further below this arises mostly due to fuel costs savings, for although the new higher efficiency technologies which are forced in implementation may have higher investment costs, their reduced use of fuel leads to this overall total system cost reduction.

There is also 5.2% reduction of biofuel supply, which arises after 2030 and saves around 0.12 PJ in total. Beside the reduction of all fossil fuels, use of renewable energy sources in TPES grows by 2.2%, or 0.35 PJ, reflecting the attractiveness of these carbon-free technologies to achieve the FEC reduction targets.

In the period after 2027, the growth of electricity demand is fully covered by increased generation from gas-fired plants and by the earlier implementation of the Loriberd HPP, as compared to the BASE-R Scenario. 94 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV Electric Generation (by Type) h W T 12.0 10.0 8.0 6.0 4.0 2.0 0.0 \u20102.0 2020 2022 2024 2027 2030 2033 2036 2020 2022 2024 2027 2030 2033 2036 2020 2022 2024 2027 2030 2033 2036 BASE Reference 25% reduced FEC with EE Difference from BASE\u2010R Wind Solar Nuclear Hydro 0.1 0.4 0.7 1.1 1.3 1.3 1.3 0.3 0.5 0.8 1.2 1.3 1.3 1.3 0.12 0.12 0.12 0.12 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.3 1.8 2.3 2.4 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.3 1.8 2.3 2.4 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 2.2 2.9 2.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.2 2.9 2.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 2.6 2.6 2.6 2.9 2.9 2.9 3.1 2.6 2.6 2.6 2.9 2.9 3.1 3.1 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.20 0.00 Gas\u2010fired CHPs 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Gas\u2010fired 2.9 1.7 1.3 3.4 3.1 3.2 3.5 2.6 1.5 1.2 3.4 3.4 3.3 3.8 \u20100.2 \u20100.1 \u20100.0 0.00 0.28 0.15 0.25 Figure 4.30. 25% reduced FEC Scenario: Electricity Generation by Plant Type (TWh) Table 4.45 summarizes the comparative total natural gas cost savings as a result of its reduced use in all sectors as compared to the BASE-R scenario. While the very small overall changes in power sector fuel expenditures for natural gas amounted to a $7.55 million reduction in comparison to the BASE-R scenario over the entire planning period, significant savings are recorded in total imported natural gas cost equal to $768 million as a result of more intensive implementation of energy efficiency technologies across the range of demand side uses.

SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The fact that the full amount of solar and wind capacity is selected by the model as part of the least cost solution for new generation under all scenarios underscores the importance to Armenia of ensuring a policy and institutional environment that supports full realization of new VRES generation to the maximum extent practicable, not only to ensure the lowest cost generation but also to minimize reliance on other imported energy sources and to strengthen Armenia\u2019s energy security and competitiveness. As noted earlier, the TIMES-Armenia model provides a platform for integrated energy system modelling that is designed to guide policy formulation over a wide range of energy, economic and environmental planning and policy issues, and thereby help to establish investment priorities within a comprehensive framework. Key aspects of the TIMES platform include that it: i) encompasses the entire energy system from resource extraction through to end-use demands (\u201cwell-to-wheels\u201d); ii) employs least-cost optimization to identify the most cost-effective pattern of resource use and technology deployment over time; iii) provides a framework to evaluate medium- to long-term policies and programs that can impact the evolution of the energy system; and iv) quantifies the costs and technology choices that result from imposing those policies and program. Besides the strengths of the core modelling features of TIMES, the framework includes powerful model management tools to facilitate the effective use to inform decisionmakers. Thus, the TIMES platform is specifically a tool to develop and compare scenarios for future energy development and as such can be a productive tool to foster stakeholder buy-in and build consensus. The following sections highlight some of the key insights for energy sector policy development in Armenia over the period to 2036 that can be gleaned from the detailed scenario analyses presented above. To facilitate this discussion, we have gathered selected key modelling metrics and ratios in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Detailed model results for each of the core scenarios can be found in Appendix 4. 5.1 THE BASELINE REFERENCE (BASE-R) SCENARIO The TIMES-Armenia modelling exercise started by imposing no constraints on the technology choice for future energy sector development. A key result of this exercise was to identify expansion of variable renewable energy sources (VRES), in particular solar and wind energy, as the clear least-cost sources for new generation capacity, given the combination of Armenia\u2019s rich solar resource and trends in declining cost of solar power over the planning period. As a result, the level of projected VRES capacity in the initially unconstrained variant of the baseline scenario was so high, adding nearly 3,000 MW of grid-connected solar and over 1,000 MW of wind power by 2036, it was clear that some more reasonable levels of constrained expansion of VRES generation would be needed, both to reflect potential limitations in institutional capacity to build so much new solar and wind in the coming decades and to ensure the planning and investment for any needed system strengthening that might be required to accommodate the higher shares of VRES in the total generation mix. Thus, through expert consultation with stakeholders it was agreed that a reasonable level of constrained maximum VRES capacity to be modelled would be set at 1,500 MW of solar and 500 MW of wind until the end of the planning horizon, along with limits on the annual build rates. This set of added assumptions was then applied to the baseline model and the results, described earlier and summarized in Tables 5.1 and 5.2 establish the Baseline Reference (BASE-R) Scenario.

While some additional hydropower capacity is added in the BASE-R scenario to account for licenses already provided by PSRC, no other types of new generation are selected by the model (taking into account that the gas-fired Yerevan CCGT-2 TPP is already included from 2022) and recognizing that this scenario foresees closure of the ANPP from 2027 according to current planning. The total funding required for new power plant construction in this scenario is just under $1.9 billion, while projected imported natural gas fuel expenditures for electricity generation are $4.25 billion. Finally, in the BASE-R scenario total energy system costs27 account for roughly 11% of GDP over the planning period, while the energy intensity of GDP as measured by TPES is around 8.37 MJ/$. Taking into consideration that GDP growth is the main driver of energy demand growth, two sensitivity analyses were modelled to explore the influence of higher and lower GDP growth rates on the Armenian 27 As noted earlier, these are the net present value of the sum of costs projected by the model associated with ensuring development and operation of Armenia\u2019s energy system to meet the projected energy consumption over the period to 2036, comprising all costs associated with both the supply of energy and with end-use demands for energy across all five sectors of the model, i.e., agriculture, commercial, industry, residential, and transport. Investment costs in the model methodology include not only the spending required to build new power plants or new industrial facilities, but also the costs associated with replacing existing facilities and further include all spending on such end-use energy items as new or replacement electrical appliances, heating/cooling devices, cars and trucks and industrial and agricultural equipment. Similarly, for each final energy consumption sector, the variable and fixed operation and maintenance costs include all costs, required to ensure safe and uninterrupted operation of all the technologies and installations not only in the supply, transmission and distribution systems, but also for all consumer (demand) needs, while fuel costs include fuels for transport and residential heating, as well as for electricity generation and industrial processes. USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 99 energy system\u2019s least cost development pathway. In particular, the cases analysed were for a 50% higher growth rate (6.75% per year from 2022) and a 50% lower rate (2.25% per year from 2022, as compared to the 4.5% per annum GDP growth rate in the BASE-R scenario. A surprising but crucial result of these sensitivity analyses is that the model projects no differences in total new power plant capacities in level or by type required to cover electricity demand over the full range of GDP growth variation, with only slight variations in the implementation schedule for new solar, wind and hydro power depending on the required consumption level in each time period. Thus, there is virtually no impact as well on the investment requirement for new electricity generation capacity as compared to the BASE- R scenario. The only effect of higher (lower) income growth lies in the increased (decreased) utilization of existing installed capacity of both VRES and gas-fired thermal power plants, with a concomitant increase (decrease) in expenditures on natural gas fuel. Given this key result, no further detailed sensitivity analyses of the impacts of higher and lower growth rates was reported for any of the other scenarios. While these higher (lower) growth rates have expected impacts in regard to increasing (decreasing) total system costs, TPES, FEC and electricity generation, it is especially interesting to note that the higher GDP growth rate also reduces the share of total system cost in GDP, owing to the fact that it is accompanied by significant lowering of the energy intensity of a unit of GDP, e.g., by 16% as measured by TPES. In fact, the high-growth case of BASE-R projects an even lower level of TPES per unit of GDP than the scenario which explicitly pursues reduced FEC through expanded energy efficiency (7.0 MJ/$ as compared to 7.5 MJ/$). This enhanced efficiency is clearly seen in the fact that while overall GDP increases in total by 27% compared to the BASE-R scenario, total system costs increase only by 12% and TPES by 6.3%. This is also reflected in the fact that aggregate purchases of demand devices increase by almost 19%, which presumably embeds higher levels of efficiency over time as incomes rise. Conversely, the lower growth has mirroring adverse impacts on increasing total system costs as a share of GDP and increasing the energy intensity per unit of GDP. 5.2 NUCLEAR SCENARIOS Activities to extend the operational lifetime of the ANPP up to 2027 are already in place and the plant was included in the BASE-R Scenario to be decommissioned from that time. Although the available nuclear technologies included in the TIMES-Armenia model were not selected on the basis of least cost in the BASE-R Scenario, the GOAM remains committed to a policy to maintain some nuclear power in the country\u2019s energy mix. To analyze the cost and other implications of these choices, four alternative scenarios for continued inclusion of nuclear generation in the Armenian power system were examined as: \uf0b7 Operating life extension of the ANPP for an additional 5 years after 2027 - up to 2032, with an additional $300 million of to ensure safety and reliability; \uf0b7 Operating life extension of the ANPP for an additional 10 years after 2027 - up to 2037, with an additional $600 million of investment to ensure safety and reliability; \uf0b7 Forced implementation of a new nuclear unit with installed capacity 300 MW (Small Modular Reactor - SMR), and \uf0b7 Forced implementation of a new nuclear unit with installed capacity 600 MW (Light Water Reactor - LWR). 100 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV As shown in Table 5.1, the scenarios for life extension of the ANPP by 5 and 10 years, which were not included in BASE-R, decrease total system cost by around 1%, increase TPES by 3.7% and 7.3%, reduce GHG emissions significantly by 4.5% and 9.3% and decrease imports of natural gas for electricity generation by 11.8% and 20.4%, respectively. A key feature of these scenarios is that they increase total investment costs for new power generation capacity 15.1% and 12.5%, compared the BASE-R scenario, with the higher investment costs for the longer extension being offset in its impact on total investment by the fact that in this scenario neither of the mid-sized HPPs (Shnokh and Loriberd) is built. The scenarios which propose new nuclear units to replace the ANPP from 2027 with either a 300 MW SMR or a 600 MW LWR increase total system cost by around 2%, increase TPES by 3.3% and 7.8%, reduce GHG emissions significantly by 7.1% and 12.2%, and decrease imports of natural gas for electricity generation by 7.2% and 15.5%, respectively. A key impact in these scenarios is that they significantly increase total investment costs for new power generation capacity compared the BASE-R scenario, more than doubling it to $4.1 billion (a 116% increase) for the 300 MW SMR unit and increasing it to over $5 billion (a 164% increase) for the 600 MW LWR unit. Whether considering total system cost or investment costs required for new generation, the scenarios for life extension of the ANPP represent a least-cost policy choice for continuing to maintain nuclear capacity in Armenia\u2019 energy mix. It should be emphasized that such life extensions must always first and foremost ensure all measures required for continued safe and reliable operation of these older plants. As a final point, it is useful to note that the scenarios which imposed GHG emissions reduction targets to meet the level defined in Armenia\u2019s NDC, either by 2036 or earlier, largely mirror the \u201cnew nuclear\u201d scenarios in terms of increases in total system cost and TPES, reductions in GHG emissions and decreases in imports of natural gas for electricity generation. This is not surprising, given that in these scenarios, with the constrained amounts of solar and wind VRES fully utilized, the next choice for lower GHG-emissions generation leads to selection of the new nuclear technologies, in this case introduction of 600 MW of nuclear power. Given the slightly different implementation patterns for the introduction of nuclear units in these scenarios as compared to the forced implementation in 2027 examined earlier, the impact on total investment costs for new power generation capacity is even larger compared to the BASE-R scenario, ranging from $5.4 - $7.0 billion. 5.3 DIFFERENT TRENDS IN IMPORTED GAS PRICES The BASE-R scenario assumed that the natural gas price will increase up to projected European levels by 2027 (the year of ANPP decommissioning) and after that continue to match European levels. Historically Armenia has negotiated gas prices with Russia below these rates, so two scenarios were analyzed with lower gas prices as28: \u2022 EU trend rate to 2036: Applies the EU trend growth rate over the entire period to 2036, and \u2022 Growth to $180 by 2027: Assumes the border gas prices grows to US$ 180/1000 m3 by 2027 and remains fixed at that level until the end of the planning period. 28 All cases start from the same initial border gas price effective from January 1, 2019, of US$ 165 per 1000 m3 and all scenarios assume that the current gas transmission/distribution/supply margin does not change. USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 101 As expected, analysis of these scenarios shows that if Russia continues to provide relatively low-cost natural gas to Armenia there will be a significant increase of natural gas consumption across all sectors, but mainly in electricity generation, transportation and residential heating. In both scenarios, the expanded use of existing gas-fired TPP capacity means that the mid-sized HPPs (Shnokh and Loriberd) are not built, while no additional thermal power capacity is required after the inclusion of Yerevan CCGT-2 (RENCO) and the closure of Hrazdan TPP. This results in a roughly 20% reduction in the lumpsum investment required for new generation in these scenarios, the lowest in any scenarios - although still with the constrained levels of solar and wind generation fully built - which generates an investment cost saving as compared to BASE-R of $377 million in the case with the EU trend to 2036 and of $391 million when the gas price is capped at $180. While total energy system cost is reduced when gas prices are lower, it is important to note that the increased utilization of cheaper gas maintains and deepens Armenia\u2019s dependence on imported energy. In both scenarios there is an overall increase in TPES, by 1 - 1.5%, because of increased use of the cheaper imported natural gas, which is accompanied by a reduction in use of VRES. In the case when gas prices follow the EU trend, replacement of renewables by natural gas results in total additional TPES of around 32 PJ, which is distributed between an increase of 56 PJ (roughly 1.6 billion m3) of natural gas and a reduction of renewables use by 22 PJ over the planning period. When the gas price is capped at $180 from 2027, the increase of TPES is roughly 49 PJ, comprising an increase of 85 PJ of gas (roughly 2.4 billion m3), which is offset by a 34 PJ reduction of use of renewables. 5.4 PROMOTING FUEL SWITCHING TO ELECTRICITY IN TRANSPORT AND RESIDENTIAL HEATING Analysis of FEC by energy carrier and sector showed that the most consumed fuel source in Armenia is and will continue to be imported natural gas, most of which is used for residential heating and transport. Since increased electricity generation based on development of Armenia\u2019s VRES is indicated as a least cost solution in the BASE-R scenario, and confirmed in all other scenarios, expanding use of these domestic energy resources could be accompanied by implementation of policies to stimulate use of electricity in the transport and residential sectors to replace natural gas imports. To explore these opportunities, we examined the following scenarios: \u2022 Increase in the penetration level for the use of electricity in residential heating to 25% in 2027 and to 50% by 2036, and Increase in the penetration level for use of electric vehicles to 25% in 2027 and to 50% by 2036. \u2022 \u2022 Both of these scenarios together. As shown in Table 5.1, each of these scenarios proposing increased sectoral electricity penetration separately reduces total system cost (in combination by 3%), reduces TPES (again, in combination by 5%), lowers GHG emissions (by nearly 8%, in combination) and decreases imports of natural gas for electricity generation (in combination by 7.6%). The reduction in natural gas used for electricity generation shows clearly that a policy to promote increased deployment of electric heating and vehicles will expand utilization of domestic VRES, reduce reliance on imported energy sources and strengthen Armenia\u2019s energy security. Most importantly, no change in the overall level and type of new generation is required by the model as compared to the BASE-R scenario to achieve these results, with only a negligible increase in the lumpsum investment costs for new generation capacity associated with slight variations in the implementation schedule for the projected additions of solar and wind power. 102 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV REFERENCES .

THE COMPOSITION OF FEC IN THE BASE YEAR In the base year, the total final energy consumption (FEC) amounted to 2,094.6 kilotons of oil equivalent (ktoe), out of which the households and Transport accounted for just over 1,400 ktoe. The base year data indicates the leading position of households, which accounted for 37% of total FEC, with Transport second at almost 30%. In the base year, Services and Industry accounted for 15.6% and 15.3% of FEC, respectively, while Agriculture had the smallest share in the total Armenian FEC at 2%. In 2016, natural gas was the dominant type of fuel, amounting to 1,209.6 ktoe or 57.7% of total FEC. Figure A.1.1 shows FEC by sector and types of fuel in 2016. e o t k 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 Electricity Heat Renewables Natural Gas Oil Coal Industry 140.2 0.8 158.2 20.9 0 Transport Households Agriculture 8.6 386.6 224.9 159.5 0.3 143.3 480.6 0.8 0.3 9.9 32.8 Services 140 1.1 184.2 0.6 1 Figure A.1.1. Final energy consumption by sectors and fuel types, 2016 (ktoe) The Residential sector consumed 784.7 ktoe in 2016, making up to 37% of Armenian total FEC. Natural gas was the biggest form of energy consumed, representing 480.6 ktoe or 61.2% of total household energy consumption. In the base year coal and heat were the least used fuel types, each just 0.03%. The amount of different fuel types consumed in Residential sector are reflected in Figure A.1.2. Because natural gas and electricity were the main energy carriers used by households, their monthly consumption has been analyzed further in order to allocate the total amount of natural gas demand between heat, hot water, and cooking and for electricity demand between heat, hot water, cooking, air conditioning, and appliances. It was assumed that gas demand for hot water preparation and cooking remain unchanged throughout the year, while differences between winter and summer consumption patterns are reflected heating demands. The same analysis was done for electricity, where variations in monthly (and time of day) consumption patterns clearly showed for air conditioning and heating demand. The remaining demands - for hot water, cooking and appliances - are also kept constant throughout the year. This reconstruction was USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 105 required by TIMES in order to identify the shares of each demand for the Armenian model. Based on review of the Economic Development and Research Center \u201cAnalytic Report on Residential Energy Consumption Survey: 2015 (EDRC, 2016), electricity consumption was redistributed among the different types of appliances defined in the TIMES-Armenia model, in particular: lighting, refrigerators and freezers, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, fans, mills, mixers, radio electronic equipment, and others. 600 500 400 e o 300 t k 200 100 0 480.6 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.6 1.1 BROWN COAl Gas/Diesel Oil excl. bio Fire wood Heat Anthracite Natural Gas Solid biomass Electricity 159.5 83.7 52.4 6 0.3 Liquefied Petroleum Gases Solar Thermal Other biomass Figure A.1.2.

In 2016, electricity accounted for 140 ktoe of Service sector energy consumption, representing 42.8% of sector total and 6.7% of the total FEC of Armenia.

Fuel Types Used in the Service (Commercial) sector, 2016 (ktoe) For the Service sector, the same approach was used as described above for the Household sector in regard to allocation of the total demand between cooling, cooking, heating, lighting, miscellaneous, public lighting, refrigeration, and water heating. The TIMES-Armenia model splits the Industrial sector into the sub-sectors listed in the table below. Food beverages and tobacco Iron and steel Chemical and petrochemical Paper, pulp and printing Non-ferrous metals Non-metallic minerals Transport equipment Machinery Mining and quarrying Wood and wood products Textiles and leather Construction Non-specified (Other Industry) In 2016, Industrial sector FEC was 320.1 ktoe, a 15.3% share of Armenian FEC. Figure A.1.4 shows the base year consumption by fuel types and by each sub-sector of industry. The chart illustrates the leading positions of mining and quarrying, also food, beverages and tobacco sub-sectors in industry consumption, representing 27% and 26.9% respectively, whereas wood and wood products, also textiles and leather were recorded as smallest industrial consumption types of fuel, representing 0.3% and 0.4% respectively. As shown in the chart, natural gas and electricity hold the dominance in industry consumption, representing correspondingly 49.4% and 43.8% of the total consumption of the sector and 7.5% and 6.7% of Armenian total final energy consumption, whereas white spirit & SBP and liquefied petroleum gases came out to be the least consumed type of energy, representing 0.3% and 0.4% respectively.

Final Energy Consumption by Industry Sub-sectors and Fuel Types, 2016 (ktoe) The structure of fuel and electricity consumption in the Transport sector of Armenia differs radically from that of similar the countries in the region and those of Commonwealth of Independent States as a whole. These specific characteristics are largely based on the following factors: \uf0b7 Long-term transportation blockade of the country by Turkey and Azerbaijan limiting trading opportunities (export/import); \uf0b7 High prices for imported oil products; and \uf0b7 Existing transport infrastructure (fully electrified railway transport, ground and underground urban electric transport, developed road network, etc.). Thus, the availability and relative low cost of natural gas compared to liquid motor fuels led to a massive shift of the road transport to the use of natural gas. By the early 2000\u2019s, up to 90% of the light vehicles and most of urban public transport are equipped with dual fuel systems using natural gas with gasoline as a backup fuel. As a result, an extensive network of gas charging stations has been established, covering almost the entire country and a drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions was recorded in the transport sector between 1998 and 2018. The structure of fuel and electricity consumption in the Transport sector is based on the statistical data and expert estimates. During the base year, total energy consumption of this sector was 620.2 ktoe, representing 108 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV 29.6% of the total FEC of Armenia, divided between: rail, metro, other electric transport; road transport; aviation; non-specified (other transport). Figure A.1.5 shows the base year consumption of transportation sub- sectors by fuel types. The road sub-sector had by far the biggest share in this sector, representing 611.5 ktoe or 98.6% of total transport FEC and 29.2% of total Armenian FEC. Natural gas and oil were the main types of fuel consumed in transport and particularly in road sub-sector, representing 62.3% and 36.3% respectively. e o t k 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 Electricity Natural gas Gas/Diesel Oil excl. bio Motor Gasoline excl bio Liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) Rail, metro, other electric transport 6.2 Road 386.6 74.8 146.7 3.4 Aviation 1.7 Non\u2010specified (transport) 0.7 Figure A.1.5. Final energy consumption by transport and fuel types, 2016 (ktoe) The Agriculture sector has a small share in total FEC, with the use of energy in 2016 of 42.7 ktoe, representing 2% of Armenian total FEC. This includes electricity, diesel and kerosene. Oil products composed the largest share in agriculture energy consumption, at 32.8 ktoe or 76.8%, consisting of gas/diesel oil, excluding bio (25.2 ktoe) and other kerosene (7.6 ktoe). Figure A.1.6 describes the sectoral consumption by fuel types. Further analysis of sectoral energy consumption shows that: \uf0fc The entire share of electricity was consumed for irrigation purposes; \uf0fc Diesel fuel was only used by the agricultural machinery for crops sowing and harvesting; and \uf0fc The amount of kerosene was insignificant and is assumed to have been used for other purposes.

ELECTRICITY GENERATION OPTIONS FOR TIMES- ARMENIA29 1. INTRODUCTION This Appendix describes the power plant options available in the TIMES-Armenia model. If not otherwise noted, the main source for data is Projected Costs of Generating Electricity 2015 Edition, prepared by the Nuclear Energy Agency and International Energy Agency and published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (NEA/IEA/OECD, 2015)30. It complies power plant data across a selection of countries, but where the only non-OECD country included in this list is China. 2. GAS-FIRED GENERATING TECHNOLOGIES The Projected Costs of Generating Electricity 2015 report identifies two gas-fired generation options: combined- cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) and open-cycle gas turbines (OCGTs). It includes data for 17 natural gas-fired generators (13 CCGTs and 4 OCGTs). For TIMES-Armenia four CCGTs and 4 OCGTS were chosen from same countries (Belgium, Germany, UK, New Zealand) and their characteristics were averaged. For fossil fuel plants, the residual value of equipment and materials shall normally be assumed to be equal to the cost of dismantling and site restoration, resulting in a zero net cost of decommissioning. The Projected Costs of Generating Electricity 2015 doesn\u2019t identify any emerging technology for gas-fired generating technologies, this is why no additional options are considered.

NUCLEAR GENERATING TECHNOLOGIES There are many different designs of nuclear plants available around the world and a dedicated feasibility study would be required to analyze the application of different options for Armenia. The comparison of different nuclear plant designs is outside of the scope and capacities of TIMES-Armenia project, however to analyze the competitiveness of nuclear options against other power plant options in meeting Armenia\u2019s future electricity demands it is important to establish consistent characteristics for the different plant options. Given the 29 Sections 1-6 of this Appendix were prepared by support partner DecisionWare Group in November 2018 for use in defining generation technologies suitable for inclusion in the TIMES model, as it is adapted to Armenia. Section 7 was prepared by the SRIE. 30 NEA/IEA/OECD (2015), Projected Costs of Generating Electricity 2015, OECD Publishing, Paris,  USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 111 relatively near-term need of Armenia, focus is made on most advanced and mature technology currently available, which is advanced light water reactor (ALWR). ALWRs can either be pressurized water (PWR) or boiling water (BWR). Russian VVER, considered as an option for Armenia, is also ALWR type. For Armenia, the size of nuclear plant is important. Because of this, the economy of scale of nuclear plants was applied to calculate the costs of smaller versions of ALWR, establishing consistent data for competitive analysis of nuclear plants of different size, as discussion below. The Projected Costs of Generating Electricity 2015 provides detailed information for 11 nuclear power plants, of which 9 are in OECD member countries and the remaining two are in China. This includes a generic light water reactor (LWR), ten advanced light water reactors and generic generation III reactors. For new designs, net plant capacities range from around 1,000 to 3,300 MW (for a multiple-unit plant in the United Kingdom). All the reactors in this report are based on light water technologies, indicating that the industry trend towards this technology continues. TABLE lists the nuclear plants in Projected Costs of Generating Electricity 2015. TABLE A.2.2: LIST OF NUCLEAR GENERATING TECHNOLOGIES As seen from TABLE there is there is a large difference in nuclear costs between Europe, US and Asia. Because of this fact, it is important to consider the origin of the possible power plants for Armenia. The Russian VVER version, for example, is the one deployed in Hungary, with a cost of 6,215 USD2013/kW. Another study for South Africa31 shows an estimated overnight capital cost of $50-billion (including owners development costs but excluding interest during construction) for a 9.6 GW nuclear fleet with a net output of 6 x 1,082 MW using 31  112 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV Rosatom VVER 1200 reactors, an overnight cost of USD5,776 per kW net output is calculated. However cost for a single unit will be higher by 10 to 20%, which will result in the number around 6,600 USD/kW. As seen from TABLE the Chinese, Korean and US versions are considerably cheaper. Based on this we suggest two versions of ALWR, one based on average characteristics of ALWR globally and the second based solely on Hungary data. It should be mentioned that TABLE also includes the nuclear power plant in Mohovce, Slovak Republic, which consists of 2 blocks with 513MW each. However, this is for a project originally initiated in 1986, the design of which has evolved substantially from the original water-cooled and water-moderated reactor (VVER) V-213 specifications, because of this it is not considered. Emerging nuclear technologies in the 2015-2030 timeframe include small modular reactors (SMRs), essentially based on the same technology as today\u2019s generation III reactors (namely light water reactors). There are wide- ranging projections for installed SMR capacity by 2030. Because of their size the specific per-MW costs of SMRs are likely to be higher (typically 50% to 100% higher per kWh for a single SMR plant) than those of large generation III reactors. Variable costs (O&M and fuel costs) for SMRs most likely will remain higher than for large nuclear plants as well. Based on Current Status, Technical Feasibility and Economics of Small Nuclear Reactors (NEA 2011)32, because of economies of scale, SMRs will suffer a significant economic disadvantage compared to large reactors in terms of their overnight costs per unit of installed capacity. Specific capital costs (i.e. capital costs per unit of installed capacity) are expected to decrease with size because of fixed set-up costs (e.g. siting activities or earth works for connecting to the transmission grid), more efficient utilization of primary inputs (e.g. raw materials), and the higher performance of larger components (e.g. pumps, heat exchangers, steam generators, etc.). Several studies have employed the following scaling function to illustrate the effect of changing from a plant unit size P0 to a plant of similar design with capacity P1: Cost(P1) = Cost(P0)x(P1/P0)n (1) where Cost(P1) and Cost(P0) are the costs of power plants of size P1 and P0 respectively, and n is the scaling factor for the entire plant (this is an overall scaling law for the entire plant\u2014different components of the plant may have substantially different scaling exponentsCurrent Status, Technical Feasibility and Economics of Small Nuclear Reactors gives some examples of n. For Korea n=0.45, for France n=0.6 for direct costs and 0.3 for indirect costs. For this study we have assumed the scaling factor of 0.6 for overnight and O&M costs. Because we consider the SMRs of same LWR type, the application of Formula (1) is valid. TABLE and TABLE A.2.4 show alternative suggestions for nuclear plants. The most feasible one should be chosen for the main analysis, whereas the second one can be used for sensitivity analysis. 32 NEA (Nuclear Energy Agency).

Lower overall investment costs and shorter construction times for SMRs could also facilitate the financing of such reactors compared to large nuclear plants at lower costs of capital). Furthermore, they can be more discretely sized accorded to the capacity needed owing to the modular nature of the design. So, other sensitivity scenarios can be performed for higher n in formula (1) which will analyze the sensitivity of results compared to the future costs of SMRs. In all cases Decommissioning costs for nuclear plants are higher than those for other generation types, in part because of the additional cost of removing all remaining radioactive materials. Plant-specific decommissioning costs were used when provided, and a default assumption of 15% of the overnight cost was used for all other plants. Prototypes of generation IV reactors, that could include very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR) for electricity and process heat applications, and liquid metal-cooled reactors such as sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFR) and lead-cooled fast reactors (LFR), were not considered. In terms of generation costs, generation IV technologies aim to be at least as competitive as generation III technologies (and will build on the enhanced safety levels of those technologies), though the additional complexity of these designs, the need to develop a specific supply chain for these reactors and the development of the associated fuel cycles will make this a challenging task. However, generation IV also provide additional benefits in terms of fuel utilization and waste management (especially for fast neutron reactors) or in terms of high thermal efficiency (>40%), and potential for high temperature process heat application for HTRs and this could represent an economic advantage over alternative technologies. 114 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV 4. SOLAR POWER PLANTS Solar PV plants are divided into three categories: Residential rooftop (less than 20 kWe), Commercial rooftop (from 20 kWe to 1 MWe), and large (greater than 1 MW) ground-mounted central plants. In addition we consider solar thermal technologies, which are able to produce significant amounts of power (installation sizes tend to range from the tens to hundreds of megawatts) and can be used with thermal storage solutions such as molten salts to extend their electric power production into peak evening hours. Conversely, solar thermal power plants use more materials, in particular steel, than other types of solar power, and so are relatively more capital-intensive and will often also have higher operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. For Armenia, we have selected two options from the US, one with 6-hour storage, which reaches annual Capacity Factor (CF) =34% and another with 12 hour storage reaching CF=50, as opposed to PVs whose CF range between 15%-20% in US). However, for Armenia country-specific CFs are used for all Solar plants. TABLE A.2.5: SOLAR PLANT OPTIONS Process type Lifetime (years) Construction period (years) Overnight cost (USD2013/kW) O&M Costs 33 (USD2013/MWh) PV - Residential PV - Commercial PV - Large Thermal (6h storage) Thermal (12h storage) 25 25 25 25 25 1 1 1 1 1 2377 1583 1562 3571 4901 28.92 23.48 28.99 17.38 13.88 5. OTHER POWER PLANTS Other power plants include hydro, geothermal and onshore wind plants. Country specific CFs should be used in all cases. Hydroelectric and geothermal plants are very site-specific, so it is advisable to use country-specific costs and CFs. Decommissioning costs are assumed to be 5% of overnight costs. See Section 7 below for additional details.

USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 115 irrigation and flood control) is not included. If dams are to be considered for Armenia, the local country specific costs should be used. 6. ELECTRICITY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES Energy storage technologies absorb energy and store it for a period of time before releasing it to supply energy or power services. Through this process, storage technologies can bridge temporal and geographical gaps between energy supply and demand. Some technologies such as pumped storage hydropower are mature; however, improvements can be made with respect to the ratio of electric capacity to storage volume; flexibility in pumping mode with variable-speed pumps, and sea water pumped storage hydropower, to better help integrate variable renewables. Most other technologies are still at early stages of development and will require further RD&D before their potential can be fully realized. Emerging electricity storage technologies include compressed air energy storage (CAES), adiabatic CAES, a range of batteries, flywheels and hydrogen storage. Investment in energy storage RD&D has led to significant cost reductions. In addition, costs for large-scale batteries have shown impressive reductions, thanks in part to ambitious electric vehicle deployment programs and greater demand for frequency regulation. The cost of a lithium-ion battery for grid-scale storage has shown the largest decline, falling by more than three-quarters between 2008 and 2013. However, additional efforts, including targeted R&D investments and demonstration projects, are needed to further decrease energy storage costs and accelerate development. The setup for TIMES-Armenia is based on lithium-ion battery from report from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)34.

DESCRIPTION OF ARMENIA-SPECIFIC OPTIONS 7.1.1 RENEWABLES DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS 7.1.1.1 SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE HPPS Lack of fossil fuel in Armenia dictates the necessity to utilize domestic energy sources (hydro, wind, solar, etc.) as much as ecologically and economically feasible. With respect to small hydro resources, according to PSRC data, in addition to existing 186 small hydro power plants (SHPPs) with total installed capacity 336.4 MW, 31 companies have licenses for construction of 56.88 MW SHPPs. At this stage, no additional SHPPs are foreseen for construction due to new more stringent ecological and technical requirements, changes in water resources patterns, in part due to global warming, and the absence of economically feasible locations. 34  116 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV As stated by Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources, there is still potential for development of medium-size HPPs , in particular Lori-Berd, Shnokh and Meghri35. Below are some main indicators for these projects. Lori-Berd HPP Construction of the Lori-Berd HPP (with around 60MW of installed capacity and 200 million kWh of annual energy production) on the Dzoraget river plays important role for the Armenian hydro energy sector development. In the years 2003-2004 Fichtner prepared a feasibility study for the above-mentioned station. In February 2007, Fichtner updated the price calculations for the project. Price increases were mostly attributed to higher equipment cost. Lori-Berd HPP Is planned to be constructed in the northern part of Armenia, where there are not large production entities, and would strengthen the energy supply to the northern parts of the country, as well as provide the energy system with opportunities for parallel operation between Armenia and Georgia. It is foreseen to implement the Lori-Berd HPP construction by attracting private financial investment. Lori-Berd HPP characteristics are as follows: \uf0fc Design head \u2013 343 m (with daily regulated pond) \u2013 311.75 m (without daily regulated pond); \uf0fc Design discharge - 25 m3/s (with daily regulated pond) - 20 m3/s (without daily regulated pond); \uf0fc Design Power Capacity - 65.3 MW (with daily regulated pond) - 54.3 MW (without daily regulated pond), and \uf0fc Annual average Energy Production - 202.9 million kWh (with daily regulated pond) - 208.3 million kWh (without daily regulated pond). Shnokh HPP The original design of Shnokh HPP was prepared by Armhydroenergy Project in 1966 and was updated in 1993. Construction of the Armanis reservoir with 130 million m3 capacity would allow to construct a power station with 120 MW of the installed capacity and 460 million kWh annual energy production. The head pond of Shnokh HPP would be constructed at the top of the Debet River, after the unification of Dzoraget and Pambak rivers. It is foreseen to correct the flow of Marts and Kistum steams on the derivation of Shnokh HPP. The characteristics of the Shnokh HPP, without construction of Armanis reservoir, are as follows: \uf0fc Design head - 247.3 m; \uf0fc Design discharge - 37 m3/s; \uf0fc Design Power Capacity - 76 MW; \uf0fc Annual Energy Production - 291.4 million kWh; \uf0fc Derivation Length-22 km, and \uf0fc Daily regulated pond - 450 thous.m3. On August 10, 2017, the GoA adopted Protocol Decision N 973-A \u201cOn approval of Framework Agreement signed between the Government of Armenia, Debed Hydro LLC and Investors Club of Armenia Closed-end 35 According to the high-level agreement between Armenia and Iran, Meghri HPP would be transferred to Armenia after 15 years of operation. Taking into consideration both delay of initial operation year (2017) and construction period (5 years) this project will be excluded from TIMES modelling due to the fact that earliest operation year (2039) will be out of the planning period. USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 117 Contractual Nonpublic Investment Fund for the Design, Construction, Funding, Ownership, Possession and Exploitation of Shnokh Hydropower Plant with 76 MW Installed Capacity in Lori Region of RA\u201d. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between Debed Hydro LLC, subsidiary of Energy Invest Holding CJSC and the U.S. Robbins Company, that has substantial international experience in boring large tunnels. According to the MOU, Robbins would invest charter capital for Debed Hydro LLC by providing a Tunnel Boring Machine for boring the water pipe with 22 km length foreseen by Shnokh HPP construction program, training local Armenian specialists in use of the boring machine, and provide technical support during duration of the boring works. The estimated cost of the implementation of Shnokh HPP construction program is about 150-190 million USD. Meghri HPP The feasibility study of Meghri HPP was prepared by the Iranian Mahab Ghods consulting company at the bequest of the Iranian Water and Energy Development Company. The feasibility study for development of Meghri HPP was coordinated and controlled by Armenian-Iranian Joint Technical Committee. In accordance with the feasibility study completed in 2008 the possibility to construct 2 HPPs on the river Araks: Meghri HPP in Armenian side and Gharachilar HPP on Iranian side is foreseen. Megri HPP's main technical characteristics are as follows: \uf0fc Design discharge \uf0fc Design Power Capacity \uf0fc Energy Production \uf0fc Derivation length (tunnel) \uf0fc Tunnel Inner diameter \uf0fc Design head 160 m3/s; 100 (2\u044550) MW; 793 million kWh; 18200 m; 8.5 m, and 90 m . In the framework of Armenia\u2019s inter-governmental commission with Iran, it was decided to construct Meghri HPP and Gharachilar HPP with 100 MW installed capacity each, taking into the considerations the water resources new survey results. Small HPPs As of the 1st of January, 2018 and according to the provided licenses, 36 additional SHPPs are under construction, amounting to about 69 MW capacity and 250 million kWh electricity annual supply. 7.1.1.2 SOLAR Armenia has a significant solar energy potential. The average annual amount of solar energy flow per square meter of horizontal surface is about 1,720 kWh, compared with the average European figure of 1,000 kWh. One fourth of the country\u2019s territory is endowed with solar energy resources of 1,850 kWh/m2/year. A Renewable Energy Investment Plan for Armenia was approved in the framework of the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy Program (SREP) of the Climate Investment Funds, with SREP resources are being allocated to develop up to 110 MW of utility-scale solar PV. According to the first stage of the \u201cSolar PV Plant Construction Investment Project\u201d approved by GoA Protocol Decision 53-37 dated December 29, 2016, it is foreseen to construct the utility-scale Masrik-1 solar 118 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV PV power plant with 50-55 MW capacity in Gegharkunik Marz of Armenia. Construction of another 5 PV plants with about 60 MW total capacity are being planned. On July 18, 2018 the Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources signed a Government Assistance Agreement \u201cOn Design, Funding, Construction, Ownership, Possession and Exploitation of Masrik-1 PV power plant in Mets Masrik community of Gegharkunik Region of Armenia\u201d. The parties of the Agreement are FRV Masrik CJSC (as a Constructor), Fotowatio Renewable Ventures B.V and FSL companies (as a Sponsor) and the Government of RA. The limit for the construction of utility-scale Solar PV Plant of up to 1 MW installed capacity is set at 10 MW total installed capacity, and 12 companies have received Licenses. Currently 4 solar PV plants (total installed capacity about 2.6 MW) are commissioned. 7.1.1.3 WIND According to Wind Energy Resource Atlas of Armenia, prepared by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory in 2003, the economically justified potential of wind energy is about 450 MW of total installed capacity with about 1.26 billion kWh of electrical energy production per year. The main perspective sites are located in Zod pass, in Bazum Mountain (Qaraqhach and Pushkin passes), in Jajur pass, in the territory of Geghama Mountains, in Sevan pass, in the region of Aparan, in highlands between Sisian and Goris, in the region of Meghri. Monitoring of the wind potential at Sotk pass in Gegharkunik region has been completed by Zod Wind CJSC private company. The company is negotiating with different organizations to attract the investment for construction of the Zod wind farm, with planned installed capacity of 20 MW. Monitoring of wind potential at Karakhach pass in Shirak region has been completed by Ar Energy, Armenian - Italian private company. The company is planning to construct the Qaraqhach 1 wind farm, with initial planned capacity of 20 MW, which will be enlarged later up to 140 MW. Proposed Investments Projects In the framework of the EU TACIS program \u201cAssistance to Energy Policy of Armenia\u201d, monitoring work has been carried at Semyonovka pass in Sevan region and the pre-feasibility study for construction of a wind power plant with total installed capacity of 34 MW was prepared. Acciona Energy Global SL (Spain) By the Memorandum of Understanding signed on March 30, 2017 between the Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of RA and Acciona Energy Global SL on Wind Power Plant Construction Program in Armenia, it is foreseen to construct wind power plants with capacity of 100-150 MW. In December 2017, the company started implementation of the wind potential assessment. Two 80 meter wind monitoring stations and one Sodar system were installed. Each station is equipped with 8 anemometers, 3 weathercocks, 2 thermo-hygrometers and 1 atmospheric pressure gauge. Access Infra Central Asia Limited (United Arab Emirates) According to relevant decision of the GoA dated March 30, 2017, assistance is provided to Access Infra Central Asia Limited (UAE) for construction of wind power stations in Armenia with capacity up to 150 MW. USAID.GOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 | 119 A wind monitoring Station of 80 meters height has been installed, which is expected to be operated soon, and another was planned to be installed in April 2018. 7.1.1.4 OTHERS Geothermal energy Investigations have been conducted to reveal the precise sites of geothermal energy sources for possible construction of geothermal power plants. One of these sites is Jermaghbyur where, according to geological and geophysical explorations, a high pressure (20-25 atmosphere pressure) hot water (at up to 250\u0585C) resource is considered to be available at a depth of 2,500 -3,000 meters. If confirmed, it would be possible to construct a geothermal power plant with 25 MW capacity in this area. Biogas Biomass is not widely used as a power or gas source in Armenia. Annual potential of Armenia for receiving biogas is about 135 million m3 and the country have just initiated its utilization. A contract between Yerevan Municipality and Japan Shimizu Corporation was signed for implementation of the Nubarashen Solid Waste Landfill Gas Capture and Power Generation Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Project in Yerevan. According to the calculations of Shimizu Corporation, implementation of each phase of the mentioned project would result in annual creation of certificated reduction of CO2 emissions equal at least 56,000 tons. Bioethanol The Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund of Armenia, with the assistance of a WB and GEF grant has organized a study on \u201cAssessment of Bioethanol Production, Potential Utilization and Perspectives in Armenia\u201d in which the project of bioethanol production potential is prepared for investors. 120 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN: 2020-2036 USAID.GOV APPENDIX 3.
