Agency for International Development World Bank\nSecond National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable\nResources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Energy\nefficiency policy has  pivotal role to play in Armenia\u2019 economy: It is essential\nfor creating conditions for economic growth while improving energy security By\nreducing the energy intensity of the national economic output, energy efficiency\nholds the key to maintaining  safe, sustainable and affordable energy supply,\nwhile meeting increasing energy demand and improving quality of life for the\nArmenian population Under conditions of extreme import dependence for fossil\nfuels, energy that Armenia\u2019 citizens, businesses, and infrastructure do not use\nis the cheapest, cleanest, and most secure energy resource The potential for\nenergy efficiency in all sectors has been assessed repeatedly and remains high,\ndespite the relatively low energy intensity of the economy The Armenian\nGovernment has taken legal action to promote efficiency through various programs\nand policies, but the potential for efficiency improvement still remains largely\nuntapped With energy prices rising, the urgency of accelerating the uptake of\nenergy efficiency throughout Armenia\u2019 economy has increased The goal of the\nsecond National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) is to assess the\neffectiveness of ongoing efforts by the Government, donors, international\nfinancial institutions and the private sector to improve the efficiency of\nenergy use since 2010, when Armenia\u2019 first NEEAP was developed The second NEEAP\nalso identifies barriers to more extensive efforts in this direction, proposes\nmeasures to help overcome these barriers, and offers additional energy\nefficiency improvement measures for the period covering 2015\u2013The key pillars of\nthe second NEEAP are: \uf076 Reducing energy demand by improving the efficiency of\nenergy end use; \uf076 Improving national energy security by reducing the need for\nimported energy resources; \uf076 Decreasing the energy content of the key economic\noutputs to reduce costs and raise the competitiveness of output; \uf076 Addressing\ngrowing energy affordability concerns through energy efficiency solutions\n(instead of relying on social aid); and \uf076 Providing impetus for behavioral\nchange by decoupling growth from energy use, and thus enhancing the quality and\nsustainability of development through the introduction of knowledge and\ntraditions for resource efficiency and smart growth The development and adoption\nof the Second NEEAP for the Republic of Armenia is one of the steps on the\npathway upon which the Government of Armenia embarked  decade ago, by adopting\nArmenia\u2019 first Law on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy The Republic of Armenia\ndeveloped its first NEEAP in 2010 to accelerate the implementation of its\nnational energy efficiency policy The first NEEAP set forth  set of programmatic\nand policy measures for energy efficiency improvement for all economic sectors\nof the country The first NEEAP, adopted by Government Resolution #43 on\nNovember 2010, set the country on track for  ten-year process with intermediate\ntargets and interim evaluations Because adequate data  Second National Energy\nEfficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy\nEfficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT were not available at the time for developing\ntargets based on statistics, the first NEEAP provided rough estimates of the\npotential impact of the proposed measures as fractions of the overall target up\nto The 2010 energy balance was prepared shortly after the completion of the\nfirst NEEAP The indicative target for the end of the first NEEAP was thus later\nquantified by the team developing the second NEEAP using the energy balance data\nfor Since the second NEEAP was prepared in 2015, the first period was assumed to\ncover 2011-The energy saving target for the first period of the first NEEAP was\nbaseline energy consumption of 2010 (ktoe) The second NEEAP sets an interim\ntarget of %, equivalent to ktoe The assessment of the first NEEAP revealed that\nthis target has been outperformed: The overall energy saving reached by 2014 was\n% (ktoe) The second NEEAP continues the relevant measures from the first NEEAP,\nand in addition proposes an updated bundle of measures and energy saving targets\nfor the second period, covering 2015-The second NEEAP tracks both the indicative\nmilestone year 2018, as well as  long-term plan until The document was prepared\nbased on the template recommended by the Energy Community, in which the Republic\nof Armenia has had observer status since In accordance with the NEEAP\nmethodology, the baseline used in the second NEEAP is the average energy\nconsumption from three consecutive years (2010, 2011 and 2012), in this case\n,047 ktoe Based on the assessed progress under the first NEEAP and the expected\nimpact of the ongoing and new energy efficiency improvement measures, the second\nNEEAP proposes  new set of targets for 2017 (% instead

measures for all\nsectors The broad range of measures includes enforcing new regulations,\nintegrating energy efficiency into public procurement, encouraging improved\nenergy performance of industrial and small and medium enterprise (SME) energy\nconsumers, and introducing  comprehensive monitoring and planning approach for\nthe transport sector In addition, the measures include promoting end-use\ndistributed generation of renewable electricity and thermal energy by energy\nend-users This\u2014primarily includes the increased use of solar energy for hot\nwater preparation and the application of heat pumps and increased use of solar\nphotovoltaic technology via net metering These proposed measures are based on\nand  Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable\nResources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT closely related to existing\nstrategic documents, action plans and programs to promote renewable energy The\nnational intermediate indicative targets for 2017 and onward were calculated on\nthe basis of the average final consumption of energy during the realization of\nfirst NEEAP Table   National indicative targets for 2017

these individual actions\nare difficult to evaluate separately due to their synergistic natures and\noverlapping results -- particularly in the case of horizontal and cross-sectoral\nmeasures For this reason,  combination of top- down and bottom-up methodologies\nwas used to estimate the achieved (2014) and potential (through 2020) energy\nsaving impacts of these programs (see Table )  Second

through implementation of the energy efficiency measures proposed in the\nsecond NEEAP, it is necessary to strengthen Armenia\u2019 institutional framework,\nespecially related to buildings Several steps forward have already been taken in\nthis regard: For example, the newly adopted Housing Legislation stipulates that\nevery multi- apartment facility must operate as  legal entity, requiring\nresidents to form  community of building tenants or delegate the housing\nmaintenance function to  professional organization This legislation, combined\nwith the enforcement of the amended Law on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy\nand the related secondary legislation, will enable faster renovation of multi-\napartment buildings In addition, the increased establishment of Home-Owners\nAssociations will ensure  higher quality of housing maintenance and,\npotentially, increased efforts at thermal modernization of buildings This is an\nexpected outcome of the establishment of private maintenance companies and the\nenhanced development of energy services companies (ESCOs) The Ministry of Energy\nand Natural Resources (MoENR) is responsible for monitoring the implementation\nof the second NEEAP and reporting results based on measurement and verification\nof energy savings As  first step, the MoENR will need to establish an\ninformation system for tracking all energy efficiency activities and assessing\nthe energy savings; this will help avoid measurement and verification problems\nstemming from the current lack of data (apparent during the preparation of this\nNEEAP) needed to calculate the savings from individual measures This task may be\nassigned (outsourced), if necessary, to expert teams outside MoENR The\nimplementation of the second NEEAP will also require identification of stable\nfunding sources to support the measures that depend on extra-budgetary sources\nof financing;   Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan

steps to reform the energy sector, improve the economic efficiency of\nenergy use and promote the greter use of renewables Several policy documents,\nsuch as the Energy Sector Development Strategy, the Law on Energy Saving and\nRenewable Energy, the National Program on Energy Saving and Renewables, the\nfirst National Energy Efficiency Action Plan and the Energy Security Concept\nhave all clearly voiced the priotity that the Government of Armenia attributes\nto development of renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy saving\nprograms, diversification by primary energy sources and supply routes, regional\nintegration, as well as development of nuclear energy The Republic of Armenia\nhas developed its first National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) in 2010\nfor the period 2010 \u2013 2014 as part of the overall attempts to accelerate the\nimplementation of the national energy efficiency policy The first NEEAP set\nforth  set of programmatic and policy measures for energy efficiency improvement\nfor all relevant economic sectors in the country According to the European best\npractices, development of NEEAP is  regular process and targets at  ten-year\nperiod The first NEEAP was developed without adequate statistical basis, but\nprovided rough estimates of the potential impact of the proposed bundle of\nmeasures as fractions of the overall target up to 2020 (adopted by Goevrnment\nResolution #43 from  November The present document is the second NEEAP in this\nseries and provides the Government of Armenia with an assessment of progress\nagainst these targets during the period of  using the estimated baseline energy\nconsumption for Due to the experienced delay in the preparation of the second\nNEEAP, the first NEEAP assessment goes beyond the reported timeframe for the\nfirst period and tracks programs and measures implemented up to 2014, inclusive\nThe second EEAP uses the 1st NEEAP assessment conducted by the R2E2 for\nhorizontal/cross-cutting measures, newly conducted assessment of implemented\nsectoral programs as foundation to, where necessary, revise the current measures\nand establish  new sectoral measures in order to ensure the achievement of\nobjectives by year 2017, 2018 and Then the second NEEAP continues the relevant\nmeasures from the first NEEAP, as well as proposes an updated bundle of measures\nand energy saving targets for the second period covering , tracking both the\nindicative milestone year 2018, as well as  long-term plan until The document\nwas prepared based on the template recommended by the Energy Community which the\nRepublic of Armenia holds an observer status since The NEEAP provides  framework\nfor the development of measures to enhance energy efficiency improvement, with\nstronger focus on the energy end-use, and platform to evaluate the energy\nsavingsresulting from the implementation of these measures in the long run The\nmethod and specific features of the assessment of the total and intermediate\nindicative targets are described in this documentAggregate and individual data\non energy consumption have been used to set the targets  Second National Energy\nEfficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy\nEfficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT based on the  energy balance data Where possible,\ntotal primary sources and final energy consuption was roughly assessed beyond\n2012 to allow for adequate assessment of the impact of the first NEEAP measures\nThe updates in the second NEEAP are largely aimed at documenting  diverse\npackage of measures that have been undertaken by various players in all sectors\nof the economy, new initiatives that have been introduced after the first NEEAP\nwas developed, as well as refreshing the data on timing for implementation of\nenergy efficiency (EE) improvement measures in the light of growing energy\nprices and emerging energy supply sufficiency concerns The legal ground for\npreparation of EEAP is determined in the Government Decree adopting the 1st\nNEEAPThe second EEAP for the period , considering targeted energy efficiency\nsavings by 2018 and 2020, prescribes the energy savings objectives and\nprescribes measures and activities for achieving intermediate energy savings\ntarget for The 2nd NEEAP will provide  framework for the development of measures\nto enhance energy efficiency improvement, in particular for end-use energy\nconsumers, and platform to evaluate the energy savings resulting from the\nimplementation of these measures  Enhancing Capacity for Low Emission\nDevelopment Strategies (EC-LEDS) Program in Armenia Available at   Second\nNational Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources\nand Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT  OVERALL CONTEXT OF THE SECOND NEEAP The\nArmenian Government has developed and adopted several major national policies,\nstrategies and programs, secondary legislations and regulatory frameworks as\nwell as international treaties related to the implementation of energy\nefficiency policies The chart below lists the acting policies, programs,\nregulations and treaties governing the scope of NEEAP implementation Figure\nEnergy Efficiency Policies, Strategies and Regulations The review of the above\npolicy framework is attached to the Second NEEAP with consideration of\naccomplished energy savings as well as expected savings from continued policy\nefforts in market transformation in the consequent chapters, as well as further\nreform recommendations The desk study revealed the gaps in the policies,\nincluding: \uf0b7 The lack of financial incentives for energy efficiency to support\nthe enforcement of the voluntary provisions of the Law on Energy Saving and\nRenewable Energy \uf0b7 The lack of enforcement in the existing energy efficiency\nregulations, including enforcement procedures for the latest Government decree\non mandatory compliance with EE requirements in state investment projects and\nresidential construction  Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for\nArmenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT \uf0b7\nnumber of legislative initiatives have been put forward (technical regulations\non building safety and energy performance, amendments to the Law on Urban\nDevelopment, draft amendments to the Law on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy,\ndraft regulation on appliance labeling), which are still pending adoption or on\nhold Their status as well as impact on national energy saving targets must be\nreassessed to conclude on recommended further steps in these reform directions\nFurthermore, the present legal initiatives, particularly those related to\nappliance labeling, must be revisited to adjust the provisions of the earlier\ndraft regulation on appliance labeling targeted at EU Labeling directive\ntransposition to comply with the EEU \uf0b7 Many donor- and IFI-funded initiatives\nhave already tested  number of  successful and promising technical and financial\nsolutions for promotion of energy efficiency in various sectors of the economy\nThese have also provided solid empirical evidences on the expected impact of\nparticular energy efficiency measures, as well as potential barriers which can\nhamper the successful implementation of specific energy efficiency measures The\nsecond NEEAP seeks to propose scaling these up to national efforts Similarly,\nthe assessment of the first NEEAP and the work on thesecond NEEAP revealed\nlimited attention to other types of EE Investments, hence the second NEEAP seeks\nto propose  new set of EE improvement measures and programs addressing the\nmarket barriers and utilizing the untapped energy saving potential in other\nsectors  Highlights of the Second NEEAP The second NEEAP assesses the progress\nmade in the directions outlined by the first NEEAP The intention was to use the\naverage energy demand for  as the reference, but since the energy balance was\nonly calculated for 2010 and further two years, 2010 was the only reference for\nbaseline But since the first NEEAP, the 2010, 2011 and 2012 energy balances were\nprepared, and the following target yeras (2017, 2018 and 2020) use the average\nof these three consecutive years as  reference baseline for the consequent\nenergy saving targets  Second

Figure )\nand the necessary shut-down under-maintained infrastructure, including about\n,300 operable power generation facilities, have resulted in the need for new\npower-generating capacities to be to meet an in order constructed envisaged\nsupply gap in 2017 (World Bank, 2011) The operable capacity of the current\nNuclear Power Plant (NPP) cannot be increased and hydro energy is dependent

FIRST DRAFT\nArmenia\u2019 first National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) was developed in\n2010 when there was no detailed energy balance in the country and the latest\nbottom-up data collection was conducted in 2005 for the development of the\nNational Program on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy, adopted in The lack of\nstatistical data limited the possibility of assessing the energy saving\npotential adequately, as well as quantifying the indicative energy saving\ntargets  Setting the Target As  best-practice strategy for NEEAPs, the baseline\nis selected based on the average of the three consecutive years for which\nadequate statistics were available Given the availability of detailed energy\nbalance for  in Armenia, the present NEEAP uses the average of these three years\nto set the baseline This NEEAP also uses the energy intensity of GDP, sectoral\nenergy intensities, as well as primary or final energy use per capita Similarly,\nthe targets set by the Government for national programs and strategies aimed at\nenergy efficiency usually use primary or final energy sources used by  target\nyear The NEEAP is no exception Energy efficiency targets for the NEEAPs can be\nset based on: \u203a primary or final energy consumption; \u203a primary or final energy\nsavings; \u203a energy intensity Considering that the energy system losses are\nestimated by various studies at approximately 30%, and that the second NEEAP\nalso focuses on supply-side energy efficiency measures, which will also deliver\nsubstantial primary energy saving  TPES target will be better for Armenia\u2019\neconomy with consideration of the resource efficiency, economic competitiveness\nand energy security considerations As recommended by the European best\npractices, and for the ease of use and monitoring, Armenia\u2019 second NEEAP also\nexpresses those targets in terms of an absolute level of primary energy\nconsumption and final energy consumption in 2020 and shall explain how, and on\nthe basis of which data, this must be calculated The comparison of total primary\nenergy consumption in the CIS countries\u2014among them Armenia and Georgia acting as\nobservers to the EnC Treaty and Ukraine and Moldova acting as contracting\nparties\u2014 shows that TPES consumption in Armenia is the second lowest in the\nregion (See) As noted above, this does not necessarily act as an indicator of\nefficiency, but rather shows  lack of technological advancement and economic\ndevelopment, as well as heavy reliance on service sectors These factors allowed\nArmenia\u2019 GDP to grow faster than its energy consumption 11 Second National\nEnergy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy\nEfficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT

energy savings potential and its ability to pay for the\nnecessary investments, , their current GDP and its future changes Hence,\nArmenia\u2019 target is decoupled from any absolute quantitative target and  linkage\nis proposed to the enforcement and effectiveness of national policies, energy\nefficiency financing, promotion of energy services and the provision of\ninformation Such  target is tied to quality of growth, reducing the energy\ncontent of the output without geopardizing the economic development of the\ncountry As the graph below indicates, Armenia has already made some progress

certain hydro-\nenergy resources and  small amount of other renewables (including some fire-\nwood, the consumption of which led to severe deforestation), Armenia does not\npossess any own conventional (fossil and nuclear) fuel resources and is not\ntransit country for oil and gas as well Thus, the country is heavily dependent\non energy imports, which has placed an increasing burden on the current account\nIn 2012 energy imports amounted to 90% of the total of 377 Mtoe primary energy\nsupplied The share of energy imports in TPES fluctuates slightly depending on\nthe hydro potential In dry years, imports increase Although reduced during the\nrecent years, overall energy losses are still high About 30% of the total\nprimary energy supplied was lost through transformation, transmission and\ndistribution (USAID, 2014) This underlines the importance of energy\ninfrastructure improvement and EE development This is the reason why the IFI\nsupport requested by the Armenian Government in the energy sector also largely\nfocuses on loss reduction, reliability and increased effectiveness of the\ndistribution networks All EE measures that are provided by this program are\nmeasures for reduction of energy consumption among end users The same applies\nand for EE measures which are taken in the power plants that generate\nelectricity and thermal energy It is necessary to emphasize that the\nimplementation of measures at the site of energy end users is considerably more\nconducive to reducing the consumption of primary energy, compared to power\nplants that generate energy The reason for this lies in the fact that the\ngeneration of energy, except losses during transformation of primary into\nsecondary form of energy, appear and additional losses of transmission and\ndistribution  Reducing high-voltage network losses and Enhancing reliability of\nPower Supply in Armenia Optimal approach is to predict the energy efficiency\nmeasures in all steps \u2013 at the side of power supply (production of transformed\nform of energy, transport, distribution) and at the side of the energy end users\nTable  Energy Losses in the Armenian Energy System per

of Armenia (UCORA) 52 Second\nNational Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources\nand Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT happen? There are two strong reasons\nhere: ) it conforms that LFIs has not any effective currency risk mitigation\ntools, experience and capacity, and in lack of these lending in foreign currency\nis more attractive for LFIs ) Most of LFIs preferred turn to lending to foreign\ncurrency loans when provided refinancing of local currency loans The main\nconclusion is that LFIs pay strong attention to currency risk mitigation, and\ncurrency risk is  determining factor for EE investments The share of EE projects\nin total loans disbursed by LFIs decreased for loans in both local and foreign\ncurrency22 (see table below)The main conclusion is that EE lending become less\nattractive for LFIs, plus there is  huge share of loan refinancing, which\nincreased in 2010-Table Total loans

re-qualify loan from \"EE\" to \"ordinary usually in\nprocess of refinancing ) We can see that drop of loans in Local currency about -\ntimes faster than in foreign currency It is obvious that trend to turn to\nforeign currency lending is not attractive for EE project hosts and developers\nAmount of EE / RE Loans provided by LFIs, including International Financial\nInstitutions\u2019 (IFI) funds, increased from $74 mln in 2010 to $78mln in 2015,\n71% per year, which is about 72 times less than the annual GDP growth rate So,\nArmenia had about $340 mln unutilized EE investment potential in

of EE loans disbursed by UCOs increased from 92% to 97%\nreaching the largest share in 2012 at about 45% The trend proves that UCOs\nbecome one of key players in EE investment In Armenia, especially

respect to its energy security, economic stability, social\nand environmental protection and the Government of the Republic of Armenia has\nregularly emphasized the importance it attaches to energy efficiency improvement\nboth in existing and newly constructed buildings Moreover, most of the\ninvestments in energy efficiency in buildings have positive economic features\nand can be financed with loan financing under close-to-commercial terms However,\nthere are  number of persistent barriers, such as legislative, institutional,\nsocio-economic, and low-awareness that impede large-scale uptake of energy\nefficiency investments in the market In particular, it is suggested that the\ngovernment take the following urgent steps: To eliminate the barriers in the\nlegal framework for energy efficiency:  Introduce binding legislation ( new law\nor  technical regulation) stipulating energy auditing, passportization,\ncertification and labeling of buildings, mandatory enforcement of building\nenergy codes with compulsory application to new buildings as well as with\ngradual application to already existing ones26 to harmonize with energy\nefficiency certification (EEC) policy and regulatory requirements and EU\nDirective on Energy Performance Indicators in Buildings  The legal reform in the\nfield of energy saving and energy efficiency to ECU membership and transposition\nof the ECU regulations To implement this approach the following steps will be\nnecessary:  Make appropriate changes and amendments in the Law on Urban\nDevelopment allowing to stipulate mandatory norms for energy efficiency in\ndesign, construction and exploitation 26 It is noteworthy that, unlike other\nfields, this sector has  unique feature of energy efficiency mandatory\napplication In the field of industry, for instance, there are no incentives, no\nmixed private and common property areas, which would lead to inefficient use of\nenergy, and industry owners possess capital investment funds (own or borrowed)\nfor various modernization measures, including energy efficiency ones In\naddition, in the industrial sector, the energy efficiency requirements, if\nimposed by Government, despite the cross-cutting monetary and non-monetary\nbenefits, due to lack of awareness can be considered as an investment burden,\nbarrier to growing local production, which is not politically acceptable, and\nnot in line with the Government of RoA politics over the recent years to create\nfavorable investment climate for local producers and international investors\nWhile the public sector does not usually need strong legal instruments, as the\nGovernment has its internal tools to implement energy efficiency measures in the\npublic sector As for the residential sector, it has  complex ownership\nstructure, split interests in relation to private, rented and shared spaces,\nmixed property level in multi-apartment buildings; old buildings, limited access\nto capital, and  malfunctioning system of self-organization and collective\ndecision-making Therefore, in new buildings, where it is easier and less\nexpensive to implement, the energy efficiency should be  mandatory

leading to higher net\nenergy use per unit of output This is largely due to inefficient machinery (,\npumps) and irrational irrigation water use (, over-irrigating), as well as the\ntransition from largely manual agricultural practices to more technology- and\nmachinery-driven practices According to the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) of the\nRepublic of Armenia, 93% of existing agricultural

also\nenvisages the consolidation of farms and development of agrarian cooperatives,\nthe improvement of credit, the development of risk mitigation measures, the\ndevelopment of organic agriculture, efforts to reduce vulnerability to climate\nchange, and the development of social infrastructure in rural communities As\nnoted, the growth in energy consumption in the agricultural sector has been\nlargely attributed to the aging fleet of agricultural machinery, and the\ntransition from manual processes to machine- 112 Second National Energy\nEfficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy\nEfficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT driven agricultural processes (with new machinery\nadded even before the old fleet is phased out) In addition, there has\nbeensignificant growth in the greenhouse industry as well as increasing\nirrigation demand to meet the growing demand for agricultural crops and an\nincreasing amount of aquaculture (fish nurseries) Thus, these

cultured fish production \u2013 aquaculture in fish nurseries31A\nFood and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) study has\nestimated that, as of 2011,Armenia\u2019 total annual fish production is ,000\u2013,500\ntons from 233 fish farms occupying about ,720 hectares This sector is also\ngrowing rapidly Since regulations now require that fish farms circulate the\ndeep-water well groundwater that they extract for fisheries, the electricity use\nin this sector is expected to increase dramatically To mitigate the energy\nimpact of this practice, it will be necessary to develop and implement energy\nefficiency solutions for cultured fish production technology  case study by the\nRegional Environmental Center revealed significant potential for energy resource\nefficiency in one of the operating fisheries sized hectares: Almost 200 MWh of\nelectricity can be saved annuallyjust by upgrading the air compression and\nconditioning technology This represents  17% reduction in energy costs\nassociated with fish production at this site It is noteworthy that these energy\nefficiency measures also improve the feeding efficiency and productivity of the\nfishery overall Considering the growing significance of this sector in Armenia,\nproviding fish nurseries with technical assistance and access to affordable\nfinance should be  priority It is important to note that energy solutions in the\nfisheries subsector overlap with those inthe industrial sector, considering the\nindustrial scales of many fisheries enterprises as well as the further\nprocessing and packaging of raw fish into ready food products The proposed\nactivities for the industry sector related to ISO 50001, resource efficiency and\nclean production and introduction of best available technologies are thus\nrelevant for the fisheries sector and should be included in proposed measures\nfor aquaculture/fish nurseries Since 2010, when the first NEEAP was developed,\nthe Government of Armenia and  number of donors and IFIs have implemented  wide\nrange of programs that have implicitly or explicitly delivered energy efficiency\nmeasures to the agricultural sector These programs have included improvement of\nirrigation networks and water supply facilities, upgrading machinery and\nequipment, modernization of aquaculture and greenhouses to serve the broader\nobjectives of 31

Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT COMPETENT BODIES AND ASSIGNED\nORGANIZATIONS Energy efficiency policy has  pivotal role to play in Armenia\u2019\neconomy: It is essential for creating conditions for economic growth while\nimproving energy security By reducing the energy intensity of the national\neconomic output, energy efficiency holds the key to maintaining  safe,\nsustainable and affordable energy supply, while meeting increasing energy demand\nand improving quality of life for the Armenian population Under conditions of\nextreme import dependence for fossil fuels, energy that Armenia\u2019 citizens,\nbusinesses, and infrastructure do not use is the cheapest, cleanest, and most\nsecure energy resource The potential for energy efficiency in all sectors has\nbeen assessed repeatedly and remains high, despite the relatively low energy\nintensity of the economy The Armenian Government has promoted energy efficiency\nthrough various programs and policies, but the overall potential for efficiency\nimprovement still remains largely untapped With energy prices rising, the\nurgency of accelerating the uptake of energy efficiency throughout Armenia\u2019\neconomy has increased The goal of the second National Energy Efficiency Action\nPlan (NEEAP) is to assess the effectiveness of ongoing efforts by the\nGovernment, donors, international financial institutions and the private sector\nto improve the efficiency of energy use since 2010, when Armenia\u2019 first NEEAP\nwas developed The second NEEAP also identifies barriers to more extensive\nefforts in this direction, proposes measures to help overcome these barriers,\nand offers additional energy efficiency improvement measures for the period\ncovering 2015\u2013The key pillars of the second NEEAP are: \uf0b7 Reducing energy demand\nby improving the efficiency of energy end use; \uf0b7 Improving national energy\nsecurity by reducing the need for imported energy resources; \uf0b7 Decreasing the\nenergy content of the key economic outputs to reduce costs and raise the\ncompetitiveness of output; \uf0b7 Addressing growing energy affordability concerns\nthrough energy efficiency solutions (instead of relying on social aid); and \uf0b7\nProviding impetus for behavioral change by decoupling growth from energy use,\nand thus enhancing the quality and sustainability of development through the\nintroduction of knowledge and traditions for resource efficiency and smart\ngrowth The development and adoption of the Second NEEAP for the Republic of\nArmenia is one of the steps on the pathway upon which the Government of Armenia\nembarked  decade ago, by adopting Armenia\u2019 first Law on Energy Saving and\nRenewable Energy The 212 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for\nArmenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT\nRepublic of Armenia developed its first NEEAP in 2010 to accelerate the\nimplementation of its national energy efficiency policy The first NEEAP set\nforth  set of programmatic and policy measures for energy efficiency improvement\nfor all economic sectors of the country The first NEEAP, adopted by Government\nResolution #43 on  November 2010, set the country on track for  ten-year process\nwith intermediate targets and interim evaluations Because adequate data were not\navailable at the time for developing targets based on statistics, the first\nNEEAP provided rough estimates of the potential impact of the proposed measures\nas fractions of the overall target up to The successful implementation of the\nenergy policy of the Republic of Armenia depends on the active engagement of all\nstakeholders in the sector The realization of the secon NEEAP is  necessity All\nplanned measures should be implemented to achieve the anticipated results None\nof them has  low priority, all individually and as  whole are necessary The\napplication of EE measures reduces dependence on imports of primary and\ntransformed energy, decreases environmental pollution, improving the living\nconditions of citizens (less pollution, better health conditions, lower energy\ncosts), create new jobs While the Table 39 summarises the roles and\nresponsibilities of the key stakeholders with respective investments necessary\nfor each of the EE improvement measure, the role of the Ministry of Energy and\nNatural Resources (MoENR) must be additionally emphasized The existing\norganizational structure in the field of energy efficiency policy has been\npriority measure in the first NEEAP and the NEEAP proposed establishment of an\nEnergy Efficiency Agency This activity was not implemented De facto, R2E2 has\nbeen tasked with many functions of an EE Agency The R2E2 is well positioned for\nthis role, but the administrative capacities within MoENR are scarce with very\nlimited capacity and cadre for the implementation of the national policy of\nenergy efficiency This situation of understaffed bodies responsible for the\noverall implementation and monitoring of energy efficiency policy can cause\ndelays in the execution of the obligations These capacities are also necessary\nto
