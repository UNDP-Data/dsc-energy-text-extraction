By reducing the energy intensity of the national economic output, energy efficiency holds the key to maintaining a safe, sustainable and affordable energy supply, while meeting increasing energy demand and improving quality of life for the Armenian population. Under conditions of extreme import dependence for fossil fuels, energy that Armenia\u2019s citizens, businesses, and infrastructure do not use is the cheapest, cleanest, and most secure energy resource. The potential for energy efficiency in all sectors has been assessed repeatedly and remains high, despite the relatively low energy intensity of the economy. The Armenian Government has taken legal action to promote efficiency through various programs and policies, but the potential for efficiency improvement still remains largely untapped. With energy prices rising, the urgency of accelerating the uptake of energy efficiency throughout Armenia\u2019s economy has increased. The goal of the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) is to assess the effectiveness of ongoing efforts by the Government, donors, international financial institutions and the private sector to improve the efficiency of energy use since 2010, when Armenia\u2019s first NEEAP was developed. The second NEEAP also identifies barriers to more extensive efforts in this direction, proposes measures to help overcome these barriers, and offers additional energy efficiency improvement measures for the period covering 2015\u20132020. The key pillars of the second NEEAP are: \uf076 Reducing energy demand by improving the efficiency of energy end use; \uf076 Improving national energy security by reducing the need for imported energy resources; \uf076 Decreasing the energy content of the key economic outputs to reduce costs and raise the competitiveness of output; \uf076 Addressing growing energy affordability concerns through energy efficiency solutions (instead of relying on social aid); and \uf076 Providing impetus for behavioral change by decoupling growth from energy use, and thus enhancing the quality and sustainability of development through the introduction of knowledge and traditions for resource efficiency and smart growth. The development and adoption of the Second NEEAP for the Republic of Armenia is one of the steps on the pathway upon which the Government of Armenia embarked a decade ago, by adopting Armenia\u2019s first Law on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy. The Republic of Armenia developed its first NEEAP in 2010 to accelerate the implementation of its national energy efficiency policy. The first NEEAP set forth a set of programmatic and policy measures for energy efficiency improvement for all economic sectors of the country. The first NEEAP, adopted by Government Resolution #43 on 4 November 2010, set the country on track for a ten-year process with intermediate targets and interim evaluations. Because adequate data 3 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT were not available at the time for developing targets based on statistics, the first NEEAP provided rough estimates of the potential impact of the proposed measures as fractions of the overall target up to 2020. The 2010 energy balance was prepared shortly after the completion of the first NEEAP. The indicative target for the end of the first NEEAP was thus later quantified by the team developing the second NEEAP using the energy balance data for 2010.1 Since the second NEEAP was prepared in 2015, the first period was assumed to cover 2011-2014. The energy saving target for the first period of the first NEEAP was baseline energy consumption of 2010 (1900.6 ktoe). The second NEEAP sets an interim target of 3.3%, equivalent to 63.3 ktoe. The assessment of the first NEEAP revealed that this target has been outperformed: The overall energy saving reached by 2014 was 6.3% (120.3 ktoe). The second NEEAP continues the relevant measures from the first NEEAP, and in addition proposes an updated bundle of measures and energy saving targets for the second period, covering 2015-2017. The second NEEAP tracks both the indicative milestone year 2018, as well as a long-term plan until 2020. The document was prepared based on the template recommended by the Energy Community, in which the Republic of Armenia has had observer status since 01.10.2011. In accordance with the NEEAP methodology, the baseline used in the second NEEAP is the average energy consumption from three consecutive years (2010, 2011 and 2012), in this case 2,047 ktoe. Based on the assessed progress under the first NEEAP and the expected impact of the ongoing and new energy efficiency improvement measures, the second NEEAP proposes a new set of targets for 2017 (9.9% instead of the 10.4% proposed in the first NEEAP), 1 EC-LEDS Program In Armenia. 4 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT for 2018 (11.2% instead of 13.8%), and a higher overall target for 2020 (34.2% instead of 22.3%).

For this reason, the reduced targets of the second NEEAP may be outperformed when energy efficiency financing is quantified in the third NEEAP. Table 0. 2.

The broad range of measures includes enforcing new regulations, integrating energy efficiency into public procurement, encouraging improved energy performance of industrial and small and medium enterprise (SME) energy consumers, and introducing a comprehensive monitoring and planning approach for the transport sector. In addition, the measures include promoting end-use distributed generation of renewable electricity and thermal energy by energy end-users. This\u2014primarily includes the increased use of solar energy for hot water preparation and the application of heat pumps and increased use of solar photovoltaic technology via net metering. These proposed measures are based on and 6 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT closely related to existing strategic documents, action plans and programs to promote renewable energy. The national intermediate indicative targets for 2017 and onward were calculated on the basis of the average final consumption of energy during the realization of first NEEAP. Table 0. 4.

The impacts of these individual actions are difficult to evaluate separately due to their synergistic natures and overlapping results -- particularly in the case of horizontal and cross-sectoral measures. For this reason, a combination of top- down and bottom-up methodologies was used to estimate the achieved (2014) and potential (through 2020) energy saving impacts of these programs (see Table 0.4). 7 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Table 0. 5.

Several steps forward have already been taken in this regard: For example, the newly adopted Housing Legislation stipulates that every multi- apartment facility must operate as a legal entity, requiring residents to form a community of building tenants or delegate the housing maintenance function to a professional organization. This legislation, combined with the enforcement of the amended Law on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy and the related secondary legislation, will enable faster renovation of multi- apartment buildings. In addition, the increased establishment of Home-Owners Associations will ensure a higher quality of housing maintenance and, potentially, increased efforts at thermal modernization of buildings. This is an expected outcome of the establishment of private maintenance companies and the enhanced development of energy services companies (ESCOs). The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MoENR) is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the second NEEAP and reporting results based on measurement and verification of energy savings. As a first step, the MoENR will need to establish an information system for tracking all energy efficiency activities and assessing the energy savings; this will help avoid measurement and verification problems stemming from the current lack of data (apparent during the preparation of this NEEAP) needed to calculate the savings from individual measures. This task may be assigned (outsourced), if necessary, to expert teams outside MoENR. The implementation of the second NEEAP will also require identification of stable funding sources to support the measures that depend on extra-budgetary sources of financing; a 8 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT number of measures outlined in the second NEEAP still do not have committed funding. A small part of the budgetary resources (Central and Local) are still available to be allocated for the drafting of the policies, development of tariff reform, and preparation of programs within the specific measures; however, significant additional funding necessary for the implementation of the energy efficiency investments will be required from donors and IFIs. Table 0.5 summarizes all of the energy efficiency measures in the sectors of final energy consumption that are outlined in the proposed second NEEAP, as well as the assigned responsibilities for implementation and the estimated funds required. A more precise assessment of necessary financial resources, as well as proposed sources of financing, will be elaborated in the programs and plans for the implementation of specific energy efficiency measures identified in this NEEAP.

Several policy documents, such as the Energy Sector Development Strategy, the Law on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy, the National Program on Energy Saving and Renewables, the first National Energy Efficiency Action Plan and the Energy Security Concept have all clearly voiced the priotity that the Government of Armenia attributes to development of renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy saving programs, diversification by primary energy sources and supply routes, regional integration, as well as development of nuclear energy. The Republic of Armenia has developed its first National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) in 2010 for the period 2010 \u2013 2014 as part of the overall attempts to accelerate the implementation of the national energy efficiency policy. The first NEEAP set forth a set of programmatic and policy measures for energy efficiency improvement for all relevant economic sectors in the country. According to the European best practices, development of NEEAP is a regular process and targets at a ten-year period. The first NEEAP was developed without adequate statistical basis, but provided rough estimates of the potential impact of the proposed bundle of measures as fractions of the overall target up to 2020 (adopted by Goevrnment Resolution #43 from 4 November 2010. The present document is the second NEEAP in this series and provides the Government of Armenia with an assessment of progress against these targets during the period of 2010-2012 using the estimated baseline energy consumption for 2010. Due to the experienced delay in the preparation of the second NEEAP, the first NEEAP assessment goes beyond the reported timeframe for the first period and tracks programs and measures implemented up to 2014, inclusive. The second EEAP uses the 1st NEEAP assessment conducted by the R2E2 for horizontal/cross-cutting measures, newly conducted assessment of implemented sectoral programs as foundation to, where necessary, revise the current measures and establish a new sectoral measures in order to ensure the achievement of objectives by year 2017, 2018 and 2020. Then the second NEEAP continues the relevant measures from the first NEEAP, as well as proposes an updated bundle of measures and energy saving targets for the second period covering 2015-2017, tracking both the indicative milestone year 2018, as well as a long-term plan until 2020. The document was prepared based on the template recommended by the Energy Community which the Republic of Armenia holds an observer status since 01.10.2011. The NEEAP provides a framework for the development of measures to enhance energy efficiency improvement, with a stronger focus on the energy end-use, and platform to evaluate the energy savingsresulting from the implementation of these measures in the long run. The method and specific features of the assessment of the total and intermediate indicative targets are described in this document.Aggregate and individual data on energy consumption have been used to set the targets 1 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT based on the 2010-2012 energy balance data.2 Where possible, total primary sources and final energy consuption was roughly assessed beyond 2012 to allow for adequate assessment of the impact of the first NEEAP measures. The updates in the second NEEAP are largely aimed at documenting a diverse package of measures that have been undertaken by various players in all sectors of the economy, new initiatives that have been introduced after the first NEEAP was developed, as well as refreshing the data on timing for implementation of energy efficiency (EE) improvement measures in the light of growing energy prices and emerging energy supply sufficiency concerns. The legal ground for preparation of EEAP is determined in the Government Decree adopting the 1st NEEAP.The second EEAP for the period 2015-2017, considering targeted energy efficiency savings by 2018 and 2020, prescribes the energy savings objectives and prescribes measures and activities for achieving intermediate energy savings target for 2017. The 2nd NEEAP will provide a framework for the development of measures to enhance energy efficiency improvement, in particular for end-use energy consumers, and platform to evaluate the energy savings resulting from the implementation of these measures. 2 Enhancing Capacity for Low Emission Development Strategies (EC-LEDS) Program in Armenia. Available at  2 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT 1 OVERALL CONTEXT OF THE SECOND NEEAP The Armenian Government has developed and adopted several major national policies, strategies and programs, secondary legislations and regulatory frameworks as well as international treaties related to the implementation of energy efficiency policies. The chart below lists the acting policies, programs, regulations and treaties governing the scope of NEEAP implementation. Figure 1. Energy Efficiency Policies, Strategies and Regulations The review of the above policy framework is attached to the Second NEEAP with consideration of accomplished energy savings as well as expected savings from continued policy efforts in market transformation in the consequent chapters, as well as further reform recommendations. The desk study revealed the gaps in the policies, including: \uf0b7 The lack of financial incentives for energy efficiency to support the enforcement of the voluntary provisions of the Law on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy \uf0b7 The lack of enforcement in the existing energy efficiency regulations, including enforcement procedures for the latest Government decree on mandatory compliance with EE requirements in state investment projects and residential construction 3 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT \uf0b7 A number of legislative initiatives have been put forward (technical regulations on building safety and energy performance, amendments to the Law on Urban Development, draft amendments to the Law on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy, draft regulation on appliance labeling), which are still pending adoption or on hold. Their status as well as impact on national energy saving targets must be reassessed to conclude on recommended further steps in these reform directions. Furthermore, the present legal initiatives, particularly those related to appliance labeling, must be revisited to adjust the provisions of the earlier draft regulation on appliance labeling targeted at EU Labeling directive transposition to comply with the EEU. \uf0b7 Many donor- and IFI-funded initiatives have already tested a number of a successful and promising technical and financial solutions for promotion of energy efficiency in various sectors of the economy. These have also provided solid empirical evidences on the expected impact of particular energy efficiency measures, as well as potential barriers which can hamper the successful implementation of specific energy efficiency measures. The second NEEAP seeks to propose scaling these up to national efforts. Similarly, the assessment of the first NEEAP and the work on thesecond NEEAP revealed limited attention to other types of EE Investments, hence the second NEEAP seeks to propose a new set of EE improvement measures and programs addressing the market barriers and utilizing the untapped energy saving potential in other sectors. 1.1 Highlights of the Second NEEAP The second NEEAP assesses the progress made in the directions outlined by the first NEEAP. The intention was to use the average energy demand for 2008-2010 as the reference, but since the energy balance was only calculated for 2010 and further two years, 2010 was the only reference for a baseline. But since the first NEEAP, the 2010, 2011 and 2012 energy balances were prepared, and the following target yeras (2017, 2018 and 2020) use the average of these three consecutive years as a reference baseline for the consequent energy saving targets. 4 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT 1.2 National context of energy savings Armenia\u2019s energy consumption currently represents only a small fraction of the level prior to collapse of the Soviet Union.

The restructuring of the economy with more focus on services and away from heavy industry has helped reduce the energy intensity of economic growth and decouple energy from growth which is a major step towards a sustainable energy pathway and green economy (See Error!

Nevertheless, both sectors make only insignificant contributions to GDP. Industry used only 18% of energy, which is far beyond the industry\u2019s share in the soviet era. Commercial and public services accounted for about 16% and agriculture - for about 7%. The share of the residential sector fluctuates depending on weather conditions. Only the commercial and the public service sector showed steady increase of energy consumption over the last years. Figure 4.

The share of all other sectors was expected to decrease. Practice seems to develop differently. The Long- Term Strategic Development Program of the Armenian Government 2014-2025 plans an annual economic growth of up to 6-7% and a doubling of GDP by 2025. Highly qualified jobs ensuring high labour productivity is considered as the main directions. The Program, in fact, may become a straightforward strategy for a country poor in natural resources. The envisaged work places indeed may be less energy-intensive. Therefore, in a reference scenario, one would expect an increase in energy consumption in commercial and public services. After the deep fuel crisis in 1992 when consumers had only 2-4 hours of electricity per day and most households depended on firewood or electricity for heating (World Bank, 2011), the electricity system 3Although the projections are not compatible with current development and need to be adjusted there was no other projection to rely on. Say explicitly that a new study is needed here. 6 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT has been restored. Electricity generation in Armenia relies mainly on natural gas (54% of total installed capacity) followed by hydropower (22% of installed capacity). The nuclear power plant built in the Soviet period is still in operation and contributes 19% of total installed capacity. Table 1.

A steadily growing electricity demand (see Figure 6) and the necessary shut-down under-maintained infrastructure, including about 1,300 operable power generation facilities, have resulted in the need for new power-generating capacities to be to meet an in order constructed envisaged supply gap in 2017 (World Bank, 2011). The operable capacity of the current Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) cannot be increased and hydro energy is dependent on weather conditions. Discharges from the Sevan Lake to the Sevan-Hrazdan cascade are limited and strongly depend on the irrigation regime. The working capacity of the Vorotan cascade power plants is also limited due to the water flow in in the river. Therefore the load of Vorotan cascade is highest during the spring-summer months and lowest during the autumn-winter months. The assessment of the gap has shown different results ranging from 800 to1,100 MW of new, operable generation capacity in order to meet peak load and to maintain a 25% reserve margin (World Bank, 2011)5. Substantial export capacities will remain. 75% of the capacity of the new Yerevan CCGT and of unit 5 at Hrazdan TPP, as well as full capacity of the Meghri HPP (to be operational in 2019) are dedicated to electricity export.The Figure 5.

Comparison of Energy Consumption per Capita and Energy Intensity by Countries 10 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Armenia\u2019s first National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) was developed in 2010 when there was no detailed energy balance in the country and the latest bottom-up data collection was conducted in 2005 for the development of the National Program on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy, adopted in 2007. The lack of statistical data limited the possibility of assessing the energy saving potential adequately, as well as quantifying the indicative energy saving targets. 1.3 Setting the Target As a best-practice strategy for NEEAPs, the baseline is selected based on the average of the three consecutive years for which adequate statistics were available. Given the availability of detailed energy balance for 2010-2012 in Armenia, the present NEEAP uses the average of these three years to set the baseline. This NEEAP also uses the energy intensity of GDP, sectoral energy intensities, as well as primary or final energy use per capita. Similarly, the targets set by the Government for national programs and strategies aimed at energy efficiency usually use primary or final energy sources used by a target year. The NEEAP is no exception. Energy efficiency targets for the NEEAPs can be set based on: \u203a primary or final energy consumption; \u203a primary or final energy savings; \u203a energy intensity. Considering that the energy system losses are estimated by various studies at approximately 30%, and that the second NEEAP also focuses on supply-side energy efficiency measures, which will also deliver substantial primary energy saving. A TPES target will be better for Armenia\u2019s economy with consideration of the resource efficiency, economic competitiveness and energy security considerations. As recommended by the European best practices, and for the ease of use and monitoring, Armenia\u2019s second NEEAP also expresses those targets in terms of an absolute level of primary energy consumption and final energy consumption in 2020 and shall explain how, and on the basis of which data, this must be calculated. The comparison of total primary energy consumption in the CIS countries\u2014among them Armenia and Georgia acting as observers to the EnC Treaty and Ukraine and Moldova acting as contracting parties\u2014 shows that TPES consumption in Armenia is the second lowest in the region (See). As noted above, this does not necessarily act as an indicator of efficiency, but rather shows a lack of technological advancement and economic development, as well as heavy reliance on service sectors. These factors allowed Armenia\u2019s GDP to grow faster than its energy consumption. 11 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT The below table presents the total primary energy sources and final energy consumption for the three latest years for which adequate statistics was available and their average as the baseline for the second NEEAP energy saving target.

Since Armenia is not expected to contribute to any absolute target, cost-effectiveness and alignment with national economic development objectives are the applicable decision criteria, and the size of the target is based on the remaining cost-effective energy savings potential and its ability to pay for the necessary investments, i.e., their current GDP and its future changes. Hence, Armenia\u2019s target is decoupled from any absolute quantitative target and a linkage is proposed to the enforcement and effectiveness of national policies, energy efficiency financing, promotion of energy services and the provision of information. Such a target is tied to quality of growth, reducing the energy content of the output without geopardizing the economic development of the country. As the graph below indicates, Armenia has already made some progress in this direction in the past decade. 6 Bertoldi, P., EU 2020 and 2030 Energy Saving Targets and the role of National Energy Efficiency Actions Plans, Presentation, ACEEE, 2014 12 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Figure 9.

Thus, the country is heavily dependent on energy imports, which has placed an increasing burden on the current account. In 2012 energy imports amounted to 90% of the total of 3.377 Mtoe primary energy supplied. The share of energy imports in TPES fluctuates slightly depending on the hydro potential. In dry years, imports increase. Although reduced during the recent years, overall energy losses are still high. About 30% of the total primary energy supplied was lost through transformation, transmission and distribution (USAID, 2014). This underlines the importance of energy infrastructure improvement and EE development. This is the reason why the IFI support requested by the Armenian Government in the energy sector also largely focuses on loss reduction, reliability and increased effectiveness of the distribution networks. All EE measures that are provided by this program are measures for reduction of energy consumption among end users. The same applies and for EE measures which are taken in the power plants that generate electricity and thermal energy. It is necessary to emphasize that the implementation of measures at the site of energy end users is considerably more conducive to reducing the consumption of primary energy, compared to power plants that generate energy. The reason for this lies in the fact that the generation of energy, except losses during transformation of primary into secondary form of energy, appear and additional losses of transmission and distribution. 2.1 Reducing high-voltage network losses and Enhancing reliability of Power Supply in Armenia Optimal approach is to predict the energy efficiency measures in all steps \u2013 at the side of power supply (production of transformed form of energy, transport, distribution) and at the side of the energy end users.

The planned projects which target loss reduction and efficiency in distribution networks include the following: 1. \"EBRD -Armenia Power Supply Rehabilitation Project: Phase 1. Rehabilitation of 220 kV transmission network and substations in Armenia (EUR 65,000,000), of which : 2. \"WB Electricity Supply Reliability Project. Rehabilitate key substation and transmission lines critical for system-wide reliability of power supply (US$ 41,550,000 for now) or US$ 66, 600,000) reducing system losses from 2.2-2.7 % to 0.7% reaching positive net economic benefit in 2030. 2.2 Reducing low-voltage electric network losses In addition to the high-voltage network losses and reliability issues, losses remain higher than allowed by the regulator in the low-voltage networks operated by the Armenian Electric Networks.

Hence, the second NEEAP must include measures for the reduction of the losses in the low-voltage networks. Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT In addition to the above, the lossess in the low-voltage network of the Armenian Electric Networks (ArmElNet) have persistently been beyond the regulated permissible level. See below table for details. The losses visualized in Figure 11 are quantified along with the energy saving potential below in Table 8. Table 8.

In order to 24 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT facilitate investments in EE and RE solutions, and increase the use of clean, efficient, safe and affordable heating technologies the Government of Armenia has joined the donor community to create replicable technical and financial models for enhanced access to renewable energy use. The 2011 Renewable Energy Roadmap identified the RE technical-economic potential (e.g. almost 4 Terawatt- hours of solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity per year, and over 4 TWh in geothermal heat pumps). In 2013 the President of Armenia approved the National Energy Security Concept. In 2014 the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program Investment Plan set targets for renewable energy development until 2025. The survey of Armenian RE equipment vendors conducted in June 2015 revealed that there is a notable growth trend in implementation of RE practices in many different sectors of the economy. The graph below illustrates the cumulative areas and capacity of installed solar panels by the local companies during last five years derived from the survey. While the trend is positive, the installed capacities are still less than 0,2% of the solar PV target set for 2020. The level of utilization of solar PV electricity can be promoted through possibilities of grid-connection and definition of parralel operation through net metering. 2.3.1 Enforcing Net Metering for Independent Solar Electricity Producers ( 50 15 30 20 25 150 200 100 250 as ) 2 m a e r A #REF! #REF! also ) h W k ( known y t i c a p a C facilitated Net metering policies have the expansion of renewable energy through on-site generation, distributed generation. Common distributed generation sources, which can be located at a house, school or business rather than utility-owned property, are solar panels, micro-turbines or other renewable energy sources. Increasing numbers of utility customers are using net metering to generate electricity from sources on their property. Net Metering provides PV customers with opportunity to have a zero charge against their electricity consumption if it is offset by the PV generation; in case they produce and export to the grid more energy than they consume, they will receive the relevant remuneration or, alternatively, will be charged for the excess consumption, if it exceeds the level of PV generation. The 2003 Law on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy created the legal provision for net metering. In 2005 the PSRC developed the procedures for parallel operation of autonomous renewable energy producers, which defined the non- commercial relationship of the electric network with the micro-generation facilities with capacity under 150 kW (PSRC Resolution \u2116194, 30.11.2005). The regulation, however, has failed to be implemented Figure 12. Solar PV Installations, 2011-2015 0 years 10 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 25 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT due to tax accounting issues, which require immediate solution. With the growing energy tariffs, the small-scale solare PVs systems hold a large potential to help develop the distributed RE generation. 2.3.2 Greater Use of Solar Thermal Energy The solar water heaters\u2019 market has been evolving rapidly. A vendor survey conducted specifically for purposes of second NEEAP preparation revealed a trend much faster than expected (See Figure 13). Figure 13.

If the growth trend continues, which is highly probable given the increased availability of loans and leasing schemes for SWHs, Armenia may accoplish more than the targets set for 2020 for SWH installed capacity and energy output (at current rate, by 2020 there will be 15 MW installed capacity, which is more than the SREP target by 5MW, similarly the energy output will be 25GWh per year instead of the 13 GWh / year set in the SREP Investment Plan.).8 2.3.3 Piloting Geothermal Heat Pumps for Scalable Centralized Heating Solutions Another EE-integrated renewable energy solution for Armenia is geothermal heat pumps, which have been estimated to have significant potential for space heating. The Renewable Energy Roadmap of 8Scaling up Renewable Energy Program (SREP) Investment Plan, 2014. 26 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Armenia has estimated maximum 75MW capacity for geothermal energy, which can be event more if utilized for supply hot water and heating to nearby locations.Unlike other countires, there is no applied experience of geothermal heat pumps\u2019 in Armenia. Development and piloting of geothermal district heating system for the resort town of Jermuk for supply to municipal, residential and commercial buildings (sanatoriums/spas), utilizing the water from local high-temperature mineral springs. Jermuk has a long heating season and high tourism traffic which creates need to supply high qualiity heating and hot water services to the multiple hotels and resort facilities. Should the system be found efficient in Jermuk, there is replication potential in other towns of Armenia. Such investments have to be estimated for each particular site and terrain (variable borehole drilling cost), however, under Armenia\u2019s general circumstances a pilot project for a typial building 5-floor building is necessary to verify the cost-effectiveness and economic viability of this technology for heating residential and public buildings. It is key to seek a public-private partnership arrangements whereby a private energy service provider can partner with the local Government (Jermuk municipality, in this case) for utilization of municipal assets and private management, investment co-financing and know-how. At the same time, geothermal heat pumps for heating can reduce the demand for imported gas for heating purposes and associated greenhouse gas emissions, utilize indigenous clean and sustainable energy resource. The assessment of the primary energy saving measures are presented in the section on Industry, Power and SMEs. 27 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT 3 FINAL ENERGY SAVINGS IN THE END USE SECTORS 3.1 Review of final energy saving targets and final energy saving achievements As Figure 14 indicates, Armenia\u2019s final energy consumption largely takes place in the buildings (residential, public and commercial) and the transport sectors. What is noteworthy, both sectors make only small insignificant contributions to GDP. Industry used only 18% of the energy, while selivering about 33% of the GDP. Commercial and public services accounted for about 16% and agriculture - for about 7%. The share of the residential sector fluctuates depending on weather conditions. Agriculture & Forestry 7% Industr y 18% Public & Commercial Services 16% As the below figure indicates, the commercial, and the public service sector is the only one which showed steady increase of energy consumption over the last years. With the projected economic trends, the industrial energy use and buildings are expected to grow substantially and lead to a significant hike in the final energy consumption. The dinamics and forecast of final energy consumption is presented in Residen tial 34% Transport 25% Figure 14.

Final Energy Use Trend and Projections by Sector9 3.1.1 National overall end-use energy savings targets and progress towards them 3.1.1.1. Achievement of the 2014 intermediate energy end-use target The 2010 energy balance was prepared shortly after the completion of the first NEEAP. The indicative target for the end of the first NEEAP was thus later quantified by the team developing the second NEEAP using the energy balance data for 2010.10 Since the second NEEAP was prepared in 2015, the first period was assumed to cover 2011-2014. The energy saving target for the first period of the first NEEAP was baseline energy consumption of 2010 (1900.6 ktoe). The second NEEAP sets an interim target of 3.3%, equivalent to 63.3 ktoe. The assessment of the first NEEAP revealed that this target has been outperformed: The overall energy saving reached by 2014 was 6.3% (120.3 ktoe). The second NEEAP continues the relevant measures from the first NEEAP, and in addition proposes an updated bundle of measures and energy saving targets for the second period, covering 2015-2017. The second NEEAP tracks both the indicative milestone year 2018, as well as a long-term plan until 2020. The document was prepared based on the template recommended by the Energy Community, in which the Republic of Armenia has had observer status since 01.10.2011. In accordance with the NEEAP methodology, the baseline used in the second NEEAP is the average energy consumption from three consecutive years (2010, 2011 and 2012), in this case 2,047 ktoe. Based on the assessed progress under the first NEEAP and the expected impact of the ongoing and new energy efficiency improvement measures, the second NEEAP proposes a new set of targets for 2017 (9.9% instead of the 10.4% proposed in the first NEEAP), 9Source: USAID, 2012. Reference scenario for 2015-2030. 10 EC-LEDS Program In Armenia. 29 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT for 2018 (11.2% instead of 13.8%), and a higher overall target for 2020 (34.2% instead of 22.3%). Table 9.

For this reason, the reduced targets of the second NEEAP may be outperformed when energy efficiency financing is quantified in the third NEEAP. 3.1.1.2. Expected savings in relation to the 2018 overall energy end-use target New measures are introduced in all sectors second NEEAP. These measures primarily relate to enforcing new regulations, into public procurement, encouraging improved energy performance of industrial and SME energy consumers, promoting end-use distributed generation of electricity and thermal energy by energy end\u2014 integrating energy efficiency 30 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT users, as well a introducing a comprehensive monitoring and planning approach for the transport sector.

Envisaged measures are closely related to strategic documents, action plans and promotional measures for greater use of renewable energy. The national intermediate indicative targets for 2017 and onward was calculated on the basis of the average final consumption of energy during the realization of first NEEAP. Table 11. National indicative targets Indicative target in 2017 (ktoe) Realized savings in 2014 (ktoe) Sector Horizontal Residential Public sector Industry Transport Agriculture Total: 10% 6% Sector target 2017 (ktoe) 40.6 31.3 4.9 34.6 90.4 1.7 % 4.17% 1.84% 9.55% 17.67% 1.13% 9.94% 80.06 100.00% A significant number of strategic documents and regulations have been adopted in the Republic of Armenia. Those documents contain various activities related to the implementation of EE measures. The impact of these individual actions can hardly be separated and difficult to 31 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT evaluate due to their combined nature and overlapping results. For this reason, when there are no defined standards and methods for this purpose, the effect of these measures cannot be accurately assessed. The climate change mitigation potential of the second NEEAP measures has been assessed ad is presented below in Table 12. Table 12. Tons of CO2 emission avoided by target year based on Sectoral Measures Sectors Tons of CO2 emission avoided by target year Horizontal and CC Buildings (Residential) Public Buildings and Services Industry Transport Agriculture Total GHG Avoided (tons CO2) 2014 183,156.88 1,366.26 186.32 158.36 31.37 - 183,532.93 2017 209,514.79 28,860.00 25,493.02 270.13 40.15 7,636.80 271,814.88 2018 222,693.74 28,860.00 27,292.80 1,211.54 42.93 15,318.00 295,419.02 2020 249,051.65 28,860.00 31,249.79 2,261.54 48.63 22,954.80 334,426.40 A combination of top-down and bottom-up methodologies was used. For the implementation of the proposed set of energy efficiency measures, it was necessary to strengthen the institutional support, especially in buildings. Adoption of the new Housing Legislation \u2013 stipulating that every multi apartment facility must operate as a legal entity \u2013 to form a community of tenants of the building or delegate the housing maintenance function to a professional organization, is a big step forward in the legislation, which, combined with the enforcement of the amended Law on ES & RE and the secondary legislation, should enable faster renovation of these buildings. Establishment of Home-Owners association will ensure higher quality of housing maintenance and potentially - implementation of thermal modernization of buildings. This process is envisioned with the establishment of private maintenance companies and development of ESCO services, too. Monitoring of the implementation of the second NEEAP and reporting results based on measuring and verification of energy savings are under responsibility of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. In order to monitor the actual energy savings and to avoid problems related to the lack of data needed to calculate the savings from individual measures, which was present in the preparation of this NEEAP, the MoENR must establish an information system to track all activities of energy efficiency and energy savings assessment. Tasks can be assigned (outsourced) to expert teams outside MoENR, if necessary. Realistic and stable funding sources for the implementation of the second NEEAP have to be provided in most of the extra-budgetary sources of financing and market mechanisms. The second NEEAP 32 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT includes measures which still do not have committed funding. A very small part of budgetary resources (Central and Local) have to be allocated, for the drafting of the policies, development of tariff reform, preparation of the programs within the specific measures, however significant funds will be necessary for the implementation of the energy efficiency investments will remain under the funding of the donors and IFIs. 3.1.2 National targets for nearly zero energy buildings Armenia has not formally established a national target for nearlyzeroenergy buildings \u2013 buildings with energy consumption close to zero. Nevertheless, several steps have been taken to support buildings beyond the current codes\u2019 requirements. These initiatives are aimed at a broader of green architecture, sustainable communities, smart cities and green economy. These initiatives particularly include the following: \uf0b7 Drafting of the Law on Yerevan City Center, with beyond codes ambition for energy performance in new construction if it is to happen in the Center of Armenia\u2019s capital; \uf0b7 Drafting of Law on Green City of Dilijan, Tavush Marz \uf0b7 Developing a dialogue and concept for smart cities in Armenia with the example of Goris, Vayots Dzor Marz. \uf0b7 Avedisian School and Community Center in Yerevan\u2019s Malatia-Sebastia district was constructed as a \u201cgreen\u201d building and was certified for Leadership in Energy and low-carbon Environmental Design (LEED), utilizes renewable energy and footprint.UNDP estimated that energy consumption in the building will be reduced by 30 percent, which is even a stricter criteria than required in the EU and the US. The green roof of the school will provide insulation, lowering heating and cooling costs. Rainwater will be filtered and stored to water plants, shrubs, and provide water for the grass on the soccer field. is \uf0b7 UWC Dilijan College built in Tavush Marz was built and certified as good by the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM)11. The building has a green roof, green walls and holistic building management system (BMS), meets high standards for health, environment, life security, water, materials, recycling, ecology, land-utilization and pollution as well as based on the impact of its use on the environment. 11See more at: arka.am/en/news/economy/uwc_dilijan_college_first_breeam_certified_in_armenia/#sthash.e7FLUxc4.dpuf 33 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT \uf0b7 Educational curriculum and courses were developed and delivered on integrated building design and energy efficient construction, supported by UNDP/GEF and ITS. While having no international obligation for transposing any directives or international standards for nearly zero, green or passive buildings, Armenian Government and business community voluntarily endeavors tosupport the construction of new nearly zero energy buildings and the achievement of thislevel of energy performance in the refurbishment of existing buildings. for Basictasksforthisperiodincludeeducation ofdesignersas well as providingtraining developers, architects and contractors. Thistaskwill be carried outin parallelwiththe determinationof criteria for priorityareas for implementation, constructionofpilotsites andthe definitionofmomentumfor the implementationofthesemeasures to complywith thefinancial resources. Due to the voluntary nature of this process, it can only be promoted through certification, recognition and publicity of such accomplishments, which through professional associations and academia can set the tradition and culture for nearly zero energy performance in construction. 3.2 Horizontal Measures The first NEEAP set forth a set of horizontal measures in seven key areas, largely directed at the legal-regulatory framework, capacity building and financing for energy efficiency. Considering the horizontal nature of these measures, their quantitative assessment is presented among the respective sectoral measures. Table 13.

The National Statistical Service, Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and INOGATe Technical Secretariat have signed a memorundum on \"Cooperation in the field of statistics\" including an action plan related to sctions necessary the energy balance. However, no regular procedure for routine preparation of energy balances for following years was put in place. The National Agency was not established, instead the R2E2 has been tasked with many of the functions that traditionally national agencies perform. Over $86 million has been committed to energy efficiency and EE-integrated renewable energy investment during 2010-2014 via various donors and IFIs, such as WB, IFC, GEF, EBRD, IFC, GGF, EIB, KfW, and UNDP. In addition, these donor and IFI funds have had a market transformation impact on the financial services sector. According to Econoler experts' estimations, the local financial institutions and universal credit organizations have also tapped into this market and financed EE & RE investments from own resources in addition to on-lending portfolio with the IFIs. By expert assessment, over $420 million has been invested by LFIs and UCOs in diverse loans, with average equity financing of 17.5% which leverages approximately $89 million in equity participation. Overall, it can be concluded that approximately $595 million has been invested in energy efficiency and EE- integrated RE solutions during 2010-2014.

The task also is in synergy with Armenia's committments under the UNFCCC 3.2.1 Financial Support for Energy Efficiency in All Sectors As discussed with the stakeholders, the second NEEAP devotes more attention to the investment framework than the first NEEAP. The purpose of this focus is to analyze the availability, nature and direction in which investment finance is available for energy efficiency improevement measures. This analysis then allows to identify the gaps where investments are not supplied by the banks, donors and IFIs, and invite decision-makers\u2019 attention to this issue and recommend interventions. The figure below provides an at-a-glance overview of the major donor and IFI funding directions in the field of energy efficiency, followed by an analysis of the various investment flows, supplied lending as well as the unmet demand for investment finance. 45 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Figure 16. Overview of the major donor and IFI funding directions in the field of energy efficiency Renovation and new construction in the public sector is largely financed by the World Bank (through different PIUs and R2E2 Fund), including social investments, major infrastructure projects in irrigation, construction and for public/social/municipal sectors. In addition, during the middle of 2014 KfW has been discussing the possibility of a concessional loan for energy efficiency renovation of schools with Ministry of Finance and MUD, potentially with participation from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). reconstruction of public buildings, as well as energy efficiency The European Commission has recently been supporting the municipal energy efficinecy initiatives within the scope of the Covenant of Mayors and the Sustainable Energy Action Plans by Armenian signatory cities. Other FIs (EBRD, AFD, IFC, GGF, KfW) are implementing or planning credit facilities for the residential sector, predominantly through participating banks / credit institutions and offering energy efficiency loans 46 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT for household energy efficiency retrofits, however none of them offer residential EE financing for building-level solutions. As part of these IFI-funded credit lines numerous commercial banks have access to credit specifically for energy efficiency activity: \u203a In 2012 the GoA approved EE project under the WB financing implemented by R2E2 fund. The project is targeted to implement energy saving activities in public facilities to reduce the level of energy consumption by social and other public facilities. The cost of the project estimated to be about 10.7 mln USD. \u203a The R2E2 Fund is involved in BSBEEP-Black See Buildings Energy Efficiency Plan Project (2013- 2015) within EU funded Black See Joint Operation Programme with the overall objective of strengthening the administrative capacity of local authorities and exchange good practice knowledge in energy efficiency in buildings.12 \u203a UNDP/GEF is implementing a project aimed at Improving Energy Efficiency in Buildings including massive support to the Armenian Government in transposition of EPBD, development of secondary legislation for EE in buildings, as well as funding the first pilot thermal modernization of a residential multi-apartment building in Avan district of Yerevan, as well as social housing in Goris and Akhouryan towns. \u203a United Nations Development Program (UNDP) / Global Environment Facility (GEF): Green Urban Lighting: This is a grant-funded project aiming at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by increasing energy efficiency of municipal lighting in the cities of Armenia via implementation of municipal investment programs and national policies. The project is in compliance with the national priorities to strengthen the economic and energy independence of the Republic of Armenia by promoting resources efficient and climate resilient growth.

On the other hand, has been working with MUD to assess the market for residential energy efficiency lending which would target the energy saving potential in existing residential buildings. \u203a Habitat for Humanity Armenia has worked with Inecobank on residential energy efficiency upgrades serving a total of 99 families in 3 buildings, with a total disbursement of roughly USD$ 6,000 per building and is the only entity that has succeeded in extending a bank-based commercial loan to a condominium in Armenia to 6 condominiums, more pending within their ongoing USAID- funded Residential Energy Efficiency for Low-Income Households (REELIH) program, as well as the SUDEP Project financed by European Commission for EE and RE projects in Spitak and Vayq communities, as signatories of the Covenant of Mayors. \u203a Ameria Bank also has household and SME EE Loan product supported with own financial resources \u203a Membership in the Eastern Europe EE and Environment Partnership (E5P) will enable implementing very important EE projects. The investment from Armenia will amount to about \u20ac1 million to be paid in portions and in addition to which Armenia will be granted nearly \u20ac20 million. Armenia did not yet pay the first portion of the membership fee to commence the projects. On 8 April 2014 the MoE has received a letter from EBRD informing that three countries (Czech Republic, Poland and Sweden) have already contributed to Armenian window in total \u20ac1.84 mln. The Government of Armenia signed the Contribution Agreement with EBRD, the Fund manager, on 16 March 2015 and will make its first installment in accordance with the timeline specified in the contribution agreement. \u203a KfW and the Republic of Armenia have signed the Inter-Governmental Agreement on three new loans aimed at: - EE integrated reinforcement of Schools - EE credit line for SME ; and - Housing EE credit line \u203a Also gradually evolving are the European Covenant of Mayors efforts in Armenia, with now 10 signatories, of which 3 cities already have their Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs), the 14 Armenian Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (ArmSEFF),  Is Energocredit and Armenia Sustainable Energy Financing Facility the same??? 48 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT remaining 7 are scheduled to have their SEAPs by the end of 2015, however lack substantially capacity to make progress in this direction on their own. \u203a EU-funded INOGATE programme15 - Armenia participated in the EU-funded INOGATE programme, which provided the country with technical assistance concerning electricity and gas standards and tariffs, as well as the development of sustainable energy sources.16.

EE / RE PORTFOLIO FOR 2010 - 2020, USD The analysis of the energy efficiency and sustainable energy investment market, including the IFI reporting indicators has identified recent trends in EE investment field in the Republic of Armenia, revealed the capacity of the market to support planned investments in energy efficiency development until 2020 on annual basis, as well as assessed the uncovered need for investments in energy efficiency to sustain the fastest rate of achievement against energy saving targets. There are two main sources to finance EE projects : a) Local Financial Institutions: Banks and Universal Credit Organizations Total loan portfolio of local financial institutions (LFIs), which includes banks and universal credit organizations (UCOs) increased from $3.026 bln in 2010 to $4.625 bln17in 2015, i.e. 8,88% per year. This is about twice more than the GDP growth of Armenia for the same period (recorded at less than 4.65%18). The assessed portfolio largest in 2015. Local currency loan portfolio increased 1.59 times, 17 Information Source:  18 Information source: IMF World Economic Outlook, 2014 50 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT and foreign currency loan portfolio increased 2.27 times in the same period. The main conclusion is that LFIs prefer loans in foreign currency as a currency risk mitigation tactic. The total loan portfolio grew from 34% of GDP in 2010 up to 42% of GDP in 2015. Thus, the total loan portfolio has at least twice growth potential, up to 80-100% of GDPlevel.19 The average loan maturity for loans provided by banks for 2010-2015 registering a slight decline for both local and foreign currency loans.20 The total amount of loans provided in both local and foreign currency has increased at the same time (see table and figure below). Two major factors impacting this trend were the lack of long term funds and currency risk. Table 15. Main indicators of Banks loan portfolio for 2010-2015 1 loans provided in local currency 1.1 Average maturity 4.29 (4.38 years in 2010 and 4.17 in 2015) 1.2 Growth of total amount 11% (from AMD9.23bln to AMD10.24bln) 2 loans provided in foreign currency 2.1 Average maturity 4.47 (4.54 in 2010 and 4.12 in 2015) 2.2 Growth of total amount 83% (from AMD12.44 bln to AMD22.74 bln) 19 Cumulative LFI loan portfolio amount of most of developing countries with 4-7% GDP yearly growth is comparable with GDP 20 Information source: dates provided by Banks 51 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT , 0 3 8 6 9 7 1 3 , , 1 6 5 8 8 7 1 2 , , 0 3 7 3 8 9 2 3 , , 9 0 4 8 3 7 2 2 , , 9 6 2 8 0 0 0 1 , , 1 2 3 5 4 2 0 1 , , 9 7 1 2 2 0 6 2 , , 6 9 2 2 1 2 6 1 , , 2 8 8 9 0 8 9 , , 3 5 5 3 9 4 4 2 , , 9 1 4 6 6 5 5 1 , , 4 3 1 7 2 9 8 , , 7 8 2 1 2 5 2 2 , , 9 5 7 0 1 4 3 1 , , 8 2 5 0 1 1 9 , , 2 8 3 7 6 6 1 2 , , 8 5 2 9 3 4 2 1 , 35,000,000 30,000,000 25,000,000 20,000,000 15,000,000 10,000,000 5,000,000 - , 4 2 1 8 2 2 9 , 2010 2011 Local Currency 2012 2013 2014 Foreign Currency 2015 Total Figure 19.

Table 16. Main indicators of UCOs loan portfolio for 2010-2015 1 loans provided in local currency 1.1 Average maturity 2.75 (2.91 years in 2010 and 2.72 in 2015) 1.2 Growth of total amount 99% (from AMD2.77 bln to AMD5.51 bln) 2 loans provided in foreign currency 2.1 Average maturity 3.07 (2.91 in 2010 and 3.19 in 2015) 2.2 Growth of total amount 67% (from AMD1.03 bln to AMD1.72 bln) The total amount of loans provided LFIs in local currency has increased by1.33%, and the total amount of loans provided LFIs in foreign currency has increased by over 40%, it means that growth of landing in local currency is about 13 times less than growth of lending in foreign currency. How could this 21 Information source: dates provided by Union of Credit Organizations of the Republic of Armenia (UCORA) 52 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT happen? There are two strong reasons here: A) it conforms that LFIs has not any effective currency risk mitigation tools, experience and capacity, and in lack of these lending in foreign currency is more attractive for LFIs. B) Most of LFIs preferred turn to lending to foreign currency loans when provided refinancing of local currency loans. The main conclusion is that LFIs pay strong attention to currency risk mitigation, and currency risk is a determining factor for EE investments. The share of EE projects in total loans disbursed by LFIs decreased for loans in both local and foreign currency22 (see table below).The main conclusion is that EE lending become less attractive for LFIs, plus there is a huge share of loan refinancing, which increased in 2010-2015. Table 17. Total loans disbursed by LFIs Indicator 2010 2015 Average share for 2010-2015 Total loans disbursed by local banks Loans in local currency Loans in foreign currency Total loans disbursed by UCOs Loans in local currency Loans in foreign currency 8.60% 8.70% 13.00% 11.40% 5.70% 6.40% 7.40% 8.30% 7.00% 7.30% 10.00% 9.50% We can mark two issues for this period: A). Share of refinancing, including IFI loans, increased in 2010- 2015. LFIs re-qualify loan from \"EE\" to \"ordinary usually in process of refinancing. B) We can see that drop of loans in Local currency about 1.5-1.8 times faster than in foreign currency. It is obvious that trend to turn to foreign currency lending is not attractive for EE project hosts and developers. Amount of EE / RE Loans provided by LFIs, including International Financial Institutions\u2019 (IFI) funds, increased from $68.74 mln in 2010 to $83.78mln in 2015, i.e. 2.71% per year, which is about 1.72 times less than the annual GDP growth rate. So, Armenia had about $340 mln unutilized EE investment potential in 2010-2015. The total amount of funds disbursed in EE loans during 2010-2015 as of mid-2015 was $471.14 mln, of which about 81,88% or $385.78 mln disbursed by banks, the remaining 18.12% - by UCOs. At the same time, the share of EE loans disbursed by UCOs increased from 14.92% to 17.97% reaching the largest share in 2012 at about 22.45%. The trend proves that UCOs become one of key players in EE investment In Armenia, especially in short- and medium-term lending. The lending by LFIs and UCOs is presented in Figure 20. 22 Information source: dates provided by banks and UCORA 53 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT , 5 9 9 8 0 0 2 6 , , 3 9 2 2 5 2 4 6 , , 8 6 8 0 5 9 7 1 , , 7 2 7 2 1 7 4 1 , , 7 9 4 3 8 1 2 7 , , 1 9 6 0 1 7 5 1 , , 5 0 1 6 1 7 8 6 , , 3 5 3 7 5 0 5 1 , , 3 6 4 1 8 4 8 5 , 80,000,000 70,000,000 60,000,000 50,000,000 40,000,000 30,000,000 20,000,000 10,000,000 - , 9 4 9 6 3 1 0 6 , , 3 9 8 4 5 2 0 1 , , 2 4 7 1 7 6 1 1 , 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Local Banks UCOs Figure 20.

The biggest lenders were EBRD with total amount of $49.26 mlnand IFC with total amount of $26.57 mln. These two IFIs covered 86% of total loan disbursement by IFIs: 56% EBRD and 30% IFC. Shares of other IFIs were very small, except GGF-about 8% of total amount disbursed. Average weighted interest rate was 10.72%, loan maturity more than 78 months.

The most acceptable collaterals were company fixed and current assets, including production facilities, transport and raw materials, own facilities and funds of company shareholders, as well as guaranties from other/third entities. The biggest portion of EE loans in 2010-2015 were provided to Industry, more than 35%, about 22% to power sector/generation and 18% to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), with transport sector being blended with industry and SMEs as well.

About 150 thousand TOE was saved in 2010-2015, and more than 18.30 mln TOE would be saved in 2016-2020, due to the cumulative effect of savings from past investments. GGF is going to be e main 56 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT player in this activity with its estimated share in total savings expected to be about 97.2%. This may potentially be due to the fact, that majority of IFIs has failed to provide reasonable forecast of lending plans beyond 2015. Capacity Building for Financial Institutions and Supporting the Market for Energy Services Considering the unserved gap in the energy efficinecy financing demand and the liquidity of the local financial institutions, a comprehensive effort is necessary aimed at building the capacity of the LFIs in the following three directions: Legislation and regulations a) EE Invest/lending climate and banking regulation improvement event (ILCIE) The overall objective of this task is to improve investment policy, banking regulations and normative to make SE financing/lending more feasible for LFIs, IFIs and investors, and attract investments to the sustainable energy sector of Armenia, as well as to promote cooperation among Financial sector, regulatory and policy makers and interested bodies in Armenia through creation of a list of recommendations to submit to Government. b) Introduction of a compulsory energy audit (label) system for industry Specific objectives of the combined event are: to create a roadmap forintroduction of a compulsory energy audit (label) system for industry to formulate the compulsory energy audit procedures, terms and conditions for big energy consumers to formulate the compulsory energy audit procedures, terms and conditions for SMEs c) Improving university curricula in the areas of energy efficiency The overall objective of this task is to teach new skills in EE to students Armenian technical universities through improving the EE curricula of the beneficiary universities by developing and giving new lectures on following EE subjects: a) EE policy, b) EE economic analysis, c) EE technologies in energy & industrial sector and d) EE tech. in design, const. & operation of buildings.

Expected results will be: a) improved professional skills to design and conduct effective information campaigns and awareness raising activities to promote SE among a broad range of groups; b) increased awareness of these professionals on the need, importance, and benefits of adequate awareness raising efforts; c) enhanced networking among peers in EE 3.2.2 Promotion of the Covenant of Mayors A process which has initiated after the first NEEAP development was the Covenant of Mayors East Movement. It is a horizontal measure with regards to the cross-sectoral nature, local policy and planning elements, as well as emerging synergies with the national and international policies and progams, as well as financial measures. Implementation of CoM in Armenia is facilitated by respective supporting structures including the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of RA, acting as the Covenant Coordinator in Armenia, as well as by Union of Communities of Armenia and Energy Saving Foundation, acting as the Covenant Supporters in Armenia. Coordinators are defined as those entities that are in a position to provide strategic guidance, technical and financial support to municipalities with the political will to sign up to the Covenant of Mayors, but lacking the skills and /or resources to fulfill its requirements, namely the preparation and implementation of Sustainable Energy Action Plan. Supporters are national, regional and local networks and associations of local and regional authorities which leverage their 59 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT lobbying, communication and networking activities to promote the Covenant of Mayors initiative and support the commitments of their signatories. As of 01.07.2015 there are 10 signatories of the Covenant of mayors in Armenia. List of signatories with completed SEAPs and SEAPs under development is presented in the table below. Table 18.

For Tsaghkadzor this value considerably differs not only because of very small size of the community but also because consideration of transport streams (including intercity traffic through the territory of the community) in the Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI) of that signatory. For other communities that component of BEI is usually not considered because influence of the local authorities on that sector is very limited. As of 01.07.2015 there are four SEAPs approved by the municipal councils of the signatories and two plans for Aparan and Artik are under development. For estimation of ecological efficiency of the proposed energy saving and GHG emission reduction measures a concept of sectorial capital intensity (i.e. investments needed to reach one tone of CO2 emission reduction 60 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT per year) of measures is applied. Sectorial capital intensity of measures proposed in SEAPs are represented in the below table. Table 19.

Average value can be estimates at about 800 Euro / tCO2 year. The biggest investments are needed for budgetary and RE sectors. Most effective investments seem to be in residential sector. The capital intensity value for this sector is quite close to the total value which is explained by big weight of this sector in overall balance of GHG emission reduction sometimes reaching up to 80% (e.g. for Spitak). Key measures proposed for implementation in residential and public buildings are as follows: \uf0fc Thermal insulation of building envelopes; \uf0fc Replacement of roof coats with galvanized iron plates or new coating materials; \uf0fc Application of thermal insulation materials (15-20 cm thickness) on ceilings of last floors of the buildings with balks; \uf0fc Replacement of wooden windows with new energy efficient ones; \uf0fc Replacement of entrance doors of multi apartment buildings; \uf0fc Replacement of inefficient incandescent lamps with energy efficient lighting, etc. Also the following so-called low-cost measured aimed to save heat in premises are envisaged in the buildings: \uf0fc Insulation of windows and doors with application of silicone, foam rubber, sealants, polyvinylchloride and foam plastic; \uf0fc Installation of door closers; \uf0fc Installation of heat reflecting screens behind radiators; \uf0fc Construction of tambours; \uf0fc Heat insulation of internal heat distribution networks in basements and attics, etc. Key measures proposed in transport sector are introduced below: \uf0fc Introduction of bikeways; \uf0fc Shift to natural gas as a fuel for municipal and public transport. 61 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT In the renewable energy sector the following measures are proposed: \uf0fc Installation of individual (apartment level) solar water heaters; \uf0fc Installation of solar water heaters for collective use for hot water supply and pools; \uf0fc Installation of PV modules for electricity generation for illumination of entrances and yards of multi apartment buildings. Utilization of other types of RE sources on the territories of the target municipalities is not promising and, hence, is not considered in the SEAPs. From energy and ecological efficiency standpoints renewable energy is relatively \u201cexpensive\u201d option (see table 2). Measures proposed for awareness raising of population and enterprises are summarized below: \uf0fc Organizationof \u201cEarthHours\u201d \uf0fc Organization of Energy Days; \uf0fc Application of energy certificates for buildings; \uf0fc Involvement of pupils of schools into energy development of municipalities \uf0fc Introduction of optional subjects on energy saving and renewable energy in schools, etc. Energy efficiency of proposed measures In the table 3 below energy efficiencies of the measures proposed in the SEAPs are summarized.

In the considered SEAPs contribution of residential sector in reduction of energy consumption varies from 34% to 83%. The longer the heating season is the more efficient 62 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT investments in heat insulation of buildings are. From that point of view Aparan is in better position because of 212 day long heating season. Residential sector has the largest potential for energy efficiency because the vast majority of infrastructure is old and has low thermal insulation capacities. However, for identification of optimal and economically justified level of heat proofing features of the infrastructure it is required to carry out a separate and more detailed study with consideration of the existing and perspective heat insulation materials market. In the transport sector shift from petrol to natural gas for passenger cars is definitely justified from economic and ecological points of view. However, GHG emission reduction effect of this measure is limited because difference between emission coefficient of petrol (0,249 t\u0421\u041e2/MWh) and that of natural gas (0,202 t\u0421\u041e2/MWh) are quite close (taking into consideration energy values of both fuels). Nevertheless, transition from petrol to natural gas in the privet transport sector is ongoing intensively and has positive influence. In renewable energy sector only solar energy plays a vital role in the provided SEAPs. Contribution of this source of renewable energy in increase of power consumption efficiency varies from 55 to 25%. Capital intensity of measures with utilization of solar energy is quite stable (1800 \u2013 2200 Euro/tCO2 year). Table 21.

As a result some part of measures described in SEAPs have already been implemented within the period from the selected baseline years to the years of SEAP development. Hence, it makes sense to consider also that period of time (i.e. before 2015). For Tsaghkador, Vayk and Spitak 63 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT implementation of measures starts from 2012, whereas for Hrazdan, Aparan and Artik from 2013. Realization of the majority of proposed measures require more than on-year period. Given that at this stage there are no exact time and work schedules for realization of the measures, annual distribution (breakdown) of investments needed for realization of the proposed measures is made evenly. Dynamics of annual investments for already realized and planned SEAP activities are represented in theTable 22. Information in the table is given for respective sector for 5 municipalities up to 2020. It is likely that this number will grow, but no data is available to assess the dynamics. The consecutive NEEAP(s) will need to assess this impact. For purely analytic purposes, the full range of various financing programs is summarized in the Table 22 to show the overall impact of various donor and IFI efforts and the full scope of the EE financing measures in a single table. The EE financing programs from the below table without cross-cutting/horizontal impact are evaluated as part of their respective sectoral EE improvement measures. 64 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Table 22.

The overall energy efficiency policy reform, regulatory processes and developments are reported in the cross-cutting/horizontal elements, the investments in existing residential buildings and regulations for new construction are covered in the Residential Buildings section (titled \u201dBuildings\u201d). The public buildings, grouped with services sector, are presented in Public and Private Services. Of overall 80 million km2 of the nation-wide building stock, 83% are residential buildings, and the remaining 17% - public buildings. Both the residential and public building stocks are projected to grow, but the residential sector is going to be responsible for most of this growth (Figure 23). 900 800 700 600 500 400 2 M D N S A S U O H T D E D D A public residential 300 200 100 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 3 0 0 2 4 0 0 2 5 0 0 2 6 0 0 2 7 0 0 2 8 0 0 2 9 0 0 2 0 1 0 2 1 1 0 2 2 1 0 2 3 1 0 2 4 1 0 2 5 1 0 2 6 1 0 2 7 1 0 2 8 1 0 2 9 1 0 2 0 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 3 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 5 2 0 2 Figure 23.

There is a vivid adverse correlation between the growing energy prices and the residential energy end use. Hence, it can be presumed that the shrinking energy demand is likely a consequence of 70 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT deteriorating energy affordability (See Figure 25). e o t k 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 - 132 132 132 156 156 156 27.08 27.08 27.08 35.08 38.93 45.86 years D M A 200 160 120 80 40 - 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015* Residential Natural Gas Consumption (ktoe) Other Energy Sources (ktoe) Average Electricity Tariff for Population (AMD/kWh) Residential Electricty Consumption (ktoe) Natural Gas Tariff - Retail (AMD/m3) Figure 25. Energy tariffs and Energy Consumption in Residential Sector, 2010-2015 * - the 2015 tariffs for electricity have been announced by the PSRC, but not effectively enforced due to public protests. The President of RoA announced a temporary freeze on the tariff while an audit investigation assesses the grounds for the proposed tariff hike. In the meantime, the Government will shoulder the difference subsidizing the tariff. The review was not completed by the time of delivery of the present document. * - data on other sources was not available beyond 2013. The 2013 WB Power Sector Tariff Study for Armenia has analyzed the affordability of current and expected energy tariffs under various scenarios. The recent energy price hikes have enhanced energy poverty of low-income households (13% of household disposable income spent on energy costs24). To cover the suppressed demand for electricity and natural gas, the population has increased consumption of wood for heating purposes. Wood consumption throughout the country has increased from 20% of primary energy sources to 30% in 2012. In rural communities this share has reached 62% in 2012. In the absence of the 2011 subsidy for the recipients of the national poverty benefit plan this situation would have been worse. The current tariff structures need to be reviewed and revised to introduce built-in incentives for energy efficiency and conservation, while providing the minimal consumption block to the low- income households at an affordable tariff. The regulatory reform should be supplemented with support for energy efficiency as the best way to sustainably reduce the energy demand in the long run. The next section further analyzes the tariff regulatory framework for electricity and 24 Internationally accepted threshold for energy poverty being 10% of household\u2019s disposable income. 71 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT natural gas. Electricity Tariff Electricity tariffs for the end users are one-part and are defined based on voltage and time zones (time-differentiated tariffs). Difference between tariffs in two time zones may be within about 30%. Hence, electricity tariffs indirectly depend on consumer groups i.e. large consumers that are fed from high voltage substations enjoy lower tariffs then those that are fed from relatively lower voltage distribution system (see Table 23).

This increase will step in as of August 1, 2015, which triggered major social unrest, followed up by a promised by the Government to shoulder the burden of the tariff increase with extra-budgetary sources, while the justifications for tariff increase are being scrutinized through an audit of the utility. To cope with the latest proposed increased of the tariff for the population, in the buildings sector the second NEEAP proposes a low-income efficient lighting program. To remedy the impact of tariff increase, the Government must offer energy efficiency solutions to the low-income households, as opposed to the traditional subsidies. Mitigating impact of electricity tariff increase on low-income households can be done by offering subsidized efficient (LED light bulbs) to replace incandescent light-bulbs in 225,000 households (32% of population categorized as below the poverty line). A respective measure is included in the Financing section. 72 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Gas Tariff Due to the increase of the natural gas import prices electricity tariffs for final customers have been raised several times. Tariffs are also set for the natural gas transmission and distribution companies as well as for the operator of gas supply system and retail supply. One-part tariffs are set for natural gas end users and the tariffs depend on a monthly consumption volume. For different consumers groups the PRSC sets tariffs in different currencies. For large consumers (which consume about 75% of all imported natural gas) the tariff is set in USD to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk for Gazprom-Armenia (the gas importing company).

Natural gas import price and tariffs for two different final customer groups (2003- 2015)* Tariffs for the large customers were 38% lower in 2013 than tariffs set for the smaller consumers (consuming less than 10,000m3 per month). Servicing large consumers indeed creates lower costs. However, such a considerable difference between the tariffs for these two customer groups leads to forced increase of the monthly gas consumption by customers whose monthly consumption is close but still below 10,000 m\u00b3 threshold in order to save money by being billed the wholesale tariff. This happens for building level heating systems and SMEs.25 In order to stop incentivizing waste, and instead incentivizing energy efficiency measures, this perverse tariff incentive must be removed. Certain types of gas consumers must automatically qualify for the wholesale tariff. These include autonomous heating systems, SMEs, small-scale service vendors (cafes, restaurants, hotels, laundries, etc.) and other consumers who on average consume over 7000 m3 per month. In addition, the difference between the wholesale and retail tariffs should be narrowed to eliminate incentive to calibrate consumption to take advantage of the lower tariff, while stopping the cross subsidy of the industrial consumers by the 25 Since many years there has been a discussion about the need to apply the whole-sale tariff for centralized heating systems, but this discussion did not lead to any results. 73 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT population.

A reform is necessary to remove perverse tariff incentives that are accelerating unnecessary gas consumption by public facilities and commercial establishments, SMEs and decentralized small-scale, building-level heating systems. A new tariff structure is necessary to make a transition to an increasing block rate system, which is the internationally recognized best solution for a tariff system, which not only has incentives for conservation, but also a built-in social safety net, allowing the all the lowest income groups (not just the recipients of the poverty benefit plan, which have been paying 100AMD/m3 since 2011 for the first 300m3 as social assistance measure supported by the Government) to receive the minimal level of gas for the lowest possible price, while excessive use is penalized by 74 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT a higher block rate. Technical Regulations for Building Energy Performance The energy efficiency issues of the buildings sector are related with the poor energy performance of the building envelopes in both residential and public buildings, inefficiencies of internal energy infrastructures (heating, lighting, hot water, and cooling systems), as well as the poor behavioral practices in energy management. For the new construction, the main issues are the overarching failure to comply with the building codes regulating building thermal protection and general energy performance, as well as overall law technical capacity of the professionals in the construction sector to design and construct energy efficient buildings. 4.1.2 New Construction Housing construction was one of the driving forces of the economic boom in Armenia (26% of GDP) until 2008 financial crisis. But the number of completed dwellings remained low, and the construction sector started slowly recovering in 2012.

The 1995 construction code on \u201cThermal Protection of Buildings\u201d has had very poor enforcement from its adoption, it was never revisited to adapt to the new construction technologies and materials, neither has it been integrated into the context of Armenia\u2019s international cooperation 75 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT in the field of building energy performance regulation. These processes included the CIS Interstate Construction Norms development and harmonization, as well as approximation attempts of Armenia with the European Union\u2019s Directives, including the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive, within the Eastern Neighborhood Partnership Initiative (ENPI). The Ministry of Urban Development (MUD) is the key state institution responsible for the regulatory framework on building energy performance. In 2013 the bylaws of the MUD were updated (Governmental Decree N225-N) to add requirement to ensure energyefficiency and energy saving in the sector. For Armenia it is an issue of major importance with respect to its energy security, economic stability, social and environmental protection and the Government of the Republic of Armenia has regularly emphasized the importance it attaches to energy efficiency improvement both in existing and newly constructed buildings. Moreover, most of the investments in energy efficiency in buildings have positive economic features and can be financed with loan financing under close-to-commercial terms. However, there are a number of persistent barriers, such as legislative, institutional, socio-economic, and low-awareness that impede large-scale uptake of energy efficiency investments in the market. In particular, it is suggested that the government take the following urgent steps: To eliminate the barriers in the legal framework for energy efficiency: 1. Introduce binding legislation (a new law or a technical regulation) stipulating energy auditing, passportization, certification and labeling of buildings, mandatory enforcement of building energy codes with compulsory application to new buildings as well as with gradual application to already existing ones26 to harmonize with energy efficiency certification (EEC) policy and regulatory requirements and EU Directive on Energy Performance Indicators in Buildings. 2. The legal reform in the field of energy saving and energy efficiency to ECU membership and transposition of the ECU regulations. To implement this approach the following steps will be necessary: 3. Make appropriate changes and amendments in the Law on Urban Development allowing to stipulate mandatory norms for energy efficiency in design, construction and exploitation 26 It is noteworthy that, unlike other fields, this sector has a unique feature of energy efficiency mandatory application. In the field of industry, for instance, there are no incentives, no mixed private and common property areas, which would lead to inefficient use of energy, and industry owners possess capital investment funds (own or borrowed) for various modernization measures, including energy efficiency ones. In addition, in the industrial sector, the energy efficiency requirements, if imposed by Government, despite the cross-cutting monetary and non-monetary benefits, due to lack of awareness can be considered as an investment burden, barrier to growing local production, which is not politically acceptable, and not in line with the Government of RoA politics over the recent years to create favorable investment climate for local producers and international investors While the public sector does not usually need strong legal instruments, as the Government has its internal tools to implement energy efficiency measures in the public sector. As for the residential sector, it has a complex ownership structure, split interests in relation to private, rented and shared spaces, mixed property level in multi-apartment buildings; old buildings, limited access to capital, and a malfunctioning system of self-organization and collective decision-making. Therefore, in new buildings, where it is easier and less expensive to implement, the energy efficiency should be a mandatory norm and the energy efficiency of the existing buildings should be assessed and published. 76 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT phases for cases specified by legislation. 4. Based on the above requirements of the law, secondary legislation reflecting transposed relevant EEC regulations can be enacted These can be adopted as: a. Technical regulations in accordance with RA Law \u201cOn Technical Regulations\u201d can be adopted by RA Government Resolution (especially when there is unavoidable need to refer to international/regional/national standards). The technical regulations will define energy auditing, certification and labelling procedures in accordance with the local geographic and climatic conditions, and acting laws. b. Normative-technical documents based on the RA Law \u201cOn Urban Development\u201d (in cases where reference to international/regional/national standards is not necessary) 5. Assign clear responsibility and eliminate institutional overlap in this field of energy efficiency in buildings; The Republic of Armenia has abandoned the path towards association with the European Union, but the years spent in negotiations have shaped up the list and timeline of harmonization of the RoA legislation standards with the EU directives and standards, which has been approved by RoA Government resolution No.1481 from 22 November 2012. The transposition of the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive has been assigned to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources with support from line Ministries including Urban Development, Economy, Transport and Environment and was performed in the form of draft Technical Regulation with support of UNDP-GEF project. From the January 1st 2015 Republic of Armenia became full member of the Eurasian Customs Union (ECU). In this regard the policy in the fields of EE and RE is to update the existing legal and regulatory field to comply with ECU requirements. In particular that will affect the EE labelling of products, Energy Audit procedure and requirements, buildings EE certification, etc. Technologies and energy efficiency practices to be promoted - Energy efficient technologies/measures to be promoted: integrated building design approach, including building envelop, heating system, ventilation, solar water heating, and lighting. - Cost effective energy efficiency measures mainstreamed in the on-going renovation/ rehabilitation/seismic reinforcement of the existing buildings implemented in the framework of state programs. - Energy efficient management/maintenance practices, including building level and sector level energy management systems, and use of the building. The above issues have been outlined in the first NEEAP and dealt with in part by the ongoing reform efforts supported by donors. Pilot projects and financing schemes successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of various technical energy efficiency solutions, as well as organizational and crediting solutions, which have potential for scaling up. In other cases, such as the existing multi-apartment residential buildings, still efforts are needed to establish a 77 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT sustainable and functional solution for improving the energy efficiency of these buildings. The Table below summarizes the activities implemented aimed at meeting the regulatory objectives of the first NEEAP. The regulatory initiatives which have contributed to the achievement of the first NEEAP targets is presented below (the complex programs and initiatives which have both a regulatory and a financial element, as well as have mixed financing eligible for buildings and non-buildings projects are presented in the EE Financing Activity as cross-sectoral measure): 78 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Table 25.

As can be seen on Figure 28, only 40 % of the overall housing stock is over 40 years old. The private houses, comprising the one third of all housing space is relatively well maintained. A number of credit lines have been offering residential energy efficiency loans (IFC, EBRD, AFD/NMC, GGF) with some degree of incentives, such as lower interest rates or grant money back. This section reviews activities focusing on residential energy efficiency exclusively. The scale of impact of those credit lines, which finance residential energy efficiency among other sectors, is assessed in Table 26 among the cross-cutting measures. 87 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Housing Fund Structure by Year of Construction Housing Fund Structure by Number of Floors Housing Fund Structure by Wall Type Before 1970, 39 % 1970- 1990, 44% After 1990, 17 % 1-2, 51% 3-5, 35% 9 +, 12% 6-8, 2 % Monolith, 1244, 7% Panel, 4340, 23% Stone, 13206, 70% Figure 28. Structure of MAB stock by age, floors, and construction material Yet in the multi-apartment housing this trend has not evolved. The overall ownership scheme in multi-apartment buildings and of management and maintenance of common owned property is highly inefficient, which hampers the uptake of energy efficiency opportunities by the multi- apartment housing market. The 2002 Law on Apartment Building Management did not adequately legislate and enforce the rights and responsibilities of condominiums. Consequently, multi-apartment housing repair and maintenance does not work well. Deterioration worsens from year to year. Not less than 75% of all roofs and roof drain systems are in urgent need for repair. A growing number of residential buildings are in urgent danger of physical destruction. This situation aggravates the serious seismic risk in Armenia. Investments in housing repairs are insufficient. For example, in 2008 less than AMD 1 billion ($ 2.7 mln) was invested in the whole stock of multi-apartment buildings. The extremely low maintenance fees allow for not even the most urgent repair works. Similar serious is the collection rate of hardly over 60%. Debts on maintenance fees are set too low to supply sufficient funds for adequate maintenance, and are very difficult to levy. Clarification and a redefinition of the roles of owners on the one hand and of the management organizations on the other hand are urgently needed. Several initiatives have thoroughly analyzed the origins of the problems in the existing housing sector, and repeatedly concluded that the lack of investments in housing repair and maintenance, as well as adequate thermal rehabilitation. To address the issues within the housing sector, the conservation and maintenance of common space and supporting infrastructure in urban housing, the Armenian Government with assistance from partners (international aid organizations) has pursued major policy reform efforts that concern utility supply, public utility regulation, organization of multi-apartment building management bodies and condominiums, housing policies, municipal budget autonomy, revenues, etc. To date, the accumulated experience and expertise have demonstrated that energy efficiency improvements can help vulnerable households in Armenia, and that energy efficiency is the quickest, cleanest and cheapest way to bring comfort and economic mitigation to these 88 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT households. IFI resources can cover only a small fraction of the investment needs of this sector; the private sector should thus be tapped for investment capital to address the modernization and efficiency improvement needs over the next 20-30 years. The potential for energy efficiency in the buildings sector has been estimated. Armenia is not an exception: the latest studies have confirmed potential for energy saving. The National Program on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy estimates 40 percent potential for energy saving in Armenia\u2019s building sector. According to the results of donor-funded pilot projects, an average residential building in Armenia has 30-50% potential for energy saving at current energy prices. The most illustrative of all were the pilot projects implemented by UNDP/GEF Improving Energy Efficiency in Buildings project. The thermal modernization of a multi-apartment panel building in Yerevan reduced 178kWh/m2 energy consumption to 74kWh/m2 after thermal rehabilitation of the building fa\u00e7ade. Moreover, the Habitat for Humanity of Armenia (HFHA) has also found the lending model and implemented loan-funded thermal envelopingof 3 existing typical panel buildings. The Municipality of Yerevan has provided grant co-financing for such loan-financed projects within the scope of a bi- lateral memorandum of understanding with HFHA. In some cases, the investments received a modest co-financing by residents (home-owners\u2019 association). In addition to EBRD, IFC and GGF loans for energy efficiency investments, the French Development Agency (AFD) and the National Mortgage Company (NMC) have launched the \u201cJerm Ojakh\u201d Social Energy Efficiency Renovation Program for Armenia\u2019s Housing Sector. KfW plans to launch a Housing Energy Efficiency Credit line in 2016, which will also be partnered with NMC and seek to cover another niche for residential energy efficiency. The barriers to energy efficiency investments in multi-apartment residential buildings can be summarized as follows: \u2022 Lack of housing strategy or clear policy on state/local government responsibilities to vulnerable groups; \u2022 Clear separation of responsibilities among state and local authorities; \u2022 Private-sector involvement in housing industry and finance; \u2022 Improvements of eviction, foreclosure and bankruptcy mechanisms to conduct legally transparent and sustainable transactions in real estate, including sales and other transfers of nonperforming loans and, Implementation and enforcement of acting laws and regulations in the field of multi- apartment building maintenance and management \u2022 \u2022 Weak capacity for building management, project development, financial planning and management, fund-raising, human resources, reporting and customer/member relations. \u2022 Survey revealed up to 20% HOA managers still initiate cash-paid service recruitment \u2022 Up to 20% of HOAs implement maintenance work no more frequently than once every 1-2 years \u2022 Lack of financial resources due to low maintenance fee rates and low collection; \u2022 Poor creditworthiness due to their new status, slow development, failure to collect service fees, and failure to conduct creditworthy accounting, bookkeeping and reporting. 89 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT \u2022 Difficulty securing the necessary number of votes for strategic decision-making with respect to heat supply issues; the situation is exacerbated by the growing number of autonomous apartment-level solutions) and the significant share of absentee households (~20%); \u2022 The need, often, to sign individual loan repayment and service supply contracts with each households due to mistrust and lack of experience of purchasing utility services from the intermediary. \u2022 Lack of overall awareness and understanding of the legal-regulatory framework, rights and responsibilities related with the home-owners\u2019 associations, and benefits of EE, in general. To adequately direct investments in this sector, policy reform, capacity building, outreach and adequate financing schemes are necessary. The RA Law on Condominiums should be recognized as ineffective. The Ministry of Urban Development recognized the need to amend or rewrite Law on MAB Management, with appropriate amendments to be provided to the RA Civil Code regarding provisions of management of multi-apartment buildings, and the RA Government Decree N1161-N on Adoption of Obligatory Norms of for Maintenance of the MAB Common Shared Properties revisited. This reform must be accompanied by a national program for promoting residential building energy efficiency, aimed at the following actions: \uf0b7 Assess the investment needs of the sector (including for financing of the 5-year Strategic plan of MAB housing fund management, maintenance and exploitation of RA adopted by Minutes decree of RA Government #38 on 29.09.2011) \uf0b7 Define the procedures for lending to MAB management and/or maintenance bodies, and availability of state subsidies for organizing comprehensive refurbishment and energy efficiency retrofits in the housing stock \uf0b7 Design a financing scheme with features customized to economic features MAB retrofit projects, with \u2018soft\u2019 terms, and combined with grant financing and technical assistance \uf0b7 Seeking grant resources to support investments for low-income households from state social safety funds; \uf0b7 Cultivate PPPs to facilitate investment in MABs, eliminate legal & institutional barriers for attracting private capital. \uf0b7 Utilize lessons learned from demo projects, test-drive programs on small-scale pilots. \uf0b7 Seek opportunities to capitalize on sectoral programs to finance housing rehabilitation (environmental, EE, seismic, etc.) \uf0b7 When loan-financing investments in MABs, have special provisions (grants) for vulnerable households. \uf0b7 Enable the participation of the HOAs in residential investment projects by finding creative solutions for loan financing. \uf0b7 Collect adequate M&E data through to document impacts and fine-tune the programs for improved effectiveness. To strengthen the institutional capacities for improved efficiency of energy use in the housing Sector 1. Capacity strengthening for the relevant State institutions and public services related to the energy efficiency in buildings for overseeing existing buildings and ensuring effective enforcement of the MAB management and condominium policy including HOAs, regional and 90 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT local authorities, energy auditors, urban development inspection, private housing maintenance companies, as well as financial institutions interested in lending for housing maintenance and energy efficiency. Technical assistance with respect to home-owners\u2019 associations (HOAs) ability to participate in the new procedures stipulated by the 5-year Strategy Program and overall reform in the sector, including lending to HOAs for EE improvements, competitive procurement of private maintenance services by HOAs, assessment of buildings\u2019 energy efficiency potential, conduct of energy audits, development of energy efficiency investment projects, passportization of buildings\u2019, etc Raise public Awareness providing information on end-use energy efficiency measures and their benefits to decision-makers as well as consumers. Recommended features of an effective financing scheme for residential energy efficiency: Design a Financing Scheme with features customized to economic features MAB retrofit projects, with \u2018soft\u2019 terms, and combined with grant financing and technical assistance Seeking grant resources to support energy efficiency programs for low-income households from state social safety funds to replace traditional tariff subsidies for natural gas; Cultivate public-private partnerships private maintenance or energy service companies with municipalities, private housing maintenance firms and HOAs to facilitate the elimination of institutional barriers while attracting private capital. Utilize lessons learned from demonstration projects to inform government policies on the choice of institutional and regulatory reforms, and test-drive the programs on small-scale pilot scale, roll-out to offer a standard solution in regular commercial banks/local financial institutions (LFIs). Seek opportunities to capitalize on environmental benefits of energy efficiency in residential buildings, for instance through environmental funds or carbon financing.

Collect adequate data through monitoring and evaluation to document impacts and fine-tune the programs for improved effectiveness. Create security funds to insure loans for condominiums in the case of collateral deficiency; Provide funds for reconstruction, energy efficiency measures, preparation of technical and financial documents as well as for the application of innovative technologies. The financial and economic benefits of energy efficient building are well-researched and documented internationally. Many energy efficiency investments have a short payback periods in terms of reduced energy costs (considering energy efficiency in the design of a building could even reduce construction costs. The few studies considering the national circumstances of Armenia (construction costs, established market prices for construction materials, heating, conditioning and ventilation costs) confirm 91 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT these findings.28The profitability of energy efficiency will further increase with rising energy prices. This will for public buildings and social housing result in a substantial saving of the scare public resources for construction and operation of buildings. For residential buildings energy efficiency will be the only way to maintain utility affordability with the rising energy prices, while maintaining an adequate comfort level. National Program for MAB Housing EE Retrofits It is recommended that the pilot project experiences from UNDP/GEF and HFHA/REELIH programs are scaled up into a national program for residential energy efficiency addressing the policy reform, capacity building, development and scaling up of a sustainable financing scheme for multi-apartment building retrofits in Armenia. See new EEIM proposed (measure II.10). LED Lights for Low-Income Households In addition to the investments and measures to help reduce the building sector demand for heating energy, the residential sector needs support dealing with the growing electricity prices. As discussed earlier in regulatory section, the rising energy tariffs have had substantial impact on energy affordability and social acceptance of the announced tariff increase, triggering civil unrest. To avoid another instance, when the Government spend scarce public funds to subsidize the energy prices to avoid political turmoil, it is recommended that the energy social safety nets make a transition from tariff subsidies to subsidized energy efficiency programs for low-income households. The latest 7% increase proposed for electricity prices needs to be remedied with such assistance. About 40% of electricity use in low-income households (Armenia has 225,000 poor households, of which 105,000 \u2013 classified as extremely poor) is for lighting purposes. To help manage the electricity consumption within affordability limits, it is proposed to offer replacement LED lights-bulbs to low-income families. (See Measure II.11). Appliance Energy Labeling Outreach Another tool that helps the population deal with the energy demand-side management, for middle- to high-income range population, is the appliance energy labeling. The UNDP-GEF had prepared a draft Government Decision and energy labelling regulation, which were both submitted to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources for adoption. The adoption was on hold before the political rout with regards to EU association and ECU membership is resolved. Now with Armenia\u2019s member status in ECU, the regulatory package must be 28The 2007 National Program of RA for Energy Saving and Renewable Energy estimated a total annual energy saving potential in the building sector equivalent to 331 ktoe through improvement of thermal protection of buildings, introducing energy efficient lighting and heating systems. 92 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT adapted and adopted. Upon adoption, enforcement of appliance energy labeling regulation requires a substantial outreach effort to help introduce the labels, disseminate information and adequately inform consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions.

End: end of 2012. Timeframe n o i t p i r c s e D Aim/brief description The measure continues with anticipated certain changes, additions and improvements. Using the provisions of the EC Directives as the basis for defining labelling requirements, in 2010 the UNDP-GEF project conducted a study to find the best approach for introducing an energy efficiency labelling system for energy consuming household appliances in Armenia. As a result of this study, a draft Government Decision and energy labelling regulation were developed. Since this was the first time a labelling regulation had been applied in Armenia, a phased approach was proposed, with only a limited number of household appliances subject to labelling in the first phase. The prepared materials need to be harmonized with the Eurasian Economic Union requirements and a labeling outreach campaign designed and launched. The list of appliances subject to labelling would then be gradually enlarged. To this aim, the corresponding international and European (CEN) standards on testing the energy performance of selected energy-consuming household appliances were translated and adopted. The UNDP-GEF prepared a draft Government Decision and energy labelling regulation, which were both submitted to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources for adoption. Approval was expected in 2013. Not adopted until now.

The number and area of public buildings in Armenia, 2013 Source: NSS, and calculations of authors based on average building size, where statistics was not available. 104 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Majority of public buildings are under governmental ownership, control and direct co- financing. The Ministry of Urban Development is the lead state agency in the field of housing construction and urban development, while other branch ministries manage and oversee their respective premises (e.g. Ministry of Health in charge of medical institutions) for the purposes is routine maintenance and repair. Majority of public buildings have very low energy performance, largely due to the age, poor condition of building envelope as well as lack of adequate energy management. On average such buildings have 10-70% potential for energy saving. With energy costs comprising 5-20% of running costs of most public institutions, they still supply an average comfort level of approximately 40%. The current financing scheme of public institutions per person (per patient bed in hospitals, per student at educational facilities) created a possibility to utilize borrowed resources for energy efficiency retrofits, and cover the investments from savings. Such energy saving agreements have successfully been implemented by Armenia\u2019s Renewable Resources program (worth 10.7 million USD) supported by the World Bank and implemented by the R2E2 Fund. The program is targeted to implement energy saving activities in public facilities to reduce the level of energy consumption by social and other public facilities. - Energy efficiency would free up the scarce public budgets for this sector. Without energy efficiency, the expected increase of energy prices will increase the demand for public budgets. - Within the overall framework of the national energy security and growing energy prices, and constrained budget resources in public buildings, energy efficiency is the shortest, cheapest way to help reduce country\u2019s energy import dependence, curtail the energy expenditures of public budgets, while mitigating climate change. - Finally, addressing this sector could secure the necessary market transformation, which will have an indirect impact on private buildings (housing and commercial buildings) as well. As to energy efficiency in building reconstruction, despite the higher cost (than in case of new construction) the growing energy prices have made these investments cost-effective. The GEF-funded program in Armenia targeted to building energy efficiency (R2E2\u2019s \u201cEnergy Efficiency Project\u201d and \u201cImproving Energy Efficiency in Buildings\u201d UNDP-GEF project) have proven that energy efficiency investments with positive net present value and 7 years of simple payback can save over 50% of energy compared to baseline consumption both in residential and public buildings. R2E2 experience in public building energy efficiency retrofits firstly indicated that these buildings were in such poor state of maintenance and repair that would require substantial investments in rehabilitation without prospects for cost recovery. R2E2 estimated with incremental investments of about $17-20 per m2 (this is equivalent to approximately 10% of the common average $200/m2 for comprehensive building rehabilitation) the natural gas consumption for heating can be reduced twice, correspondingly the GHG emissions will be reduced by around 50%. The baseline heating energy demand of 120-125kWh/m2/year is ensuring only 40-50% comfort level, the EE measures allowed improving the comfort to acceptable levels within the existing budget constraints. These improvements are achieved by a 105 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT improvement package comprehensive energy efficiency insulation of walls/finishing, replacement of doors and windows, replacement of windows by walls, and roof insulation, after an efficient heating system has already been put in place. The R2E2 credit line has very strict eligibility criteria and can only finance energy efficiency measures which have attractive economic indicators (positive net present value) and only accept applications from public buildings where the comfort level is beyond 50%. As a result, the energy efficiency measures which may result in substantial greenhouse gas mitigation but has lower cost-effectiveness or is proposed for suppressed demand conditions will not be eligible for finance. including The demand for energy efficient construction and renovation is much larger than the funds, currently available in Armenia. To this purpose, this component aims to attract (international) concessional finance to further increase the number of funding in new construction (including through the PPP scheme under consideration of MUD according to the 2014 Action Plan) and to the public buildings to be rehabilitated incorporating the energy efficiency requirements. Despite the 58% energy saving and climate change mitigation potential, an average of $200 million is being invested in public and social housing buildings without concern for energy efficiency due to poor legal gaps and poor enforcement, lack of awareness of the benefits of energy efficiency, limited technical and institutional capacity to pursue change, lack of incentives, etc. The recent Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) Project developed by UNDP to seek climate finance proposes to leverage grant resources which can cover the incremental cost of energy efficiency investments at the time of major renovation and reconstruction of public buildings, or new construction of public buildings and social housing. The NAMA project is in harmony with the state policy in this sector. As the regulatory section reported, the protocol decision #1504-N of RA Government \u201cOn implementation of energy saving and energy efficiency improvement measures in facilities being constructed (reconstructed, renovated) under the state funding\" sets the policy requirement for major public investments in urban development to be integrated with energy efficiency. 106 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Table 27.

The current eligibity criteria have put at least 100 appications in the rejection list. Considering the limitations of the current lending scheme it is important that an alternative financing mechanism is worked out to address the energy efficiency investment needs in those 200 public institutions. From the full NSS databank of Armenia\u2019s all public buildings, the average public building size is 3292m2. Overall, the unserved demand for energy efficiency retrofits for these indicative 658,000m2comprises $11,851,806, and has energy saving potential of This is particularly important because the submission of the application to R2E2 indicates the political will and readiness of the management in these institutions to commit to energy efficinecy improvement measures, loan repayment, etc. To favor this positive trend, the E5P project idnetification mission has proposed an alternative lending scheme with grant co- financing to supplement the R2E2 credit line for public building EE. The alternative conditions proposed were as follows : \u2022 Comfort level > 40% (instead of the current \u201c> 50%\u201d, because studies show that an average public building has a comfort level of 35%, which makes many perfectly good project ineligible) \u2022 Estimated energy savings > 20% \u2022 NPV >0 \u2022 Simple payback < 10 years Investment > $ 50 000 \u2022 Expansion of acting R2E2 credit line for public and municipal building energy efficiency retrofits under energy performance contracting scheme. It is proposed to expand the credit line to include approximately 100 projects (each project usually covers one municipal/public building or 107 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT a street-lighting system) which have not met the eligibility criteria of the GEF-funded credit line.

Although this has been accompanied by growth of the gross agricultural product (GAP), energy use has increased at a significantly faster rate than has GAP since 2011. As a result, the energy intensity of agricultural output has increased, leading to higher net energy use per unit of output. This is largely due to inefficient machinery (e.g., pumps) and irrational irrigation water use (e.g., over-irrigating), as well as the transition from largely manual agricultural practices to more technology- and machinery-driven practices. According to the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) of the Republic of Armenia, 93% of existing agricultural machinery originated during Soviet times and is technologically obsolete.

Theenergy 111 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT consumed in this sector is largely in the form of natural gas and motor fuels; the agricultural sector accounts for only 2% of total final electricity consumption. 140.1 141.9 7.4% 1.3% 6.6% 180.0 160.0 140.0 120.0 100.0 80.0 60.0 40.0 20.0 0.0 9.3% 155.1 164.8 6.3% 7.4% 8.4% 17% 15% 13% 11% 9% 7% 5% 3% 1% -1% 2010 2011 2012 2014 Energy Use in Agriculture & Forestry Share in Total Final Energy Consumption % increase Figure 31. Dynamics of energy consumption in agricultural sector (energy use for 2010-2012 from EC-LEDS Energy Balance, for 2014 \u2013 authors\u2019 own calculations based on PSR & NSS data) Armenia\u2019s agricultural policies are driven by the government\u2019s Strategy for Sustainable Rural and Agricultural Development for the period 2010-2020 (published in 2010). The Strategy specifies the key directions for Armenia\u2019s policy in the agriculture sector, defines sectorial priorities, and identifies preferred areas of specialization for higher sustainability, as well as social and economic indicators. The Strategy sets the following targets that affect agricultural energy use: \u2022 The volume of agricultural production in 2020 will exceed the 2007-2009 average level by 64% Total area of cropland will increase by 39% Areas under fodder crops will increase by 58%, and perennial plantings by 38% Livestock population will increase (large animals by 10.4%, sheep and goats by 62%, pigs by 45%, and poultry by 46%); livestock productivity will also increase through improvements in pedigree stock breeding, feeding and farming practices. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The strategy also envisages the consolidation of farms and development of agrarian cooperatives, the improvement of credit, the development of risk mitigation measures, the development of organic agriculture, efforts to reduce vulnerability to climate change, and the development of social infrastructure in rural communities. As noted, the growth in energy consumption in the agricultural sector has been largely attributed to the aging fleet of agricultural machinery, and the transition from manual processes to machine- 112 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT driven agricultural processes (with new machinery added even before the old fleet is phased out). In addition, there has beensignificant growth in the greenhouse industry as well as increasing irrigation demand to meet the growing demand for agricultural crops and an increasing amount of aquaculture (fish nurseries). Thus, these sub-activities of the agricultural sector are the focus of the agricultural section of the second NEEAP. Table 30.

The remaining 7% (885 different models of tractors) has been imported, financed largely by grants from IFIs, donors and the Armenian Government. The greenhouse subsector has grown dramatically, from only 5 hectares in 2011 to 114 ha in 2015, and this growth trend is projected to continue. By 2020,Armenia is expected to have 634 ha of commercial greenhouses \u2013 a growing industry, with growing energy demands; even the smaller greenhouses built in 2010-2012 consume over 3.5 million m3of natural gas per hectare. Natural gas consumption thus almost doubledin this sector during 2010-2012 (See Figure 32). Considering the expected expansion of the horticulture sector in Armenia and the energy intensity of this field, improving the efficiency of energy use in existing greenhouses as well as in planned greenhouse designs is of critical importance. According to the data reported by the private sector, modern design and economies of scale for greenhouses can deliver ten times the output using the same energy use. Thus, if the greenhouse industry receives technical assistance and favorable financing, technological upgrades of existing greenhouses as well as intelligent design 113 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT of new greenhouses can significantly reduce the rate of growth in energy use of this sector,enabling the sustainable growth of commercially viable and cost-competitive greenhouses. 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 407.3 423.6 634 587.5 391.0 541 358.5 374.8 494.5 448 450.0 400.0 350.0 300.0 250.0 200.0 150.0 100.0 50.0 - 19.6 5 21.6 12 28.9 16 124.7 114 84.8 47 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 GH Hectares Gas consumption - EE GHs (mln m3) Figure 32. Natural Gas Consumption in the Greenhouses and hectares of Greenhouses in 2010\u20132012 (Source: Armenian Harvest Promotion Centre CJSC, ArmRusGas) Another emerging sector is cultured fish production \u2013 aquaculture in fish nurseries.31A Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) study has estimated that, as of 2011,Armenia\u2019s total annual fish production is 5,000\u20135,500 tons from 233 fish farms occupying about 2,720 hectares. This sector is also growing rapidly. Since regulations now require that fish farms circulate the deep-water well groundwater that they extract for fisheries, the electricity use in this sector is expected to increase dramatically. To mitigate the energy impact of this practice, it will be necessary to develop and implement energy efficiency solutions for cultured fish production technology. A case study by the Regional Environmental Center revealed significant potential for energy resource efficiency in one of the operating fisheries sized 31.5 hectares: Almost 200 MWh of electricity can be saved annually.just by upgrading the air compression and conditioning technology. This represents a 17% reduction in energy costs associated with fish production at this site. It is noteworthy that these energy efficiency measures also improve the feeding efficiency and productivity of the fishery overall. Considering the growing significance of this sector in Armenia, providing fish nurseries with technical assistance and access to affordable finance should be a priority. It is important to note that energy solutions in the fisheries subsector overlap with those inthe industrial sector, considering the industrial scales of many fisheries enterprises as well as the further processing and packaging of raw fish into ready food products. The proposed activities for the industry sector related to ISO 50001, resource efficiency and clean production and introduction of best available technologies are thus relevant for the fisheries sector and should be included in proposed measures for aquaculture/fish nurseries. Since 2010, when the first NEEAP was developed, the Government of Armenia and a number of donors and IFIs have implemented a wide range of programs that have implicitly or explicitly delivered energy efficiency measures to the agricultural sector. These programs have included improvement of irrigation networks and water supply facilities, upgrading machinery and equipment, modernization of aquaculture and greenhouses to serve the broader objectives of 31 Source: FAO Study. Available at  114 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT supporting rural communities, and increasing the sector\u2019s productivity and competitiveness. Some of these measures have been aimed directly at improving energy efficiency in agriculture; others havehelped improve the sector\u2019s energy efficiency indirectly. The main financiers of these projects have been international organizations and the Government of Armenia. The private sector also contributes significant investments to the sector, mainly for aquaculture and greenhouses. Table 1 summarizes related activitiesimplemented as part of the first NEEAP, as well as new measures proposed for the second NEEAP to help accelerate the introduction of efficient energy and water use in the agricultural sector. It is noteworthy, that the second NEEAP team has identified a substantially larger portfolio of programs and projects in the agrcultural sector, which can assumed to have a significant energy and water sector impact with great certainty. However, due to the lack of reporting and basic metrics available from these activities, it was not possibly to assess their impact on the sector\u2019s energy consumption to date or expected impact until 2020. These initiatives, however, have been documented and filed in the second NEEAP for further tracking within the consecutive NEEAPs. 115 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Table 31.

Grading agricultural products based on quality Renewing the agricultural machinary park Install gravity irrigation Creating mechanisms for grading agricultural products based on quality for the processing industry. This is especially important for the grape processing sector. This will focus farmers\u2019 attention on the proper agro management, which in turn means providing adequate volume of water to the plants. Most of the agricultural machinery equipment is in the private hands. These owners are established service providers in their communities. However, they do not generate sufficient funds to replace their old and obsolete machinery with newer equipment. The new equipment tends to be given to the agricultural cooperatives under state or other donor subsidy mechanisms. Usually the cooperative members are small holder growers and are not capable of properly operating and maintaining the equipment. This lack of skills and knowledge drastically cuts the useful life of the equipment. Transformation into gravity irrigation will contribute into energy saving, because pumping system installed in Soviet Union periods is very expensive to operate. This action will result to energy saving, for example in 2013 the energy consumption of water supply companies dramatically reduced from 129 watt/hour to 25 watt/hour. 3 1 . I V 5 1 . I V 6 1 .

These included the following programs: \uf0b7 Rural development program brought Government support in negotiations and import of288 units of high efficiency agricultural machinery \uf0b7 Operational Development Assistance from Japanese Government supported importing 171 high efficiency tractors; \uf0b7 The World Bank implemented several rural and community development programs aimed at irrigation system enhancement, emergency irrigation rehabilitation, community agricultural resource management and competitiveness, as well as municipal water supply. The WB also plans to launch a new program aimed at Irrigation System Modernization and Institutional Capacity Building with a complex portfolio of irrigation improvement projects. \uf0b7 USAID through its Clean Energy and Water Project supported water supply improvements in Berkaber, Lukashin, Arazap villages, potable water supply project in Hartavan village; \uf0b7 The GEF Small Grants Program supported Parakal community decentralized wastewater treatment, \uf0b7 Water supply and sanitation sector project \uf0b7 Agriculture and rural development, ENPI, ADA \uf0b7 Science technology innovation partnership (stip) \uf0b7 Energy efficient greenhouse \uf0b7 Farmer education on irrigation management \uf0b7 Grading agricultural products based on quality \uf0b7 Renewing the agricultural machinary park \uf0b7 Establishment of agricultural groups/cooperatives \uf0b7 Install gravity irrigation Considering The international best practices in the context of Armenian agriculture, the following measures need to be implemented in order to further improve the energy efficiency and competitiveness of the agricultural sector: \uf06e Addressing the problem of regular electricity supply at relatively low cost through effective use of solar, land, underground, water energy alternatives in mountainous and border villages. \uf06e Farmer education on irrigation management: Many of the farmers in Armenia over- irrigate their plots considering the abundance of water a positive impact for the plants and trees. This practice is counter-productive and even damaging for many plants, including apricot trees and grape vineyards. Education of farmers is necessary on sustainable irrigation practices, which will not only help optimize the water use and improve harvest productivity, but also save substantial amounts of energy. \uf06e Continue the modernization of the agricultural machinery and equipment park as well as the equipment park database management, as 92% of current tractors and 80% of 122 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT combine harvesters are more than 25 years old. Most of the agricultural machinery equipment is in the private hands. These owners are established service providers in their communities. However, they do not generate sufficient funds to replace their old and obsolete machinery with newer equipment. The new equipment tends to be given to the agricultural cooperatives under state or other donor subsidy mechanisms. Usually the cooperative members are small-scale holder/growers and are not capable of properly operating and maintaining the equipment. This lack of skills and knowledge drastically cuts the useful life of the equipment. If the trend continues, there will be a serious risk of losing the cadre of the community tractorists. So, there should be a program directed to these individuals or the cooperatives should be encouraged to integrate the community mechanizators into their group.This activity should be integrated with the continued establishment of agricultural groups and cooperatives, which generally contributes to the scale effects of grouping smaller producers and harvesting benefits from shared access to cost-intensive technical solutions. \uf06e Meanwhile the current database of the agricultural machinery lacks quality information and is poorly managed. To be able to support and track the effect of the fuel-efficient technology adaptation in the country, one needs to have access to indicators on the use of existing modern equipment is being utilized in the country. This data is not available at this stage. One of the ways to improve the registration system is implementation of a general system of agriculture administrative register. \uf06e Continue focusing on the gravity irrigation programs:The pumping system inherited from Soviet Union is too expensive to operate. In order to avoid huge costs of inefficient electricity use in those systems the gravity irrigation system needs to be installed where possible. \uf06e Focus on waste water collection and waste management in general:There are 20 factories, which are engaged in wastewater cleaning. However, those factories are inefficient, physically and morally obsolete. Investing in new technologies directed to wastewater cleaning will substantially improve the energy use of this sector, as well as the volumes of water saved. \uf06e Armenia has significant water resources ensuring development of aquaculture. In this context, an important problem is the excess use of water and electricity by this sector. Installation of dissolved oxygen concentration readers inaquaria, allowing working out air-conditioning equipment can be considered as one of the best methods of saving electricity. Within the scope of RECP energy efficiency programs a similar project was implemented in Unifish LLC in 2014. The expected annual energy saving after the project implementation for just one fish farm was194 MW/year (or AMD 7,153,920). \uf06e In order to make the use of agricultural resource potential more effective, a special attention should be paid to promotion of creation of greenhouses in farming entities. The following activities need to be implemented: o Provision of tax privileges for import of main equipment and construction materials needed for creation of greenhouses, 123 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT o Provision of affordable targeted loans for creation of greenhouses for farmers. Implemented within the scope of first NEEAP, the energy efficiency projects listed below were/are aimed at mitigating the increase in energy intensity of agriculture. 124 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Title of the energy saving measure Rural development program: high efficiency agricultural machinery import Index of the measure VI.1 Category Timeframe Agriculture Machinery Start: 2013 End: Ongoing Aim/brief description Since 2013 after negotiations with the Republic of Belarus, 288 comparatively affordable wheeled tractors MTZ -82.1,40 units plow L-108, 20 units square baler PT-165M, 2 units precision seed sower SPCH-6LT,4 units potato Planting machine L-201,19 units potato digger KTN-2V,8 units hoe L-131-7, 15 units lawn mowers - 2.1 and 6 units universal pneumatic seeder SPU-4d were imported through SMEDNZ, Target end-use Farmers Target group Ministry of Agriculture Regional application National List and description of energy saving actions substantiating the measure Budget and financial source Implementing body Monitoring authority Method for monitoring/measuring the resulting savings Expected savings in 2014 as per 1st EEAP MWH/year Expected savings in 2017 as per 1st EEAP Expected achieved in 2018 MWH/year Expected energy savings in 2020 Expected impact on energy savings in 2020 (if available) Tasks to be implemented are: 1.

These owners are established service providers in their communities. However, they do not generate sufficient funds to replace their old and obsolete machinery with newer equipment. The new equipment tends to be given to the agricultural cooperatives under state or other donor subsidy mechanisms. Usually the cooperative members are small holder growers and are not capable of properly operating and maintaining the equipment. This lack of skills and knowledge drastically cuts the useful life of the equipment. If the trend continues, there will be a serious risk of losing the cadre of the community tractorists. So, there should be a program directed to these individuals or the cooperatives should be encouraged to integrate the community mechanizators into their group. Replacement of the old tractors with new once would result in 20% fuel savings. The current database of the agricultural machinery lacks quality information and is poorly managed.

The relationship between these two groups is regulated by the market, which in this situation creates loose-loose situation for both groups, because the agricultural fields are usually several kilometers away from the community. On the one side the farmers has to pay extra for the fule for the tractorist to reach the plot and. On the other side the tractorist uses the useful life of the tractor on the roads to reach small land plots. This useful life could have been spent on ploughing, spraying, harvesting, or any other mechanization requesting activities that are so much needed in the fields today. Furthermore, for this trip the tractorists do not recieve payment other than fuel compensation. This extra fuel cost to reach the plots is about 10% of the total fuel cost.

Municipal heat and hot water supply systems in Armenian cities essentially collapsed because of the economic and energy crisis that followed the separation of Armenia from the former Soviet Union in 1990. Though centralized district heating (DH) systems have been partially restored in some cities, most of the urban population does not have access to organized heat and hot water supply services. The population switched to gas-, electricity- or wood-fired individual heating systems with varying levels of efficiency. Well managed district heat systems are more efficient and can be a better solution for Armenia, especially if utilizing renewable energy sources. Considering Armenia\u2019s potential for geothermal energy utilization, it is important to consider 164 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT geothermal heat pumps as a district heating technology. If successful, this solution can be scaled up to larger share of consumers. Today, in some large public and private service buildings heat is supplied by centralized boiler systems while smaller residential buildings mostly use local heating systems. However, most of the buildings equipped with central boiler systems operate inefficiently due to poor maintenance or old age. Refurbishment or reconstruction of these systems would result in a significant decrease in energy intensity and greatly reduce the maintenance burden. The latest WB Armenia Power Sector Policy Note highlighted the urgent need for investment to mitigate the emerging energy supply gap. For example, the least efficient thermal power plant, Hrazdan TPP has an efficiency of 31%. This highly inefficient plant is currently used as the circuit station and needs to run post 2016 thus incurring heavy cost burden on the generation. This power station has been targeted for refurbishment with a new gas-fired 500 MW combined cycle gas turbine planned to be operational by 2020. Aside from the generation, several transmission assets are in a state of disrepair and require urgent maintenance and modernization to maintain supply reliability. WB compared the Armenian transmission networks with the well-performing US and European networks, and found 2.5 higher outages per transmission line. The improved transmission reliability will significantly reduce energy losses. Several transmission project related investments are underway and planned in this direction and presented in Table 34. 4.4.2 Energy Management and Clean Production Industrial and SME Affordability of tariffs for both natural gas and electricity has become a major concern not only for the population, but also the large industrial consumers and SMEs. Energy efficiency can help the local producers remain competitive under the conditions of growing energy prices. When energy prices increased in 2013, the National Association of Manufacturers, Entrepreneurs and Employers (NAMEE) requested Government support for seeking energy savings and energy efficiency solutions. In response, the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and the Ministry of Economy worked with the NAMEE to develop specific steps to reduce energy intensity in industry and improve competitiveness. Recent pilot projects and technical assistance programs implemented by donors have identified the great potential to improve energy efficiency in industry through implementation of energy management systems, building capacity in energy auditing and application of best available technology practices for energy efficiency. It has been estimated that these initiatives could reduce energy intensity by 20% with a reasonable financial return on investment. Some of the identified measures include: 165 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT \uf0a7 UNIDO/REC Resource Efficiency and Clean Production Program, with RECP audits of 10 pilot enterprises revealed 15-20% cost effective energy and water use reduction possibilities; \uf0a7 Ministry of Nature Protection transposing BREF notes for application of best available technologies in various sectors of the economy (including cement production and copper smelters) identified 15-18% reduction in energy use, accompanying the technological changes aimed at reducing environmental pollution. The international best practice for a country like Armenia is to set up a Cleaner Production Assistance Center. Such a center(s) work with the of Government and academia in assisting industry through outreach programs, trainings, subsidized energy audits, dissemination of information on best available technologies, benchmarking, etc. There is a potentially great value added effect for academic institutions helping industry through outreach and research in EE and RE and thus increasing the opportunity for academic institutions to conduct more research which will provide more training for future industry participants (student and researchers). Hence, this activity must be carried out incombination with the development of adequate university curricula and preparation of adequate professorial cadre, to further prepare qualified industrial energy managers and auditors. This all contributes to improving competitiveness of the country. 4.4.3 Financing of Industrial and SME Energy Efficiency Concurrently, several IFIs (GGF, IFC, EBRD, and soon KfW) have offered sustainable energy financing for industrial and SME borrowers during 2010-2015, with some of these loans accompanied with subsidized energy audits. Although these IFIs have not forecasted future lending plans, but it can reasonably be assumed that the same lending trend will persist and potentially accelerate in the light of growing energy costs. KfW, for example, is expected to launch a new credit line in 2016. Table 33 summarizes the data supplied by IFIs for this sector. Table 33.

Implementation of ISO 5001 compliant energy management systems, conducting energy audits, and dissemination of knowledge about benchmarking practices will contribute to the increased quality of economic growth and clean production in Armenia. initiating a program The NEEAP proposes for supporting energy resource efficiency transformation programs for large industrial companies (large energy consumers) for promotion of best practices and to accelerate the identification, planning, and implementation of high impact energy efficiency measures. Fundamentally, the program must be aimed at mainstreaming energy management and resource efficiency in large energy consuming enterprises to ensure sustainable outcomes. The program will start with implementation of ISO 50001 Energy Management in industry. This program must be developed in cooperation with the Ministry of Energy and Natural resources, the Ministry of Economy, National Association of Entrepreneurs and Employers, Armenia\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, Regional Environmental Center (REC) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), major players in industry. The program must build a network for introducing energy management best practice, encouraging cooperation, and developing a platform for sharing lessons learned on site. The program should be introduced through voluntary compliance schemes, benchmarking, coordination with financiers for soft financing terms on targeted loans, awareness, outreach, and a clear recognition process highlighting positive outcomes. 167 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT 4.4.4 EE-Integrated Renewable Energy Sources Armenia does not have any domestic fossil fuel resources which puts the country in a perilous state of energy insecurity. National economic development is tightly linked to energy prices and availability of imported energy resources. Promotion of renewable energy technologies will also support development of technical skills in this field, create jobs, reducing national carbon footprint while helping nation\u2019s energy security. Therefore, utilization of indigenous renewable energy sources is of utmost importance. The NEEAP proposes stronger support for solar water heaters, distributed solar PV systems and piloting of geothermal heat pumps for building heat. Development of domestic renewable energy sources featured prominently in the the Primary Energy Saving Section of the NEEAP. Similarly, the market for energy efficiency services remains one of the missing links for the private sector players to tap into energy efficiency potential in their businesses. Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) are gradually becoming a new important partner in promoting sustainable energy solutions in Armenia. Their creation has been supported by a number of donor-funded programs. As long has donor support was fully available for grant-funded energy efficiency investments, the ESCOs did not develop financing features, but built up skills for designing energy efficiency projects and implementing implemented the engineering work. As the R2E2 established the lending scheme for public building energy saving investments via energy saving agreements through ESCOs, more than 30 companies are now operating, which provide services such as weatherization, design, installation and maintenance of boiler houses, as well as broader consulting on related issues. While the ESCOs do not function under guaranteed or shared savings contracts, the payments are linked to delivered energy savings and However, they still do not share or guarantee amounts of energy saved neither do they bear direct financial risk. This is why the promotion of ESCOs, as promoters and vendors of energy efficiency, need support. This task is addressed among the cross-cutting/horizontal measures, along with the capacity building needs of other players in initiation, development and financing of energy efficiency in private sector.Overview of initiatives implemented and proposed for the industrial, power and SME sectors are presented in Table 34 with specific measures presented in the subsequent tables. 168 Table 34.

Phase 1 of three main components: (i) expansion of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and energy management system (EMS), (ii) rehabilitation of four existing 220/110-kilovolt (kV) substation, and (iii) support for institutional development, capacity building, and project management. The benefits of avoided equipment breakdown can be quantified in terms of avoided loss of energy, measured in kWh. All four concerned substations are over forty years old and physically and morally obsolete what causes frequent temporary shutdowns. The substations are expected to become fully non- operational shortly and if they are not replaced the total loss of generation is quantified in final feasibility study at 5,474 GWh, what corresponds to more than 80% of total supply in Armenia. The rehabilitation of 4 substations will improve operational efficiency of whole internal transmission network, by reducing the number of unplanned outages (defined as outages above 1 hour) in the 220 kV transmission network by 50%.

Annual Growth of Motor Fuel Consumption by RT, 2000-2013, (in 1,000 tons). Source: GHG Inventory, Transport Sector. Yerevan, October, 2013. The rapid growth of CNG used by road transport in Armenia during the past 14 years is highlighted inFigure 37. During 2000-2013, the CNG consumption increased by about 16 times, from 21 kt in 2000 up to 327 kt in 2013. With an accuracy level of 96.4%, CNG consumption growth for the period of 2000-2013 can be approximate with the linear trend. The accuracy of linear approximation would have been even greater if we had smoothed out the variation caused by the realities of the 2008 crisis. By 2009, consumption of CNG was visibly declining, but returned to the same linear growth in the subsequent years (Figure 37). In 2006, the amounts of gasoline and CNG consumed by RT became equal. Since then, CNG has surpassed the share of gasoline consumption.

The first phase of strategy: In 2005-2006, first 131 new Euro-3 technology standard urban buses were put in operation, replacing 143 old Pre-Euro standard minibuses and several buses. Two new bus routes were introduced, replacing 5 minibuses routes (one canceled and 4 replaced). 2. The second phase of the strategy: Since 2007 and by 2013, the number of minibus public RT fleet was reduced by 1,758 vehicles,of which 1,536 were removed in the 2009-2013 period. In 2009 alone, 836 minibuses were put out of operation, which made that year a formative year for implementing the RT fleet optimization strategy\u2019s second phase. At the same time,the amount of minibuses reduced were replaced by 351 new urban buses, 9 different routes of minibuses were canceled and 20 routes of minibuses were replaced by public bus routes.

The price of imported Russian natural gas will remain in the current low range. 2. Net calorific value of imported Russian natural gas is no less than 8,200 kcall/cub.m. Continuation of current trends in CNG/Diesel (gasoline) proportions for minibus and urban bus fleet and running distance reduction through the optimization of public transport run route-grid. Eurasian customs union impact on car import structure, EE lending financing new car purchases, road improvement impact on fuel efficiency Implementation of the Yerevan public transportation fleet optimization strategy and replacement of minibuses by larger urban buses started in 2005. The main aims of strategy are to: \uf0b7 optimize the public RT route grid and reduce the annual running distance of the fleet \uf0b7 \uf0b7 achieve the overall modernization of the public RT fleet replace minibuses by larger ones First phase of implementation, 2005-2007.The first 131 new Euro-3 technology standard urban buses were put in operation, replacing 143 old Pre-Euro standard minibuses and several buses. Two new bus routes were introduced, replacing 5 minibuses routes (one canceled and 4 replaced). Even this modest start led to significant outcomes. Not only was the unsatisfied demand for public transportation in Yerevan visibly reduced (from 130 to 110 trip/person), but substantial energy savings were recorded, with 315,937 MWh in energy savings in 2007, in comparison with the case of not implementing of RT fleet optimization strategyorreplacing minibuses by larger urban buses. Second phase, 2007-2013. The number of minibus public RT fleet was reduced by 1,758 vehicles, of which 1,536 were removed in the 2009-2013 period. In 2009 alone, 836 minibuses were put out of operation, which made that year a formative year in implementing the RT fleet optimization strategy\u2019s second phase. At the same time, the reduced amount of minibuses were replaced by 351 new urban buses, 9 different routes of minibuses were cancelled and 20 routes of minibuses were replaced by public bas routes. As a result, the total annual average running distance of the Yerevan public minibus fleet was reduced from 161 million km in 2010 to about 101 million km in 2014 (a 62.5% reduction).Energy savings of 389,837 MWh were achieved in 2010, in comparison with the case of not implementing of the RT fleet optimization strategy. In 2014, the energy savings increased to 821,022 MWh. Third phase, 2015-2020 (time period considered under NIEP 2). Energy saving calculations for this phase are based on continuation of the current trends. From 2015 to 2020, another 1,020 minibuses are expected to be pulled from the public RT fleet, while the number of buses will increase with the addition of 468 new Euro 4 and higher technology standard buses. This would ensure 896,852 MWh in energy savings in 2015, in comparison with the case of not implementing of the RT fleet optimization strategyor replacing minibuses by larger urban buses. In 2020, the energy savings are expected to increase to 1,267,202 MWh. The quality of energy savings assessment could be improved if more detailed information on activity data is available. Actual recordings of RT fleet running distances (daily and annual) is of paramount importance. Besides, completeness and accuracy of activity data (including a technical description of the RT fleet, data on specific fuel consumption by type and vehicle technology class (Pre-Euro and Euro standards, etc.) is of great importance, as well. It is also extremely important to ensure consistent and robust data gathering, recording and activation processes in place, and improve the institutional memory. The fuel-switching of road transport is one of the largest shareholders of energy savings in the overall list of considered EE measures. The energy savings here could be even bigger, if over the 2015-2020 period, EEV or Euro-4 and newer technology standard urban CNG buses are introduced to replace old minibuses and Euro-3 and earlier standard urban diesel/gasoline buses. In addition, it should be kept in mind that environmental benefits of switching to CNG (reduction of hazardous emissions) in public transport 200 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT are far more significant (although currently not monetized) than the energy savings, though these benefits are important.

The savings have been assessed based on the avoided car trips have been estimated based on a blended mix of types of cars used by the given passenger group and the seasonality of this transit (summeronly). Significant multiplication effect will be achieved by overall modernization of electric trains fleet (98% of rail road grid in Armenia is electrified) Assumptions Overlaps, Multiplication Effect, Synergy The energy savings from operation of YSY ET are based on prevented car trips to L. Sevan recreation zone each year during the summer periods. The Figure below highlights the obtained results. Fig. V5.1. Energy Savings by Operation of YSY Electric Trains (MWh/year) without and with Modernization in 2017-2020 aimed at increasing YSY ET fuel efficiency. The quality of energy saving assessments could be significantly improved if more detailed information on passenger flow by each routewas available (e.g., Hrazdan-Charentsavan-Yerevan(Almast) and back, separately from Yerevan(Almast)-Sevan-Yerevan(Almast) seasonal route, as well as for regular routes: Yerevan(Central)-Tbilisi(Georgia)-Yerevan(Central),Yerevan(Central)-Gyumri-Yerevan(Central), Yerevan(Central)-Armavir, Yerevan(Central)-Artashat, etc.). If detailsare available about the \u201cConcept Program of Passenger Transportation for 2012-2020\u201d developed by UKZhd, they could be of great help. Another very important portion of the activity data, currently unavailable in sufficient details, is related to the technical description of the stock of electric locomotives (with specific energy consumption information), drive-mode description of routes (average inclination, wasteful break portions of the routes and their distances), etc. It is also extremely important to ensure consistent and robust data gathering, recording and activation mechanisms, and improve the institutional memory. The completeness of energy saving assessments of the considered measure could be essentially improved if more activity data becomes available for analysis. This is especially true in case of current activities of UKZhd CJSC, such as cargo transportation of mining products, seasonal round trips to Batumi (Georgian 206 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Black see coast) from Yerevan Rail Station, Yerevan-Tbilisi (Georgia)-Yerevan and Yerevan-Gyumri- Yerevan round trips across Armenia. As far as the assessment of energy savings from UKZhd planned future activities is concerned, more detailed information about transportation of coal for the Yerevan Thermal Power Plant (announced in 2013) and transportation of municipal solid waste to centralized regional MSW disposal sites (announced in 2014) would be of great importance. The future new passenger turnover projects have significant energy-saving potential. One of the most promising that should be considered is the \u201cAeroExpress\u201d project. According to UKZhd officials, under this project announced in 2012, it is planned to connect Yerevan Central Rail Road Station to the Zvartnots international Airport. 207 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Title Index of the measure Category Continuous switching of road vehicles from gasoline to compressed natural gas (CNG) V.6 Transport Timeframe Continuous activity Aim/Brief Description Switching from Gasoline/diesel fuel to CNG has significant potential to reduce GHG emissions in RA.

Regional stability will be ensured. 2. Harmonization between the European and Eurasian integration processes will be achieved. 3. An attractive business environment for infrastructure loans will be created. Currently, several transport development strategies are in place, lacking overall synchronization of activities and absence of a unified approach. Significant public transport infrastructure development is needed in order to cover the huge unmet demand for public transportation services in the greater Yerevan area. The main focus should be placed on the development of the integrated electro-transport network for the greater Yerevan area with an essential expansion of the Yerevan Metro. 1. Significant development of the public transport infrastructure by introducing an integrated electro- transport network (IETN) for the capital Yerevan with two transport hubs to the Zvartnots International Airport (West Hub) and to the cities of Abovian and Charentsavan (North Hub, based on Almast station in Nor Zeytun district of Yerevan, see V3 Report). \uf0b7 First phase.By 2025, a 7-station new metro line with West HUB connecting metro with the Zvartnots International Airport will be put into operation, which will double the metro annual turnover. \uf0b7 Second phase. In 2030, commissioning of ITEN new 9-station metro line with North HUB (to the cities of Abovian and Charentsavan, on the base of the Almast Rail station). ITEN turnover will more than triple in comparison with the 2010 level. Annual electricity consumption will increase from the current 120 million kWh level to 375-400 million kWh in 2030. \uf0b7 Energy savingsachieved from the implementation of this measure will be at least 3 times more than the savings from the V3 measure and will mainly occur after 2020. More detailed estimates should be made through a properly conducted analysis based on consistent and adequate primary data. 2. Encouraging import of gas-fired public transportation vehicles, electromobiles and hybrid cars (via duty and tax incentives). 3. Modernizing the electro-transport fleet; introducing modern Unified Ticket for Public Transport (including electro-transport, trolleybuses, metro, electric rail and urban busses) 4. Development of the related infrastructure (services, operation and maintenance). 5. Attracting direct investments and technology transfer, introducing private-public partnership mechanisms and establishing effective collaboration with local authorities are essential to accomplishing the strategic goals. 6. Developing the appropriate roadmap and action plan is crucial to the successful implementation of this measure. Others components include: advertising of public transport use, promotion of the \u201csustainable green transport for cities\u201d concept, introducing a modern ticketing system, including monetization of gains from increasing the sustainability of the transport sector and its level of independence from fuel imports. It is hoped that the development of the ITEN in Armenia\u2019scapital city will essentially help tap the significant potential of public transport services and bring the use of services to the 1989 level (185 trips per person annually) by 2030. 211 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT COMPETENT BODIES AND ASSIGNED ORGANIZATIONS Energy efficiency policy has a pivotal role to play in Armenia\u2019s economy: It is essential for creating conditions for economic growth while improving energy security. By reducing the energy intensity of the national economic output, energy efficiency holds the key to maintaining a safe, sustainable and affordable energy supply, while meeting increasing energy demand and improving quality of life for the Armenian population. Under conditions of extreme import dependence for fossil fuels, energy that Armenia\u2019s citizens, businesses, and infrastructure do not use is the cheapest, cleanest, and most secure energy resource. The potential for energy efficiency in all sectors has been assessed repeatedly and remains high, despite the relatively low energy intensity of the economy. The Armenian Government has promoted energy efficiency through various programs and policies, but the overall potential for efficiency improvement still remains largely untapped. With energy prices rising, the urgency of accelerating the uptake of energy efficiency throughout Armenia\u2019s economy has increased. The goal of the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) is to assess the effectiveness of ongoing efforts by the Government, donors, international financial institutions and the private sector to improve the efficiency of energy use since 2010, when Armenia\u2019s first NEEAP was developed. The second NEEAP also identifies barriers to more extensive efforts in this direction, proposes measures to help overcome these barriers, and offers additional energy efficiency improvement measures for the period covering 2015\u20132020. The key pillars of the second NEEAP are: \uf0b7 Reducing energy demand by improving the efficiency of energy end use; \uf0b7 Improving national energy security by reducing the need for imported energy resources; \uf0b7 Decreasing the energy content of the key economic outputs to reduce costs and raise the competitiveness of output; \uf0b7 Addressing growing energy affordability concerns through energy efficiency solutions (instead of relying on social aid); and \uf0b7 Providing impetus for behavioral change by decoupling growth from energy use, and thus enhancing the quality and sustainability of development through the introduction of knowledge and traditions for resource efficiency and smart growth. The development and adoption of the Second NEEAP for the Republic of Armenia is one of the steps on the pathway upon which the Government of Armenia embarked a decade ago, by adopting Armenia\u2019s first Law on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy. The 212 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT Republic of Armenia developed its first NEEAP in 2010 to accelerate the implementation of its national energy efficiency policy. The first NEEAP set forth a set of programmatic and policy measures for energy efficiency improvement for all economic sectors of the country. The first NEEAP, adopted by Government Resolution #43 on 4 November 2010, set the country on track for a ten-year process with intermediate targets and interim evaluations. Because adequate data were not available at the time for developing targets based on statistics, the first NEEAP provided rough estimates of the potential impact of the proposed measures as fractions of the overall target up to 2020. The successful implementation of the energy policy of the Republic of Armenia depends on the active engagement of all stakeholders in the sector. The realization of the secon NEEAP is a necessity. All planned measures should be implemented to achieve the anticipated results. None of them has a low priority, all individually and as a whole are necessary. The application of EE measures reduces dependence on imports of primary and transformed energy, decreases environmental pollution, improving the living conditions of citizens (less pollution, better health conditions, lower energy costs), create new jobs. While the Table 39 summarises the roles and responsibilities of the key stakeholders with respective investments necessary for each of the EE improvement measure, the role of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MoENR) must be additionally emphasized. The existing organizational structure in the field of energy efficiency policy has been a priority measure in the first NEEAP and the NEEAP proposed establishment of an Energy Efficiency Agency. This activity was not implemented. De facto, R2E2 has been tasked with many functions of an EE Agency. The R2E2 is well positioned for this role, but the administrative capacities within MoENR are scarce with very limited capacity and cadre for the implementation of the national policy of energy efficiency. This situation of understaffed bodies responsible for the overall implementation and monitoring of energy efficiency policy can cause delays in the execution of the obligations. These capacities are also necessary to adequately pursue the legal-regulatory reform tasks and promotion 213 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT of the policy initiatives with the legislative bodies. Failure to do so will cause further delays in implementation of amendments of energy efficiency policy. The competent bodies and assigned organizations are Development Department at the Ministry of Economy, R2E2 and the National Statistical Service. The Ministry of Economy, oversees the entire industry and SME sector and is currently in charge of all energy efficiency-related issues related to standards and certification. The Ministry of Agriculture must be in charge of programs related to irrigation, aquaculture, and greenhouses. The Ministry of Urban Development (MUD) must continue to take the lead in housing poicy reform. MUD is also strongly understaffed. According to international best practices, when initiating reform, establishing a National Housing Agency could help speed up the process creating a viable financing scheme for MABs with the enrollment or the private sector. The main tasks to be adopted by the MoENR or R2E2 related to the second NEEAP are the following: \u203a Develop and maintain appropriate and transparent data bases on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources (monitoring and reporting services). \u203a Monitoring, verification of savings and preparing reports on realized energy audits in building sector. \u203a Organize and monitor training courses for energy auditors. \u203a Cooperate with non-governmental sector in developing the awareness of the need of EE and RES. \u203a Encourage innovative approaches for investment including third party financing or co- financing. \u203a Undertake measures for raising the awareness of consumers on end-use heat efficiency and increasing the efficiency of MABs, insulation, efficiency of pumps, flow regulation and other distribution efficiencies can occur. The National Statistical Service, in turn, must receive a permanent mandate for the debelopment and maintenance of the national energy balance on annual basis. As an important step, the Government should establish a Watch Group \u2013Committee (WG) to draw on private sector and community expertise during the implementing NEEAP and EE Strategy. WG an interagency group of experts from key stakeholders in the government, academia, public/non-governmental and private sectors, consumer groups, etc. will be established as a formal committee, adjascent to the Government, to convene on regular basis and discuss the direction and effectiveness of reform in energy efficiency and recommend actions, thus building a consensus among disparate energy efficiency 214 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT stakeholders, while providing a platform for public discussion and lobbying of new legal initiatives. It can provide information to Government on lessons learned and best practice in implementing energy efficiency strategies which will underpin the long-term success of the Strategy. An organization such as this has proven to be critical to the success of other governmental energy efficiency programs. Main tasks of the WG will be: \u203a Oversee existing and proposed Government funds and Grants . \u203a Engage stakeholders to enhance the effectiveness of existing and proposed funds and incentives (e.g. work with banking and property industry to increase awareness). \u203a Support national and sector specific information campaigns to increase awareness of energy efficiency options. \u203a Suggest, coordinate and enhance energy data collection. \u203a Report annually to Parliament on the effectiveness of all policies and measures and make recommendations for improvements. \u203a Engage with state and local authorities to encourage coordination, consolidation and \u203a collaboration of programs and policies. Lead a national program to stimulate EE skills, knowledge and work needed for a sustainable economy development. The Board of Trustees of R2E2 is well positioned to perform these above roles. Awareness and education of the stakeholders. Continuous consumer information is an important measure assumed before and during the implementation of NEEAP. Through it promote benefits for the application of EE measures. It envisage realization of education at all levels vertically, creating new working places and businesses and acquire new skills that are missing from the market by way of qualification which solves the problem of unemployment; mitigated problem outflow of educated people. Crucial element for the realization of the envisaged action plan is providing the necessary funding. The efficient functioning of the NEEAP is of very high importance for the implementation of the state policy in the sector of energy efficiency. The political decision through legal benchmark for compulsory implementation of energy efficiency measures in public buildings, paved the way to a successful implementation of the measures envisaged. Incentive instruments for the implementation of EE measures are extraordinary impulse to potential investors. The measure of financial incentives for installing solar panels should 215 Second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Armenia Armenia Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund FIRST DRAFT not remain single. Positive results have been achieved during participation in the cost of refurbishment of private housing by municipalities and donors (HABITAT / USAID). The state needs to provide funds for financial assistance to industry, manufacturing and services in order to become more market competitive by the cheaper products, while simultaneously increasing quality, due to lower energy costs by adopting new technological processes. Donors\u2019 assistance in this direction is valuable, but should not be the only one in providing technical assistance on best available technologies, subsidizing energy audits and facilitating finance through commercial banks .
