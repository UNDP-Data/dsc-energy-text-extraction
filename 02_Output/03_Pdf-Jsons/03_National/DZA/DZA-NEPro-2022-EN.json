The bar chart shows the proportion of a country's land area in each of these classes and the global distribution of land area across the classes (for comparison). Onshore wind: Potential wind power density (W/m2) is shown in the seven classes used by NREL, measured at a height of 100m. The bar chart shows the distribution of the country's land area in each of these classes compared to the global distribution of wind resources. Areas in the third class or above are considered to be a good wind resource. Biomass: Net primary production (NPP) is the amount of carbon fixed by plants and accumulated as biomass each year. It is a basic measure of biomass productivity. The chart shows the average NPP in the country (tC/ha/yr), compared to the global average NPP of 3-4 tonnes of carbon Sources: IRENA statistics, plus data from the following sources: UN SDG Database (original sources: WHO; World Bank; IEA; IRENA; and UNSD); UN World Population Prospects; UNSD Energy Balances; UN COMTRADE; World Bank World Development Indicators; EDGAR; REN21 Global Status Report; IEA -IRENA Joint Policies and Measures Database; IRENA Global Atlas; and World Bank Global Solar Atlas and Global Wind Atlas. Additional notes: Capacity per capita and public investments SDGs only apply to developing areas. Energy self-sufficiency has been defined as total primary energy production divided by total primary energy supply. Energy trade includes all commodities in Chapter 27 of the Harmonised System (HS). Capacity utilisation is calculated as annual generation divided by year-end capacity x 8,760h/year. Avoided emissions from renewable power is calculated as renewable generation divided by fossil fuel generation multiplied by reported emissions from the power sector. This assumes that, if renewable power did not exist, fossil fuels would be used in its place to generate the same amount of power and using the same mix of fossil fuels. In countries and years where no fossil fuel generation occurs, an average fossil fuel emission factor has been used to calculate the avoided emissions. These profiles have been produced to provide an overview of developments in renewable energy in different countries and areas.
