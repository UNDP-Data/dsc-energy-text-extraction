One of the requests of the law 138/2013 \u201cOn Renewable Energy Resources\u201d and of this Directive is \nthe preparation and the approval of the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (NREAP), which establishes \nnational objectives of renewable energies in the final total domestic consumption as well as the supporting measures \nto achieve them.\nAlso, Albanian Government considers the promotion of renewable energies implementation as an important means \nof energy policies to increase the security for energy supply, economic development, energy sector sustainability and \nenvironment protection. \nEven though Albania ensures over 90% of the power from the hydropower stations, a considerable part of the \nenergy is imported. This part varies \u2013 depending on the annual conditions- between 30% and 60%^ of the Total \nSupply with Prime Energy. Renewable energies might be a solution for the reduction of this dependence from the \nimports and it might improve not only the security for the supply with energy, but even the macroeconomic and \npolitical security of the country decreasing the country budget deficit.\nBased on these facts, which offer the context for potential increase of the EREs role in the current situation of \nenergy and economy in Albania, and based upon the principles of energy and the added domestic economic value, \nthe potential objectives of EREs policies have been passed: \nI. Consumption of renewable energy resources at the measure of 38% in 2020; \nII. Desertification of domestic renewable resources, not only from the water resources but even from wind, \nsun, biomass and geothermal energy; the use of domestic energy resources, especially in the remote areas \nproviding vacancies and improving the living standards. \nIII. The increase of the contribution of bio-fuels and other burning materials from renewable resources with \n10% in the total of fuel consumption in transport sector until 2020. \nThe increase of the use of EREs technologies is an essential step in general towards a more sustainable society and \nin particular it brings considerable benefits for Albanian industry. \nERE\u2019s 38% objective was passed in the Decision of the Council of Ministers of Energy Community 2012/04/MC\u0002EnC. \nGeneral National Objective\nThe year 2009 will be the starting point in the National Objective for ERE. In this year the EGFC was 2,104 ktoe \nand ERE percentage in consumption terms was 31.2%. Implementing the approach determined in the Directive, \npursuant to technologies, the basic data are provided for ERE promotion. \nRenewable energy for ERE-T transport sector: In order for the ERE consumption National Objective of 38% \nto be accomplished in 2020, the consumption of 3% for the Albanian territory of EGFC has been predicted. \nOtherwise, the mixture up to the measure of 10% in the volume of fuels of the renewable burning materials \n(FAME), consumed in the Transport sector, has been predicted. This amount is equal with at least 75 ktoe FAME \nfor the transport sector in 2020. This amount of the renewable part in biofuels takes into consideration the increase \nwith 60 ktoe in 2020 compared to 2014.\nRenewable energy for heating and cooling sector ERE-H&C: in order for the ERE consumption National \nObjective of 38% to be accomplished in 2020, it is necessary that the consumption of 10% of EGFC in the \nAlbanian territory, which has to be consumed in the Heating and Cooling system, ERE-H&C, is consumed. This \namount means an additional increase of the heat with at least 800 GWh/year in 2020 or an annual consumption of \nERE-H&C of 2/9 ktoe heat from wood/industrial/waste and heating pumps biomass. \nRenewable energy for energy sector, ERE-E: In order for ERE consumption National Objective of 38% in \n2020, it is necessary that the amount of 29% of EGFC, used in energy sector, ERE-E, in the Albanian territory is \nconsumed. This amount means an additional increase of at least 270 ktoe (3,140 GWh) until 2020. Also, this means \nan average increase of energy generators from renewable resources in the amount of 830 MW (20-35% capacity \nfactor) which are proposed to be divided according to the summarizing table:Consumption in Albania after 2015 until 2020. \nERE additional technology 2015-2020\n\n1. RES ACTUAL SITUATION IN ALBANIA\n1.1 Introduction and historic overview\nThe supply with prime energy in Albania has been dominated by fuel, hydropower plants and biomass. \nDomestic energy sector has been supported by energy imports, especially by fuel products and energy \nimports. Historically, energy needs have been accomplished almost exclusively by the hydropower plants. \nThe total installed energy capacity in Albania reaches up to 1.8 GW, dominated by hydropower plants. \nWater resources are the most important natural resources in Albania and the general hydropower \npotential is assessed up to 4.500 MW. Today, the country has exploited only 35% of the hydropower \nstations potential. The hydropower stations established and linked on the cascade on the river Drin \nrepresent about 80% of the total energy production. \nThe changes in power production might be attributed to the unstable production from the hydropower \nplants. Furthermore, the country suffers from significant transmission and delivery losses \u2013 which are \ntechnical and non-technical \u2013 which were assessed up to 44.96% in 2012, according to ERE, and due to \nthe tough and active measures undertaken by the Albanian Government, they fell up to 29% in the first \nsix months of 2015. \nAs the water conditions change year after year, the country is compelled to support on energy export at a \nlarge measure. The increasing requests for energy have increased even the support of Albania in energy \nimport. Especially, during the first decade (2001-2010), energy final request increased with an annual \naverage norm of 4.8%. On the other side, energy generating capacity increased by an annual norm of \n0.6%. The country has changed from an energy exporter into an importer. For this reason, the generating \ncapacity extension is one of the main priorities of energy policies sector in Albania. The future \ndevelopment of energy capacity has been planned mainly along the rivers Mat, Vjosa, Devoll and Bistrica. \nApart from this, the Albanian government has been focused on the diversification of its supply with \nenergy and the promotion of other renewable energy resources, such as biomass, solar energy and wind \nenergy. \nAlbania has a considerable potential of RER. Its solar power potential has been assessed in 1,500-1,700 \nkWh/m2 per year. The country has also unexploited potentials of wind power, especially along the \nAdriatic coastline. According to the Albanian Agency of Investment Developments a series of zones have \nbeen identified with high potential of wind energy, with an average annual wind speed of 6-8 m/s and \nwith energy density of 250-600 W/m2. Albania has also considerable potential of biomass from \nagricultural waste, which is assessed approximately about 2,300 GWh/year. The heat from renewable \nresources, which is being offered from the inefficient use of firewood, is promoted mainly through the \nimplementation of solar systems for water heating, industrial biomass and agricultural biomass. As long as \nenergy production system is concerned, despite the hydropower stations, which is the main RES \ntechnology, it is expected to expand considerably up to the year 2020. The other RES technologies such \nas wind, biomass ore solar power are expected to play a limited role, even though considerable potential \nexists.\nThe developments in energy final consumption indicate the domination of fuel products. From 1990 up \nto 2013, a considerable decrease might be noticed in the contribution of solid combustibles, that means \ncoal and natural gas. In 2013, transport sector was the greatest energy consumer, with about 40% of the \nfinal total consumption, followed by the residential sector (27%), industry (17%), service sector (9%) and \nat the end agriculture (5%). \nAlbania as one of the Contractual Parties of Energy Community Treaty is compelled to transpose and to \nbe in compliance with the EU Directive 2009/28/EC \u201cOn the enhancement of energy use from \nrenewable resources and it must amend and then abrogate Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC\u201d. \nThis comes even as a request of Law 138/2013 \u201cOn Energy Renewable Resources\u201d. One of the requests \nof law and of this Directive is the preparation and the approval of the National Action Plan for \nRenewable Energy (NREAP), which would stipulate the national objectives on renewable energies in the [7]\nfinal consumption of domestic energy. On the other hand, Albanian government has considered the \npromotion of renewable energy use as an important tool of energy policies for the increase of the security \nfor energy supply, economic development, energy sector sustainability and environment protection. Even \nthough, in Albania, more than 95% of energy and 20-23% of primary total resources have been provided \nby hydropower stations, the objectives of Albanian Government energy policy intend to increase further \nmore the use of RER. \nIn the last decade all over the world, the greatest part of the debate in relation to the encouragement for \nthe implementation of renewable resources has been focused on the financial support schemes and the \nimprovement of the conditions in network connection for renewable energy. There is no doubt that these \nare the main issues which continue to remain in the centre of the policy-makers\u2019 attention today and in \nthe future. \nAlbania is a special case because domestic energy production is realized mostly by the use of big and \nmedium hydropower plants. Also, about 10-13% of the Total Energy Primary Resources (TEPR) in the \ncountry \u2013 including the imports \u2013 is ensured by biomass, and especially from the firewood. \nOn the other hand, Albania carries out important imports of energy which according to the annual \nconditions, change from 30-60% of the TEPR. Renewable energy might t be the solution for the decrease \nof this strategic dependence on the imports and the improvement not only of the security for energy \nsupply but even of the macroeconomic and political security of the country decreasing the domestic \nbudget deficit. \nBased on these facts which offer the context for the potential increase of the role of RES in the current \nenergy and economy condition in Albania, based even on the energy security principles and on the added \ndomestic economic value, the potential objectives of RES policies have been approved. The increase of \nthe use of technologies RESis a step of special importance in general towards a more sustainable society \nand in particular it brings considerable benefits for Albanian industry. The argument of added value in \ndomestic economy shall be used in the decision-making process for the new supporting schemes towards \nRES. The support of RES installations might offer an opportunity of importance for the development of \nlocal areas which are relatively poor. \n1.2 OFFER and DEMAND for energy\nBased on Energy National Balance 2009, where the general net consumption of the primary energy \nresources is 2100.93 ktoe, where just 449.82 was produced ny the hydropower stations, 210 ktoe is the \ncontribution from biomass, solar power is 6.65 ktoe and in total all the RES are 666.47 ktoe (equal to \n31.2% of energy final consumption in 2009). Meanwhile, according to the last energy balance for Albania \nissued by the Natural Resources National Centre (NRNC) in 2013, from a general net consumption of \nenergy primary resources of 2345.90 ktoe, just 592.72 ktoe are from the hydropower plants, biomass \ncontribution is 201.50 ktoe, solar power is 11,92 ktoe, non fuels 35 ktoe, and in total all the RES are equal \nto 846.63 (equal to 33.20% of energy gross final consumption in 2013). \nHistorically, Albania has gone through a high abnormal increase of energy consumption. A considerable \npart of this increase has been encouraged artificially by the extraordinary levels of energy theft, the failure \nto pay the energy bills and in some cases by the tariffs under cost. The high consumption of energy in the \nsector of buildings, especially to heat the buildings, has caused that a valuable resource is removed by the \ntrade and industrial use which otherwise would create vacancies and would contribute in the economic \ngrowth. The measure taken by the Albanian Government recently for the prevention of energy non\u0002payment (reduced from 52% in 2013 to about 29,8% for the first six months of 2015) have removed one \nof the main obstacles for the introduction of RES and the energy efficient measures for both sides of \nAlbanian energy system: the request and the supply. \n2. OBJECTIVE FOR RES IN ALBANIA\n2.1 National Objective for RES[8]\nThe main intention of the new EU Directive for renewable energy (Directive 2009/28) is the \ndetermination of mandatory objectives for the use of energy for renewable resources. The Directive \nstipulates a general objective of 20% for EU and individual objectives for the Member States based on \ntheir current renewable energy level and their economic development level. Within the general objective \nfor RES, there is a specific obligation that 10% of the energy that is used in the transport sector is \nprovided from the renewable resources. \nThe same approach, but with another base year (2009 instead of 2005) has been applied to calculate the \nindividual objectives of each Contractual Party in Energy Community, exactly for Albania, there is an \nObjective of 38% and the specific obligation within this Objective to fulfill 10% of the energy used in \ntransport by renewable resources. \nThe objective of 38% from RES has been adopted in the Decision of the Council of Ministers \n2012/04/MC-EnC, when the Directive of RES was approved for the Energy Community. \nIn table 1 below, there are all the predicted figures of the final energy gross consumption of all the kinds \nof energy (from both the renewable as well as the conventional resources), in the period until 2020. These \ncalculations have taken into consideration even the expected effects of the measures for energy efficiency \nand saving which will be introduced over the period. Under the title \u201creference scenario\u201d, a scenario has \nbeen introduced taking into consideration only the measures of the efficiency of energy and savings. It is \nvery important to emphasize the fact that as it was mentioned above, these savings have been almost \ninconsiderable, as the RENAP was passed officially in September 2011. Under the title \u201cAdditional \nScenario for Energy Efficiency\u201d, a scenario has been introduced taking into consideration all the \nmeasures that will be undertaken in order to achieve the RENAP objective of 9% in 2018. Pursuant to \narticle 5 (6) of the Directive 2009/28/EC, with the intention to measure the compatibility with the \nindicative objective 2020 and the temporary trajectory, the amount of energy consumed in aviation must \nbe considered not to be higher than 6,18% of the general consumption of the Contractual Party energy. \nEnergy consumption in aviation for Albania during 2009 and 2010 was 0.97% and 1.07% respectively of \nthe general consumption of final gross energy. Therefore, there is no need for regulation as these values \nare lower than 6.18% (in continuation table 1). [9]\nthe national \nbalance.\n\n1\nIs the final energy consumption for all the energy commodities apart from power for other purposes apart from transport, (EU/OJ L304 of 14.11.2008)\n2 Energy gross consumption is taken from the internal gross production of energy, including autoproduction, plus the import, minus the export..\n3 Consumption in transport is provided for in Article 3(4)a) of the Directive 2009/28/EC. Energy from RERs in road transport for this parametre shall be multiplied with the factor 2,5 as it is described in Article 3(4)c) \nof the Directive 2009/28/EC\n4 According to the provision in Article (2)f of the Directive 2009/28/EC. It inscludes the final consumption of energy plus the losses in the network and the use of heat for internal needs and energy in energy and heat \nproduction plants. \n5 These predictions on energy efficiency and the savings of energy in compliance with the RENAP. [10]\n2. NREAP-THE FULFILLMENTS OF THE OBJECTIVES ON RES\n2.1 Summary of the policy for renewable energy in Albania \nIn the recent years, the Albanian Government has been trying to improve the legal and the \nregulatory framework for energy. In this direction, it made several attempts to change the \nexisting laws and to encourage a competing climate for energy productions in general and the \nRES in particular. Along with a series of legal improvements, four key laws have been passed: \nthe law for concessions, for energy sector (passed by the Parliament of Albania in May 2015), for \nrenewable energy (passed by the Parliament of Albania in May 2015, but is being reviewed and is \ngoing to be ready for approval at the end of 2015), for the efficiency of energy in the buildings \n(the draft law was passed the previous year. It was prepared in line with the EU Directive). The \npurpose of these laws is the liberalization of energy market, competition increase, \nencouragement of renewable resources development and the attraction of the foreign \ninvestments in energy sector and ensuring a sustainable reform in the field of energy. With \nregard to the development of the projects for renewable energy, the licensing process has been \nimproved. The establishment of one-stop-shop office for the licenses is a big step ahead made by \nthe Albanian Government from 2009. However, with regard to its functioning, it needs further \nimprovements. \n2.2 Indicating objectives for renewable energy\nPursuant to article 4 (1) of the Directive 2009/28/EC, the Contractual Parties in the EC Treaty \nwere asked to have the following indicating objectives with regard to the part of the energy with \nrenewable resources in 2020: \n\uf0b7 Heating and cooling; \n\uf0b7 Energy, and \n\uf0b7 Transport. \nThe calculation of specific objectives of these three sectors converted in the predicts energy \nvalues (ktoe) must be at least as big as the energy amount expected from renewable resources \nwhich correspond with the general objective of RES for Albania in 2020, as it is reported in the \nfinal cell of the table 6b). Furthermore, the specific objective for transport shall be in compliance \nwith the requests of article 3 (4) of the Directive 2009/28/EC for a level of 10% of the part \ncovered by renewable energies in transport sector. From oil products, only diesel and diesel fuel \nare calculated for the nominator. This means that \u201cJet\u201d fuel used in aviation as well as the fuel \nused for the ships is not calculated. Biofuels from the rubbish, the waste, cellulose non-food \nmaterial and the lignocellulose material are calculated double regarding the nominator; General \nNational Objective for energy from renewable resources in the final energy gross production in \n2009 and 2020 (data taken from Appendix 1, Part A of Directive 2009/28/EC) has been \npresented in Table 2. \n\n3. MEASURES FOR THE FULFILMENT OF SPECIFIC\nOBJECTIVES IN EACH SECTOR\n3.1 Summary of the policies and of the measures for the enhancement to use \nenergy from renewable resources\nAlbania has undertaken a series of steps for the inclusion of in its policies for energy, the \nrequests of the EU Directives about the common rules for the creation and the \ndevelopment of internal energy market and the enhancement of production and energy \nconsumption from renewable resources. In order for Albania to fulfill its international \nobligations and to achieve pursuant to the legal obligation the objective of 38% renewable \nenergy in the final gross consumption until 2020, the country is undertaking a review of its \nsupporting tools for renewable energy production. The scheme described in the following \nparagraphs will permit Albania to follow its objectives of RES and more concretely \npreserving and increasing the security in supply including a variety of RES generation \ntechnologies. \n3.1.1 Current supporting schemes for energy production from Renewable Resources .\nAt the moment there is a promoting tariff just for the small HPPs with installed power less \nthan 15 MW and the tariff is calculated according to the average annual price of energy at \nEnergy Stock market in Hungary (HUPX) determined in Euro cent/kWh x 1.24 x average \nexchange rate Euro/Lek for the previous year. This approach has been based on a simple \nformula and furthermore takes into consideration the price of energy import and connects \nit with the tariff to avoid the costs against the customer. The abovementioned formula, \npursuant to the Decision of the Council of Ministers, shall be for 2015-2016 for the \nexisting HPPs. \nThe new system of promoting tariff shall be presented through the adaptation of the new \nlaw for RES, which is being prepared, taking into consideration that the level of the tariffs \nshall take into consideration the type the technology and the efficiency of the generating \nequipments. Also, the new law for RES shall offer other stimuli, such as: \n\uf0b7 The determination of a national objective for RES in the total of the final energy \nconsumption; \n\uf0b7 The obligation of the transmission or distribution companies to connect new \nplants of RESin their networks; the payment only of the direct costs of the \nconnection in the transmission networks and of energy distribution; \n\uf0b7 Recognition of the existing agreements for the purchase of energy produced from\nRESand the obligation of the Operator to buy energy produces from small HPPs. \nAs a result of these measures the interest on renewable resources has increase considerably,\nparticularly on small hydropower stations as the \u201cmost\u201d traditional technology that is best \nknown. \nThe thermal system of solar panels for hot water preparation has gone through a \nconsiderable development. The current law provides facilitating measures in the tax system \nfor these panels. [14]\n3.1.2 Supporting promoting schemes of RES in energy market.\nThe state support is intended to be restructured for renewable energies and to replace the \nscheme of the feed-in tariff with a system based on Contracts for the difference (CfD). \nAnyway, in the legislation that is being amended, the feed-in tariff scheme is expected to \nremain into force to support the renewable energy in a small scale up to the capacity 2 MW \ninstalled for generating units. \nThe renewable energy producers, at the moment with energy-purchase agreements \nfinalized before the law which is being amended will enter into force, will have a fixed \nfeed-in tariff for the remaining part of the contact. This situation does not exclude the \nright of these producers to move to a Supporting Scheme Contract for Difference. \nBased upon law 43/2015 \u201cOn energy sector\u201d, the new model of energy market is being \ndrafted, providing for the trading of energy from the renewable sources, to the advanced \nmarket when the Albanian Energy Stock market is established. \nThe legal criteria of RES generation shall be established by ERE. Only the generation that \nfulfils the legal conditions might be supported pursuant to a CfD. The renewable \ntechnologies that will be acceptable for support according to the scheme CfD are listed in \nthe following paragraph: \n- Biomass transformation\n- Wind in terrestrial boundaries\n- Solar photovoltaics \n- Hydroenergy \n- Energy from the waste through CHP\n- Gas from landfills \n- Gas from the dirty urban water sanitation \nThe Ministry shall review the list every year and might propose a change to the list at the \nCouncil of Ministers in case another technology is considered consolidated. \nAlso, the legal changes will provide for the drafting of the Methodologies for the \ndetermination of standard prices which will be calculated in such a way that they will \nsupport the production of considerable renewable energy, economically acceptable from \nthe market. \n3.2 Supporting schemes for the promotion of energy use from renewable \nresources of heating and cooling (RER-H&C).\nThe government is being planned to introduce some supporting schemes for the use of \nrenewable energies for heating and cooling. The government is reviewing the law on RES\nto add a provision that would finance the projects for heating and cooling, which use \nmainly biomass in the sector of agriculture. The financing is expected to be made through \nthe grants from the RESfund set up by the government. The grants will reach up to 30% \nof the total cost of project investment. Ministry of Energy and Industry in corporation \nwith the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Water Administration will \nidentify the most suitable projects based on their financial realization and the influence to \nfulfill the objective of RESin the sector of agriculture. \n [15]\n3.3 Supporting schemes for the promotion of the use of energy from renewable \nresources in transport (RER-T)\nLaw no. 9876, dated 14.2.2008 \u201cOn the use, transportation and trading of bio-fuels and \nother renewable combustibles for transport\u201d, article 8 (4), provides that from 2010, the \nminimal annual amount of bio-fuels and other renewable combustibles which are used for \ntransport shall not be less than 3% of the total of the combustibles traded in the market, \nmeanwhile from 2015-ongoing, it won\u2019t be less than 10%. \nThe new draft law on biofuels will have the same objective of 10% to comply with the EU \nDirective 2009/28/EC. The legislation does not contain any specific objectives about the \ndifferent kinds of technology. \nBased upon point 2 article 8 law no. 9876, dated 14.2.2008 \u201cOn the production, transport \nand trading of biofuels and other renewable combustibles for transport\u201d, the Council of \nMinisters, with the proposal of the minister in charge of the transport sector and the \nminister in charge for the sector of hydrocarbon/energy determines the minimal annual \namount of bio-fuels and other renewable combustibles that shall be used in the following \nyear in transport. However, this determination has not been made by any ministers from \nthe moment the law entered into force. \nThe obligation mentioned above has been determined for the whole companies of fuel \nproducts, which have a trading license. \nThe law does not provide for sanctions or punishing measures for non-accomplishing the \nobjective. However, the people who go through this obligation, licensed by the Ministry of \nEnergy and Industry might be punished by this institution for noncompliance with the \nrequirements of the primary and secondary legislation into force which regulates the \nactivities for renewable combustibles used for transport purposes. \nFurthermore, the same law provides for fining for the retail tradesmen of fuel products \nwho do not publish in a visible place in the places/points where they sell a note that \nindicates bio-fuels of other renewable combustibles as well as oil or diesel, mixed with bio\u0002dieseline and bio-ethanol in the measure of 5%. \nNo mechanism has been established for the supervision of the accomplishment of the \nobjective. Ehen though the law for bio-fuels does not express this, the Technical and \nIndustrial State Inspectorate, which is responsible for market surveillance of oil products, \nhas the authority to supervise the accomplishment of the objectives provided for by law. \nFinancial support might be classified in different ways. Such examples are: financial \nsupport for investment, capital grants, loans with low interest, the exclusion from the taxes \nor their reduction, tax reimbursement, tendering schemes, obligations for renewable tariffs \nwith or without green certificates (tradable green certificates), promoting tariffs (feed in), \npromoting rewards, voluntary schemes. \nFinancial support for bio-fuels used for transport is provided through the exclusion from \nthe taxes. Pursuant to article 10 of law on bio fuels, from the period when the law enters \ninto force and until 2018, the excise tax for these products will be zero. [16]\nApart from this, the law has another exception which was into force in 2012, the exclusion \nfrom the customs taxes and the VAT for all the machineries and the necessary equipments \nand the parts of the used objects for the production of bio-fuels and other renewable \ncombustibles, include, but are not limited only with: \n- The equipments and the machineries which changer the organic fertilizer into \norganic improver of the soil, which might be used for the cultivation of the plants \nfor energy purpose; \n- The equipments, materials and the agricultural machineries which will be used by \nthe local farmers for plant cultivation for energy purposes; \n- The equipments and the main and assistant technological machineries of the bio\u0002fuel production plants and of the other renewable combustibles are excluded from \nthe customs taxes and from the VAT for the first period until the end of 2012. \nThe executive bodies of this scheme are the Ministry of Energy and Industry and the \nMinistry of Finances along with the General Directorate of Taxes and the General \nCustoms Directorate. \nNo assessment has been made about the expected influences related to energy production. \nHowever, last year a plant was implemented for bio-fuel production in the industrial area \nof Porto Romano in Durres with the production capacity of about 100 000 ton per year. \nThe tax decrease is not conditioned from any criteria about energy efficiency. \nThis is a supportive measure implemented since 2008. The legal basis of this measure is \nlaw no. 9876, dated 14.2.2008 \u201cOn the production, transportation and the trading of bio\u0002fuels and other renewable combustibles for transport\u201d. The supporting scheme has been \nfunctional since 2008. \nThe starting date of exclusion from the taxes (VAT and the customs taxes) for the \nequipments and the farmers\u2019 machineries which produce the raw material for bio-fuel \nproduction and which are used for the construction of bio-fuel production plant was 14th\nMarch 2008, meanwhile the last date was 31st December 2012. \nThe starting date from the excise exception regarding the produced bio-fuels was 14th\nMarch 2008, meanwhile the last date is 31st December 2018. No maximal or minimal \nsystem measurement has been determined for the producers of bio-fuels who benefit from \nthe tax exclusion as it is provided for by law. At the moment, only one supporting measure \nis applied in Albania for the producers of bio-fuels: the one of the exclusion from the \ntaxes. No local or regional scheme is applied for bio-fuels in Albania. \nThe scheme offers the tax exclusion (VAT and the customs taxes) for the machineries and \nthe equipments which are used for the construction of a plant for bio-fuel production. \nAnybody benefits from this scheme as long as he receives a permission for the \nconstruction of a plant for bio-fuels production. The scheme does not include \nspecifications related to the technology implemented for bio-fuels production to benefit \nfrom this scheme. VAT is reimbursed pursuant to the procedures provided for in law for \nVAT, meanwhile that the exclusion from the customs taxes is applied in the moment the \nmachineries and the equipments enter the Albanian boundary. As it was mentioned above, \neven though the law stipulates that the Council of Ministers after the joint proposal for \nenergy and the minister in charge of transport, determines the minimal objective [17]\n(percentage) of bio-fuels which will be used within e year in the sector of transport, no \nsuch an obligation has been determined. As it was mentioned above, the law does not \nmake distinctions about the support based on the fuel and technology types. No specific \nsupport for bio-fuels, which fulfill the criteria of article 21 (2) of the Directive \n2009/28/EC, has been provided. \n \n3.3.1 Specific measures for the promotion of the exploitation of energy from \nbiomass\nIn many Member States, energy source of biomass plays a crucial role as primary energy to \ncover the energy needs in the three sectors: heating and cooling, energy and transport. \nNational strategy for biomass prepared in several Member States, is essential to plan the \nrole and the interlinking of the uses among the terminal use of energy and the \ninterconnection with the other non-energy sectors. For this reason, even Albania has \nassessed the domestic potential of biomass to use it with more efficiency in different \nsectors. The supportive measures will be provided with the review of Law on RES. \n3.3.1.1.1 Supply with biomass: domestically and abroad\nBiomass is one of the most implemented sources of energy in Albania \u2013 mainly in the form \nof firewood, combined in some cases with shrubs and waste of the plans from the \nagricultural sector. The consumption of firewood has decreased at about three up to four \ntimes more during the period 1990-2002. After this year, firewood consumption has \nincreased a little in the last years, as the result of the increase of the prices of the other \ncombustibles and energy. The processed wood combustibles \u2013 woodchips, pallets and \nbriquettes \u2013 are not used a lot due to their high price and the underdeveloped supply \nsystem.\nThe remains which have fallen by the trees and the woods of poor quality are mainly used. \nThe waste of biomass from agriculture is not used widely and usually it is destroyed right in \nthe spot. The use of bio-gas is not developed, despite the available resources. It is \nimportant to consider that the majority of the heating equipments which are used \u2013 the \nstoves and the chimneys \u2013 are old and inefficient, with heat loss up to 40-50%. The heating \nthrough the radiators with high efficiency for the local systems is underdeveloped. The \nassessments of the updated energy strategy indicate a considerable potential for extraction \nand exploitation of biomass in Albania from forestry, agriculture and livestock (for bio-gas \nproduction).\nBiomass might be used for the production of energy only in the cogenerating plants (CHP\u0002Combined Heat and Power), especially in the ones which function with sawdust by \ndifferent wood processing industries. Its use in the energy centrals with condensation (it is \nconsidered as unfavourable from the environmental, economic and technical prospective. \nBase on table 6 in the following paragraph it is clear that the information about the \navailable amounts of biomass is insufficient. Of course, the state authorities should make \nmore attempts for the development and the implementation of an information system \nrelated to the sources of biomass, which serves to channel the information in the Natural \nResources National Agency. [18]\n\nApart from the information provided above, table 7b provides that at the moment, there are no \nplans for the use of agricultural land for the production of energy agricultural cultures. \nExploitation of agricultural land for the production of agricultural cultures for \nenergy\nSurface (ha)\nLand used for the trees with a fast growth cycle (willow, poplars) Zero\nLand used for other agricultural energy cultures, such as: grasses (Phalaris \narundinacea, Panicum virgatum, Miscanthus), sorgum\nZero\nTable 7b: Current use of agricultural land for the production of energy agricultural cultures in 2009 (with teh latest data at \ndisposal) [20]\n3.3.2 Measures to increase biomass availability taking into consideration the \nother users of biomass (agriculture and other sectors based on the forests)\nThe role of biomass will increase very little in absolute terms, as it is shown above, but at \nthe same time, its relative contribution will decrease. Measures have been predicted in two \ndirections: \n\uf0b7 The slight decrease of biomass in the final energy consumption; \n\uf0b7 The slight decrease of the heating energy produced by biomass exploitation. \nThe use of biomass has been stable during the last three years for the following reasons: \n\uf0b7 The slow introduction of improved installations used for the exploitation of \nbiomass in heating;\n\uf0b7 The increase of wood price; \n\uf0b7 The improved performance of energy in buildings. \nApart from the above information, we are kindly asking you to describe the current \nagricultural land situation used for energy production as follows: \n\uf0b7 The current use of the agricultural land for the production of agricultural energy \ncultures in 2009 (ha); \n\uf0b7 The use of agricultural land for the production of agricultural energy cultures, \nSurface\n1. Land used for wood with a fast growing cycle (poplins, willows); For the period \n2006-2009 there is no HPPtare of land used for these purposes; \n2. Land used for other agricultural energy cultures, such as: grasses (Phalaris \narundinacea, Panicum virgatum, Miscanthus), sorghum: based on the statistics published \nby INSTAT, there is no HPPtar of land used for these purposes. \n3.3.1.2 Mobilization of the new biomass resources \nAccording to the figures offered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and \nWater Administration (based on the annual publication in 2009), the degraded land surface \nis 12,335 ha. \nThe unused agricultural land is assessed as approximately 34 568 ha. There is no planned \nmeasure for the increase of energy agricultural cultures but at the same time it is important \nto mention the fact that planting energy agricultural cultures is one of the mitigating \nmeasures for the gases with the greenhouse effect, which is mentioned in the Second \nNational Communication of Albania addressed to the Framework Convention of United \nNations on Climate Changes (FCUNCC) from 2009. Energy was not generated from the \nanimals\u2019 fertilizer and some preliminary feasibility studies have been carried out for the \nproduction of bio-gas from the fertilizer of different farms. There are no specific stimuli \nwhich promote the production and the use of bio-gas, apart from its use in the combined \nproduction of heat and energy, based on which the produced amount of energy is bought \nwith preferential prices and Energy Regulatory Entity (ERE) should prepare the special \nfees for this technology. At the moment, the amount of biogas produced is zero; however, \nmeasures have been planned for getting the product in an amount of 7,1 ktoe biogas \npursuant to the current document of RENAP. [21]\nAttempts are being made to improve the management of forests in order to increase the \ndevelopment on the future and the sustainable reproduction. The certification of the \ncommunal forest and the state ones has been planned, to improve the techniques for their \nmanagement. \n3.3.1.3 Influence on other schemes \nNo assessment has been made for the influence of energy use from biomass in the other \nsectors. Such an assessment will be carried out in the future (a draft proposal has been \ndrafted to study these effects. The draft proposal is still under the internal discussion \nthrough the national actors). \nThe use of biofuel in the agriculture sector , 85% of energy consumption in agriculture in \n2009, was based on the liquid combustibles. So, the use of biofuels in this sector would \nfacilitate its increase\n(b) What kind of developments is expected in the other sectors which are based on \nagriculture and forestry, which would influence on energy production? (For example: \nWould the efficiency/the improved product increase or decrease the amount of sub\u0002products at disposal for energy use?)\n \nThe increase of processed biomass production, for example, pallets, etc would cause a \ndecrease in price for the final consumers. This thing would decrease the consumption of \nfirewood and would decrease the loss of the companies which sell them. \nMeasures for the promotion of RES are presented summarized in table 4: [22]\nMeasure name and reference Type of \nmeasure\n\n3.4.1 Administrative procedures and spatial planning\n(a) A list of the existing legislation and if possible, the regional legislation on the procedures of \nauthorization, certification and licensing and territorial planning applied to plants and their power \ntransmission and distribution to the network infrastructure: \nRelevant applicable legislation in the energy sector\n\uf0b7 Law no. 43/2015, dated 30.04.2015 \u201cOn power sector\u201d sets out the main principles for the \nenergy sector development, including RESpower plants and the transmission and distribution \nnetworks.

The new law on power sector (Law no.43/2015) in Article 49 (1) provides for that \nbuilding of new generating capacity up to 2 MW, including renewable energy producers, is approved by \nthe minister responsible for energy. On the other hand, the new law on renewable energy sources (Law\n138/2013), in its Article 10 foresees that the Council of Ministers approves simplified procedures for\nobtaining authorizations and licenses required for the production of energy from RER.\nArticle 37, paragraph 6 (b) of the law on energy sector also provides for that all producers, including the \nproducers connected to the national grid with an installed capacity up to 1 MW, are not obliged to obtain \na production license by ERE. The same law, in Article 39, paragraph 2, provides for that ERE may adopt\nsimplified licensing procedures for producers connected to the distribution network. Based on the above \nlegislation, the Council of Ministers is expected to prepare and adopt specific procedures that will simplify\nthe issuance of construction permit necessary for RESproducers, while ERE will adopt a simplified \nprocedure for the licensing of small producers of electricity, including RESproducers directly connected\nto the distribution network.\nCurrently it appears that there is no unnecessary obstacle or inappropriate claims regarding authorization, \ncertification and licensing procedures applied to plants and associated transmission and distribution \ninfrastructure. Furthermore, the RESlaw contains provisions that exclude small producers of energy, with \ninstalled capacity up to 1 MW, from the obligation to obtain the production license. On the other hand, \nthe creation of the National Licensing Center, according to Law no. 10081 dated 23.02.2009 \"On licenses, \nauthorizations and permits in the Republic of Albania\", as amended, has significantly facilitated the \nprocess of obtaining a license, permit or authorization.\nAuthorizations for the construction of installations of renewable energy are granted by the Council of \nMinisters or by the requirements of the law on concessions for hydropower plants, or as required by law \nfor the energy sector to other types of producers of electricity using renewable energy, or the law on bio\u0002fuels for bio-fuel producers.\nLicenses for the implementation of the activity of power production from renewable energy resources are \nissued by the Energy Regulatory Entity.Any project which envisages the power generation from RESor for any producer of bio-fuels is required \nto perform the procedure of preliminary or in-depth Environmental Impact Assessment (depending on \nthe project), and then if the installation is listed in Annex 1 the law in force for environmental permits, \nand should be supplied with an environmental Permit of type A, B or C. Environmental protection law \nand the law on environmental impact assessment require the Ministry of Environment and its subordinate \ninstitutions and local authorities to cooperate throughout the process, ensuring public participation in any \npotential decision making process.\nAs regards the construction permits, according to the new law on territorial planning (Law no. 107/2014\nand DCM no. 408, dated 13.05.2015), the local authorities are responsible for granting permission for\nconstruction of any power plant. On the other hand, for each installation of photovoltaic or NUED\nsystems in buildings that are not considered as part of cultural heritage, require only a preliminary notice\nof the local authorities (the Mayor). An important improved measure presented by the new legislation on \nterritorial planning is to create a one-stop office (\"One stop shop\") for each building permit. This\nmeasure will reduce the time required for obtaining a construction permit within a period not to exceed\n60 days, and will increase the transparency of the process.\nConcessions for the construction of hydropower plants are awarded through an open and competitive\nbidding process, where bidders are provided equal access to information and data relating to the project. \nThe information and data for a specific concession are also made available in the official website of MEI.\nConditions and criteria for granting a permit for the construction of a plant with renewable resources, \nother than hydropower plant, are already foreseen in the new law for the energy sector (Law no. 43/2015, \ndated 30.04.2015) and the specific Regulation approved by the Council of Ministers (DCM no. 1701, \ndated 17.12.2008).\nLicenses for the production of electricity from renewable resources, transmission and distribution are \ngranted based on the criteria established by law for the energy sector and licensing procedures approved \nby ERE, which are published in the Official Journal and in ERE official website. Interested parties \nwishing to carry out an activity in the energy sector can contact also directly with ERE technical staff, \nwhich is responsible for licensing, and to receive information on the procedures, requirements and \ndocuments to be submitted for obtaining a license.\nThe Albanian government has made a number of efforts to facilitate coordination between different \nadministrative bodies responsible for different parts of the permit for a specific project. Establishment of \nthe National Licensing Center has been a positive step forward in creating a \"one-stop shop\" service for\nall licenses and permits required for a project.\nHowever, according to the legislation in force for the construction of a new plant or new transmission or \ndistribution infrastructure, a series of main authorizations/permits/licenses are approved or other\napproving acts, including:\n- decision of the National Environmental Agency for the preliminary environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) or the Minister\u2019s Declaration for the in-depth EIA as per the stipulations of \nLaw no. 10440, dated 7.7.2011 \u201cOn environmental impact assessment\u201d, as amended;\n- concession or authorization approved by the Council of Ministers or of the minister responsible \nfor energy, in accordance with the law on concessions and law on power sector;\n- activity license issued by the Energy Regulatory Entity.\nAs regards the time limits for application processing, it is hard to provide an average period for \nadministering a case because it largely depends on the project. The major projects should often be \nsubject to a spatial planning process that would require more time, partly due to the complex character of the project and involvement of local population during the reviewing process (process of approval of the \nenvironmental impact assessment).\nIt is worth stressing the fact that legislation provides for the implementation of the principle of \nacquiescence in case of the failure to reply of the administrative institution to a specific request, within a \nspecific time limit provided for in the respective legislation.\nAs regards the EIA process, the legislation foresees some differences. Construction of small power plants \nwith renewable energy, under the legislation in force, are initially subject only to preliminary EIA, and the \nNational Environmental Agency is the one that based on its Decision, decides whether the proposed \nproject should be subject or not to the in-depth EIA. Further, the plants with conventional energy \nundergo a more advanced EIA process. The authorization procedures of Albania take into account the \nspecificities of different technologies of renewable energies, because they are governed by different \nlegislations. As mentioned above, the authorizations for the new hydropower plants are granted in \naccordance with the law on concessions, which contains specific procedures and authorizations for other\nREStechnologies are granted as required by law for the energy sector. Both legislations have different \nprocedures, because while concessions are awarded on the basis of a competitive bidding process, \nauthorizations for other renewable energy technologies are granted on the basis of the principle \"first in \ntime, first in rights\".\nRegarding construction permits, the legislation makes no distinction between renewable energy \ntechnologies and other conventional technologies.\nCurrently, there are no specific procedures in Albania for small decentralized RESinstallations. Both laws, \nthe one for the power sector and on renewable energy, lay down provisions requiring the Council of \nMinisters and ERE to adopt procedures and simpler requirements for providing licenses and permits to \nproducers of eligible RESand small producers.\nTariffs for the authorization of new RESplants are published in the Official Journal and in MEI website\ntogether with the relevant government decision containing the criteria and procedures for reviewing and \ngranting authorizations.\nRoyalties set by ERE for production licenses are published in the Official Journal and in ERE website \ntogether with the regulation on licensing procedures. After the start of production activity, the licensees\nwill be subject to a regulatory fee set by ERE based on their annual turnover, however, these fees are \npublic and are applied proportionally to all licensed companies.\nFees for environmental permits are published in the Official Journal and are and published in the website \nof the MoE.\nConcession fees for the hydropower plants are the result of the bidding process, where bidders offer \nconcession fee based on a percentage of annual output they foresee, which is one of the bid evaluation \nrequirements.\nThere is no official guidance available to local administrative bodies of planning, design, construction and \nrehabilitation of industrial and residential areas to install equipment and systems using renewable energy \nresources for producing electricity, and for heating and cooling purposes.\nThe new law (Article 8) provides for that the Ministry responsible for energy and the agency authorized to \nbe responsible for renewable energy resources, will need to ensure that information on support measures \nfor installations should be available to all interested parties such as developers, sponsors, investors, \nfinancial institutions, builders, installers, architects and suppliers of energy equipment and systems for \nheating and cooling in accordance with the use of energy from renewable resourcesHowever, the law does not set out any deadline or specific procedure on the way how to provide this\ninformation or instruction. Therefore, a specific remedy needs to be applied for this purpose in the near \nfuture, and the order of the minister responsible for energy should be approved.\nOn the other hand, the RESlaw (Article 28/1) provides for that the Council of Ministers shall issue a \nregulation to ensure that the public is made available information on the availability and environmental\nbenefits of all renewable energy resources for transport. Regulation will impose an obligation to specify at \nthe sales points, where the percentages of bio-fuels mixed with crude oil derivatives, exceed the \npercentage of the volume defined by ERE.\n3.4.2 Buildings\nLaw on RES provides for that the Council of Ministers will adopt policies and measures to increase the \nuse of solar energy within buildings, including the obligation for different categories of buildings, whether \nnew or existing, public or private ones, in order to install water heating systems with solar energy to \nproduce hot sanitary or technological water and therefore to meet the objectives set for increasing the \ninput of solar energy in the total energy consumption within the country. The same article requires the \nCouncil of Ministers, upon the approval of the Minister responsible for energy, to identify the economic \nsectors and categories of buildings, the minimum area or capacity of water heating system with solar \nenergy, the technical requirements of water heating systems with solar energy that will be installed, as \nwell as specific procedures and criteria to be followed in connection with the implementation and \nmonitoring of this obligation by the responsible institutions.\nMinistry responsible for the construction sector is the Ministry of Urban Development. However, energy \nissues in buildings are divided to some extent between the Ministry of Urban Development and the \nMinistry of Energy and Industry. It is worth noting that based on current legislation on urban planning \nand development, local authorities have a key role in the construction sector and they are responsible for \nissuing and monitoring construction permits.\nThe new law 124/2015 on energy efficiency attaches stronger role to the Agency responsible for energy \nefficiency regarding the energy performance in buildings, where the conformity of each objective \nmandatory for RESinstallation within buildings will be monitored in the framework of overall \nperformance of the building.\nRER law does not set out any deadline or schedule on this measure, however, a draft governmental\ndecision is already prepared, establishing a schedule for the mandatory installation of NUED systems in \ndifferent categories of buildings. It is important that the adoption and implementation of this decision is \nin line with the new legislation on the energy performance of buildings (energy efficiency legislation).\nAnother major revision of the existing legislation is the one proposed by the UNDP Program on Climate\nChanges for the establishment and strengthening of the market of solar panels for hot water, and for \nrevision of Law no.10112, dated 9.4.2009 \"On administration of co-ownership in residential buildings. \" \nBased on the proposed revisions, NUED system installations must be included in the joint ownership of \napartment buildings enabling a better functioning and management of these systems.\nAccording to UNDP Program on Climate Changes for creating and strengthening of market solar panels\nfor hot water, a proposal is made by virtue of a decision of the municipal council of Tirana for installation\nwithin minimum surfaces of NUED into different categories of buildings, including buildings with \nhouseholds, apartment blocks, private offices, hotels and restaurants, sports facilities.According to the draft decision, this NUED system will have a surface area to meet at least 60% of the \ndemand for hot water, apart from the open-door swimming pools that should fully heat water from solar \nthermal energy systems.\nCurrently, there is no minimum level for the use of renewable energy in building regulations and codes. \nAs mentioned above, the new law on renewable energies requires the Council of Ministers to set \nminimum targets for the production of sanitary and technological hot water with solar energy in \nbuildings, and mandatory installation of NUED systems for a category of buildings. Meanwhile, a\ngovernmental draft decision is prepared on mandatory installation of NUED systems within buildings. \nThe draft-decision also contains minimum NUED area that must be installed to meet the building \ndemand for hot water. According to the draft decision, this NUED system will have an area to meet at \nleast 60% of the demand for hot water, apart from the addition that will have to heat water completely by \nsolar thermal energy systems.\nThe national policy has not taken into account any obligations for the minimum levels of renewable \nenergy at the new and recently refurbished buildings. Based on the requirements of the new law on \nrenewable energies, these minimum levels should be taken into account in these policies.\n3.4.3 Informative provisions\nCurrent and future information, as well as awareness campaigns and programs together with planned \nrevisions and expected results should be described. Member States should also indicate which responsible \nauthority will monitor and review the effects of the programs. When regional authorities / governments \nhave a key role, please specify and summarize.\nAccording to Article 8 of the law on renewable energies, the Ministry responsible for energy and the \nauthorized agency being responsible for renewable energy resources (NANR) ensures that all \nstakeholders, such as customers, developers, planners, sponsors, investors, financial institutions, builders, \ninstallers, architects and suppliers of equipment and heating and cooling systems, electrical power \nequipment and other devices that use renewable energy, are made available information on support \nmeasures for plants that use renewable energy resources.\nThe same article (paragraph 2) provides for that the Ministry responsible for energy or agency responsible \nfor renewable energy should develop appropriate programs for training or guidance on public awareness \nand information, in order to inform the interested parties and citizens about the benefits, costs and \nrealization of the development and use of energy from renewable sources.\nMinistry responsible for energy or subordinate institutions have not provided detailed rules or procedures \non the way how to provide this information or awareness. However, it should be noted that a series of \nawareness campaigns have been launched by energy institutions in Albania to promote the use of RESin \nAlbania, through various seminars, advertising in mass media etc. Ministry responsible for energy, \ntogether with its subordinate agencies, have organized a number of promotional activities that private \ninvestors invest in small power products with very good results. In recent years, a large number of private \ninvestors have shown keen interest to invest in electricity produced from water and wind.\nThere is still no plan of measures to promote the use of RESat a local level. The new territorial reforms, \nwhich will enable the creation of large municipalities expected to emerge after local elections of June \n2015, can be a key opportunity to enhance the role of local authorities for the implementation of\nRESpolicies.Currently, there are no bodies responsible for providing information on the use of renewable energies in \nthe heating and cooling sector and transport sector. As mentioned above, the new law on renewable \nenergy (Article 25), the Council of Ministers issues a regulation to ensure that public is given information \non the ownership and environmental benefits from all different sources of renewable energy for \ntransport. Regulation should also foresee the obligation to specify at the sales points when the content of \nbio-fuels diluted in oil byproducts exceed the limit set in percentage, according to the stipulations made \nby ERE.\nAs mentioned above, the new draft on renewable energies requires, with regard to information on \nsupport measures for the use of renewable resources for electricity, the government has made available \nthis information to investors not only through legislation published in the Official Journal or various \nwebsites, but also through a series of public events such as conferences, seminars etc.\nThe government aims to transform the agency responsible for renewable energies into an information \ncenter for all stakeholders regarding support measures for the use of renewable energies.\nCurrently, no institution or agency is responsible for developing and providing guidance for planners and \narchitects to help them to take into due account the optimal combination of renewable energy resources, \nhigh-efficiency technologies, as well as central heating and cooling when planning, designing, building and \nrefurbishing industrial or residential areas.\nThe Albanian government is preparing new legislation on energy efficiency and energy performance of \nbuildings, including specific provisions for the optimal combination of renewable energy resources and \nhigh-efficiency technologies in planning, designing, building and refurbishing industrial or residential \nareas.\nInformation, awareness and training programs on the benefits and practices of using renewable energies \nto date have not been properly organized. Institutions responsible for energy policy, mainly for the \nsupport of international donors, have launched a series of information and awareness campaigns, but with \nlittle results. The only area where these programs have had satisfactory results are programs for the \npromotion of small power producers. A great interest is recently shown by the Ministry responsible for \nenergy and the National Agency of Natural Resources to promote solar panel systems for hot water at \nlocal level.\n3.4.4 Electricity infrastructure development\nIn addition to the existing situation and future actions of the current legislation, a description should be \nmade of the planned revisions, relevant responsible bodies and expected results.\nThe existing domestic legislation includes as follows:\n\uf0b7 Law no.43/2015, dated 30.04.2015 \u201cOn energy sector\u201d;\n\uf0b7 Law no.138/2013, dated 2.05.2013 \u201cOn renewable energy resources\u201d\n\uf0b7 Transmission Code\n\uf0b7 Distribution Code\n\uf0b7 Measurement Code\n\uf0b7 Market Rules\n\uf0b7 Law no. 107, dated 31.07.2014 \u201cOn territorial planning and development\u201d, as amended\n\uf0b7 Law no. 91/2013 \u201cOn environmental strategic assessment\u201d\n\uf0b7 Law no.10440, dated 07.07.2011 \u201cOn environmental impact assessment\u201d, as amended\n\uf0b7 Law no. 10448, dated 14.07.2011 \u201cOn environmental permits\u201d, as amended\uf0b7 Other secondary legislation approved in conformity with law.\nAccording to the law on energy sector (Article 60), the Transmission System Operator, in consultation \nwith interested stakeholders, draws up a ten-year plan on network developments and submits it for \napproval to ERE. Network development plan should take into account existing and scheduled demand \nfor electricity; urban and regional planning of the area where transmission installations are extended; \ninvestment plans for regional networks and legislation on environmental protection, in particular the \nrequirements of applicable law on environmental strategic assessment.\nAlso, the Transmission Code (Chapter 2, 3 and 4), Transmission Operator System (TSO) is, inter alia, \nresponsible for the operation, development and expansion of the transmission network, as well as for the \nmanagement of any transit of electricity between foreign systems using Albanian grid. According to \nArticle III.5.1 of the Transmission Code, TSO is required to produce a Perspective Plan that covers a \nperiod of 15 years for the development of transmission system, taking into account the forecasts for \nelectricity demand, peak capacity, additional capacities for electricity, transmission capacities, losses and \nother important parameters of SEE.\nOn the other hand, the Distribution Code (article II.4) requires the Distribution System Operator (DSO) \nto prepare a development plan for the distribution system based on the study of the future development \nof electric grid for an average period of 5 years and maximum 10 year term.\nBoth the transmission and distribution code will be revised to be in line with the provisions of law for the \nenergy sector.\nIt is clear that any development plan must take into account the National Energy Strategy, updated for \nthe development of energy resources, including the production of electricity from renewable sources.\nCurrently, TSO has in place not a too modern system of information measurement and collection. \nHowever, in recent years TSO realized a new dispatch center, together with a more advanced SCADA \nsystem that will enable TSO to gather real-time information from all producers of electricity and \ntransformation points.\nThe new energy law (Article 78) requires that intelligent metering systems of end users can be installed in \nthe power supply market. Implementation of intelligent metering systems will undergo a preliminary \neconomic assessment, which must take into account all long-term future costs and benefits of the market \nand clients, including also the form of intelligent metering to be selected , which must be economically \nmore effective and with more appropriate time limit for applying in practice such metering system. DSO \nwill perform an economic assessment and prepare a schedule with the aim of installing intelligent \nmetering systems within a period of 10 years.\nAlbanian operator of the transmission system has already completed a new 400 kV interconnection line\nwith Montenegro (Tirana 2 - Podgorica), which increased the capacity of the Albanian system \ninterconnection up to 1000 MW.\nCurrently, OST is working to build a new 400 kV line with Kosovo (Tirana 2 - Pristina), which is \nexpected to be completed in 2016.\nIn addition, a Memorandum of Understanding is signed between the Albanian and Macedonian \ntransmission system operators for the construction of a new 400 kV line (Elbasan-Bitola). The project is \nexpected to be financed by German KfW bank.Private investors have also shown interest to build an underwater cable system linking Albania to Italy. All \nthese interconnections are increasing and strengthening the interconnection capacity of Albania with \nother neighboring states, which will largely facilitate the potential development of a regional market, \nwhere power plants with RESare expected to play a key role, considering the substantial resources in \nAlbania and in other regional countries.\nAccording to article 31 of Law no. 40/2015, dated 30.04.2015 \"On power sector\" authorization for \nconstruction of new interconnection lines, whether funded by the TSO or by private persons, should be \napproved by the Council of Ministers.\nFurthermore, construction permits for network infrastructure are granted to companies that have a \nlicense for the transmission and/or distribution of power. According to Law no. 107/2014 dated \n31.07.2014 \"On territorial planning and development\u201d and DCM no. 408, dated 13.05.2015 \"On approval \nof the regulation on territorial development\", every construction permit for energy infrastructure will be \ngranted by the National Territory Council.\nProjects for building new infrastructure facilities for electricity are required to undergo the procedure of \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment according to provisions of applicable legislation in this area.\nThe main problems that transmission and distribution companies face in the construction of a line are \nrelated to land ownership. These issues are not related to the cost of paying the compensation price in \ncase of expropriation, instead they are linked with the fact that in many cases landowners do not possess \nthe certificate of ownership, since most of the lands in remote areas are not registered with the \nImmovable Property Registration Office.\nProcedures for transfer of land ownership, where the project is implemented, are followed in accordance \nwith law 8361, dated 22.12.1999 \"On expropriation and temporary usufruct of private property for public \ninterest\". For this purpose, the interested subject prepares the relevant file as required by law.\nThe file is sent to the Ministry of Energy and Industry (MEI), which designated the Special Committee on \nExpropriation to review the file. If the file is completed in accordance with the law, MEI sends a proposal \nfor expropriation to the Council of Ministers, which decides in favor where it notes that expropriation is \nbased on law.\nFurther, the applicant properly compensates the owners according to tariffs set by withdrawing the title \nof ownership (retrieved from the Immovable Property Chief Registrar Office) and an identity document \nand prepares documentation for registration of property in his/her name with IPRO.\nDue to the difficulties of Albania in administrative spatial planning, there existed a more efficient \ncoordination between grid infrastructure approval and other administrative procedures planning. \nHowever, specific regulations adopted by the ERE regarding the review and approval of investment plans \nof the licensees in the electricity sector provides that such plans must take into account any spatial \nplanning to develop the institutions of central or local authorities.\nDiscipline and better planning of new constructions will facilitate the development and building of a new \nnetwork infrastructure in the future.\nAccording to Article 11 of the law on renewable energies, at the request of a producer and in accordance \nwith ERE regulations, the network system operators realize the connection of the plant with its point in \nthe network system at the best option possible regarding the distance and technical requirements of the \nplant, if the network system has no other more favorable connection point. In choosing the best and most appropriate network, the system operator must take into account technical limitations or technical \nefficiency of the point where connection will be realized.\nThe same article (paragraph 2) provides that network system operators, at the request of the manufacturer \nof highest priority, make the connection of the plant with its point in the system, at the best option \npossible for the manufacturer with priority from the location of the plant, meeting the technical \nrequirements of the plant, if the network system has no other more favorable connection.\nThere are no such cases because the current legislation requires that before a concession or authorization\nis granted for the construction of a new power generator from TSO or DSO, a connection point should \nbe ensured to the transmission or distribution network.\nAccording to the Power Sector Law (article 28) any costs of connection to the transmission and / or \ndistribution network of a producer of electricity, including RES electricity producers, will be borne by the \nmanufacturer. The connection procedures are defined by codes of transmission or distribution. Article 27 \nof the law on energy sector provides for that each new connection will be based on the rules and \nprocedures proposed by the licensee and approved by ERE, including the cost calculation methodology \nand standard agreement of network connectivity.\nHowever, the new law on renewable sources (article 11) provides for that operators of network system \nmust optimize, expand and improve the system for connection and transmission of electricity from new \npower plants that use renewable energy resources, in accordance with the National Action Plan for \nRenewable Energy, master-plans of network operators to expand network system or any official \ndocument in force. These plans for optimization, expansion and reconstruction of the network system, \nwhere appropriate, should include the capacities of interconnection, intelligent networks and \naccumulation capabilities, in order to ensure the operation of network operator, and adaption of further \ndevelopments for the production of electricity from renewable energy resources.\nThe same article stipulates that network system operators should develop and publish standard rules for \nkeeping and sharing costs of technical adaptations, such as network connections and strengthening of \nnetwork, improvement of the operation of networks and rules for the non-discriminatory implementation \nof network codes required to integrate a new producer on the national grid. These rules should be based \non objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria taking into account all costs and benefits from \nthe connection of producers to the network, as well as special circumstances of producers located in \nperipheral regions and in regions with low population density. Standard rules on cost maintenance and \nsharing will be approved by ERE.\nAny expenses incurred by transmission and distribution system operators to improve relevant systems in \norder to enable the connection of new producers of electricity with RESare reflected in their rates of \ntransmission and distribution approved by ERE, if the investment for these improvements is previously \nconsented by ERE.\nCosts incurred by electricity producers for connection to the grid will be borne by themselves. As \nmentioned above, the new law on renewable resources authorizes ERE to develop standard rules, \nincluding the allocation of costs between electricity producers and RES network operator. However, \nthese specific rules are not yet developed and approved.\nThere are no such rules for costs associated with upgrading of the network. If an investment for \nconnection of a new producer of electricity is done by the private investor, any connection to other \nmanufactuRES who use this investment will be subject to a private agreement between the two manufactures. Specific rules for the cost allocation of connection to the grid, as required by law for \nrenewable energies, would include provisions dealing with the connection of this producer to a \nconnection of an existing plant, already included by the first manufacturer.\nCurrently, the connection of new producers with RES is done according to specific rules contained in the \ntransmission and distribution code, but the primary legislation does not include any specific provision for \nthis purpose. Renewable energy law (Article 11/3) provides for that, upon the request of producers \nseeking connection to the network systems, network system operators will give them full and necessary \ninformation, including\n- A comprehensive and detailed assessment of the costs for physical connection to the network;\n- Reasonable and accurate time limit for receiving and processing the request for grid connection;\n- Reasonable time limit for any proposed grid connection.\n- All these requirements will also be part of the relevant codes or other special regulations approved \nby ERE.\n3.4.5 Grid operation \nThe new law on energy sector (Article 29) provides for that operators of transmission and distribution \nsystem ensure access to the network for all clients and users of the system, on transparent and non\u0002discriminatory basis and at ERE approved and published tariffs. The same article foresees that producers \nwho produce energy from renewable sources, have priority access to the grids.\nThe new law on renewable energies (article 11/7) provides for that transmission and distribution of \nelectricity produced from renewable energy resources are guaranteed, except in emergency situations \ndefined in the law on energy sector or in the transmission and distribution codes. In the course of the \ndispatch of power generation plants, the Transmission System Operator will attach priority to power\ngeneration installations to the extent that allows safe operation of the national electricity system and based \non transparent and non-discriminatory criteria.\nCurrently, all existing producers of electricity in Albania rely on hydropower, therefore no priority is \nattached to the generating installations. Furthermore, the transmission system operation is carried out by \nan independent operator of the transmission system that dispatches the producers based on market rules.\nAs for producers connected to the distribution network, existing legislation guarantees their access to the \nnetwork, unless there is a security problem with the functioning of the network.\nConstraints/interruptions of electricity from renewable sources are reported when the distribution system \noperator has been forced, due to technical reasons, to disconnect a remote area where it is and where the \nsmall hydropower manufacturer is connected. The Albanian government has prepared a purchase \ncontract for small hydropower plants based on the principle \"take or pay\", which will guarantee that in \nthe event of constraint/interruption by the network operator without a technical reason small producers \nof electricity will be compensated for the decreased product.\nEnergy Regulatory Entity (ERE) is the responsible institution for monitoring the application and \nimplementation of the measures described above. This regulatory entity is also responsible for the \nadoption of secondary legislation on the operation of network.\nAll RESpower plants are integrated in the energy market. The energy market is designed in accordance \nwith the Albanian market model adopted by DCM no. 338, dated 19.3.2008. This market model requires \nthat all electricity of the distributed producer ( ) be purchased by the buyer at a regulated promotional fee \napproved by ERE. At the same time, ERE has approved a standard agreement for the purchase of electricity (EPA) for these SHPPs. However, the model also foresees that SHPPs sell their electricity in \nthe market at market prices, if they prefer so.\nAlbania has adopted a new law on the energy sector (lawnNo.43 /2015, dated 30. 04.2015) and secondary \nlegislation should be developed to implement this new law, including a new model of the market and new \nmarket rules. Considering that the new law abolishes the concept of Public Wholesale Supplier, a new \nentity is expected to be designated as a recipient of electricity produced from renewable energy plants.\nOn the other hand, power producers (IPPs), which do not meet the conditions to receive a promotional\nfee of selling electricity to the receiver, can sell electricity to DSO at negotiable prices to cover the losses \nof distribution or to sell in their energy at the competitive domestic market or export it abroad by using \nthe right of access to the transmission system.\nAll electricity producers are required to be licensed by ERE and be registered with the market operator, \nand to pay a financial guarantee. These requirements are the same for the participants in the market and \nno preferential treatment is afforded to RES producers of electricity.\nThe new law on power sector envisages that energy market should be consolidated in Albania, in order to \nfurther increase transparency and competition in the wholesale market. Day-ahead market will create \nmore market opportunities for renewable energy plants, especially for those that are not eligible for a \npromotional fee.\nBased on the transmission and distribution tariff methodologies, and according to market rules approved \nby ERE, transmission or distribution tariffs in the domestic market are paid as per the load and not by \nproducers. There are no plans to introduce a distribution or transmission fee for electricity producers, \nincluding those with RES plants in the near future.\n3.4.6 Development of regional heating and cooling infrastructure\nThe country has no long-distance heating or cooling infrastructure and no specific legislation for long\u0002distance heating or cooling is approved or expected to be approved\n3.4.7 Bio-fuels and other bio-liquids-sustainability criteria and cHPPking of \ncompliance\nThe following part of the national action plan should explain the future strategy of the Contracting\nParties to meet sustainability criteria for bio-fuels and bio-liquids and cHPPk the compliance with the \nscheme.\nIn February 2008 Albania adopted a special law on bio-fuels and other renewable fuels for use in \ntransport (law no. 9876, dated 14.02.2008). The purpose of this law is to promote the production and use \nof bio-fuels and other renewable fuels used for the replacement of oil byproducts in the transport sector, \nin order to contribute to the accomplishment of commitments established under Kyoto Protocol for\nclimate changes, as well as provide tools and promote renewable energy resources through the \nintroduction and cultivation of crops for energy and environmental protection. The law transposes the\nprevious EU Directive2003/30/EC of 8 May 2003 on the promotion of bio-fuels or other renewable \nfuels used for transport. However, the current law has no special provision to define the sustainability \ncriteria for bio-fuels and bio-liquids.\nThe Albanian government is in the process of development of a new law on bio-fuels to transpose the \nDirective 2009/28/EC.The new law is expected to contain a number of provisions on the sustainability criteria for bio-fuels and \nbio-liquids produced or traded in the Albanian market.\nLaw on bio-fuels has set specific objectives for the use of bio-fuels in the transport sector, and according \nto the new law on renewable sources, these objectives will be integrated into the overall objective of \nrenewable energies in the total final consumption within the country. Every compliance with the \nobjectives set by law for the consumption of bio-fuels and NREAP will be monitored by State Technical \nand Industrial Inspectorate, which is the successor of the former Central Technical Inspectorate.\nAccording to the new law on renewable sources, the National Action Plan for Renewable Energies to be \nadopted by the Council of Ministers, will be monitored by the agency responsible for renewable energy \nresources, which is expected to have authority and powers to monitor compliance with targets set for all \nrenewable resources, including bio-fuels.\nWhile the current law on renewable sources has no special provisions for the sustainability criteria on bio\u0002fuels and bio-liquids, the new draft law on bio-fuels will incorporate such criteria transposing the\nDirective 2009/28/EC. At the same time, the new draft law on bio-fuels will require the responsible \nAgency for renewable sources that in cooperation with the respective authorities responsible for \nagriculture and forestry, it will monitor and cHPPk compliance of bio-fuel producers with the \nsustainability criteria defined by law.\nNational Agency for Natural Resources, which is responsible for renewable sources, as required by the \nrevised law on renewable resources, will have responsibility for monitoring and cHPPking the compliance \nwith sustainability criteria. This Agency is expected to be supported by responsible authorities for \nagriculture and forests based on the new law on administrative and territorial division.\nProtected areas established in accordance with law no. 8906, dated 6.6.2002 \"On protected areas\" are \nmanaged by the relevant state authority set up by the Decision of Council of Ministers, depending on the \ntype and nature of the protected area. The composition, duties, responsibilities and functioning of the \nadministration of each category of protected area are approved by the Council of Ministers.\nMoE, after approval by the Council of Ministers, can take over the management of protected areas, \nincluding its auspices of the respective administrative body for this administration.\nME defines the method of marking the protected areas on the ground and on the map. The emblem of \nthe Republic of Albania will be used to mark the protected areas. ME informs the relevant geodesic and \nmapping bodies about the statements, changes or removal of the protected area status. Protected areas \nare registered with the central archiving system of the Ministry of Environment, which is created by using \ndata of the relevant state institutions and other specialized institutions.\nMM formulates and approves rules for establishment, operation and use of the central archiving system. \nThe central archiving system of protected areas is open to the public and everyone can use it with \npermission and in the presence of an authorized official.\nLaw no. 8906, dated 6.6.2002 \"On protected areas\" provides special protection for some key components \nof nature and biodiversity. This law classifies protected areas into six categories, as follows:\na. strictly natural reserve/scientific reserves - Category I\nb. national parks - Category II\nc. natural monuments - Category III\nd. managed nature reserve / area of management of habitats and species - Category IV\ne. protected Landscape - Category Vf. protected area of managed resources - Category VI\nThe categorization of areas, status and level of protection for each area based on the criteria of the World \nCentre for Nature Conservation.\nFor each category, the legislation provides a certain level of protection. Categories of protected areas are \ndefined in the Decision of the Council of Ministers for their recognition.\nArticle 4/3 of the Law also foresees that areas where natural habitat species of interest to the European \nCommunity, as well as other habitats of interest to this community, are declared areas of special \nconservation. These areas are part of the national ecological network and may include protected areas and \necosystems, habitats and landscapes outside the network. Minister responsible for the environment \napproves the list of Albanian areas of interest to the European Community.\nThe law provides that protected areas are declared land, water, marine and coastal areas designated for the \nprotection of biodiversity, natural, cultural and social features managed by legal remedies and modern \nscientific methods.\nArticle 15 of the law stipulates that the Ministry of Environment, other state agencies and local \ngovernment authorities or in cooperation with third parties, draw up for each protected area, \nmanagement plans of this area. Management plans of protected areas will be included in policies, plans \nand programs related thereto, as well as in decision-making at the national, regional or local level.\nProcedures for changing the status of agricultural land are provided by DCM no. 665, dated 28.07.2010 \n\"On the rules and procedures of change of categories of land resources\" and DCM. no. 410, dated \n27.06.2012 \"On establishment of rules and procedures of change of categories of land resources\" \nincluding a number of requirements for each application associated with the land status change. The \nprocess involves a number of institutions, Regional Directorates of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture, \nRural Development and Water Administration, Regional Forest Service and Ministry of Environment in \ncases of the change of forest land status.\nThe decision on the land status change is made by the Minister of Agriculture, Rural Development and \nWater Administration to change the status of agricultural land to forest land, pasture or meadow and \nthrough a joint decision of the Minister of Agriculture, Rural Development and Water Administration and \nthe Minister of Environment to change the status of forest land, pasture or meadow to agricultural land.\nThe protection status of a protected area is removed or changed when the circumstances or objective for \ngranting this status has changed. The status of a protected area is revoked by a Decision of Council of \nMinisters, with proposal of the Ministry of Environment, after receiving feedback from specialized \ninstitutions, local government authorities, non-profit organizations and owners when their properties are \npart of the protected area.\nThe proposal on revocation of the status of a protected area should include:\na) Justification for the status revocation ;\nb) environmental impact assessment that reflects the impact on the existing categorization of the \nprotected area, biodiversity and local communities or populations;\nc) a description of mitigation measures;\nd) the results of the coordination and consultation processes with stakeholders from civil society, \nespecially with populations or communities within and around the protected area, including a summary of \ncomments received and reflection on the proposal.\nThe legislation has not provided for any time limit to update the registry (cadastral) of land zoning, \nhowever the legislation requires that under the new territorial and administrative division, the Department \nof Land Administration and Protection should update cadastral documentation for the territory under their jurisdiction and they are also obliged to inform the local immovable property registration offices of \nany changes of land categories, which can be adopted according to the requirements and procedures of \nthe applicable legislation.\nThe Albanian legislation generally requires that raw materials used in agriculture should meet the best \nagrarian-environmental practices. The use of raw materials in agriculture is regulated by Law no. 7659, \ndated 12.01.1993 \"On seeds and saplings\". The State Entity of Seeds and Saplings is set up for the \npurposes of quality control for the plant cultivation material and for conservation of genetic material. \nThis institution is under the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Water Administration. The \nState Entity for Seeds and Saplings is the only governmental body responsible for licensing the \nimportation or exportation of any kind of plant cultivation material.\n3.5 Intended use of statistical transfers between Member States and planned \nparticipation in joint projects with other member states and third countries\nThis sub-chapter should describe the intended use of cooperation mechanisms between Member States \nand third countries like Albania. This information should be based on what is provided in the forecast \ndocument, referred to in Article 4 (3) of Directive 2009/28/EC.\n3.5.1 Procedural aspects\nAccurate, reliable and timely assessment of production capacities is essential for the country's ability to \nprovide statistically \"surplus production\" for Member States, taking into account the mandatory \npercentage of renewable energies in energy consumption.\nThe establishment of national procedures requires the creation of an updated and well-coordinated \nregister of gross final energy consumption in all sectors of the economy and reliable tracking of the \nimplementation of renewable energy projects. In the sector of electricity, gross production and \nconsumption from renewable energy resources is determined on the basis of guarantees/certificate of \norigin. Currently in Albania there is still no market for warranties/certificates of origin (e.g. as part of the \nsales of energy green certificates (produced from renewable sources). Detailed promotions of the \nguarantee /certificate of origin under the new law on RESare set out in Articles 19, 20 and 21.\n3.3.1.4 Certificate of origin warranty\nERE, at the request of a manufacturer that has been supplied by ERE with technical preliminary \nqualification for the plant with renewable energy under provisions of the regulation referred to in \nparagraph 10 of this Article, will issue a certificate of origin guarantee for electricity or heat produced by a \ngenerating plant. Guarantees of Origin will apply to the standard size of 1 MWh and will specify:\n\u2022 energy resources from which electricity is produced, classified by type and key components, including \nthe information to what extent the electricity was produced from renewable energy resources;\n\u2022 exclusive percentage of biomass, in cases where biomass is used;\n\u2022 name and address of the producer;\n\u2022 location, capacity and date of commissioning of the plant;\n\u2022 Period during which energy is produced and to what extent it is paid in accordance with Articles 15 and \n16 of this Law, and\n\u2022 Place of issue and unique identification number.\nERE will supervise the issuance, transfer and cancellation of guarantees of origin in accordance with the \nprovisions of the regulation issued under paragraph 9 of this article.Guarantees of origin are issued based on comprehensive data and correct information to certify the origin \nof electricity supplied by the manufacturer and certified measurement data from network system operator. \nGuarantees of origin are issued only if the producer provides all the information required under \nparagraph (2) of this Article.\nAny use of the guarantee of origin is made within 12 months of production of the corresponding energy \nunit. The guarantee of origin is canceled after use.\nIf electricity is produced from a hydro power plant with a reversible pumping system, guarantees of origin \nwill be issued only for the amount of energy corresponding to the difference between the electricity \nproduced by hydropower plant and electricity consumed by the reversible pumping system.\nIf electricity is produced from biomass, guarantees of origin will be issued only for the percentage of \nenergy corresponding to the bio-degradable share, as defined in paragraph 1 of Article 3 of this law.\nWithin a period of 12 months from the date of entry into force of this law, ERE will create an electronic \nregister of guarantees of origin with a suitable mechanism for data processing to ensure that guarantees of \norigin are issued, transferred and canceled electronically and are accurate, reliable and not subject to fraud. \nAny interested party is entitled to freely have access to this register.\nWithin the same period referred to in paragraph 8 of this article, ERE will adopt a specific regulation for \nthe procedure applied for guarantees of origin. The regulation foresees in particular:\nDocuments to be submitted by the Producer for technical qualification of its installation as a plant for \ngenerating electricity or heat from renewable energy resources.\nTechnical qualification procedure and in particular the timeframe within which ERE must respond to \napplications submitted, as well as the legal consequences due to failure to meet this obligation.\n3.3.1.5 Monitoring procedure\nProcedure applied to the issuance, registration, transfer or cancellation of guarantees of origin.\nIssues related to cooperation with competent authorities of the EU Member States and other countries \nwith which an agreement is signed for mutual recognition of guarantees of origin. ERE is responsible for \nchanging the previous regulations on the procedure applied for guarantees of origin to reflect the \nprovisions set out in paragraph 9 of this article\n3.3.1.6 Monitoring procedure and prohibition of multiple sales\nTo ensure that the conditions for issuing the guarantees of origin are met and that data and information \non which their issue is based are correct, ERE representatives and any person authorized by it, have a \nright of free access to the respective generation plant and to all data and information related thereto, \nwithout prejudice to the maintenance of business secrets. The producer is obliged to facilitate the work of \nERE representatives and the persons authorized by it.\nElectricity and heat produced from renewable energy resources, as well as landfill gas or gas from \nwastewater treatment disposed to the gas network cannot be sold or transferred more than once. As a \nresult, the Producer is paid by promotional legal fees and will not be permitted to transfer or sell any \nguarantee of origin for electricity. If the Producer delegates this guarantee of origin for electricity from \nrenewable energy resources, no feed-in tariff can be paid for electricity and the Producer may lose \nbenefits from feed-in tariffs.3.3.1.7 International cooperation for origin guarantees\nThe guarantee of origin for electricity produced from renewable energy resources, which is issued by a \nstate that is a Contracting Party or a Member State of a Contracting Party to the Energy Community \nTreaty, is also recognized in Albania.\nThe Council of Ministers or the Ministry responsible for energy may enter into agreements with one of \nEU member states or a contracting party to the Treaty of the Energy Community for Southeastern \nEurope for mutual recognition of guarantees of origin for the purposes of measuring compliance with the \nrequirements of Article 4 of this law on general national objectives for renewable energy.\nGuarantees of Origin issued/registered by ERE and this mechanism are sufficient to determine the \nproduction of renewable energy as part of the gross final consumption of electricity.\nIt is more difficult to determine the major contribution of biomass energy in the heating and cooling \nsector. Given the huge consumption of wood biomass for heating purposes, the estimation of the part of \nrenewable energy resources in final energy consumption in this sector requires information on:\n\uf0b7 total direct supply with wood biomass (from the managed forests);\n\uf0b7 total direct supply of wood biomass from individual collection of villagers;\n\uf0b7 total biomass supply from industrial waste (from the wood processing and furniture industry, \nsawmill units, paper and paper pulp processing industry, recycling of wood);\n\uf0b7 total recycled / remained / regenerated biomass;\n\uf0b7 assessment of the gross calorific value of alternative biomass \n\uf0b7 total biomass production from energy agricultural crops;\nTo this end, we need to ensure close cooperation between the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment and Water Administration, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Energy and Industry, \nMinistry of Public Works and Transport, National Agency of Natural Resources and Institute of Statistics \n(INSTAT).\nBased on the above information, it can determine the total energy content of the total biomass \nproduction can be calculated compared to the corresponding total energy content of fuel used for \nheating. Despite the great variety of combustion technologies with high efficiency, it can be assumed that \nin a certain use, the total usable energy content of the biomass would be equal to that of ordinary fuels, \ni.e. bio-fuels directly replace the same amount of conventional energy.\nERE and the National Agency of Natural Resources will administer a national database for electricity, for \nall the statistical data related to energy resources as described above. Statistical guarantees of origin shall \nbe issued for every 1 MWh (0.086 toe) produced from renewable energy resources in transport and \nheating, as well as for electricity produced from renewable energy resources. These origin warranties will \nbe available for trading by EU member states.\nThe implementation of renewable energy projects can be combined with the implementation of energy \nefficiency measures based on NAPEE, already approved by the Albanian Government on September 9, \n2011. Given the national potential for implementing energy efficiency measures, a key criterion in the \nselection of fund-eligible projects will be the participation of enterprises making improvements in energy \nefficiency, for example, enterprises with high demand for energy, large buildings and energy traders. \nAnother advantage would be the existence of an energy audit report to contain information about the \neconomic advantages of energy efficiency measures, allowing an assessment whether these measures \nshould be integrated or not to the measures for renewable energies.Contracts with guaranteed results, together with grant financing for additional measures from the state \nbudget, private investors and the operational programs will constitute an appropriate mechanism.\nAlbania is ready to participate in joint projects with Member States. After the approval of law on RER, \nERE shall prepare feed-in tariffs for cogeneration plants using biomass energy.\n3.3.1.8 Calculated surplus of the production of renewable energies that may be transferred to \nother member states compared to the indicative trajectory\nIn the best scenario for the development of energy production from renewable sources, combined with a \nfirm policy on energy efficiency, Albania has high potential for statistical transfers to other member states, \nespecially based on the concept that only wind power plants (eolic parks/wind farms) with a capacity of \n100-120 MW would be needed to meet RESobjective. Wind potential is approximately 1500 MW, as it \nwill be mentioned in the following section, and all the difference will be available for export purposes.\n3.3.1.8.1 Potential calculated for joint projects\nThere are a number of options for the development of projects for the use of renewable energy in \nAlbania. Production of electricity from renewable energy resources is strongly supported by the domestic \nlegislation and a number of investors from the European Union. Several projects have already been \ncompleted, while others are ongoing. There are a number of opportunities for joint projects in this field \nwithin the range of up to 3000 MW of installed capacity (mainly hydropower, wind, biomass and solar \nenergy).\nHowever, economic conditions in Albania require a combination of policies to encourage the use of \nrenewable energy policy promoting the production of heat, which is much more efficient in terms of \nprimary energy use and requires less relative investment. Costs of supply and transformation would also \nbe lower because production would be closer to the consumer. There are a number of options:\n\u2022 a large-scale program to promote the use of solar panels for water heating, thus reducing energy use. It \nis worth noting that UNDP program on Climate Changes supported by FGM and the Albanian \ngovernment is working for two years to promote this technology as one of the main uses of RESto cover \nthe demand for hot water, coupled with the reduction of gases with greenhouse effect;\n\u2022 combined burning of fossil fuels and biomass for central / regional heating in public buildings;\n\u2022 expansion of the production of wood chips from wood waste use, with a view of replacing installations \nfor the production of heat in industry and public services buildings.\n\u2022 The Albanian Government is also implementing a project to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy \nresources for heating / water heating in public buildings. This project supported by KfW \"Promotion of \nenergy efficiency of renewable energy resources in Albania\" is already implemented as a pilot project in \nthree cases and is planning to invest around 5 million Euro in various public buildings. The fuel-operated \ncurrent boilers can be completely replaced with plants using solid biomass, bio-gas or bio-fuels to meet \nenergy demand for the heating of premises and solar collectors to cover hot water demand.\nYes, a proper technology for the heating of premises is based on the combustion of solid unprocessed \nbiomass raw (e.g. wood chips and pallets) in boilers with installed capacity of 0.1 to 0.3 MW. The exact \nnumber of potential installations will be determined in the next two calendar years after the preparation \nof the register of hot water boilers in the Albanian territory, as required by the draft law on energy \nefficiency. The National Agency of Natural Resources will start the preparation of such a register within \nthe next two years.\nMost of the waste from agriculture, food processing industry and logging can be processed by being \ntransformed in chips and wood briquettes. Currently, these opportunities are not used due to the high price of chips and the fairly low price of firewood widely used by families. According to estimates, about \none third of apartments in Albania use wood biomass for heating, most of which is crude. This market is \ncontinuously expanding because families refuse to use the expensive services of central heating \ncompanies, which use mainly electricity and LPG.\nMunicipalities with their forests that have proper annual growth to supply the planned capacities, are \nsuitable for the implementation of joint projects. Funding may be provided under contracts for \nguaranteed energy savings under operational programs and the European Union. Owners of forests or \nlarge farms and producers of biomass boilers are eligible participants for the construction of factories for \nthe production of chips and wooden pallets.\nCurrently, Albania has no joint project with other member states regarding the promotion of biomass \nboilers with high energy efficiency. However, suitable technologies from Germany and Austria have just \narrived in the Albanian market.ASSESSMENTS\n3.6 Assessment of the available potential for the development of local renewable \nenergy resources\n3.6.1 Potential of hydropower plants (HPP)\nIt should be noted that in Albania there is still a high hydro-capacity for creating new power generation \ncapacities to be built in the coming years. The following HPP-s are proposed to be considered as new \ncapacities:\n\u2022 About nine medium and large hydropower plants with total installed capacity of 385 MW, including \nHPP of Kalivac.\n\u2022 On Devoll River: HPP of Banja with 65 MW and HPP of Moglic\u00eb with 178 MW \n\u2022 Medium and large HPPs with a total installed capacity of 480 MW\n\u2022 ERE plants with total installed capacity of 30 MW\n\u2022 Photovoltaic plants with total installed capacity of 32 MW\n3.6.2 Concessions for SHPPs\nSince 31 December 2014, the Albanian Government, based on the law \"On concessions\" (adopted in \nDecember 2006), has awarded up to about 120 concession contracts (110 have been already approved \nand 10 are in the final stage of discussion) for the construction of HPP-s of different categories. Annex I \nprovides the total number of concessions, the relevant company, installed capacity, average annual \nproduction and respective investment for each concession contract. To have a clear picture of small \nmedium and large hydropower plants, the total list of HPPs is divided into the following three categories:\n1. One or cascade of SHPPs-with total capacity below 15 MW. Based on the definition of the Decision of \nthe Council of Ministers (DCM), they are considered SHPP;\n2. SHPP-cascade with a total capacity of over 15 MW: Based on the definition of the Decision of Council \nof Ministers (DCM), they as considered as SHPPs;\n3. Medium and large HPP-s and cascade of hydropower plants with a capacity of over 15 MW each: \nBased on the definition of DCM, since each plant has a capacity of over 15 MW, they are not considered \nSHPPs;\nThe analysis shows that the largest number of concessions is related to the first and second group, with a \ntotal of 112 concession contracts included in the category of small hydropower plants. The total installed \ndesigned capacity is 1740 MW and the share of SHPP-s is about 48%, with an installed capacity of 839 \nMW. The new planned capacity of energy constitutes a substantial capacity when compared with the \ncurrent total installed capacity of hydropower plants in Albania (1426 MW). Also, the total planned \ncapacity of SHPP\u2019s of 839 MW is much higher compared to the installed capacity of the existing SHPP-s \n(25 MW) until 2006.\nComparison of estimated annual production of electricity with average annual production of electricity \nfrom existing hydroelectric plants in Albania (4180 GWh) shows that the total potential of electricity \ngeneration is 185% of current production from hydropower plants. The first group can provide 84% of \nthe present average, while groups two and three can produce 45% and 55% of the current electricity \nproduction from hydropower plants.\nRegarding the total investment for each of the aforementioned groups, the analysis shows that total\ndemand for investment is EUR 2 471 million and the share of investment required for small HPPs is about 785 million Euro. Both these values represent significant amounts for the Albanian economy in \ngeneral and its banking sector in particular, making it a very attractive sector.\n3.3.1.9 Operational SHPP: old rehabilitated units and new units\nThe total list of existing operational SHPPs and their production for the first half of 2014 is available\nfrom MEI. In early 2015, the number of the existing operational SHPPs was approximately 90 compared \nto 18 in early 2006.\nThe total list of new operational SHPPs, their total capacity installed is equal to 294.32 MW and their \nproduction for 2014 (equal to 919 GWh).\n3.3.1.10 SHPPs under construction\nThe number of concession contracts for small hydropower plants under construction is approximately 25\nand 8 of them have secured loans, 15 are in the process of negotiation with banks.\n3.7 Energy potential from biomass\nThe usable biomasses for energy purposes may be classified into four main categories: \n\uf0b7 Wood or its remnants from different wood processing industries;\n\uf0b7 Plant residues (stalks, seeds etc) after the completion of their production cycle, which are not \nused in other production sectors;\n\uf0b7 Energy-related agricultural crops (woods) cultivated to be burned as biomass and;\n\uf0b7 Animal residues (bones, skin, manure), which are not used in other economy sectors.\nForests occupy about 36% of the land surface of Albania. Some afforested areas are included in \ncalculations of the land covered with forests, where half of them are classified as groves and shrubs and \nthe other half as forests with high stems/trunks. Almost 4/5 of woods are represented by broad-leaved \nspecies, with dominance of oak and permanently green beech trees.\nAlbania is one of the few European countries that has suffered a decrease in the area covered by forests \nin recent decades, due to cleaning for agriculture purposes, overgrazing and cutting of wood stuff for fuel, \nespecially during the transition period (in around 1990s ). Cutting of trees has exceeded the annual net \ngrowth, which results in decrease of growing stock trees; there was also a decline in its quality as a result \nof illegal logging. Most of the forests are available for the supply of timber; the rest, which is the vast \nmajority, is not available for economic reasons. More than 4/5 of forests are classified as semi-natural, \nwhile the rest is divided into forest without human intervention and plantations. The country developed a \nreforestation program to plant trees, mainly in a difficult terrain, but currently it is downgraded due to \nlack of investment in this field. All forests have been state-owned, but land ownership regime is changing \ncategories, including private and community forests. Currently, 47% of the forest is owned by the \nmunicipalities, about 51% is owned by the state and around 2% is under private ownership. Efforts are \nbeing made to increase the area of protected forest to preserve the rich biodiversity and landscape. \nProtected areas comprise of more than 450 thousand HPPtares, and they will grow as a result of the \ncommitments of the government.\nFrom 2004 to 2012, the surface of Albanian protected areas Albanian has suffered a triple increase.\nDuring the 1990s, and despite the fact that forest management was particularly influenced by the sudden \ncollapse of the previous economy, the forestry sector was not adequately supported. However, the \nproductive capacity of the sector has the potential to be restored, in order to play an important role in \nrural employment, industrial development and environmental protection.Contrary to its unique importance for the economy, the forestry sector continues to suffer from some \ntypical problems of transition: declined investment, weakening of practical forest management, \nmaintenance, lack of supervision and law enforcement. Therefore, the basis of resources has declined \nsubstantially for many years towards the end, not only in terms of quantitative aspects, but also for the \nlarge-scale degradation of forests. Growing of trees per HPPtare is significantly affected, and a large \namount of mature timber can be nowadays found only in physically inaccessible parts of the country. At \nthe same time, economic restructuring has caused a decline in the efficiency of wood cutting and \nprocessing, while illegal cutting have distorted market prices. Also, the local energy policies were not in \nfavor of forests, negatively affecting forest degradation.\nForests all over Albania, especially in mountainous areas, serve as a source of livelihood and income. \nFirstly, the firewood gathered by villagers, not to mention most of the population in urban areas supplied \nwith firewood, which are vital for heating and cooking almost all over the year. Firewood is an important \ncommodity for Albania, because they are used for heating by most households, and in rural areas they are \nalso used for cooking. They now cover 36% of energy demand for heating and 12% of energy for \ncooking. This means that firewood is still indispensable source of energy and will continue to be \nimportant. Larger groups of consumers of firewood are families, but public institutions, manufactuRES\nof charcoal and limestone also consume large volumes of firewood.\nOne of the main problems of the forest sector is the lack of accurate data regarding stock of forests \n(increase, decrease of its surface area and volume etc.). Forest Cadastre continues to not reflect the real \nsituation of national forests. On the other hand, there is no nationwide cadastral office to \nevidence/reflect the relevant changes of land use within the country. Forest area is one of the main forest \nindicators. Over the years, it has undergone some significant changes. It is decreased in absence of a data \nsystem due to the failure to draft management plans for many years, national inventory of forests and \nmaintainance of the system database. For this purpose, an identification project with the support of \nWorld Bank is ongoing. Data presented in the figures below are based on information released by the \n\nThe use of biomass for energy generation in Albania can be obtained from the following sources (Table \n9):\n\u2022 Agricultural waste (stems, seeds etc) after the end of their production cycle, which are not used in other \nproduction sectors;\n\u2022 firewood or wood residues from different wood processing industries;\n\u2022 Energy Plantations (fast growing grove) cultivated to be burned as biomass, and;\n\u2022 The remains of animals (bones, skin, livestock manure) that are not used in other sectors of the \neconomy;\n\u2022 Waste (for instance, food and household waste).\nOlive cultivation is an important industry for the coastal area of Albania. Olive oil extraction is the \nprocess of oil separation from other fruit content (vegetative liquid extract and solid material). Basic steps \nin producing olive oil are always the same and include: 1) cleaning the olives and removing the seeds, \nleaves, buds and other waste; 2) pressing of olives for making a paste and 3) separating the oil from the \nrest of the components of olive oil. Currently, three main methods are applied to extract olive oil: \n\"traditional process\", three-phase process and two-phase process.\nTypes of waste generated: olive mill technology produces a variety of waste, both solid and liquid. Solid \nwaste produced from the extraction of olive oil are alperujo [Spanish] (i.e. pomace remained from the\ntwo-phase system), and orujo [Spanish] (i.e. pomace remained from the three-phase system). Solid waste \nare also generated while pruning olive trees in the olive-grove. These include leaves and small branches \n(after pruning). The leaves can be used as animal feed, fertilizer or compost production, while small \nbranches, pits and dried olive pomace can also be used for energy production. Liquid waste are known as \noil mill sewage and in some cases are used as additives for making cosmetic products and also for bogaz \nas large amounts of non-collected oil and fine residues of pomace remain in the oil mill wastewater \nparticles.\nThe potential uses of pomace are: (i) bio-energy production ; (ii) production of a low-quality oil as a food \nproduct, through a factory chemical process known as \"olive pomace refineries\"; (iii) spread in \nagricultural fields as fertilizers (or mixed with soil for the refilling process, for example in quarries); (iv) \nused as animal feed; and (v) destruction as waste. Energy production (the focus of this project), olive \npomace is directly burned into boilers or transform into pallet or briquette for use in boilers and stoves. \nIn both cases, oil-pomace must be firstly dried.\nRural areas present some features favoring the potential development of an energy chain with olive \npomace because: a) agricultural sector is one of the most important economic activities in rural areas, \nwhich face serious difficulties. The unemployment rate is higher than the national average, especially \namong young people; b) the local community is provided additional economic activity. Community \ndevelopment based on bio industries often involves strengthening community support services, providing \nadditional jobs in the local government bodies and service sectors; c) provides a green label for energy \nusers differentiating it from other competitors; and d) mitigates rural depopulation. Document FGM / \nC.31/5 of FGM Council, together with the United Nations Organization for Industrial Development \n(UNIDO), have established at the Ministry of Environment the project on \"use of olive pomace for \nenergy purposes\", with the aim of facilitating the direction for development with small amounts of carbon \nin agro-farming industry in Albania. Critical factors for the project success are the implementation of \ntechnical solutions adapted to local needs of four industrial sub-sectors in Albania, and the creation of a [54]\nchain of domestic supply, so that piece of equipment are produced at effective cost, building of the \nsystem and costs compliant with the local economy, and the operation and maintenance to be timely and \naffordable. UNIDO experience working with industrial sector in general for small and medium \nenterprises in particular is important for achieving the objectives set out in this project. Moreover, upon \nthe use of pomace as biomass, most of olive oil factories have planned to use a portion of the biomass \n(15-20%) for domestic needs and the rest (80-85%) will be transformed into briquettes / pallet and will \nbe sold for residential buildings, private/public service buildings, as well as for small food processing\nestablishments by applying the latest renewable energy technologies.\nBio-gas use is underdeveloped despite the available resources, so the agricultural biomass from major \nplants will be subsequently calculated in detail, and the biomass to be collected by pruning the main fruit \ntrees.\n\n3.7.1 Solar energy potential\nThe study \u201cSun in Action\u201d6 showed that there is a great potential for solar heating systems, not only for \nthe EU area, but practically worldwide, including participating states in IEA countries. It was also shown \nthat a number of obstacles must be challenged to develop the market for this consolidated technology. In \ngeneral, solar energy market can be described as a market with steady growth and technology placed on \nthe market long time ago. However, some part of the public and commercial sectors continue to be aware \nof these facts and are astonished by short-term profit objectives. Therefore, industries, public and private \nhousing companies and public utilities, account for only a small portion of the users of installations for \nsolar heating systems. The aim of this analysis is to describe the potential of water heating with solar \nenergy and the expected market growth, as well as the main obstacles, in order to highlight opportunities \nto spread the use of solar heating energy market and housing sector. There have been a number of recent \nimportant market development studies and potential of solar energy systems. All these studies have \nreached the same result: The market is very large and, taken as a whole; it is growing steadily, although \ngrowth performance largely varies from state to state. These studies show that the potential of solar \ncollectors for the housing sector and district heating sector can be easily expressed as a very significant \nfigure: 0.5 to 1.0 m2 solar collectors per capita\nThe minimum value represents warmer climates and high value the climates of Northern Europe and \nCentral Europe. Studies also show that the number in question could go to 1 m2 solar collector per capita \nin countries with warm climate. In Albania there are excellent conditions for water heating by solar energy \nheating systems. Annual solar radiation is high and could theoretically provide to Albania adequate\nheating water at low temperature over a period of at least (7-8) months. The regime of solar radiation and \nannual sunshine hours in Albania are shown in Figures 15 and 16.\nSolar collector systems available in Albanian markets rely on electricity as additional energy, especially \nduring the period from November to March. Also, it is worth noting that the demand for energy for \nheating water in a family of 4 people is approximately 2,500 kWh /year. The need for additional energy \ncan be reduced by installing more effective solar panels, but as a result it will increase the surplus of solar \nenergy from April to September.\nAs noted from the charts, for an average efficiency of 55% of solar systems, NUED systems can provide \nup to 68% of the energy demand for water heating in Peshkopi, which goes up to 86% in Saranda.\nMEI during the period 2009-2015, assisted by the program of FGM / UNDP \"Global initiative to \ntransform and strengthen the market for the use of solar energy for water heating: Program for Albania\", \nMEI has taken over many tasks, particularly with regard to monitoring systems for solar heating installed \nso far in Albania and assessment of the future market for households, dwellings and public and private \nservices, as well as for a number of industry sub-sectors.\n \n\nWind energy is used for pumping water, windmills and in recent decades the focus is shifted on the \nproduction of electricity. Machinery operated by wind energy have an installed capacity varying from\nseveral [kW] to 5 [MW] and are being used successfully in isolated areas. Wind energy is a substantial\npotential as an energy resource and is uniformly distributed all over the world. Windmills can be quickly \ninstalled and use a small area of land. In most countries, windmill installations face a common concern, \nlack of continuous measurement of wind velocity and lack of permanent wind.\nSHPEJTESIAMESTARE VJETORE E ERES (m/sek)\nLegjenda\nFigure 21: Division into areas as per the number of annual hours of wind per average value of wind velocity.\nTherefore, various companies wishing to invest in this sector can hardly decide whether it is worth \ninvesting in a particular region without these necessary data. Data obtained from different metrological \nstations in Albania are conservative/approximate and not very reliable because they are not gathered with\nthe specific purpose of measuring wind energy (table 14 and figure 21).\nThere are big plans for wind energy development in Albania in the coming years with significant \ninvestments, with a total of licensed windmills at a capacity of 1300 MW (Table 14) (licenses issued until \n2010).\n\n\nAvailability of eolic park or load factor - the percentage of time during which the wind turbines are able \nto work at full-load is universally regarded as the biggest problem for wind energy. Uncertainty about the \namount to be produced by an eolic park is a real challenge. The methodology of forecasting and \nestimating wind sources are tasks of the experts. The average annual wind measurements between 5,8 m/ \ns to 7 m /s in the requested areas are promising. The table below can show load factors typically varying \nfrom 22% to 25%.\nLicenses continued to be granted during the period 2010-2014 and by the end of December 2014 their \ntotal in Albania roughly amounted to 2548 MW, based on the information provided by the Ministry of \nEnergy and Industry, with power generation potential of about 5 TWh / year. Albanian power system \ncapacity to transmit and absorb wind energy is estimated to approximately 180-200 MW.\nA balanced approach is required since the wind is an energy resource of low probability. The combination \nof wind and hydric resources is a good option. Hydro-plants can be commissioned at any time, therefore \nit is an excellent balancer of wind power plants.[60]\n\nThere are a variety of geothermal resources, which can be classified into: hydrothermal springs, streams of\nhot water and molten rocks. Of these three groups, to date only hydrothermal resources have been\npractically used in Albania. Most of the time, hydrothermal sources are geothermal energy resources that \nproduce hot water and are used in some countries for heating of various facilities.\nA new technique of using geothermal energy is the injection of cold water in deep wells of oil and natural\ngas, which are already no longer used for heating. Water is injected at a temperature of (7-8) \u00b0 C and\ncomes to the surface at a temperature of (22-25) \u00b0 C. In Albania there is little hope to produce steam\nfrom geothermal sources, but there are several hydrothermal sources at a low temperature (Table 16).[61]\n\nThe most important geothermal resources explored to date in Albania are as follows:\n\uf0b7 Geothermal surface of Kruja, which is the area with the largest geothermal resources in Albania, \nwith a surface area of 18 km length and 4,5 km width, containing reserves within a range of \n5.9x108-5.1x109 GJ.\n\uf0b7 Geothermal area of Ardenica, where water comes out from the depth at a temperature of 32-38 \noC and flowing at surface with an intake of 15-18 l/s.\n\uf0b7 Geothermal area of Peshkopi, where there are a number of geothermal sources located next to \neach other. Water intake is around 14-17 l/s and temperature is 35-43,5 oC.\n3.7.9 RER input to power generation\nIn order to better prepare the implementation of Directive 2009/28/EC, similarly to all EU members \nand other Contracting Parties of CoE Treaty, Albania has conducted an assessment of the potential \navailable for the development of renewable energy resources for power generation. Table 10, along with \ntables 1 and 3 of the National Action Plan for Renewable Energies, are used as a structure to sum up the \nmain findings. \nFor the energy sector, the projected installed capacity (accumulated) (in MW) and annual production \n(GWh) are shown as per each individual technology. As for the hydric sector, a distinction is made \nbetween the plants at an installed capacity of less than 1 MW, between 1 and 10 MW and above 10 MW. \nDetails for solar energy are given separately for the inputs from power plants with photovoltaic solar \npanels and those with solar energy heating systems. Data on wind energy in the sea (onshore) and on the \nground (offshore) are presented separately. As for the biomass used for electricity, a distinction needs to \nbe made between the solid, gaseous and liquid biomass (tables 17.a and 17.b). Figure 22 introduces the \npower supply provision under this study, based on different and updated studies. Furthermore, the \nrelevant cover for each plant (including RESplants) is given in Figures 22-26.[62]\n\nFeed-in tariffs for wind power plants\nFor many REStechnologies in general and wind power plants in particular, specific costs of energy\ngeneration in MWh vary according to the plant size; this is typical for small and large wind turbines etc. \nAlmost all EU candidate and non-candidate countries apply feed-in tariffs at different levels of\nremuneration, mainly based on the plant size within these technologies. By applying this approach, due \naccount can be taken of the low/high energy generation costs due to scale economies / non-economies. \nThe range of prices can be too high for different capacities installed. Figure 1 introduces a comparison of\nwind power plants in different countries and according to different sizes.\nFigure 27.: Comparison of feed-in tariffs for wind power plants for different countries and different sizes (\u20ac cent/kWh)\nThe projects of wind power plants require high initial investments; therefore CAPEX projection is highly \ncritical. Figure 2 introduces the results for feed-in tariffs for wind power plants, based on the average \nfeed-in tariffs (retrieved from figure 1) for installations of wind power plants at a higher capacity. \nFigure 28.: Comparison of feed-in tariffs for wind power plants for different countries and average capacities (\u20ac cent/kWh)For a number of REStechnologies in general and PV plants in particular, the specific costs of power \ngeneration per MWh vary as per the plant size. This is typical for PV plants, solar power plants, biomass \nand biogas, geothermal plants, small wind power plants etc. Almost all EU candidate and non-candidate \ncountries apply feed-in tariffs at different compensation rates, mainly on the basis of plant size within \nthese technologies. By applying this approach, due account can be taken of the low/high power \nproduction costs, due to scale economies/non-economies. The range of prices may be too high. In \nGermany, for solar power plants with a capacity between 500 kW and 5 MW, the tariff level varies from \n130 to 80 \u20ac/MWh, while the United Kingdom falls within another extreme category, with a feed-in tariff\nstarting from 61 \u20ac/MWh for 5 MW up to270 \u20ac/MWh for 15 kW plants. Figure 3 introduces a \ncomparison of feed-in tariffs for PV solar power plants for different countries and plant sizes.\n"}
