dynamic developments\nin Albania\u2019 energy sector During this period,  number of framework laws and\nregulations were drafted and adopted, the electricity sector was going under\nimportant structural, legal, tariff reforms, and the oil and gas sector was\nsubject to important developments Also, during this period, Albania has\ncontinued to implement its obligations and commitments towards regional\nintegration through the Energy Community and it has taken on new international\ncommitments and initiatives, including in relation to climate action All of\nthese activities have served as  foundation for development of this National\nEnergy Strategy The Strategy represents  synthesis of detailed energy sector\nanalysis, and other sectoral and cross- sectoral strategic and planning\ndocuments, much of which was incorporated into an analytical review of future\ndevelopment pathways for Albania\u2019 energy sector Many of the key documents\nreferenced in this Strategy were still under review during this period, and the\nstrategy represents the most current information on these documents as of early\n2018, and an analytical review of future development pathways for Albania\u2019\nenergy sector As  complex and multidimensional process, this Energy Sector\nStrategy has been guided by the political leadership of the Ministry of\nInfrastructure and Energy, supported by  Working Group, established with\nparticipation of the Ministry\u2019 key Departments, ERE, AKBN, power utilities\n(KESH, OST and OSHEE) and oil and gas companies like ALBPETROL, ARMO, ALBGAS\nThis Working Group coordinated the process for drafting the National Strategy\nfor the Energy Sector and was closely supported by USAID with technical\nexpertise1 from USAID\u2019 strategic team, composed of leading experts in the fields\nof electricity, oil and gas, renewables, energy efficiency and strategic energy\nplanning As announced at the Energy Community Ministerial Council meeting on 14\nDecember 2017, the Republic of Albania will engage, in cooperation with the\nSecretariat of the Energy Community, in elaborating and adopting an Integrated\nEnergy and Climate Plan in the course of This Plan will complement the present\nStrategy, and will address the five mutually reinforcing and interrelated\ndimensions2, adapted in the context of Albania, to bring greater energy\nsecurity, sustainability and competitiveness The five mutually supportive\ndimensions are:  Energy security, based on energy sources diversification,\nsolidarity and trust;  Fully integration into the regional and subsequently\nEuropean market;  Energy efficiency contributing to moderation of demand;  The\nUSAID\u2019 technical assistance was provided in the framework of the regional\nprogram \u201cEnhancing Capacity for Low Emissions Development Strategies (EC-LEDS)\nFive dimensions of the Energy Union set out in the European Commission'\nCommunication of 25 February 2015 CONTEXT & CURRENT CONDITIONS PAGE  ENERGY\nSTRATEGY FOR ALBANIA  Decarbonizing the economy;  Research, innovation and\ncompetitiveness; METHOD FOR DEVELOPING THE STRATEGY  The principles guiding the\ndevelopment of this strategy are fully in line with the principles of the Second\nNational Strategy for Development and Integration, and their goals are to: \uf0b7\nIncrease the security of energy supply while ensuring sustainable development\nand providing affordable energy costs for Albanian citizens and the economy; \uf0b7\nFurther diversification of supply sources and interconnection with the regional\nand European electricity and gas networks \uf0b7 Establish  competitive and organized\nmarket that provides correct signals for production and consumption of\nelectricity and natural gas, considering the specific influence of climate\nchanges on the domestic power production; \uf0b7 Couple the electricity market in\nline with the commitments made under the so-called Berlin process3; \uf0b7 Ensure\nthat the climate change targets are met, including the renewable energy resource\n(RES) and energy efficiency targets The analysis of the Albanian Energy Sector\nwas performed using the Albania-LEAP4 model,  proven tool used previously by the\nAlbanian Government and commonly used by other countries in the region and\nglobally The analytical results provided quantitative metrics for assessing the\nlikely outcomes of possible energy scenarios against the strategic goals of this\nstrategy The assessment of the institutional reform priorities was developed in\nconsultation with  large variety of stakeholders inside and out of the\ngovernment aiming to discuss the key policy and legislative instruments driving\nenergy sector reform in Albania and identify actions to meet the legal\nrequirements and political commitments For the Power Sector, the discussions\nincluded the Electricity Market Model, creating an Agency for Energy Efficiency,\ndeveloping an Energy Efficiency Fund in accordance with the Energy Efficiency\nLaw, and other priorities such as the development of secondary legislation for\nimplementing the Power Sector, Oil & Natural Gas, RES and EPB Laws Discussions\nregarding the oil and gas sector included the role of key institutions and\nreforms needed to modernize the sector and prepare the proper institutions and\nentities for  potential gasification of the economy Particular attention was\ngiven to the need for capacity building and restructuring of Albanian energy\ninstitutions and energy public companies  The Berlin Process is  diplomatic\ninitiative linked to the future enlargement of the European Union The Berlin\nProcess is an intergovernmental cooperation initiative aimed at revitalizing the\nmultilateral ties between the Western Balkans and selected EU member states, and\nat improving regional cooperation in the Western Balkans on the issues of\ninfrastructural and economic development  Long-range Energy Alternatives\nPlanning System (LEAP) CONTEXT & CURRENT CONDITIONS PAGE  ENERGY STRATEGY FOR\nALBANIA The need for continuation of the electricity tariff reform was assessed,\nincluding the importance that such  reform has on the creating the right\nincentives for electricity market participants The chapters on incentives for\nenergy efficiency investment and introducing Contract for Difference (as support\nscheme) for RES electricity generation were based on  comparative assessment of\nbest practices in the old and new EU Member States Analysis of how well Albanian\nlegislation aligns with the EU energy acquis was based on independent\nassessments of Albania\u2019 status,  by the Energy Community Secretariat, and\nthrough discussions with sector experts in Albania The assessment of the\npotential for integration into the regional/EU energy market was based on\nresearch into regional market plans and discussions with local experts regarding\nthe Albania\u2019 competitive position in these markets  ALIGNMENT WITH OTHER KEY\nDOCUMENTS Albania\u2019 Energy Sector Strategy is harmonized in terms of goals,\nenergy sector details and timeline with  number of other strategic and legal\ndocuments that are in force, adopted or drafted in the same time frame as this\ndocument Building on and complementing these documents has led to

Ministry of Energy and Industry,\ntogether with all other energy stakeholders, are working to fulfill their\ncommitments to implement the Third Energy Package In addition, Albania had the\nfirst gas transmission system operator, TAP AG, certified under Third Energy\nPackage procedures, which has laid the groundwork for development of  gas market\nvia the Trans Adriatic Pipeline ERE also certified the second gas transmission\nsystem operator, Albgaz, on  Nov 2017 The new Power Sector Law transposing the\nThird Energy Package in the electricity sector was adopted in April 2015 and\nentered into force on 13 June draft Law on some amendments of the Power Sector\nLaw is currently in the process of being approved in the Parliament, which will\ncreate the legal basis for the establishment of the Albanian Power Exchange and\nmarket coupling with Kosovo Following the obligations stipulated therein, the\nEnergy Regulatory Entity (ERE) and the Ministry of Energy and Industry started\nthe process of harmonizing the secondary legislation required for the reforms\nand liberalization of the electricity market In March 2017, ERE approved the\nfinal certification of the ownership unbundling of the electricity system\noperator, OST The electricity market reforms will go beyond the implementation\nof the Third Energy Package inside the country Albania is  member of the Berlin\nprocess or Western Balkans Six (WB6) initiative and has committed to regional\nelectricity market integration as an intermediary step toward  European\nelectricity target model Further, as  part of WB6 initiative Albania has\ncommitted to climate action In July 2016, the Council of Ministers adopted  new\nmarket model for the regulation of Albania\u2019 electricity market The Council also\nadopted  plan to phase-out price regulation and to enable all market\nparticipants to freely trade on the market An action plan for setting up  power\nexchange, which envisages an organized day-ahead market in the second half of\n2017, was also part of this package The market model envisages the coupling of\nthe Albanian market with the Kosovo market and other neighboring countries By\ncommissioning the new 400 kV interconnection line with Kosovo in June 2016,\nAlbania took  further step towards its regional electricity market integration\nThe two system operators have already developed and tested  mechanism for\nprocurement of capacity for secondary reserve The Power Sector Law of 2015 is in\nline with the Third Energy Package and transposes Directive 2009/EC and\nRegulation (EC)  Implementation of the

FOR ALBANIA 714/However, the secondary legislation is yet to be\nadopted, thus delaying the implementation of the Third Energy Package Over the\nyears, Albpetrol has transformed itself from  fully operational oil company\ntowards the role of an agency with no active involvement in upstream oil and gas\noperations, while retaining huge number of the employees on its payroll At\npresent Albpetrol' primary source of revenue is the overriding royalties or\nshare of profit it obtains from private oil and gas companies These are\nfunctions that should be performed by  government agency, rather than Albpetrol\nHence, Albania today has, in effect, two government agencies overseeing the oil\nand gas sector, with the more appropriate agency for this role (AKBN) having\nbeen substantially weakened The other players in Albania' upstream market are\nprivate companies that have obtained rights over existing oil and gas fields as\nwell as new exploration and production Albania' ad-hoc licensing approach has\nresulted in  predominance of small companies operating in Albania Rather than\nfocusing on company size, the criteria the Albanian government should use for\nassessing potential investors should be the qualifications and experience of\ncompanies in the oil and gas industry, supplemented by  competitive process for\nlicense access The time would appear to be right for Albania to shift course and\ninvite investors to bid for licenses on  competitive basis  STATUS OF ENERGY\nSECTOR ALIGNMENT WITH EU ACQUIS In line with its obligations under the Energy\nCommunity and as part of Albania\u2019 strategic objective to accede to the EU, the\nGovernment has worked to align its legislation with the legal framework of the\nEU, and aims to establish clear and transparent responsibilities for the\nimplementation of EU Acquis The relevant primary legislation includes the Power\nSector Law No 43, the Natural Gas Sector Law No 102, the Energy Efficiency Law\nNo 124, the Renewable Energy Sources Law No /2017, the Law No 68 \u201cOn Information\nof the Consumption of Energy and Other Resources by Energy-Related Products\u201d,\nand the Law on Energy Performance of Buildings No 116/In line with the EU\nlegislation and the EC Treaty, the Albanian Government has developed and adopted\nthe respective National Action Plans for Energy Efficiency and RES Also, the\nnational energy regulatory authority (ERE) already issued  significant set of\nsecondary regulatory acts However, important regulations and secondary\nlegislation, which are necessary for the full application of these laws, have\nyet to be developed, and the Government and ERE should continue to develop and\nimplement regulations and secondary legislation for energy efficiency and\nrenewable energy sources; improve strategic planning for physical capacities,\nfinancial requirements and budgetary implications of the energy sector; ensure\nthat the goals of loss reduction and full bill collection are completed by\nOShEE; ensure unbundling of OShEE and speed up the implementation of the energy\nacquis considering that faster implementation will facilitate much needed\ninvestments and influence the local market towards sustainable energy objectives\nNear-term priorities for the future include developing secondary legislation and\nregulations for implementing the Law on Energy Performance of Buildings, the Law\non Energy Efficiency, amending the Power Sector Law and adoption of the\nsecondary legislation for establishing and functioning of the Albanian Power\nExchange, the electricity market coupling with Kosovo and other neighboring\ncountries, developing and adoption of the secondary legislation for\nimplementation of the RES law, and developing and approving  specific regulation\ntransposing the EU Regulation no347 on guidelines for Trans- European Energy\nInfrastructure  special attention will be devoted to the implementation of

products and the law no8450, dated\n1999 \u201cOn refining, transportation and trading of oil and its byproducts\u201d as\namended Considering that the energy sector is one of the key sectors with  large\nimpact on the climate change, the Albanian Government is planning to finalize\nsoon  new draft Law on Climate Change, which will serve as  legal basis for\nsetting  more detailed framework for climate actions and clear competences and\nresponsibilities for Ministry and other subordinated agencies responsible for\nenergy sector and Ministry of Tourism and Environment The draft Law on Climate\nChange, which will sets the framework for climate actions, is under development\nand is expected to be adopted by middle of  ENERGY SECTOR CHALLENGES Since 1992,\nthe Albanian economy has experienced  transformation from  centralized to\nmarket economy The GDP per capita value has increased in the last two decades\ndue to  number of factors, including an ambitious program for the economic\ndevelopment, development support offered by donors, and  favorable geographic\nposition as  bridge that connects the Balkans with Western Europe The challenges\ncurrently facing the Albanian energy sector include: \uf0b7 Meeting the economic\ndevelopments in different sectors and the growing level of energy consumption\nper capita; \uf0b7 Improving the trend of energy intensity reduction; \uf0b7 Enhancing\nsecurity of energy supply by improving energy efficiency, increasing the share\nof renewables and other indigenous energy sources, and increasing regional\ncooperation and integration Historically, Albania\u2019 energy consumption per capita\nis very low, which indicates low levels of economic activity as well as modest\nlevels of comfort in the household and service sectors On the other hand, energy\nintensity, which is the ratio of primary energy supply in  given year and GDP\nproduced in the same year, has been very high The reasons are the same as for\nthe other Central and Eastern European countries: Albanian industry had been\norientated towards energy intensive industries such as mining and metallurgy,\nand energy prices were kept at relatively low levels Thus, one of Albania\u2019 most\ncrucial challenges is how to increase the low per capita energy consumption\nwhile at the same time reducing the high level of energy intensity in order to\nhave an efficient economy that will compete in the domestic and foreign markets\nThe challenges related to energy security include meeting the country\u2019 demand\nfor crude oil with domestic production in decline The total primary energy\ndemand cannot be met with domestic energy sources They have continuously\ndeclined during the period , with the self-sufficiency of primary energy sources\ndeclining from 97% in 1990 to approximately % in Thus, it is clear that meeting\nthe country\u2019 energy demand requires further development of domestic resources as\nwell as liberalization and integration in the regional market In addition to the\nchallenges above, three future challenges for the Albanian energy system are to\nreach the RES target in 2020 and beyond, the EE target for reduction in final\nenergy use, and the NDC target for GHG emission reductions These energy sector\nchallenges are compounded by the uncertainty in energy and economic indicators,\nthe lack of an appropriate and effective infrastructure to collect data, and the\nlack of development strategies in some sectors CONTEXT & CURRENT CONDITIONS PAGE\nENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA The final challenge is management of the transition\nto the new market model, including the protection of vulnerable customers\nCONTEXT & CURRENT CONDITIONS PAGE  ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA  STRATEGIC\nVISION, POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES This National Energy Sector Strategy contains\nthe following Vision for 2030: Development of domestic energy sources, leading\nto  regional integrated and diversified energy system based on market\nprinciples, able to meet demand for energy and for sustainable development of\nthe economy, ensuring security and quality of supply, safety, environmental\nprotection and climate action, and increased welfare  STRATEGIC CONTEXT The\nEnergy Strategy for Albania  is the core strategic document for the country\u2019\nenergy sector It is consistent with the national efforts to sustain economic\ndevelopment, and meet commitments to the Energy Community, EU integration and\nother international agreements, while increasing the security of energy supply\nand minimizing environmental impacts with affordable costs for Albanian citizens\nand the economy The Energy Sector Strategy is developed in accordance with the\nNational Strategy for Development and Integration II (NSDI - II), and it is the\nsector strategy that will guide the policy-making at high levels of the public\ninstitutions, as well as the private sector The Energy Sector Strategy is part\nof the Integrated Planning System (IPS) and is intended to be an important\nreference document that will enable development partners to align their\ndevelopment and cooperation strategies and programs with Albania\u2019 priorities and\nframework for development and EU integration The Energy Sector Strategy was\nprepared in compliance with the requirements of Article () of Power Sector Law\n(Law no43, date 2015) and with the support of the USAID Enhancing Capacity for\nLow Emission Development Strategies (EC-LEDS) program, which is part of\nworldwide efforts to address climate change and promote transitions to low-\ncarbon economies The national energy-sector strategy is designed to meet the\ndevelopment needs of the country and provide its citizens/consumers with\nstable, reliable and affordable energy supply based on the regional integration\nand diversification of the energy sector  GUIDING PRINCIPLES The principles\nguiding the development of this energy strategy are consistent with the goals of\nthe NSDI \u2013 II, specifically to: \uf0b7 Increase the security of energy supply with\naffordable costs for Albanian citizens and the economy; \uf0b7 Further development of\ndomestic energy sources, and diversification of supply sources and\ninterconnection with the regional Energy Community and European electricity and\ngas networks \uf0b7 Establish  competitive market that provides correct signals for\nproduction and consumption of electricity and gas; \uf0b7 Provide incentives for\nimplementing the necessary climate action policies, such as reaching renewable\nenergy resource (RES) and energy efficiency targets and for decreasing adverse\nenvironmental impacts STRATEGIC VISION, POLICIES & OBJECTIVES PAGE 10 ENERGY\nSTRATEGY FOR ALBANIA The following long-term strategic objectives were\nidentified to actualize the Guiding Principles and the current commitments that\nhave been undertaken by the Albanian government \uf0b7 Improving the reliability and\nsecurity of energy supply; \uf0b7 Developing the domestic primary energy sources in\nsustainable and competitive manner \uf0b7 Improving the cost-effectiveness of energy\nsupply systems; \uf0b7 Achieving the targets for renewable energy sources and energy\nefficiency established in the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plans and\nthe National Renewable Energy Action Plan; \uf0b7 Developing least-cost and\nsustainable policy for residential heating and cooling \uf0b7 Integrating the\nAlbanian power and natural gas markets with regional Energy Community and\nEuropean markets; and \uf0b7 Achieving the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)\ntargets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions  POLICY SCENARIOS The key\npolicies impacting the Energy Sector and related climate actions in Albania\ninclude policies needed to: \uf0b7 Meet the current commitments to the Energy\nCommunity for energy efficiency and renewable energy implementation, and the\ncountry\u2019 GHG reduction commitment under the Paris Accords and other climate\nactions policies as part of WB6 commitments, \uf0b7 Prepare for  possible natural gas\nmarket within Albania, and \uf0b7 Better integrate with the EU and regional markets,\nwith  specific focus on efforts for coupling the Albanian and Kosovo electricity\nmarkets as  first step toward regional market coupling To understand the costs\nand benefits of these possible policies, the following six scenarios were\ndeveloped and analyzed using the Albania-LEAP6 model \uf0b7 Baseline Scenario: This\nrepresents the most likely evolution of the Albanian energy sector with no any\nfurther policy interventions This scenario is the base for comparison with the\npolicy scenarios below \uf0b7 Energy Efficiency (EE): This scenario assumes that\nAlbania meets its Energy Community Treaty commitments by implementing the second\nNational Energy Efficiency Action Plan and enforces the Law on Energy Efficiency\n(together with improvement of the Law to transpose EED requirements) and the Law\non Energy Performance in Buildings  Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning\nSystem (LEAP) STRATEGIC VISION, POLICIES & OBJECTIVES PAGE 11 ENERGY STRATEGY\nFOR ALBANIA \uf0b7 Renewable Energy Sources (RES): Assumes that Albania meets its\nEnergy Community Treaty commitments of reaching  38% renewable energy target in\n2020 by implementing the Albanian National Renewable Energy Action Plan \uf0b7\nNatural Gas Promotion: Assumes maximum possible penetration of natural gas in\nline with the Gas

Focused activities regarding the use, remediation or\nremoval of existing non efficient energy infrastructure that adversely impacts\nenvironment and potentially high value areas for other development sectors,\ntourism, agriculture, etc The results of the detailed analysis show that the\nmost beneficial scenario for the Albanian energy sector, based on the strategic\nmetrics, would be to implement all the measures from the EE, RES and Albania-\nKosovo electricity market coupling scenarios along with the power and industry\nsector components of STRATEGIC VISION, POLICIES & OBJECTIVES PAGE 12 ENERGY\nSTRATEGY FOR ALBANIA the Natural Gas Promotion scenario Removing the gas\ninfrastructure investment required to enable gas access to residential and\ncommercial customers would improve outcomes, presenting an optimal scenario for\nthe development of the Albanian energy sector till The recommended development\nscenario has the potential to achieve the following results, which in many cases\nexceed the commitments made by the country: \uf0b7 Potential to reduce energy imports\nby 32% compared to the Baseline scenario; \uf0b7 Potential to increase the RES share\npast 2020 by focusing the gas infrastructure investment to provide gas access to\nthe power and industry sectors and not residential and commercial customers; \uf0b7\nPotential to reduce final energy demand by %, , close to the NEEAP target; \uf0b7\nPotential to reduce GHG emissions by 28% compared to the Baseline scenario; \uf0b7\nPotential to reduce electricity generation requirements by at least 31%, and \uf0b7\nPotential to reduce the Energy Intensity of GDP by 18% \uf0b7 Potential to increase\npenetration of the TAP\u2019 natural gas in Albanian primary energy supply from 36%\nin 2015 to the 81% in 2030  OTHER POLICIES & OBJECTIVES Implementing this Energy\nStrategy will increase the security of Albania\u2019 energy supply and begin to\nintegrate the Albanian energy market into regional, the Energy Community and the\nEuropean markets This Strategy supports the country\u2019 overall economic\ndevelopment goals, and is based on an optimal energy scenario that balances\nnational interests with those of the different energy sub-sectors In addition,\nthe strategy is designed to support social development goals, by increasing\nemployment through promotion of the green energy sector, stimulating competition\nin the Albanian energy market, ensuring supply stability by moving towards\nregional markets, increasing the welfare for energy consumers, and minimizing\nadverse impacts to the environment Albania has signed the Paris Agreement on the\n22nd of April 2016 in New York, entering in the new era of the climate\ninternational policy process In fact, Albania joined the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995, and the Kyoto Protocol\nin Albania has started the process of changing the status from  developing\ncountry to  developed country, in the context of the UNFCCC This process is an\nintegral part of the process of integration into the European Union and involves\nthe development of capacities at the national level for monitoring and annual\nreporting of Greenhouse Gases (GHG), the formulation and implementation of\npolicies to reduce GHG and climate change adaptation, transposition and\nimplementation of the European Union acquis on climate change In line with the\nobjectives of the EU -20, Albania has submitted its National Determined\nContribution within the Paris Agreement process in September 2015, committing\nitself to reduce CO2 emissions compared to the baseline scenario in the period\nof 2016 and 2030 by % The level of National Determined Contribution will be\nreviewed and further elaborated upon in the Integrated Energy and Climate Plan\nto be developed and adopted in STRATEGIC VISION, POLICIES & OBJECTIVES PAGE 13\nENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA  ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MAIN PRODUCTS  APPROACH TO\nANALYSIS OF ALBANIAN ENERGY SECTOR SCENARIOS The analysis of future development\npathways for the Albania energy sector was performed using the Albania-LEAP\nmodel,  proven tool used previously by the Albanian Government and commonly used\nby other countries in the region and globally The Albania-LEAP model was\nupdated, calibrated to the 2014 energy balance and updated to 2015 and 2016\nenergy data where available, and extended to 2030 for this analysis, as\ndocumented in the Analysis Report7  Baseline scenario, which represents\nbusiness as usual approach to the energy sector, was developed based on the\nfollowing data and assumptions: () (ii) The base year was calibrated to the\nofficial 2014 national energy balance, and relevant 2015 data was considered as\nit became available Future projections of energy demand are consistent with the\nbaselines used in the NREAP and NEEAP analyses (iii) Follows economic\ndevelopment objectives of the second National Strategy for Development and\nIntegration (NSDI-II) (iv) Current structure of energy supply and demand in all\neconomic sectors remains similar to the base year ()  continued prevalent use of\nelectrical energy for heating and warm water in residential and the service\nsector (vi)  significant portion of future demand for electricity will be met\nthrough new hydropower plants and new thermal generation based on imported\nnatural gas (vii) The planned short-term measures from the national action plans\non Renewable Energy Sources and Energy Efficiency will not be strictly\nimplemented (viii) National energy intensity will decrease only slightly from\n2014-The Baseline scenario serves as the reference for comparing each of the\nenergy strategy scenarios that will look to accomplish specific policy goals The\nEnergy Efficiency scenario is based on Albania\u2019 commitments under the Energy\nCommunity Treaty, the 2015 law on Energy Efficiency (No 124), and the new law on\nEnergy Performance in Buildings The EE scenario also assumes that Albania\nimplements the second NEEAP The scenario includes 14 specific measures needed to\nincrease energy efficiency in both supply and demand  Analysis of

STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA The Renewable\nEnergy scenario is based on Albania\u2019 obligations as  Contracting Party to the\nEnergy Community Treaty to comply with EU Directives on the promotion of\nrenewable energy sources One of the directive\u2019 requirements is the preparation\nand adoption of  National Renewable Energy Plan (NREAP) The RE scenario\nincorporates Albania\u2019 NREAP, which calls for increase the portion of renewables\nto 38 percent of the total final energy consumption by 2020, which should be\nfurther developed by The Natural Gas Promotion scenario calculates how much\nnatural gas could penetrate in the different demand sectors (residential,\nservice, industry, transport and agriculture) as well as power generation This\nscenario assesses the costs and benefits of accessing natural gas from the Trans\nAdriatic Natural Gas Pipeline The Albania-Kosovo Coupling scenario assesses the\nimpacts of integrating the operation of the electricity markets in Albania and\nKosovo as  first step towards  regional coupled electricity market This project,\nwhich is  Project of Mutual Interest, would have the following benefits: \uf0b7\nReduced electricity system costs through more efficient utilization of cross-\nborder capacity between Albania and Kosovo \uf0b7 Improved security of electricity\nsupply, especially given existing problems with blackouts and in some cases of\nload shedding \uf0b7 Greater utilization of the existing generation capacities and\nimproved generating diversity \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 Improved power system control and system\nreserve by combining thermal (base) generation in Kosovo and hydropower (peak)\ncapacities in Albania Improved regional integration of Albania\u2019 power market\nthat could lead to further market coupling in line with the WB  commitments\nImproved competition and market efficiency due to increased market size The\nfollowing strategic metrics were selected because of their relationship to the\nlong-term strategic objectives Each metrics is the change from the Baseline\nscenario for the following model outputs: \uf0b7 Percentage of renewable energy\nutilization; \uf0b7 Reduction in energy-related CO2 emissions; \uf0b7 Level of final\nenergy consumption, \uf0b7 Level of electricity generation; and \uf0b7 Level of\nutilization of cross-border capacity; \uf0b7 Fraction of energy

Natural Gas Promotion scenario by removing the\ngas infrastructure investment required to serve residential and commercial\ncustomers The recommended development scenario is considered the most beneficial\nbecause it has the potential to achieve the following results: \uf0b7 Potential to\nreduce the energy imports by 32% compared to the Baseline scenario \uf0b7 Potential\nto reach the RES target past 2020 by including the gas infrastructure investment\nto serve the power and industry sectors and not at the middle terms to the\nresidential and commercial customers; \uf0b7 Potential to reduce the final energy\ndemand by %, compared to the Baseline scenario; \uf0b7 Potential to reduce the GHG\nemissions by 28% compared to the Baseline scenario; \uf0b7 Potential to reduce the\nelectricity generation requirements by at least 31%, and \uf0b7 Potential that\nnatural gas to penetrate up to 81% of the total primary energy source by 2030; \uf0b7\nPotential to reduce the reduce the energy intensity of GDP by 18% Implementing\nthis Energy Strategy will increase the security of Albania\u2019 energy supply and\nbegin to integrate the Albanian energy market into regional and European markets\nThis Strategy is based on an optimal energy scenario that balances national\ninterests with those of the different energy sub-sectors In addition, the\nstrategy is designed to

power sector reforms include: ANALYSIS OF POLICIES\n& MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 23 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA \uf0b7 The Energy Community\nTreaty (\u201cECT\u201d), ratified by the Albanian Parliament with Law No9501, dated 2006,\nwhich provides  legal framework for convergence with the European Union\u2019 (\u201cEU\u201d)\nenergy acquis8; \uf0b7 Law No 43 \u201cOn Power Sector\u201d, which was approved by the\nAlbanian Parliament in April 2015; \uf0b7 New Market Model for the Albanian\nelectricity sector, which was approved by the Council of Ministers Decision no\n519, dated 2016; \uf0b7 Decision of ERE no214, dated 2017 \u201cOn approval of Albanian\nElectricity Market Rules and Participation Agreement in the Day Ahead Market\u201d; \uf0b7\nLaw No 124 \u201cOn Energy Efficiency\u201d, which was approved in November 2015; \uf0b7 Law No\n/2017 \u201cOn Renewable Energy Sources\u201d, which was approved by the Albanian\nParliament in February  ECT AND POWER SECTOR LAW As  signatory to the ECT, much\nof Albania\u2019 energy sector legislation and regulation is guided by requirements\nof the EU\u2019 Internal Energy Market Specifically, the ECT sets out  number of\nacquis, which comprises core EU legislation in the energy sector More details on\nthe component parts of the acquis that are relevant to the power sector are\ndescribed in the Technical Annex Law No 43 \u201cOn Power Sector\u201d was approved in\n2015, with the primary objective of moving towards alignment with the EU acquis\non electricity The key reform actions and the progress being made against these\nactions are described in the Technical Annex  NEW ELECTRICITY MARKET MODEL  new\nElectricity Market Model (\u201cMarket Model\u201d) for Albania was approved by the\nCouncil of Ministers in July 2016 and sets out changes to the electricity sector\nthat would see  move away from the regulated market arrangements that have until\nnow been in place, towards more liberalized trading arrangements Implementation\nof the Market Model would also improve compliance with many components of the EU\nenergy acquis set out in the ECT In order to facilitate the establishing of the\nAlbanian Power Exchange and enabling TSOs or Market Operators from other\ncountries to join the APX, an amendment to the Power Sector Law was proposed and\napproved by the Albanian Government The draft law is under the review and\napproval by the Parliament OST has  full set of market rules to implement the\nMarket Model, which were approved by the ERE in December It is intended that\nimplementation of the new Market Model is phased in over the period 2017-The key\ncharacteristics of the new Market Model can be summarized as follows:  The EU\u2019\n\u201cacquis communautaire on energy\u201d is defined in Annex  of the Energy Community\nTreaty and includes  number of EU Directives and Regulations that are core to\nthe regulation of the energy sectors of EU member states ANALYSIS OF POLICIES &\nMAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 24 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA \uf0b7 Physical trading by market\nparticipants is exclusively to take place through the following platforms:\nday-ahead (\u201cDA\u201d) and intra-day (\u201cID\u201d) market, to be set up by  new Albanian\nPower Exchange  Trading of long-term physical power is permitted based on cross-\nborder capacity bought through cross-border capacity auctions \uf0b7 All other forms\nof trading will be financial, for example through bilateral Contract for\nDifference (CfDs) or establishment of decentralized futures markets \uf0b7 Specific\nbidding rules are to be developed and an efficient regulatory monitoring regime\nshall be enforced with the goal to prevent the abuse of any market power by\nspecific participants \uf0b7  Balancing Market which integrates imbalance settlement\nis to be established and operated by OST, which will balance supply and demand,\nstarting from the positions nominated by market participants through physical\ntrading, and through contracting for balancing services directly The new Market\nModel will have implications for existing commercial arrangements in the market:\n\uf0b7 Where RES generators have Power Purchase Agreements (\u201cPPAs\u201d) with the KESh\npublic supplier, the intention will be for these volumes to be traded through\nthe organized market, but with  Contract for Difference (\u201cCfD\u201d) put in place to\nkeep the RES generator whole relative to the original PPA The affected\ngenerators will need to be able to access  liquid reference price, which will be\nthe index for settlement against the strike (fixed) price in the CfD The\nwholesale public supplier role will also be transferred to OShEE once the new\nmarket model is implemented \uf0b7 There is currently  bilateral agreement in place\nbetween KESh and OShEE that governs supply of power to OShEE In order to comply\nwith the Market Model, these volumes will also be required to pass through the\nnew power exchange The Market Model refers to this as  \u201cMarket Maker Obligation\u201d\non KESh and OShEE As with the IPPs,  CfD could be put in place between KESh and\nOShEE to provide  financial hedge against volatility in the organized physical\nmarket Once implemented successfully and accompanied by cost-reflective network\nand market access tariffs, the new Market Model should facilitate improved\ncompetition, first in the wholesale market, and then in the retail market OShEE\nwill retain its supplier business, and will be exposed to competition by new\nsuppliers that could enter the market to supply end consumers An overview of the\ncommercial relationships in place on implementation of the Market Model is\npresented in the schematic in Figure ANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE\n25 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA Figure 11: Recommended Schematic of the key\ncommercial relationships under the Market Model The implications of the Market\nModel are taken into account in setting out the roles of key power sector\ninstitutions The most important actions and reforms that are required to\nimplement the Market Model can be summarized as follows: \uf0b7 OST, in consultation\nwith other market participants including ERE, is to continue work to finalize\nthe market rules for implementing the new Market Model In particular, rules for\nthe Balancing Market, the procurement of balancing services, and the calculation\nof imbalance charges need to be defined \uf0b7 The Market Model will require the APE\nto be established as  separate legal entity with the participation of OST and\nother legal entities, and strengthening for the capability of the market unit\nwithin OST, with the required capabilities being built through recruitment\nand/or training \uf0b7 Affected market participants ( IPPs), in consultation with\nERE, need to draft new financial contracts, such as CfDs, where these are\nrequired as transitional measures to ensure that the intent of previous\ncommercial agreements in honored under the new Market Model \uf0b7 All market\nparticipants will need to build new capabilities in order to interact\neffectively with the new market arrangement, for example establishing trading\ndepartments, or commercial teams to manage bilateral financial contracts  ENERGY\nEFFICIENCY LAW The new EE Law\u2019 primary objective was to align with the EU\u2019\nEnergy Efficiency Directives (2006/EC and partly 2012/EU) The main objectives of\nthe Law can be summarized as follows: \uf0b7 Setting of  National Energy Saving\nIndicative Target, and preparation of  National Energy Efficiency Action Plan\n(\u201cNEEAP\u201d) that is to be updated at least every three years \uf0b7 Creation of an\nAgency for Energy Efficiency (\u201cAgency for EE\u201d) to oversee implementation of many\nof the Law\u2019 provisions, and an Energy Efficiency Fund (\u201cEE Fund\u201d) to support and\nfinance

providers  RENEWABLE ENERGY LAW The objective of\nthe RES Law is to facilitate the harnessing of Albania\u2019 significant renewable\nenergy resources, in particular in the area of hydroelectric plants, biomass and\nbiofuel resources Through the Energy Community, Albania has set  binding target\nof 38% of its gross final energy consumption to be fulfilled from renewable\nenergy by 2020, which is an ambitious target compared to % in 2014, mostly due\nto the increase of final energy consumption Specifically, the RES Law will\nintroduce  renewable energy support scheme for electricity based on Contracts\nfor Difference (\u201cCfDs\u201d), which takes into account the creation of  competitive\nday-ahead electricity market The details of the CfD-based support scheme will\nneed to be closely coordinated with the drafting of Market Rules described\nearlier An effective CfD mechanism will require  robust reference price that RES\ngenerators can access through  liquid wholesale market This should be available\nonce the Market Model has been fully implemented  IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ROLES OF\nKEY POWER SECTOR INSTITUTIONS Figure 12 presents an overview of the key power\nsector institutions and companies in Albania: \uf0b7 Government and regulatory\nactors, which include government and ministries, the regulator, and agencies to\nwhom ministries delegate specific sector responsibilities; \uf0b7 Public sector\ncompanies, such as KESh, OST, and OShEE, who are currently major players; \uf0b7 Line\nof oversight from the relevant ministry to each public sector

ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA Figure 12: Key\nPower Sector Institutions in Albania  GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS The most\nsignificant institutions in setting policy and regulation in the power sector in\nAlbania are the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (\u201cMIE\u201d) and the regulator,\nthe Energy Regulatory Authority (\u201cERE\u201d) In addition to MIE and ERE there are\nnumber of ministries that have  smaller role in the sector, and also  number of\ngovernment agencies with responsibilities with respect to the power sector that\nare delegated to them by the ministries Council of Ministers: The Council of\nMinisters is the cabinet of Albania, which along with the Prime Minister sets\nthe overall direction for policy across the government Specifically in the\nenergy sectors, its role is review and approval of decisions that are proposed\nby MIE, such as this Energy Strategy, before the decisions can go into force\nMinistry of Infrastructure and Energy (MIE): MIE has overall responsible for the\nenergy sector and is responsible for developing energy policy and the medium and\nlong-term strategies for the energy sector MIE\u2019 key area of focus in the power\nsector is continuing to make progress in implementing reforms to align Albanian\npolicy and regulation with the EU\u2019 energy acquis This process is now well under\nway with the recent passing of the Law on the Power Sector, the EE Law, Energy\nPerformance in Building Law and RES Law Ministry through its Energy Efficiency\nAgency (EE Agency) and Energy Efficiency Fund (EE Fund) is involved in some of\nthe reforms being implemented to improve energy efficiency, specifically in\nimplementation of the Energy Performance in Buildings (\u201cEPB\u201d) Law While MIE is\nthe ministry most engaged in the sector, there are  number of other Government\nministries that work with MIE in setting the overall policy agenda for the\nsector These ministries, and the actions ANALYSIS OF

that have  smaller role within the power sector, mentioned\nbelow for completeness There are no major changes to the roles carried out by\nthese organizations as  result of the reforms currently being implemented AKBN \u2013\nNational Agency of Natural Resources: The National Agency of Natural Resources\n(\u201cAKBN\u201d) reports to MIE AKBN mission is the development, supervision of rational\nuse of natural resources, according to the government policy, and monitoring of\ntheir post-exploitation in mining, petroleum and energy These responsibilities\ninclude: \uf0b7 The proposal, consultation and cooperation with relevant government\nstructures for the design of its policies and strategies in the field of mining,\nhydrocarbons and energy; \uf0b7 The implementation of Government policies in the\nfield of mining, hydrocarbons and energy; \uf0b7 Ensuring within the scope of its\nactivity, the government critical for studies and projects in the field of\nactivity of mining, hydrocarbons and

new Agency to minimize overlap between the\ntwo agencies, and to ensure that both are working towards common goals\nSpecifically, responsibility for preparing plans for the implementation and\nmonitoring of the NEEAP is likely to move to the Agency for EE and AKBN will be\nfocus more towards RESAP AKPT \u2013 National Territorial Planning Agency and\nNational Territory Council: The National Territorial Planning Agency (\u201cAKPT\u201d) is\npublic institution subordinated to MUD that is responsible for preparation and\ncoordination of the national planning instruments AZHT - National Agency of\nDevelopment: AZHT has responsibility for making decisions regarding specific\nprojects of national importance This includes, for example, approval of\nconstruction permits for projects in the energy sector such as power generation,\ntransmission and distribution, and oil and gas projects AKM \u2013 National\nEnvironment Agency: National Environment Agency (\u201cAKM\u201d) is an institution\nsubordinated to the Ministry of Tourism and Environment, which is responsible\nfor reviewing and approving the environmental impact assessments for large\ndevelopment projects, such as those in the energy sector The Agency also has\nresponsibilities for monitoring compliance with environmental standards PUBLIC\nENERGY COMPANIES In addition to the government departments and agencies\npresented above, there are  number of large public energy companies in Albania\nwho are essentially the incumbent state-owned utilities These companies will be\naffected by elements of the reforms being implemented, such as unbundling\nrequirements, and the introduction of increasing levels of competition in the\nsector The section below sets out some of the key implications of reform for\nthese public energy companies, and the priority actions are summarized in Table\nANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 32 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA Albania\nPower Corporation, KESh: KESH remains the dominant electricity generator in\nAlbania, generating ~75% of power generated in Originally KESh was established\nas  state-owned, vertically- integrated company comprising all functions of\nelectricity generation, transmission and distribution In 1995, according to two\nlaws9, KESh was transformed into  joint stock company with 100% of the shares\nowned by the state, and KESh started to function as  commercial company However,\nKESH is still largely regulated under public service obligations, because major\npart of the production is allocated to OShEE for supply of tariff customers\nTransmission System Operator, OST: OST is the Transmission System Operator\n(\u201cTSO\u201d) in Albania managing the network at 110 kV and above On implementation of\nthe power sector reforms OST will have three main roles: \uf0b7 \uf0b7 It will remain\nowner and operator of the transmission network \u2013 the reforms will have\nrelatively little impact on this role on  day-to-day basis It is initially\nlikely to own the Albanian Power Exchange, which will be the primary trading\nplatform for the organized power market in the competitive market This is  new\nrole in the Albanian market that OST will need to build capacity for \uf0b7 OST will\ncontinue to be responsible for balancing of the system through the procurement\nof balancing and ancillary services Distribution Company, OShEE: OShEE owns the\nelectricity power distribution system below 110 kV OShEE is  single legal entity\nthat includes both the Distribution System Operator (\u201cDSO\u201d) and the Universal\nService Provider In 2009 OShEE was privatized in order to secure investment,\nimprove operational efficiency, reduce power losses, and improve revenue\ncollections With support from government it was envisaged that this would\novercome mounting losses and lead to lower, more affordable and competitive\nretail power tariffs over the medium-term From the outset, however, challenges\nbegan to emerge between CEZ, the new owners, and government regarding bad debt\nprovisions, the rate of loss reduction and annual tariff filings The\ndistribution license was revoked by the Albanian Energy Regulatory Authority\n(ERE) in 2013 on the grounds that the distribution company had failed to meet\nthe conditions of its license The company went back to public ownership and\nembarked on an ambitious program of loss reductions and improved collections and\ndramatically improved its financial position The Ministry of Infrastructure and\nEnergy and OShEE are working to unbundle the distribution wiring service from\nthe Universal Service of suppling tariff customers Unbundling of OShEE is an\nobligation under the Energy Community acquis and the Power Sector Law, which\nwill create more transparency for all users of the distribution network  No7926,\ndated 1995 \u201cOn transformation of state enterprises into commercial companies\u201d\nand No7962, dated 1995

no\nproduction of domestic natural gas However, the steady decline of oil prices in\nthe international market has caused  corresponding decline in oil production and\ninvestment in the sector in the past two years China-based Geo Jade Petroleum\nCorporation has recently bought Bankers Petroleum for approximately $440 million\nThe elements of government management over the oil and gas sector are dispersed\nthrough many ministries, agencies and public sector entities, resulting in an ad\nhoc approach to policy, which needs to be focused to meet the specialized needs\nof the oil and gas sector Institutional reforms are critical to improve the\nmanagement force needed to effectively direct the rational development of\nnation\u2019 current oil and gas sector Albania\u2019 decision to apply

vertically integrated oil company that has the exclusive\nrights for the development of all oil and gas fields Most of the oil production\nover which ALBPETROL has production rights, has been contracted out to foreign\ncompanies of which nearly 60% is exported for refining into products elsewhere\nAlbania\u2019 yet-to-be-discovered reserves of oil and gas, both offshore and\nonshore, are believed to be significant, but their exploration will require the\nuse of sophisticated technologies which are not locally available Programs must\ntherefore be developed to present these opportunities to the international oil\nindustry in  structured fashion as  means of converting them into tools of\neconomic development for Albania The petroleum sector in Albania faces\nsignificant challenges in both the upstream and downstream In the upstream,\nthere has been  steep decline in production since the 1970s and 1980s, largely\nowing to the lack of investment in exploration Albania' existing and potential\nhydrocarbon resource makes c1ear that there is significant potential for Albania\nto achieve considerable economic benefit from more extensive and intensive\npetroleum exploration and development Albania' two major petroleum basins, which\nhave thus far produced 429 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), hold\nanother 467 MMboe in proven and probable recoverable ANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN\nPRODUCTS PAGE 38 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA reserves and also have estimated\npotential from yet undiscovered fields of 718 MMboe All above mentioned figures\nare based on the declared figures of Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy as\nwell as AKBN These oil-equivalent estimates are expected to consist primarily of\noil; but the potential for gas reserves from undiscovered fields is also\nsignificant at  billion cubic meters Some preliminary study carried out from the\nIFC shows that the recent growth in Albanian oil production to roughly 21,400\nbarrel per day (bd) in 2013, largely on the basis of the ALBPETROL (Patos\nMarinza) field, which can be sustained and expanded to 44,000 bd by 2020, on the\nbasis of horizontal drilling at multiple existing oil fields After 2020, the\npotential exists for further growth in production on the strength of new\ndiscoveries-but only if Albania can optimize its policy framework to encourage\nhigh levels of exploration and development activity Unfortunately, Albania'\nregulatory and investment framework for oil and gas exploration and production\nsince the passage of the Petroleum Law in 1993 has been ineffective in promoting\nthe development of these potentially considerable hydrocarbon resources and\nseveral amendments of petroleum law in February 2017 has significantly improve\nthis law The failure of two licensing rounds in the l990s, when crude oil prices\nwere much lower than today, led to an unstructured ad-hoc approach to license\nnegotiations Nevertheless, the state has made all efforts to promote its acreage\ninternationally through \u201copen door policy\u201d and active participation in\ninternational conferences It is noted also the organization for the first time\nof the

lesser extent, the agriculture sector and is\ndominated by diesel Albania relies primarily on imported fuels, which are\nreadily available in the regional market from Italy and southeastern Europe The\nquality of petroleum products has been improved continuously and has reached the\naverage EU level, since the level of abuse with the quality is not more than %\nof the total quantity, but have been plagued by substandard products The number\nof retail gas stations relative to population is very high by European\nstandards, and needs to decrease significantly in order to meet the best\npractices Albania' refinery at Ballsh faces serious challenges to its continued\ncommercially viable operation as crude oil refinery It is very small by European\nand global standards, and thus lack the economies of scale and the catalytic\nconversion technology that is required to process the locally available heavy\ncrude oils with their high sulphur and acid content The refinery is

FOR ALBANIA  NEED FOR  STRATEGIC PLAN FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS\nAlbania will provide  vital link and have  concrete institutional role in\ncompleting the energy loops that tie Italy, Central Europe and the Balkan states\ninto  more integrated energy system that provides far greater energy security\nthrough  multitude of suppliers and energy transportation vehicles The Albanian\nGovernment\u2019 vision therefore is to promote economic development by serving as an\nenergy transit corridor for electricity, natural gas and oil in all its forms,\nto move into greater Europe by sea and by overland pipeline Its geographic\nlocation places Albania in the position of sharing its newly acquired energy\nsources with those of its neighbors in South East Europe, through the\ndevelopment of energy wheeling networks to strengthen the regional energy\nsecurity of its neighbors, as well as itself Given the impending arrival of the\nTAP pipeline and the potential reinvigoration of domestic exploration and\nproduction of oil and gas both onshore and offshore Albania, the development of\nan integrated strategic plan for the entire oil and gas economic subsector is\ncritical Each of the many components of Government that will ultimately be\nrelated to the utilization of oil and gas, must be integrated into  single\nsmooth, functioning system, connected to its adjacent related Ministries in such\nfashion that the benefits of increase energy access may be shared by the rest of\nthe government and through that, to the population in general The broad elements\ninherent in  national strategy for the oil and gas sector include:  Establishing\nbaseline that adequately defines Albania\u2019 present place in its oil and gas\ndevelopment  Defining  series of development objectives that are to be achieved\nagainst  fixed time- line for the plan to succeed by the agreed upon time,\ncurrently  Creating detailed plans for implementation of each major component of\nthe plan along  time-line  Adjusting existing Government mechanisms for\nadministrative, technical management, legal, regulations, and regulatory\ncompliance elements as required to efficiently administer and manage the\neconomic development of the national petroleum resource Much of the above has\nalready been accomplished, but needs to be organized and put into  plan format\nThere has been little apparent movement in this direction so far within Albania\u2019\nhydrocarbon sector 10 INCENTIVES FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY INVESTMENT Given the\nimportance of energy efficiency (EE) measures, which includes RES use on the\ndemand side, specific financing measures and fiscal incentives were examined\nbased on best practices identified by old and new EU Member States Table  shows\nthe types of

proposes recommendations for financing mechanisms and fiscal incentives\nin Albania to support the sustainable implementation of the Second NEEAP as well\nas to implement all measures presented under the EE Scenario presented in\nSection  of this strategy No single measure is going to diminish the challenges\nwhich Albania is facing Only  comprehensive package of awareness and information\non legal, financial, fiscal and institutional measures will gradually improve\nthe situation and bring Albania closer to modern standards in the energy\nefficiency field Such  package should include: \uf0b7 Transposition and adoption of\ntechnical regulations and other secondary legislation, which should be prepared\nin the following short term period; \uf0b7 Fully staffed and operational Energy\nEfficiency Agency, as leading implementing body \uf0b7 Capacity building at all\nlevels; \uf0b7 Continuous awareness raising campaigns; \uf0b7 Permanent advice and\ntechnical information on EE for all energy consumers; \uf0b7 Establishment of the\nEnergy Efficiency Fund shall be  legal person, having the status of  non- profit\norganization and an energy tax as  source of income for the energy efficiency\nfund; ANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 43 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA \uf0b7\nThe Fund aims to provide financial support and project management for developing\nmarket of energy efficiency improvement and supporting programs for final\ncustomers with high-cost and high-risk investments \uf0b7 The Fund shall be used to\npromote energy efficiency improvement programs, energy service companies,\nindependent energy experts, energy auditors, energy distributors, distribution\nsystem operators, retail energy sales companies and installers of efficient\nequipment \uf0b7 Grants for low cost EE investments for vulnerable groups, \uf0b7 Energy\naudits of public buildings; \uf0b7 Grants for energy audits of multi-apartment\nbuildings, commercial services and industry, \uf0b7 Loans at lower interest rates\nfrom IFIs for EE investment in public buildings, \uf0b7 Investment deduction for\nselected EE investments, \uf0b7 Detailed studies on appropriate fiscal mechanisms to\nsupport EE investments, especially related to VAT reduction for selected EE\ninvestments the relevant sector, \uf0b7 Specific financing schemes for vulnerable\ngroups (  \u2018Pay as You Save\u2019 mechanism), \uf0b7 Detailed studies on poverty and energy\nservice affordability, \uf0b7 Regulatory tariff incentives on energy efficiency\nENERGY EFFICIENCY FUND Energy efficiency funds are helpful in overcoming market\nbarriers to energy efficiency investments in general and for specific energy\nconsumer groups At start-up, such  fund needs access to grant financing from\nglobal trust funds such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and this\nstrategy recognizes that MIE is working in this direction with the support of\nthe UNDP Climate Change Unit Furthermore, the Government will try to get loans\non favorable terms from IFIs like the World Bank, foreign financial institutions\nsuch as Climate Change Fund, WB, KfW, EBRD and the EIB, and bilateral donors for\nsecuring the initial EE Fund budget In addition, the EE Fund will secure an\ninitial fund from the State Budget based on the State Budget Law The sustainable\noperation of the Fund will be guaranteed through  stable annual income coming\nfrom energy carrier and environmental pollution taxes Ministry of Infrastructure\nand Energy will carry out  feasibility study for defining the amount of the\nexpenses for the yearly operation of the fund and also covering the pilot\nprojects carried out in the different sectors When  market segment is\nsufficiently developed to attract commercial financing, the Energy Efficiency\n(EE) Fund\u2019 objective has been reached and it can be phased out over the medium-\nterm (at least five years) Energy efficiency funds are usually established for\nimplementation of national energy efficiency programs and action plans  An EE\nFund may be based on one of three financing options: ) loan guarantees, )\ninterest rate buy-downs or investment deduction and ) direct loans EE Fund will\nnot play the role of classic bank and Figure 13 lists the key characteristics of\neach fund model ANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN

pays part of the\ninvestment \u2022Lower loan costs improve project economic performance \u2022Interest rate\npayment or investment deduction decreases Fund assets \u2022Disadvantage: Repayment\nand grace period are often more relevant than interest rate or investment\n\u2022Advantage: Interest rate is higher in Albania, thus reduced interest rate may\nmake for attractive loans; \u2022Lack of equity fiancing may make loans attractive\ndue to investment deduction Direct funding \u2022Fund gives preferential loans to the\nusers directly (reduced interest rate, longer repayment period, longer grace\nperiod) \u2022Better loan conditions can be provided \u2022Fund gathers and evaluates loan\napplications \u2022When loans are reimbursed the Fund can be used again \u2022Funds for\nenvironmental protection, EE and RES can be combined Figure 13: Main\ncharacteristics of EE Fund models Based on the new Energy Efficiency Law, the\nGovernment plans to establish soon an Energy Efficiency Fund, which shall\nfunction as  legal entity, having the status of  non-profit organization The\nEnergy Efficiency Fund shall be governed by  Board of Trustees with members\nrepresenting MIE and other Ministries engaged in the improvement of energy\nefficiency in the areas under their responsibility Each of the Fund models\npresented above can potentially stimulate EE investments However, these models\nhave different impacts in terms of their ability to mobilize new investment,\nmake efficient use of the Fund\u2019 capital and ensure the sustainability of the\nFund\u2019 operation Some advantages and drawbacks of Fund models are listed in Table\nANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 45 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA Table :\nAdvantages and Drawbacks of Energy

to finance\ncollected new projects ( act as  revolving fund) However, if the annual income\nof the EE Fund is secured by energy and environmental taxes, then the\nsustainability of the Fund\u2019 operations can be achieved Based on the advantages\nand drawbacks of fund options presented above, the following actions are\nrecommended for the EE Fund development \uf0b7 Begin by providing loan guarantees, so\nthat by reducing the risk exposure of the Fund, higher external investments can\nbe attracted \uf0b7 Determine the Fund models to be used for different investment\nprojects, according to the type of projects, the level of investment and the\ntype of client ANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 46 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR\nALBANIA \uf0b7 Utilize interest rate payment reductions, because the benefits for\nsmaller investments are low \uf0b7 Utilize investment deductions with caution,\nparticularly if the annual income of the Fund is not secured since this option\nspends the Fund\u2019 resources the fastest \uf0b7 Build up  capability to offer direct\nloans over the medium-term, cooperating where possible with similar existing\nstate institutions such as  Guarantee Fund, or  Development Fund \uf0b7 Draft\neligibility and evaluation criteria for investments to be supported by the Fund\nfor pre- screening of potential projects and to ensure that the development of\nselected projects helps the Fund achieve its priorities \uf0b7 Prepare promotion of\nthe Fund among target groups to bring together all potential partner\norganizations (commercial banks, project developers, clients-investors) that may\nwish to cooperate with or capitalize the Fund in future \uf0b7 Evaluate cooperation\nalternatives with external financiers and identify how the Fund, partner\ninstitutions and clients can benefit from such cooperation SUPPORT ENERGY\nEFFICIENCY MECHANISMS IN BUILDINGS SECTOR BUILDING EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS\nSupport mechanisms to improve energy efficiency in the buildings sector are\ndifferent for public buildings, commercial buildings and households Taking into\naccount the mechanisms applied in EU Member States, the following suggestions\ncould be used for Albania: \uf0b7 In additions to EE Fund it is very important to\ninvestigate other financing mechanisms, including preferential loans, grants,\nsubsides and third party financing, which are recommended rather than fiscal\nmechanisms; \uf0b7 Financing of energy efficiency measures in central and municipal\npublic buildings should be organized by the government in close collaboration\nwith local authorities Improvements in the energy efficiency of public buildings\nand public street lighting may be financed from grants that are still provided\nby IFIs and PPP model/ESCO projects Grants and soft loans should be sought from\nIFIs for specific activities PPP model/ESCO projects typically include detailed\nenergy auditing, technical design, implementation and monitoring and\nverification of the results (energy and cost savings, cost and energy\nindicators); Also, \uf0b7 Improvements in the energy efficiency of commercial\nbuildings should be financed by preferential loans from existing guarantee funds\nsuch as the EBRD Sustainable Energy Fund (SEF) Programme (under Western Balkan\nSustainable Energy Programme) Implementation of Western Balkans Green

improve the energy efficiency of households should combine\nawareness, technical advice and information, and preferential loans for EE\ninvestments from an established list \uf0b7 Financing of low income households should\nfocus on low cost measures and technical advice which will be subsidized either\nfrom  state budget allocation or from local authority budgets and by redirected\nsubsidies from energy utilities to end-users; SOLAR WATER HEATING INCENTIVES The\nfollowing financial and fiscal measures for promotion of solar hot water\ntechnologies should be further investigated and recommended to be followed to\nmaintain the momentum of such technology use in residential, commercial and\npublic buildings as well as in some industrial sectors \uf0b7 Exempt producers of\nsolar thermal systems from the customs duties and VAT for these solar water\nheaters \uf0b7 Reimburse producers or assemblers of the solar water heating systems\nproviding sanitary or technological hot water the customs duties paid for the\nraw materials imported for actually assembling or producing solar water heating\nsystems The Council of Ministers, upon the proposal of Minister responsible for\nenergy, shall approve the rules and procedures for governing reimbursement of\nsuch customs duties \uf0b7 The Council of Ministers, upon the proposal of the\nMinister responsible for energy, shall determine the economy sectors and the\ncategories of buildings, the minimum area or the capacity of the solar water\nheating systems, technical requirements of solar water heating systems to be\ninstalled as well as the specific procedures and criteria to be followed\nregarding the enforcement and monitoring of such an obligation by the\nresponsible institutions SUPPORT ENERGY EFFICIENCY MECHANISMS IN INDUSTRY SECTOR\nThe only grant program available for the industry sector is managed by EBRD\n(WeBSEDFF) with  grant level up to 20% of the loan amount required, and Albania\nis part of this scheme since IFIs usually extend loans to local Participating\nBanks which then provide loans to private sector companies for industrial energy\nefficiency projects In Albania, the new EE Law defines an ESCOs role, and the\nGovernment support to ESCOs, based on new secondary legislation that will be\nprepared during 2018 and will assign their development to the private sector\nonly SUPPORT OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY MECHANISMS IN TRANSPORT SECTOR On average in\nthe EU, half of the measures in the transport sector are directly targeted at\ncars and that share rises to 60% if measures on fuel substitution ( on the\npromotion of biofuels) are also included Only  limited number of measures\naddress freight transport, despite it being the transport mode with the most\nrapid increase in energy consumption in last decade Two-thirds of national\nmeasures target improvement in the efficiency of -or reduction of CO2 emissions\nfrom - new cars, with financial incentives to purchase more efficient/low\nemission new cars being the most common measure Based on the experience of new\nand old EU Member States discussed above, and different financial and fiscal\nANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 48 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA\nmechanisms, the following are recommendations that can be implemented in Albania\nand can bring significant EE improvements in the transport sector: \uf0b7 Require\nVehicle Technical Centers (VTCs) to provide strict and regular technical\ntesting, including measurement of air pollutant and CO2 emissions, for all\ncategories of cars and freight transport These VTCs will be useful for\ngovernments in preparing taxes related to energy efficiency and forecasting of\ntransport energy use and in providing  realistic basis for target setting and\neffective regulation \uf0b7 Develop measures for  purchase tax and annual tax on cars\nand other vehicles should be linked to energy efficiency performance It will be\nuseful to study the example of the French government, which has taken innovative\naction in this area by setting up  combined subsidy and tax scheme, with\nsubsidy for low emission cars ( <130g CO2/km) and  tax on cars with high\nemissions ( above 161g CO2/km) \uf0b7 Establishment and implementation of EE criteria\nin procurement of state and municipality vehicles and transport services \uf0b7\nAnother measure to be developed for the medium-term is the introduction of road\ncharging Road charges for heavy goods vehicles are already in place in many EU\ncountries The German Toll Collect system is an innovative system that uses\nsatellite-guided systems rather than conventional tolls and links road charges\nto the vehicles\u2019 emissions factor The toll revenues are used to subsidize rail\nand water transport infrastructures 11 ELECTRICITY TARIFF REFORM LONG-TERM\nSTRATEGY The long term tariff strategy for the Albanian power sector should take\naccount of the following interconnected features \uf0b7 The evolution of the power\nmarket in Albania, particularly the creation of  competitive wholesale and\nretail market which will require legally, functionally and financially separate\ntransmission and distribution entities \uf0b7 Abandoning price regulation in the\nwholesale market (including through PSO), and continue with deregulation of the\npublic generation according to the Power Sector Law \uf0b7 The insolvency of the\nentire Albanian power sector and the importance of restoring it to solvency over\ntime to avoid the need for government subsidy \uf0b7 The priorities for development\nof the sector and in particular the enhancement of the role of renewable energy\nthrough the development of small scale hydro, wind and solar PV capacity in\norder to meet EU and national priorities and sustainability \uf0b7 The priorities for\ndevelopment of the sector and in particular the enhancement of consumer benefits\nin terms of securing supply of electrical power and quality of service \uf0b7 The\ndevelopment of sustainable tariff reforms in order to protect especially\nvulnerable customers as well as to increase the efficiency of the electrical\npower system of Albania ANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 49 ENERGY\nSTRATEGY FOR ALBANIA \uf0b7 The integration of the Albanian power market with the\nregional market, and later with the European power market in compliance with the\nacquis POWER MARKET EVOLUTION Significant changes in the power market will\ncreate  regional market for power generators, with all generation passing\nthrough the market Albania will have improved insurance against dry years when\nhydro generation falls below normal levels, providing greater consistency in\ncosts between wet and dry years as the regional market improves price stability\nfor generation KESH is likely to become significantly more profitable,\nespecially in wet years, by selling into  regional market against higher cost\nthermal generators The extent to which KESH can become profitable depends partly\non how much electricity it can sell to the market and how much (if any) it is\nobliged to sell under the public service obligation The overall impact on\nAlbania and the extent of imports and exports are also uncertain and will depend\non both the evolution of the market and power sector investment decisions in\nboth Albania and the countries with which it trades power SECTOR INSOLVENCY The\ninsolvency of the Albanian power sector is quite severe It stems in large part\nfrom the performance of the distribution company OSHEE since there are excessive\ntechnical and non-technical losses in the distribution sector and inadequate\ncollection of cash from customer bills In principle, this problem can be\naddressed by significant financial injections from the Government, by policy and\nother reforms to improve the financial performance of sector entities or by\ncombination of these two approaches Given that government finances are very\ntight and policy reforms would be needed to complement any financial injections\nin order that such injections were not required regularly Therefore, the focus\nshould be on initiatives that can improve financial performance through\ninitiatives in the sector that do not require government funding or an\nexpectation of any other external finance Reforms implemented by the Albanian\ngovernment in 2014, improved the ability of OSHEE to collect overdue debts\naccrued over the years Moreover, it decreased non-technical losses of power in\nthe local grid due to the unlawful interventions of third parties Specifically,\nthe amendments of the Albanian Criminal Code (Law  7895), in full force since\nSeptember 2014 increased the legal responsibilities of any individual and/or\nlegal entity unlawfully stealing electricity The Government needs to continue to\nimprove the financial solvency of the OSHEE and of KESH which will help promote\nimportant investments in the power sector RENEWABLE ENERGY The Government has\ncommitted to  policy of increasing the use of renewable energy, primarily\nhydropower, solar and wind, with small-scale hydropower having the highest\npriority Methodologies for offering support schemes have been developed as part\nof this strategy and are described in the Technical Annex At this stage they\naddress general principles However, the detail will need to be kept under review\nas the Albanian power market evolves In particular: \uf0b7 Government will ensure\nthat the levels of all renewable energy sources generating electricity offered\nto the market are manageable within the framework of other electricity sources\nand the evolving market ANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 50 ENERGY\nSTRATEGY FOR ALBANIA \uf0b7 There is already extensive experience in commissioning\nsmall scale hydro projects through concession agreements Such hydro projects are\ntherefore likely to continue to be the main source of renewable energy projects,\nbuilding on this experience However, for solar and wind projects there is little\nprevious experience The Government has defined the FiT for solar, wind and\nbiomass energy in order to promote the best site and in the same time help to\nreach the respective targets \uf0b7 The development of  regional market is likely to\nlead to greater variation in prices over the day, season (winter-summer) and the\nbenefits of by optimizing the utilization of scale hydro projects with small\nsolar photovoltaic and wind power plants to help balance intermittent solar and\nwind power will increase significantly benefits and the tariff policy should\nrecognize this RETAIL PRICES AND TRANSMISSION TARIFFS The developments discussed\nabove will not affect the methodology for retail prices applied for electricity\nsupply under public service and the role of the Universal Service Provider\ndirectly However, there are potential significant implications as the market\ndevelops, generation tariffs are being deregulated, and increased renewable\ngeneration introduces greater uncertainty into estimating the level of\ngeneration There are two broad areas in which changes are likely to be needed: \uf0b7\nChanges in retail Universal Service prices structure to respond to variations in\ngeneration prices and make tariffs more cost reflective for that particular\ncategory of consumer \uf0b7 Actions by the system operator to incentivize short term\nmanagement of the balance between supply and demand through  competitive\nbalancing market For the system operator, OST, the new market arrangements will\nmean that balancing supply and demand becomes more complex System operators have\ndevised numerous ways of coping with the challenges arising from this complexity\nThe arrangements will depend on the characteristics of consumer demand on the\nAlbanian system The responsibility for devising innovative mechanisms for\nbalancing demand will include balance responsibility and competitive balancing\nmarket, enforced and implemented by OST However, the Government will want to\nensure that the utilities are thinking ahead in devising new mechanisms and\nensuring that the quality, economy and reliability of the power system are\nenhanced by them FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE ALBANIAN POWER SECTOR Albania\u2019\npower sector has made financial and operational progress in recent years Results\nfor  suggest that all three major utilities were profitable and showed financial\nperformance improvements compared to Supplies are generally reliable, although\nvoltage sometimes drops to very low levels at the end of long distribution lines\nHowever, the power sector faces three interconnected and major issues These\nissues are only partly within the capacity of ERE as regulator to resolve In\nparticular, the Government, as owner of the main generation, transmission and\ndistribution companies, has to exercise its ownership responsibilities more\neffectively in order to resolve these issues and create  more sustainable power\nsector The three core issues are firstly the insolvency of the sector, in\nparticular the distribution company OSHEE, secondly excessive technical and non-\ntechnical losses in the distribution sector and thirdly inadequate collection of\ncash from customer bills The reform implemented by the Albanian Government\nANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 51 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA\nrecently in the power electricity sector aimed at collecting debts and enforcing\nthe prevention of energy non-payment11 by customers has had some impact, but the\nfinancial position remains difficult The extent of the insolvency of the sector\ncan be illustrated by the financial position of OSHEE, which had negative equity\nof over 55 billion ALL at the end of 2015 (Figure 14) This is an improvement as\nthere was negative equity of over 71 billion ALL at the end of 2014 but it is\nuncertain whether this performance improvement can be sustained Moreover, the\nfinancial data of the OSHEE balance sheet for the first semester of 2016 made\navailable online in its website12, shows  further improvement in the financial\nposition of the company compared to The position of KESH is better in that its\nbalance sheet appears solvent but the company has significant short term credits\nand loans, much of it in the form of an overdraft, amounting to over 44 billion\nALL at the end of This is also an improvement on the 2014 position when short\nterm credits and loans amounted to over 49 billion ALL but KESH would not be\ncapable of repaying the overdraft and other short term debt in the near term In\nprinciple an overdraft is repayable on demand by the bank and as  matter of\nprinciple the balance on the overdraft should reduce to zero at least once\nduring each year The overdraft is providing long term financing for the company\u2019\noperations Similarly, the transmission company OST had trade receivables of\nbillion ALL in 2015 and  billion ALL in 2014, again showing  small improvement\nThese amounts are largely receivables due from OSHEE and are equivalent to over\nyear\u2019 transmission revenue This in turn damages the position of OST Resolving\nthese issues can only be achieved over  period of time There are manifold\nchallenges in devising  package of measures which will deliver improved\nperformance while achieving political and social acceptability Responses are\nrequired from both ERE and Government These are necessary conditions for\nsectoral performance improvement Their effectiveness can be enhanced by  number\nof further financial reforms to boost sector performance and by changes to the\nway the ERE reviews investment plans in order to make its role more manageable\nThe Government will work with ERE to develop  joint plan to carry out the\nreforms 11 The available data shows decreased of the non-paid energy from 52% in\n2013 to about % for the first six months of 12  ANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN\nPRODUCTS PAGE 52 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA Figure 14: Institutional\nArrangements in the Albanian Electricity Sector Better management of losses and\ncash collection can lead to huge improvements in sector financial performance\nSuch improvements can be complemented by  number of other financial initiatives\nthat will help to enhance performance further The following activities would be\nclearly complementary to loss reduction initiatives: \uf0b7 Developing  sector\nfinancial model \uf0b7 Reformulating the Universal Service Supplier responsibilities\n\uf0b7 Permitting the utilities to earn  higher rate of return on equity \uf0b7 Carrying\nout financial restructuring of each of the utilities to place them in  solvent\nposition DEVELOPING FINANCIAL MODEL At present Government and ERE do not have\ncomprehensive financial model to help inform decisions regarding the entire\nelectricity sector Government should create one interconnected model that\nconnects the accounting structures of the three publicly owned utilities so that\nthe overall financial implications of tariff and other regulatory and financial\ndecisions can be evaluated quickly and easily The model should cover all the\ninteractions between the generation, transmission and distribution businesses\nANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 53 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA so\nthat, for example, the impact of an increased generation tariff on distribution\ntariffs and financing can be evaluated It should also have the capacity to make\nforward projections so that the impact of investment programs and the evolution\nof the regional power market can be evaluated It should enable the calculation\nof financial ratios such as the debt equity ratio, self-financing ratio and debt\nservice coverage ratio The model should enable both government and ERE to carry\nout evaluations of power sector finances UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPLIER\nRESPONSIBILITIES At present, the Universal Service Supplier (USS)\nresponsibilities are  mechanism which enables certain categories of consumer to\nbenefit from the availability of relatively less expensive power from regulated,\nstate-owned hydro generation In the past all consumers were beneficiaries, but\nthe USS is being progressively withdrawn from high and medium voltage consumers\nas the power market evolves Consumers connected to the distribution network at\n10 kV and 6kV will cease to be eligible for supply by the USS on December 31,\nThereafter, only low voltage ( kV) households and eventually small enterprises\nwill qualify to get supply service from USS Nevertheless, the low voltage\ncustomers shall be eligible to switch to  competitive retail on their own accord\nGovernment, supported by ERE, will need to develop further and replace the USS\nresponsibility with  clear government commitment to support alleviation of\nenergy poverty for the socially vulnerable consumers rather than uniform support\nacross customer classes at lower voltages Once such customers are identified and\nthe conditions are regulated and enforced,  lifeline tariff could be applied to\nthe poorest consumers applying funds outside the electricity market (with no\ncross-subsidizing), with other consumers paying cost reflective tariffs The\nGovernment will seek to define the criteria in  transparent manner The financial\nimpact of this on the responsible suppliers ( OSHEE) would still need to be\ndetermined and such suppliers to be compensated without disturbing the\nelectricity market or cost of supply to other consumers RATE OF RETURN FOR KESH\nThe present tariff model only permits KESH to earn  return on its assets\nequivalent to the one-year government bond rate This rate is likely to be too\nlow for  power utility which requires long term finance for up to thirty years\nIn general, longer term debt commands  higher interest rate than short term\nmoney such as one year bonds Equity rates of return are higher still KESH is\nhighly unlikely to be able to achieve adequate self-financing for its investment\nprogram unless it is permitted to earn an equity rate of return on at least some\nof its investment This will continue to be an issue as long as KESH continues to\nsell some power to OSHEE under special arrangements and outside the market Once\nall power passes through the market it will cease to be an issue 10 FINANCIAL\nRESTRUCTURING At some point  substantial sector financial restructuring is\nlikely to be required to place all power companies on  sustainable basis This\nmay for example require the write off of some debt owed by OSHEE to KESH The aim\nshould be to place debt within the sector on  sustainable and commercial basis\nThis sort of restructuring is only worthwhile if the various parties are\nrequired to operate on  commercial basis in the future Thus, current\ninterventions such as the government requirement that OSHEE only needs to pay\n85% of the invoice for transmission tariffs from OST would have to be dropped\nThese sorts ANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 54 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR\nALBANIA of interventions serve only to entrench mismanagement in the sector and\nhave no role in  commercial power sector 11 IMPROVING MANAGEABILITY OF THE\nREGULATOR\u2019 ROLE At present ERE tries to review tariff applications against very\ntight time deadlines ERE could discharge its responsibilities more effectively\nif the submission of tariff applications was separated from the submission of\ninvestment plans for transmission and distribution Investment plans could be\nsubmitted at  different time of year and developed more thoroughly in  way that\nwould enable ERE to review the plans more effectively and approve investment\nwith more confidence There are already requirements for the transmission and\ndistribution companies to produce ten and five year investment plans\nrespectively and this requirement should be enforced within the next year ERE\nshould develop formats and timetables for the separate submission of investment\nplans by the transmission and distribution utilities Government will also\nbenefit from this initiative as it will enable government, as owner of the\ncompanies, to scrutinize their plans more closely The plans should demonstrate\nthat the companies have the financial and operational capacity to carry out the\nproposed investment plans and be realistic in the light of performance in\nprevious years The steps required to implement the program described above and\npossible timings are outlined in Table It is assumed that there will not be any\ngovernment cash injection to the sector Table 10: Steps Requires to Improve\nPower Sector Financial Solvency Item Requirement from ERE and government for\nOSHEE to develop performance improvement plan to reduce losses and increase cash\ncollection Timing Early 2018 Responsibility Government and ERE to instruct OSHEE\nJointly to OSHEE improvement plan, government and ERE develop for performance\nreview by First version in June 2018 then updated annually OSHEE Develop sector\nfinancial model By end of 2018 ERE, with external assistance Permit higher\nreturns for KESH In 2018 price approval Government to approve Perform financial\nrestructuring Complete in Final timing depends performance improvement on\nGovernment to authorize, ERE to oversee implementation Reschedule submissions to\nregulator From 2018 Government and ERE jointly 12 EXPERIENCE WITH FEED-IN\nTARIFFS FOR RES TECHNOLOGIES The electricity tariffs for qualifying RES\ngenerators needs to reflect the cost of service, and the recommended strategy\nfor  support schemes according to the RES Law and the respective Council of\nMinisters Decisions for Small Hydro Power Plans (SHPPs), Photovoltaic Power\nPlans (PvPPs) and Wind Power Plans (WPPs) Tariff setting process is based on\nnumber of important documents: ) Existing structure of electricity tariffs; )\nRES Targets for the period  and the impact of RES- support schemes for average\nelectricity tariffs; and ) Qualitative analysis of year 2015 on costs and\naverage tariffs ANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 55 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR\nALBANIA The Technical Annex presents  summary of the core characteristics of\nsupport schemes used in  variety of countries in the & region Of the nine\ncountries studies all use feed-in tariffs as support mechanisms except one,\nwhere tradable green certificates are being used The regime of tradable\ncertificates was included in the review as it offers valuable insights to the\nset-up of alternative support mechanisms All regimes are  market based support\nschemes systems In addition to the obligation of connecting RES generators, most\nsupport systems also require suppliers or grid operators to purchase RES\ngenerated electricity based on the purchase supporting obligation scheme of RES-\ngeneration 13 PROPOSED SUPPORT METHODOLOGY FOR RES PLANTS The new RES Law\nspecifies that  support schemes system will be introduced that takes into\naccount the type of technology and efficiency of generating equipment The new\nRES Law also provides other incentives such as: \uf0b7 Establishment of  national RES\ntarget in the total energy final consumption; \uf0b7 Obligatory connection to the\ntransmission or distribution networks; \uf0b7 Payment only of the direct costs of\nconnection to the electricity transmission or distribution networks; \uf0b7 Long-term\n(15 years) power purchase agreements for the electricity produced from Priority\nRES power plants up to 15 MW installed capacity will remain the same However,\nthe support scheme will be based on  contract for differences ERE will prepare\nthe respective secondary legislation for their implementation \uf0b7 Obligatory off-\ntake of the electricity produced from Priority RES power plants In addition, all\nRES plants with installed capacity higher than  MW will now have balancing\nresponsibilities As  result of these measures, interest in RES power plants has\ngrown considerably and new plants have started to be constructed \u2013 initially\nsmall hydropower and photovoltaic power plants, which are the best- known and\navailable technologies In addition, several investors have started to request\nauthorizations for wind turbines as well as biomass power plants  key component\nof the new RES law is  new tariff methodology which is the result of  study ERE\nhad undertaken in June 2017 to define the most appropriate methodology Because\nthe private sector has been identified as the key player in the development of\nthe RES sector, the focus of the methodology was to consider the rate of return\non the project from the viewpoint of the private investor Hence the study came\nto the conclusion that the result of  long run marginal unit cost (LRMC)\nanalysis should be the basis on which the feed in tariff for each type of\nqualifying RES power plant must be based The study concluded that: \uf0b7 The EU\ntargets for renewable energy share can only be met by  significant share of new\nSHPPs, the utilization of solar energy for providing heat and electricity,\ntraditional and new industrial biomass resources, and wind power plants, which\nrequires mobilization of the private sector \uf0b7 The level of investment needed\nwill requires considerable involvement from private investors who are looking\nfor an attractive rate of return on their investment \uf0b7 Given the current market\nconditions: -10 years loan maturity,  years grace,  rate of return on equity %\nshould make an investment attractive to this sector ANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN\nPRODUCTS PAGE 56 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA The new RES Law requires the\nCouncil of Ministers to approve, based on the proposal of ERE, the methodology\nfor establishing the support schemes for Priority Producers of SHPPs, PvPPs,\nWPPs, BioGas PPs It is important that the methodology () allow the recovery of\nthe investments in the installation using the currently available renewable\nenergy technology with reasonable profit, (ii) determine the maximum\ninstallation size for each type of qualifying RES technology, (iii) determine\nthe total installed capacity for each type of RES technology that will benefit\nfrom the support schemes, (iv) take into account the social and economic impacts\nof the support scheme on consumers, () include an indexation formula to cover\ninflation for each year, and vi) establish  formula for the calculation of any\nadditional RES Surcharge on end-user\u2019 electricity price for all electricity\nconsumers in Albania The new RES Law specifies that the support will be given\nunder  contract for differences (CfD) that provides  variable premium calculated\nas the difference payment between an administratively prefixed price (the strike\nprice) and  measure of the market price for electricity (the reference price) \uf0b7\nThe strike price (support schemes level) has to be calculated in such  way as to\nmake  significant volume of  particular renewable energy technology economically\nviable and as such incentivize investment decisions The reference price is\nprice which is based on Albanian Power Exchange (APEX) price or before on\ncomparable wholesale market price in  given period To ensure that the renewable\nenergy producers are not being overcompensated, the off-takers are obliged to\npay the difference between the reference price and the strike price to the CfD \uf0b7\nFinancial support under  contract for difference (CfD) and the level of such\nsupport is in principle to be determined via  competitive, non-discriminatory\nbidding process (auction) to become  qualified producer of electricity from\nrenewable energy sources \uf0b7 CfD\u2019 will have  duration of 15 years The\nrelationships among and the role of market participants in the physical\noperation of the Market Model are defined by agreements between the individual\nparticipants and the Albanian Power Exchange (APE) and TSO, or regulated through\napplicable standard bilateral agreements All RES power plants are divided in two\ngroups: all RES plants with installed capacity lower than  MW will not have any\nbalancing responsibility; and all RES plants with installed capacity greater\nthan  MW will have balancing responsibility Any fine/fee/penalty that will be\nimposed for not meeting balancing responsibility and how it will be decided\nunder draft RES Law by Decision of Council of Ministers, which will be needed to\nbe drafted and approved for practical implementation of the APE and future RES\nLaw requirements The Technical Annex provides detailed proposals for the\nmethodology of calculating strike price for specific RES technologies Table 11\npresents the strategic recommendation to be taken

Albania to meet its growing demand for energy In 2014,\ntotal energy consumption in Albania was 2070 ktoe15 Electricity consumption was\n7722 GWh, or 34 percent of primary energy use With  projected annual GDP growth\nrate of % for the coming decades, energy consumption is also expected to\nincrease In order for Albania to sustain its growth, the country will need to\nfind additional sources of energy and invest in its energy transportation and\ndelivery infrastructure New energy sources and infrastructure investments will\nhelp Albania\u2019 energy sector to continue its transformation towards  more\ncompetitive marketplace, while aligning with the Third Energy Package initiative\nand objectives Albania is one of the earlier Contracting Parties to have\nsuccessfully achieved

STRATEGY\nFOR ALBANIA The integration of the Albanian electricity market to the European\nelectricity market requires that  competitive wholesale and retail market should\nbe established first in the country The new Power Sector Law (PSL) provides\ngradual opening of the retail market and establishment of an immediate\ncompetitive wholesale market Based on PSL,  new Albanian Market Model was\napproved by the Council of Ministers The development and approval of the\nAlbanian Market Model (AMM) is the final step towards the development of the\nAlbanian Electricity Market into  fully competitive power market in line with\nthe Energy Community obligations Closely linked to the previous two\ndevelopments,  process towards the establishment of an Albanian Power Exchange\n(APE) has been initiated which also requires further alignment of the electrical\npower market in full compliance with the Energy Community In addition to\nallowing for further regional integration between Albania and its neighboring\ncountries, the updated Albanian Market Model should encourage the following: \uf0b7\nHigher consumer benefits in terms of securing supply of electrical power and\nquality service; \uf0b7 More efficient utilization of the cross-border trading\nbetween Albania and its neighboring countries allowing the Albanian power sector\ngain on their specific generation portfolio; \uf0b7 The harmonization of the power\nlegislation and market practice with the requirements of Energy Community\nTreaty; \uf0b7 Finalizing the move from the vertical integrated structure of the\nElectricity Sector towards  structure with legally, functionally and financially\nseparate Supply, Generation, Transmission and Distribution entities allowing for\ncompetition in wholesale and retail markets; \uf0b7 The development of the\nelectricity market according to clear market rules and grid codes as minimal\ntechnical requirements for an efficient operation of the Power System; \uf0b7 The\nimplementation of third party access in order to participate in the electricity\nmarket and the creation of the conditions for the development of  transparent\nand non-discriminatory market; \uf0b7 The liberalization of the power market,\ncreating structure that increases the interest and number of participants and\nopens the sector for competition and foreign participants and investors; \uf0b7 The\nmonitoring of the electricity market by ERE; \uf0b7 The need to design and implement\nrules that provide for level-playing field for carrying out transactions in the\nmarkets, as well as market integrity regime to mitigate market manipulation,\nmarket abuse and insider trading in line with the European best practice; and \uf0b7\nThe integration of the Albanian Electricity Market with the Regional Market in\nSouth East Europe, and later with the European Electricity Market to be  guiding\ndesign principle The Albanian Market Model is characterized by  wholesale market\nbased on bilateral transactions, while all the physical contracts are traded on\nan organized Day-Ahead and Intraday Market organized through the APE The ERE,\nthe Albanian Competition Authority and State Aid Commission shall, in\ncoordination with the Energy Community Secretariat and in consultation with the\nmarket participants, make sure that appropriate and well-justified measures are\ntaken for ensuring that the market performance satisfies the criteria of\ntransparency and openness as well as security of supply All forms of direct and\nindirect price regulation and subsidies will be removed except what is covered\nin any Public Service Obligation compliant with the Power Sector Law and Energy\nCommunity obligations The implementation of the Albanian Market Model shall be\nenabled by the detailed market rules Its implementation will also enable Albania\nto comply with the commitments already undertaken or may ANALYSIS OF POLICIES &\nMAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 68 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA undertake in the framework of\ninternational and regional cooperation The competitive market will also\nfacilitate  future market coupling of Albanian market with other markets from\nneighboring countries With regard to RES electricity producers, the Market Model\nis expected to support schemes in compliance with the relevant Energy Community\nacquis in the form of contracts for difference (CfDs) that will replace their\ncurrent Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) BENEFITS OF  REGIONAL ELECTRICITY MARKET\nAnalysis of  coupled electricity market between Albania and Kosovo has been\nanalyzed and shown to provide the following benefits: \uf0b7 Improved security of\nelectricity supply, as Albania has almost 100% hydro capacities (strongly\nvulnerable to variable hydrological conditions) and Kosovo has almost 100%\nthermal capacities (partly very old and inflexible) The combined generation\ncapacity mix is approximately 50% hydro and 50% thermal, which is expected to\nimprove security of supply through more efficient use of cross-border capacity\nand price signals Based on the Memorandum of Understanding signed between\nAlbania and Kosovo both power systems are going to operate as  single bidding\nzone and are going to establish the efficient market \uf0b7 Efficient use of cross-\nborder capacity and increased welfare on both sides \uf0b7 Improved power system\ncontrol and system reserve synergies provided by the combination of thermal\n(base) and hydro (peaking) capacities \uf0b7 Improved investment climate to\nattractive potential generation investors The financial benefits associated with\nintegrating the Albania and Kosovo electricity markets were quantified based on\nthe savings that would come from the reduction of electricity imports and the\nadditional variable & costs for Kosovo Thermal Power Plants and the Drin River\nCascade HPPs The savings from reducing imports greatly overshadows the\nincremental operating costs for both the thermal and hydropower plants, and the\nnet financial benefit for both systems averages 75 million euros annually\nbetween 2017 and 2030, with  cumulative benefit of over  billion euro by In such\nan environment where system resources utilization and trading occur based on\nmarket-driven principles, Albania in the long term could attract further\ngeneration capacity investment in renewable energy given its hydropower\npotential, achieve  smarter diversity of supply sources through energy imports\nfrom other countries thermal generation, and improve its security of supply From\ntransmission infrastructure standpoint, such endeavors require the development\nof transmission interconnection between the concerned countries To that effect,\nthe projects mentioned below can be seen as part of the process to further\nintegrate Albania and other Contracting Parties within  larger regional\nelectricity market system: \uf0b7 Starting commercial operation of the 400KV\ninterconnection line between Tirana2 (Albania) and Kosova  (Kosovo), which\nshould increase the electrical energy exchange potential between the Albania and\nKosovo up to 600 MW This project was commissioned in June However, in order to\nmake this line operational the recognition by ENTSO- of Kosovo transmission\nsystem as  separate control area is needed \uf0b7 Construction of  400

INTEGRATION\nEVOLUTION IN ALBANIA With the intent of establishing  sustainable gas sector and\nachieve the objectives cited above, the government of Albania has been working\non the development of  Gas Master Plan18 of Albania This study concluded that\nAlbania can play  significant role in the development of  regional gas market\nwhile restoring and upgrading its national natural gas transmission and\ndistribution system The natural demographics of Albania present  challenge to\nthe development of  dense gas distribution network The country consists of\napproximately ,000 settlements with  small number of inhabitants per\nsettlements, administered under 12 administrative counties, which are divided\ninto 61 municipalities and 373 local government units (LGUs) As such attention\nmust be put on how to best develop  national distribution system that can have\nreasonable economies of scale Based on relevant criteria such as population\ndensity and distribution, the existence of anchor consumers ( power sector,\nindustrial users), the level of urbanization and the type of dwelling, the Gas\nMaster Plan found that it is not possible for Albania to develop  national gas\ntransmission and distribution network capable of covering all of its 373 LGUs\nwhile achieving significant economies of scale Alternatively, the solution with\nthe most economies scale achievement proposed for Albania is  gas transmission\nand distribution system that would allow the country to meet 77% of the\npotential national demand in 2020, growing to 82% of the potential gas demand by\nThe proposed gas transmission and distribution network which includes 85 viable\nLGUs ( viable coverage zone) covers 12% and 65% of the country\u2019 area and\npopulation respectively STATUS OF  NATIONAL GAS TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION\nNETWORK In order to have access to the regional and European gas infrastructure,\nAlbania needs to identify both legal works and infrastructure investments needed\nto gain that access In September 2015, Albania adopted the new Law on Natural\nGas Sector, which transposes provisions from the Third Energy Package In\nDecember 2016, the Government of Albania decided to separate the gas activities\nfrom the existing oil & gas public company ALBPETROL, creating  new public\ncompany, ALBGAZ, with the goal to play the role of the combined operator of\ntransmission and distribution According to Directive 2009/EC, and the Albanian\nLaw on Gas Sector, any gas TSO shall be fully unbundled from other activities,\nincluding ownership unbundling This means that the newly established company is\nrequired to be fully unbundled from the existing ALBPETROL to comply with the\nrequirements of the new Gas Sector Law It is obvious that any investment in the\ngas transmission and distribution networks shall be conditioned by the natural\ngas demand in country Challenges in gas sector include: 18 WBIF

geographical location within the Western Balkan region and\nbecome  key player in the development and deployment of  regional gas\ntransmission network for  sub-regional market19 In addition to the establishment\nof  national gas transmission and distribution network, the possibility of\nconnection to  wider regional network offers Albania the opportunity to develop\nsustainable gas sector and become part of  more robust gas market Development of\ndual national and regionally connected gas network infrastructure provides\nAlbania with more options towards building its natural gas supply portfolio\nwhile expanding its role as trading hub in the region Benefits for Contracting\nParties26 are achievable through several market integration options aiming at\nestablishing regional wholesale natural gas markets in South East Europe and\nCentral East Europe (SEE/CEE) and their further integration in the European\nUnion internal natural gas market Based on feasibility criteria including gas\nsources, interconnection, gas hub, timescale and consumption, Albania was found\nto be  critical node in the establishment of two possible market integration\noptions corridors in the South East Europe region, augmented by the development\nof LNG terminals These strategic projects include the Adriatic Integration\nCorridor and the Ukraine South Integration corridor The Adriatic Integration\ncorridor consists of  market integration option that involves Albania and\nMontenegro with Croatia, Italy, Greece, and Bulgaria While it offers high\npotential to access different supply sources for the Contracting Parties along\nthe Ionian and Adriatic Seas, this market integration option will only deliver\nits full benefits when all needed and planned infrastructure projects critical\nto its implementation are completed From an Albania perspective, it is worth\nnoting that this market integration option would solve the natural gas supply\nimbalance in the country, while allowing the country to become  natural trading\nhub for the region On the implementation side, portion of the Trans Adriatic\nPipeline (TAP) is under construction TAP\u2019 route through Albania is around 271\nkilometers, of which 211 kilometers is onshore and 60 kilometers is offshore\nSome advantages of TAP for the region include: \uf0b7 Independent, non-discriminatory\nand open for third

benefits when\nall needed and planned infrastructure critical to its implementation is\ncompleted This market integration option would also solve the natural capacity\nsupply imbalance in the country, while allowing the country to become  natural\ntrading hub for the region As mentioned previously, the market integration\noptions described above are part of  gas infrastructure development framework\nthat would benefit from additional gas supply projects in the form of LNG\nterminals recently considered and under construction These LNG terminal projects\nhave been found to benefit

and\namended it on June 2016  specific law (Law no 9876, dated 2008) on biofuels and\nother renewable fuels used for transport The purpose of this new law is to\npromote production and use of biofuels and other renewable combustibles used for\nreplacement of oil by-products in the transport sector, in order to help reduce\nGHG emissions, promote the cultivation of energy crops and to protect the\nenvironment The law transposes the former EU Directive 2003/EC of May , 2003 on\npromotion of biofuels or other renewable fuels used for transport The law on\nbiofuels has established specific targets for using of biofuels in\ntransportation sector, and according to the law on renewables these targets are\nintegrated into the overall target for renewables in the total final energy\nconsumption in the country According to the law on renewables, implementation of\nthe NREAP will be monitored by the agency responsible for the renewable energy\nsources, which is expecting to have authority and competencies in monitoring the\ncompliance with the targets established for all renewables including biofuels At\nthe same time, the new law on biofuels will confer to the Agency responsible for\nrenewables the responsibility for monitoring and verifying the compliance of\nbiofuel producers with the sustainability criteria established in the law The\nadministration and

law, while the exemption from custom duties\nis applied at the moment that the machinery and equipment enter the border of\nAlbania As mentioned above, despite the fact that the law requires that the\nCouncil of Minister, upon the joint proposal of the Ministers responsible for\nenergy and transport, approves the minimum percentage of biofuels to be used in\ntransport sector in  year, no such annual obligations have been established On\nthe other hand, the amendment to the law on biofuels approved in October 2014,\nremoved all biofuels and other RES fuels used in transportation sector from the\nexcise tax till 2018 with the objective to make these fuels competitive in the\nmarket However, transposing the section of biofuels in the EU RES Directive 2009\ninto  new law on biofuels in Albania remains one of the future actions in this\nsector 14 EU BIOFUEL MARKET - PRODUCTION, SUPPLY AND DEMAND Biodiesel is also\nthe most important biofuel in the EU and, the EU is the world\u2019 largest biodiesel\nproducer Biodiesel has been used in the EU transport sector since the 1990s,\nduring which time, rapid expansion was driven by increasing crude oil prices,\nprovisions for the production of oilseeds under Common Agricultural Policy set-\naside programs, and generous tax incentives, mainly in Germany and France The\nstructure of the EU biodiesel sector is very diverse and plant sizes range from\nan annual capacity of 250,000 tons owned by  group of farmers to ,000,000 tons\nowned by  large multi-national company EU biodiesel production capacity is\nexpected to increase to billion liters (million tons) in 2017, when  new\nbiodiesel facility in France is expected to start production Biodiesel\nproduction facilities exist in every EU member state with the exception of\nLuxemburg Demand for biofuels in Albania is based on the NREAP biofuel target,\nwhich is approximately 53 ktoe for the year 2020 (108,000 tons per year) There\nis currently one biodiesel plant in Albania located in Porto Romano, which is\nnear Durres, and has  production capacity of 000 tons per year of biodiesel and\n20,000 tons per year in glycerin The Plant is connected through  pipeline with\nthe Porto Romano Port infrastructure, and it is connected by land through the\nmain highway of the country This biodiesel refinery has the capacity to supply\nbiofuels to the market in Albania, and this plant could cover the supplies\nneeded to meet the RES transport targets until In addition, the plant will have\nan initial surplus production that could be traded to neighboring countries like\nKosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia, which for time being do not have such\nrefineries Albania has no possibility to export to EU countries since the unit\ncost of biodiesel production in Albania is high compared to EU producer since\nthe plant capacity in Porto Romano is  to 10 times lower than average EU\u2019 plant\ncapacities ANALYSIS OF POLICIES & MAIN PRODUCTS PAGE 79 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR\nALBANIA  FINANCIAL RESOURCES  INTRODUCTION The National Strategy of Energy is\nmultidimensional strategy with  long-term planning horizon (2014- 2030) that\ninvolves  considerable number of sectors and sub-sectors, policies and results\nThis chapter aims to identify the financial resources that are likely to be\nrequired for implementation of the policies, objectives and results that have\nbeen identified in this Strategy Given the uncertainties inherent is developing\nan energy strategy, the investment funding needs for each scenario were\ndeveloped in general terms from the LEAP model scenario results and specific\nsectoral cost parameters This chapter describes how these financial requirements\nwere estimated, and presents  detailed breakdown by sector The total investment\nneeds can be sourced directly from private investors (foreign and domestic),\ndonor institutions, and public institutions, including public funding from the\nstate budget The investment contributions can take the form of grants, loans and\nother anticipated capital, operational and major technical assistance funding\nThe estimates that follow include all the sources that fulfil the investment\nfunding needs It is expected that the National Energy Strategy will have\nminimal influence on the distribution of public expenditures, and that the\nrequired investments are mostly likely to come from private sources, development\nbanks, foreign technical assistance and finally from the state budget To that\nend, it is intended that proposed financial instruments do not have, or have\nminimal influence on the competitive market conditions in the context of free\nmarket access and development of sustainable market prices, with no cross-\nsubsidization and compliance with EU rules on state aid if such is applied Due\nto the fact that this National Strategy of Energy extends over the period of\n2018 to 2030, it is likely that unforeseen developments may occur during the\nyears to come, not only to identified objectives, which may be achieved earlier\nthan planned, but also to new challenges which may arise in the future\nTherefore, existing planned resources may need to shift from one budget program\nto the other, or new resources may need to be committed according to new needs\nThis chapter quantifies the likely capital investment expenditures over time and\nwill serve as  reference document guiding future government spending plans In\nthe meantime, the existing staff of the responsible institutions in most cases\nwill be directly responsible for the implementation of the necessary operational\nmeasures  METHODOLOGY This financial chapter covers the required investments for\nall sectors of the Albanian energy system: power sector (generation,\ntransmission and distribution), natural gas supply (transmission and\ndistribution), crude oil (exploration, production, refining and distribution),\nenergy efficiency investment for all sectors and investment for all renewable\nenergy sources  POWER SECTOR In order to meet the growing demand for electricity\nand reduce the level of import, different scenarios have been prepared through\nthe Albania-LEAP model and it has served to identify  new power plant expansion\nplan for each scenario based on  minimal cost of generation approach The\ngeneration FINANCIAL RESOURCES PAGE 80 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA investment\ncost is determined from the investment costs for each power plant in the\nexpansion plan and are based on current Albanian data according to many\nfeasibility study for SHPPs, medium and large HPPs, WPPs, PvPP, Natural Gas CCs\nand GTs, using average figures for the specific investments for the respective\ntechnologies The investment cost for expansion of the high voltage transmission\nsystem, including 400 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV networks, is based on the cost\ninformation contained in the Electricity Demand Forecast by OST, which were used\nto determine average the system expansion cost as  function of the overall\nincrease in electricity consumption, which is specific to each scenario\nInvestment costs for the distribution system include: ) upgrading the sub-\ntransmission distribution system to improve reliability; ) targeted investments\nin the medium voltage grid (-20 kV); ) customer metering ) system metering for\nthe low voltage network; and ) upgrading of the company\u2019 management information\nand billing and collection system The basic investment data was taken from an\nongoing project of OSHEE and WB/IBRD regarding improvements to the distribution\nand transmission system Table 14 provides the cumulative power sector\ninvestments for 2018 to 2030, expressed in million Euros (MEUR), for generation,\ntransmission, and distribution for the Baseline, EE, RES, and Combined scenarios\nFor the Natural Gas Promotion scenario, the power sector investment requirements\nfollow the Baseline scenario, and are not shown in the table Table 22 provides\nthe annual investment profile for each scenario Table 14: Power Sector\nInvestment for 2018 \u2013 2030 (MEUR) Power Activities Sector

existing oil fields and new ones The Strategy takes into\naccount the current domestic import, and identifies the internal infrastructure\nof crude oil and oil by products transport, product stocking, and modern\nstandards management needed to reach  minimal cost of service for oil and oil\nbyproducts and avoid temporary market abnormalities The investments required for\nexploration and oil production are based on information from AKBN for existing\nand new oil fields The Strategy supports the rehabilitation of Ballsh and Fier\nrefineries to European norms and standards, including adoption of environmental\nnorms (below % sulphur) for refinery products and technology, increasing\nrefinery processing capacity to  Mt/year, modernization of Vlora terminal, and\nmodernization of transport infrastructure from Vlora to Ballsh Investment costs\nfor rehabilitation and modernization of the two refineries depends directly on\nthe actual situation of installations, equipment and environment pollution level\nMinistry of Energy and Industry also is considering the option of building new\nrefineries with  Million tons capacities Estimates for the investment cost\nrequired for rehabilitation of the existing refineries and constructing new\nrefineries are based on information from AKBN Fuel oil by product market\ninfrastructure in Albania includes  large number of distributors, and the total\nnumber of retail stations should be reduced and better optimized according to\nEuropean norms and standards The investment required for improvements to the\ndownstream infrastructure for oil by- products are also based on information\nfrom AKBN Table 16 provides the cumulative oil sector investment costs for 2018\nto 2030, expressed in million Euros (MEUR), for

SUPPORT Measures\nundertaken during the 1st NEEAP were predominantly done with either the direct\nsupport of an international financing institution (IFI) or donor, or were\nprovided via local commercial bank loans supported by an IFI or donor This\nsupport came both via financial and technical means according to the analysis\ncarried out and presented under the 2nd and 3rd NEEAP Such international support\nmay continue, but to scale-up energy efficiency actions requires that increased\ndomestic funds (public and private) are made available In order to realize many\nof the efficiency measures, the EE law calls for development of an Energy\nEfficiency Fund, as  mechanism of financial support for the implementation of EE\nprojects in the public and private sectors Financing of the Energy Efficiency\nFund is foreseen to come from the Albanian state budget (limited to public\nawareness campaigns and pilot projects pursued in the public sector), external\ndonors, the fund\u2019 activities and offered services The Energy Efficiency Fund\naims to provide financial support and project management for developing  market\nof energy efficiency improvement and supporting programs for final customers\nwith high-cost and high-risk investments The Fund will be used to promote energy\nefficiency improvement programs, energy service companies, independent energy\nexperts, energy auditors, energy distributors, distribution system operators,\nretail energy sales companies and installers of efficient equipment  competitive\nbidding process should be used for fund allocation and for selection of third\nparties to carry out awareness campaign and pilot projects based on the\nlegislation and procedures defined under the EE Fund Procedures, which also\nshould be in line with Public Procurement Law The Energy Efficiency Fund will in\nitself have limited financial means for achieving all the objectives noted\nwithin the second NEEAP The funding proposed from the State Budget should be\nseen as  tool to leverage greater resources from external parties (IFI and\ndonors as well as private banks) To do this the EE Fund, in addition to direct\nfinancing, has the option of providing loan guarantees, subordinate debt,\ninvestment gap financing or interest-rate buy-downs To reach the EE Target of  %\nenergy savings for the year 2020,  ballpark estimate of approximately 100 MEUR\nadded investment was calculated assuming an average investment cost per energy\nsaved of 05 Euro/kWh The biggest part of such investment will be direct\nfinancing, with the option of providing loan guarantees, subordinated debt,\ninvestment gap financing or interest-rate buy-downs, and the main task of the\nstate budget is to carry out awareness campaign and pilot projects to promote EE\nin all economic sectors FINANCIAL RESOURCES PAGE 83 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA\nTable 17 provides the cumulative public sector investment costs for 2018 to\n2030, expressed in million Euros (MEUR), for EE awareness campaigns and pilot\nprojects, and Table 25 provides the annual investment profile for each component\nTable 17: Public Sector Investment In EE Awareness Campaigns and Pilot Projects\n2018 \u2013 2030 (MEUR) EE Activity MEUR Implementation of NEEAP measures through the\nawareness campaign and pilot projects Total  RES SUPPORT The financial support\nto RES power producers is provided through two schemes: ) Contract for\ndifferences (feed-in tariffs) for Priority RES producers with installed capacity\nup to 15 MW and ii) Tax exemption With the approval of the new law on renewable,\nand the new Market Model, only the small RES Producers with installed capacity\nup to  MW (PV) and  MW (Wind) will continue to benefit from the feed-in tariffs,\nwhile other Priority RES Producers with installed capacity from  to 15MW will be\nsubject of feed-in premium provided through the CfD applied for them in the day\nahead market Therefore, this RES support is covered by final customers through\ndedicated surcharge in their final rates, and the primary state budget funding\nto be allocated for RES support will go towards awareness campaigns and pilot\nprojects, which indirectly will assist to achieve the national RES target Table\n18 provides the cumulative public sector investment costs for 2018 to 2030,\nexpressed

(MEURO)\nSTATE BUDGET AND PUBLIC INVESTMENT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR EACH SECTOR Estimates of\nthe state budget and public investment contribution for each energy sector\nrequired to reach the identified strategic objectives have been calculated based\non the following assumptions: \uf0b7 Total investment for generation (including RES\nPlants and Natural Gas CCGTs) will be based on the private initiatives KESH\nshould support not only rehabilitation projects of the existing generation\nassets, but the construction of new capacities as well KESH shall support not\nonly rehabilitation projects of the existing generation assets, but the\nconstruction of new capacities as well KESH will continue to support only\nrehabilitation of Drin River Cascade based on the ongoing project ; Based on the\nWB study, KESH sh has prepared  project proposal for the Development of HEC\nSkavica (Feasibility Study, business model and socio-economic assessment) which,\nafter being included in the National Strategic Package in  by the National\nFINANCIAL RESOURCES PAGE 85 ENERGY STRATEGY FOR ALBANIA Investment Council, has\nbeen submitted for review and support to the Western Balkans Investment

grant at EUR  million (Project Code: WB17-ALB-\nENE-03) Also, additional investment identified for the conversion of Vlora TPP\ninto gas fired technology \uf0b7 Transmission, Distribution of Electricity,\nExploration and Production of Crude Oil, Rehabilitation of Ballsh & Fier\nRefineries will be based on the general assumption considering that each\ninvestment will have  structure of the capital as follows: equity contribution\nfrom OST and OSHEE will be % of total specific required investment and the rest\nwill covered from the IFIs and possibly from private banks; \uf0b7 Natural

meaningfully applied political will, coordination of\nall energy related stakeholders within the country, and cooperation with\nAlbania\u2019 development partners Furthermore, successful implementation depends on\nthe commitment of private investors, donors, public energy companies and state\nbudget resources, and the cost-effective management of these resources within\nstate institutions to achieve the expected results, outcomes, and impacts\nSuccessful implementation of the National Energy Strategy depends on sound\ngovernance, clearly defined accountabilities, transparency, and the ongoing\nparticipation of  wide range of institutions within the government and\nexternally Reporting, monitoring and evaluation analysis are essential for an\nefficient and timely implementation of the National Energy Strategy, and this\nchapter identifies  set of clearly defined metrics for monitoring of the Energy\nStrategy\u2019 main objectives These monitoring metrics build upon the strategic\nobjectives discussed in section  and the strategic metrics discussed in section\nto provide  clear basis for monitoring Albania\u2019 progress towards implementing\nthis Energy Strategy  MONITORING INDICATORS The monitoring metrics will be\nmeasured through specific indicators, which were selected from the respective\nindicators used for the National Strategy for Development and Integration , RES\nTargets, EE Targets and NDC Targets already committed to by the Albanian\nGovernment until Implementation of the Strategy will be monitored through and\nbenchmarked against  set of thirteen monitoring indicators, which are generally\navailable on an annual basis These monitoring indicators are listed below: \uf0b7\nReduction of transmission technical electricity losses; \uf0b7 Reduction of\ndistribution non-technical electricity losses; \uf0b7 Reduction of distribution\ntechnical electricity losses; \uf0b7 Increasing rate of electricity collection; \uf0b7\nLevel of cross-subsidies in energy supply \uf0b7 Rate of switching the supplier \uf0b7\nOpening of electricity market (percentage of energy supplied from the\ncompetitive market - both domestic and from imports); \uf0b7 Self-sufficiency of\ndomestic primary energy produced versus total primary energy supply \uf0b7 Imports of\nenergy ; \uf0b7 National

Information will be collected for the\nrespective monitoring indicators in accordance with the type of intervention\nMonitoring data should be collected annually, and some of this data will be\ninserted into the Yearly Energy Balance, which is prepared and updated by the\nMinistry of Energy and Industry through AKBN  functional task of AKBN will be\nmaking requests for data that are to be generated by all public and private\nenergy companies, and carrying out surveys for determining the level of\nconsumption among various energy demand sectors The data collected will be\nconfirmed and transferred in EUROSTAT Energy Balance Template, where data will\nbe processed and systemized in tables with the monitoring indicators All\nmonitoring indicators will be part of the annual monitoring report, which will\nbe submitted for decision-making to the Ministry of Energy and Industry, and\nthen sent officially to the Council of Ministers Table 30 presents an initial\nset of monitoring indicators, which includes their baseline values (for the year\n2015), short-term goals (2020), medium term goals (2025) and long term goals\n(2030) The annual reports shall address
