prepare its first NECP  during the\nyear The development period had to be extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic This\nNECP builds on the National Energy Strategy and the first NDC and has been\naligned with the draft of the revised NDC Differences compared to the existing\npolicy documents have been analysed and can be attributed to, among others, the\nneed for adjustments due to the evolving knowledge base Detailed explanation is\nprovided in chapter  Drafting the NECP calls for  broad range of reliable and\nconsistent data The most relevant data on climate change have been collected and\nprocessed by the UNDP technical assistance projects during the preparation of\nthe National Communications to UNFCCC With regard to the NECP drafting process,\naccessibility of data and the level of detail was not always ideal due to\ndifferent procedures and timelines Despite of these challenges, good progress\nhas been made with alignment of NECP and NDC for future progress reports and\nupdates Nevertheless, formal actions are necessary to ensure disaggregated data\ncollection, data consistency and data transparency for future activities\nPolitical, economic, environmental, and social context of the plan Political\ncontext: It can be summarized that there is policy and legislation in place for\neach of the five dimensions of the Energy Union Albania is involved in the\nprocess of creating  supportive domestic energy market, ensuring energy\nsecurity, energy efficiency, environmental protection including GHG emissions\nreduction which are described and presented through so many planned measures and\ninvestments identified in different policy documents The National Strategy of\nEnergy, 2nd and 3rd Action plan on EE, Consolidated Renewable Energy Action\nPlan, National Plan for the Mitigation of GHG and the Strategy of Transport have\ndefined objectives and targets on increasing the security of supply by\ninvestments in the power sector, gas penetration in the Albanian market,\nincreasing the share of RES and EE followed by  reduction of GHG emissions The\nlaw no155 on Climate Change has created the basis for transposition of the\nGovernance Regulation and the relevant EU legislation on climate change For the\nfull implementation and enforcement of energy and climate policies, the\nsecondary legislation on energy efficiency including the energy performance in\nbuildings is fully adopted during 2020 and the secondary legislation on\nrenewable energy sources is still in the process of being drafted or drafting\nneeds to be started The institutional setup for planning and reporting energy\nand climate related policies and measures is under development The following\ninstitutions and professions that have been establish by law need still  to be\nestablished in practice: Renewable Energy Agency1, Renewable Energy Operator,\nEnergy Services Companies, Electro energetic companies, Hydrocarbons Scientific\nInstitute, Natural gas operators Economic context: The development and\nimplementation of the national energy policies and establishing the NECP will\nimpact significantly on the economic growth in different economic sectors Many\ninvestments foreseen to be realised in whole energy sector will have  very great\nimpact to increase the sectorial GDPs, generating revenues and the increase in\nlabour forces in different areas Policies and measures related with the\nconstruction and renovation of buildings as well as the construction of\nPhotovoltaic systems will contribute substantially to creating green jobs\nReduced dependence on energy imports will not only contribute to improving the\nsecurity of energy supply but also to macroeconomic and political security of\nthe country through decreasing the domestic budget deficit Environmental\ncontext: Albania\u2019 energy policies pursue three objectives: ) ii) iii) support\nfor the overall economic development, increase of the security of energy supply,\nprotection of environment Renewable energy especially other than hydro is\nsolution for decreasing the strategic dependence on energy imports and\nmitigating the impact of climate change resulting in unreliable hydropower\nproduction However, there are conflicts of interest with environmental\nprotection goals, which must be handled properly Social context: The increase of\nemployment mainly through investments in the energy and building sector led to\nthe increase of the personal/families revenues followed by the increase of\nliving standard of the society There is  strong connection between personal and\nsociety welfare which means that investments create not only jobs but they have\ntheir impact on municipalities and governmental revenues through taxes, fees,\netc and their use in budgeting forms to be spent for purposes such as health,\neducation, etc Specifically, targets on Energy Efficiency aim at the reduction\nof energy consumption per unit and thus at  contribution to affordable energy\nsupply and reducing the poverty  Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the\nEnergy Union The five dimensions of the Energy Union are: () energy security;\n(ii) the internal energy market; (iii) energy efficiency (iv) decarbonisation;\nand () research, innovation and competitiveness The strategy relating to the\nfive dimensions of the Energy Union rests on four pillars: () To discuss and\nreview sectoral targets, policies and measures in order to identify gaps and\nsynergies, especially with regard to alleviating energy poverty and providing\naffordable energy for people, and with regard to job creation Therefore, an\nimportant focus is on financing measures () To make high-quality quantitative\ndata available as far as possible They must be provided in detail as much as\npossible to support the process of analyzing and getting results needed for in-\ndepth analyses, planning and monitoring in different energy-related sectors 1So\nfar this role is being carried by the NANR It has not been defined yet which is\nthe agency that will permanently take over its responsibilities  () To\nstreamline processes of data collection, documentation, and reporting, in order\nto limit the burden on public administration responsible for these tasks This is\ngeneral concern and therefore also applies to, but is not limited to, the\ndevelopment of the NECP () To create awareness and acceptance of the NECP among\nall stakeholder groups by organising public information and consultation\nprocedures The basis for this is the establishment of  coordination structure\nand  coordination procedure across different ministries and departments playing\nrole in the five dimensions of the Energy Union The Inter-Ministerial Energy and\nClimate Committee (IECC) has been established to ensure that developed targets,\npolicies and measures will be feasible and realistic in terms of implementation\nand expected impact at national level The development of the NECP is regarded as\nan open-ended management process based on continuous improvement Especially the\nsituation regarding data availability is challenging and has been identified as\nhigh priority field of action in order to improve future versions of the NECP\nOverview table with key objectives, policies and measures of the plan An\noverview table with key policies and measures is provided in chapter  (Table 11:\nOverview table of key policies affecting the national climate target to 2030)\nThe analytical basis of the NECP (chapters  and ) explains that targets are\ninfluenced mainly by the mode of operation of renewable plants, the reduction of\nfossil fuel use in transport and industry by fuel switch and energy efficiency\nmeasures targeting the building sector Furthermore, forestry management has\nmajor influence Targets to be achieved by 2030 are presented in the table below\nTargets (2030) and reference Sector contribution GHG emission savings

sub-sectors3: Security of supply and (Energy) infrastructure\nEnergy market regulation Energy efficiency \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 Hydrocarbon \uf0b7 Renewable\nenergy The national energy system in terms of supply and demand and the main\nchallenges it faces are briefly described below In  nutshell, import dependence\nand high distribution losses in the electricity grid are challenges to be dealt\nwith Plans to increase the use of natural gas must be carefully developed and\naligned with other plans, to ensure that GHG and final energy reduction targets\nand EE improvement targets will be achieved Albania depends almost exclusively\non hydropower for its electricity generation (98% of its electricity generation\ncomes from hydropower), making it increasingly vulnerable to unfavourable\nhydrological conditions in the summer, especially in view to predicted effects\nof climate change in the Western Balkans region Apart from the fact that there\nis no constant production, electricity from hydropower is not sufficient to meet\nthe needs Albania is  net importer of electricity and ensuring the security of\nits power supply is  challenge Thus, Albania started to plan adequate measures\nto increase investments in renewable energy projects other than hydropower Due\nto the fall in technology costs and significant renewable energy potential that\nthe country has, wind and solar PV can be deployed cost-effectively to mitigate\nthe impact on the end-consumer electricity price By the end of 2018, there were\nadditional 10 MW of solar PV installed For the years , the Consolidated\nRenewable Energy Action Plan foresees the expansion of installed electricity\ngenerators based on renewable sources by 738 MW, as follows: 57 MW of hydropower\nenergy; 490 MW of photovoltaic energy; 150 MW of wind energy; 41 MW of MNU\n(waste to energy) The related additional potential for renewable generation in\nAlbania is estimated 1761 GWh (Source: The Consolidated Renewable Energy Action\nPlan 2019 - 2020) However, especially regarding concession contracts to build\nand operate HPP, doubts have been expressed about the quality of SEAs and EIAs\ncarried out on energy projects Overall, implementation of energy projects lags\nfar behind schedule which needs to be addressed in strategic planning Table\nshows the slow development of non-hydropower in renewable power capacities\nReferring to the National Sector Strategy for Energy (NSSE)   Referring to the\nlaw on Power sector, other subsector laws and NSSE   Year 2017 Total installed\npower ,145 MW

page 24) The\nVlora thermal power plant (built with financing from the EBRD of EUR 40 million,\nEIB financing of EUR 40 million, and WB* financing of EUR million) has never\nbeen put into operation since its completion in This is due to  failure in the\nplant\u2019 cooling system that has not been repaired The conversion of the Vlora\npower plant from oil use to gas use once it is connected to the TAP is\nencouraged This would contribute to stabilizing the generation of electricity\nduring droughts in the southern part of Albania However, this will increase gas\nconsumption and thus also CO2 emissions and must be taken into account\naccordingly in strategic planning Structure of the Albanian energy system In\ngraphical way, we are introducing the structure of the Albanian energy system:\nIn terms of Gross inland consumption (to be confirmed) 2019, the Albanian energy\nsystem has been dominated and still continues to be dominated by oil by products\nfor transport use (appr %), followed by electricity produced from hydropower\n(appr 17%), and in the third place is biomass (fuelwood, appr %) used for\nheating, cooking and domestic hot water Fuelwood is mostly used in household\n(rural areas) and in the service sector (Figure ) Gross Inland Consumption\n(Ktoe) 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 -00 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018

energy\nsystem must be developed towards  diversified energy system using alternative\nenergy resources like gas and renewables with less GHG emissions, and\nimplementation of energy efficiency measures - based on cost effectiveness The\nsystem must rely on domestic production and being affordable for consumers by\ncreating an impact on poverty reduction Figure  shows the import dependence of\nthe energy system The share of import in percentage of the Gross Inland\nConsumption is high, thus affecting the security of supply The energy system\nneeds to be more diversified and more efficient, also due to increase of self-\nsufficiency energy demand                                       ( % ) 00 00 26\n57 92 72 53 20 23 88 90 00 00 00 00 00 84 82 91 17 07 53 01 2004 2005 2006

II) which is aligned to the United Nations\u2019\nSustainable Development Goals; the obligations arising from the signature of the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); the Energy and\nClimate Acquis of the Energy Community Sustainable Development Goals The second\nNational Strategy for Development and Integration (NSDI II) presents the\nnational vision for the social and economic development of Albania over the\nperiod 2014 to 2020 as the main visionary and planning document of the country\nand is explicitly aligned to the SDGs While the intention is to maximize the\nutilization of indicators adopted at the global level, the vision is also to\nmaximize the use of indicators that would be most relevant to Albania4 Referring\nto Sustainable Development Goals, the SDG - Affordable and Clean Energy, calls\nfor ensuring universal access to modern energy services, improving energy\nefficiency and increasing the share of renewable energy According to INSTAT, the\nrelevant energy supply indicators measuring SDG7 in Albania are: \uf0b7 By 2030,\nensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services \uf0b7\nProportion of population with access to electricity is 100% \uf0b7 Proportion of\npopulation with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology is 38%\n4Environmental Performance Reviews , UNECE  The challenges currently facing the\nAlbanian energy sector include: \uf0b7 Meeting the energy demand for  sustainable\neconomic development in different sectors and the growing level of energy\nconsumption per capita; Improving the trend of energy intensity reduction; \uf0b7 \uf0b7\nEnhancing the security of energy supply by improving energy efficiency,\nincreasing the share of renewables and other indigenous energy sources, and\nincreasing welfare through regional cooperation and integration; \uf0b7 Continue\ninvestments to further improve the performance by reducing distributions losses\nin the grid and improve collection rates United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change During the last two decades, Albania has paid special attention\nto environmental protection in general and climate change in particular The\nAlbanian Constitution itself has included \u201c healthy and ecologically adequate\nenvironment for present and future generation\u201d as one of the social objectives\nthat need to be taken into consideration by all state institutions Albania is\nsignatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),\nadopted at the \u201cRio Earth Summit\u201d in 1992 and ratified by the Albanian\nParliament in 1994, which established the objective to combat climate change by\nstabilizing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere and limiting average global\ntemperature increases to support sustainable development Albania has started the\nprocess of changing the status from  developing country to  developed country,\nin the context of the UNFCCC This process is an integral part of the process of\nintegration into the EU and involves the development of capacities at the\nnational level for monitoring and annual reporting of Greenhouse Gases (GHG),\nthe formulation and implementation of policies for GHG emission reduction and\nclimate change adaptation, and the transposition and implementation of the EU\nAcquis on climate change In order to achieve the emission reduction objectives,\nthe Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015 and ratified by the Albanian\nParliament through law No 75 dated 2016, establishes  \u201cbottom up system\u201d where\nParties have to prepare and communicate successive nationally determined\ncontributions (NDC) every five years with the aim of progressively improving\ntheir efforts In addition to their NDC, Parties should also formulate long-term,\nmid-century low GHG development strategies, and submit them by 2020 that\ndemonstrate how their efforts will contribute to the goal of zero-net emissions\nby the second half of this century The next NDC update is due by 2020, and the\nNECP development process should be in line with the NDC update process In 2014\nthe Order of the Prime Minister No 155, dated 2014 established an inter-\nministerial working group on the coordination of the Ministries tasks, according\nto the country\u2019 obligations on UNFCCC The group, chaired by the Deputy Minister\nof Environment, includes the representatives of 12 Albanian Ministries The group\nhas the mandate, among others, to draft policies and strategies, and to ensure\ninter-institutional coordination for the implementation of climate change\nactivities Energy and Climate Acquis of the Energy Community Although Albania is\nmaking progress with transposing and implementing the Acquis, crucial points\nremain: \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 the reliability of the energy database and the need for macro-\neconomic data in much more detail in order to improve analyses, in-depth reviews\nand monitoring of the action plans and strategies related with energy; the low\nimplementation of legislation and strategic documents; the need for  financial\nframework for implementing policy measures 10 Non-implementation of previous\nNEAPs or EE legislation was linked with lack of  financial framework for\nimplementation (EE fund or dedicated state financing) To avoid this risk,\nsetting up financing mechanisms for NECP implementation is the key to success In\nview of the very high investment costs and the long periods of time required to\nrealise investments across the energy sector, strategic investments in RES and\nRE are becoming key issues in terms of increasing security of supply, reducing\nemissions and adapting energy demand on the basis of least cost planning\nTransposition of EU Directives under the Energy Community Acquis Information\nabout the status of transposition and implementation of Directives is provided\nin the chapters of the respective Dimension Albania has prepared and adopted\nnumber of policy documents, strategies and action plans aligned with the Energy\nand Climate Acquis of the Energy Community The main energy-related policy\ndocuments are described below: \uf0b7 National Sector Strategy for Energy , approved\nby DCM No 480 dated 2018 is the core strategic document for the country\u2019 energy\nsector clearly defining national energy targets until \uf0b7 Strategic Plan for\nReform in Energy Sector in Albania (), approved by DCM No 742, dated 2018, is\nroadmap for reforming the entire electricity sector in Albania It is the basis\nfor the Policy-Based Loan (PBL) for the implementation of the specific Policy\nReforms Elements (18 PREs) listed in this Strategic Plan \uf0b7 Albania\u2019 Economic\nReform Programme () related to energy sector reforms includes the following: ()\nEffective liberalization of the energy market, with complete unbundling and\nfunctioning power exchange; (ii) Implementation of the law on renewable energy\nsources; (iii) Adoption of the secondary legislation for the laws on energy\nefficiency and the energy performance of buildings \uf0b7 NEEAP 2nd and 3rd has set\nup some objectives and targets up to 2020, EE measures, investments and\nresponsible institutions \uf0b7 National Consolidated Renewable Energy Action Plan\n(NCREAP 2019 \u2013 2020) approved by DCM No 580 dated 2018, foresees an average\nincrease of electricity generators from renewable sources of 738 MW out of which\n490 MW from photovoltaic (PV) and 150 MW from Wind Power  Current energy and\nclimate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy\nUnion Overview of key policies National Energy Strategy for Albania The Energy\nStrategy for Albania , as the core strategic document for the country\u2019 energy\nsector, is fully coherent with other national policies and strategies and the\nEuropean Green Deal\u2019 objectives: Supplying clean, affordable and secure energy;\nBuilding and renovating, promoting  cleaner construction sector; Accelerating\nthe shift to sustainable and smart mobility; Eliminating pollution through\nmeasures to cut pollution rapidly and efficiently The five dimensions which the\nenergy strategy supports are:  Energy security, based on diversification of\nenergy resources;  Full integration in the regional market and later to the\nEuropean one;  Energy efficiency which contributes to the moderation of demand;\nDecarbonization of the economy;  Research, innovation and competition 11 The\nAlbanian Energy Strategy is fully in line and in harmony with EU \u201cLow-carbon\nEconomy Roadmap\u201d and promotes EE, RES and natural gas policies that promote\nstable business climate which will encourage low-carbon investments for the\nperiod 2017-As the analyses supporting this strategy shows, there is\nsignificantly greater GHG reduction potential in the Albanian energy system than\nthe initial NDC commitment Therefore, the energy strategy and the policy\nobjectives it envisions are in-line with the increasing ambition goals of both\nthe UNFCCC and the EU/Energy Community Given the current status of Albania as\ncandidate country in accession to the EU, it is likely during the period covered\nby this strategy Albania will accede to the EU For this reason, as well as\nrequired by its Energy Community membership, it is of great importance that the\nEnergy Strategy is in line also with EU Climate Change Policy by ensuring that\nthe energy policy objectives and the respective energy action plans identified\nin this document are supporting the levels of ambition expressed in EU CO2\nreduction targets and climate change political goals The figure below shows\nother key policies in the form of an overview  more detailed description can be\nfound in those dimensions for which the respective policy instruments are\nparticularly important Figure : Overview of policy documents (Source:\nConsolidation of climate planning processes in the Energy Community Contracting\nParties, New Climate Institute, May 2019) 12 Overview of governmental\ninstitutions The most significant institutions in setting policy and regulation\nin the power sector in Albania are the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy\n(\u201cMIE\u201d) and the Energy Regulatory Authority (\u201cERE\u201d) In addition to MIE and ERE\nthere are  number of ministries that have  smaller role in the sector, and also\nnumber of government agencies with responsibilities with respect to the power\nsector that are delegated to them by the ministries These are: Ministry of\nFinance and Economy (\u201cMFE\u201d), Ministry for Health and Social Welfare, Ministry of\nTourism and Environment (\"MTE\") and government agencies and companies involved\nin energy supply, as shown in the figure below  detailed description of the\npresented organisations is available in the Annex Figure : Organigram of\ngovernmental institutions involved in NECP development and implementation\nDimension Decarbonisation \u2013 GHG emissions and removals Key policies are the INDC\nand the National Strategy for the Climate Change INDC (Intended Nationally\nDetermined Contributions) Though Albania is  country with  low-carbon economy,\nthe INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) of Albania commits to\nreduce its CO2 emissions by % as compared to the baseline scenario for the\nperiod 2016 to This reduction is equivalent to  CO2 emission reduction of 708 Gg\nby The emission trajectory of Albania allows  smooth trend for achieving  tons\nof GHG emissions per capita by 2050, which can be taken as  target for global\ncontraction and convergence of greenhouse gas emissions The main mechanisms of\nachieving this objective are related to maintaining the low-level greenhouse\ngases emissions from energy production sector and developing low carbon policies\nin order to prevent the increase of greenhouse gases emissions from other\nsectors of the economy All sectors need to contribute to the low-carbon\ntransition according to their technological and economic potential The EU Low\nCarbon Economy Roadmap calls for actions in all main sectors responsible for\nEurope' emissions \u2013 power generation, industry, transport,

their implementation The National Strategy for Energy (NSE)\n2018\u20132030 has defined the key institutions and power sector companies in\nAlbania, responsible for its implementation: \uf0b7 Government and regulatory actors,\nwhich include government bodies - ministries, the regulator, 22 agencies to whom\nministries delegate specific sector responsibilities; \uf0b7 State owned companies,\nsuch as KESH, OST, and OSHEE, which are currently major players in the energy\nsector in Albania and specifically in relation to the EE investments; \uf0b7\nMunicipalities for their specific duties which concern and relate to the EE\nmeasures implementations The MIE, together with ERE, NANR, and the AEE are\nresponsible for monitoring and ensuring an efficient implementation of the\nEnergy Strategy for all relevant sectors In the case of EE implementation, AEE\nhas the duty to submit the annual report to the MIE defining the realization of\nthe EE measures in quantities and qualities, level of the realized investments,\nbarriers and reasons behind them, the way of overcoming them, so that energy\nsavings, emission reduction and the remaining targets are achieved AEE is the\nresponsible institution for the Monitoring and Verification of energy savings\nachieved under the NEEAP Dimension Energy Security The targets of the security\nof energy supply have been outlined in country strategic plans and government\ndecisions for their implementation The government policy to increase security of\nenergy supply is based on:       diversification of energy sources and fuels,\nsufficient and decentralised energy production systems, reliable transmission\nand distribution systems and networks, well-functioning of energy markets, clear\nlong-term energy policy that encourages investments, energy efficiency Albania\nhas no nuclear power plant on its territory, nor is it planning to build one\nThere is  National Nuclear Agency whose mission is to put in place  system to\ncalculate energy demand for the next 20- 30 years Albania has two coastal oil\nand gas terminals: Porto Romano in Durres, and Petrolifera in Vlora Each has\ncapacity to store liquid

Decision of Albanian\nGovernment No 417, dated 2017 on the approval of the emergency plan for natural\ngas, in accordance with minimum standards for safety supply and rules for safe\nand effective supply with natural gas The National Emergency Plan for natural\ngas defines the standards related to the minimum requirements suitable for the\nsecurity of natural gas supply in the Republic of Albania, the mandatory\ncriteria for ensuring reliable and efficient supply of natural gas as well as\nthe duties and responsibilities of institutions for managing emergency\nsituations in gas supply to customers The Emergency Plan, specifically includes:\n\uf0b7 Determine standards for minimal requirements for safety supply; \uf0b7 Instruments\nand measures to guarantee an adequate and clearly defined supply of gas for\nprotected customers, in accordance with supply safety standards; Instruments for\nprediction and assessment of potential risks, which clearly set out actions to\nprevent these risks and measures to mitigate possible damages related to them; \uf0b7\n\uf0b7  program to reduce or stop the supply of natural gas to specific categories of\ncustomers in the event of  crisis situation; \uf0b7 The role and responsibilities of\ngas provider companies and non-household consumers, taking into account the\nvarious impact measures in case of  crisis in the natural gas sector; \uf0b7 Criteria\nregarding storage plants, in order to meet supply safety standards, as well as\npossible contributions for storage plants located either in the Republic of\nAlbania or in another contracting party in the Energy Community, or member\ncountry of the Union European; Important measures and actions to be taken to\neliminate or mitigate the impact of  natural gas supply outage, in accordance\nwith different levels of crisis \uf0b7 Assessing the impacts of policies and\nmeasures, Albania is at  moderate stage of preparation on security of supply\nQualitative indicators are displayed below  Gas supply framework The existing\ngas network is outdated and mostly non-operational Its domestic natural gas\nproduction is marginal, of which the majority is consumed for own use in oil\nproduction and by the refining industry On hydrocarbons, Albania has not aligned\nits legislation with the Hydrocarbons Licensing Directive, but there has been\nsome progress with its secondary legislation The Directive on safety of offshore\noil and gas installations has not been transposed In February 2018, the Albanian\ngovernment adopted the \u2018gas master plan\u2019, which assesses investment needs until\nIn May 2018, Albgaz SA, the combined gas operator in Albania, was admitted as an\nobserver at the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas Albgaz\nshould continue with permanent capacity building to be prepared for operation of\nfuture gas infrastructure  Electricity supply framework In the coming years,\nAlbania should in particular pursue the transition process towards\ndiversification away from hydropower and promote alternative sources of\nrenewable energy while complying with environmental standards  Emergency and\ncrisis management system and demand restraint programs Albania\u2019 oil-stock\nlegislation is not in line with the Acquis There was no progress in creating\ncentral stockholding body for oil The country is working in implementation of\nmodel for an emergency oil- stock reserve and for  law on the minimum stocks of\ncrude oil required for security of supply Albania must complete the alignment\nwith the Acquis on minimum oil stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products It\nmust also amend its emergency oil-stock model 27  Energy The national energy\nstrategy  was adopted in The gas master plan was adopted by the government in\nFebruary Further efforts need to be made to adopt the SEA and project\nidentification plan related to the gas master plan Adoption of this SEA and plan\nwill help the development of TEN- projects Progress was made on improving the\ninfrastructure for power transmission The trans-Adriatic pipeline is progressing\non schedule, with % of the project completed by the end of The pipeline is\nexpected to be operational in Major gas interconnector projects are provided for\nunder the gas master plan However, Albania failed to transpose and implement the\nRegulation (EU) 347 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure by\nJanuary 2017, and in November 2018 the Ministerial Council of the Energy\nCommunity adopted  decision establishing  breach of Albania\u2019 obligations under\nthe Energy Community Treaty Dimension Internal Energy Market On the internal\nenergy market, Albania has adopted legislation on gas and electricity in line\nwith the EU\u2019 Third energy package In March 2017, the Albanian Energy Regulator\nEntity (ERE) approved the certification of OST SA as the transmission system\noperator, following  positive opinion from the Energy Community Secretariat The\nENTSO- assembly therefore admitted OST SA as  full member of the network\nProgress has been achieved in the legal unbundling of the distribution-system\noperator OSHEE SA from its supply activity Electricity prices are still\nregulated but should be gradually liberalised On May 2019, the Government of\nAlbania adopted  decision to establish  power exchange, with day-ahead and\nintraday markets The electricity market remains closed by  regulated contract\nbetween state-owned generation and supply companies Power Sector The Power\nSector Law deregulated the prices for electricity generation and wholesale in\nHowever, the wholesale market is not yet fully liberalized The distribution\nsystem operator and supplier OSHEE is still obliged to buy all the electricity\nthat is required to supply customers under universal service and cover losses in\nthe distribution system from the generation company KESH under an exclusive\nmutual contract and regulated conditions, based on the Council of Ministers\u2019\nDecision on public services in the electricity sector This is in breach of the\nEnergy Community Acquis and represents  major obstacle to the development of\ncompetition in the wholesale market in Albania The contract between KESH and\nOSHEE was prolonged in March 2019, however, without the approval of ERE Albania\u2019\nelectricity sector is characterized by  market structure in which most of the\nenergy procurement is dominated by bilateral transactions for large customers,\nwhile most of the other customers and the retail market remains operated under\nregulatory regime Positively, the unbundling of operations and interests is\nunderway, and the one positive aspect in the transmission ownership was adopted\nby law in The Market Rules for operation of the electricity market following the\nMarket Model and including organized day-ahead and intraday functions were\nadopted by ERE in December Also,  law for  market-based procurement of balancing\nwas approved The figure below shows Albania\u2019 electricity market scheme as of\nJuly 28 Figure 11: Albania\u2019 electricity market scheme (Source: Energy Community\nSecretariat) The establishment of  day-ahead market has been delayed The Council\nof Ministers decided on the establishment of APEX, as  separate legal entity\nestablished by the transmission system operator OST with initial capital fully\nfinanced by this company, in May The Decision also provides for the possible\nentry of shareholders other than OST through  competitive procedure and outlines\nthe domain of shareholders and structure of the capital In its related Decision\nof 11 September 2019, the Council defined the detailed procedure for the\nselection of shareholders in APEX and allocated responsibilities to the relevant\nministries and the selection committee The Council defined the bidding and\nselection criteria, procedures, and requirements for each individual category of\npotential bidders from the EU and the Energy Community, including transmission\nsystem operators, international market operators, market participants and\ninternational financial institutions The minister responsible for energy shall\ninitiate the competitive selection procedure however the deadline for its\ninitiation is not defined The Market Rules for operation of the electricity\nmarket following the Market Model and including organized day-ahead and intraday\nfunctions were adopted by ERE in December 2017, their full implementation being\nconditioned by the establishment of APEX The final balancing rules that would\nallow for the full implementation of the requirements of the Law for  market-\nbased procurement of balancing services have not yet been adopted The\ntransitional balancing rules, adopted by ERE in November 2017, are still in\nforce Imbalances are settled using reference hourly prices from the Hungarian\nday-ahead market Although the rules allow new entrants to the balancing market\nand potential balancing service providers are available, KESH is still the sole\nprovider The Law and the Market Model support the possibility for the\ntransmission system operator to exchange balancing services, under market-based\nconditions, across the borders This possibility has not been implemented yet The\nfigure below shows the implementation by electricity indicators as calculated\nand compiled by the Energy Community Secretariat 29 Figure 12: Implementation by\nelectricity indicators (Source: Energy-communityorg Status

operator,  universal service\nsupplier and  free-market supplier and trader, and obtained the necessary\nlicenses by the regulator, ERE The retail market remains only partially\nderegulated, due to the possibility given by the Law to all categories of\ncustomers, except those connected to high voltage, to continue to be supplied by\nthe last resort supplier, OSHEE, at regulated prices for  period of two years\nafter the technical preconditions for switching are in place As  result, most of\nthe customers remain at regulated prices, except for  part of the 35 kV\ncustomers This

supplier within two years from the start of the supply\ncontract from the supplier of last resort At the end of this period, the system\noperator will interrupt the power supply to this customer This amendment (the\nperiod of two years) takes into account the lack of customer experience to\noperate into the liberalized market, and gives to the customers the necessary\ntime to adapt to the transition from the regulated market to the liberalized\nmarket All customers connected to 35 kV should be supplied in the unregulated\nmarket Currently, 98 customers are connected in the 35kV grid, but until now\nonly  limited number of them (28 customers) connected to the 35kV grid, have\nchosen to be supplied in the unregulated market According to the amendments to\nLaw No 43 of 2015 \u201cOn

has\nsucceeded to provide universal access to all its citizens and the country relies\non domestic electricity production which is based primarily in clean hydropower\nenergy The substantial investments in the energy sector over the recent years\nhave improved significantly the quality of electricity supply and attracted the\ninterest of private sector participation, including notable international\ncompanies, to develop electricity production plants The electricity grid\nconstantly expands and upgrades to meet the increased demand and new connections\nSubstantial improvements have been achieved over the recent years in the\ncollection of electricity bills, resulting in an improved performance of the\npublic companies operating the core of the energy sector Despite the\nimprovements and the advantage on relying on clean energy sources, the country\nshould focus further on the affordable aspect of this target as the electricity\nprices are relatively high compared to regional level The Albanian Law on the\nPower Sector (OG 43) defines  vulnerable customer (Article ) as  household\nconsumer who due to social reasons, in special conditions and by definition of\nthis law, is entitled to certain special rights regarding the supply of\nelectricity The vulnerability criteria are, according to Article 95, determined\nby the Ministry of Social Affairs in cooperation with the Ministry for Energy\nand Ministry of Finance together with the state Energy Regulatory Entity\nVulnerability is addressed through different energy and social policies in\naccordance with the Social Strategy in the Energy Community (2013) However,\nEnergy poverty as such is not yet clearly defined and systematically monitored\nThere are no specific policies in place designed to alleviate energy poverty\n\u201cEnergy poverty, in general terms, represents the inability of  household to\nsecure adequate amounts of energy in the home \u2013 allowing it to keep living\nspaces adequately warm and well lit, to have access to  needed range of energy\nservices, and to be able to afford  sufficient amount of energy for everyday\nrequirements\u201d Assessment of policies and measures shows that Albania has adopted\nlegislation on gas and electricity in line with the EU\u2019 third energy package The\nnew national energy strategy  has been adopted There was progress in the gas\nsector and on interconnection lines  Unbundling and third-party access rules\nAlbania has to finalize the unbundling of energy companies and abolish legal\nobstacles to the right of customers to change their electricity supplier In\nMarch 2017, the Albanian Energy Regulator Entity (ERE) approved the\ncertification of OST SA as the transmission system operator, following  positive\nopinion from the Energy Community Secretariat  Energy Poverty in South East\nEurope \u2013 Surviving the Cold South East Europe Sustainable Energy Policy\nprogramme (SEE SEP), 2016 39 The ENTSO- assembly therefore admitted OST SA as\nfull member of the network However, ERE also imposed conditions on OST SA in the\nfinal certification decisions These conditions concerned the transfer of\ninvestment tasks to the new public body owner of the TSO These conditions have\nnot yet been met, and the deadline for meeting them has been postponed for three\nyears Some progress has been achieved in the legal unbundling of the\ndistribution-system operator OSHEE SA from its supply activity This was achieved\nby the establishment of three new companies ERE\u2019 legal framework is to\nprevailing extent in line with the acquis except for  few but central missing\ncompetences, namely the right to impose measures to promote competition, to\nrequire transmission and distribution system operators to change their terms and\nconditions and to raise the penalty level ERE is entitled to impose On the\npractical side ERE should develop into  well-equipped and skilled independent\ninstitution that addresses shortcomings in the national energy markets more\nactively  Harmonization of market rules on  regional level The country has\ndelayed electricity market reforms and should accelerate implementation of the\nconnectivity reform measures, especially by removing legal and contractual\nobstacles to the integration of energy markets The country has to establish an\norganized day-ahead electricity market Electricity prices are still regulated\nbut should be gradually liberalized once legislation is implemented The freedom\nfor all customers to switch suppliers is effectively prevented by amendments to\nthe Power Sector Law; implementation is still lacking since most customers\nconnected to 35kV are allowed to buy supply of last resort, and all connected to\nlower voltage level \u2013 by universal service supplier The electricity market\nremains closed by  regulated contract between state-owned generation and supply\ncompanies This contract must be terminated urgently  Interconnection congestion\nand reliability management Albania is not connected to international gas\nnetworks Albania\u2019 electricity system has been interconnected with the\nneighboring systems of Greece and Montenegro since 2014, when the European\nNetwork of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-) approved synchronous operation\nof the Albanian electricity

the COVID-19 situation\nphysical meetings and workshops have been substituted by virtual meetings and\nworkshops The consultation process is documented and evaluated in order to be\nable to improve the procedure when the next NECP revision is due Figure 17:\nInvolvement of experts through Working Groups and external Stakeholder\nengagement  Involvement of the national parliament MIE after drafting the NECP,\nwill hand on the draft for consultations to institutions which are directly or\nindirectly involved in the process of implementing NECP related project\ninvestments in all NECP dimensions Getting feedbacks, MIE reflects all\nsuggestions provided by different actors to the NECP draft and submits the draft\nincluding the reflections provided to the Albanian Parliament and more\nspecifically to  specific body within the Albanian Parliament where the process\ncontinues with discussions Ministries involved in this process introduce and\ninform the Parliament on expected advantages related with the NECP, namely, to\ntap the full potential of synergies between all NECP dimensions for the benefit\nof the society and the environment They ask for their support, for example to\napprove the EE investment funds Plenary sessions with the Parliament are\norganized, for example on energy and climate issues, in order to increase the\nawareness how to achieve clean air with minimum GHG emissions at the same time\nThis plenary session aims to explain that this is possible by means of  reliable\nNECP (based 45 on NSE and NEEAP),  sufficient investment package ( part provided\nby state budget), implementation of EE measures, naming the responsible\ninstitutions, and an effective monitoring process  Involvement of local and\nregional authorities The local governments are active stakeholders during the\nprocess of drafting and implementing the NECP Local government authorities\nprepare local environmental action plans periodically in conformity with

aligning NECP, National Energy\nStrategy and NDC Existing national plans that have been considered in the\ndevelopment of this document include the National Energy Strategy and the\nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC) The National Energy Strategy has set\ntarget of 42% in TPES and 15% reduction of energy use compared to the baseline\nfor The modelling underlying the strategy differs in GDP growth and population\nThe RE target of the National Energy Strategy uses efficiencies of 78% and less\nfor renewable power generation, which upscales the renewable share in TPES In\nfinal energy, the NECP also achieves  higher RES share On sectoral level, the\nNational Energy Strategy does not consider the strong renovation projected by\nSLED (2015) and adopted by the NECP It uses biomass pellets for space heating,\nwhile the NECP builds on electrification and renovation In Services, the\nNational Energy Strategy projects  strong increase in energy demand In\ntransport, it does not consider electrification, while transmission grid losses\nare underestimated  large difference is seen in the uptake of natural gas, which\nis used to meet 20% of final energy demand in 2030 in the National Energy\nStrategy overall and used in many subsectors, from minor use cases in industry\ntoday Despite these differences, the comparison with the National Energy\nStrategy proved  very useful and insightful reference to the work underlying the\nNECP The NDC of Albania was submitted in 2015 and covered the energy sector only\nIn parallel to the elaboration of the NECP, the revision of the NDC was\nundertaken by  separate team, aiming to also cover the full economy The\nGovernance regulation foresees that the NECP takes precedence over the NDC The\nactivity underlying the elaboration of the NDC was nonetheless carried out in\nparallel, despite several attempts to harmonize and align efforts From the\nmaterial provided by the NDC team, it was possible to improve the scope of PaMs\nunderlying the non-energy sectors, while the estimates of effects have been\nelaborated separately The estimate underlying the LULUCF sector of the NECP have\nbeen taken from the NDC The energy sector estimates of the NDC are reportedly\nbased on the National Energy Strategy, with  limited update to the modelling\nunderlying this document The differences with this document and the underlying\nmodelling have been discussed above Preliminary note on the National Energy\nStrategy The National Energy Strategy (NSE)  is an overall energy sector\nstrategy and was thus the main policy document in the energy sector, serving as\ninput to the Dimensions - of the Energy Union and Albania\u2019 NECP NSE (page 107)\nestimates that the contribution of public investments is equal to 252 MEur for\nthe period , mainly for supporting awareness campaigns and pilot projects to\npromote EE in all economic sectors Private investment and donor financing are\nestimated with ,399 MEur for the period 2018-With regard to the Dimensions\nDecarbonisation and Energy Efficiency, the targets of the NSE have been adjusted\nbased on the evolving knowledge base 13Approved by DCM No 480, dated 2018

accordance with\nArticle 2a of Directive 2010/EU; Based on Article  of Directive 2012/EU on\nenergy efficiency in building renovation, Albania has not yet completed the\nstrategy for supporting and encouraging cost effective investments in the\nrenovation of the national building stock It is the objective to develop the\nstrategy for mobilizing investments in the renovation of buildings in line with\nthe requirements of article 2a Directive 2010/EU on the Longterm renovation\nstrategy Referring to the law on Energy Performance of Buildings (transposing\nDirective 2010/EU) it is planned to establish  national plan to increase the\nnumber of buildings with \"nearly zero energy performance\", increasing the energy\nperformance of private and public buildings () the total floor area to be\nrenovated or equivalent annual energy savings to be achieved from 2021 to 2030\nunder Article  of Directive 2012/EU on the exemplary role of public bodies'\nbuildings; The 2nd-3rd NEEAP defines  target for the renovation rate and\nmeasures to improve energy efficiency for public buildings: By 2020 the annual\nprediction is as follows: \uf0b7 Renovation of the stock of public buildings by %\neach year, heated/cooled area for buildings under administration or use by\npublic authorities/institution due to meet the minimum energy performance\nrequirements By 2022 the following measures are expected: \uf0b7 high efficiency\nthermic isolation in buildings \uf0b7 soft loans and other financial stimuli for new\nconstructions should be developed, as well The data available about the public\nbuilding stock is not sufficient and needs to be addressed Information needs to\nbe available in much more in detail to be able to determine the total floor area\nto be renovated and the energy efficiency level which must be achieved In\ngeneral, main challenges to be addressed are: \uf0b7 AEE has to fill the number of\nthe staff, employees in order to manage all issues related to the EE, NEEAP and\nimplementation of EPB/EE laws; \uf0b7 Primary and secondary legislation on Energy\nPerformance of Buildings to be put in place; \uf0b7 Budgeting questionnaires; \uf0b7\nEnergy auditors

elements set out in point () of Article  The\nobjective of energy security is to ensure  lasting, secure and quality supply of\nall energy-generating and supply systems Security means that the energy has to\nbe available, accessible, affordable and acceptable in proportion with the\ndevelopment of the country To achieve this objective, the Albanian Government\nhas approved the National Strategy of Energy 2018\u20132030 as an overall energy\nsector strategy National security objectives defined by the National Energy\nStrategy and relevant in the context of the NECP connecting with energy security\nare: \uf0b7 Increasing and further development of national primary energy sources in\nsustainable and competitive way In order to achieve this objective, it is\nnecessary to introduce integral and systematic planning of supply of all energy-\ngenerating products and forms of energy \uf0b7 Development of diverse supply sources\nthrough new investments, increasing regional cooperation and integration and\ninterconnection with regional and European electricity and natural gas networks\nin accordance with the Acquis of the Energy Community Treaty \uf0b7 Enhancing\nsecurity of energy transmission and supply through diversification of supply\nroutes of energy and improving the security and the reliability of them through\ncost-effectiveness 15 The typology of the residential building stock in Albania\nand the modelling of its low-carbon transformation (2017) Support for low-\nemission development (SLED) in South East Europe (SEE) 54 \uf0b7 investments Increase\nthe security of energy supply with affordable costs for Albanian citizens and\nthe economy Integration of the Albanian electricity and natural gas market with\nKosovo, the region and European markets Couple the electricity market in line\nwith the commitments made under the so-called Berlin process \uf0b7 The security of\nenergy supply shall be based on well-functioning energy competitive markets that\noffers the right signals for the production and consumption of electricity and\ngas and  clear long-term energy policy that encourages investments Increasing\ngas, oil and energy storage capacity in the energy system in accordance with\nDirective 2009/EC of 14 September 2009 imposing an obligation to maintain\nminimum stocks of products \uf0b7 \uf0b7 The achievement of country objectives for\nrenewable energy sources, energy efficiency, reduction of energy intensity of\nGDP and development of cost-effective policies and strategies to increase energy\nperformance in public and residential buildings is expected to have  stabilizing\neffect on security of supply \uf0b7 Development of  policy framework for energy\n(including energy efficiency for sustainable transport) in transport based on\nthe Albania Sector Transport Strategy, and the introduction of new technologies\nin all its sectors is also expected to have  stabilizing effect on security of\nsupply by reducing the amount of oil and petrol imports \uf0b7 The road transport\nshall be shifted to other transport modalities, like the rail or water transport\nThe fulfilment of this objective will contribute to reduce fuel consumption \uf0b7\nRenovation of oil and petroleum industry and supply infrastructure, quality\ncontrol systems and the introduction of new technologies to the oil sector \uf0b7\nPlanning the exploration of country oil reserves and creation of  national\nsecurity/reserve stock The Master Plan of Natural Gas for Albania was approved\nby DCM No 87 of This plan aims to develop  sustainable natural gas system that\nenables  balanced contribution to the energy system, ensuring gas supply through\ncompetition and environmental protection  completely new gas transmission and\ndistribution system is needed It identifies the following gas objectives and\nprojects which are relevant in the context of the NECP: The Gas Master Plan\ndefines the main lines for the development of the gas market and services in\nAlbania based on natural gas supplied through the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP\nProject), as well as potential gas sources discovered and concretized in the\ncountry, or even through natural gas pipelines such as the Ionian Adriatic\nPipeline (IAP Project) and the Albania - Kosovo Pipeline (ALKOGAP Project)\nAlbania intends to develop an underground natural gas storage site in Dumre,\nnear Elbasan (UGS Dumrea Project) The construction of the pipeline that will\nlink the TAP project near the Fier Compressor Station area to the Vlora TPP and\nthe entire Vlora region, will make it possible to restore the Vlora TPP by using\nnatural gas as fuel In 2040, the potential consumption of natural gas for\nelectricity generation could be around 770 million m\u00b3, while the projected\nconsumption at the country' refineries could be around million m\u00b3 Vision,\nstrategic objectives and projects of the Albanian Government for the development\nof the gas sector by 2040: \uf0b7 Creating  favorable investment climate for\ninvestments in national gas transmission and distribution system and integration\ninto the regional and international networks TAP project presents an opportunity\nto introduce in  larger scale the consumption of natural gas for 55 households\nby creating  gas market and increment of new investments in gas infrastructure\nPriority shall be the implementation of \"Feasibility Study\" and detailed design\nand then construction of the national gas transmission network, including\nstrategic axes and connection to regional gas networks; \uf0b7 Harmonization of\nnational legislation such as tariff systems, network codes, supply rules, and\nmarket code in accordance with the Acquis Communitaire; \uf0b7 Creation and\nfunctioning of the gas market in accordance with EU standards, as defined in the\n\uf0b7 Third EU Energy Package; Improving the maintenance and performance of the\nexisting gas transmission and distribution network with the involvement of state\nsector company (ALBGAZ sh) and specialized private companies, through  system of\nmanagement of existing assets and those that will be created during the\nimplementation of the Master Plan Priority: Revitalization of the existing\nnatural gas transmission and distribution network, currently administered by\nstate sector company ALBGAZ sh, which operates as  combined operator; \uf0b7\nPriority: Preventive measures and action plan to improve security and mitigate\npotential risks in the existing network and in what will be built, using and\nimplementing technical standards and codes for the gas sector, which are in line\nwith the relevant standards and codes of EU countries  National objectives with\nregard to diversification and resilience The national energy strategy foresees\nthe stimulation of appropriate diversification of energy production through new\ninvestments, increasing of regional cooperation and integration and\ninterconnection with regional and European electricity and natural gas networks\nin accordance with the Acquis of the Energy Community Treaty In the power\nsector, Albania is almost entirely dependent on hydropower Increasing the share\nof RES other than hydropower in the structure of used energy-generating products\nwill contribute to reduce dependence on water resources The integration of the\nAlbanian electricity market with Kosovoalso shall increase the diversification\nof electricity sources and supply, as Albania has almost 100% hydro capacity\n(sensitive to changing hydrological conditions) and Kosovo has almost 100%\nthermal capacity The coupling of the two systems, combining the generating would\nimprove the security of supply through more efficient use of the capacities of\nexisting interconnection lines and tariff signals The construction of the TAP\ngas pipeline and the related objective of creating  regional gas market is\nexpected to contribute to the diversification of energy sources Supply with gas\nof the existing thermo power station in Vlora shall contribute to increasing\nenergy diversity Biofuel targets of 10% as share of biofuels versus total fuel\nconsumption in the transport sector in 2030 is expected also to have an effect\nin diversification of energy sources in the transport sector  National\nobjectives with regard to reducing energy import dependency The main objectives\nare as follows: \uf0b7 \uf0b7 to reduce import dependency regarding electricity to reduce\nimport dependency regarding oil products Power sector: Expansion of new\ngeneration capacity in the future: some new large HPP as Devolli River Cascade,\nFan River Cascade, some small power plants which are under construction,\nPhotovoltaics, etc also shall contribute in reducing energy import dependency\nGas sector: 56 Creation and functioning of the gas market and creating\nfavorable investment climate for investments in national gas transmission and\ndistribution system and integration into the regional and international networks\nshall contribute on reducing energy import dependency and increasing the\nflexibility of the national energy systems Supply with gas of the existing\nthermo power station in Vlora and the planned TPP in Kor\u00e7a shall contribute to\nthe reduction of energy import quantity and increase energy diversity Oil\nsector: Albania has become highly dependent of imported oil products due to\ndeclining of oil production in combination with  sharply growing demand for\ngasoline, diesel and heavy fuel oil The transport sector was the greatest energy\nconsumer, with about 40% of the final total consumption (2013) Unless the fact\nthat Albania is rated as one of Europe\u2019 richest countries in onshore hydrocarbon\nreserves, very little has been done for increasing productivity and\ntechnological improvements which was therefore integrated in the NECP The\nobjective to shift the existing road transport to other transport modalities,\nlike the rail or water transport will contribute to reduce fuel consumption The\ngoal for the share of the bio-fuels vs total fuel consumption in transport\nsector 10% in 2020, 10% in 2025 and 10% in 2030 as compared to 55% in 2015 will\nalso contribute to reduce fossil fuel consumption in transport  National\nobjectives with regard to increasing flexibility The national targets for 2030\nabout increasing the contribution of primary energy sources, increasing of\nrenewable energy production, increasing of natural gas penetration, development\nof diverse supply sources through new investments, increasing regional\ncooperation and integration and interconnection with regional and European\nelectricity and natural gas networks, integration of the Albanian electricity\nand natural gas market with Kosovo, enhancing security of energy transmission\nand supply through diversification of supply routes of energy and improving the\nsecurity and the reliability of them through cost-effectiveness investments\nshall increase the flexibility of the national energy system The Master Plan of\nNatural Gas for Albania was approved by DCM No 87 of 2018 and aims to develop\nsustainable natural gas system that enables  balanced contribution to the energy\nsystem, ensuring gas supply through competition and environmental protection\ncompletely new gas transmission and distribution system is needed In 2040, the\npotential consumption of natural gas for electricity generation could be around\n770 million m\u00b3, while the projected consumption at the country' refineries could\nbe around million m\u00b3 Priority projects identified in the Master Plan of Gas for\nAlbania are described in chapter  of the NECP draft document Expansion of new\ngeneration capacity is planned in the future: some new large HPP as Devolli\nRiver Cascade, Fan River Cascade, some small power plants which are under\nconstruction, two new thermo power stations in Kor\u00e7a, Ku\u00e7ova, etc also shall\ncontribute to increasing the flexibility of the national energy system\nDimension Internal energy market The objective of internal energy market is to\nharmonize and liberalize the country\u2019 internal energy market, to address market\naccess, transparency and regulation, consumer protection, supporting\ninterconnection, and adequate levels of supply 57 The goal is to build  more\ncompetitive, customer-centered, flexible and non-discriminatory electricity\nmarket with market-based supply prices In so doing, they strengthen and expand\nthe rights of individual customers and energy communities, address energy\npoverty, clarify the roles and responsibilities of market participants and\nregulators and address the security of the supply of electricity, gas and oil,\nas well as the development of regional and European networks for transporting\nelectricity and gas To achieve this goal, the Albanian Government has approved\nThe National Strategy of Energy 2018\u2013 2030 as an overall energy sector strategy\nin which objectives connected with the dimension of the Internal energy market\nare: - Opening of the electricity market 100% in 2025 - Cash collection from\nelectricity selling 92% in 2020, 95% in 2025 and 98% in 2030 as compared to 90%\nin 2018 - Development of diverse supply sources increasing regional cooperation\nand integration and interconnection with regional and European electricity and\nnatural gas networks in accordance with the Acquis of the Energy Community\nTreaty - Integration of the Albanian electricity and natural gas market with\nKosovo, the region and European markets Couple the electricity market in line\nwith the commitments made under the so-called Berlin process - Well-functioning\nenergy competitive markets that offer the right signals for the production and\nconsumption of electricity and gas - Increasing gas, oil and energy storage\ncapacity in the energy system in accordance with Directive 2009/EC of 14\nSeptember 2009 imposing an obligation to maintain minimum stocks of products -\nDevelopment of plans for the creation of the Albanian gas market and its\nregional integration, as well as for the sale, transmission, distribution and\nretail sale of natural gas by TAP and other gas sources Implementation of market\nreforms necessary to comply with the Acquis of the Energy Community; -\nConsolidation and further strengthening of ALBGAZ , on the role of the combined\ngas transmission and distribution operator; Natural gas objectives connecting\nwith Internal energy market as defined in Master Plan of Albania' natural gas\nsector for the period  are: \uf0b7 Harmonization of national legislation such as\ntariff systems, network codes, supply rules, and market code in accordance with\nthe Acquis Communitaire \uf0b7 Creation and functioning of the gas market in\naccordance with EU standards, as defined in the Third EU Energy Package; \uf0b7\nBuilding  database about transmission and distribution networks, as well as the\nunderground gas storage or GNL terminals of the market operators, which will\nenable comprehensive monitoring of all gas sector activities  Electricity\ninterconnectivity Integration into the regional and EU energy markets is\nstrategic objective of the Albanian Government to meet its growing demand for\nenergy, diversity of energy sources, efficiency and flexibility of the national\nenergy system To achieve this objective, Albania has to invest in electrical\nenergy interconnectivity infrastructure Albania has interconnectivity\ninfrastructure with Kosovo, Montenegro and Greece through six Interconnection\nlines: \uf0b7 400 kV line Zemblak - Kardia (Greece) \uf0b7 400 kV line Tirana  - Podgorica\n(Montenegro) \uf0b7 400 kV line Tirana2 - Kosovo  (Kosovo) 58 \uf0b7 220 kV line Koplik -\nPodgorica (Montenegro) \uf0b7 220 kV line Fierz\u00eb - Prishtina (Kosovo) \uf0b7 150 kV\nBistrica  - Igumenica (Greece) The analysis in chapter  shows that Albania'\nwater-based electricity system is exposed to shortages in dry years This means\nthat an increment of exchange capacity with the neighbor systems is expected in\nthe near future and the need for investment in strengthening and development of\nthe interconnection network is evident The development of new projects will be\nbased on technical and economic considerations and based on cost-benefit\nanalysis in accordance with the ENTSO- methodology The strengthening and\ndevelopment of the interconnection network will create more favorable technical\nconditions to develop an integrated market of electricity in the region and help\nthe country\u2019 energy sector to continue its transformation towards  more\ncompetitive marketplace, while aligning with the Third Energy Package initiative\nand objectives As part of the Third Energy Package emphasis, cross- border\nmarket integration is  crucial step towards  pan-European regional energy market\nIn the National Strategy of Energy 2018\u20132030, it is foreseen:

system and GHG emission developments\nMacroeconomic forecasts (GDP and population growth)  The macroeconomic drivers\nunderlying this analysis are based on the most up-to-date available projections\nGDP projection is based on calculations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF\n2021) This includes impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic development\nstarting in 2020 with  decrease of % in GDP The recovery starts in 2021 with %\nof GDP growth, which then gradually decreases to %  in 2025 maintaining the same\nannual growth until Figure 18 shows the real GDP development (monetary value of\n2015) The population development is aligned with the official data of the\nAlbanian statistics office INSTAT in the medium scenario (Statistical Database\n2021) Population will decrease slightly from 87 Million in 2018 to 76 Million in\n2030 and 60 Million in Figure 19 shows the population development Figure 18:\nReal GDP development 2012 - 2040 119 Figure 19: Population development  Sectoral\nchanges expected to impact the energy system and GHG emissions ii Apart from GDP\nand Population, the distribution of value added among energy demand sectors\nplays an important role in energy consumption Figure 20 shows the share of the\nindustrial, services and agricultural sector between 1995 and The value added\nshares between sectors are assumed to continue existing trends The growth\ndynamic of the services sector is expected to continue increasing its relative\nvalue added share Figure 20: Value added share of energy demand sectors\nexplicitly analysed in the model from 1995 to 2018 120 Apart from macroeconomic\nimpacts, different structural changes affect energy consumption on sectoral\nlevel The most important effects are presented subsequently ordered by sector\nResidential sector The household size is decreasing from on average  persons per\nhousehold in 2012 to  persons per household in 2030 and then decreasing further\nto  in 2040 (Statistical Database 2021) The floor area per person is considered\nto increase from 4m\u00b2 in 2012 to m\u00b2 in 2018 and m\u00b3 in It further increases to 2m\u00b2\nin Overall, total floor area increases from Million m\u00b2 in 2012 to 145 Million m\u00b2\nin 2030 and further to 154 Million m\u00b2 in 2040 despite the decrease in population\nFigure 21 shows the development of building age classes based on SLED (2015),\nwhich is assumed as projection here The reconstruction rate is high, leading to\nshare of 37% of floor area by 2040 that is built or refurbished after The\nstrongest deconstruction is seen in buildings built between 1961 and Figure 21:\nFloor area development by year of construction Source: SLED 2015, own\nrepresentation Notable as well is the change in distribution of floor area over\ndifferent building types Table 12 defines these building classes 121 Building\ntype Number of dwellings per building Detached houses Semidetached houses Row\nhouses Apartment buildings    to  > Table 12: Definition of building types With\nthe share of detached houses in terms of floor area remaining relatively\nconstant (decreasing from % in 2012 to % in 2040), semidetached houses and row\nhouses see the highest change in share, dropping from % to % and % to %,\nrespectively The strongest increase is seen in apartment buildings, rising from\n% in 2012 to % in The impact of the change in housing composition decreases\nenergy intensity due to lower energy consumption per floor area in apartment\nbuildings than in smaller building types Figure 22 shows the development of\nfloor area by building type Furthermore, newer and larger buildings tend to use\nlower share of fuel wood for space heating and water heating, giving way for\nelectric heating and increasingly heat pumps  rebound effect depending on\nbuilding type for higher usage of space heating due to the improved energy\nperformance is expected Equally, the prevalence of space cooling devices in\nhouseholds is expected to increase strongly from 45% in 2012 in Zones  and  to\n71% in Zone  and 74% in Zone  in In Zone , the prevalence is expected to\nincrease from 15% in 2012 to 37% in This leads to an increase in energy\nconsumption for space cooling that is not offset by the improved energy\nperformance The reconstruction rate of buildings therefore has the largest share\nin decreasing energy intensity and  changing fuel split in the residential\nsector Wood usage in space heating decreases from % in 2012 to % in 2040 when\nnot accounting for any policies and measures In the same timeframe the use of\nelectricity rises from % to % The rest is covered by LPG Energy Intensity for\nspace heating and space cooling is determined by heating degree days (HDD) and\ncooling degree days (CDD) Values are taken for three climate zones Zone  being\nthe coastal region with the warmest climate, Zone  the central area including\nthe capital Tirana with intermediate climate and Zone  being the mountainous\neast of the country with the coolest climate Degree Days Zone  HDD (\u00b0) CDD (\u00b0)\n1330 870 Zone  1534 760 Zone  2600 350 Table 13: Heating and Cooling degree

services sector, the most important driver is the strong\ngrowth performance in value added as was shown in the sectoral development of\nthe economy in Figure In 2040, the sector reaches  value added of  times that of\nthe 2012-base value (in constant Euros) The strongest growth performance\noriginates from the accommodation and food subsector, increasing -fold between\n2012 and Figure 23: Value added of subsectors to the Services sector, normalized\nto the year 2012 123 Industry In industry, the energy demand is determined by\nproduction volumes, which in turn are projected to increase with GDP growth The\nvalue-added split between subsectors is projected to remain constant The most\nimportant sector in terms of energy demand is the Minerals sector, which is\ndominated by cement production There is also some production of ferro-chromium\nin the country and limited production of recycled aluminium and lead Processing\nof food, drink and tobacco plays only  minor role in terms of energy consumption\nThe demand for energy increases in all sectors with production volumes, which\ngrow according to GDP growth projections This is in part compensated by an\nefficiency gain of %  Transport The main driver of the transport sector is the\ndemand for mobility, seen in  rising annual demand for person km, as given in\nFigure This variable has seen  strong growth in the past and is projected to\ncontinue to grow with historic growth rate Transport of freight is projected to\nundergo growth with GDP In addition to total demand for transport, the share\nbetween transport modes is an important factor to consider, see Figure 25 for\nnumbers on passenger transport The largest share of passenger transport happens\nby passenger cars, with motorcycles and navigation taking small shares Shared\nand public transport is an important factor Rail transport is negligible, so\ntransport by busses is the only shared road transport mode This has seen\ndecrease from % in 2015 to just below 11% in This share is projected to recover\nto % by 2030 and remain stable after This still corresponds to an increase in\ntotal bus km even after 2030 due to the overall increase in transport Another\nimportant factor to regulate energy demand in passenger transport is the load of\nvehicles, but this is not projected to change with existing measures Freight\ntransport is delivered by trucks and to  small share by rail and through\nnavigation Freight transport is projected to increase with GDP The shares\nbetween these modes do not see  change until Figure 24: Annual demand for\npassenger transport in Albania, giving historic values and the future growth 124\nFigure 25: Shares of transport modes in passenger transport in Albania projected\nwith existing measures until the year 2040 The energy demand in the transport\nsector is also determined by the technology used for propulsion and respective\nfuels As has been discussed above, passenger transport and notably by car is the\nmain driver of energy demand Figure 26 shows how novel technologies are\nprojected to penetrate the vehicle stock of passenger cars in Albania  notable\nincrease of gasoline-gas hybrid vehicles is projected to continue As the vehicle\nmarket is dominated by used cars and the average age of cars is around 14 years,\nthe penetration with novel technologies like electric vehicles is not completed\nby 125 Figure 26: Technology shares in passenger transport by cars as given for\nhistoric vehicle statistics in 2016 to 2018 and as projected under consideration\nof existing measures

Technology shares in passenger\ntransport as given for historic vehicle statistics in 2016 to 2018 and as\nprojected under consideration of existing measures until the year 2040 Other\nenergy demand Other energy demand sectors are distinguished as in the energy\nbalance of Albania, splitting along the agriculture and fisheries sectors Energy\ndemand in the agricultural sector is driven by the production volume, which has\nbeen increasing over the past years and is seen to continue to increase (39%\nincrease in 2030, 83% increase in 2040, relative to 2018) Fisheries production\nis driven by GDP growth (40% increase in 2030, 95% increase in 2040, relative to\n2018) The efficiency gain is projected at %  for fisheries and agriculture Non-\nenergy use of energy carriers is associated with production in the chemical\nsector (growing with GDP, less than % of non-energy demand) and with the total\ndemand for transport Energy transformation The energy transformation sector\nincludes oil extraction, refinery, electricity production and transmission and\ndistribution Albania had proven oil reserves of about 220 Million Barrels in It\nis extracted in one main site and refined by two aged refineries Due to the\nlimited refining capacity,  large part of the crude oil is exported and oil\nproducts are imported Electricity production is almost exclusively based on\nhydropower and is therefore renewable Aspects of energy security play an\nincreasing role with changing climate conditions and diminishing rainfall Dry\nyears with low hydroelectric output can currently not be compensated by other\nproduction technologies Possible solutions are an increased electricity\ninterconnection with neighbouring countries, combined with the expansion of\nother renewable sources like solar power or wind energy that are subject to\ndifferent temporal variations than hydropower Solar PV sees an increase in power\ngeneration with existing measures Further, considerations are made to refurbish\nthe Vlora thermal power plant to be fuelled with natural gas The Transadriatic\nPipeline (TAP) recently entered into operation in late 2020 and brings gas from\nAzerbaijan Gas has  very flexible character in energy generation but will\nincrease the GHG emissions of the electricity production sector Relying on\nimported gas does not necessarily improve the situation of energy security 127\nFinally, while transmission networks are rather solid and do not incur very high\nlosses, distribution networks incur high losses of almost 20% These losses are\nprojected to be reduced by existing measures in the coming years Industrial\nprocesses and product use The largest share of IPPU emissions (% of total\nemissions in 2018 in terms of CO2eq) stem from cement production (% of IPPU\nemissions) and these will continue to rise as cement production continues to\ngrow This growth is projected to continue with GDP growth, which is broadly in\nline with the reconstruction in the residential sector and the demand in other\nsectors The production of ferro- chromium (growing with GDP) also leads to\nsmall share of emissions (% of IPPU emissions), as do the production of steel\n(%) and lime (%) The emission trends of refrigerating agents used in place of\nozone depleting substances are projected to continue to rise until the year 2024\nwith historic trends (HFC 134a reaching 60 tonnes , HFC 227ea reaching 15 tonnes\nas the by far dominant substances) After 2024, emissions of these substances see\nno further increase in line with the Kigali amendment of the Montreal protocol\nAgriculture The development of non-energy emissions in the agricultural sector\n(% of total emissions) is determined by the livestock population and\nagricultural practices The population of all livestock species has been\nrelatively constant over the past years, except for poultry and pigs The number\nof the respective species is therefore seen to continue in this increasing trend\nManure management practices are not projected to change Figure 27: Livestock\nhistorically and until the year 2050 In addition to livestock, agricultural\nemissions stem from field management practices The share of organic farming is\nprojected to increase to 10% in 2030, from % in 2018, but  further increase is\nnot projected to happen after The practice of residue burning is projected to\nstop by The application of urea will be cut in half by 2030, with no further\ndecline afterwards 128 LULUCF Currently, the LULUCF sector is  source of\nemissions (% of total emissions), as the natural sink capacity cannot compensate\nfor emissions from forest management This is not projected to change with\nexisting measures Forest fires are another source of emissions, which can become\ndominant factor in the overall GHG balance Improved forest management can also\nhelp to reduce the impact and spread of forest fires, however, an increase to\nmedian fire area (8kha) is still projected (increase of 50% until 2050), with no\nlarge fire episodes considered Waste Emissions from the waste sector (% of total\nemissions, considering solid waste and waste water treatment) are projected to\ncontinue to increase The emissions of solid waste management are driven by the\noverall generation of waste per capita, which is projected to increase from 584\nkg/cap in 2018 with an annual growth rate of % to close to 700 kg/cap in 2030\nand 811 kg/cap in Waste management then determines the amount of emissions\ngenerated Currently, solid waste remains largely unmanaged, disposed of in open,\nunmanaged dumpsites By determined policies already adopted by way of the\nIntegrated Waste Management Strategy, this practice is overturned until the year\nFull management of solid waste disposal is achieved by In addition, the share of\nwaste going to landfills is reduced to 45% in 2030 and 24% in 2035 (from 81% in\n2018), with an increasing share of recycling (increased from 14% in 2018 to 38%\nin 2030 and 46% in 2035) and an increase in combustion in waste incineration\nplants with energy recovery (% in 2018, % in 2025, 17% in 2030 and 30% in 2035)\nThere is currently  small share of uncontrolled incineration (% in 2018); the\npractice is projected to be reduced in the coming years and ultimately stopped\nin Wastewater is currently mainly untreated in Albania, but an

the\nWorld Bank (World Bank ESMAP 2009), output from reservoir hydroelectric plants\nis expected to decrease by 15% until Run-of-river hydroelectric plants are\nexpected to see  20% drop in output Photovoltaics output is expected to increase\nby % until To study the effect of years with low hydro availability, the\nmodelling exercise underlying this document considers years with reduced hydro\navailability every five years (starting in 2022) In these years, the\navailability of hydro power plants is considered to be only 60% that of other\nyears The effects of this exercise are visible in some of the figures shown in\nthe following chapters 132 Figure 28: Oil Price (USD/bbl) Historical data Brent\nSource: Enerdata Projection data world average Source: World Bank 2021

GHG\nemissions and removals  Trends in current GHG emissions and removals in the EU\nETS, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors and different energy sectors Long time\ntrends in GHG emissions are difficult to assess for Albania, due to limited\nstatistics available, particularly in the non-energy sectors Several in part\ncontrasting data sources have been assessed and compiled to best of knowledge,\nmostly building on Statistical Database 2021 (2021), complemented by data\nprovided by local experts, the Biennial Update Report (Ministria  Turizmit dhe\nMjedisit 2021) The detailed documentation of the model can be made available The\nenergy balance by subsector is only available since For these reasons, historic\ntrends are only shown here starting from the year Current trends are given until\nand including the year The modelling activity underlying this document starts\nthe projection in For  better overview of historic developments and future\nprojections considering existing measures, figures and tables are given here\nonly once, in the following section ii Projections of sectoral developments with\nexisting national and Union policies and measures at least until 2040 (including\nfor the year 2030) Considering the measures classified as WEM in Chapter  and\nsummarized in Table 15, the following figures and tables show GHG emissions for\ndifferent sectors Where appropriate, the emissions are broken down to\nsubsectors, showing an increasing level of sectoral detail For better\nreadability, these figures show values for historic trends from the year 2016 to\n2018, followed by projections for the years up to Table 17 lists the historic\nvalues shown in the figures as well as projections for 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035\nand 134 The overall trend in emissions is increasing (Figure 30), with limited\nemissions coming from the transformation sector In dry years (every five years\non two and seven), the emissions increase as the use of the thermal power plant\nincreases Figure 31 shows the direct emissions from energy demand sectors Main\ndriver is the transport sector, followed by industry Note that these industry\nemissions are only the energy related emissions Figure 30: GHG emissions (CO2eq)\nfor the whole economy for the historic years  and as projected for 2019- to 2040\n135 Figure 31: Direct GHG emissions (CO2eq) for energy demand sectors for the\nhistoric years  and as projected for  The following figures (Figure 32 to Figure\n36) show the emissions from the different subsectors In residential sector,\nchange in the housing structure and technology switch in heating and hot water\nleads to  modest reduction of emissions In the services sector, the total\nemissions are relatively constant, changes happening in subsectors As the energy\ndemand in industry (driven by an increase in production) sees an increase with\nGDP, the emissions rise dramatically, with the Minerals sector,  cement\nproduction, remaining by far the largest source of emissions Note that this\nsubsector is particularly hard to decarbonise and sees little electrification,\ndifferent to other subsectors such as the production of ferro- alloys which\nhappens in electric arc furnaces without local energy related emissions\nEmissions from the transport sector continue to rise, as the electrification of\nroad transport cannot offset the growth in demand for mobility 136 Figure 32:\nDirect GHG emissions (CO2eq) for the residential sector for the historic years\nand as projected for  Figure 33: Direct GHG emissions (CO2eq) for the services\nsector for the historic years  and as projected for  137 Figure 34: Direct GHG\nemissions (CO2eq) for industry (energy demand) for the historic years  and as\nprojected for  Figure 35: Direct GHG emissions (CO2eq) for the transport sector\nfor the historic years  and as projected for  Emissions from the transformation\nsector are partially determined by emissions from electricity production in the\nthermal power plant Vlora, which sees  repowering with natural gas However, with\nthe existing hydro power plants and respective plans, the use of this power\nplant is limited to dry years 138 with limited hydro availability Only in the\nsecond half of the 2030' does electricity demand rise to such levels that the\npower plant is used every year In addition to power generation, the emissions\nfrom the transformation sector are determined by the oil extraction and refinery\nactivity, which is relatively constant in the WEM scenario except for  slight\nincrease in Figure 36: Direct GHG emissions (CO2eq) for the transformation\nsector for the historic years  and as projected for  The following Figure 37\nshows non-energy emissions While agriculture emissions remain constant, the\nLULUCF sector remains  source of emissions Waste sector emissions decline after\n2025 while IPPU emissions continue to rise even after These sectors are\ndiscussed in more detail in the following 139 Figure 37: Non-energy related GHG\nemissions (CO2eq) for the historic years  and as projected for 2019- 2040 From\nFigure 38, it is clear that the cement production is also the main driver of\nIPPU emissions, as for the energy related emissions Of note: While the other\nindustrial sectors play only  minor role, it is necessary to regulate emissions\nof refrigerants used in place of ozone depleting substances, the second largest\nsource of emissions in the IPPU sector Main share of agriculture emissions\n(Figure 39) is taken by enteric fermentation, which is not projected to change\nas livestock numbers stay close to constant  small reduction in the sector is\nachieved by  reduction of urea application LULUCF emissions (Figure 40) are\nprojected to remain net positive The natural sink capacity of the forest cannot\noutweigh the emissions due to forest management Large episodes of forest fires\nare not considered in the model, but the median area affected by forest fires is\nprojected to increase Waste sector emissions (Figure 41) see  decline due to\nchange in management practices of solid waste disposal, changing recycling\nshares and disposal site management This does not lead to  complete drop in\nemissions, as existing waste disposal sites continue to emit Emission reductions\nare also achieved by  change in wastewater management practices, essentially\nmoving away from direct river discharge to well managed sites without methane\nemissions 140 Figure 38: GHG emissions (CO2eq) from industrial processes and\nproduct use for the historic

in\nthe residential sector as the sector with the largest demand in renewable energy\nother than electricity The final energy demand decreases over time as  strong\nrenovation scheme is taking place, explained in section ii The renovation and\nreconstruction lead to an decrease in the final energy intensity for heating In\naddition, it is assumed that heat pumps replace electricity for heating if deep\nrenovation takes place, where deep renovation is understood as  replacing\nwindows in line with SLED (2015) The energy contained in the ambient heat is not\nexplicitly reflected in the projection, only the electricity used to run the\nheat pump This determines the final energy intensity of space heating, which\nconsequently sees  strong reduction 151 Figure 46: Final energy and

Energy Efficiency  Current primary and final energy\nconsumption in the economy and per sector (including industry, residential,\nservice and transport) The current final energy consumption of Albania (2018) is\nat ktoe, with primary energy consumption at ktoe The difference is determined by\ntransmission losses and the refining of crude oil to refinery products\nCurrently,  large share of crude oil is exported and not processed in local\nrefineries As mentioned above,  detailed energy balance on subsector level of\nindustrial demand is only available since the year Historic values for the year\n2016 to 2018 are shown below in combination with projections considering\nexisting policies and measures ii Current potential for the application of high-\nefficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling The power\nsupply of Albania is currently based exclusively on hydropower, with solar power\nplants projected with existing measures until the year There is no fossil-\nfuelled power plant in operation and no electricity generation from biomass\nCogeneration of heat and electricity is therefore not  possible option There are\ncurrently no district heating networks in operation or planned The potential for\nsuch networks would exist in larger agglomerations There is limited industry,\nwhich could provide  source for district heating (cement, iron and steel, ferro-\nalloy production) There is  general potential for district heating, as the use\nof fuel wood for heating is high in older buildings, which are undergoing\nstrong reconstruction scheme Corresponding projects are currently not planned or\nprojected to be realized 152 iii Projections considering existing energy\nefficiency policies, measures and programmes as described in point  (ii) for\nprimary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040\n(including for the year 2030) Net primary energy supply in Albania is currently\n(2018 value) at ktoe and is projected to increase to ktoe by 2030 and ktoe by\nFigure 47 shows primary energy supply for Albania as projected with existing\nmeasures up to the year The figure shows net values of each fuel category As\nthese values are for primary energy, electricity is only displayed when it is\nnot produced in the country from primary energy sources (mostly hydro), but\nimported (mostly in years in which the hydro availability has been deliberately\nreduced to study the effect on the energy system) The total demand for primary\nenergy increases, in particular driven by the demand for transport fuels The\nincreasing demand for electricity is met by an increasing supply with hydro\npower Table 25 gives the values for each fuel considered Note that negative\nvalues stand for an export of the

Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency including\nrelevant risks  The current electricity mix of Albania consists almost\nexclusively of hydropower At  currently still very low but rising level, solar\npower is entering the mix Fossil energy sources, however, are entirely absent\nfrom the Albanian electricity generation sector Although  project for an oil\npowered thermal power plant in Vlora with 97 MW capacity was completed in 2011,\nit never entered into operation  revitalisation of the plant after refurbishment\nfor natural gas usage is planned as part of  policy of the scenario with\nexisting measures Critical for energy security is the absence of an electricity\nproduction reserve using another technology to hedge for dry years with little\nhydroelectric output In the past, this has led to frequent spikes in electricity\nimports, last observed in 2017 when the net import share in gross energy\nconsumption rose to 39% with net exports of % in both 2016 and Figure 64 shows\nthe total gross inland consumption, remaining rather constant with  slightly\nincrease Generation, net imports and the import share (left -axis) are also\nshown Figure 64: Electricity import share (historical data 2004 - 2018) Apart\nfrom the electricity sector, the supply of fossil fuels and fossil fuel products\nplays  crucial role in Albanian energy security Despite being  crude oil\nproducer, the country is strongly reliant on import of refined oil products due\nto low and aging refinery capacities Figure 65 clearly shows how crude oil\nproduction is significantly higher than the production of refined oil products\nFigure 66 shows net imports of fuel products Negative values mean that exports\nexceed imports while positive values mean that imports exceed exports As can be\nseen, crude oil is largely exported while refined oil products are mainly\nimported This corresponds to  strong import dependency 166 Figure 65:

neighbouring country currently not connected to the Albanian\ntransmission network via interconnectors is North Macedonia (apart from Italy)\nIn February 2020, an agreement has been signed for the construction of  400 KV\ntransmission line with  maximum active power of 1195 MW from Fier through\nElbasan to Bitola in North Macedonia The connection will support the potential\nto build  regional energy market in South East Europe and create trading\nopportunities with countries between Bulgaria and Italy  Energy transmission\ninfrastructure  Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure\nfor electricity and gas To date, Albania does not have  natural gas transmission\ninfrastructure However, the Transadriatic Pipeline (TAP) has started operation\nin late 2020 and connects Italy, Albania and Greece to the Trans- Anatolian\nPipeline in Turkey and the South Caucasus Pipeline in Azerbaijan and Georgia\nThis way, the pipeline can deliver up to 10 billion cubic metres of natural gas\nfrom Azerbaijani gas fields to Italy, Albania, Greece and (through an additional\ninterconnection point) to Bulgaria Due to no existing infrastructure, by the\ntime of writing (April 2021), natural gas from the pipeline has not been used in\nAlbania The following analysis is therefore confined to the electricity\ntransmission infrastructure Information stems mainly from the Albanian\nTransmission Network Development Plan by the transmission network operator OST\n(OST 2018) The Power Transmission System of Albania operates fifteen Substations\n(400 kV, 220 kV, and 150 kV) as well as km of 400 kV lines, 1250 km of 220 kV\nlines,   km of 150 kV line and km of 110 kV lines The main hydroelectric power\nplants of \u201cDrin River Cascade\u201d (Fierza, Koman and Vau Dej\u00ebs) in the Northern\npart of Albania are connected in the 220 kV transmission network, which is also\nthe main connection to the biggest load in the area of Tirana, Elbasan, Durr\u00ebs\nand Fier The 110 kV network covers all urban areas of the country in order to\nsupply the Distribution System that nowadays is operated by OSHEE and is 100%\nstate owned (OST 2018) More than 70% of the total generated installed capacity\nis connected in the 220 kV network Autotransformers 220 kV have  capacity of\n1200 MVA and the 110 kV grid is connected with the 400 kV Rings by two 150 MVA\nAutotransformers installed in the south-eastern part of the network in Zemblak\nSubstation Transmission of electricity from the main sources of generation to\nthe major centres of consumption is done through the 220 kV grid and further\nthrough the 220 kV transformation (2390 MVA) The 110 kV network that supply all\nthe 110 kV substations previously represented the main load nodes while actually\nare connected around 20% of the installed generation capacity (OST 2018) Figure\n73 shows the principal structure of the transmission network in Albania 173\nFigure 73: Albanian Transmission System Structure: Source: OST 2018 ii\nProjections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040 (including for\nthe year 2030) During recent years important projects have been realized that\nhave significantly reduced the share of non-served electricity and the\ntransmission losses From 2005 to 2017, electricity losses in the transmission\nnetworks have fallen from 56% to 08% This number does not include distribution\ngrid losses (OST 2018) According to model calculations from the scenario with\nexisting measures, the annual increase in energy demand amounts to one to two\npercent between 2019 and In sum, electricity demand increases from 512 ktoe in\n2019 to 533 ktoe in 2030 and 621 ktoe in At the same time, production capacities\nincrease from 2343 MW in 2019 to 2965 MW in 2030 and 3228 MW Transmission\nnetworks have to follow the rising load and expansion and further increases in\nefficiency are necessary The Albanian Network Development (OST 2018) plan\nforesees  number of projects for improving transmission networks as presented in\nTable Project Benefits Extension of Koman Substation, with  new AT-345 MVA 400\nkV, 400 kV double busbar and two

the electricity, which means that\nthere is no need for subsidies for fossil fuels 177 Subsidies for renewable\nenergy sources In this regard, the policies for addressing the support schemes\nor the subsidy mechanisms are mainly oriented to promotion of the electricity\nproduction from RES This policy is in compliance with the national target of\nreaching 38% of gross final energy consumption from RES by Law /2017 \u201cOn\npromoting the use of energy from renewable sources (RES)\u201d provides for the\nestablishment of two types of financial support for RES-: \uf0b7 The \"Feed-in-\nTariff\", this is the legal financial support scheme for the purchase price of\nthe energy produced by RES with limited generating capacity up to  MW for PV\nplants and up to  MW for wind farms These projects are approved by the Minister\naccording to the procedures of DCM 822, as amended \u201cOn the approval of the rules\nand procedures for construction of the new electricity

years \uf0b7 Setting the \"Feed-in-Premium\" (FiP tariff) -\nthis is the legal financial support scheme for the purchase price of the energy\nproduced from RES sources with installed generating capacity over  MW for PV\nplants and over  MW for wind farms The methodology of support schemes, according\nto the capacity of the RES plant, is approved by DCM 369 based on the law no\n/2017

sector In Albania, the subsidies applied for fossil\nfuels are limited For the year 2021,  subsidy scheme is going to be applied in\nthe agriculture sector for certain categories of agriculture products The\ndecision also determines the norms of oil consumption per hectare for all these\ngroups and subgroups that oil will be provided free of charge, which according\nto the Council of Minister decision consists in: \uf0b7 exemption from the excise tax\n(37 ALL /lt) (/eq 299 euro) 178 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 exemption from the turnover tax (27 ALL\n/lt) (/eq218 euro); exemption from

fruit\ntrees and vegetables) it will be paid 67 ALL or 54% less The total fund that is\nplanned to be used for the financing of the above-mentioned measures is one\nbillion ALL (approx 809 000 Euro) for the year 2021, of which 950 million ALL\nwill be used for tax subsidy and 50 million ALL for the monitoring of the\nsubsidy scheme The reference price for oil that is going to be used in

IMPACTS OF PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES  Impacts of\nplanned policies and measures, including comparison to projections with existing\npolicies and measures This section addresses Impacts of planned policies and\nmeasures described in section  on energy system and GHG emissions and removals,\nincluding comparison to projections with existing policies and measures (as\ndescribed in section ) Albania has  number of planned additional measures in all\nsectors as described in detail in chapter  This chapter presents outcomes of\nprojections with the planned additional measures on an overall and sectoral\nlevel In analogy to chapter , for better readability, these figures show values\nfor historic trends from the year 2016 to 2018, followed by projections for the\nyears up to 2030, as well as projected values for 2035 and Where appropriate,\nfigures show absolute values, scenario comparisons and breakdowns of\nsubcategories for the differences between the WEM scenario (With Existing\nMeasures) presented in Chapter  and the WAM scenario (With Additional Measures,\ndenoted 'WAM RE full capacity' in the following plots) presented in this chapter\nThe WAM scenario considers that renewable energy plants run full capacity\nindependently from electricity demand in the country This builds on  liquid\nmarket and  high interconnection level As renewable electricity comes with no or\nlimited running costs, there is always  buyer for electricity To analyse the\neffect of this assumption, this document in some cases also shows the results\nfor an alternative scenario in which renewable power generators run to meet\ndomestic demand only This scenario is then called 'WAM RE to meet demand' Note\nthat in most cases, this setup has no influence on results as the surplus\nelectricity is simply exported The renewable power plants do not lead to\nemissions and do not influence the energy demand Main influence of this setup is\non the renewable energy share, both in primary and final energy  Projections of\nthe development of the energy system and GHG emissions and removals as well as,\nwhere relevant of emissions of air pollutants in accordance with Directive (EU)\n2016 under the planned policies and measures at least until ten year after the\nperiod covered by the plan (including for the last year of the period covered by\nthe plan), including relevant Union policies and measures Dimension\nDecarbonisation In terms of GHG emissions, the WEM scenario leads to total\nemissions of Mt CO2eq in 2030, whereas the values in WAM reach Mt CO2eq,

These are the direct emissions from energy\nuse The process emissions and the emissions due to energy transformation are 182\nreported separately The main source of direct emissions is the transport sector,\nwhich is not fully decarbonised by An increase in emissions is also seen in\nindustry In the residential sector (Figure 80)  change in heating and cooking\nsystems towards  higher electrification (heat pumps and direct electrification)\ntogether with  change in demand due to refurbishment and reconstruction lead to\ndrop in direct emissions This is similar for the services sector (Figure 81),\nwhich sees falling emissions particularly in sectors where space heating is the\nmain source of emissions Emissions in industry (Figure 82) are lower than in WEM\ndue to an increase in electrification, fuel switch and an increase in energy\nefficiency Emissions from the transport sector (Figure 83) continue to rise also\nin the WAM scenario, though less than in WEM, due

measures For the share in\ntransport (RES-), this includes the multipliers for the use of electricity in\nroad and rail transport, which explains the strong increase No advanced biofuels\n(with increased multipliers) are considered The share of renewable energy in\nheating and cooling (RES-HC) falls as the share of wood for heating decreases\nThe share of renewable electricity (RES-) is largely determined by hydropower,\nwith increases projected for solar PV Subsequent figures gives technological\ndetails on each RES indicator As these indicators (in particular RES-) is\ndetermined by the RES- generation (numerator) and the net electricity demand\n(denominator), this is strongly influenced by the choice in assuming renewable\npower plants run full capacity, exporting all surplus electricity Figures\ntherefore show both variants of the WAM scenario 197 In overall terms, the\nadditional measures increase the share of renewables in final energy from % (WEM\nscenario) in 2030 to

rate and therefore  rapid introduction of more\nenergy efficient buildings Despite the 209 rise in penetration of space cooling\ntechnologies in Albanian households, the energy consumption for space cooling is\nonly increasing very mildly and finally decreasing again due to the improved\nenergy performance of buildings In the services sector (Figure 110), the public\nsubsectors (public administration, education and health) are expected to\ndecrease energy consumption However, the private services subsectors are\ntargeted by fewer policies and at the same time show  very strong expected\ngrowth, leading to  further growing path in energy consumption In the industrial\nsector, energy demand is expected to rise in every subsector, with the Minerals\nsector still dominating (Figure 112) The rise is lower than in the WEM scenario,\nhowever  growth in this sector is still prevalent In the transport sector,\neconomic growth and the growing need for mobility lead to an increase of energy\ndemand in the sector (Figure 114) The electrification, efficiency gains and\nincrease of public transport cannot counteract this increase This applies to\nboth passenger transport and freight (Figure 116, Figure 118) Energy consumption\nfrom non-energy demand (Figure 120) has been decreasing significantly in the\npast but is expected to increase with an increasing demand in

the\nadditional measures, the import dependency in dry years (assumed in 2022, 2027,\n2032, 2037) is almost eliminated as shown in Figure In other years, Albania is\nexpected to be  net exporter of electricity when running hydroelectric plants on\nfull capacity In normal (not dry) years, the export of electricity is almost at\nparity with local demand, reaching 97% surplus electricity in 218 Figure 121:\nElectricity demand, generation, exports and imports with additional measures\nscenarios with renewable energy generation running at full capacity and\nexporting surpluses (projection 2019 - 2040) WEM and 'WAM RE to meet demand'\n(denoted 'WAM mdem') are also indicated As shown in Figure 122, the bulk of\nelectricity generation is taken over by hydro power plants, which are heavily\naffected by dry years and the effect of climate change (modelled as  decrease to\nhydro availability, see Chapter ) Despite an increase in electricity demand,\nsmall hydro power plants (sHPP in Figure 122) see an increase Gas fired power\nplants are only used in the dry years as they do not run at full capacity but\nserve only as  backup in case of shortage in hydro or other renewable\navailability While the WEM scenario sees the use of the TPPs (only Vlora in case\nof WEM) in every year starting in 2035, this is no longer necessary in the WAM\nscenario with the increased availability of renewable power generation The\nshortage of electricity that triggers the dispatch of the TPP appears in autumn\nand winter of dry years, when solar availability is low 219 Figure 122:\nElectricity generation under the WAM scenario for the different power plants\n(PP,  - hydro, - solar PV,  - wind,  - thermal gas) sHPP are small HPPs that are\naccounted for together, as are auctioned SPPs and WPPs In oil production, the\nincrease of refinery capacity with the refurbishment is expected to increase the\nproduction of oil products as can be seen in Figure The import dynamics will\nchange in the sense that the country will change from being  net exporter of\ncrude oil to domestic use of crude oil without major imports nor exports The\nimports of oil products will decrease to  very small amount, considerably\ndecreasing import dependency as shown in Figure There is an increase in the\ndemand for natural gas, which is imported through the TAP pipeline (Figure 124)\nThe natural gas is used for power generation, but also in the residential (% of\nFEC in 2030) and services sector (% of FEC in 2030), where it replaces the use\nof LPG There is also  limited and declining use of natural gas in industry,\nwhere it is phased out for electricity 220 Figure 123: Fuel production with\nadditional measures (projection ) Figure 124: Fuel Net imports with additional\nmeasures (projection ) 221 ii Assessment of policy interactions (between\nexisting policies and measures and planned policies and measures within  policy\ndimension and between existing policies and measures and planned policies and\nmeasures of different dimensions) at least until the last year of the period\ncovered by the plan, in particular to establish  robust understanding of the\nimpact of energy efficiency/ energy savings policies on the sizing of the energy\nsystem and to reduce the risk of stranded investment in energy supply The\nmodelling results presented in this chapter and for existing measures in Chapter\ndescribe the energy system in aggregated form, considering the policies outlined\nin Chapter  Each individual policy has an individual effect if implemented to\nthe existing system However, the interactions of policies need to be considered\nas this can increase or decrease their effect on the final saving values An\nexample is building policies that, among others, target the replacement of wood\nfired stoves for space heating in favour of electricity powered heating and heat\npumps The fuel switch itself will lead to  decrease in energy consumption\n(especially in the case of heat pumps) but the stronger effect in terms of GHG\nemissions savings occurs in combination with the enlargement of renewable\nelectricity generation All measures that lead to an increase in electricity\nconsumption in favour of another fuel require an adjustment of electricity\nproduction capacity or cross-border interconnectors Similarly, energy efficiency\nimprovements have to be part of planning for electricity supply Without energy\nefficiency measures,  stronger capacity increase for electricity generation is\nnecessary to avoid import dependency Energy efficiency measures can reduce the\npressure on both the production and transmission capacity By accounting for\nsupply, network and demand sides of the energy systems, both GHG emissions and\ncosts for overinvestments in production capacities can be avoided Figure 125\nshows the GHG emission savings for policies and measures implemented in the WAM\nscenario Note that some of the PaMs have not been implemented in the modelling\nas they do not act directly on the system but are nonetheless important to\nfollow Some of the PaMs have been implemented in combination, then  separate\nanalysis is not possible Other PaMs (on renewable capacity) have been split The\neffects of -LF1 and -LF2 are not included in the figure for readability but\ngiven in Figure The total effect of all policies is shown in Figure As becomes\nevident, the joint effect of the policies in WAM (savings of 2347 ktCO2eq in\n2030) is larger than the sum of the separate effects (2321 ktCO2eq in 2030),\nwith this effect increasing over time This difference is due to the interactions\nof the different policies, particularly of energy efficiency and renewable\nenergy PaMs described above Renewable energy plants only lead to emission\nsavings when replacing thermal power plants, as is the case only after 2030\noutside of dry years In other years, they may be replacing imported electricity,\nthe emissions of which are accounted for in the country of electricity\ngeneration On the other hand, the thermal power plant of Kor\u00e7a only leads to\nemissions in dry years, which are not shown in the figure Energy efficiency PaMs\nhave only  small effect as as long as they only reduce the demand for\nelectricity in the system, since there is ample of supply of renewable\nelectricity in any case Nevertheless, and as described above, the energy\nefficiency first principle should be followed There are only few PaMs acting on\nnon-energy emissions in the WAM scenario In terms of total emission savings, the\nforest management has by far the largest effect 222 This discussion shows the\nlimitations of attributing emission savings to individual PaMs The reference\nsystem in which the PaM is implemented needs to be considered As the NECP\nattempts to draw up an integrated plan the effect of interactions between PaMs\nis of essential importance Figure

policies\nalready form part of the Energy Community Treaty 224  Macroeconomic and other\nimpacts of the planned policies and measures, including comparison to\nprojections with existing policies and measures This section addresses\nMacroeconomic and other impacts, to the extent feasible, the health,\nenvironmental, employment and education, skills and social impacts, including\njust transition aspects (in terms of costs and benefits as well as cost-\neffectiveness) of the planned policies and measures described in section  at\nleast until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including\ncomparison to projections with existing policies and measures This section\nspecifically provides an assessment on the non-energy impacts of energy and\nclimate policies, as comprised in this NECP The environmental effects of energy\nand climate policies aiming to increase the share of renewable energies (RE) in\nthe energy system, as well as improve energy efficiency (EE) across different\nconsumption sectors, are mostly evident and well researched To  large extent,\nthe implementation of measures related to EE and to increase the share of RE is\ndriven by the aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate climate change\nand comply with the goals of the Paris Agreement However, both EE and RE\nmeasures can have  range of impacts towards households, employment, private\ncompanies, and the public sector These impacts might be substantial, and can be\ndocumented in different dimensions,  ranging from macro-economic effects\n(impacts on employment, public budgets, value creation, etc), health impacts\n(due to reduced local air and water pollution) social impacts (alleviation of\nenergy or fuel poverty, improved comfort and well-being, reduction of\ninequality), among many others (for an overview, see Bouzarovski (2014))\ncomprehensive estimation of the multiple effects of energy and climate policies\nacross actors and dimensions is beyond the scope of this study This section\nprovides  brief overview on non-energy impacts across three key dimensions,\nnamely: ) disposable household incomes, as  key indicator to measure the impacts\non fuel and energy poverty ) public budgets, to understand if measures have the\npotential to increase or decrease public revenue streams and ) employment, as\nenergy and climate policies bear great potential to provide green jobs\nDisposable household incomes Achieving  substantial decarbonization of the\nenergy sector will require major efforts in the building sectors At EU level,\ngreenhouse gas emissions in the building sector represent more than  third of\ntotal emissions Residential buildings account for 75 % of the European building\nstock, from which more than 40 % was built before 1960 and more than 90 % before\nLow income households represent about 17 % of households in the EU (Eurostat,\n2014), while estimates of EU-inhabitants suffering from fuel poverty ranging\nbetween  million inhabitants, corresponding to roughly \u201321 % of the total EU-\npopulation (Bouzarovski (2014); BPIE (2015); Bird et al (2010)) Energy\nefficiency policies in the residential sector bear great potential to improve\nthe disposable income of households Disposable household incomes can be\nincreased by improved EE in space heating, hot water generation or energy- using\nproducts like fridges or televisions, given that the overwhelming share of all\nimplemented measures are cost-effective (Yushchenko and Patel 2017; Dodoo et al\n2017) Derived from this, EE bears  great potential for the alleviation of energy\npoverty, but additionally induce the multiple benefits of EE, such as improving\nhuman health, lowering energy subsidies through social policies, increased the\nvalue of properties, local spending and employment, reduced emissions, etc\nInitial investments in EE for renovation of buildings usually pay off in terms\nof heating cost reduction, which enables consumers to spend their money\nelsewhere in the long run However, as the evaluation of the German KfW Energy-\nefficient Refurbishment Programme emphasizes, it must be noted that these\ninvestments are profitable after  period of several decades (KfW Group (2018))\nDisregarding investment costs is hence  simplification and likewise the neglect\nof rebound and spill-over effects 225 Public budgets Public Budgets can be\naffected by EE and RE policies in multiple ways For example, changes in public\nbudgets can be triggered by new jobs generated ( by EE measures the building\nsector) On the other hand, policies comprising tax cuts and subsidies towards\ntargeted activities to improve EE and deploy  higher share of RE can go along\nwith higher public spending or reduced tax incomes As an indicator for the\nimpact on public budgets, additional income tax revenues) for  typical average\njob in the related sectors/subsectors can be computed, using country specific\nincome tax rates Losses of income tax in the energy sector can also be\nconsidered in this way here The approach can be extended to other impacts\nrelated to the public budget, such as VAT and energy taxes to calculate positive\nor negative effects on public budgets Employment effects Employment effects can\nbe of great importance, as providing employment opportunities and reducing\nunemployment rates represent key political objectives Direct effects of EE on\nemployment are based on two main drivers: investments in EE measures and related\nenergy savings While the former triggers demand impulses in industries producing\nrelevant technologies, the latter reduces demand related to energy supply in the\nlong run In both cases, these impacts indirectly affect other sectors,  energy\nproducers and distributors As various studies have shown, net employment gains\nare likely to occur when shifting from spending on energy consumption to\ninvesting in EE measures (Wei et al 2010; Scott et al 2008; Bacon and Kojima\n2011) Provided that EE measures are cost-effective they also increase disposable\nincomes, which further stimulates job creation in the long-run Measures\nimproving energy efficiency by construction-intensive activities, such as\nbuildings envelope refurbishment, have also shown to have great potential for\nemployment creation Table 49 presents  qualitative assessment of non-energy\nimpacts of selected PaMs, addressing the dimensions disposable household\nincomes, public budgets and employment18[] The values indicated in the table are\n\u201clow\u201d, \u201cmiddle\u201d, \u201chigh\u201d ( low meaning  PaM only has  minor positive effect on\nthe respective non-energy impact) if  PaM has the potential for respective\neffects on the examined dimensions, and \u201cneutral\u201d, if it has no effect Some PaMs\nrequire either public funds to operate, or comprise tax exemptions to incentive\ncertain activities, thus impacting public budgets in  negative way These effects\nare indicated by  value of \u201cnegative\u201d in the respective impact towards public\nbudgets In general terms, policies improving EE in the residential sector, both\nin the building stock, as well as of appliances and devices, bear potential to\nimprove household\u00b4 disposable incomes and reduce energy poverty Regarding\nemployment, policies requiring construction works, such as building'\nrefurbishments or infrastructure related projects, bear potential to create\ngreen jobs With regard to public budgets, policies triggering high employment\nmight also improve income-tax revenue, thus improving public budget Likewise,\npolicies improving EE of public energy use, such as improved EE in public\nbuildings, can reduce public expenditures for energy and benefit public budgets\n18 Of note, several not-included PaMs are of cross-cutting nature or are\nsupportive or enabling to considered PaMs to achieve its non-energy impacts\nprominent example might be Feed-in tariffs, which as such do not lead to\nemployment effects, but the induced development of power plants does 226 Nr PaM\nName EE-E1 EE-E3 Energy audits for large energy consumers with

Regarding employment effects\nPaMs triggering building renovation action usually have the highest impacts Most\nof the job creation is taking place in the branches construction and\nmanufacturing while having slightly negative effects in the sectors mining and\nquarrying and branches directly related to the supply of energy PaM EE-L1 and\nEE-L2 can be expected to have substantial impact on the employment derived from\nthe energy savings they generate and the additional investments related to these\nThe combined effect can be estimated to create ,500 to 12,000 full-time\nequivalents19 in the period 2019 to As the share of public buildings in the\ntotal building stock is relatively small the main share of these additional\nemployment effects will be generated by the implementation of energy performance\nstandards for buildings and its effect on the renovation activity improving\nresidential buildings Employment effects - Renewable energy The development of\nrenewable energy power plants bears great potential for the creation of\nemployment While the renewable plants would not be manufactured in Albania,\nthere is also  notable effect that can be attributed to the construction phase\nof RE power plants, while its operation is not employment intensive Most of the\nemployment is therefore expected to be created during the construction phase of\nthe power plants Figure 127 shows an estimate of expected employment creation\nduring the construction and operation and maintained phases of solar PV and wind\npower plants It is based on normalized employment factors, whereas normalization\nis carried out from the commonly used unit person-years/MW into the unit jobs/MW\nby assuming  20-year lifetime of projects Results are based on employment\nfactors reported by Cameron and van der Zwaan (2015) in the high bound estimate,\nwho analyses the body of available peer-reviewed scientific literature with this\nregard In particular, solar PV bears potential for green jobs creation In the\nWEM scenario, around 280 MW of solar PV are added to the power system until This\nresults in around 460 jobs in the installation phase, and 460 further jobs in\nthe operation and maintenance phase, resulting in  total of 900 solar PV related\njobs until By  similar metric,  total of 150 jobs are created due to wind power\nplants, with  higher share (two thirds) attributed to the operation and\nmaintenance phase The WAM scenario comprises  capacity addition of 770 MW until\n2030 for solar PV and 450 MW in the same timeframe for wind This results in\naround 1300 jobs in each the installation and operation and maintenance phase\nfor solar PV, or  total of 2600 jobs As for wind,  total of 460 jobs are created\nin the WAM scenario 19 Gross effect not taking to account

or market risk\nfactors or barriers in the national and regional context ii One of the risk that\nmight limit the increase of RES is the constraint on state budget Indeed, the\nmajority of new capacity would be supported, either with FIT/CfD or net metering\nThese support scheme shave an impact on the state budget, through the national\nutilities and the electricity price  Impacts of planned policies and measures on\nother Member States and regional cooperation, including comparison to\nprojections with existing policies and measures This section addresses Impacts\nof planned policies and measures described in section  on other Member States\nand regional cooperation at least until the last year of the period covered by\nthe plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and\nmeasures  Impacts on the energy system in neighbouring and other Member States\nin the region to the extent possible No impact is foreseen for the petrol sector\nThe impacts in the gas sector are the increased capacity to transmit gas through\nTAP and the Ionian Adriatic Pipeline (IAP) The most important impact is within\nthe electricity sector The increase of renewable energy as well as the on-going\nreforms in the electricity sector, most notably the introduction of  power\nexchange, will allow the export of electricity to the neighbouring countries\nIndeed, comparatively, the electricity from Albania would be cheaper than the\nneighbouring countries leading to  reduction of domestic generation 233 in these\ncountries This is especially true thanks to the large transmission capacity\nalready existing in the region Figure 121 shows the amount electricity planned\nto be exported to neighbouring countries ii Impacts on energy prices, utilities\nand energy market integration As mentioned above, the increase of renewable\nenergy will lead to cheaper electricity on the power exchange which would have\nan impact on the regional electricity prices Considering energy market\nintegration, the gas projects, especially the Ionian Adriatic Pipeline will\nenhance the regional integration of the energy markets In addition, the launch\nof the power exchange in Albania which is to be coupled with Kosovo, will also\nlead to greater market integration Finally, the electricity interconnectors\nwould also allow more trade with neighbouring countries iii Where relevant\nimpacts on regional cooperation The improved integration of the gas and\nelectricity sectors of Albania with the neighbouring countries through the\nplanned projects in interconnections and through the liberalization of these\nsectors would impact favourably the regional cooperation 234  References\nRELEVANT DOCUMENTS EU EC, Governance Regulation, 2018:

regulation in the power sector in Albania are\nthe Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (\u201cMIE\u201d) and the regulator, the Energy\nRegulatory Authority (\u201cERE\u201d) In addition to MIE and ERE there are  number of\nministries that have  smaller role in the sector, and also  number of government\nagencies with responsibilities with respect to the power sector that are\ndelegated to them by the ministries Other important Ministries are: Ministry of\nFinance and Economy (\u201cMoFE\u201d); Ministry for Health and Social Welfare; Ministry\nof Tourism and Environment (\"MoTE\") Regulatory bodies and other government\nagencies for energy: Energy Regulatory Authority (ERE): The Energy Regulatory\nAuthority (\u201cERE\u201d) is an independent public body responsible for the regulation\nof activities in the electricity and natural gas sectors ERE is also responsible\nfor the development of most secondary legislation in the sector as well as\napproving the electricity market rules ERE is the competent body for: \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7\nissuing licenses for carrying out electricity generation, transmission,\ndistribution, supply and trade of electricity for approving the grid codes which\ngovern the connection with and access to the transmission and distribution\nnetworks to all power producers approving tariffs in the sector, including feed-\nin tariffs for RES producers, tariffs for access to the transmission and\ndistribution networks, and tariffs for end users supplied by the Universal\nService Provider \uf0b7 Approving the standard industry documents such as the\nstandard PPA, which will be used by priority RES producers Agency of Energy\nEfficiency: is established by  Decision of the Council of Ministers in\naccordance with Law no 124 \u201cOn energy efficiency Duties and responsibilities of\nthe Agency for EE are set out in detail in Article  and 25 of the EE Law, and\ninclude: \uf0b7 Develop secondary legislation and programs to promote energy\nefficiency \uf0b7 Develop and monitor the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan\n(\u201cNEEAP\u201d) and prepare an annual progress report regarding the NEEAP \uf0b7 Work with\nmarket participants and stakeholders to develop  database to monitor progress\nbeing made in improving energy efficiency \uf0b7 Develop technical standards and\nregulations to improve the energy efficiency of products \uf0b7 Evaluate projects to\nimprove energy efficiency for potential funding from the EE Fund \uf0b7 Support\nenergy efficiency through providing advice, training, and developing open source\ncontracts for energy services \uf0b7 Verify the accuracy of data from energy audits,\nif deemed necessary Energy Efficiency Fund: The EE Law mandates the setting up\nof an Energy Efficiency Fund that shall be managed by  Board of Trustees\ncomposed by representatives of different public institutions The revised EE law\nis under consultation and it will be decided if the Energy Efficiency Fund will\nbe established or if it is necessary to create other financial mechanisms for\ninvestments in the field of energy efficiency Currently, is pre estimated that\nthere are no favourable conditions to establish the Energy Efficiency Fund for\nAlbania due to the bottlenecks that were faced since this process has initiated\n(2017) Thus, the related articles might be excluded from the law AKBN \u2013 National\nAgency of Natural Resources: The National Agency of Natural Resources (\u201cAKBN\u201d)\nreports to MIE AKBN mission is the development, supervision of rational use of\nnatural resources, according to the government policy, and monitoring of their\npost-exploitation in mining, petroleum and energy 247 AKPT \u2013 National\nTerritorial Planning Agency and National Territory Council: The National\nTerritorial Planning Agency (\u201cAKPT\u201d) is  public institution subordinated to MIE\nthat is responsible for preparation and coordination of the national planning\ninstruments The National Territorial Planning Agency is in charge of\ncoordinating the land use planning and thus has an important role with regard to\nmaking use of the renewable energy potential which is determined by the\nprovisions in the land laws Energy spatial planning (also called energy zoning\nor energy master planning) has  crucial role in achieving NECP targets The\nNational Territory Planning Agency and its functions are based on Law \"On\nTerritory Planning and Development\" No 28/AZHT - National Agency of Development:\nAZHT has responsibility for making decisions regarding specific projects of\nnational importance This includes, for example, approval of construction permits\nfor projects in the energy sector such as power generation, transmission and\ndistribution, and oil and gas projects AKM \u2013 National Environment Agency:\nNational Environment Agency (\u201cAKM\u201d) is an institution subordinated to the\nMinistry of Tourism and Environment, which is responsible for reviewing and\napproving the environmental impact assessments for large development projects,\nsuch as those in the energy sector The Agency also has responsibilities for\nmonitoring compliance with environmental standards Public Energy Companies In\naddition to the government departments and agencies presented above, there are\nnumber of large public energy companies in Albania who are essentially the\nincumbent state-owned utilities Albania Power Corporation, KESh: KESH remains\nthe dominant electricity generator in Albania, generating ~75% of power\ngenerated in Originally KESh was established as  state-owned, vertically-\nintegrated company comprising all functions of electricity generation,\ntransmission and distribution KESH is also responsible for the administration,\nthe proper operation and guaranteeing the technical and operational safety of\nthe power plants it operates Transmission System Operator, OST: OST is the\nTransmission System Operator (\u201cTSO\u201d) in Albania managing the network at 110 kV\nand above TSO is an independent joint stock company whose shares are owned by\nthe Ministry of Finance and Economy The main responsibilities of TSO are: -\nPower flows management in the electricity transmission system; - System\nbalancing services; - Development of the transmission network to guarantee the\nsecurity of the electricity transmission system; - Covering of network losses\nand providing ancillary services; - Cross \u2013 border capacity allocation; -\nConnecting users with the transmission system network Distribution Company,\nOShEE: OShEE owns the electricity power distribution system below 110 kV OSSHEE\nis the parent company in the capacity of the founding shareholder, establishing\nthree controlled companies, aiming to unbundle the distribution activity, the\nuniversal service of supply and sales for the free electricity market as\nfollows: - Universal Service Supplier  (FSHU) for the \u201cElectricity supply of\nend-customers operating in the regulated market defined by the legislation in\nforce\u201d - Free Market Supplier  (FTL) for the \u201cPurchase and management of\nelectricity and operation in the free market, etc\u201d - Distribution System\nOperator  (OSSH) for the \u201cDistribution of electricity, construction, operation\nand maintenance of the electricity distribution network for the supply of\nelectricity to customers, connection of customers and users of the network\nelectricity distribution, installation and electricity metering services, etc\u201d\nOSHEE  through the Albanian Energy Regulator Authority, transferred its licenses\nto the newly created companies 248 Market Operator (Albanian Power Exchange), is\nthe responsible structure for the management and administration of the organized\nmarket, through the market platform, which will operate in the field of\nelectricity exchange in Albania, in the form of  joint stock company,\nfinancially and legally separated from Transmission System Operator The State\nTechnical and Industrial Inspectorate (STII) is responsible for public safety\naspects of equipment used in power generation, transportation and distribution\nand in maintaining safety in gas infrastructure as well ISHTI is also\nresponsible for monitoring and controlling compliance with the technical\nconditions and norms of plants and installations in the field of hydrocarbons\nranging from exploration and production of crude oil till the sale of final\nproducts by the end consumer Quality control of all fuel products trade and used\nin the territory of the Republic of Albania, is included within the mandate of\nthe Inspectorate ALBPETROL is  wholly government-owned, vertically integrated\noil company that has the exclusive rights for the development of all oil and gas\nfields Most of the oil production over which ALBPETROL has production rights has\nbeen contracted out to foreign companies of which nearly 60% is exported for\nrefining into products elsewhere ALBGAZ is  wholly-owned government company,\ncreated in the form of  combined gas transmission and distribution operator in\nAlbania 249"}
