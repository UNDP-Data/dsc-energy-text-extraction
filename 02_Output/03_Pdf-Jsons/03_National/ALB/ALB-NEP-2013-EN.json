SWH is one of the most promising technologies to reduce electricity and fuel wood\nconsumption in Albania with a significant contribution towards GHG gas emissions reduction.\nThe Global Solar Water Heating Market Transformation and Strengthening Initiative: Albania\nCountry Programme, funded by the Global Environment Facility and implemented by UNDP,\nunder the National Execution Modality, addresses the most common barriers to solar water\nheating development: policy and regulations, finance, business skills, information, and\ntechnology.\nThe UNDP Project will give a contribution regarding the creation and drafting of all SWH bylaws of\ngovernmental decrees. The Energy Efficiency (EE) Center has taken the initiative to develop an\ninitiative aiming at raising the awareness of Municipal staff in what regards the benefits of EE in\nbuildings. It would be important to have these activities integrated and co\u2010ordinated since they all\nhave the same purpose \u2013 save energy, raise competitiveness and avoid polluting emissions.\nAccording to the National Energy Strategy and Albania\u2019s First National Communication and\nTechnology Needs Assessment, over 70% of domestic hot water needs of the household and\nservice sector in Albania is supplied by electric boilers, while the energy demand for hot water in\nAlbania was projected to grow from 600 GWh in 2000 to 875 GWh in 2015, in the residential\nsector alone.\nThe objectives of Albania energy policy are competitiveness, security of supply and sustainability.\nThe Law, No. 138/2013 on Renewable Energy Sources (RES), endorsed by the Albanian\nGovernment, recognises the important role of Albanian municipalities in taking the lead in making\nsolar water heating as a standard solution for all new public buildings and those going through\nmajor renovations.\n\nDEFINITIONS\nAmplification \u2013 the intervention in one existing building that aims at adding a new body, section\nor floor and that has the consequence of augmenting the useful pavement surface.\nAnnual solar energy (design) \u2013 it is the energy expressed in units of final energy, supplied by the\nSWH system, according with the design methodology and estimation method used.\nAnnual solar energy (measured) \u2013 it is the energy expressed in units of final energy, supplied by\nthe SWH system, according with the information made available by the use of an energy\nmanagement system. Measured in the boundaries of the primary circuit of the SWH system, i.e.,\nbefore and after the heat exchanger.\nAppropriate solar exposition \u2013 is the existing roof, in terrace or sloped surface, the latter with a\nperpendicular oriented in a range of azimuths of 90\u00ba between south\u2010east and south\u2010west, that arenot shaded by significant obstacles in the period initiating everyday two hours after sunshine and\nfinishing two hours before sunset.\nAutonomous fraction \u2013 it is a section, floor or apartment within a building which is designed or\naltered to be used separately.\u00a0\u00a0\nBuilding \u2013 in the scope of this STO, it is either the whole part of a property or one of its\nautonomous fractions.\nEnergy management system \u2013 it is an electronic system, composed of hardware and software,\nused for managing the SWH system, including, the supervision, monitoring, command of the\nsystem and its components and the quantification of the energy collected and made useful by the\nSWH system.\nEnergy mix \u2013 is the distribution in percentage terms of the primary energy sources for producing\nelectricity at the national level. This value varies every year, namely in function of the annual\nhydropower generation capacity.\nEnvelope \u2013 it is a building component that defines the boundary between the internal and\nexternal space. It is closely related with the architecture and construction of the \u201cskin\u201d of the\nbuilding but depends also of the physical relations between the \u201cskin\u201d of the building, its structure\nand the other constructive elements.\nFinal energy \u2013 is the energy made available to users under different forms (electricity, natural gas,\npropane, butane, diesel, gasoline, and biomass) and expressed in units with commercial meaning\n(kWh, Nm3\n, kg). \nLarge rehabilitation \u2013 the intervention in the envelope or in the technical installations (energetic\nor not) of one existing building, that should not result in the erection of a new body or section and\nwhich has an estimated cost superior to 25% of the value of the building, excluding the value of\nthe terrain, in the conditions defined in the relevant legislation.\nMonitoring \u2013 in the scope of this STO, it is the accompanying of the SWH system by following a\nprogram of regular and periodic readings and registries of pertinent characteristic parameters.\nThis activity can be executed continuously in real time or periodically.\u00a0\u00a0\nMunicipal energetic matrix \u2013 it is a quantitative representation of all the available energy, in a\nregion under administration of a Municipality, which can be used for all the productive processes.\nIt is essential for the orientation of energy\u2010sector planners in their mission of ensuring production,\nsecurity of supply and rational use of energy. The municipal energy matrix details the energetic\nprofile of the Municipality, separated by activity sectors and energy use typologies. It also details\nthe group of energy forms or vectors of each sub\u00a0\u2010sector and or energy use typology. The\npollution potential of each subsector or energy use typology can be done by correlating the\nenergy matrix with the carbon emissions matrix. The carbon emissions matrix, reflects the\ncorresponding emissions of each sub\u2010sector or energy use typology. The pollution potential of\neach subsector or energy use typology can be indicated in terms of the result of dividing tonnes of\ncarbon by the tonnes of oil equivalent. It is important to refer the difference between the\ncalculation of carbon emissions, taking into account the final energy matrix or the primary energy\nmatrix. From the global perspective, it is more correct to calculate the carbon emissions through\nthe primary energy matrix, because, in that situation, the inefficiencies of the power generationand distribution systems can be included, as well as the inefficiencies of the various fuels for\nprocessing the distribution.\nNearly Zero\u2010Energy Building \u2013 is a building that has a very high energy performance, as\ndetermined in accordance with Annex I of the EU Energy Performance Buildings Directive (recast).\nThe nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant\nextent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on\u2010\nsite or nearby.\nNominal primary energy global needs \u2013 it is the parameter that expresses the quantity of primary\nenergy that corresponds to the pondered sum of the nominal useful energy\u2010needs for heating,\ncooling and production of sanitary hot waters, taking into account the adopted systems or, in the\nabsence of their respective definition, conventional reference systems, and the current utilization\npatterns of those systems.\nNominal useful energy\u2010needs for cooling \u2013 it is the parameter that expresses the quantity of\nuseful energy needed annually to maintain a building or an autonomous fraction with a reference\ninternal temperature during the cooling season.\nNominal useful energy\u2010needs for heating \u2013 it is the parameter that expresses the quantity of\nuseful energy needed annually to maintain a building or an autonomous fraction with a reference\ninternal temperature during the heating season.\nNominal useful energy\u2010needs for producing sanitary hot waters \u2013 it is the parameter that\nexpresses the quantity of useful energy needed to heat the annual average reference sanitary\nwater volume to a temperature of 60 \u00baC.\nPreventive maintenance plan\u00a0\u2010\u00a0\u00a0a set of maintenance tasks and activities that are recommended\nfor each component and part of the SWH system, taking into consideration the good practice of\nthe professional category, the manufacturers instructions and the specific applicable regulations.\nPrimary circuit \u2013 is the hydraulic closed circuit of a SWH system that makes the transportation of\nthe solar thermal energy, collected in the solar collectors, to the sanitary hot water storage\ntank(s).\nPrimary energy \u2013 is the energetic resource that is found available in nature (petroleum, natural\ngas, hydro energy, wind energy, biomass and solar) and is expressed generally in units of\nequivalent mass of petroleum (tonnes of oil equivalent). There are forms of primary energy\n(natural gas, wood, Sun) that can also be made available directly to the final users, being\ncoincident in those cases to final energy.\nRenewable energy \u2013 is the energy with origin in, the Sun (used under the form of light, thermal\nenergy or photovoltaic electricity, of biomass, wind and waves), in the Earth (geothermic) and in\nthe gravitational effect of the Moon and Sun (tides).\nRoofing surface \u2013 is the surface, measured from the inside, of the opaque elements of the\nenvelope, horizontal or with an inclination inferior to 60\u00ba that separates superiorly the useful\nspace from the exterior or from non\u2010useful adjacent spaces.Sanitary hot water \u2013 is potable water at a temperature higher than 45 \u00baC used for showers,\ncleaning, cooking, washing and other specific uses, prepared in an appropriate device and using\nconventional and, or, renewable energy sources.\nSecondary circuit \u2013 is the hydraulic open circuit that ensures the supply and heating of fresh\nwater to the final consumption. The heating process happens with the heat exchange between\nthe primary and secondary circuits, generally with support of an internal or external (to the\nstorage tank) heat exchanger.\nSolar fraction \u2013 is the proportion, in percentage terms, of the thermal load that is satisfied by the\nSWH system.\nThermal load \u2013 is the energy, in units of final energy, needed to satisfy the nominal useful energy\u2010\nneeds for producing sanitary hot waters.\nUseful pavement surface \u2013 is the sum of the surfaces, measured in plan from the inside perimeter\nof the walls, of all the compartments of an autonomous fraction of a building, including dressing\nrooms, internal circulations, sanitary installations, internal sheds and other compartments of\nsimilar function and built\u2010in wardrobes.\nOBJECTIVES OF THE TIRANA MUNICIPALITY SOLAR THERMAL OBLIGATION (STO)\nBy building on the provisions of the RES law (Law No. 138/2013 ON RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES),\nthe Municipal STO aims at making solar thermal applications as a common and obligatory\ncomponent for all new public buildings and those going through large rehabilitation in the area of\nTirana Municipality.\nThe Tirana Municipality STO and respective accessory standards aims also at defining:\nA. The specific type of buildings subject to this obligation (or which should be exempted\nfrom this obligation on technical or cost\u2010efficiency grounds);\nB. The minimum technical and quality requirements applicable for SWH systems, in three\nphases of their overall life\u2010cycle:\ni. design/specification\nii. installation/commissioning\niii. operation\nC. The minimum technical qualifications applicable to SWH designers and installers and the\ncontents to include in specific vocational training and certification schemes for these two\nprofessional categories;\nD. The timeframes for the objectives and targets\nSCOPE OF THE TIRANA MUNICIPALITY STO\n1. All the public buildings under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Tirana, in which\nsanitary hot water needs were identified, are in the scope of this STO, with the exceptionof those public buildings under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Tirana referred in\npoint number 4.\u00a0\u00a0\n2. This STO applies to all buildings referred in point 1 regardless of their age, i.e., it applies to\nnew buildings and existing buildings.\n3. For a complete understanding of the point number 2, in the scope of this STO, the\nfollowing applies:\na. New buildings are buildings being erected for the first time or amplifications of\nexisting buildings.\u00a0\u00a0\nb. Existing buildings are buildings that:\ni. Will be subjected to a large rehabilitation and, or, an amplification\nii. Have energy systems for producing sanitary hot water that will be\nreplaced and, or, rehabilitated\n4. Public buildings exempted from this STO are:\na. Buildings used as places of worship and for religious activities\nb. Temporary buildings\nc. Buildings which have permanently no appropriate solar exposition and that are,\ntherefore, impeded of receiving a profitable SWH system\nd. Historically protected buildings (e.g., monuments)\n5. The Municipality of Tirana shall extend the scope of this STO to non\u2010public buildings\nthrough a governmental order to be published by the Municipality of Tirana/the Ministry\nresponsible for Energy.\u00a0\u00a0\nQUANTIFICATION OF THE TIRANA MUNICIPALITY STO\nThe quantification of the STO follows an approach based on the principle that a minimum\npercentage of the thermal load shall be covered by the SWH system.\n6. In all buildings included in the scope of the STO, considering that there is an appropriate\nsolar exposition, the annual solar fraction of the SWH systems shall be at least 55%, as an\naverage over the annual expected consumption.\u00a0\u00a0\n7. The thermal load shall be calculated through the method described in Annex I.\n8. The Tirana Municipality STO shall have a simulation software tool, to support the design\nof the SWH systems. In particular, the referred simulation software tool shall be able to\nprovide information regarding:\na. The collecting area (number of collectors) of a given SWH system, based on the\nspecification of:\n The annual energy supplied by the SWH system\n9. The only argument for the designer to not comply with the point number 6 is an\nargument related with the absence of, available roofing surface (due to the occupation\nwith other energy systems) and, or, appropriate solar exposition. In this case the solar\nfraction may be reduced to a limit of 35%.\nQUALITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE TIRANA MUNICIPALITY STO\nThe implementation of a STO in a community or country introduces significant alterations in the\nlocal solar thermal market. Without appropriate measures of quality assurance, low quality\ninstallations may occur frequently. To ensure persistence of the solar energy gains and to amplify\nthe acceptance of the Municipal STO and of the solar thermal technology, strict requirements\nmust be verified in the following stages of a SWH system, under this STO.\nDESIGN AND SPECIFICATION OF THE SWH SYSTEMS\nA project with insufficiencies may force the installer to assume the responsibility of defining\ndetails of the installation, for which he is generally not qualified. This may lead to the making of\ndecisions that may compromise the functioning of the SWH system. On the other hand, the lack\nof clear and objective specifications may encourage the use of more economic equipment and\ncomponents, generally with doubtful quality, raising the risks of reliability and contributing to low\navailability levels of the system and loss of credibility of the technology.\u00a0\u00a0\n10. The design of all SWH systems under the scope of this STO must be developed by certified\nSWH systems designers.\n11. The design and specification of all SWH systems under the scope of this STO, including the\nrespective components, must follow the steps defined in the Annex II of this STO.\n12. The certification process of the SWH system designers, referred in the point number 10,\nwill be defined in a governmental order to be published by the Municipality of Tirana/the\nMinistry responsible for Energy, and will consist in the evaluation of the professional\ncompetence of individual candidates, taking into account the performance of the\nindividual candidate in designing and specifying a SWH system, defined and attributed to\nhim, in the scope of a training and coaching program.\u00a0\u00a0\n13. The training and coaching program referred in point number 12 shall be based in the\ncurriculum indicated in Annex III, which includes professional development in security\naspects, commissioning, maintenance and monitoring of SWH systems.\n14. The training and coaching program referred in point number 12 shall be developed,\nadapted and delivered for the following two different stages:\na. Initially, to train and certify the first frontrunners, i.e., a training of trainers.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn this case the evaluation will be based on the performance of individual\ncandidates during:\ni. the referred training and coaching program; and\u00a0\u00a0ii. the first experience of delivering a course to certify SWH systems\ndesigners (i.e., a mentoring session to evaluate and improve training\nskills);\nb. In the following editions, to train and certify the SWH designers\n15. The specification of the SWH systems components shall take into consideration the need\nto choose components with a recognized and accepted certification. In this sense, solar\ncollectors chosen for SWH systems, under the scope of this STO, must have certification\nSolar Keymark, and the other main components (e.g., storage tanks, circulation units,\npiping accessories and safety equipment) must have the mark CE.\n16. For all the SWH systems developed in the scope of this STO, there should exist a\ndocument containing all the relevant information that can serve as:\na. The basis for understanding between the owner and the technician responsible\nby its definition\nb. Provide grounded estimates and transparent information regarding the\neconomical and environmental evaluation of the project\nc. Give orientation to the installer in the execution phase; and\nd. Support the clarification and allocation of responsibility in the case that the\ninstallation presents deficiencies and, or, malfunctioning.\n17. The document referred in the number 16 is of the responsibility of the certified SWH\ndesigner. It should be in a complete version before the procurement process of the SWH\nsystem and should have a structure that addresses, at least, the points indicated in Annex\nIV of this STO.\nINSTALLATION AND COMMISSIONING OF SWH SYSTEMS\nThe installation stage of SWH systems has been, in several European countries, a stage when\nmany mistakes that endanger the reliability and durability of the installations occur. On the other\nhand the essay of all components and fine\u2010tuning of their respective working parameters, before\nentering in operation, helps to adapt the system to the concrete operational context and to the\ntechnical conditions that optimizes the systems\u2019 performance. This STO aims at avoiding the\nconcretization of performance risks in the several stages of a SWH system life\u2010time.\n18. The installation and commissioning of all SWH systems under the scope of this STO must\nbe executed by certified SWH systems Installers.\n19. The certification process of SWH system Installers and commissioning technicians will be\ndefined in a governmental order to be published by the Municipality of Tirana/the\nMinistry responsible for Energy, and will consist in the evaluation of the professional\ncompetence of individual candidates, taking into account the performance of the\nindividual candidate in performing the activities foreseen in a specific training and\ncoaching program.\u00a0\u00a0\n20. The training and coaching program referred in point number 19 shall be based in the\ncurriculum indicated in Annex V, which includes also professional development in security\naspects, maintenance and monitoring of SWH systems.\n21. The training and coaching program referred in point number 19 shall be developed,\nadapted and delivered for the following two different stages:a. Initially, to train and certify the first frontrunners, i.e., a training of trainers.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn this case the evaluation will be based on the performance of individual\ncandidates during:\ni. the referred training and coaching program; and\u00a0\u00a0\nii. the first experience of delivering a course to certify SWH systems\ninstallers (i.e., a mentoring session to evaluate and improve training\nskills);\nb. In the following editions, to train and certify the SWH installers\nMAINTENANCE AND MONITORING OF SWH SYSTEMS\nNowadays SWH systems are planned to have a useful life of about 20 years. Maintenance of SWH\nsystems is a key success factor for assuring high levels of reliability, availability, maintainability\nand security of those systems. On the other hand, in some cultures the energy performance of an\nenergy system is not always related to its reliability. To overcome this issue it is important to\nestablish, in parallel with a preventative maintenance plan, a monitoring plan to have a notion of\nhow is our system performing.\u00a0\u00a0\nMonitoring plans of SWH installations under the scope of a STO are also important to ensure the\nsupply of information to the STO administration entity. Resulting information of a monitoring plan\ncan help characterize the success of the STO or, in case the SWH installations under the STO are\nbeing financed or co\u2010financed by public funds, of how those public funds are being used.\n22. All the SWH systems developed in the scope of this STO must have, at the beginning of\ntheir operation, a preventive maintenance plan proposed by the certified SWH designer\nthat was responsible for the design. The existence of this preventive maintenance plan is\na necessary condition to the emission of the building permit by the competent authority.\n23. The preventive maintenance plan referred in the point number 22 should be developed\naccording with the guidelines indicated in point number 24 and in the Annex VI of this\nSTO. The preventive maintenance plan should be adapted to the specific operational\ncontext, of the SWH system, by the entity or individual responsible for assuming the\nresponsibility of the services contract referred in the point number 30.\n24. The preventive maintenance plan shall include, at least, the identification of:\na. The installation and its location, i.e., building address\nb.

The registry of the maintenance operations and alterations to the installation\nperformed, including the name of the technician who performed said operations,\nthe results of executing the procedures and other eventual pertinent comments\nj. The definition of the parameters to be read and registered for construction of the\nmaintenance historic registry\n25. The preventive maintenance plan of the SWH systems under the scope of this STO, shall\nforesee the need to, access to and intervene in, all the constituting equipment and\ncomponents for maintenance purposes.\n26. In a sheltered technical area of the SWH system there should be, easily accessible:\na. an updated unifilar diagram of the SWH system\nb. a copy of the design document\nc. operating instructions\u00a0\u00a0\nd. emergency instructions\n27. The entities and, or individuals responsible for assuming the responsibility of the services\ncontract referred in the point number 30, must be able to demonstrate, at any time, that\nthey possess the professional aptitude in the scope of this STO, i.e., a professional SWH\nsystems designer and, or installer certificate, to perform the corresponding activities.\n28. All the SWH systems developed in the scope of this STO must have a monitoring plan. Said\nmonitoring plan must define responsibilities for:\na. Data acquisition\nb. Data registry in the maintenance folder of the SWH system\nc. Submission of data to the administrating entity of this STO\n29. The definition of the monitoring plan should follow the guidelines indicated in Annex VII\n30. All the SWH systems developed in the scope of this STO must be, since the beginning of\ntheir operation, subjected to a services contract for:\na. Executing the preventive maintenance plan referred in point number 22\nb. Executing any other activity related with the reliability assurance of the system\n(e.g., corrective maintenance, fine\u2010tuning to improve performance, satisfy legal\nwarranties over deficiencies in the installation)\nc.

The entity or individual responsible for the installation of the SWH system\u00a0\u00a0\nl. The entity or individual responsible for the design of the SWH system\nm. Any other entity or individual possessing a certification of installer and, or,\ndesigner of SWH systems as mentioned in this STO.\n32. The activities in the scope of the services contract referred in the point number 30 are of\nthe responsibility of the services supplier. However, the contracting authority(Municipality of Tirana) as administrator of this STO and owner of the buildings in which\nthe SWH systems will be installed and working, should include in its management\nactivities procedures for monitoring the quality of the services provided by these service\nproviders.\u00a0\u00a0\nMUNICIPAL TARGETS FOR SOLAR WATER HEATING IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS\n33.

The existence of results of the first training courses, for designers and installers,\nafter the Training of Trainers referred in the point number 34.a.ANNEXES\nANNEX I \u2013 METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE SHW THERMAL LOAD\nThe daily thermal load is calculated by using the following expression:\nDailyThermalLoad \uf03d (Vshw* \uf072 w ) *Cw *\uf044T /1000\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt is suggested that the design of SWH systems is made by realizing the following sequence of\nactivities:\n\uf0b7 Collecting information about the building, the hot water needs and the expectations of\nthe building owner, regarding the SWH system to produce. This activity can be carried out\nby using the check\u2010list provided in Annex X of this STO.\n\uf0b7 Simulating the SWH system in a software simulation tool as referred in point number 7 of\nthis STO, i.e., quantify the collecting surface, the solar fraction and the annual solar\nenergy obtainable.\n\uf0b7 Define the line\u2010up of the collectors and the physical characteristics of the primary circuit.\n\uf0b7 Define the filling pressure of the primary circuit, specify the safety components and\ndefine their location in the circuit.\n\uf0b7 Define the SWH system configuration (technical drawing, identification of components\nand map of quantities)\n\uf0b7 Define the backup system\n\uf0b7 Calculate the economical and environmental viability of the installation (ROI, NPV)\n\uf0b7 Describe the sequence of activities for the installation execution\n\uf0b7 Describe the procedures for final cleaning and commissioning of the SWH system\n\nThe proposed programmatic content is expected to respond to the training needs of professionals\nthat are willing to become specialized in the design of SWH systems of medium\u2010\u00a0and large\u2010size.\nThe proposed curriculum will deliver a level of knowledge to participants such that, since the\nbeginning of the definition of the system, there will be the potential to condition the operation,\nthe cost, the durability, the performance and the maintenance cost of the installation.\nThe certification process of SWH designers initiates with the candidacy of the individual\ncandidates. There will be no pre\u2010requisites. The training and coaching program consists of seven\n(7) days in class. Four (4) days will be used to deliver knowledge from the trainer to the\nparticipants. The three (3) last days will be used to initiate and elaborate on the practice exercise,\ni.e., designing with support of the trainer a medium\u2010size SWH system according with the\ninformation contained in Annex II and Annex IV of this STO.\nAfter the seven (7) days in class, totalling 56 hours, the participants will have 10 useful days to\ncomplete the SWH system design and the document referred in the number 15. The final work\nwill be subjected to the evaluation of the trainer. The participant will have two opportunities to\nsee his work evaluated. The evaluation will be made objectively and taking into account the\nevaluation grid included in Annex VIII.

However, low\nelectricity prices and non\u2010payments are obstacles to the penetration of this carbon\u2010free source of\nuseful energy. Nevertheless, solar panels are already available on the market and significant\nvolumes have been installed. According with the national Agency of Natural Resources of Albania,\nin 2010, a total of 10,700 m2 were installed (60% by services, 40% by households), bringing total\ninstallations to 52,000 m2 (equivalent to around 70 GWh/y or 1% of electricity consumed by\nhouseholds in 2009). UNDP is supporting a programme (2011\u20102015) to install 50 thousand m2 of\nsolar panels based on grants and fiscal incentives.\nIn Tirana, the daily average solar radiation in each month is given in the table below.\nTable 1 \u2013 Monthly daily average solar radiation [kJ/m2]\nCounty Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May Jun. Jul. Aug. Sep. Oct. Nov.

It can be seen that Tirana is located in a region\nwhere there is an annual average of 1500 [kWh/m2\n] and where it is possible to have a SWH\nsystem operating during more than 2500 hours per year.MUNICIPAL VISION OF A SOLAR WATER HEATING FRAMEWORK\nGenerally composed of solar thermal collectors, an hydraulic circuit to carry the thermal energy\ncollected and a storage of the thermal energy, SWH systems provide a simple, cost\u2010effective, and\nsustainable means of heating water for domestic and other uses. In addition to reducing Green\nHouse Gas (GHG) emissions, SWH systems offers a host of potential benefits to governments\nseeking to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and, or, reducing energy importations and\nimproving the overall efficiency of their energy sector, in both perspectives \u2013 supply and demand\nsides. In countries where power demand is exceeding capacity, SWH can reduce pressure on the\nnational power system and diminish pollution produced by conventional energy sources.\nThe contribution of SWH for the Nearly Zero\u2010Energy Buildings (NZEB) concept can be very\nsignificant, especially in residential buildings and in those buildings where there is a significant\nneed of heat for preparing sanitary hot waters. The NZEB concept is related to the development\nof buildings that have a very high energy performance and therefore require a very low amount ofenergy to comply with its function. Moreover, the low amount of energy required should be\ncovered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from\nrenewable sources produced on\u2010site or nearby. The NZEB concept is being widely studied through\nall Europe and is expected to be mainstream from 2018 onwards (on new public buildings) and\nfrom 2020 onwards (on all buildings).\nGiven the crisis in the EU construction sector, it is expected that new incentives and obligations\nwill redirect the construction companies\u2019 efforts for the urban rehabilitation and, therefore, the\nNZEB concept eventually start being applied also to the existing buildings, which hide the greatest\npotential to avoid energy use.\nEnvironmental benefits of a SWH framework are the direct and indirect reduction of GHG\nemissions. Direct reduction of GHG emissions are obtained by the avoidance of using fossil\u2010fuel\nbased primary energy sources to prepare sanitary hot waters. Indirect reduction of GHG emissions\nare obtained, for example, by the avoidance of overheating of buildings, the reduction of the\nheat\u2010island effect and by the avoidance of transporting fossil\u2010fuel based primary energy from\noutside the boundaries of the city to the city (e.g., LPG, natural gas, diesel). The environmental\nperformance of cities can be well characterized and monitored using and implementing the\nconcept of Energetic Matrix.\u00a0\u00a0\nEconomic and social benefits of a SWH framework include the creation of new (and eventually\ncertified) professional categories, enhanced employment opportunities and the creation of small\nand medium\u2010sized SWH businesses. The development of such businesses and maturation of the\nrespective market could lead to improved product quality and professional culture.\u00a0\u00a0\nKEY CHALLENGES\nThrough all Europe, and especially in the South European countries, solar thermal is a key\ntechnology to address multiple current challenges such as sustainable development, green\neconomy, population growth, housing, quality of life, resource efficiency, energy efficiency,\nclimate change and poverty eradication.\nAlbanian challenges are a combination of the global challenges with particular challenges of\nAlbania as a state with a transitional economy. From the analysis made to the available\ninformation, it was possible to identify several aspects and market barriers that must be\naddressed by the implementers of the Tirana Municipality STO in order to achieve the objectives\nof the STO and to promote the creation, development and sustained growth of a solid solar\nthermal market.\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 Lack of installations working in a correct and effective manner\n\uf0b7 Lack of installations working and subjected to a monitoring program\n\uf0b7 Lack of knowledge from the public in general regarding the benefits of SWH and Energy\nEfficiency (EE)\n\uf0b7 Lack of service providers (companies) duly qualified and certified by an accredited\ncertification body\u00a0\u00a0\uf0b7 Lack of individual technicians qualified and certified, by an accredited certification body,\nto perform the activities of design, installation, commissioning, maintenance and\nmonitoring of SWH systems\n\uf0b7 Lack of financial incentives to promote not only the final users of SWH systems but also:\no The construction stakeholders (supporting the over\u2010cost of new constructions);\nand especially\no The entrepreneurs that know and believe in the benefits and potential of SWH\nand that may want to create their business in the area.\nGENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS\nIt is not uncommon to see countries that have loads of laws and regulations that, although\ntechnically perfect, do not work as initially expected. There are at least two major reasons for this:\na) The high level of complexity of the Regulations;\nb) The inadequate instrumental and operational structure of the Regulations to ensure its\nintegrity.\u00a0\u00a0\nRegarding point a), the complexity of the law makes it difficult to be applied and constitutes a\ngeneral barrier to its fructuous implementation. This is even clearer if the object of the new law is\na \u201cnew subject\u201d, as it is for the case of SWH in Albania.\nTherefore, it is recommended that the regulation should be simple and clear to be, easily applied,\nless expensive to manage and to more easily convince all stakeholders that the application of the\nlaw will benefit the community.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe regulation shall establish in a clear and direct way the linkage of activities to be done, the\nentities responsible implicated and the respective timeframes that must be satisfied by the\nimplicated parties, e.g., operational structure of the STO and its target groups (time of entering\ninto force, actors, deadlines, documentation to present, periodicity of inspections, training and\ncertification of professionals, \u2026).\nRegarding point b), the initial operational structure must be carefully balanced in order not to\ncompromise the integrity of the standard, in one hand, and to ensure that the implementation\nand maintenance costs are kept as low as possible, on the other hand. The integrity of a standard\ncan be measured by the respective levels of Monitoring, Verification and Enforcement (MV&E).\nMonitoring comprises the collection and analysis of data to give an accurate picture of the STO\nprogress and compliance, and is usually an on\u2010going process. It provides the opportunity to\nidentify and act on any implementation issues, as well as providing data for the STO evaluation.\nVerification is the process of determining whether the SWH systems are being developed\naccording with the requirements of the STO (e.g., quality requirements).\nEnforcement is about responding to non\u2010compliance offences with a suite of timely and\nappropriate actions. When developing a STO it is essential to consider not only how non\u2010\ncompliance will be detected, but also how it will be responded to and by whom. When instancesof non\u2010compliance are not responded to as often or as appropriately as they should be, there are\nnegative repercussions on the STO integrity. If participants see that the penalties for non\u2010\ncompliance are low, then there is less motivation for them to comply, particularly if the costs of\ncompliance are seen to be high. The STO administrators should consider the design and\nimplementation of procedures for responding to non\u2010compliance offences.\u00a0\u00a0\nA VISION OF EU STANDARDS ON STO\u00a0\u00a0\nThe experience has been showing that there has been in the several EU regulations concerning\nenergy use in buildings, a merging of measures that promote renewable integration and EE\nimprovement. In fact, the need to save conventional (fossil\u2010fuel based) energy, through, namely,\nthe limitation of energy demand, the increase of the thermal energy systems efficiency and the\nintroduction of renewable energy collected locally or nearby, made clear that it is necessary to\nestablish an integrated \u201cbundle of policies\u201d in the direction of the Nearly Zero\u2010Energy Buildings.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne key aspect hat must be reflected in this \u201cbundle of policies\u201d is that of quality. It is essential,\nfor the benefit of the users, the market and the credibility of the STO, to integrate certification\nschemes in key aspects of the STO as well as technical and, or, performance requirements.\nExamples of these aspects are:\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 Certification of components of the SWH system (e.g., the collectors);\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 Certification of the designers for medium and large size installations;\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 Certification of installers for installations of all sizes;\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 Introduction of technical requirements, such as reference to EU Standards and\ncomprehensive maintenance plans;\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 Integration of requirements for reliability assurance, such as the existence of a valid\nmaintenance contract during the useful life\u2010time of the SWH system;\n\uf0b7 Integration of performance requirements, such as persistence of a given Solar Fraction\n(SF) and, or, annual productivity.\nAnother aspect to reflect in the Tirana Municipality STO, as a general good practice and for the\nbenefit of overcoming existing barriers, is that of the public awareness. Parallel to the\nimplementation of the STO, the public in general must have easy and free access (e.g., on\u2010line\naccess, solar thermal municipal knowledge centre) to information about the work being\ndeveloped by the operational structure of the STO. Examples of relevant information are:\n\uf0b7 Lists of certified equipment that exist in the market (national/international);\n\uf0b7 Lists of local certified professionals (designers and installers);\n\uf0b7 List of institutions that promote the training of all stakeholders and the qualification and\ncertification of SWH systems professionals;\n\uf0b7 Annual scheduling of training and coaching programs for certification of preofessionals;\n\uf0b7 Technical description of SWH systems and respective individual integrating equipment;\n\uf0b7 Manuals containing guidelines;\n\uf0b7 Data and graphics illustrating the chronological rate of penetration of SWH systems in the\nmarket (desirable before and after STO implementation to have better perception of the\neffect);\uf0b7 Initiatives of financial incentive for voluntary integration of SWH systems.\nTHE SCOPE OF A STO\nSTO\u2019s are generally applied to new and existing buildings subjected to large refurbishments and,\nsometimes, when there is the need to replace water heating systems. Although it would be\ndesirable to integrate all buildings in a STO, pondering on the existing limitations is\nrecommended. The first STO ever, a 1980 Israeli law, had encompassed only the residential\nbuildings with a height up to 27 meters. Very tall buildings and non\u2010residential buildings were not\nconsidered in the scope of the law.\nThe following group of criteria can be used to determine the type of buildings to include in the\nscope of an STO:\n\uf0b7 Type of use (residential; non\u2010residential; seasonality);\n\uf0b7 Localization (i.e., climatic zone);\n\uf0b7 Age (new/existing buildings);\n\uf0b7 Hot water needs (litre/day or litres/year, SHW temperature);\n\uf0b7 Dimension (total net area; height; number of autonomous fractions)\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 Energy consumption\nThe following group of criteria can be used to determine the type of buildings to exempt of the\nscope of an STO:\n\uf0b7 Buildings used as places for worship or religious activity;\n\uf0b7 Temporary buildings;\n\uf0b7 Protected monuments;\n\uf0b7 Buildings under permanent shading;\n\uf0b7 Buildings not included in the scope of the STO.\nIt is a success key factor to define as clear as possible the scope of the STO (i.e., buildings in the\nscope and buildings exempted), in order not to affect its intention and not to allow circumvention\nof the rules.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Tirana Municipality is already limiting the scope of intervention of the STO to develop, to the\nuniverse of Public buildings. This seems wise and advisable at the first glance, but it is\nrecommended just for the purpose of highlighting the intention of being the Public Authority to\nset the example; progressive extension of the scope of the STO to other buildings (e.g., private\nbuildings) is recommended because of the cost\u2010benefit analysis of applying the STO.\nQUANTIFYING THE OBLIGATIONThe critical aspect of an STO is the minimum proportion of solar energy contribution to the overall\nthermal load for water heating purposes (i.e., the solar fraction). A STO must define clearly:\n\uf0b7 A quantitative and qualitative definition of the obligation; and\n\uf0b7 A unequivocal description of the calculation procedure.\nThe following approaches are possible:\n1. The STO stipulates the SF of the SWH system (e.g., 40 %\u00a0\u2010\u00a080 %). This SF can vary\ndepending on several parameters (e.g., the use of the building; hot water needs;\navailability of solar energy; availability of area to install solar collectors).\nSWOT Analysis, [3]\u00a0\u00a0\nStrengths\ncorrectness and precision: giving different\nvalues for the obliged share, taking into account\ndifferent parameters (building size, climate,\netc.) and requiring a specific calculation allow to\nmeet precisely the requirements; for instance,\nthe efficiency of the solar collector could be\nincluded in the calculation;\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom the point of view of communication, it is\neasy to understand how much solar really\ncontributes to the hot water demand and\ntherefore to the energy savings in buildings.\u00a0\u00a0\nWeaknesses\u00a0\u00a0\ncalculations should be first performed and then\nchecked; this means that both designers and\nMunicipality staff (or other actors in charge of\nthe checks) should be adequately trained.\u00a0\u00a0\nthe approach is practically applicable only to\nsolar domestic hot water systems. It is not\napplicable for systems for combined domestic\nhot water preparation and space heating.\n\nThreats\u00a0\u00a0\nsimplified tools and standard calculation\nmethods should be provided and their correct\nuse should be carefully checked; otherwise, any\napplicant could do his/her own 'tricks' for not\nfulfilling the obligation;\u00a0\u00a0\nthe above tools should be for free, cleary visible\non web sites and easily downloadable;\u00a0\u00a0\ndo not allow exemptions or lowering of the\nminimum share based on too generic 'technical\nimpossibility' to install the solar thermal plants.\n2. Making a relation between the minimum solar collecting area to be installed and some\nwell known and standardized figures of the construction sector, such as, square meters of\nuseful area or number of occupants. For this method to be precise, it will be needed to\ndefine parameters for the specific climatic zone and parameters related with the solar\ncollector\u2019s technology.SWOT Analysis, [3]\u00a0\u00a0\nStrengths\u00a0\u00a0\nthis approach is easy both for calculating the\namount of solar thermal to be installed and\nalso for checking the fulfilment;\u00a0\u00a0\nit is applicable for both applications of solar\nplants, domestic hot water preparation and\nspace heating;\u00a0\u00a0\nit uses figures which designers and\nMunicipality staff are quite familiar with (floor\narea, number of occupants and which should\nbe anyway communicated when asking for\nbuilding permission.\nWeaknesses\u00a0\u00a0\nnot precise and not correct on a\ntechnical/scientific basis, since we only talk\nabout m2 of 'solar thermal', without taking into\naccount the efficiency of the collector; defining\na set of values depending on the efficiency\ncould avoid this problem;\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom the point of view of communication, solar\nthermal is something which is expressed\nthrough m2 and not through the produced\nheat. Presently the solar thermal markets are\nchanging to the use of kWth instead of m2 for\ndefining the size and capacity of solar heating\nsystems. Following this development it is\nshould be considered to specify the obligation\nin kWth collector capacity per m2 and per\noccupant.\nOpportunities\u00a0\u00a0\nN/A\nThreats\u00a0\u00a0\ndefine precisely which area of solar thermal we\nare referring to ('gross', 'aperture', 'absorber');\u00a0\u00a0\ndo not allow exemptions or lowering of the\nminimum values based on too generic\n'technical impossibility' to install the solar\nthermal plants.\nThe first approach is a more simple and easy to understand option, besides being more precise,\nsince it is more directly related with the purpose of the system. The second option can become\ncomplex and become a source of questions from the interested parties involved.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor the Tirana Municipality STO the use of the approach described in point 1 above is\nrecommended.\nGiven that Tirana has very good solar radiance a high threshold could in principle be placed.\nHowever, as the economical aspect of SWH systems must not constitute a discouraging factor, the\nTirana Municipality STO should be implemented with a moderate level of SF. Ideally there should\nbe a range of acceptable SF to be taken into account when designing a SWH system (55\u201065) and a\nsolution to exceptions that can eventually surge when the application of the STO begins.Experience has shown that a high solar fraction (e.g., > 70%), does not mean cost optimality of\nminimum SWH requirements. The next figure is a tendency curve of the SF of a SWH system in\nfunction of the collecting area. It was placed here to illustrate the idea that it may be better\nhaving a system with a moderate SF and operating with high levels of global efficiency instead of a\nvery high SF and a system with lower global efficiency.\nFigure 3 \u2013 Solar Fraction (%) of a SWH system vs Collecting Area (m2)\nFor this graphic, 13 simulations were done in the SOLTERM dimensioning tool. It can be noted\nthat the last 6 simulations correspond to values of SF between 80% and 90% and that the\ncorresponding increments in SF associated with the increase of collecting area is progressively\nsmaller. It should also be noted that from simulation n\u00ba 6 (Collecting area = 14,22 m2 | SF =\n75,4%) the simulation resulted in the generation of wasted energy, i.e., solar energy that was\ncollected but that will not have use/be useful, taking into account the application foreseen for the\nSWH system (in this case, preparation of SHW). These facts constitute valorous information for\ndefining the cost optimality of the minimum SWH requirements, to be established in a STO.\nOn the other hand, the optimization of the NPV of a SWH system implies the collection of a\nsignificant amount of solar energy, to ensure the profitability of the investment. Calculating the\nNPV of the system, i.e., the accumulated cash flows provided by the operation of this SWH\nsystem, one can have a perception of the exact collecting area that provides economical\noptimization of a SWH system.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe SOLTERM tool has this optimization process integrated in its functionalities. Using this specific\nexample, a designer could dimension the SWH system for a collecting area immediately below the\nthreshold of waste generation (14,2 m2 \u2013 6 collectors). However, after integrating all the relevant\ninformation to have a clearer picture of the economics of this SWH system, the designer can\nconclude that the collecting area that optimizes the NPV of this specific SWH system is lower than\nwhat was defined just by analysing the annual performance of the system (9,5 m2 \u2013 4 collectors).\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Municipality of Tirana, as a leader in Albania for the implementation of STO, given the\npotential national interest, should strive to have the support of the Ministry responsible for\nEnergy and, or the UNDP, to initiate the procurement of a simulation software tool, perfectly\nadapted to the conditions and needs of the STO. Said software tool, eventually useful also for the\nAlbanian Buildings Energy Performance Certification System, should be able to be further adapted\nto encompass the climatic conditions of all the Albanian territory.\nFigure 4 \u2013 SOLTERM output related with the economical optimization of a SWH system, using the NPV method\nFinally, using the value of collecting area that optimizes the NPV (9,5 m2) and the graphic of Figure\n3, the SF of the economically optimized SWH system is approximately 62 %.\nThere are other software tools, such as POLYSUN and, or, T\u2010SOL, that can be indicated for the\npurpose of being considered as the tool to be used in the scope of the Tirana Municipality STO.\nThe SF is naturally related with a given Thermal Load (TL). The TL\u2019s to consider for the STO should\nbe the hot water needs of several types of buildings. The following table taken from [1], gives an\nindication of reasonable values of hot water needs for several types of buildings. These figures\npresuppose that the hot water piping of the secondary circuit is thermally insulated.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe units in which the hot water needs are expressed must facilitate the design of the SWH\nsystem, in particular the dimensioning of the storage tank(s). It is good practice that the storage\ntanks are dimensioned with the following criteria: the volume of the storage tank(s) must be\nequal to the daily hot water needs.\n\nThese values can be used for the Tirana Municipality STO providing that the design of the\nsecondary circuit comprehends thermal insulation in the hot water piping.\nEXAMPLES\nSeveral approaches used in Europe to define the solar collectors\u2019 mandatory surface.\n1\u00a0\u2010\u00a0The Portuguese legislation requires 1 m\u00b2 of standard solar collector per occupant of the\nresidential building.\n2\u00a0\u2010\u00a0The regulation in Murcia, Spain, demand that the system covers 60\u201070% of the heat needs to\nproduce sanitary hot water.\u00a0\u00a0\n3\u00a0\u2010\u00a0The German law of renewable heat and the regional law of Baden\u2010W\u00fcrttemberg of renewable\nheat demands that, for the existing buildings and for the new buildings, 10 to 20 % respectively of\nthe global energy needs for heating are covered by renewable energy sources. This is\naccomplished when 0,04 (m2 of solar collector / m2 of useful pavement surface), is installed.\nQUALITY REQUIREMENTS\nWithout appropriate measures to ensure, quality of SWH systems installations and persistence of\nSWH systems performance, there can be frequently installations of low quality that will generate\nlower solar energy gains than expected and will affect the credibility of the STO and eventually\nthe credibility of the technology. This latter is more probable in markets with low penetration of\nsolar thermal (as it is the case in Albania). Therefore the regulations must be conceived in a way\nto ensure that the products used in the SWH systems, the planning/design of the SWH systems,\nthe installation, commissioning and maintenance/monitoring of the SWH systems are according\nwith the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art.\nThe STO should not include to much technical requirements if it will not be possible to confirm\nthem all and if, by doing so, the technological innovation and development will be impeded.\nThe quality requirements should be:\n\n\uf0b7 Applicable (e.g., certified products and, or, services only if in the market there is a\nsignificant quantity available; otherwise the STO must establish deadlines to accomplishthe certification requirements included in the STO). Even if there are not many internal\nsuppliers, Albania is a member of the World Trade Organization and can, therefore, access\neasily the EU market.\n\uf0b7 Inclusive, i.e., include quality requirements for the services needed in the main stages of\nthe SWH systems (from planning/design to maintenance/monitoring) and for the\nproducts/components;\n\uf0b7 For the services, several requirements should be established, e.g.:\no Design (certified designers; accredited training centres/entities)\no Installation (certified installers; delivery of a specific maintenance plan; accredited\ntraining centres/entities);\no Operation and Maintenance (maintenance contract valid for a given number of\nyears; energy performance contract; monitoring of the system; random\ninspections);\n\uf0b7 For the products and components, it is preferred that Albanian or European standards are\nused (e.g., solarkeymark for solar collectors). If different schemes are created and, or,\nadopted the market may become fragmented, the competition will be reduced, the\ncertification costs will be higher all with disadvantage to the final users;\nEXAMPLES\n1\u00a0\u2010\u00a0The Solar Keymark is the first internationally recognized quality mark for solar thermal\nproducts and it is based in three main imperatives:\n\uf0fc Testing of the initial type of collector through the methodologies described in the\nEuropean Normatives EN 12975 or 12976\n\uf0fc Having implemented a Quality Management System for the manufacturing process\n\uf0fc Ensuring annual revision of the Quality Management System and submitting the product\nto a bi\u2010annual inspection\nSometimes the market feels as if it is awash with a large variety of standards and directives to\nachieve the necessary market compliance. To simplify understanding of achieving EU market\nneeds:\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0fc The obligatory CE marking shows conformity with European directives.\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0fc The voluntary Keymark certifies conformity with European standards and so offers market\nopportunities.\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0fc National marks certify conformity with requirements of national Member State\ncertification schemes.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf the EU has produced a directive relevant to a particular product, then manufacturers selling\nthat product have to show conformity by attaching the relevant CE mark. For the time being, only\nvery large collectors can be CE marked. In the next 5 to 10 years, it is anticipated that collectors\nwill need a CE mark.\u00a0\u00a0The Solar Keymark is a voluntary third\u2010party certification mark, introduced by CEN and CENLEC\n(the European Committee for Standardisation introduced the Keymark) and developed by ESTIF\n(the European Solar Thermal Industry Federation) and CEN, with the support of the European\nCommission. By obtaining the Solar Keymark, the solar product qualifies for nearly all the\ndifferent Member State regulatory and financial incentive schemes. The voluntary Solar Keymark\nscheme encourages the further expansion of the European solar thermal market by improving\nmarket confidence in solar products.\u00a0\u00a0\n2\u00a0\u2010\u00a0In Portugal besides the existence of a certification scheme for installers, ADENE(*) is\ndeveloping, in partnership with CERTIF(*), a certification scheme for SWH systems Designers. As\nthe thermal regulation for buildings is to be reformulated, one aspect that is expected to be\nincluded is that medium\u2010\u00a0and large\u2010size SWH installations (mandatory according with the\nbuildings thermal regulation) will require a design developed by a certified designer.\u00a0\u00a0To be a\ncertified designer, one must conclude successfully a training/coaching course (with classification\nabove 90%) and have significant experience (still to be defined).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n3 \u2013 In France, Qualisol is a qualification of installers that includes 10 compromises (from advisory\nto the after sales). It is a voluntary compromise valid for three years, but with annual renovation.\nTo become a Qualisol company, the organization must demonstrate that possesses technical\ncompetency in solar thermal, through previous experience and, or, professional development\ncertificates. Within the three years of the compromise, the certification organization (Qualit\u2019EnR)\nwill execute a quality audit to one installation done by the installer.\nThe audit is presented as a pedagogic tool for the installer and a confidence mark for the\ncustomer. Depending on the number of non\u2010conformities, the results of the audit may vary from,\n\u201cperfect service\u201d to \u201cfailed installation\u201d. Based on the result the installer will maintain, or not, the\ncommercial quality certificate. In 2008 more than 5000 audits were done (> 1 M\u20ac spent), and\nmore than 85% passed the threshold.\nARCHITECTONIC ISSUES AND PROTECTED BUILDINGS\nA well developed STO should include requirements about architectural integration and clear rules\nabout what buildings are exempt of complying with the law, e.g., for historic reasons. Naturally\nthat the requirements for architectural integration of SWH systems in new buildings, should be\nmore tight than those for existing buildings (under large rehabilitation).\nAt this respect, the STO should include simple rules, i.e., rules that are easy to verify and to\nexecute. For example:\uf0b7 Installation in plane roofs or terrace: consider the height of the existing platband and\ndefine it as the maximum height of the solar collectors\u2019 field to minimize the visual\nimpact. The orientation should be free. However preferential orientations can be\nspecified so that the visual impact is reduced and the efficiency of the system is\naugmented.\n\uf0b7 Installation in tilted roofs: the solar collectors should have the same orientation and\ninclination of the roof. The use of supporting structures should not be allowed.\n\uf0b7 In new buildings with tilted roofs the architecture should foresee the need to have at\nleast one slope of the roof with sufficient surface and favourable inclination and\norientation.\n\uf0b7 In new buildings with tilted roofs the architecture should foresee the need to have a good\naccess to the roof (to allow passing materials and persons).\n\uf0b7 In historical areas, instead of just impeding the installation of SWH systems, special\nrequirements may be established for their architectonic integration.\nThe STO should not exempt too many types of buildings and the exemption criteria should not be\nvague.\nEXAMPLES\nIntegration of SWH systems in the historical and protected area of Lisbon\u2019s down\u2010town.\nThe buildings located in the Portuguese protected areas or belonging to the historic patrimony\nare exempt of the thermal regulation (which imposes the use of SWH systems to produce SHW).\nAlthough it can be accepted that the historic patrimony should be preserved, this exemption\nconduces several times to a situation where the investors and promoters of the construction\nindustry (especially of residential buildings in protected areas) will try to escape of complying\nfrom the thermal regulation. To overcome this tendency it is important to adapt residential\nprotected buildings to modern patterns which include the possibility to integrate technologies to\ncollect and convert solar energy.\nIn the context of the urban requalification of the Lisbon down\u2010town, the Municipal Energy Agency\n(Lisboa\u2010Enova) in cooperation with the Municipality and IGESPAR (the entity responsible for the\nmanagement of the national archaeological and architectural patrimony) promotes the\ndevelopment of the \u201cPotential for integration of solar technologies in the Lisbon\u2019s down\u2010town\u201d.\nThe application (an IT web based platform), allows the identification of the solar potential for all\nthe buildings in the perimeter of the project. http://lisboaenova.org/en/cartasolarlisboa\nThis information will be integrated in the urban requalification plan, in order to promote the\nintegration of solar systems in the renovation process of buildings, in accordance with the cultural\npatrimony requisites. The assessment of potential will be accompanied by an Integration Manual,\ndo be developed in accordance with the solutions currently existing in the market and the\nrelevant criteria for the integration of such systems in classified buildings.\nSUPERVISION OF THE STOThe supervision is a key question when a STO is introduced: the laws can be well made but will\nnot have impact until a well defined and balanced MV&E regime is in place. Supervision means\nalso the appropriate monitoring of the STO impact. Without an impact monitoring it is not\npossible to compare the real results with the targets established in the preparation phase.\nThere are many indicators that should be considered when defining the MV&E of the STO. At\nleast, the following two categories of indicators are essential:\n\uf0b7 The values relative to buildings\no Number of buildings in the scope of the STO (also interesting to be defined in\nterms of m2 of useful pavement surface and, or, number of persons); to be\ncompared with\no Number of buildings in the scope but exempted of the STO\u00a0\u00a0\no Values of the real over\u2010cost in new buildings or buildings rehabilitated; infer\nabout the reasonableness of this value\u00a0\u00a0\no Number of cases where the minimum solar water heating requirements (e.g.,\nsolar fraction) was evidently surpassed\n\uf0b7 The values relative to verifications\no Number of people in the administrating authority of the STO that received\ntraining to perform verifications in the scope of the STO\no Percentage of negative verifications in the SWH system design phase\no Number of random verifications (or inspections) in the installation phase and the\npercentage of negative situations\no Number of random verifications (or inspections) in the operation phase and the\npercentage of negative situations\no Number of sanctioned situations (and type, i.e., severity of non\u2010compliance) and\nrate of execution (payment of the fine)\nAn enforcement strategy is a set of responses to incidents of non\u2010compliance, coupled with a\nprogressive action plan for their application that should include a range of elevating enforcement\nresponses that can be implemented depending on:\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 The severity of the non\u2010compliance;\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 The range of sanctions that are available;\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 The type of programme (i.e. whether it is mandatory or voluntary);\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 The quality of the evidence supporting the claim of non\u2010compliance;\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 The responsiveness of the party responsible for the non\u2010compliance;\u00a0\u00a0\n\uf0b7 The potential to rectify non\u2010compliance.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf compliance is enforced, participants will be encouraged to comply when the potential costs,\nwhether financial or to the participant\u2019s reputation, are greater than the benefits. Similarly, if\nprogramme participants consider that there is only a small chance of a transgression being\ndiscovered and that the associated penalty is also low, there will be little motivation to comply.\u00a0\u00a0\nEnforcement, including remediation, is most effective when action is timely, i.e. responding to the\ndetection of transgressions without undue delay. Enforcement processes with a limited range ofpossible responses tend to be unwieldy and often require high levels of \u201cproof\u201d, which make\nthem impractical in dealing with minor transgressions. A wider range of sanctions allows the\nenforcement authority to respond more quickly, is less costly, and more effective.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhere sanctions are necessary, they should be sufficient to outweigh the benefits of non\u2010\ncompliance in order to be an effective deterrent.\n"}
