The renewable energy share in Albania is predominantly hydropower of \nwhich accounts for 95% of all generating capacity, with the remaining divided between solar (1%) and crude oil \n(4%). The remaining share of supply comes from imports making Albania a net energy importer and thus heavily \nreliant on imports. Being also heavily reliant on hydropower also means that renewable generation is sensitive to \nrainfall, of which has seen considerable annual variations and a steady decline in recent years. This is likely to \nfurther decline with the effects of climate change. In addition to hydropower resources, Albania also has \nabundant solar and wind resources, which are currently almost entirely untapped.\nIn order to improve energy security and climate resilience and to meet growing energy demand, it is imperative \nthat Albania accelerates the transition to those abundant, available and local, renewable energy sources. \n#Renewable Energy Potential\nWithin Europe, Albania has some of the highest sunshine hours per year, representing significant potential for \nsolar energy development. The coastal south and far north of the country also hold immense potential for wind \npower development. Both solar and wind could effectively complement the existent hydropower fleet.\n#Policy Landscape and Targets\n\uf06e The current National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) sets a target of 38% for the renewable energy \nshare of total final energy consumption (TFEC) by 2020.;\n\uf06e The NREAP also stipulates technology-specific deployment targets to achieve this goal: 7MW hydropower, \n490MW solar PV, 50MW wind and 41MW waste-to-power by 2020, which have not yet been reached.;\n\uf06e The National Energy Sector Strategy (2018) formulates a target of 42% of renewable energy in the TPES by 2030 \nwhich has already been achieved.;\n\uf06e A National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) is under development and will set out renewable energy targets up \nuntil 2030.;\n#Support for Renewable Energy\n\uf06e Small-scale renewable assets in Albania are eligible for feed-in-tariffs guaranteed through the obligatory \npurchase of energy by the distribution system operator (DSO).;\n\uf06e Utility-sale projects are auctioned and financed through a Contract for Differences (CfD) scheme. Albania was \none of the first countries in the South-East European region to introduce auctions for renewable energy\nprojects and has since successfully tendered PV projects at competitive prices.;\n\uf06e Net-metering is eligible for small to medium-size solar and wind systems of up to 500 kW.;\n\uf06e Certain customs duty exemptions apply for machinery and equipment used in the construction of all power \nplants, including both renewable and conventional power plants.;\n#Core Challenges for the integration of further renewable capacity\n#Strengthening the distribution network\nPower generation from renewable energy sources fluctuates and is naturally variable. This requires more \nsophisticated network infrastructure and operation that can handle bidirectional energy flows and changing \nsupply profiles. Particularly in high-demand centres such as the capital Tirana, the Albanian distribution grid \nlacks sufficient capacity and dynamic operation to handle variable electricity injection. This severely hampers \nthe successful integration of renewable energy sources in the country.\n#Improving support mechanisms for renewable energy \nWhile minimizing land use and enabling prosumer schemes, small-scale renewable energy projects such as \nrooftop PV are often less cost-effective than utility-scale wind or solar PV parks. Considering this, a revision of the \nexisting support landscape for RE in Albania would foster the deployment of small-scale projects in the country.\n#Ensuring bankability of project proposals\nRenewable Energy investments are relatively capital intensive and require long time frames to amortize costs, \nwhich are almost exclusively based on energy prices. Although the technology is well developed, long time \nframes and uncertain market conditions result in relatively high investment risks. Further de-risking of renewable energy projects would entice private investment and accelerate development. Thoroughly developed planning \nand financial instruments such as Power Purchase Agreements, for example, would inspire confidence and\nstimulate international investment in renewable energy in Albania.\n#Key Actors in the Albanian Energy Sector\n\uf06e Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (MIE) for Strategic development of energy sector, including policy development;\n\uf06e National Agency of Natural Resources (AKBN) for Monitors economic activities that deal with natural resources;\n\uf06e Energy Efficiency Agency Policy for development, energy auditing, implementation of energy efficiency programmes;\n\uf06e Ministry of Tourism and Environment Environmental for protection, coordination of national climate change mitigation;\n\uf06e National Environmental Agency Environmental for impact assessments of power projects, inter alia;\n\uf06e Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Water Administration responsible for water use permits for hydropower projects, inter alia;\n\uf06e Energy Regulatory Authority (ERE) as Regulator of electricity and gas markets;\n\uf06e Transmission System Operator (OST) as Operator of the high-voltage transmission system network;\n\uf06e Electricity Distribution System Operator (OSHEE) as Operator of the low-medium voltage distribution system network;\n\uf06e Albania Power Exchange (ALPEX) as Market operator of Day-Ahead and Intra-Day markets in Albania and Kosovo;\n\uf06e Albanian Power Corporation (KESH) as public electricity supplier (currently subject to liberalisation);\n\uf06e Albania Energy Association represents the interests of Albanian and international energy producers;\n\uf06e Albanian Renewable Energy Association (AREA) represents the interests of renewable energy producers in Albania;\n#Upcoming Hard Talk on the uptake of renewables in Albania\nAs part of the UNECE RE-Uptake Project 2021, a \u201cHard Talk\u201d on the uptake, integration & harmonisation of \nrenewables in Albania will be held with members of the Albanian and international energy community on July 6th\nand 7th, 2021.
