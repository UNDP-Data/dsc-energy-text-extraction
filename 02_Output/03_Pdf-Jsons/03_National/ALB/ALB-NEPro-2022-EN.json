tonnes of carbon Sources: IRENA statistics, plus\ndata from the following sources: UN SDG Database (original sources: WHO; World\nBank; IEA; IRENA; and UNSD); UN World Population Prospects; UNSD Energy\nBalances; UN COMTRADE; World Bank World Development Indicators; EDGAR; REN21\nGlobal Status Report; IEA -IRENA Joint Policies and Measures Database; IRENA\nGlobal Atlas; and World Bank Global Solar Atlas and Global Wind Atlas Additional\nnotes: Capacity per capita and public investments SDGs only apply to developing\nareas Energy self-sufficiency has been defined as total primary energy\nproduction divided by total primary energy supply Energy trade includes all\ncommodities in Chapter 27 of the Harmonised System (HS) Capacity utilisation is\ncalculated as annual generation divided by year-end capacity  ,760h/year Avoided\nemissions from renewable power is calculated as renewable generation divided by\nfossil fuel generation multiplied by reported emissions from the power sector\nThis assumes that, if renewable power did not exist, fossil fuels would be used\nin its place to generate the same amount of power and using the same mix of\nfossil fuels In countries and years where no fossil fuel generation occurs, an\naverage fossil fuel emission factor has been used to calculate the avoided\nemissions These profiles have been produced to provide an overview of\ndevelopments in renewable energy in different countries and areas The IRENA\nstatistics team would welcome comments and feedback on its structure and\ncontent, which can be sent to statistics@irenaorg Last updated on: 8th August,\n2023 IRENA Headquarters Masdar City  Box 236, Abu Dhabi United Arab Emirates"}
