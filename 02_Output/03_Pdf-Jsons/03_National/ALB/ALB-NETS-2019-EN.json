EE interventions in the region Georgia \uf0b7 Since 2018: policy reform program to structure the electricity market in accordance with the EU directives, and develop the regulatory framework for renewable energies and energy efficiency \uf0b7 AFD support: multi-year program of Policy Based Loans to Georgia, with co- financing from KfW and grant support from the European Union. Total AFD funding is 355M\u20ac (2018-2021) \uf0b7 The reform should strengthen Georgia economy and embark in an energy transition in full compliance with the Paris Agreement. The program pays a particular attention to the promotion of energy efficiency both on the supply and demand side. It is critical to promote market efficiency but also to mitigate the impact of tariffs increase on vulnerable customers. \uf0b7 Concretely \uf0b7 \uf0b7 the program facilitated the adoption of energy efficiency and energy efficiency labelling laws in compliance with EU directives. In the coming months, Georgian authorities should adopt the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) as well as several secondary acts to operationalize the reforms. AFD Group 11 EE interventions in the region Albania \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7 Since 2019: Policy-Based Loan in cofinancing with KfW to support energy sector reform, in line with EU Acquis. Total AFD financing: EUR 100M. EUR 1.5M Technical Assistance Package, to support reform. Includes: capacity-building program for the Energy Efficiency Agency (EEA), to improve structure, organization, performance and knowledge of the agency. \uf0b7 Upcoming PEEB Cool: Albania to be included in PEEB Cool, with funding dedicated (loans + grants) to EE improvement of public buildings. AFD Group 12 EE interventions in the region Moldova \uf0b7 \uf0b7 Latest addition to AFD\u2019s geographical scope: July 2021 EE identified as key priority by the new government, to increase energy security by reducing energy consumption \uf0b7 A programme for rehabilitation of public buildings is currently under finalisation with support from EBRD, EIB and the EU, for 75 MEUR. Loan and grant agreements under this project expected to be signed by end- 2021, with implementation to start shortly after. \uf0b7 GoM request for AFD to provide complementary funding for this programme \uf0b7 AFD to assess possibility to provide loan + grant package to accelerate rate of EE renovation of buildings AFD Group 13 THANK YOU ! 2019 TOWARDS A WORLD IN COMMON AFD Group 14 "}
