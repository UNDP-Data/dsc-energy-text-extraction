UNDP within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework\n1. Albania, with its population of 2.9 million, is an upper-middle-income country with a \nhigh Human Development Index of 0.791,\nGender Development Index of 0.967 and Gender \nInequality Index of 0.181. Women hold half of senior government positions. The economy \nis stable but underperforming, dependent on consumption and remittances, with low \nproductivity and a limited tax base. Unemployment is structural and long-term at 11.8 per\ncent with a gender pay gap of 6.6 per cent.\nAccording to official figures, 38.3 per cent of \nthe population suffer severe material deprivations and 23.4 per cent are at risk of falling into \npoverty (2018).\n2. Albania faces multiple challenges that drive vulnerabilities, including weaknesses in \nrule of law, uneven institutional capacity, service gaps, limited investments in social services,\ndegradation of natural resources and few labour opportunities. \n3. The November 2019 earthquake and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic\nhighlighted the need to address disaster risk management and the socioeconomic impact of \nthese events, particularly on vulnerable groups and micro, small and medium-sized\nenterprises. The pandemic deepened gender inequalities, disproportionately affecting \nwomen, their livelihoods and access to essential health services, and increased incidents of \ngender-based violence.\n4. In March 2020, the European Union opened accession negotiations. The country\u2019s \nvision of sustainable development, the key drivers for reforms and political and public \npriorities, are accession to the European Union, sustainable economic growth and inclusive \nprosperity. The National Strategy for Development and Integration (NSDI) III is under \npreparation with interim nationalized Sustainable Development Goal indicators and targets.\n5. This country programme reflects the comparative advantages of UNDP in supporting \nnational reforms and upholding values of justice, human rights, equity and gender equality,\nthrough coordinated multisectoral approaches that facilitate systemic reforms. Drawing on \nits reputation as a United Nations system \u201cintegrator\u201d for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment and trusted impartial partner, UNDP will continue to liaise with the \nGovernment, donors and international institutions to mobilize financing to support economic \ntransformation and eradication of multidimensional poverty; and establish systems that \naddress risks, disasters and social injustice within the Sustainable Development Goals. Work \nat the local level and partnerships within the United Nations and across society position \nUNDP well to support aspirations to join the European Union and attain the outcomes of the \nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF).\n6. The summary7 of the previous country programme\u2019s performance concluded that \nUNDP support to development remains highly relevant in Albania. It is viewed as an \ninnovative thought leader drawing on international experiences, with the ability to convene \ndifferent stakeholders underpinning its integrator role for the 2030 Agenda through: \n(a) technical expertise, offering integrated and cross-sectoral solutions, combining policy and \nregulatory advice with capacity development; (b) a strong and agile operational presence; \n(c) established multi-stakeholder partnerships on priorities for European Union accession \nand the Sustainable Development Goals; and (d) trusted relations with all institutions.\n7 UNDP Albania country programme performance summary 2017-2021. The theory of change underpinning the country programme is that innovative \napproaches to inclusive, climate-friendly, gender-sensitive, sustainable growth in new \ncompetitive sectors, coupled with transparent, accountable governance systems, will boost \njobs and businesses, identify investment opportunities, increase resilience and address \ninterconnected vulnerabilities of climate, health and social injustice. UNDP will focus on \nlocal-level actions that together with national datasets and research, will inform national \nstrategies and build forward better, particularly for those left behind.\n8. Those left behind include women, children from low-income households, single parent \nhouseholds, persons with disabilities, the Roma and Egyptian communities, refugees, \nmigrants, isolated rural communities, the elderly and bisexual, transgender, queer and \nintersex persons. Women who work in the care economy and in addition belong to minority \ngroups and lack education, are the most vulnerable. Discrimination, stigmatization and \ngender-based violence are prevalent. Through a portfolio approach, UNDP will target these \ngroups and increase social cohesion and social protection, in partnership with national and \nlocal governments, United Nations agencies and civil society. UNDP will partner with \nUnited Nations agencies on joint programmes related to leaving no one behind, strategic \npolicy options for Sustainable Development Goal financing and ending violence against \nwomen.\n9. The UNDP integration offer includes innovation, thematic expertise and financing for\nrenewables and energy efficiency in line with Government\u2019s plans to provide safe, affordable \nand clean energy to citizens; and for raising the national ambitions to combat climate change \nand increase resilience to natural and human-induced risks. UNDP will promote nature-based \nsolutions to climate change adaptation and mitigation, not only tackling the climate crisis, \ninequality, poverty and food insecurity, but also providing incentives for new jobs in the \nmaritime, blue and eco-circular economies. Partnering with United Nations agencies, UNDP \nwill implement programmes on a green circular economy and sustainable economic \ndevelopment. \n10. Economic growth is too low to converge with European Union living standards and \nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals. With United Nations agencies, UNDP will \nsupport employment measures for vulnerable groups, integrate small and medium-sized \nenterprises in global value chains, and support civil society to increase women\u2019s access to \ncareers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. There are few incentives for \nadoption and innovation in digital technology, but a national digital data strategy and \nincreasing digitalization are critical to accelerating the fourth industrial revolution. UNDP \nwill focus on integrated solutions that address cross-cutting problems, i.e., identifying nature\u0002based solutions that support the transition to a clean green economy, promote ecotourism and \ncreate new jobs in competitive sectors within the Western Balkan Regional Economic Area.\n11. Key barriers to effective and efficient provision of services and that impact public trust \nare the lack of integrity and accountability of public institutions, slow progress on judicial \nreforms and corruption. Building on previous successes, UNDP will work with civil society \nand the government to improve human capacities and data systems for performance, \ntransparency and planning. UNDP will work on the quality of services and rule of law, in \nclose collaboration with United Nations partners.\n12. With Albania positioning itself as a unifying actor for regional cooperation, security\nand stability, and taking the initial steps to establish the national disaster risk management \nsystem as a requirement to join the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism, UNDP will \ncontinue to promote knowledge-sharing and relevant practices across the subregion. To the \nextent possible, UNDP will promote South-South and triangular cooperation in support of \nthese efforts.\n13. The report of the United Nations mainstreaming, acceleration and policy support \nmission to Albania and the United Nations country team reached consensus on three highly \neffective solutions for policy and programming to accelerate progress towards European \nUnion accession and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals: (a) human capital \ndevelopment and social inclusion; (b) sustainable, resilient and green economic growth and \nresource management; (c) effective, people-centred governance, human rights, rule of law \nand gender equality. These are translated into four UNSDCF outcomes, fully adopted by \nUNDP and underpinned by five cross-cutting principles of human rights; gender equality;\ninclusion and equality; transparent civic participation; and innovation.\n14. The vision, value proposition and theory of change, which consolidates a number of \npast programmatic investments and proposes new transformative areas of action, were \ndeveloped in consultation with over 200 partners representing civil society, private sector, \nacademia, local and national governments, development partners and United Nations\nagencies, and validated in a meeting with over 17 Deputy Ministers. \n#II. Programme priorities and partnerships \n15. This country programme reflects the country\u2019s development priorities as articulated in \nthe NSDI and the UNSDCF 2022-2026. In addition, it is aligned with the UNDP Strategic \nPlan and contributes to different European Union acquis chapters.\nThe Sustainable Development Goal targets and indicators and national datasets are integral to programme\noutcomes and outputs. UNDP will contribute to these priorities, and application of its six \nsignature solutions will help the country accelerate structural transformations. Specifically, \nUNDP will assist the country in the three main areas described below.\n16. Human capital development and social inclusion. Albania needs well-functioning,\nfully operational and funded social inclusion and protection policies. UNDP will work with \nnational partners to promote social cohesion and strengthen social protection systems, \nservices and financing mechanisms to increase coverage and quality for vulnerable groups.\nWith United Nations agencies, UNDP will ensure civic engagement and capacities for \ndialogue and implementation of social care plans. \n17. COVID-19 generated a sense of urgency to operationalize national policies, strengthen \nlocal government capacities and design and fund inclusive, gender-responsive and evidence\u0002based services. To reach those most left behind, UNDP will expand services at municipal \nand national levels in education, health, social care, employment, vocational training and \nhousing. UNDP, with the European Union, will continue investments in the education sector\naffected by the 2019 earthquake, adopting European Union standards and expanding \ninformation and communication technology measures as a post-COVID-19 recovery \nstrategy. UNDP will technically lead implementation of the United Nations COVID-19 \nsocioeconomic recovery plan.\n18. Sustainable, resilient and green economic growth and resource management.\nUNDP will support policies that accelerate an inclusive, productive and sustainable \neconomy, enhance climate resilience and adaptation planning, and transition into a clean \ngreen economy, in line with the Government\u2019s national strategies. This will be done through:\n(a) strengthening governance mechanisms to address climate change, biodiversity loss, \npollution and land degradation; (b) promoting ecotourism and circular bioeconomy;\n(c) promote a \u201csource-to-sea\u201d approach, and strengthen transboundary cooperation for water \nresources management in the Drini River Basin; (d) address the skills mismatch of youth and \nwomen for innovation and digitalization; and (e) support value chains of micro, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, decent jobs and inclusive employment, particularly for persons \nwith disabilities and women. UNDP will support industries to become more energy-efficient,\nincrease the potential of the forestry sector for removal of greenhouse gasses, and support \nthe country\u2019s green growth trajectory. UNDP will support promotion of nature-based tourism \nthat sustains livelihoods and protected areas, while improving ecosystem services and \nfinancial sustainability.\n19. UNDP will support entities to have improved systems and capacities to design and \nimplement innovative policies, particularly in relation to qualitative skills development that \npromotes a digital economy, entrepreneurship and competitive green businesses. UNDP will \nfocus on integrated multisectoral solutions that provide: the necessary skills, vocational \neducation and training; access to decent jobs and innovative technology; sustainable \nlivelihoods; and business opportunities. With young people (aged 15-24) comprising 25 per \ncent of the population, UNDP will continue to promote youth as productive human capital \nand partner with labour-market stakeholders to boost employment and entrepreneurship. \nUNDP will consolidate reforms, strengthen capacities, address skills mismatch and increase \nlabour force participation especially for women and young people, persons with disabilities, \nRoma and Egyptian communities and the long-term unemployed. \n20. With inclusive growth being a key driver for reducing vulnerability and building \nresilience, particularly for the poor and most disadvantaged, UNDP will continue to support \npolicies and measures leading to an expedited economic recovery and increased \ncompetitiveness and productivity of (female-led) micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. \nUNDP will work towards improved environments for digital innovation through support for \ndata-driven innovations, bringing higher education closer to the labour market and \nsupporting new course curricula for future skills. Increasing vocational education and \ntraining to match labour market demands and integrating small and medium-sized enterprises \nin global value chains are additional strategies. A vision and road maps for green growth and \na blue economy will be formulated, thus ensuring growth that protects natural resources.\n21. To contribute to a strengthened risk and disaster management system, UNDP will assist \nthe Government in driving policies and actions that focus on prevention and reduction of \ndisaster-related risks, increasing resilience of infrastructures, ecosystems and society, and \nenabling adaptive capacities, all as a means to reduce the long-term vulnerability of the \npopulation and protect development investments, particularly in at-risk areas. With a \n\u201cknowing better, losing less\u201d approach, UNDP will focus on local-level risk assessments, \nutilizing data and knowledge in parallel with prevention measures. Raising the national \nambition to combat climate change, increasing resilience to natural and human-induced risk, \nand gender-responsive disaster strategies remain priorities.\n22. Effective, people-centred governance, human rights, rule of law and gender \nequality. UNDP will broaden partnerships for a stronger good governance framework, in \nline with the National Public Administration Reform Strategy. UNDP will foster a citizen\u0002centred, gender-sensitive, inclusive approach, while further developing institutional\ncapacities in policymaking and implementation, promoting a culture of participation and \ndialogue for development, and increasing transparency, integrity and accountability. Based \non its initial successful experiences in rolling out integrity planning in municipalities, UNDP \nwill build national capacities to bring to scale and monitor this initiative.\n23. Innovation and digitalization will be explored to establish robust, modernized and \nefficient service delivery. UNDP will support integrated citizen-centred services and further \nexpand municipal one-stop-shop networks to reach remote, mostly rural areas. \n24. UNDP will support legal, policy and institutional reforms related to human rights \ncommitments and civic engagement; capacity development for policymaking and \nmonitoring; and access to justice for vulnerable people. UNDP will continue to support the \nPeople\u2019s Advocate, and the Commissioners for Information and Data Protection and \nProtection from Discrimination. UNDP will continue to work towards ending all forms of \ndomestic, sexual and gender-based violence and unfavourable social norms and gender \nstereotypes, supporting coordinated referral mechanisms and integrated services, safe \naccommodation and accessible emergency and specialized support. It will continue to support the Government to address structural and systemic barriers to gender equality and \nwomen\u2019s empowerment in policy formulation and implementation, and to generate quality \ngender-disaggregated data for targeted, informed investments and quantifying of results.\n25. The programme will support data availability and a more data-driven culture for\nstrengthened sectoral analysis, evidence-based policymaking and promotion of a culture of \naccountability and performance assessment. Policy analysis and formulation will include a \ngender equality focus and gender-disaggregated data. UNDP will engage gender champions \nand support increased civic engagement and dialogue platforms.\n26. UNDP will continue to work closely with existing donors, vertical funds and United \nNations agencies, diversifying funding sources by partnering with new donors including on\nan integrated national finance framework, while broadening engagement with the private \nsector, academia, civil society, national human rights institutions and the media.\n#III. Programme and risk management\n27. This country programme document (CPD) outlines UNDP\u2019s contributions to national \nresults and serves as the primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board for results \nalignment and resources assigned to the programme at country level. Accountabilities of \nmanagers at the country, regional and headquarter levels with respect to country programmes \nare prescribed in the organization\u2019s programme and operations policies and procedures and \ninternal control framework.\n28. The programme will be nationally executed. If necessary, national execution may be \nreplaced by direct execution for part or all of the programme to enable response to force \nmajeure. The harmonized approach to cash transfers will be used in a coordinated fashion \nwith other United Nations agencies to manage financial risks. Cost definitions and \nclassifications for programme and development effectiveness will be charged to the \nconcerned projects.\n29. UNDP will participate in joint Government\u2013United Nations coordination mechanisms. \nProgramme and project boards will be established in line with the social and environmental \nstandards and accountability mechanism. \n30. The main risk to the programme relates to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and an \nunforeseen impact on the capacity to implement the programme or achieve its results.\nPossible changes in the process and requirements for European Union accession may impact \nnational development policies. Natural or man-made hazards, with insufficient institutional \nand local preparedness to respond, can impact the ability of UNDP to support Albania in \ndelivering its development priorities.\n31. Risks will be managed through coordination and partnerships; advocacy and policy \ndialogue; regular monitoring of risks, project and results; and updating of contingency plans \nfor the country office and national emergencies.\n#IV. Monitoring and evaluation\n32. The monitoring and evaluation plan will be implemented following endorsement of the \nCPD by the Executive Board. The results framework is aligned with indicators related to \nEuropean Union accession, the NSDI and the national indicator framework for the \nSustainable Development Goals. This demonstrates a clear linkage between the support \nprovided by UNDP, the programme outcomes and sustainable development results.\n33. The planned evaluations will contribute to accountability, learning and achievement of \nstrategic results. They meet all the required criteria, provide sufficient and balanced coverage \nof the programme\u2019s areas of engagement and emphasize national ownership and capacity \ndevelopment. Planned project evaluations relate to ongoing projects. Results of new projects\nwill be captured in the midterm review or in future project evaluations added during yearly reviews of the evaluation plan. Socioeconomic, political and environmental risks were \nconsidered during the formulation of the evaluation plan. Ethical practices and lessons \nlearned shape policy advice, advocacy and project design and implementation. An \nindependent country programme evaluation will be conducted in 2025.\n34. UNDP will employ national monitoring systems, official statistical data and reports \nfrom line ministries, development partners and research institutions to measure its \ncontribution to national results. Other data, perception surveys and reports will be used to \nassess results and behavioural change. The National Statistical Office and other partners will \nreceive support to continue improving data quality. Data for baselines and targets will be \ndisaggregated by sex, geography and income and increasingly identify those left behind. The \nprogramme will reinforce innovative tools to manage data collection and analysis at the \ncountry programme outcome and output levels."}
