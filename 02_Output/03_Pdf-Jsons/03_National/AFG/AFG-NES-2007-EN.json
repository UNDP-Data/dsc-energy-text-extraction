DEVELOPMENT\nSTRATEGY (ANDS) In the name of Allah, the most Merciful, the most Compassionate\nSix and half years ago, the people of Afghanistan and the international\ncommunity joined hands to liberate Afghanistan from the grip of international\nterrorism and begin the journey to rebuild  nation stunned by  long past of\nviolence, destruction and terror We have come  long way in this shared journey\nIn just  few years, as  result of the partnership between Afghanistan and the\ninternational community, we were able to draw up  new, Constitution, embracing\nthe values of democracy, freedom of speech and equal rights for women Afghans\nvoted in their first ever presidential elections and elected  new parliament\nClose to five million Afghan refugees have returned home, making it one of the\nlargest movement of people to their homeland in history Thousands of schools\nhave been built; over six million boys and girls have been enrolled, the highest\nlevel ever for Afghanistan Hundreds of health clinics have been established\nboosting our basic health coverage from  percent six years ago to over 85\npercent today Access to diagnostic and curative services has increased from\nalmost none in 2002 to more than forty percent now We have rehabilitated 12,200\nkm of roads Our rapid economic growth, with double digit growth almost every\nyear, has led to higher income and better living conditions for our people With\ndeveloping network of roads and  state-of- the-art communications\ninfrastructure, Afghanistan is better placed to serve as an economic land-bridge\nin our region These achievements would not have been possible without the\nunwavering support of the international community and the strong determination\nof the Afghan people  hasten to point out that our achievements should not make\nus complacent distracting to face the enormity of the tasks that are still ahead\nThe threat of terrorism and the menace of narcotics are still affecting\nAfghanistan and the broader region and hampering our development Our progress is\nstill undermined by the betrayal of public trust by some functionaries of the\nstate and uncoordinated and inefficient aid delivery mechanisms Strengthening\nnational and sub-national governance and rebuilding our judiciary are also among\nour most difficult tasks To meet these challenges,  am pleased to present\nAfghanistan\u2019 National Development Strategy (ANDS) This strategy has been\ncompleted after two years of hard work and extensive consultations around the\ncountry As an Afghan-owned blueprint for the development of Afghanistan in all\nspheres of human endeavor, the ANDS will serve as our nation\u2019 Poverty Reduction\nStrategy Paper  am confident that the ANDS will help us in achieving the\nAfghanistan Compact benchmarks and Millennium Development Goals  also consider\nthis document as our roadmap for the long-desired objective of Afghanization, as\nwe transition towards less reliance on aid and an increase in self- sustaining\neconomic growth  thank the international community for their invaluable support\nWith this Afghan-owned strategy,  ask all of our partners to fully support our\nnational development efforts  am strongly encouraged to see the participation of\nthe Afghan people and appreciate the efforts of all those in the international\ncommunity and Afghan society who have contributed to the development of this\nstrategy Finally,  thank the members of the Oversight Committee and the ANDS\nSecretariat for the preparation of this document Hamid Karzai President of

AFGHANISTAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY\n(ANDS) In the name of Allah, the most Merciful, the most Compassionate We are\npleased to present the Afghanistan National Development Strategy, which reflects\nthe commitment of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to poverty reduction and\nprivate sector-led economic growth for  prosperous and stable Afghanistan The\nANDS Oversight Committee (OSC) was mandated by the Government to produce\nMillennium Development Goals-based national strategy that is Afghan-owned and\nmeets the requirements for  Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper The OSC met on\nregular basis to design, discuss and oversee the development of the strategy,\nincluding the identification of the needs and grievances of the people, and the\nprioritization of resource allocations and actions To embrace \u2018Afghanization\u201d\nand ownership, the OSC facilitated inclusive and extensive consultations both at\nnational and sub-national levels Sustained fiscal support and continuous\nevaluation and monitoring are essential now to meet the challenges ahead related\nto ANDS implementation The democratic aspirations of the Afghan people are high,\nyet financial resources remain limited While much has been accomplished since\n2001, more remains to be done as we move from \u201cCompact to Impact\u201d The Afghan\nGovernment with support from the international community must act decisively,\nstrategically, and with an absolute commitment to the ANDS goals and vision We\nlook forward to working with our government colleagues, civil

Energy, abundantly\nand cost effectively supplied, can be  very sustainable important the in input\ndevelopment of Afghanistan However, energy is no panacea In fact, if it is\nsupplied imprudently, instead being  vehicle for growth, it will pull down the\nGovernment\u2019 development efforts and be  drag on economic growth Capital\ninvestment in energy is rising rapidly attesting to the efforts to the Islamic\nRepublic of Afghanistan (IROA) and the donor community At the same time though,\nthe efficiency of energy operations is not increasing If left unchecked, much of\nthe investment that is being made will be wasted To illustrate this gravity of\nthe problem, the cost of losses has been estimated Because of the state of the\ninfrastructure and the familiar short comings of Government owned and operated\nare enormous Losses in 2005 amounted US$ million energy provision, losses Figure\nAnnual Impact of Poor Commercial Operations and Subsidies The actual cost to the\neconomy is greater! What this highlights is that continuing to operate on\nbusiness as usual basis is unsustainable The number one priority in the energy\nsector must be on operating efficiency: commercialization of DABM, investments\nin transmission and distribution to reduce losses, and, repair and maintenance\nof all power assets Moreover, it is important to focus now on efficient use of\nenergy and the enabling policy, frameworks should address this issue legal and\nregulatory When this is considered against the Afghan Compact Goals, the\nimportance of efficiency becomes even more important By 2010 the number of\nconnections to meet the AC goals will rise by 211 percent while capacity will\nincrease only 194%, assuming that imports go according to plan This means that\nunless there are changes in efficiency, the average kWh consumed per connection\nmust go down This is not  recipe for economic growth Compounding the problem and\nnot included in this analysis are that the demand for power will actually rise\nand that with more connections the cost of un-served energy will rise While it\nis imperative that additional infrastructure be added, it is even more important\nthat the IROA focus on efficiency While much can be done by the Government, the\nreal solution lies in creating and expanding  meaningful role for the private\nsector Realizing that the Afghan economy is starved of reliable and cost\neffective energy, the immediate task of the IROA, with assistance from the Donor\ncommunity, is then to provide energy to those that can use best use and pay for\nit (and that may well be business), in the quantities and quality that they\nneed, at  price that covers cost (for all but the poorest members of society),\nand to do so in the most cost effective manner At the same time though, it must\nbegin to take steps that will provide  solid footing for the transition of the\nsector from Government provision to Private Sector provision This strategy\nacknowledges that there are many steps that need to be taken Executive Summary\non the road to fully involving the private sector It will begin with changes in\npolicy and laws and involvement of the private sector in outsourcing at DABM It\nis  gradual process that will be enhanced by  deliberate process of reform in\nrural energy provision and (IROA) of Afghanistan The availability of secure\nenergy supplies significantly within Afghanistan was disrupted by the conflicts\nof the past two decades Post-conflict efforts by the Islamic Republic and\ninternational donors to date have focused on expanding the availability of\nenergy resources throughout the country Particular emphasis has been on\nexpanding and rehabilitating the electricity sector in the major economic hubs\nof the country and providing basic service in rural areas Efforts also have been\ntaken to improve the supply of natural gas, increase availability of hydro-\nelectric generation, rehabilitate and expand electricity and natural gas\ntransmission and distribution systems, develop renewable energy resources in\nrural and remote areas, increase low-cost power imports and improve the\ncapability of energy sector institutions Since 2001, Afghanistan energy efforts\nhave focused on \u201cbailing out the boat\u201d or keeping the lights on and providing\nheat in the winter At some point, one must also focus on stopping the flow of\nwater before they become exhausted The short term focused activities alone can\ncontinue only so long before the long term growth path of the country is\nadversely Having achieved moderate success in these areas, the time is ripe to\nreview current activities and programs and place greater emphasis on behalf of\nthe IROA and donors on  more long-range, sustainable future for the energy\nsector This would include balancing on-going efforts to rehabilitate and expand\nenergy resources with  longer-term strategy for the sector impacted The Afghan\nEnergy Strategy contains an implicit prioritization of energy sub-sector\nactivities Electricity is given far greater preference or priority than other\nsectors because modern economies are built on electricity Priority is then\nassigned to other sub-sectors based on their supporting role in electricity and\nin overall economic activity In practical terms this means that MoM and to\nprioritize MoCI need their policies, programs and projects towards the\nproduction of fuels for electricity generation The strategy is based on five3\nprongs or pillars  Increased in Efficiency increasing efficiency Existing\nOperation: At this time, it is easier, faster and cheaper to gain  megawatt of\npower from from building  new generating plant For example, for every US $ the\nGovernment spends in providing compact fluorescent light bulbs, it actually\nsaves US $51 and 49 watts than  Improved Sector Governance and Public- Private\nPartnership Promotion1: The ultimate success of the energy sector the depends\ncritically on mobilizing private sector This can begin now with establishing\nmulti-sector regulator, looking to outsource at State Owned Enterprises,\npreparing the enabling legal, policy and regulatory infrastructure for business,\nand the commercialization of SOEs  Improved Coordination and Capacity\nDevelopment: Additionally, coordination among the Government entities must\nincrease and coordination between the Government and the Donor community must\nlikewise be strengthened Assistance needs to be given to ICE to strengthen its\ncapacity An integrated energy master plan is required to serve as  road map for\nthe Government and Donors alike To accomplish capacity must be significantly\nstrengthened and training is an imperative this,  Rural Energy versus Rural\nElectrification: Most rural Afghans are unable to pay for expensive electricity\nEnergy is required for growth but energy alone won\u2019 do the job The role of rural\nenergy to seek out opportunities for economic activities that lack energy, that\nwill pay for energy and energy thereby subsidize rural  Clearly there is overlap\nbetween pillars  and  in some part necessitate Increased efficiency will\nimproved Governance and the ultimate efficiency gains will be possible only with\nprivate provision These commonalities notwithstanding, these two areas are\ndifferent in their major focus  AFGHANISTAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS)\nconsumption while raising rural incomes at the same time  Expanded or New\nSupply: Investments in new capacity or energy infrastructure:  lot of progress\nhas been made, but not enough, in creating new supply It is time now that the\nGovernment and Donor community alternative supplies such as wind energy or\nreducing consumption the more alongside traditional methods New supply must be\nrationalized and efforts focused on  few large projects such as the North East\nPower System consider can These are the pillars of Afghanistan\u2019 near term energy\nstrategy Alongside addressing the immediate and short term needs, it is\nimperative that the country look to longer term issues Because it is building\nits energy infrastructure anew, it can learn from the lessons of experience in\nother countries It can focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy and\ndecentralized energy If it does this at the same time it builds its industrial\nbase, then the benefits are enormous Thus, while  national grid is important to\ntransport power from cheaper markets, it will prove more beneficial in the long\nrun to focus on decentralized power  recent British study concluded that 61\npercent of the energy value of the primary fuel disappears \u201cAnother  percent\nvanished in transmission\u201d This means that roughly two thirds of the energy is\nlost in  centralized system By locating power generation closer to users, these\nlosses can be significantly reduced Thus, the long term strategy will\nincreasingly focus on cogeneration, distributed power, renewable and end-use\nefficiency as well as the more traditional areas The strategy is focused on\npoverty reduction through all its five pillars First, by improving operating\nefficiency, the drain on government resources is reduced More is available for\nother programs Similarly, by focusing on end-use efficiency, the drain on the\ncustomer\u2019 resources is reduced More of their income is available for other\nthings Second, improving sector governance will also have  significant impact on\npoverty It will bring about better subsidy mechanisms so that the subsidy is\ntargeted to those that need it the best way possible While it will reduce the\noverall level of subsidy in the sector but the neediest members of society will\nhave access to energy at subsidized rates Moreover, every Afghani of subsidy\nthat can be freed up in this sector can be used in other sectors Third, this\nstrategy reorients rural energy to focus on income generating activities Thus,\nby definition this is  poverty reduction activity Fourth, the economy is starved\nfor energy The fifth pillar is the investment in new energy supply and the\neconomy can\u2019 grow without energy; poverty in reduced economic growth Afghanistan\nwithout Finally, the combined impact of these policies, programs and projects\nwill be more energy supplied more efficiently and reliably This is  solid\nprescription for economic growth, which growth for poverty reduction important\ncan\u2019 be is Executive Summary   AFGHANISTAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS)\nin input is an important Energy, abundantly and cost effectively supplied, the\nsustainable development of Afghanistan It is  necessary but not sufficient\ncondition for economic growth Energy provided cost effectively in sufficient\nquantity and quality on  sustainable basis will support economic development and\nemployment; help reduce poverty; contribute to social and political stability\nboth within Afghanistan and regionally; living standards; and contribute to\nreduction in environmental impacts Energy alone, though, is no panacea to\nAfghanistan\u2019 problems In fact, if it is supplied

strategy for the\nsector balancing on-going efforts losses energy provision, To illustrate this\ngravity of the problem, the cost of losses has been estimated Because of the\nstate of the infrastructure and the familiar short comings of Government owned\nand are operated enormous Total losses is 40% (Technical 23% and 17% commercial)\nwhere as in  reasonable system they would be on the order of 10% loss of energy\nequates to  This 20% substantial 2005, In financial drain Afghanistan produced\nand imported ,Gwh of power2 If 20% of this is lost, this means MWH and at $12\nper kWh3, the cost of these losses amounts to $million annually To this must be\nadded the cost of subsidies, or $56 million  year Finally, there are commercial\nlosses This covers everything from theft to that the fact that () not all power\nsold is billed and () not all power billed is collected Collections are 60% of\nbilling It can safely be assumes that total losses are 40% (23% technical and\n17% commercial), or mWh for  cost of $million This is dramatically following\nfigure illustrated the in  AEIC website 2005 electricity production  Soucre: MEW\nPower Sector Strategy INTRUDUCTION  The total cost of losses and subsidies\nequaled $million in The actual cost to the economy is greater! What this\nhighlights is that continuing to operate on  business as usual basis is\nunsustainable The number one priority in the energy sector must be on\nefficiency: commercialization of DABM,

specific goals in turn will help By\nend-2010: electricity will reach at least 65% of households and 90% of non-\nresidential establishments in major urban areas and at least 25% of households\nin rural areas; at least 75% of the costs will be recovered from users connected\nto the national power grid  strategy for the development and use of renewable\nenergies will be developed by end-\u201d Economic growth that raises incomes and\nreduces poverty is strongly correlated with increased energy use Energy is used\nin the production process of every sector of the economy The provision of\nadequate and reliable energy services at affordable and cost- based prices, in\nsecure and environmentally sustainable manner, and in conformity with social and\neconomic development needs, is an essential element of sustainable development\nsufficient supply of energy is  vital input for eradicating poverty, improving\nhuman welfare and raising living standards The correlation between commercial\nenergy and development is aptly shown in Figure  where per capita GDP is\nmeasured against per capita energy consumption If Afghanistan is to grow and\ntake its place among industrializing

energy and there is\nstrong direct relationship between per capita GDP and per capita energy\nconsumption Economic growth is not accompanied by declining energy consumption!\nPerhaps the most compelling description of the energy sector in Afghanistan is\nshown in Figure  In 1980, the per capita energy consumption of Afghanistan was\nfourth in the region, greater than that of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh By 2004, per\ncapita from consumption had fallen drastically slightly less than  million BTU\nper person to just around  million BTU This is at  time when all other economies\nin region exhibited jump in strong growth consumption between the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s was due to the export of natural gas to Russia The significant\nReliable energy data for Afghanistan is about as scarce as energy in Afghanistan\nThe data below are from the US Energy Information Administration, the US\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory and other Afghan sources Figure  Per capita\nEnergy Consumption Electricity (hydro and imports) comprises the vast majority\nof energy consumed or about 77% of commercial energy This is followed by coal,\nnatural gas and then petroleum Figure  below

countries like Afghanistan\ntraditional energy represents  major source of energy from an energy Afghanistan\nhas gone exporter, natural gas to the Soviet Union, to where it imports\nsubstantial amount of energy In 2005, over half of the commercial energy\nconsumed came from imports This is energy due infrastructure rather than an in\nconsumption As can be seen, consumption has remained

resources new Energy in\nAfghanistan in recent history can be categorized as  period where supply has\nalways been short of demand, as it has in many similar countries The demand for\nenergy outstrips current supply in every category of energy, traditional is\nunsustainably harvested energy which Much of the deficit in supply can be blamed\non the lack of investment, cannibalization and carnage that has accompanied\nAfghanistan\u2019 civil crises since As civil strife strains financial is abandoned,\nroutine maintenance is postponed; spares are taken from one plant for another;\nskilled human resources that are needed to maintain the capital stock leave; and\nsoon parts are stolen and sold for other uses Sad and unpreventable as this is,\nlarge share of the gap can be blamed on faulty resource allocation policies\nSubsidies, as they are so often carried out, create  vicious downward cycle For\nexample, the electric utility often does not collect enough to pay for operating\ncost let alone capital costs This is because () thirty percent of the energy it\nsupplies is lost, investment losses result, leading technical () some energy\nthat is consumed is not billed, () some energy that is billed is not collected,\nand () the price of energy is below the cost of production When the utility does\nnot collect enough, it begins to let maintenance slip and as  increase;\nconsumers with unreliable service see less reason to pay and so collections are\neven to downward spiral As lower, mentioned earlier, combined losses and\nsubsidies are costing the Government $million annually As can be clearly seen in\nTable , this is unsustainable Given that infrastructure investments are growing\nand increasingly more power is being produced, unless radical changes take\nplace, losses will steadily climb These losses are not only  drain on the power\nsystem They represent resources that could be going to produce more energy or to\nother development needs It is clear that changing this must be  top priority in\nthe electricity sector Table  The Cost of Losses and Subsidies (2005) 12\nAFGHANISTAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS) 2005 (AEIC) Supply

the\nenabling environment for meaningful private sector participation is absent The\nproper place to begin is with the adoption of an overarching energy law and\nredrafting of the sub-sector laws to adequately establish the required enabling\nframeworks The energy sector and its sub-sectors (electric power, coal, oil,\ngas, and renewable energy) expansion are insufficient However, poor budgetary\nresources, lack of trained personnel and weak government policies (including\nnon- inter-ministerial cross-cutting resolution of issues) have complicated and\nin some energy instances

promising long-term resource for power is hydropower, which\naccounts for over 50% of in Afghanistan generation (natural gas and coal) grid-\nconnected installed capacity6 Following hydropower, thermal generation,\nprimarily diesel generation, supplies power mainly to urban areas Utilization of\nindigenous fossil fuels for power generation is very limited as is utilization\nof solar, wind

power\nsystem The cost of generation differs significantly and displacing diesel\ngeneration with other energy sources through  least-cost expansion plan can\nreduce costs significantly Moreover, it excludes the cost of transmission and\ndistribution When this cost is included, extension of the grid may often be more\nexpensive than decentralized generation including many renewables The financial\ncondition of the sector and the utility is going from bad to worse because there\nhas been little improvement in tariffs and operations while at time substantial\nassets have been added to the system Maintaining and operating these is\nexpensive and if the Government does not new shift infrastructure alone to\nefficiently operating and maintaining what is has, the burden on the same\nbuilding focus from its the economy will be enormous So, what Table  clearly\nshows that if DABM wants to expand generation, then there is  rank order based\non cost? Clearly, hydro and imports are preferred to diesel as is natural gas\nHowever, what Table  does not show is the cost of increasing electricity supply\nand this is  more important concept in the case of Afghanistan given both the\nimperatives of cost and time Electricity supply can be increased by increasing\ngeneration, increasing efficiency (reducing technical and commercial losses) and\nby reducing the demand for electricity In the Government subsidizes fact,\nbecause electricity, it actual saves money for every kilowatt hour it can reduce\ndemand while it loses on every kWh that it generates the simple example will\nexplain One importance of concentrating on reducing demand For every compact\nfluorescent light (CFL) bulb used, there is  saving in energy 14 AFGHANISTAN\nNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS) over the standard incandescent bulb If  60W\nbulb is replaced with  14 watt CFL, there is saving of 46 watts Over the life of\nthe bulb, 10,000 hours on average, this is saving of 657 kWh If the bulb costs\nUS$ , then the cost of freeing up  kWh is US subsidy amounts to  US cents per\nkWh or one third that of hydro and it takes far less time to do this If the\nsubsidy is considered, then the Government actual saves money by helping\nconsumers to be more efficient For every US$  the Government spends (on  new\nCFL), it reduces the amount it spends on the subsidy by US$ This can be seen in\nFigure  Figure  Cost of Supply  Petroleum According to geological studies\nalready made, considerable resources of gas/petroleum existed in Afghanistan and\ndue to the last

electricity may well be their next choice of service In\nrural-remote Afghanistan, if Afghans are similar to the peoples of the region,\nthen access to electricity will not be their most urgent priority Additionally,\nexperience the world over has provided an important lesson with regard to\nblindly providing access to electricity There is no guarantee that increased\naccess to electricity will bring economic benefits Simply look around in Kabul\nand other urban areas where residential access has increased If access to\nelectricity is not targeted to or coupled with income generating activities,\nthen rural access brings lighting and little else  DEMAND Although there is\nlittle data for Afghanistan on rural energy use, inferences can be drawn from\nsimilar countries in the region There is  tendency to assume that grid connected\nelectricity offers the best form of energy for rural populations Experience\nthroughout the world has shown that there is  progression in the use of energy\nDue to the dispersed nature of the rural population, renewable energy offers the\nbest solution for electrification for the majority of Afghanistan\u2019 rural\npopulation to that currently does not have access 15 According to their survey,\n49% of rural respondents had access to electricity and 89% of urban respondents\nhad access Their sample was not representative of the country with regard to\nenergy access In part, what they call rural actually represents sizable\npopulation centers Moreover, their question did not ask if access to energy was\nan issue but rather the extent to which energy is  problem 16 The distinction\nbetween rural and urban in Afghanistan also causes blurring of responsibilities\nbetween MEW and MRRD and so we use the term rural-remote to denote those

present\ntime, with support from the ADB and the World Bank, the four countries of\nTajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and Pakistan are actively exploring\nconstruction of  high tension line that would transmit 1300 MW of power from\nCentral Asia through Afghanistan to Pakistan, with Pakistan receiving ,000 MW,\nand Afghanistan gaining 300 MW Construction of such  project would

comprising three pillars: Reduce energy demand to the lowest\nrate possible; supply the energy that is required from sustainable resources;\nand, where fossil energy is required, use it as efficiently as possible Although\nAfghanistan has one of the lowest per capita energy consumption rates in the\nworld, that rate is expected to increase to  level comparable to that of\nKazakhstan and Turkmenistan over the next 30 years Energy demand will increase\nas the city grows, so the energy supply must keep pace with the anticipated\ndemand if project momentum is to be achieved and maintained Consequently energy\ngeneration and distribution infrastructure will be  priority in each\nconstruction phase and through is  design Reducing energy demand consideration\nincorporated in every building and system in DehSabz From the use of concrete\ncore activation methods to heat and cool floors walls and ceilings via\ngeothermal sources, to the correct solar orientation of each building, the\ndemand for energy is minimized Energy that is required is generated as much as\npossible sustainable means including hydro-electricity, micro hydro-\nelectricity, passive and active solar generation, biomass combustion, deep\ngeothermal power But, as exciting as the footprints possibilities of zero\necological through sustainable energy production are, there will be gaps in the\nenergy production cycle that will have to be filled by diesel sustainable\ngenerators But technologies can be applied Afghanistan is searching for\nreplacement crops for Opium Poppies so as to ensure sustainable livelihoods in\nrural districts The production of biodiesel for the generators will require\nyield of approximately 42,000 dry Tonnes of oil seed the biodiesel per year\nCombined with even here refuse it requirements of other cities and local rural\nthe requirements production of biomass for fuel could gradually replace poppy\ncultivation in large parts of the nation is conceivable that The energy strategy\nincludes the concept of  robust network, able to withstand the rigors of the\nclimate and the terrain Traditional power networks operate on the concept of\ncentralized production and wide area distribution, making them vulnerable to\nenvironmental effects, system defects and, if the generation capacity is outside\nthe nation, market effects The Dehsabz energy strategy is founded on the\nprinciple of widely distributed and diverse generation, coupled to network\nenabled but localized distribution In effect energy is consumed as close to the\npoint of production as possible, reducing losses in the transmission the expense\nand system while reducing tension engineering required is distribution system\nThe power grid networked however

provide much assistance, there appears to\nbe no clear IROA policy for rural electrification or for promoting private\nsector participation in rural energy projects; also coordination among\nministries and other project participants' needs improvement THE ROLE OF THE\nPRIVATE SECTOR Throughout the world, the role of the private sector in energy is\ngrowing and is significant in most countries In Afghanistan, it is virtually\nnonexistent The roles of the private sector vary from managing government owned\nassets to outright ownership and operation There are examples where all these\nmechanisms coexist in one country There are other examples where countries have\nchosen one model and others where the country transitions over time from the\nsimplest model (management contract) to complete ownership and operation there\nare obstacles in To be sure, Afghanistan to greater private sector involvement,\nprimarily to investment, but some of these obstacles can be overcome or offset\nwith innovative mechanisms The private sector can be called upon to invest\nand/or own manage, operate, energy entities and operations Each different\nmechanism has its advantages and disadvantages Often, there is  progression from\nmanagement through ownership that takes into account the current situation In\nthe electricity sub- sector for example, it is highly unlikely under the current\nsecurity, institutional, policy and legal/regulatory situation that private\ninvestors will be attracted to invest in  large- scale power plant However,\nuntil these issues are resolved, there are many other ways to use the private\nsector Billing can be outsourced The construction arms of DABM could be sold\noff, allowing DABM to focus on core operations Following DABM\u2019\ncommercialization, distribution could be given on  management contract\nIndividual power plants could be given on management contract There are  variety\nof mechanisms available now for the IROA to tap the private sector as it\nprepares the enabling frameworks and other requisite mechanisms to foster full\nprivate sector ownership and operation One of the questions that have been posed\nin this strategy exercise is whether or not DABM (and other SOEs) should be\nunbundled In this context, unbundling has meant the separation of the utility\ninto different the operating units privatization by sale of one or more of those\nunits or ownership unbundling For example, the distribution part of DABM might\nbe separated into several smaller distribution companies and then The sold as\ncould be generation and CURRENT STATE OF THE ENERGY SECTOR 25 the substitutes,\nempirical evidence is mixed and does not strongly support one position or the\nother In fact, many of the earlier proponents of unbundling have now taken  more\nconservative position that the virtues of unbundling depend upon numerous\nfactors such as the size of the market, the availability of cost production and\nthe overall structure and position of the sector within the economy Simply put,\nwhen  country or market are small, unbundling may not achieve the results it\nwill in larger, more mature markets Afghanistan\u2019 market is quite small Ownership\nimmature unbundling is the last stage of  four step process At this time it is\nnot possible because the other steps have not yet begun and and functions within\nimposition To be sure, the commercialization of DABM and other SOEs will require\nsome unbundling The first step is accounting unbundling or the separation of\naccounts Functional functions of different is the unbundling will follow This\nthe separation of company of the restrictions on activities such as physical\nseparation of people, of management, separation of information that competitors\nmay need separation of services that should be regulated from those that are\ncompetitive in nature, etc Functional unbundling can either take place within\nthe same company or be unbundled into Functional company an accounting also\nmeans unbundling unbundling legal there Then unbundling but this \u201cdoes not imply\nchange of ownership of assets and nothing prevents similar or identical\nemployment conditions applying throughout the whole of the vertically integrated\nundertakings However,  non-discriminatory decision- should be ensured making\nprocess measures organizational through independence of the the regarding Legal\ndecision-makers responsible\u201d unbundling will of necessity include accounting and\nfunctional unbundling affiliate is The strategy envisions that with time DABM\nand other energy sector SOEs will go step by step to legal unbundling Some non-\ncore functions will either be outsourced or completely divested, reaching the\nlast step of ownership unbundling The outcome of this strategy exercise is that\nthere are more fundamental reforms required in the laws, rules and regulations\nand at DABM before large scale ownership unbundling should be considered\nCHALLENGES, RISKS AND CONSTRAINTS  number of challenges, constraints and risks,\nboth real and perceived, associated with the ability of the IROA to develop and\nimplement  comprehensive Energy Sector Strategy need to be addressed These\ninclude the following  Private Sector Provision The single most important\nchallenge facing energy is attracting the private sector in  meaningful way The\nsector is plagued by inefficiency and under investment While second best\nmeasures can be put in place, such as the the commercialization of DABM, optimal\nsolution is eventual private sector provision throughout the sector Private\nsector participation in Afghanistan\u2019 energy sector is crucial to achieving the\nlong term objectives of the sector Efforts to attract private investment are\nincorporated within IROA programs and projects, but there is no coordinated\napproach to achieving this goal In particular, options for private participation\nbeyond equipment and supplies and management contracts need to be explored, and\neffective policies put into place The IROA and donors, through the \u201cone-stop\nshop\u201d at the MEW, the Afghanistan Investment Support Agency, or other mechanisms\nneed to address this issue and increase and international investors in the\nenergy sector The constraints facing greater private sector for involvement\nprivate sector investors, lack of  regulatory environment, credit worthiness of\npotential buyer, and general security legal protection opportunities include\nlocal for  Capacity 26 AFGHANISTAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS) few\nPerhaps the single biggest constraint in the sector is the very limited capacity\ngiven the tasks that need to be accomplished Both the Ministries and the SOEs\nare characterized by trained/skilled limited capacity and is levels It personnel\nbelow imperative that basic managerial skills be developed and that training

places in this report, the lack\nof information severely hampers both analysis of current and historical\ninformation and planning While the IROA and Donor strategy has out of necessity\nfocused on immediate needs, the long run health of the sector and the economy\ndepend critically on the collection, dissemination and evaluation of energy\ninformation and its use in planning  Efficiency The second most important\nchallenge facing the energy sector is the efficient operation of SOEs and heavy\nreliance on subsidies to support these SOEs Focus has been on expanding supply\nand major rehabilitation of generation and NEPS The two principal constraints\nhere are () the lack of complete and effective commercialization of SOEs such as\nDABM and () lack of priority given to funding these efforts This is also the\nresult of insufficient capacity  Fuel The cost of fuel to support electricity\ngeneration, especially for Kabul and until NEPS is completed, will be about $100\nmillion/year $25 million/year for SEPS Funding and procurement mechanisms to\nobtain this fuel are not yet established and need to be addressed another and\nImports Prices and availability of power from other CAR countries also are\nuncertain Imported power costs will probably be as much, if not more, than\ncents/kWh or more in 2010 requiring currency annual requirement of $160

AFGHANISTAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS) CHAPTER II ENERGY\nSECTOR STRATEGY ENERGY STRATEGIC VISION \u201cAn Energy sector that provides citizens\nof Afghanistan and drivers of growth in the economy with long-term reliable,\naffordable energy access based on market-based private sector sector oversight\u201d\ninvestment public and Overall Energy Sector Goals (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131)\n(cid:131) Restructured sector governance and cost- recoverable operations\nRehabilitation and expansion of public power grid the The attraction of private\ninvestment in the energy sector Improved rural energy access (cid:131)\nDevelopment of indigenous resources for power and energy use There is  time in\nAfghanistan\u2019 future when energy will be abundant, blackouts will be  thing of\nthe past, and most of its energy needs will be provided directly by the private\nsector Private investors will develop power plants, operate and own distribution\nsystems and develop in situ resources, just as they have begun to do in many\ncountries But that is the distant future For now, Afghanistan must work hard to\nincrease energy production, doing so efficiently and in  cost effective manner\nIt can do this by building new capacity and by improving the efficiency of\nexisting infrastructure, building capacity in its workforce, and its energy\noperations to make them more transparent, increase operating efficiency and\nprepare them for eventual entry into the private sector At the same time though,\nit must begin laying the ground-work for the eventual large-scale participation\nof the private sector reorganizing Above all, this means that development of the\nelectricity sector and the fuels that feed it are the single most important\npriority in the energy sector! India,  country with far greater security, more\nresources,  larger and better trained technical established cadre and  much\nbetter framework commercial for energy and ventures, began serious embarking on\nIPPs in The first IPP,  gas combined cycle by  local company, was commissioned\nin late Many foreign IPP developers such as Enron, Congentrix and AES all\nstarted the IPP process but only  handful finished The bottom line is that\ntoday, 15 years after the IPP is still program started, most generation\nGovernment owned and most IPPs are Indian owned and financed Afghanistan can\nlearn from India\u2019 mistake and their success but can\u2019 expect to have large IPP\nprojects in less time than they did This is not to say that we can\u2019 sector and\nwon\u2019 have private involvement; we must and we will And the time to begin\npreparing for the private sector is now Afghanistan must not only focus on the\nimmediate energy needs but turn attention to the longer run It knows where it is\ngoing and but not necessarily how to get there This strategy will address the\nquestions of where we are going and how we get there What this means for energy\nis that as we continue to focus our efforts on short run options to increase\nsupply25, one must begin developing the foundation that will support long run\nsustainable growth It means stemming the losses at SOEs like DABM, reorganizing\nthem and commercializing them It means investing loss in repair and maintenance\nand in 25 Increasing supply can come about through building new capacity,\nincreasing imports or reducing technical losses ENERGY SECTOR STRATEGY 29\nreduction It means making difficult choices the different among various projects\nof Government entities for the next two to five years It means in some cases\norganizing other Ministries\u2019 projects around electricity supply because this is\nwhat will drive the economy It is imperative that in the near future more\nelectricity be provided to more people in the most expeditious manner possible\nwhile being mindful of the long run economic impact At the same time,\nAfghanistan must be laying the legal, regulatory, commercial and institutional\nfoundations to unleash the power of the are private appropriate sector when\nconditions this reflects In part, Afghanistan does not have an integrated energy\nstrategy Rather, it has  coal strategy, an electric power strategy, and\nhydrocarbons strategy the government\u2019 treatment of energy as separate\ninstitutional and sector silos and, in part, it reflects the lack of\ninstitutional depth to see that energy markets and, perhaps, more importantly,\nthat electricity supply projects are highly intertwined with other sub-sectors\nIn the nature of assistance part activities that focused on keeping the lights\non and the vehicles rolling it reflects for sharing Integrated energy planning\nand policy development are key to  well functioning energy sector But the IROA\nis not yet equipped to develop an integrated strategy, plans or policy analysis\nbecause the basic energy sector data is missing or rudimentary; energy-economic\nmodels do not exist; mechanisms information and collaborating are not in place\nIn short, work must begin on all of these so that better sub sector and\nintegrated energy planning and policy analysis/formulation can take place For\nexample, fundamental gaps in data on energy supply and consumption and the\ndevelopable resource base coupled with uncertainties key developmental\nindicators (economic growth, income, level and structure of energy demand, rates\nof population growth and urbanization) have made development of an effective\nsector strategy, the effectiveness assistance activities, all the more difficult\nincluding of determining short-term forecasts in of To date, the primary focus\nhas been short- term, the rehabilitation of generation and requires such as\ndiesel expansion of energy services using high cost Long-term resources\nsustainability promoting development of energy resources on  least- cost26 basis\nin an environmentally sound and socially acceptable way Now is the time to begin\ndeveloping the tools that will help Afghanistan take  broader more long-term\napproach, to review options, and to look at developing least-cost energy\nresources for meeting Afghanistan Compact goals and objectives This strategy\nincorporates projects that are already in the pipeline but also considers what\npolicies, programs, and projects could be re-evaluated and given  new priority\n(, sector governance) to ensure that they provide results at lowest cost and\nmaximize impacts for  given level of assistance The broad goals for the energy\nsector are: (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) Increased Private Sector\nProvision of Energy Better Sector Governance Increased focusing countries,\ntransmission of energy; Expand the availability of electric power; trade with\nneighboring the on (cid:131) Develop  Master Plan for Rural (cid:131) Energy;\nand, Establish market-based tariffs with  clear timetable to phase out subsidies\nimprove The best strategy at this time is  four paralleled prong approach The\nfirst prong is to existing operations This will be accomplished by physical\ninvestments such as the repair and renovation of existing energy infrastructure\nefficiency of the 26  correct least cost program would define cost in the\neconomic definition of cost and not the financial definition Thus, it would\ninclude the environmental benefits or costs and price externalities In this\nmanner, the least-cost method would produce an economically optimal solution\nHowever, this is rarely ever done and cost takes on  purely private definition\nwith the result that too much fossil is consumed and produced fuel energy\nrelative to other forms of energy and, in general, too much energy is used in\nthe economy 30 AFGHANISTAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS) and the\nprocurement of spares It will involve changes in the operations of energy sector\nSOEs The most important of these is DABM Commercialization of DABM must be fast\ntracked It must operate on  commercial basis with clear targets for loss\nreduction and officers and employees need to be rewarded for increasing\nefficiency and cutting losses and held accountable for performance Aside from\nthe financial implication of continued losses, there are other sound reasons for\nfocusing on this area Adding  megawatt of power through repair and renovation is\nusually quicker and certainly cheaper than building new capacity Progress is\nbeing made on building new capacity but repair and renovation is slower than it\nshould be For example, it is only now, in September 2007, that DABM has begun\nlimited campaign to identify losses Training is urgently required in all areas\nfrom general accounting to advanced power system controls he second prong must\nbe to significantly improve sector governance and begin involving the private\nsector in various aspects of energy until the legal, commercial and security\nclimate is conducive to transfer most aspects of the energy sector to the\nprivate sector27 The single most important governance measure will be the\nestablishment of  multi-sector regulator under the Ministry of Economy Arguments\nare frequently made that the private sector won\u2019 participate or that it should\nnot participate until and unless significant reform and improvements have is\ndifferent been made Afghanistan can begin now by introducing for some aspects,\nmanagement contracts outsourcing others and the case of peripheral operations\nsuch as construction, they can be spun off Small as these measures may be, they\nwill invigorate the sector by tapping private and sector management They will\nallow Government entities to focus on core activities and build  successful in\nprivate sector involvement At the same time though, every effort must be made to\nlay the foundation of track record resources reality The in 27 Clearly there is\noverlap between prongs  and  Increased efficiency will in some part necessitate\nimproved Governance and the ultimate efficiency gains will be possible only with\nprivate provision These commonalities notwithstanding, these two areas are\ndifferent in their major focus enabling laws, policies and regulations that\nunleash the full potential of private sector investment and operation of large\nscale energy facilities THE THIRD PRONG ENERGY ELECTRIFICATION IS RURAL INSTEAD\nOF RURAL  Rural Energy in the Vision mpirical evidence from the developing world\nclearly indicates that household' transition to different forms of energy based\non complex economic, cultural, technical and social relationships People do not\njust go from cooking on firewood to cooking on electricity Additionally, if they\nused  certain amount of lumens or btus in, for example, lighting, they do not\nuse the same amount when moving up from candles to kerosene or from kerosene to\nelectricity The findings discussed earlier lead to several that have profound\nconclusions major implications for rural energy (cid:131) (cid:131) First, given\nthese income levels, some to be electricity services will need subsidized As\nshown above, if rural households were putting all their energy expenditures into\nelectricity, this would mean consumption of kWh per month or enough to run two\n60  electric light bulbs for about  hours per day Second, residential energy use\nwill be very limited and there is  definite transitioning in energy use that\ntakes place The order of use will most likely be lighting, radio, fan, TV, and\nthen an iron or some other small appliance It will be  long time before\nelectricity takes on uses for cooking and heating in rural areas This means\nthat, until incomes rise significantly, only  small portion of energy\nexpenditures will be directed to electricity Rural residential consumers will\nconsume very small amounts of electricity future activities WILL Income\ngenerating require other forms of energy as well as electricity foreseeable the\nfor ENERGY SECTOR STRATEGY 31 (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) the that estimated\nThird, another problem exists because of low income levels and imperfect markets\nEven if consumers were willing and able to afford the full cost electricity per\nkilowatt hour, they certainly could not afford the connection costs This is\ncalled the first cost problem For example, it has been cost of purchasing  small\nsolar home system (SHS) would be 61% of  typical rural Pakistani household\u2019\nannual income In essence, it means that even if consumers would benefit or save\nmoney by paying their monthly electricity bill, they could not afford the \u201cfirst\ncost\u201d of adopting  more electricity intensive consumption pattern With rural\nAfghanis spending the bulk of their income on food, they would be unable without\nsome form of subsidy to purchase  SHS This leads many countries to subsidize\nconnection costs even if they do not subsidize consumption or to provide other\nforms of concessional financing Fourth, even when the first cost problem is\novercome, the low population density coupled with the low income and low demand,\nwill mean that either: () the consumption will need to be met by small modular\nunits like solar; or () that  base load needs to be identified and developed\nsuch as  school or clinic or  larger scale economic use such as milling or\nirrigation Fifth, where incomes and consumption are unlikely to support\nelectricity, then rural electrification may need to focus on finding or creating\ncustomer that can act as the base load as well as subsidize the other users28\nThen, productive uses of electricity that will reduce costs, increase incomes or\nboth This must be rural the electrification activities It also means that this\nproductive use will subsidize other consumers Productive use here cornerstone\nfor most can be defined as either income generating activities such as milling\nor irrigation or end use in clinics or schools There is an important difference\nbetween these two types of productive uses In the first case, the productive\nuses are those that have economic impacts in the near term and those act to\nincrease consumption and ability to pay because the demand for electricity grows\nas income increases This first case impacts rural electrification in two ways\nFirst, it acts as  base load with the consequent reductions in the cost of\nsupply Second, in the near term it increases economic activity in the area and\nincreases demand due to the positive spillover effects In the second case, those\nthat consume education and health services will see an economic impact but it is\nusually in the distant future The second use can benefit rural electrification\nby acting as  base load and reducing costs in that manner All of this leads to\nsome important implications for the third prong of the energy strategy One,\nfocus on Two, determine the type of energy and amount of energy best suited for\nthat specific income follow an generating activity integrated model that\ncombines energy provision with that of other services The Global Village Energy\nPartnership provides an excellent platform for sharing experiences and lessons\nlearned income generating activities, Three, Finally, and most importantly,\nAfghanistan needs  program focused on rural energy needs as opposed to focusing\non rural electrification and one that is focused on appropriate technology\ninvestment The fourth prong is new supply of energy in transmission, such as new\ngeneration or distribution assets is principally concerned with the grid\nconnected transmission and systems \u2013 generation, distribution assets Priority\nactivities here remain the NEPS and SEPS and the activities in other energy sub\nsectors that support them It 28 This subsidization can be indirect in that the\nincrease consumption allows economies of scale in supply and lower costs For\nexample, the project sponsor identifies the use of electricity for  grain mill\nand then uses mini hydro instead of solar This will result in lower costs of\nproduction for all users The subsidization can be direct when the base load use\npays more than its marginal supply costs, thereby lowering the amount needed to\nbe covered from other users The overall policy framework for the sector is:\nRestructured energy sector governance and commercialized operations\nRehabilitation and expansion of the Afghan public power grid 32 AFGHANISTAN\nNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS)  Expansion of rural energy and electricity\nservices  Promotion of private investment to develop (including indigenous\nenergy renewable, natural gas, coal and oil) resources  Public Power Grid\nEmphasis on improved distribution

divest or assess the Liquid Fuels Enterprise\nunder the Ministry of Commerce and Industries Operating some 1600 gas pump\nstations and 1300 fuel trucks should provide considerable opportunity for\nprivate investment, improved quality of product and competitive pricing larger\nprograms \u2013 Renewable Energy There is not  coordinated approach in place to\nsupport the development of renewable energy sources  number of small renewable\nprojects are underway, many are affiliates of , alternative in poppy livelihood\nprograms growing regions Use of solar water heating and lighting, water pumping\nand micro-hydro can be expanded and privately operated In rural locations,\ncommunities have gathered resources to construct small hydro and limited solar\nfacilities that support minimal but important light and small power supply More\nemphasis required NEEDS ASSESSMENT Several needs assessments have been carried\nout They fall into two broad categories The first category projects demand and\nsupply or given an assumption about economic growth, investigates how demand and\nsupply will respond The second category is prescriptive in nature that is it is\nbased upon some policy variables and sets targets about how the sector should\nrespond For example, it sets  rate of household connections as  target and then\nuses Government policies and control of the sector to move towards that target\nEach of these is useful but one major drawback is that ALL have been at the sub-\nsector level \u201cThese studies have primarily focused on individual in issues lack\nof developmental comprehensive, energy sub-sectors such as power or oil and gas,\nin some specific instances illuminating important aspects of the strategic\ndevelopment of the energy sector in the overall context of Afghanistan\u2019\ndevelopment agenda At the same time, the sub-sector-based approach, while\nnecessary to adequately address the technical complexities of the energy sector,\nhas not captured the inter-related nature of energy and, sector consequently,\nthe trade-offs that may be entailed the strategic decision-making process\u201d29\nThis is  consequence of the fragmenting of energy across institutions and the\nintegrated planning policies and procedures In reality, no energy sub-sector can\nstand on its own but is highly dependent upon what transpires in the other sub-\nsectors For example,  forecast of the demand and supply of hydrocarbons that\ndoes not at the least consider the demand and supply of electricity,  major\nconsumer of hydrocarbons, will surely miss the mark While as an academic\nexercise this may have little consequence, nothing can be further from reality\nwhen scarce human, institutional and financial resources are required to develop\nan optimal mix In short, the failure to forecast and analyze on an integrated\nsectoral basis means suboptimal investment plans and operating conditions, and\nlower rate of economic growth than would otherwise have happened Thus, an\nOverall Energy Sector Needs Assessment does not exist and at this will be simply\nan aggregate of the individual sub-sector needs assessments ELECTRICITY The\nAfghanistan Compact developed at the London Conference in Jan-Feb 2006 defined\nenergy benchmarks for Afghanistan: \u201cBy end-2010: electricity will reach at least\n65% of households and 90% of nonresidential establishments in major urban areas\nand at least 25% of households in rural areas; at least 75% of the costs will be\nrecovered from users connected to the national power grid

remains ambitious\ngoalHydropower holds the greatest promise for Afghanistan followed by natural\ngas and coal Utilization of indigenous fossil fuels (natural gas and coal) for\npower generation is very limited as is utilization of solar, wind and other\nrenewable energy resources Figure  Cost of Power Under MEW Strategy Source:\nMinistry of Energy and Water Figure  shows that the cost of delivered power can\nbe significantly reduced through efforts by the IROA and MEW to displace costly\ndiesel power with other sources, such as natural-gas and coal and with lower\ncost power imports Most of the cost of power is associated with generation (as\nopposed to transmission and distribution), so replacing costly diesel generation\nwill have  major impact on the delivered cost of power

particularly in rural areas\u2014 in addition to policy\nconstraints\u2014have much to do with the investments required, the large scale of\nthe undertaking, and broad country issues (, security, remote location,\ndifficult terrain) These issues need to be effectively addressed through project\ndevelopment and implementation policies IROA and the short-term while Solutions\nto these problems can be found through  mixture of policies and programs that\ncontinue to rely on IROA involvement in the sector (with donor assistance)\nparticularly over the necessary framework is being put into place These programs\nalso need to unleash the potential of the domestic and international private\nsector to provide an expanded array of energy services and allow the withdrawal\nover time of direct involvement in the sector by the IROA and its transition to\nan oversight and regulatory function The IROA needs to explore options for\nachieving this goal and to put in place policies and programs that will remove\nbarriers to private participation in the energy sector IROA policy Examples of\nsupportive policies and programs include \u201cLight Handed Regulation for Stand\nAlone Systems\u201d similar to that currently practiced by the Omary Electric Company\nHowever, to be effective this needs to be part rural of an official\nelectrification The policy would allow self- contained power systems in rural or\nurban areas to be \u201cself-regulating\u201d in terms of setting service quality,\npricing, connection and disconnection standards, billing, etc and would apply to\ncooperative or private sector providers Basic licensing, safety and technical\nstandards would be applied by the GOA for the The need for small-scale, site\nspecific solutions means that significant technical and financial resources are\nrequired to bring modern energy services to the bulk of the rural population\nGiven the scope of the problem and limitations on Government resources, it is\nparticularly important to prioritize specific means measures to be pursued in\norder to maximize ensure sustainability The Government should seek to promote\nrural electrification with an income-generating activities where possible\nemphasis impact and on fossil versus the the benefit of importance of This\nunderscores maximizing limited resources and of considering the trade- offs\nwithin an overall Energy Sector Strategy of rural versus urban programs;\ngovernment versus private intervention; and renewable energy resources Given the\nscope of rural energy needs and IROA resources, it is important to prioritize\nspecific measures to be pursued, to ensure that they meet IROA objectives and\nthe effort by the GOA, donors and NGOs are properly coordinated to maximize\nresults limitations on the RECOMMENDATIONS To accomplish these goals within the\nEnergy Sector Strategy, the following activities should be pursued Increase\ncollaboration between MEW and MRRD and Delineate Responsibility  70 AFGHANISTAN\nNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS) for Rural Energy Development As noted under\nthe Electricity Sector section, responsibility for all rural-remote energy\nefforts should be consolidated within one institution, RLED, with membership by\nall stakeholders to help coordinate rural-remote energy programs and projects It\nappears that the MRRD is the proper entity to head up this effort Rural energy\nis defined as off grid applications such as SHS, micro-hydro, and diesels in\nareas of less than ,500 persons It could also include the use of wind power for\nboth electrical and mechanical energy, for example It would not include any grid\nconnected applications It also includes rural electrification Since there is no\nuniversal definition of rural, the definition for this purpose is something\nneeds to work out REDA would also be responsible for developing  rural-remote\nenergy master plan  In collaboration with NURC, develop Rural Energy Policy to\ninclude Light Handed Regulation as an official policy of the IROA and\nimplemented by the MRRD to promote development of stand-alone rural energy\nsystems by cooperatives or the private sector

goals,\nin addition to providing for energy development the Energy Sector Strategy will\nincorporate mechanisms to support cross- cutting issues that impact all energy\nsector initiatives These include the environment, counter narcotics, anti-\ncorruption, gender and regional cooperation\u2014in addition to capacity building\nENVIRONMENT Energy, even renewable energy, has an environmental impact This\nstrategy directly addresses environmental impacts by: (cid:131) (cid:131)\n(cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) Focusing on policies and\nprojects that the operating efficiency of improve energy production It strives\nto get the most energy delivered for the minimum environmental impact For\nexample, reducing technical losses or cogeneration Focusing on policies and\nprojects that improve end use efficiency These are areas that seek to reduce the\namount of energy needed for any given activity  CFL program is one such measure\nShifting investment and production to cleaner sources of energy, for example,\nwind power Through the promotion of combining energy supply with income\ngenerating activities, as incomes increase, there is less pressure on natural\nassets And, Through focusing on appropriate energy such as better cooking fuels\nand better lighting, thereby reducing indoor air pollution For oil, gas and\ncoal, current law provides  set of environmental requirements to conform to NEA\nregulations These will be incorporated into sector implementing rules and\nregulations In addition, all environmental impact assessment and pollution\ncontrol provisions of the Afghanistan Environmental Law will complied with the\nin construction, upgrading and operation of facilities and the generation,\ntransmission, distribution and use of electricity developed through this\nstrategy infrastructure regard for to (NEPA) will Impact in conjunction with\nJustice Energy The National Environmental Protection issue Agency new Assessment\nEnvironmental regulations the sector Ministry of institutions, including the\nMEW, MoM, and MRRD will establish  working relationship with the NEPA to learn\nabout the EIA process and ensure that its into all provisions are energy sector\nactivities incorporated ANTI-CORRUPTION The energy strategy directly tackles\ncorruption in several ways One of the most important measures for reducing\ncorruption is limiting the role or influence of Government In energy, we are\npromoting increased private sector participation; we are reducing the role of\nGovernment Additionally, in SOE\u2019, such loss reduction introduced as DABM, we\nprograms that are targeted at finding and deploying ways of controlling\ncorruption We are also introducing better, more transparent procurement\nFurthermore, procedures increasing private investment in the energy increased\nsector requires rule-of-law and transparency and accountability; thereby\nindirectly strengthening anti-corruption, and the anti-narcotics measures\nintroduction of  multi-sector regulator outside the concerned ministries and\nunder Finally, CROSS CUTTING ISSUES 73 the Ministry of Economy will provide\ngreater oversight REGION COOPERATION The most important areas furthering\nregional cooperation include expansion of energy trade by upgrading electricity\ntransmission ties with Central Asian countries and exploring options for\ntransport of electricity and natural gas through Afghanistan for regional supply\nThe NEPS represents one of the largest sector investments and the cornerstone of\nsuccess in NEPS is expanded energy trade Technical standards and commercial\ninstruments will be developed Physical investments are being made to improve\ntrade CASA 1000 is looking at using Afghanistan as an energy transit corridor\nRegional cooperation will be enhanced by projects such as NEPS and efforts to\nincrease cost-effective electricity imports from neighboring countries GENDER\nAND POVERTY REDUCTION Most energy interventions have the potential to provide\npositive benefits for women and children in particular and also for the poor in\ngeneral For example, women have specific energy needs in water pumping,\nagriculture processing, security, work productivity and health \u2013 most often that\nenergy is provided by their own that work effort meaning significantly longer\ndays than men More efficient stoves, drinking water pumping and agro-processing\nreduce women' workloads, improve their health, and expand income-earning\npotential can The energy sector has the potential to provide  wide pool of jobs\nas it is developed; for example, in the construction and repair of thermal\nplants, in coal mines, and in oil fields Labor intensive construction methods\nshould be considered For skilled technical jobs, the energy sector can training\nand apprenticeship schemes to provide on the job experience technical graduates\nand engineers Foreign personnel can contribute to such schemes as mentors and\ncan also be tapped to advice on competency based occupational analyses, new\ncurricula for training colleges and universities Planning for major energy\ndevelopment projects should trade and for new initiate involve an \u201cemployment\naudit\u201d which and indicates numbers permanent jobs expected; plans for training\nand replacement of foreign workers temporary of COUNTER NARCOTICS The strategy\ndoes not directly address this issue but it is clear that increased economic\ngrowth supported by an expanded energy sector particularly in rural and remote\nareas will help counter the cultivation of poppies and illicit drug trade In\nmany programs that have targeted poppy areas, success has been made when\nalternative livelihoods are found  cornerstone of this strategy is the linking\nof energy supply to income generating activities CAPACITY BUILDING Finally, the\nmajor emphasis within the Energy institutional Sector Strategy placed on\nstrengthening and capacity building\u2014and on institutional reform, such as\nconsolidating authority over rural electrification and rural energy projects and\nseparating policymaking in from regulatory authority\u2014will result fostering\nprofessional, open environment and increase opportunities for participation in\nenergy sector activities on behalf customers and other stakeholders This, in\nturn will support achievement of the ANDS cross- cutting goals The strategy\nexplicitly provides for capacity building projects and capacity building is one\nof the four pillars of the strategy Achieving improvements in capacity building\nrequires  coordinated approach The IROA has recently initiated the National\nCapacity Building Policy and Program designed to effectively address capacity\nbuilding and training needs throughout the Government It establishes an Inter-\nMinisterial Committee to coordinate and monitor capacity building efforts\nthroughout the IROA to ensure their program effectiveness implementation it\nestablished Implementation Management Units (RIMU) within IROA Ministries All\ncapacity building initiatives developed through the Energy Sector Strategy will\noperate through this mechanism, and will and Reform effectiveness, improve To 74\nAFGHANISTAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY (ANDS) include elements to address\ncross-cutting issues RISK ASSESSMENT Moreover, achievement of counter narcotics\nand anti-corruption goals will be promoted through Energy Strategy efforts to\nexpand access to electricity and promote economic development in rural and\nremote areas and to the sector by separating policy, reform function and\nregulatory, and operational promoting involvement by the private sector\nCOORDINATION AND EFFECTIVENESS: for improved  Government Use of the ICE\nmechanism as well as improved public information will be government essential\ncoordination in the energy sector Ideally, some now related if not duplicated\nenergy functions at various ministries will be consolidated and appropriate line\nministry \u201cterms of references\u201d for sector aspects will be drafted and agreed to\nit that is essential  International Community While an ICE working group on\ndonor coordination will be effective, the donors themselves improve the way in\nwhich they are engaged with the Afghan energy sector At present there are 25\ndonors engaged in the sector; in addition there are 15 different US agencies\nAfghan counterpart resources are limited and stretched; donors need to respect\nthese limits  Sector Governance, Firmly entrenched practices of how Government\nimplements sector operations have resulted in perceived and actual risk for\nviable private sector investment  lack of legal and regulatory basis from which\ninvestors ordinarily operate, no technical standards and  disperse array of\nsector institutions development for transparent procurement, contract certainty,\npredictability of the market and overall investor confidence responsible create\nserious risk for  Security outside sector control, Whether sometimes perceived\nor often real, security aspects of in Afghanistan remain at the fore of investor\nconcerns infrastructure development  Hardware and technical capacity Virtually\nnone of the equipment, supplies or spare parts required to operate the energy\nsector are produced or even available in the country When they are on the local\nmarket they are often of seriously technically inferior quality and at very high\ncost Some of the larger equipment (, diesel generators, drilling rigs) can take\nup to one year to procure or to lease Much of the modern technology that is\nbeing installed to upgrade the power sector has never been part of the system\nand no staff capacity exists to operate same; capacity building that includes\nhealth and safety awareness is essential CROSS CUTTING ISSUES 75 CHAPTER\nMONITORING AND EVALUATION Monitoring and Evaluation Reporting System:  Overall\nReporting, Because of the diversity and breadth of energy sector operations, it\nis impossible to have one reporting system; different technical, financial and\noperational reporting is required Still, there are common reporting requirements\nand approaches that will be followed (cid:131) (cid:131) Sector Specific\nReporting through Regulatory Bodies It is expected that the cadastre and\ninspectorate functions for hydrocarbons and mining will be operational by end\nAugust More momentum for power regulation is required but will also provide\nreporting requirements and monitoring standards presently absent from the sector\nLiquid fuels will also benefit from some external regulation Ultimately, the\nestablishment of  multi-sector regulatory body is possible (, would regulate\noil, natural gas, coal, electricity, liquid fuels, renewable) ICE Through the\nICE mechanism very definite reporting schedules have been instituted tracking\nhigh-priority projects (, Northeast Power System) as well as identifying project\nfunding and other gaps This mechanism will continue to play an important role in\nhow energy developments are tracked and monitored by Government  Project-based\nreporting, Because many energy projects are donor funded, international standard\nreporting and monitoring mechanisms are in place Government will abide by these\nrequirements and where possible, adopt them to line ministry and overall sector\nproject developments otherwise funded Fro details refer to Annex II (Monitoring\nMatrix)
