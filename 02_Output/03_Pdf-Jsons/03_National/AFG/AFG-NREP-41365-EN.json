gas created\nby anaerobic decomposition of organic material primarily through cattle excreta,\ncomposed primarily of methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulphide Biomass:\nenergy obtained from renewable organic matter such as agricultural crops and\nresidue, wood and wood waste, animal waste, aquatic plants and organic\ncomponents of municipal and industrial wastes Independent power producers:\nproducers of electricity who sell their power to electricity distributors for\nsupplying to the national grid Renewable energy: energy obtained from renewable\nnatural sources, such as the energy from the sun, wind, biomass, water and\ngeothermal resources Unlike, fossil fuels these sources of energy are abundant\nRenewable energy technology: technology that converts  primary renewable source\nof energy or energy resource to the desired form of energy supply   Introduction\nAfghanistan\u2019 consumption of electricity is one of the lowest in the world In\nNovember 2012, the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) estimated1 that 28% of the\nhousehold was connected to the power supply systems, the vast majority of whom\nlive in urban centres Rural power supplies continue to rely on hydropower, with\nlimited diesel and battery options, and are estimated to cover less than % of\nthe rural population This lack of access is significant in light of the fact\nthat more than 75% of Afghans live in rural areas2 and 67 per cent of the\nnational Gross Domestic Product (GDP) comes from rural areas3 The implication is\nthat the potential for development and growth in the rural sector, given\nappropriate investment, is significant, with access to energy as  contributory\nelement The 2012 Asia Foundation Survey of the Afghan People found that 14 per\ncent of respondents identified lack of electricity as  major problem in their\nlocal area4 Thus, the Afghan Government needs to initiate  sustained, long-term\nexpansion of rural energy, as identified in the Afghanistan National Development\nStrategy (ANDS), which emphasizes that the overall policy focus for rural areas\nshould be the expansion of rural energy and electricity services Afghanistan\nintends to pursue this objective by harnessing power from renewable resources \u2013\nan indigenous, clean, and abundant resource whose considerable potential the\ncountry has yet to exploit It needs to do so with the full participation and\ncollaboration of government agencies, the international donor community, non-\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs), the private sector and, not least, the\nbeneficiary communities themselves This policy is limited for the promotion of\nrenewable energy technologies through utilization of available local resources\nin the rural area and off-grid locations The policy will serve to provide\nenabling environment for various stakeholders, donors and encourage private\nsector investment for the development of rural energy technology in systematic\nand organized manner This policy will be  component of National Energy Policy of\nAfghanistan to be developed by MEW  Rationale While Afghanistan is  late starter\nin providing access to clean energy to its rural population, it embarks on the\njourney with considerable advantages First, there is now  prodigious body of\nexperience to guide policymakers in identifying and emulating successes and\navoiding the numerous failures of the past While the country presents unique\nopportunities and challenges,  Ministry of Energy and Water, Energy Policy\nDepartment Record  Central Statistical Organization: Estimated Population of\nAfghanistan 2012  Central Statistical Organization: Exports by Commodity and\nCountry 1391  The Asia Foundation:  Survey of the Afghan People, By province,\npercentages ranged from  per cent to 36 per cent  there is relevant experience\nin similar terrains, political, environmental and social contexts to enable the\ncreation of  suite of policy measures more likely to lead to successful outcomes\nRenewable energy is expected to provide increased energy security, energy\nindependence, diversity of supplies, and impetus to local industries, job\ncreation, social cohesion, rural development and environmental benefits  Policy\nObjectives The strategic objective of the Renewable Rural Energy Policy (RREP)\nis to create better social, economic and environmental conditions for the\ncitizens of Afghanistan in rural locations Its immediate objectives are to\nprovide an appropriate policy oversight and management mechanism able to ensure\nthat  sufficient level of efficient clean energy is made available to all rural\nconsumers In doing so, the RREP will aim to achieve the following: \u2022 To service\nthe energy requirements of livelihood activities that facilitates\ndiversification of rural employment opportunities and an improvement in rural\nincomes It is recognised that the deployment of renewable energy can supplement\nnational energy supply options to expedite economic empowerment, improve\nproductivity, and enhance income generation \u2022 To provide electric lighting for\nrural households, displacing hydrocarbon and solid fuel lighting, and enabling\nuse of basic household appliances and labour saving devices \u2022 To displace the\nuse of solid fuels for cooking and heating to the maximum extent possible \u2022 To\npromote social equity by providing access to renewable energy supplies that\nimproves human development indicators and alleviates poverty amongst deprived\nsections of society Rural electrification can thus facilitate social service\ndelivery and help improve the well-being of those living below the National\nPoverty Line without access to renewable energy supplies \u2022 To alleviate the\nenvironmental and health impacts of electricity generated by unsustainable and\ninefficient traditional biomass fuels and fossil fuels Displacing greenhouse gas\nemissions will provide significant global climate change benefits \u2022 To encourage\nenergy efficiency in parallel with the other objectives, to minimize long- term\ngeneration needs  Guiding Principles The specific principles of the RREP are: \u2022\nRenewable energy options will be pursued based upon renewable energy resource\navailability, distance from the national grid, community ability to operate and\nmaintain the particular renewable energy supplied, equipment cost, and the\nnumber of beneficiary households  \u2022 Where appropriate, the generation of\nproductive power will be  preferred option over stand-alone systems since the\nproductivity, income and welfare benefits derived will enhance future ability to\npay for supplies received \u2022 The impact of renewable energy in rural areas will\nbe optimized wherever possible by integrating energy solutions with the\nprovision of social infrastructure, such as educational and medical facilities,\nclean water supply, irrigation and agriculture, roads and telecommunications, so\nas to promote greater social welfare, productivity, trade, and economic well-\nbeing amongst beneficiary communities \u2022 Since mini-grid costs depend\nsignificantly on local conditions,  range of information will need to be\ngathered regarding village topologies, load profiles, and time series data on\nwind speeds and water flow \u2022 To facilitate private sector participation as rural\nenergy service providers, rural service delivery mechanisms may involve energy\nservice companies, equipment dealers or cooperatives \u2022 To overcome the high\ninitial system cost relative to conventional alternatives, and to provide  means\nwhereby households can continue to pay amounts equivalent to their conventional\nenergy purchases Long-term consumer credit through  microfinance organization\nmay be one mechanism to address initial costs \u2022 To support rural entrepreneurs\nwith  range of services, including training, marketing, feasibility studies,\nbusiness planning, management, linkages to community organizations as  means to\nexpand access to renewable energy services Measures will be devised to support\nthe private sector in mobilizing financing and enabling public sector investment\nin promotional, demonstrative, and pilot projects financing and \u2022 To operate\nenergy systems as sustainable business units, including cost recovery through\nrevenue collection, and for Operations and Maintenance (&), all community\nmembers will be expected to contribute cash or labour towards the construction\nof the renewable energy systems and pay against  pre-determined monthly tariff\nas agreed format In response to rural poverty, some level of investment subsidy\nfrom the government may be necessary to achieve affordability and meet the\nGovernment\u2019 rural electrification objectives \u2022 In mobilising rural communities\nand providing management training to operate and maintain household or community\nfacilities, special emphasis will be given to involving women in management of\nhousehold systems \u2022 Rural energy installations will demand the availability of\nprofessional technical service and support within  reasonable distance,\npreferably not beyond the immediate district \u2022 Clustering of installations,\nwhere appropriate, will be encouraged to support development of support\nfacilities, to produce marketable carbon credits to offset investment costs, and\nto improve sustainability \u2022 In applying the RREP, establishing  domestic\ntechnology manufacturing base is seen as one avenue to lower costs, improve\nservice quality, create employment, and enhance technical skills  \u2022 To provide\nsupport for the development and management of new technologies, and to increase\nefficiency of use of traditional energy resources, emphasis will be placed on\nresearch and development in rural energy technologies \u2022 To achieve widespread\ndissemination of renewable energy systems, capacity at all levels will need to\nbe developed  Legal and Regulatory Framework objectives An enabling environment\nrequires the introduction of certain regulatory measures from the Government to\nattract private sector and promote sustainability These regulatory measures will\ninclude: \u2022 Developing an appropriate legal framework for pricing and tariff\nstructures, working with rural communities to support the integration of\nrenewable energy into the economy and attract private sector investment \u2022 To\nsynchronise power generated from rural energy systems with the national grid,\nestablishing procedures and charges for transporting power from the point of\ngeneration to the customer through the national electricity grid using existing\ninfrastructure \u2022 Power purchase agreements between independent power producers,\nenergy providers and beneficiary communities \u2022 Development of  Grid Code for\nconnecting existing micro hydropower plants to national and/or regional grids\nThe legal and regulatory frameworks will be developed in collaboration with\nexisting frameworks for the overall development of energy sector, mainly\ncoordinated through MEW and Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat  Standards in\ncoordination by MRRD and MEW, As  subset of regulation, safety and quality\nstandards and codes of practice for generation, transmission and distribution\nwill be developed by Afghanistan National Standards Authority including through\nconsultation among (ANSA) stakeholders In addition,  certification, testing and\nenforcement unit for renewable energy will be established to ensure the\nacceptable quality of renewable energy technologies Service providers will be\ncategorized according to their products and services against agreed standards\nand will be required to meet minimum standards to be eligible in the supply of\nequipment or services The application and enforcement of standards, including\nthose associated with institutional capacity, and the establishment of domestic\ncertification, will contribute to financial and operational sustainability\nBarriers to Renewable Rural Energy Policy Implementation The significant\nbarriers to the implementation of renewable energy that need to be addressed\ninclude: \u2022 Poor institutional framework and infrastructure at the sub-national\nlevel for rural energy promotion \u2022 Quality of equipment and services related to\nthe renewable energy system installations \u2022 Poor baseline data availability; and\nlack of information on local renewable energy resources \u2022 The capital cost of\nrenewable energy technology is expensive compared to conventional energy fuels \u2022\nLack of consumer awareness on the benefits and opportunities of renewable energy\n\u2022 Financial, legal, regulatory and institutional barriers need to be overcome in\norder to implement renewable energy technology and develop markets \u2022  focus on\nthe consumption of energy in rural areas, rather than productive uses to address\nlimited economic opportunities there \u2022  low level of capacity at all levels of\nGovernment, private sector and non-governmental organizations for the promotion\nof renewable energy in Afghanistan In particular:  In villages there is  lack of\ntrained human personnel for &  At the district and provincial levels there is\nshortage of personnel trained in providing technical support  At the central and\nprovincial level there is lack of capacity in planning and project management\nPrivate sector manufacturing of micro-hydro equipment needs to increase the\nquality of its products and service reliability \u2022 Lack of security in areas of\nthe country  Renewable Energy Resources  brief summary of the Potential and\nStatus of Renewable Energy in Afghanistan is given below, which also describes\nthe current status of its development Hydro Potential Status For the near term\nof  to 10 years, the potential is estimated at least 800 MW for mini and micro\nAccording to the latest data base of MEW and MRRD, the total installed capacity\nof  hydro, which consists of hydropower plants, including storage based and run-\nof-the-river plants MHP plants in Afghanistan is about 36 MW and further  MW are\nunder construction throughout Afghanistan by various organization including MEW\nand MRRD associated programs MEW in coordination in GIZ has prepared provincial\nenergy profile with survey in  provinces Status Only  few micro wind turbines\nhave been installed in different parts of the country Through donor-supported\nprograms, seven wind measurement stations have been set up in different parts of\nthe country to receive long-term wind data at various heights and nine more are\nto be installed by mid- Wind Potential Commercially exploitable wind resources\nexist in many parts of the country The  National Renewable energy Laboratory\n(NREL) developed in 2006 high resolution solar and wind resource data at 50\nheight including maps for Afghanistan The findings indicate that 31,600 sq km of\nthe country can support large scale wind power plants Current potential\nestimated is around 158 GW from wind turbine in Afghanistan Major wind resource\nareas include North-western Nimroz, Western Farah, Western Herat, Eastern Balkh,\nNorthern Takhar and wind corridor areas include Near Jabalsaraj, Sarobi, and\nTirgari in eastern Afghanistan According to the latest report of MEW, due to the\nlow infrastructure and development, Afghanistan has technical feasible\ninstallation capacity of around 66,726 MW wind power Solar Potential Status  The\ncountry has excellent solar energy resources throughout its regions Typically\naveraging over  kWh/m2/day annual global horizontal insolation and estimated at\nleast 300 days for most of the country, with the south having the highest\ninsolation The US NREL in 2006, has developed high resolution solar data maps\nfor various season for Afghanistan There exists  significant potential for solar\nheating (water and space) and standalone and grid connected solar PV application\nfor household lighting The relevant guideline and quality standards of equipment\nand installation needs to be developed to ensure quality and reliability of\ninstallations MEW has estimated potential of 222 GW potential through solar\nenergy across Afghanistan Over 100,000 solar home systems (SHSs) have been\ninstalled in various parts of the country by MRRD However, MRRD discontinued the\nprogram due to quality related issues According to the latest survey of MEW, the\ntotal installed capacity of solar systems in Afghanistan is about 12 MW and\nfurther  MW are under construction throughout Afghanistan 10 Status Dried animal\ndung and crop residue are the two dominant sources of thermal fuel at the\nhousehold level These are followed by bushes and firewood, both of which are\ngenerally collected An estimated 200 small biogas digesters have been installed\nin Kandahar An Afghan NGO installed about 100 plants in Jalalabad area Recently,\nMRRD initiated biogas promotion in Nangarhar, Laghman and Kandahar Province\nBiomass/Biogas Potential Significant amounts of biomass are produced in the form\nof crop residues and animal waste, much of which is collected and used outside\nthe commercial economy as unprocessed fuel for household heating and cooking\nMunicipal solid waste produced by urban population is dumped The waste could be\ndisposed in proper landfills or incinerated to produce useable methane gas as\nfuel Establishment of provincial network of rural biogas service centres will\nprovide the infrastructure necessary to support dissemination, financing and\nmaintenance Also, training at community level of technical and managerial skills\nfor construction of biogas plants has to be developed Strategic efforts may\ninclude investing in design research to make biogas suitable for different\nclimatic conditions and developing models that take into account local problems\nsuch as low temperature, and different fuel inputs for biogas systems\nSignificant reduction in consumption of fuel wood with better kitchen\nenvironment could be achieved by improving traditional cook stoves to match the\ncooking habits in rural area through appropriately designed Improved Cook Stoves\n(ICS) According to the latest report of NREL \u201cAssessment of Biomass Resources in\nAfghanistan\u201d, Theoretically, Afghanistan has the potential to produce about ,408\nmillion cubic meters (MCM) of biogas annually from animal manure, based on the\nnumber of livestock in the country as of  and this volume is equivalent to about\n,619 GWh of electricity, and the electrical energy from the combustible portion\nof the Municipality Solid Waste (MSW) in Afghanistan\u2019 major urban areas, using\nthermo-chemical conversion, is estimated at 134 GWh per year 11 Status Prospects\nof low to medium temperature geothermal resources are widespread all over\nAfghanistan Geothermal energy reserves in Afghanistan could provide part of the\nelectricity needs required to satisfy the demand Geothermal Potential In\nAfghanistan, active geothermal systems are located in the main axis areas of the\nHindu Kush, which runs along the Herat fault system, up to the Wakhan corridor\nin the Afghan Pamir Geothermal systems of Afghanistan are mainly associated with\nthe fault and fracture networks, seismic activity encountered at this boundary\nand its associated branching fault systems There is potential for direct-use\napplications of these resources, such as in the food processing, fruit drying,\nrefrigeration, fish hatchery and farming, carpet and wool processing, recreation\nand tourism and other small- scale industries Development of potential\ngeothermal prospects for commercial use, reconnaissance surveys are required to\nidentify resources to the New York University, USA & According Afghanistan\nCentre for Policy and Development Studies, Kabul, 2004 in Afghanistan: Prospects\nand Potential, Afghanistan has enormous potential of geothermal energy report on\nGeothermal Energy  Scope of Policy For the purpose of this Policy, renewable\nenergy includes the following:  hydropower plants  wind energy  geothermal\nsolar energy, and  biomass This Policy is limited to renewable energy and rural\nelectrification through renewable energy off-grid systems to supply energy needs\nfor rural population in Afghanistan  General approach for renewable energy\napplications in rural areas  Arrangements will be made to provide technical\nassistance to provincial governments for the identification, planning and\nimplementation of renewable energy projects in rural areas  Guidelines and\nmanuals related to renewable energy systems will be developed  Renewable energy\nprojects will be connected to the grid where the grid is accessible 12  The\nprivate sector will be encouraged to work as service providers to manufacture\nequipment, and supply installation services and spare parts and also encouraged\nto work as energy service providers, and developers for rural renewable energy\nsystems  Renewable energy projects, wherever feasible, will be integrated\nalongside irrigation, education, health, drinking water, and small-scale\nindustry initiatives  Some of the wind and solar projects may require hybrid\nsolutions to provide continuous energy supply  Work will be initiated to prepare\nrenewable energy master plan through MEW and MRRD to identify potential and\nopportunities for rural areas    testing centre shall be established under this\nPolicy to test and certify renewable energy equipment and related accessories\nPublic awareness activities will be conducted to the benefits and opportunities\nof renewable energy  Mini/Micro-Hydropower Plants Subsidies will be provided for\nthe implementation of mini/micro-hydro plants up to  MW capacity through an\nappropriate delivery mechanism Communities will be encouraged to provide\ncontribution in terms of cash and/or labour for implementation Coordination with\nfinancial institutions will be undertaken to provide loans for such\ninstallations Appropriate operation, maintenance and management systems would be\nenforced for the sustainability of the micro hydro plants  Wind Energy Wind data\nwill be collected and analysed to establish the potential of wind energy\nsystems, mainly for electricity generation and water pumping Potential sites for\nexploiting wind energy coupled to livelihood opportunities will be identified\nSolar Energy Solar powered applications through solar photovoltaic and solar\nthermal for lighting, irrigation, community water supplies, water and space\nheating, and fruit and vegetable drying, will be promoted Appropriate subsidy\nmodels and delivery mechanisms will be prepared to promote solar energy in rural\nareas  Biomass  Biogas will be promoted to replace the use of fuel wood and\nanimal wastes as sources of energy for cooking  Emphasis will be given to\nresearch to increase efficiency, and to reduce the cost of household biogas\nproduction technology, including development and dissemination of community and\ninstitutional biogas plants  The establishment of biogas-related information\ncentres will be encouraged in coordination with local institutions 13\nTechnology for the production of biomass gasification will be developed and\ndisseminated through technology transfer  Consumption of biomass will be reduced\nand efficiency of fuelwood stoves enhanced by expanding the use and local\nproduction of fuel-efficient stoves  Geothermal  Efforts will be undertaken to\ndemonstrate the potential of geothermal energy as  pilot project in feasible\narea   database of geothermal sites will be developed  Policy Implementation\nRural electrification through renewable energy sources will be implemented in\nphased, gradual approach to be set out in  Policy implementation road map  Short\nTerm The Policy for the short term (up to the end of 2016) shall be as follows:\nPublic Sector:  portfolio of projects that will benefit rural populations (upto\n100 kW) will be identified in rural areas that are not likely to be profitable\nfor the private sector These projects will essentially comprise remote sites or\nrepresent areas characterized by uneconomic levels of power demand These\nprojects will be undertaken through public sector financing and/or through donor\ncommunity participation Project selection and criteria will be developed by the\nRural Energy Unit of MRRD\u2019 Rural Energy and Enterprise Directorate and MEW\u2019\nRenewable Energy Department Community capacity will be enhanced to take the\nresponsibility for sustainable & of these systems with backstopping support\nprovided through, among others, MRRD-based programmes Private Sector: The\nprivate sector will be encouraged to undertake commercially viable generation\nprojects using renewable energy Such projects and associated distribution grids\nnot connected to national or regional utility grids may be developed by private\nentities, public agencies, NGOs, community organizations, or individuals at any\nsuitable location The Government will develop regulatory frameworks for\nindependent power producers, including power purchase agreements and\nstandardized framework for tariffs Strengthening private entrepreneurship will\nbe an important strategy to fulfil rural energy needs Strategic approaches will\ninclude supporting rural entrepreneurs with training, marketing, feasibility\nstudies, business planning, and management and financing modalities Short term\nemphasis will also be on the design, demonstration, and testing of off-grid,\ncommunity, and stand-alone renewable energy systems, including financing and\nmarketing modalities Extensive widespread funding and deployment will be\ntargeted, based on initial studies and field evaluation, for the medium term\n(2017\u22122021), with financing arrangements to be in place by the outset of that\nperiod 14  Village mini-grids Village mini-grids are able to serve tens or\nhundreds of households in settings where sufficient geographical density allows\neconomical interconnections to  central power generator such as  small hydro,\nand contributing to an increase in rural industry and employment The Government\nwill facilitate the provision of credit, certificate or licensing procedures for\nprivate sector, power tariffs, and capital cost subsidies for projects that\nsupport the development of rural energy systems Donors will be requested to\nassist with technical assistance for technology development and manufacturing\nwithin Afghanistan  Business Models Sustainable and replicable business models\nfor both consumptive and productive uses of renewable energy in rural areas will\nbe developed In addition to existing solar home system business models, other\nmodels that promote long-term economic and social benefits will be adopted by\nbuilding mini-grids around income-generating micro-enterprises incorporating\nrenewable energy into water, agriculture, education and telecommunications In\nall projects, the ability to demonstrate  viable business model, whether public\nor private, will be key to achieving project sustainability and replication\nEffective policy approaches for reaching the poorest may combine private sector\ninvolvement with targeted public subsidies linked to development objectives and\nstrategies for increasing incomes Long-term consumer credit to overcome high\ninitial costs will be provided through dealer-facilitated credit and/or credit\nthrough, for example, microfinance organizations Private entrepreneurs in rural\nareas will be trained and financial assistance provided to establish Rural\nEnergy Service Centres that will provide technical services related to the & of\nrenewable energy systems at the local level  Financing In consideration of the\nhigh capital costs for many rural electrification options and the low cash\ncapacity of rural households, innovative small-scale, affordable financing\nmechanisms will need to be developed, which may include micro-credit, leasing,\nprepaid meters and fees for service provision The Government will investigate\nthe potential for micro-credit financing of renewable energy projects  Financial\nIncentives The following financial incentives will apply to renewable energy\npower projects, and equally applicable to private, public-private, and public\nsector renewable energy power projects:  No customs duty or sales tax shall be\nimposed for machinery equipment and spare parts meant for the initial\ninstallation or for balancing, modernization, maintenance, replacement, or\nexpansion after commissioning of projects for power generation utilizing\nrenewable energy resources  For the first  years of its commercial operation,\nthe renewable energy developer shall be exempt from income tax arising from the\nprofits derived from that operation  The Government may provide subsidies to\ncommunities to target the poorest segments of the population in rural areas 15\nEnergy Efficiency The introduction of energy efficiency, coupled with renewable\nenergy technology in rural areas, will help rural consumers by reducing supply\nconstraint and lowering their own energy expenditure Energy efficiency measures\nin off-grid and grid-connected systems will reduce costs through lower\ngeneration investment costs and reduced energy usage, and will also abate\npollution and displace the importation of fossil fuels  Medium Term Projects\nachieving financial closure during period 2017 through Utilizing international\nand short-term domestic renewable energy policy experience,  more comprehensive\nmedium term policy framework will be prepared for the systematic implementation\nof renewable energy technology and scaling up of capacity deployment  Long Term\nProjects achieving financial closure during period 2022 through Renewable energy\nwill be fully mainstreamed and integrated within the nation\u2019 energy planning\nprocess Renewable energy use at rural and urban household level will become\nwidespread, served by an established local manufacturing and service base It\nwill become mandatory for the power distribution facility to buy all the\nelectricity offered to them from renewable energy projects  Institutional\nFramework The institutional stakeholders in renewable energy in Afghanistan\ninclude the following  Inter-Ministerial Commission for Energy (ICE) / Rural\nEnergy Co- ordination Committee ICE, headed by the Ministry of Economy,\npreviously exercised oversight of energy sector policy and infrastructure\ninvestments and coordinates support from development partners ICE brought\ntogether  range of Government and donor interests to assure coordinated action\nand practical planning It was not responsible for project implementation but\ndeveloped policy in line with fiscal and policy priorities and international\nstandards The ICE Sub-committee on Renewable Energy and Rural Electrification\nbrought together Government agencies, donors and non-governmental actors\ninvolved in the sector Although the ICE closed during 2012, it is proposed that\nits ICE Sub-committee on Renewable Energy and Rural Electrification functions\nwill be undertaken by the Rural

promotion mainly for commercial and urban application and\ncoordination is the responsibility of Renewable Energy Department (RED) of MEW\nIn case, MRRD is implementing projects above 100 kW capacity, it will be\ncoordinated with MEW and the MEW when implementing projects below 100 kW in the\nrural area will be coordinated with MRRD The Government will be asked to\nallocate sufficient resources to MRRD and MEW to enable it to meet its stated\nobjectives REED will clarify current relevant practices in renewable energy\ndevelopment for rural area, set out standards and codes of practice for\nadoption, and establish implementation procedures and guidelines to attract and\nfacilitate donor assistance and private investment in renewable energy and rural\nelectrification It will coordinate and maintain oversight of the activities of\nall other stakeholders in the rural energy sector, and ensure that these\nactivities respect the Policy and procedures REED will liaise with the Ministry\nof Finance, the Ministry of Economy, MEW, the National Environment Protection\nAgency (NEPA), the Afghanistan National Standards Authority (ANSA) and other\nrelevant Government institutions on standardization, maximizing the socio-\neconomic impact of rural electrification while minimizing environmental hazards\nTo do so, it proposes to establish  Policy Oversight Committee as  formal\ncollaborative oversight and management mechanism, with membership drawn from\nMRRD, MEW and appropriate Government and international partners 18 At technical\nlevel, REED and RED will convene  Technical Working Group to include\nrepresentatives from MEW, NEPA, ANSA, MRRD, the Ministry of Mines, the Ministry\nof Public Health, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture,\nIrrigation and Livestock, donors, sector NGOs and any other pertinent body, to\ncoordinate renewable energy development and delivery of renewable energy\nservices to key economic and social sectors REED will maintain close liaison\nwith NEPA in working towards accession to the Kyoto Protocol, and to develop and\ncoordinate Clean Development Mechanism projects designed to qualify for carbon\ncredits to reduce the cost of investment in renewable energy rural\nelectrification REED and RED will develop  database for the assessment and\nimplementation of rural renewable energy projects, and disseminate this\ninformation to all decision-making bodies on all levels The renewable energy\ndatabase will include at the minimum, site selection criteria and evaluation,\npower needs assessments, funding options for projects, available programmes and\nprogramme information, and affordable and adapted energy solutions The private\nsector will be encouraged to participate and invest in rural electrification and\nin the deployment of energy efficient renewable energy technologies under this\nPolicy and in accord with the regulatory framework established by the Government\nThe international and bilateral donor community will be encouraged to assist for\ndeveloping  Strategy for policy implementation and provide financial assistance\nto Government of Afghanistan to develop renewable energy systems NGOs will be\nencouraged to participate in rural electrification through community\nmobilization and enhancing community social capital Representatives will be\ninvited to participate in Technical Working Group activities In the interest of\ncoordination, all participants will coordinate activities in renewable energy\nand rural electrification with REED of MRRD and RED of MEW They will maintain\nrecords of all renewable energy rural electrification projects with mapping of\nthe stakeholders working in the sector  Monitoring and Evaluation Monitoring and\nevaluation of this Policy and its implementation will be conducted by MEW and\nMRRD through policy oversight committee as follows:  Monitoring and evaluation\nactivity will be strengthened at all levels of rural energy development programs\nby establishing geographic and management information systems  Rural energy\nprogrammes will be monitored and evaluated based on output indicators  An energy\nauditing system will be developed and implemented 10 The Way Forward  strategy\nfor implementation of the RREP will be developed which will translate the\nobjectives and deliverables of the Policy into  practical implementation plan It\nwill be desirable, in 19 implementation strategy, to clarify and coordinate the\nroles and constructing the responsibilities of the various agencies concerned in\norder to build  coherent, inclusive and stable framework for success The purpose\nof the RREP is to create the conditions for the development of renewable\ntechnology for rural communities to meet their energy demand The Government will\nadopt  phased, managed and partnership approach to renewable energy projects\nthat are well conceived and show the potential to providing acceptable social,\nenvironmental and financial returns for all investors and stakeholders This will\nlessen the strain on fiscal resources and hold greater potential for successful\nimplementation An appropriate enabling environment towards full commercial\noperation will nurture the technologies that are proven to meet these Policy\nobjectives Progress towards meeting the targets, objectives and deliverables of\nthe RREP will be evaluated at the end of short term project implementation, to\nsee if these are being achieved and to determine whether the policy direction\nremains appropriate The RREP may be revised as required, based on the results\nfrom monitoring and evaluation activities 20"}
