These resources are spread over wide geographical areas \nthroughout the country, in contrast to the other conventional energy resources, which \nare concentrated and location specific. \nAfghanistan can produce around 318 GW of electricity utilizing available renewable \nenergy sources in the country through diverse renewable energy portfolio \nrepresenting Hydro (23,000 MW), Wind (67,000 MW), Solar (222,000 MW), \nGeothermal (3,000 \u2013 3,500 MW), Biomass (4000 MW). However, so far only parts of \nhydroelectric power projects have been implemented. \nRapid deployment of renewable energy projects in Afghanistan will bring significant \nsocio-economic benefit, employment opportunity and access to energy, energy \nsecurity, overall growth and possibilities for International Climate Change Mitigation \nsupport. The Government of Afghanistan would like to be a partner of international of \nmore than percent of energy supply. The national renewable energy market is \nexpected to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond.\nThe Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) has developed the Renewable Energy \nPolicy Afghanistan, and which envisage main streaming of renewable energy \nprojects in the development and growth of REN sector particularly in the PPP mode.\nThe Policy will be implemented in two terms \u2013 TERM 1 (2015- 2020) will create and \nsupport an atmosphere and activities for the development and growth of REN sector \nparticularly in the PPP mode, and will take remarkable tendency of private sector to \ninvest in renewable energy sector and TERM 2 (2021-2032) will deploy REN in full \ncommercialization mode, based on the experience gained under the short term, the \npolicy for the next phases will be consolidated and elements of competition will be \nintroduced.\nSome salient features of Renewable Energy Policy are:I. It invites investment from the private sector under the following categories of \nproposals:\na. Independent power projects (IPPs) for sale of power to the grid only. \nb. Captive power producers cum grid spillover power projects sells to electricity \nDistributer Company like small solar schemes top roofs. \nc. Isolated grid power projects i.e. small, stand-alone projects.\nII. Electricity purchase by Utility (ies) from qualifying renewable energy \nprojects that has been made mandatory under RPS. \nIII. This permits investor in accordance to electricity services law to generate \nelectricity based on renewable energy resources at one or multiple location (s) \nand receive an equivalent amount for own use elsewhere on the grid at the \ninvestor's own cost of generation by accounting transmission losses and paying \nfor wheeling charges. \nIV. This policy allows net metering and billing so that the producer can sell \nsurplus electricity at one time and receive electricity from the grid at another \ntime and settle accounts on net basis as agreed under power purchase \nagreement. This will directly benefit the economics of small scale power \nproducers, dispersed generation and optimize capacity utilization of installed \nsystems. \nV. The policy delicenses and deregulates small scale power production \nthrough renewable resources below 100 kW according to Part Three Article \nEight Clause Two of Afghanistan regulatory Electricity services law . These \nprovisions will beneficial micro, mini and small hydro projects as well as solar\u0002based electricity production. \nVI. This lays down simplified and transparent principles of tariff determination \nand insulates the investor from resource variability risk, which is allocated to the VII. This facilitates projects to obtain carbon credits for avoided greenhouse gas \nemissions, helping improve financial returns and reducing per unit costs for the \npurchaser. \nVIII. This policy strengthens guidelines according to economic strategies for \nattraction of private sector, And Ministry of Energy and Water is hopeful that this \npolicy avail for better condition of electricity distribution, take part in rapid \nsustainable economic growth and environment. \nIX. The policy may require an amendment and minor changes based on the \nexperience and /or technical difficulties of projects, utility (ies) payments, investor's \nsuggestions and recommendations. \n I wish to express my sincere gratitude to energy policy department by virtue \nof consideration their responsibilities with the support of German Cooperation \n(GIZ) has taken the initiative of developing Afghanistan Renewable Energy \nPolicy through a process of wide stakeholder consultations at different stages, \nfrom formulation till finalization of the policy.\n I thanks the German international Cooperation for their invaluable financial \nsupport and for drafting Afghanistan Renewable Energy Policy. I am strongly \nencouraged to see the participation of the Afghan people, International Community \nand sincerely appreciate the efforts of all those who contributed to the \ndevelopment of this important document. \nRegards\nEngineer Ali Ahmad Osmani \nMinister of Energy and Water\n#Acknowledgments\nThe work on this National Renewable Energy Policy was commissioned by the \nMinistry of Energy and Water through the Energy Policy Department and the \nRenewable Energy Department.

The country is endowed with renewable energy resources \nincluding solar, wind, hydro, bio-mass and geothermal. The Energy Services Law \naims at providing power energy through overall natural resources of the country and \nimporting power energy, thereby ensuring the deployment of Renewable Energy \n(REN) for improving the overall power scenario in Afghanistan.\nThe Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW), as one of the Key ministries to plan and \ndirect the development of energy sector in Afghanistan, has now prepared the \nAfghanistan Renewable Energy Policy (AREP) which aims to provide a thrust and \ndirection to the REN sector. \nThe Policy is aligned to the Power Sector Master Plan (PSMP) and the Afghanistan \nNational Development Strategy (ANDS) to set a framework for deployment and \ngrowth of REN and it connects with the Rural Renewable Energy Policy (RREP) to \nensure seamless adoption and implementation of the policy guidelines in rural energy \nsector. \nThe Afghanistan REN Policy sets a target for deploying 4500 \u2013 5000 MW of REN \ncapacity by 2032, which is equivalent of 95% of the total energy mix of 5000 \u20136000 \nMW as per the targets of PSMP. The scope of the Policy covers all REN resources and \ntechnologies that can be deployed in a techno-economically and environmentally \nsustainable manner in Afghanistan. The Policy will be implemented in two terms \u2013 \nTERM 1 (2015 \u2013 2020) will create and support an atmosphere and activities for the \ndevelopment and growth of REN sector particularly in the Public Private Partnership \n(PPP) mode, and TERM 2 (2021-2032) will deploy REN in full commercialization mode.\nA new entity Renewable Energy Coordination Committee (RECC) will be set up\nwithin the MEW, having statutory powers and the authority granted by the Presidential \nDecree, to oversee the implementation of AREP in TERM 1. The secretariat for the \nRECC will be hosted by MEW. Under the supervision of the Deputy Minister energy, \nthe Renewable Energy Department will be in charge for RECC secretariat, that will \nbe responsible for coordination among several government departments and \nagencies and effectively perform the implementation of AREP. Under the RECC \ntechnical working groups will be established from the offer-mentioned institution..\nThe decision for implementation of this policy for second Term will be taken based on \nanalyzation of first Term. \nSignificant features of the Policy are:\n1. The policy identifies high priority sectors with strategic objectives where \ndeployment of REN projects will be taken up in programmatic mode during TERM \n1.\n2. It supports detailed zone-wise-mapping of REN resources, preparation of \nREN Atlas for Afghanistan and involve in preparation and development of \nprovincial level maps and master plans.\n3. The policy facilitates decentralized governance and coordination structure \nthrough the creation of Zonal Renewable Energy Centers (ZREC) within RED.\n4. According to this policy, ministry of rural rehabilitation and development (MRRD) \nhas the authority to implement up to 1mw of renewable energy projects. it is worth \nmentioning that all Renewable Energy Projects with the capacity of 100KW under \nthe regulatory policy with coordination of MEW is implementable in rural areas. \n5. It encourages private sector involvement by providing financial incentives and \nother facilitation in terms of wheeling and banking, \u201cmust-run\u201d status, freedom to \nsale power to third party, land acquisition and leasing, licensing, regulatory sector, NGOs or CBOs, individuals on behalf of any Ministry, utility or donor.\n7. It specifies guidelines for setting tariffs for different categories of REN \nprojects.\n8. It lays the foundation for setting up \u201cbasket-funds\u201d for REN projects which would \nevolve into a dedicated REN financing institution in TERM 2 of the Policy \nimplementation.\n9. It recognizes the importance of institutional strengthening and possible \nreorganization, including setting up of new institutions and facilities camps.\n10. It mandates the use of standards, quality control, monitoring, knowledge \nmanagement, supports local manufacturing units, user training and awareness \ncreation.\n11. The policy recognizes the need to establish Feed-in-Tariff, Regulated \ninvestment Return Net/Smart Metering, Market Premium, Tax Based Incentives, \nFinancial Incentives such as Grants, term L soft term loanss, Loans, Rebates and \nProduction Incentives\n12. The policy also supports Rules and Regulations, Grid and Mini Grid \nRegulation, Market Regulation, National Strategic Reserve, Capacity \nMechanism, Demand Response incentives, Introduction of REN Portfolio \nStandards (Quota Schemes), Ring Fence Budget, the mandatory requirement to \nsell of Green Power, Fuel disclosure, policies, and subsidies as considered and \ndeclared by the Renewable Energy Department, Ministry Of Energy and Water. \n13. It encourages and envisages active participation of women on supply and \ndemand side of REN projects.\n14. It provides a platform to integrate environment and energy efficiency with REN \nsector. \nThe Policy is dedicated to realizing the vision of Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan \u2013 Asociety of hope and prosperity based on strong, private sector \nled economy,social equity and environmental sustain ability\n#1.0 Context and Background\n1.1 Afghanistan is poised for stability and growth and would require reliable \nsupply of energy to fuel this growth. Afghanistan National Development Strategy \n(ANDS) recognizes energy as one of the pillars for the socio-economic development \nof the country within which Expanded or New Supply from renewable energy \nresources is one of the important components. The Afghan Energy Strategy contains \nan implicit prioritization of energy sub-sector activities. Electricity is given far greater \npreference or priority than other sectors on the belief that modern economies are built \non electricity. Accordingly, the strategic goals of Afghan power sector, succinctly \ndefined in the Power Sector Master Plan (PSMP) are to take the rural household \nelectricity connections from a current 28% to 65% level and urban households to \n100% level by 2032. The National Energy Supply Programme (NESP) in line with the \nPSMP aims to prepare for delivery of sufficient electricity to support economic growth \nat a rate of about 10% per annum to support the Government's broader goal of \nreducing poverty by 3% per annum and doing so in a cost effective manner given the \nfiscal realities of Afghanistan. Renewable energy will play a key role in achieving the \nabove goals. \n1.2 Afghanistan has a total generation capacity of 1450 MW out of which 80% is \nfrom imports. It has another 50 MW off-grid installed capacity from renewable energy \n(REN) resources. Afghanistan's low per capita consumption of energy (3.73 million \nBtu per annum in 2011), of electricity (195 kWh per annum3) and its energy self\u0002sufficiency of 35% can be enhanced through the use of renewable energy. Use of \nrenewable energy will also improve the energy security of the country. Issues \npertaining to equitable access to modern energy supplies, improved human \ndevelopment indicators, safety and security of vulnerable population including \nwomen and children, poverty reduction, among others can also be adequately lowest (0.3 metric tons) in the world, the use of renewable energy and its positive \nrelationship on impact of climate change would ensure that the country adopts a low \ncarbon approach to growth while at the same time protecting the local environment \nand reducing the adverse health impacts of using conventional fuels in domestic and \ncommercial activities.\n1.4 The PSMP has suggested network planning and expansion in stages wherein \n17 provinces willbe taken up in first phase, 13 in the second and 3 (Daykundi, Nuristan \nand Ghor) where network connections are not economically viable for a multitude of \nreasons. Renewable energy systems could be the only option for providing energy in \nthese three provinces and can play an important role in other provinces.\n1.5 The renewable energy sector continues to grow globally. It provided an \nestimated 19% of global final energy consumption in 2012, and this figure is growing \nin coming years.. Of this total share in 2012, modern renewables accounted for \napproximately 10%, with the remainder coming from traditional biomass. Further, at \nleast 144 countries have renewable energy targets and 138 countries have \nrenewable energy support policies in place.\n1.6 Afghanistan is endowed with good renewable energy resources. According to \nthe estimates, it has 222 GW of solar potential, 67 GW of wind and 23 GW of hydro \npotential. In addition, biomass and geo-thermal resources are also available in the \nCountry.\n1.7 The Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) is the nodal Ministry to plan and \ndirect the development of energy sector in Afghanistan. Promotion and use of \nrenewable energy is an integral component of this mandate. The MRRD coordinates \nwith the MEW in deploying renewable energy for rural development within a specified \ncapacity framework . The first draft of the Rural Renewable Energy Policy (RREP) has \nbeen developed by MRRD and will be finalized in coordination with MEW and other \nrelevant stakeholders to guide their efforts in this direction. Da Afghanistan Breshna \nSherkat (DABS) is a joint stock government company in the field of power which is \niblthrough existed facilities, its transmission, dispatching, distribution and provision \nthroughout the country.\n1.8 The Renewable Energy Coordination Committee (RECC) with the \nsupport of the Inter-Ministerial Commission for Energy (ICE) and provincial energy \nworking groups assigned the task of overall coordination between MEW and MRRD \nfor activities and efforts pertaining to renewable energy projects development. \n1.9 The renewable energy projects in Afghanistan have so far been supported \nextensively by the donor community. Some of the recent initiatives include 1 MW off\u0002grid solar plant in Bamyan, and 2.2 MW of solar and MHP projects in Takhar and \nBadakhshan provinces. In addition, donors have also supported technical assistance \nand capacity building activities. The Technical and operational guidelines for MHP\nand photovoltaic power systems, and technical handbook for micro hydro design \nhave been developed. An online renewable energy database of projects has been \nprepared, which up to date over 5000 REN projects consisting of MHP, wind and \nsolar are completed and 500 are under construction. \nThe total installed capacity of these completed and under construction projects is \n57,500 kW. Another 100 projects are under planning stage3.\n1.10 The REN sector on account of its potential to support the growth of \nAfghanistan's economy is continuing to attract donors. Some of the likely initiatives \nare\u0002a) Development of a renewable energy roadmap for the country; \nb) ARapid Assessment / Gap Analysis, with major components focused on renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency as part of SE4All initiative; and\nc) A market assessment survey for renewable energy projects, which will include \nelements of understanding Willingness to pay (WTP), market size and potential by the creation of an industry association.\n1.12 While the donor support for REN is important, there is a scope for improved \ncoordination and synergies among various donors to support this sector which \neventually has to be self- sustaining. From the current donor-supported status, the \ngrowth trajectory of REN sector has to follow the path of Public-Private-Partnership \n(PPP) driven in the interim, to private sector led fully commercial in the long term. The \ninvolvement of private sector through the newly created industry association with the \ndonors in PPP mode could be a beginning of this growth trajectory.\n1.13 Against this backdrop, the Afghanistan National Renewable Energy Policy \n(AREP) aims to provide a thrust and direction to the REN sector to follow the above \ngrowth trajectory. The AREPis aligned to the PSMPand the ANDS on one hand to set \na framework for deployment and growth of REN; it connects with the RREP on the \nother to ensure seamless adoption and implementation of the policy guidelines in \nrural energy sector. It proposes to optimize the impacts of integrating renewable \nenergy based solutions with overall rural infrastructure development e.g., educational \nand medical facilities, roads and telecommunications, clean water supply and \nsanitation, etc., to enhance social welfare, security, productivity, trade, and economic \nwell-being. Further, it also facilitates the involvement of the public good and the \nprivate sector investment in REN and identifies support mechanisms that are \nrequired to build an environment for its growth in Afghanistan.\n#2.0 Vision\nThe Vision of AREP is enshrined in the Vision of Afghanistan- A society of hope and \nprosperity based on strong, private sector led economy, social equity and \nenvironmental sustainability \u2013 and its overall objective is to optimally deploy and \nutilize renewable energy resources in all possible manner to realize this Vision. \nSpecific goals of AREPto meet the said objectives are presented below:\n#2.1 Goals\n1. The goal of the policy is to Meet the short-term energy needs while \nstrengthening the sector in the long-term, covering sustainable development \nobjectives and substantive share of REN projects. \n2. Increase the deployment of Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) in \nAfghanistan to meet the targets of PSMP, i.e. 95% of the total energy mix of 5000-\n6000 MW in 2032 through grid-connected, mini-grids and stand-alone projects in a \nmanner that REN resources would complement and supplement other forms of \nenergy.\n3. Provide fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to private sector investors and \nequipment manufacturers / suppliers to lower the cost of investment, enhance the \ncompetitiveness of RETs and nurture the local industry including equipment \nmanufacturers, suppliers and assemblers.\n4. Create mechanisms of involving Government Organization (GOs), Non\u0002Governmental Organizations (NGOs), donors and communities through capacity \nbuilding, awareness creation, networking and exposure visits to support the growth \nand sustenance of REN sector in Afghanistan.\n5. Foster international cooperation, particularly with countries in the region \nhaving similar socio-cultural milieu for cross learning and adoption of good \npractices.\n6. Help building safe environment by reduce air pollution, safeguard human \nhealth and the environment, provide power to off-grid rural areas as well as help to \nThe Vision of AREP is enshrined in the Vision of Afghanistan- A society of hope and \nprosperity based on strong, private sector led economy, social equity and \nenvironmental sustainability \u2013 and its overall objective is to optimally deploy and \nutilize renewable energy resources in all possible manner to realize this Vision. \nSpecific goals of AREPto meet the said objectives are presented below:\n2.1 Goalsobjectives of energy security through Incentive policies to be structured to encourage \nthe development of renewable energy technologies and provide market opportunities \nfor renewable energy companies to facilitate local governments, industries energy \nenterprises and communities to benefit and promote renewable energy\n#2.2 Scope\n1. AREP covers all renewable energy resources and technologies in any capacities \nfrom Pico watt to megawatt (except for hydro), that can be deployed in a techno\u0002economically and environmentally sustainable manner in Afghanistan. This includes, \nbut not limited to, solar (photovoltaic and thermal), wind, biomass, small hydro, \nbiogas, municipal waste, geo-thermal, fuel cells, clean storage and hybrids of any of \nthe two or more of the above, including hybrids of REN with conventional fuel based \noptions such as diesel generators and fossil fuel power plants.\n2. Hydro projects up to 3 MW installed capacity, consisting of pico, micro, mini and \nsmall hydro, (as per the below table) will be treated as REN projects and will fall within \nthe purview of AREP.\nPico <2.5 kW;\nMicro <250 kW;\nMicro <2500 kW;\nSmall <25000 kW;\n1. AREP covers all modes through which REN projects can be developed. This \nincludes grid- connected, mini-grids, hybrids/stand-alone modes.\n2. The REN will be used in following applications, but not limited to:\na. Centralized power generation and feeding to the national and private utility's \ngrid.\nb. Mini-grids for distributed generation and supply of electricity for\nI. nearby loads in industrial, commercial and residential sector under third party iii. replacement of and/or hybridize with diesel based power generating and \nsupply projects\niv. rural electrification\nc. Stand-alone systems and devices for:\nI. rural community access for their basic electricity requirements like Roof-top \nsolar\nii. agricultural and other productive applications in both agricultural and non\u0002agricultural sectors\niii. usage in rural health centers, street and area lighting, computers in schools, \ndrinking water supply, community welfare center etc.\niv. telecommunication purposes such as mobile phone towers, television etc. \nv. strategic establishments such as in the military\nv. thermal energy for cooking, water heating, steam production, process heat, \nspace heating, and other usage.\nvi. Building energy and green habitats\nThe AREP will be implemented in two TERMs to achieve the above goals:\n#2.3 Implementation of AREP\n1. AREP TERM 1 (2015- 2020) will create and support an atmosphere and \nactivities for the development and growth of REN sector particularly in the PPP\nmode. It will facilitate a transition from donor supported to private investment \ndriven REN sector with an objective of deploying REN in full commercialization \nmode during its TERM 2 (2021-2032).\n2. The overall goal is to achieve 95% of the total energy mix of 5000 MW to \n6000 MW by 2032 translating to a deployment of 4500 MW to 5000 MW of RETs..\n3. In order to achieve the above targets, AREPTERM 1 will identify high priority \nsectors with strategic objectives where deployment of REN projects will be taken \nup in a programmatic modeAfew of these high priority sectors are:objective of reducing the consumption of diesel and switching to a cleaner option.\nb. Rehabilitation of non-operational/ partly operational REN projects \npreferably through PPP mode ensuring their socio- economic sustainability.\nc. Provinces which will not be serviced by DABS in near future as per the \nPSMP.\nd. Distributed generation in economic zones and industrial parks for providing \nreliable electricity to boost commercial and industrial activities.\ne. Grid-connected projects in Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) mode.\nf. Solar and/or wind pumping with finance facilitation to farmers for increasing \nthe agricultural productivity.\ng. Powering mobile telephone network and other telecommunication \ninfrastructure through REN in remote areas for enhancing safety and security of \ncommunities. \nh. Roof-top solar PV projects with or without net metering.\nI. The RE Project for growth of Agriculture sector to supply energy for \nspringhouses, livestock's etc.\u2026\nj. Biomass energy projects for the rural communities and livestock's.\nThe proper AREP implementation will lead to formation of Renewable Energy Law for \nAfghanistan by 2032, clearly defining the energy share from renewable energy to \nkeep that growing as per Afghanistan National Strategy and other related policies.\n#3.0 Potential and Cost of REN Resources and Technologies\n3.1 The macro level mapping of REN resources in Afghanistan has been done and \nis presented in the below table.\n3.2 In order to facilitate the long-term planning for REN projects, a detailed zone\u0002wise mapping of REN resources would be undertaken and the REN Atlas for \nAfghanistan will be prepared.\n3.3 In case of MHP, it should be ensured that the full potential of any identified site \nbe deployed while designing project sizes and capacities.\n3.4 Guidelines for calculating Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for each RET\nusing global cost trends but customized to Afghanistan, would be prepared to \nprovide the basis for bench marking project costs, preparing budgets, estimating by including all costs for operation, maintenance, repair and replacements for at \nleast 10 years of the project life. Further, the project design should also include the \ninstitutional mechanism for O&M for the entire project life.\n3.6 Provincial level master plans will be prepared that should have resource \nmaps, indicative LCOE for each deploy able REN in the province, potential \napplications and load centers, database of NGOs and their initiatives in REN, and \navailability of local manufacturers and suppliers. This will help in implementing \nREN projects in a techno-economically viable manner.\n#4.0 Institutional Arragement for Implementation of AREP\n4.1 The MEW will have primary responsibility for strategizing, planning and \ncoordinating the implementation of AREP. In TERM 1 a coordination committee \nheaded by Deputy Minister of Energy will be established under framework of MEW \nthrough Policy department RE which is one of their tasks to analyses, monitor and \nimplementation of this policy. Secretariat of this Committee will be with RED \n In TERM 2 after analyzing TERM 1 implementation of this policy will be reviewed.\n4.2 Given the importance of REN and the role it will play in the socio-economic \ndevelopment of Afghanistan, its development needs to be put on a \u201cfast-track\u201d \nmode. \nRenewable Energy Coordination committee which will be established under MEW \nand work under the Deputy Minister for Energy the mandate of the RECC is to \ncoordinate with all relevant gov/non gov entities for the implementation of this policy. \nRenewable energy department is responsile for the RECC. The committee has \ntechnical working groups which the experts will be the mention entities they will work \naccording to the specific plan that will be issued by the RECC. \u2013\n1.2 7:2- In second term according to the evaluation of first term for the \nimplementation of the policy decision will be taken.\n1.3 7:3- keeping in view the importance of the renewable energy social and \neconomic development environmental protection in Afghanistan it is needed to \n4.0 INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENT FOR \nIMPLEMENTATION OF AREPPublic health, communication and technology, women affair, education, NEPA, \nUrban development, ANSA, Municipality of Kabul, private sector DABS, and non\u0002governmental organization among others.\n1.5 7.5 - The RECC will be developed as coordination committee to coordinate and \nfacilitate the commercialization and growth of REN sector during TERM 2.\n1.6 7.6 - The Renewable Energy Department (RED) of MEW will be the main \ntechnical body responsible for, but not limited to the following:\na. Assessing REN potential and preparing detailed resource maps.\nb. Preparing provincial level REN master plans.\nc. Developing technical designs, benchmarks and performance standards.\nd. Providing technical assistance and oversight to MRRD, DABS and other GOs \nin designing and implementation of their REN projects on needs basis.\ne. Providing technical support to local industry and manufacturers on needs \nbasis.\nf. Providing technology specific and other technical inputs to MOF for designing \nfiscal incentives, specifically for facilitating the investment from the private sector.\ng. Designing and implementing pilot and demonstration projects that support \neither new technology or innovative concepts such as the Public-Private-People\u0002partnership, women entrepreneur led REN projects, REN projects to \nsupport MDGs and Post-2015 Development Agenda, roof-top projects on \ngovernment buildings. This will be done in coordination and collaboration with \nother agencies.\nh. Coordinating with donors and other funding organizations to ensure synergy \nof projects.\nI. Facilitating technical training, awareness generation and capacity building of \nstakeholders across GOs and NGOs.\nj. Be the nodal department in relation to all REN matters.decentralized governance and coordination structure will be set up wherein zonal \nlevel bodies known as Zonal Renewable Energy Centre (ZREC) will be created to \noversee the implementation of REN in their respective regions. The ZRECs will \ncoordinate with RED of MEW in executing all of the above responsibilities. The \nZRECs may be set up at technical and academic institutions, with NGOs that have \nrequired capabilities or within any other existing institutional structure such as that \nof DABS and MRRD. There are already five RED zonal units that have been \ncreated in five river basins of Afghanistan and in TERM 2 of AREP, new units will be \nset up.\n4.7 Considering the presence of large rural population in Afghanistan that will \nbenefit the most from REN projects, MRRD will support the implementation of rural \nREN projects of upto one (1MW) MW capacity for providing energy services to \nvarious rural development related applications including domestic, productive, \nhealth, education, water pumping etc. and will coordinate with other Ministries such \nas MAIL and MPH. MRRD can implement RE projects beyond the 100 kW limit to \nutilize the maximum potential of the resource with coordination with MEW \naccording to the Electricity service Law..\n4.8 Utilities (such as DABS) will be responsible for the operation and maintenance \nof all grid-connected and mini-grid projects of above 100 kW capacity. However, for \nO&M of rural REN projects below the capacity of 100 kW, utilities will \ncoordinate with MRRD. \n4.9 Private sector as IPP, communities and local entrepreneur will be encouraged \nto develop and manage REN projects on Built-Own-Operate (BOO) basis, and will \nbe governed by appropriate regulations.\n4.10 Recognizing the catalytic role that NGOs play in implementation of rural \ncommunity oriented and community focused REN projects, it would be important to \nput a formal coordination mechanism in place to ensure exchange of information \nand ideas on one hand, and to avoid overlaps of efforts on the other. Such a \nmechanism would be institutionalized in TERM 1 which would also include \nincentivization, facilitation and felicitation of NGO led efforts. This mechanism will \nbe upgraded to a registration \u2013cum- approval platform in TERM 2.\n4.11 The policy will create formal linkages and cooperation arrangements with \norganization such as IRENA, SAARC Energy Centre, ECO and others.\n#5.0 Regulation, Icentivization & Facilitation for private Sector Participation\n#5.1 Guidelines for setting up REN projects\n1. The main aim of the AREP TERM 1 is to prepare the atmosphere to usher in the \ncommercialization of REN through private sector participation which will be seen in \nfull force during AREP TERM 2. The REN sector has so far been supported mainly \nby donor funds, which is not a desired scenario for sustaining the REN sector in \nAfghanistan. It is therefore essential to attract adequate investments from the \nprivate sector as the donor and government resources will not have sufficient funds \nto support the REN sector. However, balancing the requirement of attracting \nprivate investments by ensuring appropriate return on investment and that of \nensuring reasonability of user charges for the consumers is the critical challenge \nfor the regulatory process.\nSince the donors supports are not sustainable, in TERM 1 atmosphere for private \nsector should be paved.\n2. Therefore, the REN development in TERM 1 will happen under PPP mode \nwherein a synergy of regulations, incentivization and facilitation will instill the \nconfidence among the private sector to invest in REN projects in Afghanistan. \nWhile the entire sector is open to investments from the private sector, in terms of \npriority, the grid-connected large scale projects are likely to be the first ones to \nattract private investment, followed by the distributed generation sector and then \nthe off-grid stand-alone sector. This prioritization is on account of the risk \nperception among the private sector on return of its investment. Accordingly, the \nAREP TERM 1 will set out following guidelines for attracting private sector \ninvestment in REN sector:\na. Guidelines for setting up grid-connected REN projects.\nb. Guidelines for setting up projects for distributed generation with local grid.\nc. Guidelines for setting up off-grid stand-alone projects.criteria; registration process; application process including DPRs and technical \ndesigns; clearances and approvals; land acquisition and usage for private, \ngovernment and community land; grid-connectivity; creation/ use of other \ninfrastructure and facilities such as roads and water; legal, commercial and \ncommunity related agreements including Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs); \nsafety certifications and quality control procedures; performance guarantees; post \ncommissioning obligations and activities; exit options, both mid-way and at the end \nof agreed project lifetime; issuing of license (generation, transmission, distribution, \noperation and maintenance). \n#5.2 Financial incentives\n Considering the fact that REN projects have so far received full funding from donors \nand are still not able to self \u2013sustain, provision of subsidies is considered necessary \nand unavoidable. However the subsidies would be reviewed, rationalized and \ncarefully targeted keeping in view affordability and cost effective delivery of reliable \nenergy services. The upfront capital support in the form of subsidies will be \nprovided to all REN projects in order to make them viable by either improving the \nreturns on investment or by reducing the tariffs for commercial and domestic (both \nurban and rural) consumers. The amount and pattern of subsidy will vary \ndepending upon the technology, location and the design of the project. For \ninstance, stand- alone projects providing basic energy services to remote \ncommunities, projects supported by women, or benefiting women and children may \nreceive the highest allocation of subsidies. Subsidies could be given in the form of \nPreferential Tariffs, Performance Linked Incentives or Viability Gap Funding. Other \nincentives given to the developers of REN projects will include:\na) Interest subsidies and soft loans (low interest rates, moratorium/ grace \nperiod on repayment, favorable debt-equity ratio).\nb) Customs duty and sales tax exemption for import/ sale of machinery \nequipment and spare parts meant for the initial installation or for balancing, \nmodernizationmaintenancereplacementor expansion after commissioning of its commercial operation.\nd) Land acquisition\ne) Security during project implementation.\nf) Other incentives and rebates that are considered necessary from time to \ntime and on case-by-case basis.\n#5.3 Tariffs\nIn accordance with the regulatory guidelines20, procedures and processes, following \nmethodology would be adopted for tariff setting for REN projects\n1. For grid-connected projects- Tariffs for grid connected projects will be set on the \n'cost- plus' basis. Afirm PPA will be signed between MEW, DABS and Private utility \nand the project developer mentioning the tariff, including the escalations.\n2. For project having distributed generation and local grid- for distributed \ngeneration projects supplying electricity to third party, tariffs will be decided on \nmutually negotiated basis between MEW/ utility, the project developer and the \nconsumer. Guiding principle for tariff determination could be 'cost- plus basis'. \n'Avoided cost of generation' would be the basis in those regions where \nconventional generation would probably be significantly more expensive than REN \nsource generation, as fuels have to be transported. A firm PPA will be signed \nbetween the project developer and MEW/utility. Explain with example (could be \ndeleted)\n3. For REN-diesel hybrid projects- Tariffs will be based on replacement cost of diesel \nand/or prevailing tariffs whichever is less.\n4. For off-grid stand-alone project- Tariffs will be on mutually negated basis with an \noversight provided by the ZREC to ensure that vulnerable communities are not \nburdened with high and unaffordable tariffs for basic and essential electricity \nservices.\n#5.4 Wheeling and banking\nAll grid-connected projects meant for third party sale or for captive generation will be \nallowed to wheel and bank the electricity through the national grid owned and \noperated by utility company (DABS). Aseparate wheeling and banking agreement will \nbe drawn up between utility company (DABS) and the project developer. The same \nprinciple will apply to other private distribution companies that are likely to come up in \nnear future.\n#5.5 Evacuation of electricit\nThe project developer of grid-connected project will be responsible for laying the \npower evacuation lines from the generation point till the substation or interconnection \npoint of utility company (DABS). Utility company (DABS), on the other hand will give \nthe \u201cmust-run\u201d status to all REN projects to ensure that all the electricity generated \nthrough REN projects in evacuated and utilized.\n#5.6 Third party sale\nAREP allows project developers to set up REN projects both for captive and for third \nparty sale of electricity. In either case, the electricity so generated, will be wheeled and \nbanked either through the utility company (DABS) grid or through a separately \ncreated localized grid. In case of latter, the localized grid must adhere to the national \ngrid codes and safety standards, and should be designed in a grid-compatible mode \nso that their integration with the national grid is possible in future, if need arises.\n#5.7 Land acquisition and leasing\nGovernment will facilitate the acquisition of land to project developers for setting up \ngrid- connected and mini-grid REN projects and in some cases, procure and lease \nthem out to the developers on long term basis. The procedure for land leasing will be \non the basis of competition. The project developer will be required to get into a \nseparate land lease agreement with the concerned authorities.\n#5.8 Licensing of REN projects\nLicenses will be issued to the project developers as per the Electricity service law20 \nfor generation, transmission and distribution of electricity from all REN projects above \n100 kW capacity, as well as for their O&M. No licensing will be required for setting up \nor O&M for REN projects less then 100 kW capacity. However, for such projects, \ntechnical oversight will be provided by the ZREC to ensure safety and quality \nstandards of equipment and services. These licensing guidelines will be applicable to \nall REN projects that are being implemented on behalf of any Ministry, utility, donor or any other entity.\n#5.9 Renewable Purchase Obligations\nTo set precedence and a good example, private utility (DABS) will be encouraged to \naccept Renewable Purchase Obligations during TERM 1 of AREP, which would be \nmade mandatory to all industrial and commercial consumers of electricity in TERM 2.\n#5.10 Regulatory Department\nThe appropriate regulatory department shall have exclusive jurisdiction on those \nprovisions of this policy which are within its regulatory mandate, especially regarding \nnotification of electricity tariffs for sale for power; power purchase agreements; \nwheeling, banking, distribution, and transmission loss charges; facilities for \ntransmission of REN electricity; and sharing of purchase of power amongst \ntransmission and distribution licensees. Compliance of guidelines, directives, \nregulations, rules etc. issued by the regulatory authority from time to time regarding \nthese shall be binding on all.\n#6.0 Financing Mechanisms for REN\n6.1 In order to support the subsidy requirements and the incentives to the \nprivate sector, adequate funds would be required which will be created by pooling\u0002in government budgetary resources and donor funds. These funds will be ring\u0002fenced and managed through mechanism of \u201cbasket funds\u201d which will provide the \nfoundation block for setting up a dedicated REN financing institution in future\n6.2 Global experience has shown the catalytic role played by REN specific \nfinancing mechanisms and access to finance, particularly by local entrepreneurs in \npromoting REN sector. Afinancial institution dedicated to REN will be set up during \nTERM 2 that will provide customized financial support to all REN projects to private \nsector, local enterprises, NGOs, women led REN businesses and others. It will pool \nin funds from the government resources, as well as from donors and international \nfinancial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank, Islamic Development \nBank, World Bank etc. The preparation and the work required for setting up this \nnew institution will be taken up in TERM 1.\n6.3 Considering the fact that REN projects facilitate the adaptation and mitigation \nmeasures of climate change, they are eligible for benefitting from several funds \ndedicated for such purposes. All implementing agencies of REN projects, both in \npublic and private sector, will explore receiving of climate funds to increase the \nviability of their projects during design and development stage itself.\n#7.0 Capacity Assessment and Enhancement for Stakeholders\n7.1 The REN sector has grown impressively at the global level and new tools and \ntechniques are routinely being used to plan, design, implement and monitor REN \nprojects. While REN is not new to Afghanistan and several projects are operational \nand under construction, it is prudent to recognize and acknowledge that the \ncapacities, both systemic and human, of Afghan institutions dealing with REN have \nto be brought at a level where they can absorb and be benefitted from the \n7.0 CAPACITY ASSESSMENT AND ENHANCEMENT\nFOR STAKEHOLDERSrecognize that existing institutions may need to be reorganized and new institutions \nmay need to be established for effective implementation of AREPin both its terms.\n7.2 A comprehensive capacity enhancement program at the institutional level \nwould be designed and executed during TERM 1. This will include identification of \nstakeholders and their current and future role and an assessment of their capacity \nneeds aligned to these roles; design and delivery of generic, specific and \ncustomized capacity enhancement program, and their monitoring and assessment \nframeworks. This would also include identification of partner training institutions, \nboth within and outside of Afghanistan, particularly in the region, creating semi\u0002formal and formal platforms for networking and cross-learning and facilitation of \nexchange visits for both trainee and trainers.\n7.3 Networking with other organizations working in the field of REN energy such \nas ECO, SAARC, IRENA, etc. for transfer of knowledge would be facilitated.\nRenewable energy technologies have inherent characteristics of intermittencies and \nseasonal variations, and therefore, utmost care has to be taken in their deployment \nfor getting the maximum output through efficient designs and use of quality \nequipment. A robust quality control mechanism is required to ensure the above. \nTherefore, the development/ adoption of quality standards, testing, certification and \naccreditation would be taken up on priority in association with ANSA as well as with \nother national and international institutions. Guidelines for product performance and \nreliability would also be developed and institutionalized in consultation with all \nrelevant stakeholders. An award and recognition framework for different categories \nwould be formulated and institutionalized in appropriate departments and institutions \ni.e. at school level, university level, conferences, industry associations and others. \n#8.0 Standards, Benchmarks for Performance and Quality Control\nRenewable energy technologies have inherent characteristics of intermittencies and \nseasonal variations, and therefore, utmost care has to be taken in their deployment \nfor getting the maximum output through efficient designs and use of quality \nequipment. A robust quality control mechanism is required to ensure the above. \nTherefore, the development/ adoption of quality standards, testing, certification and \naccreditation would be taken up on priority in association with ANSA as well as with \nother national and international institutions.

An award and recognition framework for different categories \nwould be formulated and institutionalized in appropriate departments and institutions \ni.e. at school level, university level, conferences, industry associations and others. \nUse of standards would be made mandatory for all REN projects.\n#9.0 Support for local Manufacturing Assembly, Repair & Maintenance\nA strong local industry for manufacture, assembly, installation and servicing would be \nrequired to sustain the REN sector in Afghanistan in future. A two pronged strategy \nwould be adopted to create and support a local REN industry. On one hand, a cadre of \nentrepreneurs would be created through technical and vocational training given by \nVocational Training Centre (VTC) of MEW to support the REN sector. This activity \nwould be undertaken in coordination with of Ministries of Education and Higher \nEducation and would involve integrating REN specific education and skill \ndevelopment as a part of curricula at the level of schools, technical colleges, \nuniversities, institutions of engineers and architects, among others. Simultaneously, \nnewly created and existing REN enterprises would be strengthened through a slew of \nincentives and support mechanisms such as access to start \u2013up finance and working \ncapital, incubation of innovative ideas, enhanced skill based training, favorable tax \nregime, etc. to make them competitive and self-sustaining.\nDuring the course of development of REN sector, a wealth of knowledge is created \nthat is relevant in improving the design and delivery of REN projects and program, \nscale-up strategies, mid-course modifications if required, as well as to set the \nfoundation of accountability and responsibility. Several formal and informal \nmechanisms such as dialogues, networking, and workshops help in creating and \nmanaging this knowledge. Monitoring and evaluation counts as one of the important \nmechanisms. The framework for monitoring, evaluation and periodic review of AREP\nas well as for various REN projects will be put in place using international expertise in \nM&E and related fields. The assessment and reviews would be done internally as well\nas by third parties, including NGOs and experts.\nASSEMBLY, REPAIR & MAINTENANCE\n#10.0 Monitoring, Evaluation, and Knowledge Management\nDuring the course of development of REN sector, a wealth of knowledge is created \nthat is relevant in improving the design and delivery of REN projects and program, \nscale-up strategies, mid-course modifications if required, as well as to set the \nfoundation of accountability and responsibility.

The assessment and reviews would be done internally as well \nas by third parties, including NGOs and experts.\n#11.0 User Training and Awareness Creation\nEmpowering the user and other stakeholders with information and knowledge on \nvarious aspects of REN including its benefits, characteristics, applications etc. will \nhave a lasting impact on its acceptance and right usage. Sensitization and awareness \ngeneration program have proven to be effective in enhancing the uptake of RETs \nglobally. RED of MEW will work closely with donor agencies, NGOs and other \ninstitutions to promote such program across the country.\n#12.0 Involvement of Women and Supply and Demand Side of REN Projects\nWomen are not only the beneficiaries of RETs, they have also played an important \nrole in managing businesses and program to sell/ promote RETs across the world. \nThe example of Solar Sister in Africa, Barefoot college and Lighting a Billion Lives in \nIndia are some of the success stories of women led REN enterprises. Apilot program \non supporting women led REN enterprises would be launched to facilitate \ninvolvement of women in REN. In addition, they will also be trained for conducting \nsensitization and awareness generation program.\n#13.0 Integrating Environment and Energy Efficiency with REN\nRenewable energy being an environmentally benign sector, its role in facilitating low \ncarbon growth of a country's economy in Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions \n(NAMA) needs to be recognized and acknowledged at all levels of decision making \nand planning for energy sector including its positive relationship with climate change \nissues. This will ensure the integration of REN into mainstream energy sector. \nFurther, REN also needs to be integrated with energy efficiency (EE) at all levels of \nproject cycle (i.e. project conceptualization, designing, and implementation) to \nmaximize its benefits. In order to promote this integration, it would be necessary to \nencourage adoption of EE practices and measures in REN projects. Some of these \npractices would be labeling of appliances on EE benchmarks, energy audits of \nbuildings/ establishments and adoption of EE practices prior to installing RETs, rating\nof buildings/establishments, passive architecture, among others.\n"}
