electricity sector However, energy access continues to be an imposing\nchallenge for the government While Afghanistan is building up its domestic\ngeneration capacity, it becomes imperative to integrate energy efficiency\nprinciples within Afghanistan\u2019 energy policy landscape in order to best utilize\nthe scarce energy resources, and reduce costs in the long term The Ministry of\nEnergy and Water (MEW), as one of the key ministries to plan and direct the\ndevelopment of energy sector in Afghanistan, has now prepared the Afghanistan\nEnergy Efficiency Policy (AEEP) which aims to provide direction to the energy\nefficiency activities in the country The scope of AEEP covers all sectors on the\nenergy value chain being extraction, transformation, transmission and\ndistribution and end use The AEEP will be implemented in two terms, TERM1 and\nTERM , to achieve its strategic and policy goals TERM  (2017 \u2013 2020) will work\nto create enabling environment for the establishment of an energy efficiency\nindustry in Afghanistan TERM  () will be working to enable transition of the\nenergy efficiency industry from  government led activity to  private investment\nled marketplace The Office of Energy Efficiency (OEE), proposed to be created\nwithin the Ministry of Environment and Water (MEW), will have primary\nresponsibility for strategizing, planning, budgeting and coordinating the\nimplementation of AEEP  committee headed by deputy minister of MEW and\ncomprising of relevant stakeholders will be responsible of creating OEE The OEE\nwill work with  range of public and private sector representative institutions\nto achieve its objectives and will develop into an independent decision making\nauthority on EE in the long term Salient features of the Policy are:       The\nobjective of the policy is to adopt an integrated approach to harness all\nresources on the supply side while applying good demand side management\npractices in all energy consuming sectors The policy sets targets for reducing\nlosses in extraction, generation, transmission & distribution and end use and\npromotes identification and adoption of energy efficiency opportunities across\nall sectors of the economy through awareness creation and capacity building It\nseeks leadership from the public sector to adopt energy efficiency practices by\nsetting measurable targets across  range of activities and operations It\nadvocates for the government to provide resources for business leadership to\nenable them embrace and lead energy efficiency objectives The policy encourages\nhouseholds and small to medium enterprises businesses to reduce costs by\nimproving access to energy efficiency projects through technology and financing\nIt seeks to strengthen consumer awareness in order to empower them make informed\nchoices for energy efficient purchasing viii    It supports setting up minimum\nand acceptable standards across  range of options \u2013 minimum energy performance\nscheme for appliances, energy efficiency rating schemes for buildings, minimum\nrenewable energy integration targets for new developments - with the help of\nlegislations Policy acknowledges the need to create knowledge base and standards\nto support development of high quality of energy technologies and modern energy\nefficiency industry It encourages use of renewable energy as generation and\ndemand side management as well as fuel diversification option It uses existing\npartnership platforms with other countries to exchange energy efficiency ideas,\nprojects, finance and innovation It lays the foundation for setting up \u201cbasket-\nfunds\u201d for EE projects which would evolve into  dedicated EE financing\ninstitution in TERM  of the policy implementation It recognizes the importance\nof institutional strengthening and possible reorganization, including setting up\nof new institution for strategizing, planning, budgeting and coordinating the\nimplementation ix  CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND  Context       Afghanistan is\ncurrently experiencing an economic growth rate of sub % per annum, and expected\nto continue moving north1 The country also continues to experience  consistently\nhealthy population growth of approximately % per annum over the last few years\nThe combined effect of its population and economic growth is putting an upward\npressure on annual energy demand, and is expected to continue in the coming\nyears Even as Afghanistan is rich in energy resources, years of political\ninstability has led to under investment in creation of infrastructure required\nfor extraction, refinement, generation, transmission and distribution of energy\nservices These assets are critical in delivering  nation\u2019 objective of creating\nan equal opportunity, stable and prosperous society As an outcome of this\nhistoric instability, the nation has been facing chronic challenges in providing\nenergy access to all of its citizens, as well as developing its own energy\nsecurity Over the last decade, Afghanistan has made significant reconstruction\nefforts at all levels of the energy supply chain, in particular, the electricity\nsector As  consequence, electricity now reaches 30% population in 2016, compared\nto only % population in 2007, an increase of 23% in almost  decade3 This change\nhas been  direct result of the reforms carried out by the federal government,\nwhich has prioritized providing energy supply to every user as one of its\nnational objectives Even with such impressive results, energy access continues\nto be an imposing challenge for the government Afghanistan has one of the lowest\nper capita electricity consumption in the world and it is mostly attributed to\nunavailability of both electricity and reliable electricity to  large number of\nAfghan populations Moreover, only around  third of the Afghan population has\naccess to electricity of which  majority stays in the urban areas Kabul alone\naccounting for 80% of the connected load Also to note is Afghanistan\u2019 energy end\nuse distribution, which is quite unique in global context While industries\naccount for  majority share in world\u2019 energy end use statistics in 2014, this\nspot is occupied by residential sector (73%) in Afghanistan It is indicative of\nan economy, where with favorable global and internal conditions, high rate of\ngrowth can be achieved thus  corresponding increase in demand for energy Energy\nefficiency, thus becomes  priority focus area for policy makers to reduce\npressure on scarce energy resources The rural communities, which account for\nabout 73% of the total population4, are still in the process of getting\nconnected to the grid This energy access wedge between urban and rural\ncommunities is further exacerbated by unavailability of clean fuel in the rural\nareas According to the available statistics, more than 97% of the rural\npopulation use solid fuels ( firewood, dung cakes, crop residues) for combustion\nto meet their cooking and space heating needs, usually in inefficient devices5\nThis practice creates adverse outcomes for health of rural communes, in\nparticular, women and children           Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy\nThe energy access challenge also emanates from the situation that Afghanistan is\nstill building up its domestic generation capacity Currently, it is heavily\nreliant on electricity imports, which is as high as 60% of the total installed\ncapacity6This brings home another issue of concern for Afghanistan in the form\nof energy security, which also stretches to other primary energy sources\nincluding oil and gas In 2014, nearly 97% of the country\u2019 oil needs were\nimported7 Lack of investments in gas production and transmission infrastructure\nhas restricted development of identified gas reserves On other hand, large scale\nconstruction activity and increasing number of transport vehicles in Afghanistan\nis resulting in an increase in demand of petroleum products As an example, motor\nvehicles per 1000 people were added to Afghanistan roads in the years between\n2006 and 2011 creating additional demand for barrels of oil in that period8\nGiven the above set of circumstances, investment in increasing the number of\npower stations, oil and gas extraction, transmission and distribution networks\ncertainly becomes  high priority activity for Afghanistan However, energy\nacquisition and distribution being  scarce and costly resource, it becomes\nequally important to minimize losses at each step of the energy supply chain,\nstarting from production, distribution to end use at consumer level It therefore\nbecomes imperative to integrate energy efficiency principles within Afghanistan\u2019\nenergy policy landscape Energy value chain Losses occur during energy\ntransformation, transmission distribution and at end consumer use level The\nstrategic intent of an energy policy is to reduce these losses across entire\nenergy value chain, using technical, procedural and behavioral interventions\nEnergy efficiency is about doing more for less Each unit of energy which is\nsaved by efficient use translates into  unit of energy not required to be\nproduced The flow on effects are reduction in carbon emissions, outdoor and\nindoor pollution and at  larger scale, avoidance of building new power\nassessed August 2016 & Energy Sector Status Summary Report Q2 2016- MoEC/ICE\nMotor vehicles include cars, buses, and

to\nadditional demand created by inefficient use Therefore, energy efficiency\nbecomes an important piece in addressing energy access and energy security\nchallenges Energy efficiency signifies around 40 percent of the GHG reduction\npotential globally that can be realized9 Many nations have put emphasis on\nenergy efficiency measures to stimulate their faltering economies One of the\nobjectives of Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) - to double the global rate of\nimprovement of energy efficiency \u2013 also reflects the global agenda of tapping\nenergy efficiency market Enhancing energy efficiency was one of the major focal\npoint of the Paris climate agreement made in December Adoption of energy\nefficiency measures and practices such as enforcement of building energy codes,\nmandatory minimum energy performance standards for appliances, taxes incentive\nand penalties to encourage use of energy efficient appliances, motor vehicles,\nenergy efficient lighting in domestic, commercial, industrial and transport\nsectors have shown to reduce the intensity of energy demand without compromising\non socio-economic growth For instance,  economic output expanded more than three\ntimes since 1970 while demand for energy grew only 50% According to IEA, total\nworldwide outlay in EE was USD 221 billion in 2015, an increase of % from The\nefficiency gains have been greatly led by policy and there are huge potential\nlying in regions where policy is absent or inadequate The National Energy Policy\nof Afghanistan and Afghanistan Renewable Energy Policy advocates energy\nefficiency to be integrated at all level of project cycle to maximize its\nbenefits Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), which focuses on\nreducing emissions and contributing to sustainable development, has also listed\nEE as one of the main priorities It recommended establishment of institutional\nframework, drafting of policy and guidelines, identification of low cost and\nhigh return options for implementation of energy efficiency and target of\nmeeting 100 GWh saving  Background Energy efficiency as an area of focus has\nbeen  relatively new concept in Afghanistan Currently, Energy Efficiency (EE)\nUnit within the Ministry of Energy and Water coordinates and implements energy\nefficiency works  few of the significant milestones marking important\ndevelopments in progression of energy efficiency as  mainstream activity in the\ncountry has been discussed below  Background Paper on Energy Efficiency (2012):\nThe energy efficiency background paper (2012) was perhaps the first such study\ndone to identify energy saving potential in Afghanistan Scope of this paper was\nlimited to demand side electrical energy efficiency The overall approach towards\nintegrating energy efficiency within Afghanistan\u2019 energy landscape was proposed\nin three distinct terms, including, short term (- years), long term (- years)\nand continued reforms (+ years) In the short term, the priority was to undertake\nenergy saving projects which reliable and already available, while in the longer\nterm, institutional reforms would be undertaken to develop an investor friendly\nmarketplace The paper examined  number of potential technical and policy\nsolutions for improving demand side efficiency in the country, further\nshortlisted into seven programs to be  Energy efficiency:  compelling global\nresource - McKinsey & Company 10 The History of Energy Efficiency, Alliance\nCommission on National Energy Efficiency Policy, January 2013 11 Afghanistan\nEnergy Efficiency Policy  implemented as priority, and included the following:\nAwareness campaign, Urban re-lamping program to replace incandescent based\nlighting with CFL, dissemination of solar water heater, Load management, large\nelectric motor efficiency programs, improving building envelop performance and\ndevelopment of Afghan energy services industry Suggestions for longer term\nreforms included setting electricity pricing and tariffs to encourage actions to\nsave energy, capacity building of institutions and industry, nationwide\nimprovement in power quality, norms and standards for household appliances, data\ncollection processes for monitoring and evaluation of projects, and financing\nmechanisms, incentives, legislations and regulations, Energy Audits: Energy\naudit surveys were conducted at 12 of the government run facilities across Kabul\n(), Nangarhar (), and Herat () in the year of These audits included collection\nof energy consumption data from the buildings, recommend measures to reduce\nenergy consumption and provide financial analysis of the measures based on\nenergy savings These projects have been conducted as \u201cdemonstration\u201d projects in\nthe country The main objective of the demonstration projects was to set up\nsystem through which people and utilities can see tangible results from\nefficient use of electricity and define the degree of possible potentials\nsavings for future intervention Some of the typical recommendations which were\ncross cutting for the 11 facilities included: \uf0b7 Replacement of Incandescent\nbulbs with CFLs \uf0b7 Replacement of CFLs with LEDs \uf0b7 Replacement of Fluorescent\nlights with lower power rated fluorescent lights \uf0b7 Halogen/Mercury Vapor lamp\nwith LEDs \uf0b7 Use of energy efficient Variable Refrigerant Flow Air-conditioning\nunits \uf0b7 Replacement of Higher Capacity Air-conditioners with lower capacity Air-\nconditioners \uf0b7 Replacement of electric water heaters/boilers with solar water\nheaters/boilers \uf0b7 Electromagnetic chokes with electronic chokes \uf0b7 Training and\ncapacity building of building maintenance staff Readiness Survey: In 2016,\nreview of the existing energy efficiency policy landscape was done in\nAfghanistan, with  view to identify potential gaps in effective promotion of\nenergy efficiency and present next steps to create an energy efficiency policy\nfor focused development of this area The exercise involved one to one survey and\nconsultations with respondents from government, household, commercial and\nindustry The output of this work identified lack of awareness and high cost of\nenergy efficient products as main barriers in adoption of energy efficiency\npractices Motivating factors as cited by the respondent to be considered in\nfuture policy included personal responsibility and financial saving as the key\ndrivers for change Support was sought from the government in education and\nawareness, tighter regulations, access to qualified advice and availability of\ngrants to support projects Stakeholder Consultation: It was also observed that\ndespite recent efforts, development of energy efficiency sector in the country\nis yet to commence on  noticeable scale Outcomes from stakeholder consultations\nidentified energy efficiency an embryonic subject matter for policy makers as\nwell as wider population, resulting in various levels of challenges in bringing\nabout necessary changes in social and institutional landscape to push through\nthe energy efficiency reforms Some of the challenges that have constrained this\nchange include lack of institutional capacity to implement energy efficiency\nactivities, inadequate systems and processes to capture data which Afghanistan\nEnergy Efficiency Policy     prohibits measuring and evaluation of energy\nefficiency interventions, development of energy management tools such as\nintensity indicators or accounting of country\u2019 energy balance Other important\ngaps were identified in form of lack of budgetary support; well-defined roles\nand responsibilities for ministries and departments and poor awareness level\namong general public & institutions  Review of six EE Policies: Through  desktop\nresearch of energy efficiency policies from six countries (Australia, China,\nGermany, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan), it was observed that some of the features\nof  well working framework include promotion and adoption of energy efficiency\nacross sectors through various institutions and measures Establishment of energy\nefficiency agency was acknowledged in almost all the policies as  necessary\ninstrument to foster the implementation of EE policies Regulations like energy\nlabeling and standards have proven effective in lowering energy consumption of\nspecific appliances and equipment and to speed up the diffusion of energy-\nefficient equipment in the market Economic incentives aimed at encouraging\ninvestments in energy efficient equipment, buildings and processes by reducing\nthe upfront cost, either directly (financial incentives like subsidies, low\ninterest loans) or indirectly (fiscal incentives like tax reduction) have been\nintroduced in almost all EE policies Due to constraints on government budgets,\npolicies recommended involvement of the private sector in supporting investments\nin energy efficiency, through energy service companies (ESCOs) and energy\nutilities Energy-savings obligations are an innovative measure in which energy\ncompanies have  legal obligation to undertake energy-efficiency activities with\ntheir customers However,  strong institutional setup was required to achieve the\nparticipation of private investors in energy efficiency market   Taking the\nabove into account,  concept paper on Afghanistan energy efficiency sector was\nprepared This paper recommended development of  national energy efficiency\npolicy which would include political and regulatory measures; financial support\nmechanism; awareness creation and technical education for capacity building;\ncreation of market conditions and low-risk business environment to overcome the\nbarriers and create favorable regulatory and institutional environment for\nuptake of EE in Afghanistan The Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy (AEEP) 2016\nis an outcome of  consultative process which includes government and private\nsector The policy is aimed at providing direction to the energy efficiency\nactivities in the country It envisions achieving this through utilizing the\ncollective strength and interdependencies of several stakeholders and government\ndepartments by creating an enabling environment for the development of the\nenergy efficiency sector in Afghanistan The drafting of the AEEP is authorized\nby the Presidential Decree Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy   ENERGY SAVING\nPOTENTIAL     list of possible energy efficiency activities applicable to\nAfghanistan\u2019 context and their respective energy saving potential is provided in\nthis section This list is based on desktop research of publications from several\ncountries including India, France, Thailand, Tajikistan and  2014 report on\nWorld Energy Investment Outlook from the International Energy Association (IEA)\nListing of energy efficiency opportunities is primarily concentrated on areas of\nthe economy using electricity as the energy source; however, observations have\nalso been made for energy efficiency opportunities in other sectors which may\nnot use electricity, for example, agriculture, on high level estimates The list\nis intended to be used as  guide to further investigate and prioritize\nimplementation of energy saving activities specific to Afghanistan for each of\nthe involved sectors As the energy saving opportunities and associated savings\nare indicative and based on desktop research, the actual values may vary once\nthe activities have been implemented  End use/Demand side energy consumption\nIn reference to the electricity end use in Afghanistan, it is important to\nrecognize that after years of instability, the country is currently undergoing\nsignificant reconstruction exercise Among other important programs, efforts to\nprovide access to electricity to every section of population in Afghanistan are\ncurrently underway Currently, electricity access is mostly available to urban\nconsumers For example, the Kabul metropolitan area alone accounts for about 80%\nof the connected load in the country This also highlights the urban versus rural\ndivide the country faces in addressing the energy access challenge  Most of the\nresidential energy goes towards heating and cooling  house, followed by\nappliances, and lighting Even as the above data may not be exactly applicable to\nAfghanistan, it does give  rough indication of the areas where energy is usually\nconsumed  The energy efficiency opportunities which are typically present in\nhousehold sector are listed in the table below These opportunities have been\ncategorized as per the energy end use of the household sector The

efficiency in transportation sector can\nbe achieved broadly through three ways These include improvement in energy\nefficiency of motor vehicles, improvement by shifting the modes of travel or\ngoods transport and improvement by travel demand management The later two are\nlargely achieved through strategic level interventions, such as deployment of\nmass transit systems, use of  mix of transport modes to move people and freight,\ntransport planning integrated with land use planning and measures like\ncongestion tax to alter user behavior to name  few These are typically result of\nlong term planning process and can be carried out at the stages of developing\nblueprints for land use and transport planning for  city or province In\nAfghanistan\u2019 context, improving energy efficiency of motor vehicle may be an\nopportunity which can be achieved in the short term  list of such opportunities\nis provided in the following table This list is focused on achieving energy\nefficiency through technical improvements which may be possible within new\nvehicles Some opportunities, such as low resistance tire and automatic start and\nstop function can be  retrofit to older vehicles As data for type of fuels and\nend use of energy within the transportation sector is not available, an\nassumption was made that petrol and diesel are the most used forms of transport\nfuel, and  majority of this fuel is consumed within the road transport sector,\nincluding freight and passenger vehicle Railways, flight, defense vehicle and\nwater based transport has been excluded from the list of suggestion for the\nenergy efficiency activities These can be added at  later stage as the knowledge\nand understanding of the aforementioned sector increases with improved data\ncollection

tractors Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy 11 As\nlike the transport sector,  list of suggestions for energy efficiency activities\nfor agricultural sector is provided below These suggestions will expand and\nimprove at  later iteration of the policy as knowledge and understanding of the\nagriculture sector increases with improved data collection Energy Efficiency\nOpportunities in Agriculture

farm have not been included An example of this would\nbe reducing use of chemical fertilizer in the fields to collectively reduce the\ndemand on imports/manufacturing, thereby reducing upstream energy consumption\nwithin the economy  Electricity transformation/generation side Opportunities for\nenergy efficiency in the electricity generation/transformation segment are\ntypically challenging for the existing power plants as they are technically\nlimited due  complex inter-related design, operation and maintenance issues,\nincluding technology choice, loading constraints and fuel availability Moreover,\nabout 60% of Afghanistan\u2019 electricity demand is catered by imports, thus\nlimiting the opportunities to make changes in the power generator fleet However,\nas the energy generation sector matures overtime, and at some stage into the\nfuture, data on current efficiency levels are available, legislative or market\nbased incentives can be provided to generation asset operators to bring the\npower generation fleet closer towards best practice efficiency levels Studies\nhave demonstrated that even small increments in energy conversion efficiency of\nthe generation technology can yield large number of savings over its life As an\nexample, the following table illustrates savings in fuel and pollution\nreductions by only  % improvement in generation efficiency12 Effect of

energy generation continues to become  priority, renewable energy and\nstorage system are increasingly becoming core considerations in creation of new\npower generation assets As an example, In the year 2015, renewable sources (,\nbiomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar, wind) accounted for almost two-thirds\n(85 percent) of the 16,485 MW of new electrical generation placed in service in\nthe United States14 In this case, energy efficiency in renewable based\ngeneration becomes an important topic of consideration However, energy\nefficiency in renewable energy technologies tend to have  range of drivers for\nefficiency, and for dominant technologies such as wind farms or solar PV, fuel\ncosts or CO2 13 Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, 2012,\n\u201cAnalysis of energy

strategies\nwhich provide  high level pathway to achieve these goals The strategies have\nbeen designed to improve EE across sectors and address the barriers to the\nuptake of energy efficiency measures and technologies The strategies are further\nsupported with policy tools which provide action level details required for\nrealization of strategy The strategies and actions have been listed below:\nGreening of building sector Buildings account for about 93% of all electrical\nenergy in Afghanistan and  significant share of greenhouse gas emissions The\nbuilding sector covers  varied set of end use activities, which have different\nenergy use effects As the country develops, energy demand from the building\nsector will continue to increase Thus, energy efficiency in building sector is\nespecially significant owing to rapid new construction with opportunities to\nutilize efficient materials and best practices The policy proposes to set\nperformance targets on new and old public & private buildings The goals are set\non  TERM  timeframe, and will require creation of legal and institutional\nframework to deliver on these changes The specific actions are as follows: \uf0b7\nEnforce Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Codes for Building (AEEC) in all new\nbuildings: Building Code sets requirements for the energy performance of\nbuildings New buildings designed and constructed on recommended measures of AEEC\nwill save significant amounts of money over  building' life Afghanistan energy\nefficiency codes for buildings (AEEC) must be aggressively enforced for the new\nconstructions to follow best practices The policy sets  target of ; 100% of all\nnew construction above 2000m2 of NLA, both for private and public sector, will\nbe required to be rated under AEEC \uf0b7 Introduce green building rating systems:\nGreen rating system provides  scale to measure the sustainability standard of\nbuilding' design, construction and operation Through each criteria and sub\ncriteria, rating system evaluates the performances of the building and award\nrating Buyers favor energy efficient buildings which guarantee reduced life\ncycle costs ; Introduce an operational building rating system suitable for all\nclasses of buildings within Afghanistan ; 100% of all buildings in use above\n1000m2 of NLA, both for private and public sector, will be required to be rated\nunder green building rating system \uf0b7 Energy efficient lighting in public and\nprivate buildings: All public buildings can realize significant cost savings and\nreduced energy use by choosing energy efficient lighting Making the switch to\nenergy efficient lighting is  good way to get started on becoming more energy-\nefficient, since it typically has such  short payback period The policy has put\ntarget of ; 100% of incandescent, halogen and old generation fluorescent based\nlighting to be phased out and replaced with LEDs or other best available\ntechnology in homes and other buildings \uf0b7 Retrofitting of old buildings: Since\nmany households, private offices, factories and public building have been\nconstructed in earlier times and typically contain inefficient appliances,\nbuilding envelop as well Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy 18 as\ntechnologies, it is beneficial for the owners of these buildings to retrofit\nthem with newer and more efficient appliances and technologies, and where\nfeasible, building envelop and insulation While government owned buildings tend\nto be easier and more practical to enforce to undertake  retrofit project, it is\nsuggested that commercial, residential and industrial building owners shall also\nbe encouraged to undertake energy efficiency improvements in their buildings by\nway of financial incentives Policy proposes  target for retrofit buildings as\nfollows: ; 30% of NLA of government buildings, including factories built on or\nbefore 2016 must have had energy efficiency upgrades ; 30% of NLA of private\nbuildings, including factories built on or before 2016 must have voluntarily\nundergone energy efficiency upgrades  Public lighting The potential for energy\nsavings from making public lighting more energy efficient can be substantial and\nrelatively simpler to achieve Public lighting may account for as high as 30% -\n50% of the overall energy expenditure of  municipality, depending on asset base\nAdoption & promotion of best available technologies like LEDs/HIDs or solar\npowered lights for public lighting could also help, apart from reduction in\nelectricity, break down barriers for adoption of energy efficient lighting in\nother sectors The policy suggests following targets: ; Energy efficiency of\npublic lighting assets further improved from 2016 levels with use of best\navailable technologies such as the LEDs or low energy HIDs ; 50% of the public\nlighting assets in areas with good solar access to be powered with solar energy\nAppliances & equipment Energy consumed by residential appliances and industrial\nand commercial equipment is  major source of greenhouse gas emissions globally\nThe Strategy includes  range of measures aimed at increasing the energy\nefficiency of appliances used in the residential, commercial and industrial\nsectors Following action items have been proposed under this strategy: \uf0b7 Energy\nperformance standards are the most widely used measures globally to reduce\nenergy use and greenhouse gas emissions from appliances and equipment Minimum\nEnergy Performance Standards (MEPS) provide consumer protection in  higher\nenergy price context by ensuring that inefficient appliances are not available\nin the market The policy sets the following target: ; 100% of all new appliances\nand equipment manufactured or imported in Afghanistan to meet minimum energy\nperformance and quality standards \uf0b7 Energy efficiency labelling assists\nconsumers by providing information, allowing them to make coherent choices\nhaving regard to likely life cycle costs It acts as an incentive for\nmanufacturers to set apart from their competitors and promote introduction of\nnew and efficient versions The following target has been set: ; 100% of all new\nappliances and equipment manufactured or imported in Afghanistan to meet energy\nefficiency labelling Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy 19  Transport sector\nMost of the oil in Afghanistan is imported, which exposes the country to\nunstable international oil prices Deployment of advanced technologies and\nalternative fuel vehicles can reduce use of imported oil resources in transport\nsector Measures to improve energy efficiency in transport contribute not only to\ndecrease in fuel consumption, but also to the reduction in CO2 emissions The\npolicy intends to introduce following action items for this strategy: \uf0b7 Vehicle\nlabelling helps customers to understand and compare vehicle choices on the basis\nof fuel economy and CO2 emission level displayed on vehicles This enables\nconsumers to view the features of other vehicles that they might not have\notherwise considered The policy puts the following target: ; 100% of all new\nvehicles manufactured or imported in Afghanistan to meet green labeling\nrequirement based on kgCO2/km performance ; The efficiency of light and heavy\nvehicles entering the fleet has further improved from 2016 levels \uf0b7 Alternative\nfuel vehicles: Options for alternative fuel vehicles - from electric cars to\nnatural gas-powered buses and trucks that run on biodiesel - are increasingly\nbecoming available Increasing the fleet of alternative fuel vehicles in the\nAfghanistan economy will help reduce oil imports and also reduce pollution The\nfollowing target have been set under this action ; 10% of all new light and\nheavy vehicles entering the fleet must be based on EV and alternative fuel\ntechnology  Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity Electricity\nand gas networks play  key role in the achievement of sustainable development It\nis therefore equally important, like the demand side sectors, to incorporate\nenergy efficiency in network design and operations of the existing and new power\ngeneration fleet in Afghanistan The policy recommends following targets to drive\nthe operations of generator feet and & network towards more energy efficient\noutcomes, based on the existing scenario \uf0b7 100% of power plants to monitor and\nreport on their operating efficiency performance \uf0b7 100% of power plants to meet\nthe efficiency standards observed in average high efficiency performing power\ngeneration assets \uf0b7 The transmission and distribution losses in government run\nenergy & assets to get in step with global best practices from 2016 levels\nCurrently it is around 28% with an aim to reduce to 10% in  Mining, oil & gas\nextraction Mining and extraction industries tend to be the most energy use\nintensive sectors within an economy They also tend to be the most complex to\nmanage as they come with  range of technologies which are applied based on\nspecific needs of  mining or extraction process, geology and technique However,\nnumber of technologies used within the processing stages can be made more\nefficient with help of low-cost measures, optimization of production processes,\nand reliability of electric power supply Taking the above into account, the\npolicy suggests the following: Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy 20 \uf0b7 100% of\nall process operations and equipment built before 2016 retrofitted with\nefficient motors, pumps, compressor, turbines and heat recovery systems \uf0b7 100%\nof new purchased or leased vehicle fleet to meet fuel efficiency standards \uf0b7 10%\nof new purchased or leased fleet vehicles to have automated driverless systems\nfor optimized fuel efficiency  Supporting Businesses, Enterprises & Commercial\nEstablishments Participation of private sector is critical in ensuring success\nof new markets and programs such as the energy efficiency, and in cases like\nthose similar to current status of Afghanistan, government leadership is deemed\ncritical in starting and catalyzing  new market  mix of incentives, knowledge\nand price signals are often used to guide development of the energy efficiency\nindustry As the market mature with help of consistent and good quality\ninformation, reliable projects and verifiable savings, the government\u2019 role as\nregulator and enforcer takes centre stage The following policy measures are\nsuggested to be used in Afghanistan to initiate and promote energy efficiency\nchoices in private industry \uf0b7 Subsidize distribution of technologies with high\nenergy savings, energy security outcomes, for example \u2013 LED lights, insulation\nproducts, solar hot water systems, star rated air-conditioners, space heaters\nand solar PV systems \uf0b7 Provide smart meters and trusted information to reduce\nenergy use at consumer level \uf0b7 Design energy tariff schemes which influence\nconsumer behaviors to switch to more energy efficient practices \uf0b7 Work with\npublic sector and private sector financial institutions to provide loans for\nenergy upgrades or solar PV system installation as part of home and business\nloans \uf0b7 Subsidize access to energy auditors and green building practitioners at\nzero or low cost to uncover opportunities \uf0b7 Provide low interest loans,\nsubsidies to implement energy efficiency, alternative fuels and renewable\ngeneration opportunities \uf0b7 Start voluntary energy and carbon disclosure schemes\nfor organizations which are in top 50 energy consuming organizations in\nAfghanistan \uf0b7 Provide financial and fiscal incentives for organisations to\nencourage retrofitting of old buildings to improve energy efficiency and\nconstruction of new buildings to be rated under Afghanistan Green Building\nDesign Standards \uf0b7 Create knowledge sharing platforms for SMEs, transport,\nagriculture and other sectors to raise awareness and vision \uf0b7 Build management\ncapability, including in SMEs, through training and certification courses to\nidentify and exploit opportunities to ensure energy efficiency good practice is\nreflected in mainstream business planning \uf0b7 Initiate green awards to recognize\nand celebrate efforts, and encourage industry engagement Afghanistan Energy\nEfficiency Policy 21  Consumer awareness Empowering consumers with information\nand knowledge on various aspects of energy efficiency practices including tools,\nprocedures, and benefits is likely to have  long term impact on them accepting\nand supporting an energy efficiency campaign Resulting changes in behavior of\nend user of energy in form of energy conservation, lifestyle, awareness, low-\ncost actions, and small investments can lead to % to 10% in energy savings at\nhousehold or workplace level Following measures will be used to educate public\non the subject and choices of energy efficiency: \uf0b7 Information campaigns at\nplaces of national and international importance including religious institutions\ncan be implemented with an objective of demonstrating integration of energy\nefficiency and its related benefits to create awareness of energy efficiency\npractices & technologies and also to implement energy efficiency at such\nlocations \uf0b7 Regional information centre located at non-government organizations\nand consumer/ industry associations can serve as focal points for disseminating\ninformation on energy efficiency as well as renewable energy to various target\ngroups - from the general public to small and medium-sized enterprises and\npolicy makers \uf0b7 Guidance documents providing information and guidance to help\nconsumers identify energy efficiency opportunities in their processes &\nequipment and also provide relevant details to implement basic energy efficiency\nmeasures can be disseminated among general public, SMEs, Government & commercial\ninstitutions \uf0b7 Public campaign through television programs and newspaper\nadvertisements to reach out to home owners, the public sector and commercial\nenterprises propagating energy efficiency benefits and encouraging energy saving\nbehavior The objectives are to induce  change in the users\u2019 behavior by creating\nawareness of energy use and interest in its reduction \uf0b7 Energy Efficiency\nInformation Website can be established and maintained through office of energy\nefficiency (OEE) which will have comprehensive information on incentives and\npolicies that support energy efficiency in Afghanistan, case studies of\nsuccessful implementation, information on manufacturer of energy efficient\nequipment and guidance documents on energy efficient technologies & practices \uf0b7\nPublicize the results of implemented EE projects through mass media like\ntelevision, newspaper to create awareness among general public This can be\nachieved by integrating communication plan within the project planning stage,\nwhere the project proponent will be lead for creating awareness about their own\nproject \uf0b7 Introduce total cost of ownership (TCO) as evaluation criteria in\ngovernment procurement processes, and encourage private sector to adopt it as\nwell The TCO factors in operational costs as well as capital costs when\ninvesting in assets \u2013 the longer term energy savings may be worth  slightly\nhigher upfront cost  Laws and Regulations Success of an energy efficiency\nprogram is highly dependent on the legal and regulatory drivers which are\npresent in the country They provide the first incentives for individuals and\norganizations to act as well as respond to energy efficiency expectations in\nterms of penalties, fines and other regulatory or reporting requirements It is\ntypically followed by creation of  market for products and services which help\nindividuals Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy 22 or organizations meet their\ncompliance needs, as well as save costs on energy use The following steps are\nsuggested to take Afghanistan to the next step on the energy efficiency program\n\uf0b7 Draft and finalize  regulation which provides  legal framework to initiate and\nsupport creation of an energy efficiency industry in Afghanistan \uf0b7 Set up\nminimum and acceptable standards across  range of options \u2013 minimum energy\nperformance scheme for appliances, energy efficiency rating schemes for\nbuildings, minimum renewable energy integration targets for new developments -\nwith the help of legislations \uf0b7 Create fiscal and financial measures in form of\ntax breaks, penalties, low interest loans, lease to provide access to finance\nfor households, government and commercial sectors \uf0b7 Prepare ground for\nintroducing market based energy efficiency certificate cap and trade scheme into\nTERM  by setting up institutional framework for data acquisition, monitoring and\nreporting, user friendly format for energy bills, system to ease financial\ntransactions or incentives and penalties 10 Energy service companies - ESCO ESCO\nor Energy Service Company is  term used to describe  commercial company\nproviding  wide range of energy related services including design and\nimplementation of energy efficiency projects, sourcing of best tariff plans for\ncustomers in  privatized energy market It acts as  project developer for\nimplementing energy conservation measures and shoulder the technical and\nperformance risks associated with  project The company' return is directly\nlinked to the actual energy cost savings While ESCOs are not  policy instrument\nper se, but they are similar to policy tools and an important medium to capture\nenergy efficiency potentials and overcome  number of market barriers Various\nfactors such as enforcement of building codes, consumer awareness, mandatory\nenergy audits and reporting has enabled the development of  successful ESCO\nindustry The following action items, based on literature review of enabling\nfactors in other similarly placed economies, have been proposed for development\nof ESCOs: \uf0b7 Government backed guarantees for ESCOs to improve access to finance\nfor the energy efficiency projects The guarantees can help ESCO secure funds\nfrom domestic financial institutions, or multilateral financing agencies Other\nfinancial support mechanisms may include partial risk guarantees, loan loss\nreserve funds, special purpose funds or interest credits \uf0b7 Creation of dedicated\ngovernment backed financing body for creating basket funds pooling resources\nfrom various channels and used to finance projects dedicated to energy\nefficiency As the ESCO industry matures and the commercial banks are able and\nwilling to engage ESCOs, public loans or funds should be phased out to avoid\nwastage of government subsidies on projects which can be financed by private\nsector \uf0b7 Standardisation of contract procedures and measurement and verification\nprocedures to alleviate the concerns of end-users and the financing community\nregarding reliability of ESCOs Standardisation also improves time and cost\neffectiveness, and promotes competition and transparency (such as in Germany)\nStandard contracts can increase the trust of customers, especially in the public\nsector, and thereby their willingness to engage with ESCO \uf0b7 Accreditation of\nESCOS to ensure quality assurance and building trust in the minds of the\nconsumer regarding their reliability and competence This system is currently in\nplace in the countries with  large Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy 23\nnumber of ESCOs ( accreditation system by the US ESCO association, NAESCO or the\nChinese ESCO association) 11 Knowledge base and standards Lack of good quality\ntrusted information; standardized source of advice and availability of quality\nproducts in the market is one of the key barriers to energy efficiency take up\nTo overcome this barrier, it is recommended that the following steps are\nundertaken as starting point to create and establish  trusted body of knowledge\nwhich will help in initiating and energy efficiency industry These knowledge\nbases can be periodically reviewed and improved upon as the understanding of\nenergy efficiency grows with experience \uf0b7 Create standards for product\nspecifications based on IEC standards but localized to Afghanistan needs \uf0b7\nCreate standards for energy audit and renewable energy based on ISO standards\nbut localized to Afghanistan needs \uf0b7 Create test standards and measurement\nprotocols for appliances and equipment aligned with international standards, to\nassist performance comparisons and benchmarking for products \uf0b7 Create knowledge\nbase and skills for the new energy efficiency industry by introduce school and\nuniversity level curriculum and apprenticeships and exchange programs \uf0b7 Develop\nmanuals, guidelines for adopting advanced technologies and proven energy\nefficiency practices across various sectors \uf0b7 Build capacity of manufacturers,\nimporters and customs to interpret, understand and make decisions on the basis\nof available standards through the means of workshops, publications and best\npractice demonstration 12 Efficient energy for rural communities In the rural\neconomy, domestic household sector is the most prominent energy consumer,\nfollowed by the agricultural sector Lack of access to cleaner fuels in rural\nareas has led to  process of combusting solid fuels in inefficient devices to\nmeet space heating and cooking needs Improved cook stoves instead of traditional\nbiomass cook stoves can ensure efficiency in the use of traditional fuels and\nalso reduce smoke emission and health hazards Following actions are being\nproposed: \uf0b7 Subsidize distribution of energy efficient biomass cooking stoves\nand heaters in rural communities where distributing modern clean fuels like LPG\nis unfeasible \uf0b7 Incentivize use of renewable energy devices through means of low\ninterest loans and subsidies for various end use productive loads such solar PV\nagricultural pumping and drying systems, Solar PV refrigeration, lighting and\nfan systems for shops in rural areas \uf0b7 Source international funds to invest in\nresearch and development of rural specific technologies such as renewable energy\nbased minigrid systems for electricity and fuel, including, solar PV, micro\nhydro, biogas based technologies Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy 24 13\nRenewable energy Energy efficiency and renewable energy are inextricably linked\nin pursuit of  future with sustainable growth with clean energy Lower energy\ndemand from measures to accelerate energy efficiency contributes to increasing\nthe share of renewable energy in generation mix, assuming that renewable energy\nuse will continue to grow The combination of energy efficiency and renewable\nenergy deployment creates  synergy for increasing both the renewable energy\nshare and annual improvements in energy intensity, which collectively reduces\nthe growth in total primary energy supply (TPES),  great outcome for any country\nwhich is highly dependent of imports of energy For the above reasons, the policy\nrecommends the following \uf0b7 Recognize and promote use of renewable energy such as\nSolar PV, Solar thermal, Wind turbines, Hydro, Bio energy (RE) technologies in\ncentralized, distributed and decentralized generation mode as per the Renewable\nEnergy Policy \uf0b7 Incentivize use of renewable energy devices for various end use\napplications such as lighting and fan systems, agricultural pumping systems,\nrefrigeration systems \uf0b7 Promote use of biofuels as alternative to reduce\nconsumption of traditional fossil based transport fuels, thereby reducing their\ndemand \uf0b7 Develop capacity of households, government and industry to make\ndecisions by creating knowledge products on demonstrating interlinkages of RE\nand EE 14 International Co-operation International cooperation refers to  group\nof actions and/or resources exchanged between different countries according to\ntheir own interests and strategies Engaging existing partnership for cooperation\nthrough trade & investment, technology cooperation and capacity building would\nensure development of energy efficiency sector in Afghanistan Specific actions\nunder this strategy are: \uf0b7 Lead or facilitate seminars, conclaves, conferences\nand trade exhibitions of energy efficiency knowledge, products and services \uf0b7\nUtilize existing networking events to promote trade and investment opportunity\nin Afghanistan energy efficiency sector Examples include services, training and\ncapacity building and manufacturing \uf0b7 Create mechanisms for international\npartnerships and collaborative opportunities among domestic stakeholder groups\nfor collective learning and development and transfer of knowledge and technology\nthrough the means of international chairs, colloquiums and workshops Afghanistan\nEnergy Efficiency Policy 25  IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY  Overview    The AEEP will\nbe implemented in two terms, TERM1 and TERM , to achieve its strategic and\npolicy goals TERM  (2017 \u2013 2020) will work to create enabling environment for\nthe establishment of an energy efficiency industry in Afghanistan This will be\nachieved by creating institutions, systems and processes, and establishing\npartnerships and collaborations across  range of government and private industry\nstakeholders to effectively implement the AEEP The energy efficiency industry in\nTERM  will be government led TERM  () will be working to enable transition of\nthe energy efficiency industry from  government led activity to  private\ninvestment led marketplace This will be achieved by gradually removing barriers\nby creating strong legislative framework, skill base, standards, information and\nfungible marketplace for private investors  Institutional Systems    An apex\nregulatory body, the Office of Energy Efficiency (OEE), is proposed to be\ncreated within the Ministry of Environment and Water (MEW) The OEE will have\nprimary responsibility for strategizing, planning, budgeting and coordinating\nthe implementation of AEEP  committee headed by deputy minister of MEW and\ncomprising of relevant stakeholders will have the responsibility of creating OEE\nIt will comprise of individuals having appropriate background and training\nsuited for the job and should demonstrate leadership and professionalism in\ntheir day to day activities The objectives of the proposed OEE include, but are\nnot limited to the following, and are expected to develop further as the\nknowledge and understanding of energy efficiency sector builds up in Afghanistan\n) Formulating and facilitating national programs and action plans that are well\nsuited to the targeted economic sectors for implementation of energy efficiency\npolicy guidelines ) Establishing terms of reference for coordination between\nrelevant government and private stakeholders and ministries and serve as the\ninformation house on energy efficiency ) Work with stakeholders to developing\nsystem and processes for monitoring effective implementation of energy\nefficiency policies ) Engaging, supporting, working and influencing  wide range\nof stakeholders, including public and private organizations with energy\nefficiency responsibilities with means of information, financing, and capacity\nbuilding ) Conceiving training modules and national level certification scheme\nfor energy managers and energy auditors Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy 26\n) Facilitating technical training, awareness generation and capacity building of\nstakeholders across both government and non-government organizations ) Promotion\nof energy efficiency among general public about national programs and action\nplans, energy efficiency measures and their effects ) Source funding\nopportunities working with international aid agencies and development financing\ninstitutions     Presently, there are  range of institutions working in\ndifferent capacities in the energy efficiency sector, and in most cases,\npursuing the aforementioned objectives Their efforts are largely fragmented and\nOEE will consolidate these efforts by providing leadership, resources and\ndirection to the efforts The OEE will work with  range of public and private\nsector representative institutions to achieve its objectives It will allocate\nresponsibilities to the partner institutions based on their established\nstrengths in area of energy efficiency, informed by consultative planning and\ndecision making process These institutions will report to the OEE on an annual\nbasis on policy targets and progress as agreed between the stakeholders It is\nalso recommended that these institutions congregate annually in some form of\norganizational leadership team meetings, to facilitate building of\nunderstanding, confidence, transparency and hence  team culture between them\nThis is important for overall development of an effective organizational\nculture, conducive to large scale change  list of potential government and\nprivate industry institutions which are envisaged to work with the OEE is\nprovided in the following table The institutions have been listed per their\nexisting core deliverables, and their value addition capacity to assist OEE in\ndelivering critical pieces of works for successful implementation of energy\nefficiency policy Institutional Coordination no Institution Required leadership\nin delivering EE policy      OEE (proposed) \uf0b7 Coordinate activities of relevant\ngovernment departments to

including transport long term, it is recommended that the\nenergy efficiency office is allowed to raise revenue through  range of options\nincluding tariffs, taxes, penalties or other financial tools Afghanistan Energy\nEfficiency Policy 28  Financing Mechanism     The OEE is proposed to be\nempowered with  financial wing, which will have the function of sourcing and\nconsolidating funds from both internally from government resources and\nexternally from donor or development institution financing For these purposes,\nthe funds will be managed through mechanism of basket funds which will provide\nthe foundation block for setting up  dedicated energy efficiency financing\ninstitution in longer term, which could even be merged with the renewable energy\nfinancing body Donor funds could be tied to specific program within the \u201cbasket\nfunds\u201d to give some flexibility and accommodate the preferences of donors\nInternational funds can be sourced in essentially in three forms: Low interest\ndebt (Soft loans), Equity or Grant money In Afghanistan\u2019 context, soft loan and\ngrant money are most suitable form of international funding to raise revenue\nFunding can be sourced from  variety of international financial institutions\nsuch as the Asian Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, World Bank, Global\nEnvironmental Facility or Bilateral agencies such as USAID, DFID, GTZ or the BMZ\nInternally, the OEE will need to use existing government machinery to raise\nfunds through fiscal mechanisms such as pollution/green taxes, custom duties,\ntariffs on inefficient equipment This activity will be important in setting up\nthe incentive and disincentive networks within the economy to influence consumer\nbehaviour towards energy efficiency practices The funds raised by the OEE will\nbe used by the means of various financial instruments, which will assist in\ncreation of  government led energy efficiency industry in TERM , while\ntransitioning into  market led industry in TERM  The government led initiative\nin TERM  will be created with the help of the following financial instruments:\nDirect Subsidies, either completely or partly funded to introduce new\ntechnologies to the users such as the LED lights, energy efficient cooking\nstoves, and heating/cooling technologies As the markets become more mature and\nself-sustaining, the subsidy levels decrease over time or they are replaced with\nmarket-based instruments Grants or co-financing can be provided to both\ngovernment and non-government bodies, private organizations and entrepreneurs to\nperform activities related to: \uf0b7 Promotional campaigns for more efficient uses\nof energy, \uf0b7 Education and training programs for professionals performing tasks\nrelated to energy efficiency improvement, \uf0b7 Financial aid for the preparation of\nenergy audits and related project documentation including investment studies, \uf0b7\nFinancial aid for energy efficiency improvement projects Low interest loans\n(Soft loans), where grants or co-financing is not available, especially for SMEs\nor large industries to undertake investment studies and energy efficiency\nimprovement projects Competitive co-financing can be provided for technology\ndemonstration and deployment of new and innovative technology which are not yet\ncommercially attractive investment compared to available and proven alternatives\nThe goal is to demonstrate the project\u2019 features and scalability to make it an\nattractive investment choice for private financers Afghanistan Energy Efficiency\nPolicy 29  Green lease can be provided to resolve challenge faced by tenant and\nowner of  property in terms of investing in improving energy efficiency of\nproperty Energy efficiency loans can be issued to the \u2018building\u2019 instead of\ntenant or the owner The loan is guaranteed by the local or state government and\nloan repayments are collected by the government in form scheduled property taxes\nand paid to the investment body, in this case OEE  Tax breaks can be provided\nthrough reducing import duties/VAT on energy efficient equipment which will\nencourage inflow of efficient equipment in the market Additionally, as energy\nefficiency projects facilitate the adaptation and mitigation measures of climate\nchange, they are eligible for benefitting from several funds dedicated for such\npurposes One such example is the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Even as income from\nGCF approved project is not likely to be  key investment driver, it is capable\nof acting as  catalyst in increasing return on investment, thus providing\nprojects more credibility and facilitating the securing of funds from financial\ninstitutions There are other climate related funds also available For this\npurpose, all implementing agencies of energy efficiency projects, both in public\nand private sector, will explore receiving of climate funds to increase the\nviability of their projects during design and development stage itself In TERM ,\nthe OEE can emphasize of developing electricity or gas markets backed by\nregulations, as seen in developed countries like Australia or Germany The key to\nsuccess of this market is strong regulations, data collection, reporting and\nadvanced IT based information exchange networks, which is the area of focus of\nTERM  of this policy In  market based scheme, an energy efficiency regulation\nbody imposes targets on electricity distribution companies, large energy\nconsumers, or electricity retailers to buy certain amount of energy efficiency\ncertificates from marketplace Failing to do so attracts penalty charges from\ngovernment, which is high enough to discourage such action These energy\nefficiency certificates are created by designated consumer groups such as\nhouseholds, commercial or industrial users saving energy by undertaking energy\nefficiency projects Each of the certificates typically represents  savings of\n1kwh, or  unit of energy The energy efficiency opportunity is typically\nidentified and implemented by an energy services company (ESCO), who also\nhandles the certificate creation and sale process on behalf of consumers\nAfghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy 30  MONITORING & EVALUATION FRAMEWORK\nMonitoring and evaluation framework for energy efficiency policy is proposed to\nbe developed on the both program and policy levels It is intended that the\nframework at policy level would measure statistical changes resulting from\nenergy efficiency improvements applied through the policy  program level\nframework is intended to measure the effectiveness of institutions which will be\nworking with the OEE to deliver high level program and strategies to implement\npolicies  Collection, maintenance and improvement of energy statistics is\ncomplex and reiterative task, but it needs to be started immediately It is\nrecommended that steps are taken to initiate data collection for the following\nlist of energy efficiency indicators as  minimum to monitor statistical changes\nresulting from energy efficiency improvements applied through the policy The\nlist will be reviewed at the end of TERM  with  view to further improve and\nfocus the process as knowledge, understanding and experience of stakeholders\ngrow with
