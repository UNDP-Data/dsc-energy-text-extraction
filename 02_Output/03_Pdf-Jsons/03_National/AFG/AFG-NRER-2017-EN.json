Renewable energy resource with their enormous potential in \nAfghanistan, can successfully be harnessed to meet these two requirements. The \ndevelopment of renewable energy sector is thus a priority area for the Government of \nAfghanistan and all its supporting partners. \nAn important pillar for the RE sector development is the engagement of the private \nsector and financing institutions. The Asian Development Bank through a Technical \nAssistance (TA) has addressed these challenges by way of developing the Roadmap for \nRenewable Energy in Afghanistan which is a strategic document aiming at meeting the \nobjectives of the Afghanistan Renewable Energy Policy and the National Energy Supply \nProgramme. The Roadmap is designed to increase the supply of energy from domestic \nresources; improve energy supply to load centers, provincial capitals, and rural \npopulation; and increase the capacity within the Government to plan and implement \nrenewable energy projects. It includes prioritization of RE technologies and projects, \ndesigning appropriate business models for their implementation and identifying enablers \nfor market development.\nOne of the important outcomes of this TA is the design and development of strategic \nand relevant projects which are trendsetters in their respective domains and their \nimplementation will help in opening markets for different renewable energy \ntechnologies and applications in Afghanistan. These projects are - Daikundi mini-grid, \nKabul roof-top solar, Hisar-E-Shahi industrial park solar project and Farah PV-wind-diesel \nhybrid project. \nI hope that this Roadmap will provide a confidence to the private sector in preparing to \ninvest its resources in supporting the RE sector in Afghanistan.\nEngineer Ali Ahmad Osmani\nMinister of Energy and Water\n#ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS\nAC Alternating Current;\nADB Asian Development Bank;\nAFG Afghanistan;\nAISA Afghanistan Investment Support Agency;\nANDS Afghanistan National Development Strategy ;\nAREU Afghanistan Renewable Energy Union;\nASERD Afghanistan Sustainable Energy for Rural Development;\nASHP Air Source Heat Pump ;\nATC Aggregate Technical & Commercial;\nBMC Billing, Metering and Collection ;\nBOOM Build-Own-Operate-Maintain;\nCAPEX Capital Expenditure ;\nCBO Community Based Organization ;\nCCSAP Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan ;\nCdTE Cadmium-telluride;\nCOAM Conservation Organisation for Afghan Mountain Areas;\nCOP Coefficient of Performance ;\nCPSU Central Public-Sector Undertaking;\nCPV Concentrating PV;\nCSH Concentrating Solar Heat;\nc-Si crystalline Silicon;\nCSO Central Statistics Office ;\nCSO Civil Society Organizations ;\nCSP Concentrating Solar Power;\nCTCN Climate Technology Centre and Network ;\nDABS Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat ;\nDC Direct Current;\nDF Distribution Franchisee;\nDNI Direct Normal Irradiance ;\nDPR Detailed Project Report ;\nDRE Decentralised Renewable Energy;\nECO Economic Cooperation Organization;\nERDA Energy for Rural Development in Afghanistan ;\nESCO Energy Service Companies ;\nESIA Environmental-Social Impacts Assessment ;\nETC Evacuated tube collectors;\nFAO Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations;\nFiT Feed-in-Tariffs;\nFPC Flat-plate collectors;\nFPV Floating PV ;\nGCF Green Climate Fund ;\nGEF Global Environment Facility;\nGHG Greenhouse Gas;\nGIZ Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit ;\nGoI Government of India;\nGoIRA Government of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan ;\nGW Gigawatt;\nHPP Hydro Power Plant;\nICT Information and Communications Technology;\nIDCOL Infrastructure Development Company Limited;\nINDC Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ;\nIPP Independent Power Producer;\nIREDA Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited;\nIRENA International Renewable Energy Agency;\nISA International Solar Alliance;\nkW Kilowatt;\nkWh Kilowatt-hour;\nLFR Linear Fresnel Reflector ;\nMAIL Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock;\nMEW Ministry of Energy and Water;\nMFC Microbial Fuel Cells;\nMFI Microfinance Institutions ;\nMHPs Micro Hydropower Plants ;\nMJ Multi-Junction;\nMNRE Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (India);\nMRRD Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development;\nMW Megawatt;\nMWh Megawatt-hour;\nNAMA Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions;\nNESP National Energy Supply Programme;\nNGO Non-Governmental Organizations;\nNISE National Institute of Solar Energy ;\nNRVA National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment;\nNSP National Solidary Program;\nNZAID New Zealand Aid Programme;\nO&M Operation and maintenance;\nOPEX Operational Expenditure ;\nPCU Power Control Unit;\nPPA Power Purchase Agreement ;\nPPP Public-Private-Partnership;\nPSMP Power Sector Master Plan;\nPTC Parabolic trough collector;\nR&D Research and Development;\nRAGA Rapid Assessment Gap Analysis;\nRE Renewable Energy ;\nRENP Afghanistan Renewable Energy Policy ;\nRESCO Renewable Energy Service Company ;\nRETs Renewable Energy Technologies ;\nSAARC South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation;\nSDGs Sustainable Development Goals ;\nSE4ALL Sustainable Energy for All;\nSECI Solar Energy Corporation of India ;\nSHS Solar Home Systems;\nSHWs Solar Hot Water System;\nSPEED Smart Power for Environmentally-sound Economic Development ;\nSPPD Solar Power Park Developer ;\nSPPs Solar Power Park;\nSPV Solar Photovoltaics;\nSREP Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program;\nSS Standalone Systems;\nT&D Transmission and Distribution \nTES Thermal Energy Storage ;\nTPL Torrent Power Limited ;\nTWh Terawatt-hours;\nVAM Vapor Absorption Machine;\n#THE ROADMAP \nThe Renewable Energy Roadmap for Afghanistan is developed to realize the vision and intent \nof the Renewable Energy Policy (RENP) for Afghanistan that sets a target of deploying 4500 \n\u2013 5000 MW of renewable energy (RE) capacity by 2032 and envisions a transition from donor \ngrant-funded RE projects to a fully-private sector led industry by 2032. \nObjectives and scope\nThe objectives of the Roadmap are three-fold:\n1. To increase the supply of energy by domestic resources \n2. To augment energy services to population and load centres that are either not served \nor are poorly served \n3. To enhance energy access to remote rural population for their livelihood needs \nThe scope of the Roadmap includes an estimation of technology specific achievable targets \nbased on RE potential that has already been mapped and segregated region-wise. \nTechnologies utilizing solar, wind, biomass, hydro and geothermal resources are considered\nfor this purpose. The Roadmap comprises of prioritization of technologies and projects, \ndesigning appropriate business models for their implementation and identifying enablers for \nmarket development using a Stage-Gate analysis approach.\nThe Roadmap also estimates costs for achieving the RE generation targets based on the \ninternational/ regional costs and experiences from implementing RE projects in Afghanistan. \nFurther, it proposes applicable sources of funds for development of RE sector. \nAn essential component of the Roadmap is the institutional arrangement for its \nimplementation and enhancing the capacities of various stakeholders through training on \nknowledge products particularly the project selection and decision-making tool and system \noptimization models.\n#Methodological framework and presentation of Roadmap\nThe framework and approach for RE Roadmap rests on four pillars- an assessment of RE \nresource potential and its deployment through various technologies and projects; \nappropriate markets and business models for using these technologies; enablers (both policy \nand market related) that are required to implement the appropriate business models; and \nestimation of system costs in Afghanistan for financing of the Roadmap.\n#Technologies and systems\n1. The available RE resources in Afghanistan and their technical potential include solar, \nwind, hydro (small, mini and micro), biomass (including waste-to-energy) and \ngeothermal. These resources can be harnessed through a variety of technologies and \nsystems addressing electrical and thermal energy needs. The systems are categorized \nas utility scale, mini-grids and off-grid/ stand- alone which also represent the RE \nmarket segments in Afghanistan. Some of these technologies and systems include MW \nscale solar PV (both flat plate and concentrating); roof-top and stand-alone PV \nsystems; concentrating solar thermal for power generation and for low grade process \nheat applications; wind farms and stand-alone wind-electric generators; small hydro \npower projects; mini-grids and biogas digesters.\n2. The process for developing project pipeline follows a 3\u2013level decision process:\na. Level 1 assesses the possibility of utility scale RE projects on the basis of good \nquality RE resource, availability of national grid for power evacuation, road \nconnectivity and overall security situation. If not satisfied, it points at options \nof mini-grids and off-grid stand-alone systems.\nb. Level 2 assesses the viability of setting up either RE/ hybrid mini-grids or \nstand-alone systems on the basis of population concentration, nature of loads\n(i.e. domestic, institutional, enterprises, anchor loads such as telecom \ntowers), and operational diesel mini-grids that can be hybridised or replaced \nwith RE. \nc. Level 3 assesses the feasibility of specific projects on the basis of primary \nenergy surveys, topographical studies, environmental and social impact \nassessment (if required), community engagement activities, stakeholder \nconsultations etc. 11\nThe decision process evolves into a flow-chart and is presented as the decision \ntool to develop RE project pipeline for Afghanistan.\n#Markets and business models\n3. Further, for each of the market segments (i.e. utility scale, mini-grids, off-grid/ \nstand-alone), the Roadmap recommends business models that identify the roles of \nthe government, DABS, private sector (already present and likely to be present), MFIs, \nNGOs and communities. Regional and international best practices have been studied \nand customized for designing the businesses models for Afghanistan. Solar Power \nParks, solar roof-top with net-metering, RESCO (Renewable Energy Service Company) \nand microfinance aided sale of stand-alone devices (i.e. Pay-As-You-Go) are some of \nthe business models selected for RE projects in Afghanistan.\n#Ecosystem enablers\n4. The Roadmap uses a Stage-Gate model to discuss the enablers that are required for \ndevelopment of RE markets across several technologies and business models. Market \ndevelopment is expected to commence with the introduction of policies and \nguidelines for specific technologies and business models, such as the feed-in tariffs, \nand net-metering policy. Implementation of model projects across technologies as \npublic \u2013 private \u2013 partnership (PPP) projects, will further develop this sector. This \ninitial stage is termed as Market Seeding.\n5. With favourable policies and an enabling business environment, commercial-scale \nprojects may be implemented, moving the market from seeding to Market Creation \nstage. The first few commercial projects, led by the private sector, will comprise \nlow-risk options where risks and gains are shared across the government, private \nsector and beneficiary communities. The subsequent stage is that of Market \nTransformation where technologies and markets are mainstreamed within the overall \nenergy sector. \n#Costing and financing\n6. The costs for applicable RE technologies and projects in Afghanistan have been \ncollected through primary research by directly consulting with project developers, \nmainly members of Afghanistan Renewable Energy Union (AREU) and a few NGOs and \ndonors. These costs are compared with regional and international costs to understand \nand then benchmark RE costs for Afghanistan. \n7. The above exercise helps in estimating the financing requirements for the Roadmap\nand suggesting enablers that can help in reducing the costs in future. An analysis of \nvarious available mechanisms- globally, regionally and locally- is undertaken to \nrecommend possible ways to finance the Roadmap.\n#Implementation arrangement\n8. It is important to recognize the hierarchy of this document (the Roadmap) within the \nrenewable energy development planning process. The RENP sets the vision and goals \nfor RE development in Afghanistan and the Roadmap develops a strategy for achieving \nthese goals. The next logical step is to implement the strategy laid out in the \nRoadmap by carrying out activities and initiatives and monitoring their progress with \nthe help of a tracking system. A brief discussion on the implementation arrangement\nwith focus on institutional structure, skill enhancements and training is also included \nin this document.\n#Presentation of Roadmap\nThe Roadmap is presented in eight chapters. It maps the RE resource potential across \ndifferent regions; selects appropriate and viable RE technologies; identifies applications and \ncategorises markets for selected RE technologies; develops project pipeline for identified \nmarkets and designs suitable business models for each market category. This analysis is based \non the Decision Tool, specifically developed for this purpose and applied across Afghanistan.\nSubsequently, the Roadmap focuses on enablers and actions required for achieving the \ntargets and milestones using the Stage-Gate model customised for market categories and \nbusiness models. The enablers are analysed across technical, financial, regulatory and \ninstitutional landscape, as applicable to Afghanistan. Further, the analysis also includes \nestimation of costs for various technologies in Afghanistan. The outcome of this analysis are \nthe financial requirements and financing modalities; regulatory & institutional framework \nfor setting up business models; assessment and planning for institutional capacities and \nevaluation of overall impacts of implementing the Roadmap. \n#1 INTRODUCTION\n#1.1 Rationale\nRenewable energy sector development is one of the priority areas for the Government of \nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan (GoIRA) for immediate purpose of providing access to \nmodern energy to remote and rural population and for medium to long term purpose of \nproviding energy security to the country. Afghanistan is rich in energy resources, both fossil \nfuel based and renewables. However, it still depends heavily on imported electricity and \nfuels and has one of the lowest per capita consumption of electricity in the world. Lack of \ndomestic generation remains the key challenge for energy security and energy access in \nAfghanistan. Its 30% electrification rate ranks it in the lowest 5% in per capita energy \nconsumption globally. Out of the total 519 MW installed capacity, 51% is thermal (diesel and \nfurnace oil) with a generation cost of $0.25-0.35 per kWh, which is four times that of \nimported electricity. The remaining 49% (254 MW) is from hydropower, which is seasonal \nand has a capacity factor of less than 40%. Over 80% of total electricity supply is imported1. \nThe Roadmap for renewable energy for Afghanistan identifies pathways for reaching about \n5,000 MW of renewable energy based generation capacity by 2032, in line with the \nAfghanistan Renewable Energy Policy targets and vision. It provides an inclusive, medium to \nlong-term vision of the renewable energy sector, taking into cognizance inter-dependencies \nbetween energy, environment and overall socio-economic development. It also provides a \n\u2018portfolio approach\u2019, integrating technologies and market structures that are based on \nviable business models and finance options. \n#1.2 Contextual analysis \nThe foundation of the RE development is based on the Afghanistan National Development \nStrategy (ANDS, 2008) which provides the overall vision and goals of the energy sector; \nPower Sector Master Plan, (PSMP, 2013) that provides the overall status and priorities of \npower sector network planning and expansion, including identification of regions where \nnetwork expansion in not economically viable; and the National Energy Supply Program, \n(NESP, 2013). The NESP has set the short-term (by 2015) and long-term (up to 2022) targets \nfor electricity supply, energy efficiency and renewable energy sector, energy institutions \nand private sector participation, as well as capacity and regulatory framework \ndevelopment. Recently approved Renewable Energy Policy (RENP, 2015), as an overarching \npolicy instrument, has set ambitious targets for RE development in the country. The \nAfghanistan Integrated Energy Policy is proposing to put the RE sector development as one \nof its strategic intents. \nThe above is broadly in sync with the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) target for energy \naccess for all by 2030, which is developed as a country level plan of action to ensure access \nto energy for all. Development of renewable energy is also one of the priority areas for low \nemission development for Afghanistan (NAMA, 2015) particularly in the context of energy \naccess to rural communities to think and act beyond lighting energy.\nThe Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan for Afghanistan (CCSAP, 2015) targets 100 \npercent electricity coverage by 2100 as mandated within the National Priority Programs. It \nfurther targets at least 40 percent share of renewable energy in the Afghanistan national \ngrid by 2100, with an increased presence of decentralised renewable energy based systems \nto cater to off-grid areas. Subsequently, the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions \n(INDC) have identified access to renewable energy for 25% of rural population as the goal.\nMany donors and international organisations are supporting the development of renewable \nenergy sector in Afghanistan. The Asian Development Bank, GIZ, DFID, Islamic Development \nBank are among a few. \nAccording to the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW), about 5100 RE Projects have been \njointly implemented/ under implementation by MEW/MRRD/DABS and other developers, the \ninstalled capacity of the mentioned projects is 55 MW. MEW has recently invited \nprivate sector to invest in 30 RE projects totalling upto 100 MW and comprising biogas, solar, \nwind, hydro and hybrid technology options. \nProjects Total\nTotal No of Renewable Energy Projects Completed 4,602;\nTotal No of Renewable Energy Projects Planned 99;\nTotal No of Renewable Energy Projects Under Construction 493;\nTotal Capacity of Renewable Energy Projects (no.) 5,911;\nTotal Capacity of Renewable Energy Projects Completed and (kW) 55,011;\nBiomass Total number 44 Capacity (kW) 0;\nMHP Total number 2,678 Capacity (kW) 52,913;\nSolar Total number 2,450 Capacity (kW) 1,868;\nWind Total number 22 Capacity (kW) 230;\nTotal Total number 5,194 Capacity (kW) 55,01116;\n#1.3 Business environment and industrial landscape\nThe renewable energy industry in Afghanistan is in infancy. The AREU is a newly formed \nbody with about 45 members and consist of equipment manufacturers and system \nintegrators. The status of financial sector remains a constraint for private sector \ndevelopment and limited access to credit is limiting the growth and involvement of local RE \nindustry in rural and renewable energy sector. The business environment is characterised \nby grant based delivery models. Private sector engagement in the RE market is still weak \nand unsystematic. \nThe tariff regime is largely dominated by Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), the \nnational utility. DABS operates on a cost-plus pricing basis. As a result, tariff rates can be \nhigh, and they often are. The weighted average tariff in 2014 was Afs 7.3 (0.11 $) per kWh. \nCommercial customers of DABS almost everywhere pay around 8-10 Afs (0.15 $) per kWh. \nFurther, DABS finances are affected by foreign exchange movements; since imported power \nis purchased in USD while local revenues are in AFN. Increasing the proportion of supply \nfrom domestic sources is one lever to manage this risk.\n#1.4 Renewable and rural energy programs and key outcomes\nThe renewable energy landscape in Afghanistan is dominated by hydropower and solar PV \ntechnologies. National Solidarity Program (NSP)/ NABDP and Energy for Rural Development \nin Afghanistan (ERDA) within NABDP, have been the flagship programs of MRRD for rural \nenergization.\nIn addition to MRRD, DABS also carries out grid extensions to rural areas under the NESP of \nMEW. Apart from the MRRD and MEW programmes, there are efforts by FAO, NZAID and GiZ\nat a smaller scale which are also supporting village electrification. There are also small\u0002scale efforts by NGOs such as COAM and Geres targeting thermal energy issues. However,\nthe thermal energy needs are not being addressed in any significant scale by existing \nprogrammes and there has not been much penetration of energy efficient devices. \nDependence on fuel wood and other non-renewable biomass is very high and indoor air \npollution and resultant lower respiratory illnesses is the biggest cause of pre-mature deaths \nin Afghanistan.\nAlong with hydropower, solar home systems have also proliferated across the country. The \nmain reasons behind solar PV\u2019s popularity are its affordability and portability, due to its \nhighly scalable and modular structure. However, as on date the renewable energy landscape \nis dominated by smaller systems, catering mostly to lighting and household level demand. \nSome experience has been generated recently on the use of solar PV pumps both for drinking \nwater and for irrigation by the MRRD\u2019s National Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Irrigation\nProgramme (Ru-WatSIP), and also on large scale (between 500 kWp to 1 MWp) of solar PV \nbased mini-grids.\nThe rural electrification efforts supported by the international community has led to key \nlearning including:\n\u2022 There is a need to go beyond household electrification for lighting by addressing \nhousehold thermal energy needs and engaging anchor customers for productive \nuse in the commercial sector and public service opportunities in rural \ngovernment institutions. Monthly expenditure on solid fuels during winter \nmonths is considered to be 10 times higher than the spend on kerosene for \nlighting.;\n\u2022 There is a need for integrated planning for energy projects along with \ninfrastructure projects that will get direct benefits from reliable energy and \nvice-versa. For instance, planning for agriculture based livelihoods projects (i.e. \ncold-storages) should include a component of energy provision and likewise \nplanning for energy projects (i.e. MHP) should identify and support enterprises \nand public institutions that will use the electricity thus generated.;\n\u2022 The mini-grid systems are infrastructure projects and hence require standard \napproaches of engineering services, project planning and operational \nmanagement. All the projects should be planned and implemented in a coherent \nmanner using standard guidelines and practices. In this regard, internationally \naccepted forms of contract, contract management and engineering supervision \nshould be used.;\n\u2022 New technologies and technology innovation must be tracked by the planning \nand engineering teams and integrated within the overall framework of electricity \nservice provision. Further, system planning and optimisation tools for maximising \nthe benefits of hybrid configurations for generation from renewable energy and \ndistributed generation topologies must be used.;\n\u2022 A common and accepted understanding of the roles and responsibilities in the \nownership, operation and management, maintenance, payment for services, \nregulation, funding and financing, etc. are critical and should be achieved.;\n\u2022 Financing model of almost all the cost of the installation and maintenance with \ndonor funding is not sustainable, collecting fee-for-services from the consumers \nis important for O&M of the plant.;\n\u2022 It will be important to create rural energy service delivery models that engage \nthe private sector and financial institutions and leverage donor and government \nsources to create scalable and replicable models.;\n\u2022 There is a need to include gender perspective in the planning and \nimplementation of rural energy projects and gender mainstreaming should be an \nintegral component of any policy and planning framework.;\n#1.5 Relevance of mapping the road to RE development \nMapping the road to RE development (The Roadmap), is important not only for meeting the \ninternal objectives of energy access and energy security, but also to keep Afghanistan \naligned with international initiatives on climate change adaptation and mitigation; \nsustainable development goals, and regional energy trade. At the macro level, the Roadmap \nshall contribute to achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs), especially towards \nreduction of poverty (SDG 1), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) and industry, innovation \nand infrastructure (SDG 9). It also addresses concerns in good health and wellbeing (SDG 3) \nand quality education (SDG 4) through provision of energy security for better service delivery \nin social sectors. Consistency with climate action (SDG 13) is maintained by linking the \nRoadmap\u2019s broad vision and outputs with key national climate policy documents such as the \nAfghanistan CCSAP and INDC.\nFollowing figure highlights the relevance of the Roadmap.\n#Prospects\n\u2022 Only 30% energy access in rural areas and \n65% in urban;\n\u2022 Estimates suggest 222 GW of solar, 66 GW \nof wind and 23GW of hydro potential;\n\u2022 Role of RE recognized for energy access, \nenergy security, SDGs and climate \nresilient development ;\n#Situation\n\u2022 Forward looking and conducive policy \nregime;\n\u2022 RED (MEW), a dedicated department to \ndevelop RE sector;\n\u2022 Donors support to further the sector;\n\u2022 Private sector taking interest;\n#Requirements\n\u2022 Efficient and effective regulatory and \npolicy landscape to attract private sector;\n\u2022 Regulatory and policy landscape to be \nefficient and effective for private sector \nto participate in RE development;\n\u2022 Strong pipeline for economically \nsustainable and financially viable projects ;\n\u2022 Local industry to be strengthened to \nsupport the implementation of RE \nprojects;\n\u2022 Synergistic approach by donors and other \ndevelopmental partners ;\n\u2022 Institutions absorptive to the capacity \nbuilding and strengthening initiatives;\n#Obstacles\n\u2022 Internal security, particularly for \ninternational companies and experts ;\n\u2022 Safety and connectivity related issues for \ntravels to remote areas;\n\u2022 Availability of trained personnel ;\n\u2022 Lack of funds and financing;\n#2 TECHNOLOGIES AND MARKETS\n#2.1 From vision to targets \nThe vision of this Roadmap is to guide policy makers, the private sector, developers and\nother key stakeholders in shaping the renewable energy sector in Afghanistan. As discussed, \nthe target for 2032 is to achieve around 5,000 MW of RE capacity to be realised as the RE \nmarket traverses three stages- Seeding, Creation and Transformation. The process for \nachieving these targets starts with an assessment of applicable and appropriate RE \ntechnologies for Afghanistan on the basis of a) RE resource potential, b) techno-commercial \nstatus at global level and c) appropriate system designs and configuration for various \napplications and markets.\n#2.2 Renewable energy outlook for Afghanistan\n#2.2.1 RE resource potential\nAfghanistan\u2019s renewable energy potential is estimated to be over 300,000 MW6, consisting \nof solar (222,849 MW), wind (66,726 MW), hydro (23,310 MW) and biomass (4,000 MW). \nGeothermal needs more detailed assessments to ascertain realizable potential.\nAppropriate technologies for harnessing the above RE resources are briefly discussed below.\n#2.2.2. Technologies and markets\nThe RE resource potential available in Afghanistan can be harnessed using various \ntechnologies, some of them are already available and used in Afghanistan, while some others \nare yet to be introduced. These RE technologies can be configured into different types of \nsystems suitable for specific applications and markets. \nThe RENP has identified three main categories of applications and markets that require the \nuse of RE technologies and systems. These are:\n\u2022 Utility scale (MW and above) essentially grid-connected to increase the domestic \nsupply into the energy generation mix of the country;\n\u2022 Mini-grids for serving the load centers and population clusters for enhancing the \nlivelihoods;\n\u2022 Stand-alone for servicing the basic and productive needs to off-grid communities;\n#2.3 Description of RE technologies and systems\n#2.3.1 Solar photovoltaics (PV) \nAfghanistan has a good solar resource that can be harnessed for electricity generation and \nfor thermal applications. The country enjoys particularly long sunny days with high \nirradiation, ranging from 4.5 - 7 kWh/m\u00b2/day. \nTechnologies that convert solar energy into electric energy and usable heat are classified\ninto two types: Solar Photovoltaic (PV) and Solar Thermal technologies respectively. Solar \nPV is one of the most advanced and universally applicable RE technologies that also boasts \nof a fastest growth curve in the recent years. Global installed capacity for Solar PV stands \nat 303 GWp, of which, the largest capacity exists in China, followed by Japan and Germany. \n#Basis description of solar PV technology\nSolar cells, the building block of PV system, convert sunlight directly into DC electricity. \nThese are categorized based on materials they are made of, such as wafer-based crystalline \nsilicon (c-Si) (either mono-crystalline or multi-crystalline silicon) and thin-films using \namorphous Si (a-Si/ c-Si), cadmium-telluride (CdTe) and copper-indium-gallium-selenide \n(CIGS). Figure 5 gives the current market share of PV technologies as per year 2015.\nSolar cells are assembled and electrically interconnected to form solar PV modules. In a c\u0002Si PV module, slices (wafers) of solar-grade (high purity) silicon are made into cells that are \nassembled into modules and electrically connected. Thin film PV modules consist of thin \nlayers of semiconductor material deposited onto inexpensive, large-size substrates such as \nglass, polymer or metal. Several solar PV modules are connected in series and/ or in parallel \nto increase voltage and/or current, respectively. An inverter is needed to convert direct \ncurrent (DC) into alternating current (AC) for grid integration and use with most electrical \nappliances. Solar PV Modules and balance of system (i.e. inverter, mounting structures, \npower control unit (PCU), cabling and batteries, if any) form a modular PV system with a \ncapacity ranging from picowatts to gigawatts.\n#System configurations\nSolar PV systems are used to generate electricity for both grid-connected and off -grid \napplications, such as residential and commercial buildings, industrial facilities, remote and \nrural areas and large power plants.\nBased on the system configurations, grid connectivity and system portability, solar PV \nsystems are generally categorized mainly into 4 types:\n\u2022 Utility scale ;\n\u2022 Roof-top (which can be both grid connected and stand-alone);\n\u2022 Mini-grids ;\n\u2022 Stand-alone ;\nThe choice of solar PV technology for installation is often based on a trade-off between \ninvestment cost, module efficiency and electricity tariff. Thin film solar PV technology is \ngenerally cheaper, though significantly less efficient and requires substantially more surface \narea for the same power output than c-Si-based systems. Conversion efficiencies of \ncommercially available PV modules are given in Table 4.\n#I. Utility scale PV systems\nUtility scale solar PV systems are typically in MW range and are generally ground-mounted. \nThese are deployed either as Independent Power Projects (IPPs) or in Solar Power Parks \n(SPPs). Electricity generated from these projects is evacuated through the national (or \nprivate, as the case may be) transmission network.\n#II. Roof-top solar PV systems\nRoof-top solar PV is a modular, grid-connected or standalone system that has electricity \ngenerating solar panels mounted on the roof of any building. By virtue of being mounted on \na roof, these systems are small compared to ground mounted solar PV stations that could \nbe in the MW range. Typically, solar PV roof-top systems range from 1 kW and upto 100 kW \nin terms of installed capacity.\n#III. Solar PV mini-grids \nSolar PV mini-grids have their own generation source (solar) and a local distribution grid. \nThese are an ideal alternative to grid electricity in areas (such as remote villages) that do \nnot have grid connectivity. Mini-grids also provide more reliable electricity, as any power \ncuts or interruptions to electricity supply can be quickly identified and corrected. \nAdditionally, having the site of power generation closer to the load also reduces transmission \nand distribution (T&D) losses associated with centralised generation.\nIn most cases, solar PV mini-grids are either hybridized with other RE sources (i.e. wind) or \nwith diesel and are backed up with batteries to increase the reliability and supply of \nelectricity, particularly in case where electricity is required for after sun-shine hours. \nTypical sizes of mini-grids are from 10 kW to 1 MW. Figure 7 shows a typical solar mini-grid \nsystem.\n#IV. Stand-alone solar PV systems\nStand-alone solar PV systems have many different applications across different sectors such \nas lighting, pumping and battery charging. The most popular stand-alone solar PV systems \nare:\n1. Solar lanterns\n2. Solar home systems (SHS)\n3. Solar streetlights\n4. Solar battery charging systems\n5. Solar power packs (defence, telecommunication, etc.)\n6. Solar pumps\nIn addition to the above proven system configurations, there are some new and emerging \nconcepts which are worth mentioning here. These are the floating PV installations on static \nwater bodies (such as lakes and reservoirs), canal-top PV systems, and concentrating PV.\n#V. Floating solar systems\nFloating PV systems are installed over the surface of stationary water bodies such as \nreservoirs, lakes and ponds to generate electricity. It allows efficient use of the water body \nby reducing evaporation of water and improved \nyield from solar PV panels due to lowered \nambient temperatures. These installations are \nparticularly useful when availability of land is a \nconstraint. However, there are some challenges \nwhich need to be overcome before this concept \ncan become a techno-commercial viable \napplication. These are related to design and \nmaterials of float, including the anchoring,\nimpact on aquatic flora and fauna and social \nimpacts on fishermen, local communities etc.\n#VI. Canal-top PV systems\nCanal-top PV systems are installed across the \ncanals and water channels. It allows efficient use \nof the canals by reducing evaporation of water. \nThe capacity of canal-top PV systems may vary \nfrom small-scale (kW-sized) to larger-scale (MW\u0002sized) installations. Although similar in capacity to \nground mounted systems, this system varies \nsignificantly because of the need of a longer, \nwider and stronger mounting structure to support \nits installation over the width of the canal.\n#VII. Concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) systems\nCPV uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi\u0002junction (MJ) solar cells. In addition, CPV systems often use solar trackers and sometimes a \ncooling system to further increase their efficiency. Ongoing research and development \n(R&D) is rapidly improving their competitiveness in the utility-scale segment and in areas of \nhigh insolation.\n#Global status and outlook\nGlobal Solar PV installations at the end of 2016 stand at 303 GWp, contributed both by \nindustrialized and developing countries. The size and number of large-scale power plants \ncontinue to grow globally. During early 2016, at least 120 (70 in the previous year) solar PV \nplants of sizes 50 MW and larger were operating in 23 countries. Increase in market for solar \nPV is due to its increasing competitiveness, new government programmes, rising demand for\nelectricity and increased awareness of solar PV\u2019s potential as countries seek to reduce \npollution and CO2 emissions. \nUntil 2014, developed countries (namely Germany, Italy and Japan) dominated investment \nin solar. In 2015, developing countries such as China, India, Chile, South Africa and a few \nothers increased the level of deployment of both utility and small-scale investment in solar \nPV. Solar power (both solar PV and thermal) investment in 2016 in developed countries was \nUSD 56.2 billion, compared to USD 57.5 billion in developing and emerging economies.\n#Status and relevance in Afghanistan\nAs per IRENA, a cumulative capacity of 1MW has been installed in Afghanistan by 2016. The \nlargest one is 1MW solar PV off grid system, which is installed in Bamyan province, supported \nby New Zealand Government. Some other important installations are: a 250KW solar PV off\u0002gird system installed near the Kabul airport by the Japan Embassy, a 100kW solar PV off\u0002grid system installed in Gardiz province, many roof-top solar PV systems through NSP in \nremote areas & villages and a number of standalone systems. Majority of these are installed \nthrough donor driven programmes. \nSolar PV systems have a significant role to play in overall development of electricity sector \nin Afghanistan on account of the following:\n\u2022 Majority of the population in remote areas doesn\u2019t have access to electricity and off\u0002grid solar PV systems are a viable option where population is dispersed and scattered \nover a wide area;\n\u2022 Demand for electricity for irrigation is currently met through DG systems, which can \nbe replaced by solar water pumping systems ;\n\u2022 Utility scale solar PV projects can contribute to generation at the national level; \n\u2022 Solar PV systems are useful and applicable for nomads (Kuchi people);\n#2.3.2 Solar thermal\nSolar thermal systems convert solar radiation into heat. These systems are used to raise the \ntemperature of a heat transfer fluid which can be air, water or a specially designed fluid. \nThe heated fluid can then be used directly for hot water needs or space heating/cooling \nneeds, or a heat exchanger can be used to transfer the thermal energy to the final \napplication. The heat generated can also be stored in a storage tank for use in the hours \nwhen the sun is not available.\nSolar thermal systems find various applications such as electricity generation, water \nheating, space heating/ cooling, industrial process heating, electricity generation etc. Solar \nthermal technologies can be divided into two broad categories: non-concentrating and \nconcentrating.\n#Non-concentrating solar thermal technologies\nSolar thermal technologies in which sunlight is directly absorbed and is not concentrated, \nare called non-concentrating solar thermal technologies. They work on the principle of \nexposing a dark surface to solar radiation so that the radiation is absorbed. Non\u0002concentrating collectors absorb both direct and diffuse radiation. The absorbed radiation is \nthen transferred to a fluid, like air or water. There are two main types of non-concentrating \nsolar thermal collectors: flat-plate collectors and evacuated tube collectors.\n#I. Flat-plate collectors (FPC)\nFPC system consists of tubes carrying a fluid running through an insulated, weather-proof \nbox with a dark absorber material and thermal insulation material on the backside that also \nprevents heat loss. FPC systems are typically used for heating swimming pools and other \nlow-temperature applications.\n#II. Evacuated tube collectors(ETC)\nETC system use parallel rows of glass tubes, each of which contains either a heat pipe or \nanother type of absorber, surrounded by a vacuum. This greatly reduces heat loss, \nparticularly in cold climates. ETC systems are typically used in solar water heating systems \n(SWHs). \n#Concentrating solar thermal technologies\nConcentrating solar thermal technologies use mirrors to concentrate sunlight and produce \nheat and steam to generate electricity via a conventional thermodynamic cycle. Unlike solar \nPV, concentrating solar thermal uses only the Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) and provides \nheat and power only in regions with high DNI. Concentrating solar thermal systems can be \nequipped with a heat storage system to use heat energy even under cloudy skies or after \nsunset. Concentrating solar thermal systems used to generate electricity as an outcome are \nknown as Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems and those used to generate heat as an \noutcome are known as Concentrating Solar Heat (CSH) systems.\nThere are four main concentrating solar thermal system configurations, that are \ncommercially available:\n#I. Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR) system\nLinear Fresnel Reflector (LFR) systems use a series of ground-based, flat or slightly curved \nmirrors placed at different angles to concentrate the sunlight onto a fixed receiver located \nseveral meters above the mirror field.\n#II. Parabolic trough collector (PTC) \nParabolic trough systems consist of parabolic mirrors that concentrate the sun\u2019s rays on heat \nreceivers (i.e. steel tubes) placed on the focal line. Receivers have a special coating to \nmaximize energy absorption and minimize infrared re-irradiation and work in an evacuated \nglass envelope to avoid convection heat losses.\nThe solar heat is removed by a heat transfer fluid (e.g. synthetic oil, molten salt) flowing \nin the receiver tube and transferred to a steam generator to produce the super-heated \nsteam that runs the turbine. Mirrors and receivers (i.e. the solar collectors) track the sun\u2019s \npath along a single axis (usually East to West). Parabolic troughs are desirable for certain \nindustrial and commercial needs to provide large amounts of hot water and/or for producing \nelectricity by running steam turbines. \n#III. Parabolic dish system\nParabolic dish systems consist of a parabolic dish shaped concentrator (like a satellite dish) \nthat reflects sunlight into a receiver placed at the focal point of the dish. The receiver may \nbe a Stirling engine (i.e. kinematic and free-piston variants) or a micro-turbine. Parabolic \ndish systems require two-axis sun tracking systems and offer very high concentration factors \nand operating temperatures. The main advantages of parabolic dish systems include high \nefficiency (i.e. up to 30%) and modularity, which is suitable for distributed generation. \n#IV. Central receiver tower system\nA central receiver tower system consists of a large number of mirrors (heliostats) that track \nthe sun individually over two axes and focuses on the central tower where the solar heat \ndrives a thermodynamic cycle and generates electricity. The heat transfer medium used for \nmost modern type solar towers includes water/steam, molten salts, liquid sodium, oil and \neven air. The sunlight from many mirror-like dish reflectors spread over a large area is \nfocused to one central point achieving an extremely high temperature which is used to \nproduce high pressure steam which is then used to generate electricity.\nIn addition to renewable heat and power generation, concentrating solar technologies have \nother economically viable and sustainable applications, such as co-generation for domestic \nand industrial heat use, water desalination and enhanced oil recovery in mature and heavy \noil fields.\n#Global status and outlook\nSolar thermal market is less established as compared to solar PV though its applications are \nvast and varied, particularly in developing countries\u2019 context. Total concentrating solar \npower installed capacity has reached 4.8 GW at the end of 2016 with a further 11 GW in \npipeline. Globally, costs for solar thermal technologies are declining, several new \ntechnologies are under development, and thermal energy storage (TES) is becoming \nincreasingly important and remains the focus of extensive research and development. CSP \nis gathering increased policy support in nations with limited oil/gas reserves, constrained \npower networks or strong agenda for industrialization and job creation.\n#Status and relevance in Afghanistan\nThe largest solar thermal system (20m3/day) has been installed in Kabul University\u2019s \nwomen\u2019s dormitory funded by the World Bank. Some other small solar thermal systems \n(domestic and large scale) are installed in the schools, dormitories, children garden and \nmilitary bases since 1980.\nDifferent types of solar thermal systems are manufactured in the country, like solar \nconcentrated system for cooking, flat plate hot water system among others. Currently, \nadvance solar hot water system (SHWS) are imported from China and India and are being \nused in the houses and for commercial purposes. Small and large scale of solar driers are \nmade and used in agriculture sector. \nThere is a huge potential of solar thermal systems such as SHWS, which can be utilized in \ndomestic sector, schools and mosques. Solar dryers can increase the quality of the local \nproducts in the agriculture sector. Local fabrication of the components can help create jobs \nand utilize locally manufactured materials. Solar cookers can be useful and applicable for \nrural communities and nomads.\n#Solar Thermal-LPG Hybrid Smart Cooking\nSolar Thermal- LPG Hybrid Smart Cooking system \nhas been commissioned at NTPC- Dadri, India \nwhich has been hybridized with Concentrating \nSolar Thermal M90 Dishes and efficient LPG Fired \nBurner. During day time (sunny hours) the system \nuses concentrating solar heat from M90 dishes for \ncooking, and during non-sunny periods, the LPG \nFired burner automatically fires up, to provide \ncompletely automated-uninterrupted heat to the \nkitchen for cooking. Solar Thermal M90 Dishes at \nNTPC bear low running cost, the payback period is \nless than four years.\nConfiguration of Concentrating Solar M90 Dishes at \nNTPC- Dadri, India:\nPeak Capacity at STC 80,000 kcal/hr.;\nApplication Cooking (Baking, Boiling and Frying);\nSystem Configuration Hot Thermic Oil at 220\u00b0C;\nIntegration Hybridized with LPG Thermic Oil Heater;\nPeak Capacity at STC 80,000 kcal/hr.;\nTotal Concentrator Area 2 Nos. of M90 Dishes totaling 180 m2;\n#Solar\u2013Biomass Hybrid Cold Storage-cum-Power Generation system for Rural Applications\nA new concept whereby available biomass and \nsolar resource could be used to operate a small, \ndecentralized cold storage right at the village \nlevel is implemented in National Institute of Solar \nEnergy (NISE), India and is now operational. In \naddition to providing the cold storage facility to \nthe farmers, such a system could also supply grid\u0002quality power to the village; thereby offering a \nholistic solution to some of the key problems \nfacing agrarian population. \nThe system, comprises a 15 kW (~5 TR) vapor \nabsorption machine (VAM) coupled with a 50 kWe \nbiomass gasifier system and a field of solar \nconcentrating collectors. The biomass gasifier produces synthesis gas using locally \navailable woody biomass, which is then used to run an engine-generator to produce \nelectricity. The waste heat from the biomass gasifier along with the heat energy from the \nsolar concentrating collectors is utilized by the VAM to cool the cold storage chamber. \nSince, the cold storage can be cooled to temperature as low as 0oC, a wide variety of \nfruit, vegetables, and horticulture produce can be stored there. The electricity generated \nby the system is enough to power domestic, community, as well as productive loads in a \ntypical village.\n#2.3.3 Hydro\n#Technology\nHydropower is a mature technology that is currently used to produce cost-effective, \nrenewable electricity. In hydropower technology, water\u2019s potential energy is converted to \nkinetic energy and spins the blade of a turbine, which activates a generator to produce \nelectricity. \nHydropower plants have two basic configurations: dams with reservoirs and run-of-river \nplants, with no reservoirs. The dam scheme can be sub-divided into small dams with night\u0002and-day regulation, large dams with seasonal storage and pumped storage reversible plants \n(for pumping and generation) for energy storage and night-and-day regulation. \nPumped storage plants consist of two or more natural or artificial (dams) reservoirs at \ndifferent elevations. When electricity generation exceeds grid demand, the energy is stored \nby pumping water from the lower to the higher reservoir. During peak electricity demand \nperiods, water flows back to the lower reservoir through the turbine, thus generating \nelectricity. In these kinds of plants, reversible Francis devices are used both for pumping \nwater and for generating electricity.\nSmall-scale hydropower is normally designed to run in-river. This is an environmentally \nfriendlier option because it does not significantly interfere with the river\u2019s natural flow. \nSmall-scale hydro is often used for distributed generation applications to provide electricity \nto rural populations.\nIn Afghanistan, hydropower plants are classified as pico-hydro (0 to 5 kW), micro-hydro (5 \nto 100 kW), mini-hydro (101kW to 1000 kW), small-hydro (1001Kw to 10,000 kW) and large\u0002hydro (above 10,001 kW).\nHydropower also provides other key services, such as flood control, irrigation and potable \nwater reservoirs. Hydropower is an extremely flexible electricity generation technology. \nHydro reservoirs provide built-in energy storage that enables a quick response to electricity \ndemand fluctuations across the grid, optimization of electricity production and \ncompensation for power losses from other sources.\n#Global status and outlook\nGlobally, a total capacity of 1,096 GW hydropower has been installed by the end of 2016. \nCountries such as China, Brazil, USA, Canada, Norway, India, and Russian federation \naccounted for 62% of installed capacities at the end of 2016. Other than increasing new \ncapacities, there is always a demand for refurbishment of existing plants to improve the \nefficiency of output, as well as environmental performance in the face of new regulatory \nrequirements. Innovations in hydropower technology include variable speed technology for \nnew and refurbished pumped storage plants, which assist in further integration of variable \nrenewable resources. \n#Status and relevance for Afghanistan\nIn Afghanistan, micro hydropower plants (MHPs) are commissioned and working in different \nprovinces. In 2014, 7 MHP systems ranging from (200 kW to 500 kW) were commissioned in \nBadakhshan province. These MHPs were later handed over to DABS and are currently run by \nDABS. Afghanistan, has many feasible sites for MHP plants. Local expertise is available for \noperation and maintenance of these systems in Afghanistan. MHP systems can play a crucial \nrole in economic and social development in the remote areas in Afghanistan.\nAs per ICE Energy Sector Report (Q2 2016), 42 MW Salma Hydro Power Plant (HPP) is in the \nfinal stage of completion by Indian government support and a 7.2 MW hydropower plant at \nFaizabad in KfW funding is under construction. Kajaki I HPP is expanding to a capacity of \n18.5 MW with funding support from USAID and construction contract for Kajaki II HPP with \n100 MW capacity has been signed with a private company. Construction of Surobi II HPP at \nKabul with capacity of 180 MW and Baghdara HPP with capacity of 240 MW is under progress \nwith support from private sector.\n#Micro Hydro Kinetic Turbine\nTata Power in India has successfully commissioned \nand tested a 10-kW low-head micro-hydro turbine, \ninstalled in the tailrace of the 150 MW Bhira hydro \npower plant in Maharashtra. The micro turbine \ngenerator was indigenously manufactured in Mumbai \nby Casmir Group based on the patented technology \nlicensed from the University of Southampton.\nThe turbine utilizes the existing flow rate available \nto generate clean energy. The AC power generated \nby the turbine generator is a function of the following \nthree factors combined:\n\u2022 Average water velocity in the range of 1.25 m/s to \n4 m/s (Increased power generation in faster flow);\n\u2022 Minimum machine diameter of 2.1m requires 2.5m of water depth (Increased power generation \nin sites with deeper waters using the longer blade variants available);\n\u2022 Continuous flows: total power generated depends on number of hours of water flow available \nat a site;\nOther than applications in tailraces of existing hydropower plants, rivers and canals, the micro \nhydro turbine has a bi-directionality option to facilitate operations in tidal currents as well.\nSource: http://www.tata.com/article/inside/Tata-Power-integrates-a-micro-hydro-turbine-at-its-Bhira\u0002hydro-power-station-in-Maharashtra\n#2.3.4 Wind\n#Technology\nThe kinetic energy of the moving air (or wind) is transformed into electrical energy by wind \nturbines or wind energy conversion systems. The wind forces the turbine\u2019s rotor to spin, \nchanging the kinetic energy to rotational energy by moving a shaft which is connected to a \ngenerator, thereby producing electrical energy through electromagnetism.\nWind power systems are categorized primarily by the grid connection (connected/ stand\u0002alone) and wind turbine type (vertical/horizontal-axis). The specific system configuration is \ndetermined mainly by the wind condition (especially wind speed), land availability (or where \nthe plant is sited), grid availability, turbine size and height, and blade size. Most large wind \nturbines are up-wind horizontal-axis turbines with three blades. Most small wind turbines \nare also horizontal-axis.\nHorizontal-axis turbines are being used commercially all over the world. The rotating shaft \nis mounted parallel to the wind flow/ground, and the turbines can have two types of rotors: \nup-wind and down-wind. The advantage of up-wind turbines is that they are minimally \ninfluenced by the turbulence caused by the tower. However, a yaw mechanism is needed to \nalign the turbine with the prevailing wind. \nA group of wind turbines in the same location used for production of electricity constitutes \na wind farm. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines \ndistributed over an extended area, but the land between the turbines may be used for \nagricultural or other purposes.\nWind energy is very consistent from year to year but has significant variation over shorter \ntime scales. It is therefore connected to the national electricity grid or can even be used as \na hybrid option with other electricity generating/ storage sources to give a reliable \nelectricity supply such as wind-solar hybrid, wind-diesel hybrid etc. Such hybrid options can \nbe used as mini-grids for supplying electricity to areas with no electricity grid.\nWind energy projects are common for off-grid applications such as water pumping and \nelectricity supply through wind power systems, wind-solar/ wind-diesel hybrid systems. \n#Global status and outlook\nGlobally, 487 GW of wind power technology has been installed by the end of 2015 of which, \nthe largest capacity exists in China, followed by United States, Germany and India. The wind \npower capacity at the end of 2016 was enough to meet almost 4% of total world electricity \nproduction. Wind power is now considered as the most cost-effective option in a large \nnumber of countries for new power generating capacity.\n#Status and relevance for Afghanistan\nAfghanistan has a good wind resource potential especially in South East part of the country. \nSixteen wind monitoring stations have been installed in different parts of the country. A few \nsmall wind turbine systems (<50kW) are installed in different locations of the country. The \nfirst ever wind turbine system of capacity 100 kW with battery backup system has been \ninstalled in Panjsher province. A couple of local wind turbine manufacturers are available \nin Kabul city who can fabricate up to 20kW wind turbines with accessories.\nWind power systems can be used in various configurations such as the following: \n\u2022 Wind farms can contribute significantly to national grid electricity \n\u2022 Wind mechanical pumps, which can be very useful for irrigation purposes especially \nin Farah, Nimroz and Herat provinces, because of high wind speeds\n\u2022 Small mechanical wind turbine can be hybridized with DG sets for remote areas, \ninstitutional and agricultural loads \nTechnology and systems\nBio-energy is generated from organic matter derived from plants or animals available on \nrenewable basis also known as \u201cBiomass\u201d. It is used for energy applications covering a \nvariety of practices and technologies, ranging from traditional heat production for cooking \nand/ or space heating to modern combined heat and power generation or biofuels \nproduction. Majority of the biomass energy is consumed in developing countries for \ntraditional uses with very low efficiency (10%-20%) such as cooking, while modern uses of \nbiomass for heat and power generation include mainly high-efficiency, direct biomass \ncombustion, co-firing with coal and biomass gasification.\nDirect, traditional uses of biomass for heating and cooking applications rely on a wide range \nof feedstock and simple devices, but the energy efficiency of these applications is very low \nbecause of biomass moisture content, low energy density and the type of the basic input. \nPre-treatment is done in order to improve biomass characteristics and make handling, \ntransport, and conversion processes more efficient and cost-effective such as:\n\u2022 Drying to reduce moisture content and transport costs of biomass feedstock and \nimprove combustion efficiency; \n\u2022 Palletisation and Briquetting to mechanically compact bulky biomass, such as \nsawdust or agricultural residues; \n\u2022 Torrefaction (for woody biomass) in which biomass is heated in the absence of oxygen \nto between 200-300\u00b0C and turned into char, with a process that is similar to \ntraditional charcoal production.;\n\u2022 Pyrolysis is a further thermo-chemical pre-treatment process during which biomass \nis heated to temperatures of 400-600\u00b0C in the absence of oxygen to produce pyrolysis \noil (also referred to as bio-oil), along with solid charcoal and a by-product gas.;\nBiomass is distributed worldwide and is extensively used for energy, however, securing good \nquality feedstock at affordable prices over a plant\u2019s lifetime is crucial for biomass power \nprojects. \nBio-energy is also being used in other forms and applications such as:\n#I. Improved cook-stoves \nImproved cook-stoves is basically a combustion device which burns biomass fuel more \nefficiently with reduced emissions and offers cleaner cooking energy solutions. These are \nbasically of two types; fixed type and portable type. The portable cook-stoves are also of \ntwo types; natural draft and forced draft. Forced draft cook-stoves are more efficient cook\u0002stoves compared to natural draft ones. Each type of cook-stove can be used for domestic as \nwell as community cooking applications. The improved cook-stoves may be made with \nmetal, ceramic and terracotta/ pottery (durable type) and combination thereof. \n#II. Biogas systems\nBiogas refers to a mixture of different gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter \nin the absence of oxygen. Biogas can be produced from raw materials such as agricultural \nwaste, manure, municipal waste, industrial waste, plant material, sewage, green waste or \nfood waste. Biogas systems provide:\n\u2022 Clean gaseous fuel for cooking and lighting;\n\u2022 Digested slurry from biogas plants to be used as enriched bio-manure to supplement \nchemical fertilizers;\n\u2022 Improved sanitation in villages and semi -urban areas by linking sanitary toilets with \nbiogas plants;\n#III. Waste to energy systems\nWaste to Energy systems allow treatment and processing of waste from urban & rural areas \nand industries, resulting in energy generation. Energy is generated from the organic fraction \nof waste (biodegradable as well as non-biodegradable) through thermal, thermo-chemical, \nbiochemical and electrochemical methods.\n\u2022 Thermal conversion: The process involves thermal degradation of waste under high \ntemperature. In this complete oxidation of the waste occurs under high temperature. \nThe major technological option under this category is Incineration.;\n\u2022 Thermo-chemical conversion: This process entails high temperature driven \ndecomposition of organic matter to produce either heat energy or fuel oil or gas. They \nare useful for wastes containing high percentage of organic non-biodegradable matter \nand low moisture content. The main technological options under this category include \nPyrolysis and Gasification. The products of these processes (producer gas, exhaust gases \netc.) can be used purely as heat energy or further processed chemically, to produce a \nrange of end products. ;\n\u2022 Bio-chemical conversion: This process is based on enzymatic decomposition of organic \nmatter by microbial action to produce methane gas, and alcohol etc. This process, on \nthe other hand, is preferred for wastes having high percentage of organic, bio\u0002degradable (putrescible) matter and high level of moisture/ water content, which aids \nmicrobial activity. The major technological options under this category are anaerobic \ndigestion (bio-methanation) and fermentation. Of the two, anaerobic digestion is the \nmost frequently used method for waste to energy, and fermentation is emerging. ;\n\u2022 Electrochemical conversion: Electrochemical conversion in the context of waste to \nenergy refers typically to microbial fuel cells (MFC). These systems are developed to \ntrap the energy from wastes, where the reduction-oxidation machinery of immobilized \nmicrobial cells is catalytically exploited, for the accelerated transfer of electrons from \norganic wastes, to generate electricity and bio-hydrogen gas. However, this \nmethodology needs extensive evaluation studies on bulk scale liquid waste treatments \nand stands at a nascent level, worldwide.;\n#Global status and outlook\nGlobally bio-power capacity reached 112 GW by the end of 2016. The share of bio-energy in \ntotal global primary energy consumption has remained steady since 2005, at around 10.5%.\nBy country, the United States is the largest producer of electricity from biomass sources and \nby region, European Union leads both the bio-power generation and capacity.\n#Status and relevance in Afghanistan\nMost of the rural population in Afghanistan is active in agriculture and livestock sector, \nhowever bio-energy technologies are still in a nascent stage. Only a limited number of family \ntype biogas plants have been installed in eastern provinces and central parts of the country \nthrough MRRD, BORDA Afghanistan and a couple of NGOs. Recently, some studies are under \nprocess for biomass energy projects in Kabul city and Balkh province under supervision of \nKabul Municipality, Ministry of Urban development. Applications of bio-energy such as waste \nto energy and biogas units are relevant to Afghanistan. Raw material (municipality waste) \nis available in the cities which can be utilized in the waste to energy projects for electricity \ngeneration. In remote areas, agricultural wastes are available that can act as a raw material \nfor biogas plants. Improved cook-stoves can also help to improve indoor air quality and offers \ncleaner cooking energy solutions. These can improve health protection of women and \nsociety in villages and keep the environment clean. \n#2.3.6 Geothermal\n#Technology\nGeothermal electricity generation is a mature, baseload generation technology that utilizes \nsteam or hot water from geothermally active areas to provide very competitive electricity \nwhere high-quality resources exist. Geothermal energy originates from the geological \nprocesses during formation of the planet, radioactive decay of minerals, and from solar \nenergy absorbed at the surface. Geothermal energy is available around the clock, \nindependent of the surface climatic conditions. Geothermal resources include dry steam, \nhot water, hot dry rock, magma, and ambient ground heat. \n#Global status and outlook\nGlobally, 13.5 GW of geothermal power has been installed at the end of 2016. Top five \nleading countries in the geothermal power generation are USA, Philippines, Indonesia, \nMexico and New Zealand. Geothermal direct use capacity has increased by a yearly average \nrate of 6% in recent years, while direct heat consumption has grown by 3.5%. The \ngeothermal industry continues to face significant project development risk; various efforts \nare under way to ameliorate such risks.\n#Status and relevance in Afghanistan\nGeothermal energy is a highly valuable, clean and reliable heat and power source in \nAfghanistan, which is still untapped. Historically, geothermal energy in Afghanistan has been \nonly used for medical bathing. Further geological, geochemical, and geophysical studies \nare required to characterize the reservoirs of numerous geothermal prospects in Afghanistan \nfor electricity generation and other applications.\n#2.3.7 Other related technologies\nIn addition to the above RE technologies, there are other related technologies which are \nsignificant for RE development in Afghanistan.\n#Air source heat pump\nAn air source heat pump (ASHP) is a system which uses energy to draw heat from outside to \ninside a building, or vice versa. This heat can then be used to heat radiators, underfloor \nheating systems and hot water circuit. Air source heat pump can absorb heat from the air \neven when the temperature is as low as -15\u00b0 C.\nThe energy that is produced by the air source heat pump is considered as a renewable \nbecause the air is heated by sun which then heats the house, even though the pump itself \nis powered by electricity. Air source heat pumps are an attractive alternative to \nconventional domestic heating systems such as LPG boilers. The air source heat pump is \npromising solution for building segments with limited roof area availability.\nA heat pump system consists of a compressor and two coils made of copper tubing. In heating \nmode, the refrigerant in the outside coils extracts heat from the air and evaporates into \nvapor form. The indoor coils release heat from the refrigerant while it condenses into a \nliquid. A reversing valve changes the direction of the refrigerant flow for cooling in summer.\nThere are two main types of air source heat pump systems: Air to Water and Air to Air. Air\u0002to-Air systems typically use fans to circulate warm air around the home and cannot be used \nto heat water. The performance of air source heat pumps is measured by the coefficient of \nperformance (COP). A COP of 3 means the heat pump generates 3 units of heat energy for \nevery 1 unit of electricity it consumes. Globally the market for heat pumps is assessed at \n58.3 million units (2013) and predicted to increase at a CAGR of 10.6% for 2014-2020. Air \nsource heat pumps have become widely available commercially only in the past few years.\nThe efficiency of heat pumps is expected to \nimprove by 2030 by 30-50% for heating and \n20-40% for cooling. Cost reductions are also \nexpected due to technology improvements,\nmarket penetration and synergy with \nthermal storage systems.\nThe figure illustrates the working of an Air \nSource Heat Pump.\n#Energy storage\nRenewable energy sources are intermittent in nature, producing energy when the sun is \nshining and the wind is blowing, and therefore energy storage becomes important for \nsupplying uninterrupted energy. Energy storage technologies absorb energy when production \nis more than the demand and store it for a period before releasing it to supply energy. By \nstoring the energy produced and delivering it on demand, it can level out peaks in output \nto create a continuous, reliable stream of power throughout the day.\nEnergy storage technologies are divided into following six main categories. \n\u2022 Electric batteries store electricity in the form of chemical energy and are mainly of two \ntypes \u2013 rechargeable and non-rechargeable;\n\u2022 Flywheels are mechanical devices that stores electricity as rotational energy which is \nharnessed to deliver instantaneous electricity;\n\u2022 Compressed air energy storage stores off-peak electricity to compress air which is later \ndischarged to the gas turbine to generate electricity during peak periods;\n\u2022 Thermal storage systems store thermal energy by heating or cooling a storage medium \nwhich can be used at a later stage for heating and cooling applications and power \ngeneration;\n\u2022 Pumped hydropower storage facilities store energy in the form of water in an upper \nreservoir, pumped from another reservoir at a lower elevation. During periods of high \nelectricity demand, power is generated by releasing the stored water through turbines \nin the same manner as a conventional hydropower station.;\nToday, energy (electricity and thermal) storage technologies exist at different levels of \ndevelopment, from the R&D to demonstration and commercialization. Figure 19 shows the \ndevelopment stages of various energy storage technologies. The energy storage market is \nestimated to grow to an annual installation size of 6 GW in 2017 and over 40 GW by 2022 \nfrom 0.34 GW installed in 2012 and 2013.\n#2.4 Recommended RE technologies and systems\nThis chapter has discussed and provided a long list of technologies that are to be harnessed \nin Afghanistan.The following table gives a summary of all RETs that are being studied as \npossibilities for implementation, along with their applications.\n#Key highlights of Renewable energy sector\n\u2022 By the end of 2016, the renewable energy installed capacity was enough to supply an \nestimated 24.5% of global electricity, with hydropower providing about 16.6%. The world now \nadds more renewable power capacity annually than it adds (net) capacity from all fossil fuels \ncombined. [Renewables 2017 Global Status Report, REN21];\n\u2022 The record lab solar PV cell efficiency has reached 25.6 % for mono-crystalline and 20.8 % for \nmulti-crystalline silicon wafer-based technology. [Photovoltaics Report 2016, Fraunhofer ISE]\n\u2022 Even in conservative scenarios and assuming no major technological breakthroughs, solar \npower will be the cheapest form of electricity in many regions of the world. Depending on \nannual sunshine, power cost of 4\u20136 cents/kWh are expected by 2025, reaching 2\u20134 cents/kWh \nby 2050;\n\u2022 By end of 2015, global concentrating PV (CPV) capacity reached 360 MW, most of which are \nhigh-concentration systems (CR: 300-1000) [Renewables 2016 Global Status Report, REN21]. \nWith concentrator technology, module efficiencies of up to 38.9 % (lab record) & 33 % \n(commercially) have been reached. [Photovoltaics Report 2016, Fraunhofer ISE];\n\u2022 Since first floating plant installation in 2007, the total installed capacity globally has now \nreached 93 MWp with 70 floating PV plant worldwide. The biggest floating plant has a capacity \nof 20 MWp.;\n\u2022 A new form of CSP, called STEM (Solar Thermo Electric Magaldi), which uses fluidized silica \nsand as a thermal storage and heat transfer medium to produce 24-hour industrial scale power \nfor off-grid applications is receiving international interest. By using fluidized solids as \nalternative to other storage media, the use of corrosive or environmentally unfriendly fluids \ncan be cut down and the receiver can be operated at much higher temperature. On 30th June \n2016, the first STEM industrial model plant started operations in San Filippo del Mela (Sicily).;\n\u2022 Repowering, i.e. replacing old wind turbines with modern higher capacity turbines, is on the \nrise. It has led to increase in wind power while reducing the footprint. A 2 MW wind turbine \nwith an 80-m diameter rotor now generates four to six times more electricity than a 500 kW, \n40 m diameter rotor built in 1995. [IEA Website];\n\u2022 Bioenergy accounts for around 7% of all industrial heat consumption, and has not increased in \nrecent years. [Renewables 2017 Global Status Report, REN21];\n\u2022 Asia has the highest number of small-scale biogas digesters, with more than 100 million people \nin rural China and 4.83 million people in India have access to digesters to produce gas for \ncooking and space heating. [Renewables 2016 Global Status Report, REN21];\n\u2022 Two lithium ion battery storage projects totalling 37.5 MW & 150 MWh is under construction \nphase in Southern California. When completed, the larger, 120 MWh (30 MW for 4 hours) \nproject will be the single biggest lithium ion battery in service on a utility grid in the world. \nIn March 2016, a project with 50 MW, 300 MWh sodium-sulfur battery facility went into \nservice.;\n\u2022 In October 2016, the Powerwall 2 (an upgrade to its previous version), a home battery unit, \nwas unveiled by Tesla Company. It is considered a game changer for the residential energy \nstorage market. The improved version has a capacity of 13.5 kWh and has an inbuilt Inverter \nof 5 kW. The cost per kWh of the battery with inverter is around 407 USD but after deducting \nthe cost of inverter, it is only 259 USD.;\n#3 DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECT PIPELINE USING DECISION TOOL\nThe type of projects that could be taken up for each RE technology, are identified through \na process that is developed specifically for this Roadmap and is presented here in the form \nof a Decision Tool. \n#3.1 Developing the project pipeline\nA 3-level process is developed for creating a pipeline of RE projects in Afghanistan ensuring \nRE resource are exploited by suitable system configurations. Level 1 takes into account the \ntechno-economical RE resource potential, grid availability, land availability and logistics \nwhich are very region-specific in Afghanistan. This process gives an idea about suitable RE \nresource and the implementing technology and also point at suitability of utility scale vs \noff-grid systems. The next Level 2, evaluates various factors such as existing load profiles, \nenergy consumption pattern, terrain characteristics, population densities, available energy \nresources, and other social factors to indicate mini-grids vs stand-alone system choices. \nLevel 3 discusses about requirements of actual implementation of RE projects by conducting \nsurveys, devising suitable business models, and involving existing institutions such as NGOs, \nMFIs, and CDCs.\nThe 3-level process evolves into a Decision Tool that is presented in this chapter. This \ndecision tool is aligned with the needs of the government, the project developers and the \nusers, and acts as a guiding principle to assist them in decision making. It is presented in \nthe form of a flow chart, supported by qualitative and quantitative parameters. The Decision \nTool can be linked with the GIS system for strategic planning of projects. \n#3.2 Decision process and levels \n#Level 1:\nAt level 1, Decision Tool aids the policy makers who are at the first level of the \ndecision-making hierarchy in deciding whether to plan for utility scale grid- connected or \noff-grid projects. The decision is aided by ensuring the feasible RE resource at the first step \nand grid availability or any grid extension plan in the near future for electricity evacuation. \nNext immediate factor to consider is availability of land and proper road connectivity to the \nproposed site for installation of a grid-connected/ utility-scale RE project. Finally, an \nimportant point for consideration is security of the proposed site as grid-scale project \ndevelopers would prefer safe and secured operating environment. Thus, this level serves as \na quick and practical indicator to decide between grid-connected/ utility scale or off-grid \nmarkets.\n#Level 2:\nThe outcome at level 1 is further evaluated to determine the most appropriate RE \nsystem configuration. A complete solution depends not only on the technical and financial \nparameters, which are quantitative in nature, but also on qualitative socio-economic \nparameters. The first indicator at this stage is the concentration of population to be served \nby the RE system. This gives an idea about the presence of load demand in the area. For \ninstance, stand-alone systems work well in locations with scattered population and \ndispersed demand. The second indicator is the existing load type that defines the prevalent \nelectricity consumer category- industrial, residential or rural, and government; and any \napplication-specific demand. Presence of other energy supplying sources such as diesel \nplants allows opting for RE-diesel hybrid mini-grid market. 46\n#Level 3:\nThe final level aids in realizing ease of implementation of the identified system \nconfiguration at levels 1 and 2. These are used to micro-site the project and evaluate the \nsocial acceptability and financial viability of the utility-scale, mini-grid or stand-alone RE \nproject. Ultimately, these parameters enable the project developers and the users in \ndeveloping a mutually agreed upon business model, thus suggesting project design for the \nproject pipeline.\n#3.4 Description of parameters\n#Applying 3-level process for developing project pipeline\n#1. Level 1\na. Check for RE resource potential from the RE resource maps.\nb. Check for grid availability and grid extension plan. If \u201cYes\u201d then utility scale \nprojects can come up. If \u201cNo\u201d, then mini-grid or stand-alone projects can come \nup. \nc. Then check for land availability, road connectivity, and security if \u201cutility-scale\u201d \nis the outcome above. If all are \u201cYes\u201d, then conclude at utility-scale projects and \nmove to Stage 3. \n#2. Level 2 \na. Check for population concentration and load type. If the answer for population is \n\u201cconcentrated\u201d and the load type is \u201cresidential, industrial, and government\u201d, \nthen RE mini-grid projects are possible. Also, check for other operational \nelectricity sources available in a particular region. If \u201cYes\u201d, then RE- hybrid mini\u0002grid projects are possible. \nb. If population is \u201cscattered\u201d and load type is \u201cresidential\u201d then stand-alone \nsystems are possible. Check for application specific demand such as for irrigation \npumps, and others, then stand-alone RE pumps are suggested.\n#3. Level 3 \na. For \u201cUtility-scale\u201d, enabling steps such micro-siting, grid-stability, actual land\navailability, etc. are taken up. \nb. For \u201cMini-grid\u201d, load distribution pattern, site topography etc. are to be studied.\nc. For \u201cstand-alone projects\u201d check for presence of NGO\u2019s, MFI\u2019s and CDC\u2019s that \nenable implementation through community preparedness, financing, creating \nawareness, etc. \n#3.5 Application of Decision Tool for creating the project pipeline\nThe Decision Tool and its 3-level process is a dynamic process which can be modified to \nsuite the changing RE market environment. The process is applied by considering the \nidentified RE potential, technology application, and suitable markets. \nAs per chapter 2, the recommended technologies for utility scale projects are solar, wind, \nbiomass, hydro and geothermal. Table 9 identifies provinces suitable for this market by \napplying the five criteria as in level-1 of the Decision Tool. Afghanistan National Grid Plan \nmap has been referred to at this level. (Annexure B)\nFurther, the provinces with no or limited grid availability but high solar radiation are \nconsidered ideal for mini-grid or stand-alone projects in level 2 of the Decision Tool. \nSubsequently, population concentration and load characteristics are used for identifying \npotential mini-grid projects. Highly populated provinces are assumed to contain load mix of \n\u201cresidential, industrial, commercial, and government\u201d. The presence of operating diesel \ngensets are prioritised for developing diesel-RE hybrid mini-grids with an understanding that \nit will immediately reduce the dependence on diesel, while simultaneously providing a \nreliable back-up or supplement power supply system to RE based mini-grid.\nAccordingly, all the provincial capitals and trade clusters are suitable to implement stand\u0002alone or DG-based hybrid SPV mini-grid projects. The exact sizing and technical design is to \nbe done on the basis of detailed feasibility for each project considering topography, demand \npattern, among others which takes the user to the third-level of the Decision Tool. \nFinally, stand-alone projects are designed and customised for specific sites and for specific \nloads, i.e. power packs for universities, solar pumps for irrigation or drinking water supply, \npower supply units for telecom towers, biomass gasifiers for community cooking or \nelectricity needs etc. The third level of the Decision Tool helps in conducting site specific \nstudies and analysis for all types of stand- alone projects, including user survey, stakeholder \nconsultations, enterprise development studies etc. \n#3.6 Prioritizing RE projects\nThe Decision Tool provides a method to create a project pipeline. However, deployment of \nRE projects may vary from each other on the basis of several considerations and hence, need \nto be prioritised. Some of these considerations would be:\n\u2022 Simplicity: How easy they are to construct, operate and maintain ;\n\u2022 Scalability: Whether they can be implemented across a variety of sizes and locations ;\n\u2022 Familiarity: What is their familiarity in Afghanistan on the basis of past experience;\n\u2022 Viability: Whether they are a financially sound option;\nThe above considerations are used in a customised knock-out criteria method34 to qualify \nthem as hot (high priority) and cold (low priority) and is applied below to prioritise the \ndeployment of some RETs and downgrade some others in the context of Afghanistan. \nThe High priority and strategically important projects and their achievable targets are \ndescribed here:\n#a) Solar PV utility scale \nThe Decision Tool points at setting up a total of 800 MW of solar utility scale PV through \nSolar Power Parks (SPPs) and Independent Power Producers (IPPs), with an optimum capacity \nof 100 MW for SPPs and 10 MW for IPPs. Land requirement will roughly be of the order to \n1250-1400 hectares for 800 MW. The proposed 100 MW SPP at Naghlu and 10 MW IPP at \nKandahar will be trailblazers in this segment. SPP model is discussed in details in next \nchapter. \n#b) Utility scale wind farms\nUtility scale wind power projects, commonly known as wind farms, both in power parks \nmode and IPP mode, are high priority projects and upto 600 MW capacity addition is \nrecommended using this technology. \n#c) Roof-top solar PV\nThis market segment is of strategic importance to Afghanistan\u2019s major cities and provincial \ncapitals on account of unmet captive demand and dependence on diesel genset in most of \ngovernment, public and private buildings, and available roof space. Assuming an average 1 \nkWp system on residential households and multiples of 10 kWp in public and private \ninstitutional buildings, an aggregate capacity of 420 MWp can be installed using this \ntechnology. The proposed 10 MWp roof-top PV project in Kabul would be the first-of-its \nkind, which will be followed by similar projects in other major towns and provincial capitals \nthat are/ will be connected to the national/ provincial grids.\n#d) Bio-methanation of municipal solid waste\nThe conversion of municipal solid waste into energy is of strategic importance to Afghanistan \nconsidering the amount of solid waste generated in major municipalities. For instance, Kabul \ngenerates approximately 1600 tonnes of MSW daily. The first proposed pilot project for 6.0 \nMW in Kabul municipality is an encouraging initiative. The Roadmap recommends more such \nprojects, totalling to about 56 MW aggregated installed capacity.\n#e) Mini-grids - Solar PV, MHP and hybrids\nMini-grids have emerged as viable alternative to grid extension for rural/ semi-urban \ncommunities\u2019 world over. Diesel based mini-grids are commonly used in Afghanistan, which \nneed to be either replaced or hybridized with solar, wind and MHP technologies. In addition, \nnew mini-grids need to be installed in load centers and provincial towns. Roadmap \nrecommends a total of 720 MW of installed capacities. About 25 mini-grids on average 500 \nkW capacities are being proposed under the ASERD programme of MRRD, which will kick\u0002start this segment. \n#f) Solar PV stand-alone systems, include solar pumping\nSolar PV stand-alone systems consisting of street lights, home lighting and domestic systems, \npower packs for telecom towers, solar pumps, portable lights and battery chargers are some \nof the systems that can play a critical role in improving energy access of rural communities. \nUpto 126 MWp worth of aggregate capacity can be installed in this segment as per this \nRoadmap. Private enterprises are already marketing these systems in Afghanistan.\nInitiatives such as \u2018Citizens\u2019 Charter Afghanistan Programme\u2019 will provide a further boost to \nthis segment. \n#g) Non-concentrating solar thermal systems\nGiven the requirement of hot-water (and low-grade heat) for domestic, community and \ncommercial purposes throughout the year in Afghanistan, non-concentrating solar thermal \nsystems (flat-plate or ETC) can play a critical role in providing thermal energy to these \napplications. Accordingly, Roadmap suggests a total target of 60 MW under this category.\n#h) Biogas and improved cookstoves for cooking energy\nIn addition to solar thermal systems, biogas and improved cookstoves will make a significant \ncontribution in thermal energy sector by providing clean energy for cooking. This Roadmap \nsuggests a deployment of such systems with an aggregate capacity of around 6.7 MW.\n#i) Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) \nAlthough CSP has not yet been introduced in Afghanistan, it is a proven technology and there \nare operational power plants globally as well as in the region. Since the solar radiation \nlevels, particularly DNI levels are high in Afghanistan, at least a few pilot CSP plants are \nrecommended to be set up in any one the provinces high with solar radiations levels. Most \ncommonly sized capacity amongst operational CSP plants globally is 50 MW. \n#j) Floating PV (Floatovoltaics)\nThough a relatively new concept world-wide, there are already 70 FPV projects currently \noperational, most of these in Japan. The sizes range from as small as 5 kWp to the largest \none being 20 MWp. Most of these FPV plants are installed on reservoirs. Considering the fact \nthat Afghanistan has significant numbers of reservoirs and dams for irrigational and \nelectricity generation purposes, this Roadmap recommends setting up of 10.5 MWp of \nfloating PV plants of varying capacities on the basis of detailed feasibility studies, including \nEnvironmental-Social Impacts Assessment (ESIA) studies. \n#k) Large hydro projects\nLarge hydro projects are now being considered as renewable energy projects. Their \ncontribution to Afghanistan\u2019s total energy mix is significant. While the plan for installing \nlarge hydro projects under NSSP is already underway, this Roadmap recommends focussing \non nearly 1750 MW worth of projects that are stalled due to several reasons.\nWith these and other projects being commissioned, 2000 MW of additional renewable energy \ncapacity can be added. \n#4 BUSINESS MODELS FOR RE PROJECTS IN AFGHANISTAN\nThe renewable energy market in Afghanistan is still in its nascent stages. As a result, \nstructured business models, which characterize mature markets, are not yet in place. The \nmarket landscape is dominated by government programmes, supported by bilateral or \nmultilateral development partners. The private sector acts as turnkey or installation \ncontractors, with little or no financial liabilities in the project.\nHowever, the introduction of RENP and feed-in tariffs for connecting such projects to the \ngrid has given a fillip to the sector. As a result, there is a push for structured and \nstandardized business models, aimed at engaging key stakeholders (private sector, \ngovernment and communities) to exploit win-win possibilities in the market. \nThis chapter seeks to present business models relevant to Afghanistan, which are in sync \nwith the national context. These could be introduced so as to guide and steer renewable \nenergy development in a structured manner. Importantly, implementation of the business \nmodels shall serve to engage the private sector, thereby infusing private capital in the \nmarket.\nAs discussed in the subsequent chapters, development of the RE sector shall take place in \nstages. Each stage is the outcome of policy directions issued by government, and the \nresultant response from the private sector and other stakeholders. As the Stage-Gate model \nlater explains in next chapter, the expansion of the RE sector and its components follows \nthe 3 stages of market seeding, market creation and market transformation. This chapter \nalso attempts to demonstrate how, and to what extent, the implementation of business \nmodels helps in transformation of the markets in each stage.\n#4.1 From markets to business models \nThe renewable energy market in Afghanistan is segregated into three categories (i.e. utility \nscale, mini-grids, and stand-alone) each addressing a specific objective of the Roadmap as \npresented below:\n#Large, utility scale\nThe large-scale project landscape is dominated by state run power generation units and \nindependent power producers. The business model for large power producers is based on \nconsiderations of assured and long-term power off-take. Financing is also a key requirement \ngiven the capital-intensive nature of power plants. In addition, producers need proper \ninfrastructure to set up their MW scale power plants. Thus, the power purchase agreement \n(PPA) assumes primary importance for large scale, MW scale power plants. \n#Small and medium, micro-utility or mini-grid application\nIn this segment, the operator manages a self-contained grid (resembling a micro utility), it\nhas to manage loads and ensure that outages are minimized to improve the viability of the \nproject. Load development and management is a key feature of business models in this \nsegment.\nThe business model requires the entrepreneur to make investments in power generation \nand/or distribution systems that would optimally serve its command area. This segment is \nalso marked by use of new technologies and the application of ICT enabled features to \nensure optimality in production and distribution.58\n#Micro, standalone systems \nThe standalone segment has seen some market movement via outright purchases of solar \npowered home systems. However, this market is largely non-formal and lacks quality \nassurances. The segment has significant potential in Afghanistan with the centralized grid \nnot being a cost-effective option in several pockets of the country dominated by \nmountainous terrain and spatially dispersed communities. \nWith this generic categorization of markets, the approach adopted in developing business \nmodels for Afghanistan is to bring the understanding of what has worked globally, and \ncustomize it to the local Afghan context. For each market segment, the following section \nidentifies business models customized in the Afghan context. \n#4.2 Solar Power Parks (SPP)\n#Description\nSPP is a dedicated and demarcated zone for development of solar PV power projects. Several \npower producers operate within a SPP. The park provides project developers with proper \ninfrastructure and access to facilities for power generation and export to the grid against a \nfirm Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). In doing so, project development risks are minimized \nfor the individual developer. SPPs facilitate developers by reducing the number of required \napprovals. The solar park is typically developed and operated by a Special Purpose Vehicle \nor a service provider, usually called the Solar Power Park Developer or SPPD. \nWhile this section discusses the SPPs, similar approach may also be considered for setting \nup of wind power parks/farms. \n#Salient features \nAs defined above, a single SPP can accommodate several projects promoted by a number of \nprivate sector entities, all facing roughly similar conditions for power generation and sale, \nwhich are governed in their individual power purchase agreements signed with the off-taker, \nsuch as DABS in this case. The activity of setting up the infrastructure for a SPP is generally \nanchored by a government entity. This entity, in the role of the SPPD, executes the \nfollowing:\n\u2022 Acquisition of land and developing it for SPP;\n\u2022 Getting land related clearances and approvals that are required to convert it to land \nsuitable for SPP development;\n\u2022 Developing approach roads, water supply and distribution, drainage and other \nrelated infrastructure to each project within the SPP;\n\u2022 Creating the power transmission network within the park and maintaining it; also \nsetting up power evacuation infrastructure to connect to the grid;\n\u2022 Providing security for SPP;\nAfter execution of these tasks, the project developers are invited to invest in setting up \nsolar PV projects through a bidding process. Projects are set up through Build-Own-Operate\u0002Maintain (BOOM) process. Project developers are expected to undertake investments related \nto setting up and maintaining the projects over the tenure of their PPAs. Projects may be \ntransferred to the government upon expiry of PPA.\nIn addition, the following features may be relevant in the specific context of Afghanistan:\n\u2022 Specific policies for SPPs are required, to provide regulatory support to private \nsector/other stakeholders. These could be generic, or tailored to suit the needs of a \nspecific SPP.;\n\u2022 A corporate body is needed to act as the SPPD. This could be a subsidiary of a utility \nor any other PPP arrangement. This corporate body shall need to develop its own \nbusiness plan, outlining revenues, costs and a plan to break even over the long run.;\n\u2022 Larger scale solar projects need to be encouraged in view of their higher potential \nto bring down the cost of power generation. This is because capital costs per MW of \ndeveloping solar PV projects reduce with an increase in project scale. ;\n\u2022 The land in SPP shall be leased to project developers. The tenure of such leases shall \nbe equal to the duration of the PPA.;\n\u2022 Power purchase is governed by the PPA between each project developer and the \nutility i.e. DABS. Feed-in tariffs may be used to pre-determine tariffs for SPPs. In \naddition, tariffs could be announced by the government in advance or determined \nas part of a bidding process. ;\n\u2022 Power is evacuated as must-take, purchased by the national transmission utility, \nDABS. Standards for metering and connectivity to grid shall follow the guidelines set \nout in Electricity Law and other relevant guidance documents.;\n\u2022 PPA tenures may extend to 20 to 25 years, with suitable clauses governing tariff \nmovements over time.;\n\u2022 Projects shall have well-defined pathways after the expiry of the PPA. These \npathways could include sale of asset to government, extension of PPA and others. ;\nIn terms of the institutional engagement in SPPs, major responsibilities of different \ninstitutions are expected to pan out as follows:\n\u2022 Power sector regulatory body: The regulator shall define conditions for power \nevacuation (must-run and must-take), long term access, PPA and others.;\n\u2022 Ministry of Energy and Water: Policy direction for setting up of the SPPs. These shall \nbe classified under separate notification for a \u201cSPP Scheme\u201d. ;\n\u2022 Special Purpose Vehicle: Govt. may set up a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in the \nPPP mode (similar to AISA) for setting up and managing SPPs, like a Solar Power Park \nDeveloper (SPPD). This agency shall be entrusted with the task of setting up and \nmanaging the SPPs, and shall execute the following activities:\no Preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) for each SPP;\no Site development for SPPs as indicated above;\no Facilitate single-window clearance for SPPs;\no Maintenance of the SPPs;\no Providing security for SPPs;;\nInvestments made by this agency can be realized from lease rentals and other fees \nagainst services that are paid by project developers. \n\u2022 Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS): DABS shall, as the transmission and \ndistribution utility, shall finalize tariff rates for procurement of power from SPPs and \nprocure the power. Wherever necessary, escrow mechanisms may also be set up to\nprovide revenue assurance to project developers.;\n\u2022 Project Developer: The project developer shall set up its solar PV project and \noperate and maintain the same throughout the life of the PPA. Depending upon the \nterms of agreement, after expiry of the PPA the developer may hand over the project \nto the government.;\nThe significant advantage of the SPP in Afghanistan is that it can unlock private capital \nthrough the engagement of the private sector in the generation of MW scale power in the \ncountry. Thus, it would largely eliminate the need for national and/or provincial \ngovernments to invest their resources in power generation, whether centrally or in \ndecentralised fashion. \nFurthermore, with the right incentive structures, the SPP model may be able to generate \nrevenues for government agencies such as the SPPD. Finally, the SPP model is designed for \nlocations where land is plentifully available. This shall build infrastructure such as roads, \npower and water lines to the site and around, thus developing the local micro-economy and \nresulting in decentralised development and reversing the course of migration.\nGlobal experience demonstrates that SPPs or solar farms are typically around 100\u2013200 MW \nin size, although SPPs of around 750 MW have recently been commissioned in Rewa, Madhya \nPradesh. There are over twenty (20) countries, which have set up SPPs. However, in USA, \nChina and India SPPs have tended to be larger in size, especially those installed in the past \nfew years (2012 onwards). Importantly these countries started off with 100 MW size parks, \nand gradually moved up in scale with time.\nThe following schematic shows the SPP in terms of process flows and roles/ responsibilities \nof various actors.\n#4.3 Distribution Franchisee (DF)\n#Description\nA Distribution Franchisee (DF) is an entity authorised by a distribution utility to distribute \nelectricity on its behalf, in a particular area within the utility\u2019s area of supply. The DF may \ninvest in improvements in the existing distribution network to improve technical and \ncommercial losses, better power quality and improved overall service delivery.\nThe DF business model works around a cluster of consumers such as industrial parks and \nmunicipalities, with DABS as generator and an independent qualified entity as the DF. \nExamples of DF could be the industrial park union, association of residents of a housing \nsociety, or any private agency interested in purchasing power from DABS (generator) and \ndistributing it within the mandated zone (park, housing society etc.).\n#Charanka Solar Park in Gujarat, India\nThe experience of neighbouring India on solar power parks has been noteworthy. Under \nthe aegis of the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), as many as 33 SPPs, with a \ncumulative capacity of 19,900 MW are either operational or under implementation. SECI \nhas identified nodal agencies in prominent Indian states where solar power parks are \nplanned. These nodal agencies form joint ventures with SECI and act as the SPPD\nThe Charanka Solar Park with an installed capacity of 590 MW was set up in the Indian \nstate of Gujarat, by the Gujarat Power Corporation Limited. The park, located in Patan \ndistrict, is spread over 5,384 acres of unused land. By the end of 2016, Charanka solar \npark has installed capacity of nearly 350 MW (March 2016). \nAmong the first solar PV parks to be installed in India, Charanka has been developed as \npart of Gujarat solar parks. Policy support for solar power parks in India was derived from \nthe Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM), which laid down the broad \nobjectives and guidelines. \nSubsequently, the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) was set up by the Ministry of \nNew and Renewable Energy (Ministry of New and Renewable Energy), Government of \nIndia. States interested in developing solar parks has to set up a Special Purpose Vehicle, \ngenerically called a Solar Power Park Developer (SPPD), who could form a joint venture \nwith SECI, or choose to remain an independent agency. As a third option, the individual \nstate could give responsibility to SECI to become the agency within the state. The choice \nof technology and identification of entrepreneurs within \na solar park may be kept open and subjected to a bidding \nprocess.\nThe SPPD is responsible for setting up the solar park with \nthe required infrastructure. For Charanka, the Gujarat \nPower Corporation Limited acted as the SPPD. With its \noverall mandate for power development, and considering \nfavorable wind speeds in Charanka, few wind turbines \nwere also commissioned to generate additional power.\nThe distribution franchisee can operate in several ways. It can use a basic model for \noperation and maintenance services against a commission or a fee, where the DF is \nresponsible for billing, maintenance and collection activities. It can also have an advanced \nmodel where the DF invests in the local grid, improves technical performance and reduces \nAggregate Technical & Commercial (ATC) losses, thereby providing 24x7 quality power at a \npremium. For energy-deficit industrial areas and parks in Afghanistan, the DF approach \ncould be a cost-effective solution to meeting the industries\u2019 needs of quality, low to high \nvoltage power demand.\n#Salient features \nThe DF business model necessarily includes a generator that is owned by an entity different \nfrom the DF. The generator such as DABS (national utility) is then responsible for selling \nbulk power to DF for a pre-demarcated territory. The salient features are as follows:\n\u2022 The utility sells electricity to the DF at a single point (such as a transformer) at a pre\u0002agreed, bulk tariff that is governed by a power purchase agreement. DF distributes \nelectricity to individual consumers at pre-agreed consumer tariff. This step assures the \nutility of payments from the DF, and thus de-risks it from engaging with a multitude of \nconsumers. Usually, the DF is appointed in a zone where utility faces challenges in \nservicing the customer profitably.;\n\u2022 The utility and DF enter into a long-term time bound contractual agreement wherein \nutility commits to supplying electricity to the DF. DF commits to undertaking Billing, \nMetering and Collection (BMC) activities, or making required investments / \nimprovements in the distribution network, as the case may be.;\n\u2022 The DF represents the utility on the ground and is provided with security and other \nadministrative support. This is especially relevant in the context of Afghanistan, where \nlocal security issues could be present in certain provinces. The DF could be a local entity \nfamiliar with site-specific dynamics, which would assist in de-risking revenue collection \nand establishment of business ties with community members.;\n\u2022 The DF may invest in setting up / upgrading / strengthening the distribution network, \nwhich may belong to the utility. Its investments include:\no Installing transformers, feeders and conducting continuous maintenance of the \nnetwork ;\no Enhancing safety and security of the network by installing protective measures;\no Reducing theft and other commercial losses;\no Installing smart meters at consumers\u2019 ends and maintaining a helpline to enhance \ncustomer care;;\n\u2022 The DF may invest in additional back-up power generation options to provide 24x7 power \nto the consumers. This is more relevant for industrial and urban consumers;\n\u2022 DF realizes its returns on above investments by charging pre-agreed consumer tariffs, \nthat are usually at a premium (in return for better service delivery);\n\u2022 Benefits to consumers served by the DF include improved power supply (both \nqualitatively and quantitatively) and improved complaint redressal;\n\u2022 Benefits to utility include assured revenue collection (from a single-bulk-consumer) and \nreduced manpower deployment costs in the zone where DF operates ;\n\u2022 DF benefits from financial returns from a performance turnaround in its zone, and may \nlook to expand operations to similar zones. It also enjoys a customer base for 10-15 \nyears, which will offer opportunities for further business expansion;\nRoles and responsibilities of various agencies in the DF model are explained below:\n\u2022 Regulator: Lays down guidelines within the Electricity Law for defining and setting up \ndistribution franchisees in Afghanistan ;\n\u2022 Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW): Designs the DF Scheme in Pan-Afghanistan context \nalong the above guidelines and provides policy support for its roll- out;\n\u2022 Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS): Identify areas where power distribution can \nbe licensed to DF. Enters into contract for sale of power and for the maintenance of \nDABS\u2019s distribution infrastructure in the area now under the franchisee\u2019s operations. 64\nDABS shall provide necessary support to DF on the ground in the form of security and \nany other administrative / legal support as and when required;\n\u2022 Distribution Franchisee (DF): Invests in, operates and maintains the distribution \ninfrastructure over the tenure of its terms of agreement with DABS. Provides services to \nthe consumers in the manner outlined in its terms of agreement;\n\u2022 Consumers: Enter into agreement with the DF and pay tariffs as agreed upon.;\nDF models have been successful across several countries, as a de-risking mechanism that \nenables both the generator and the franchisee to build on their individual competencies in \na strategic, mutually beneficial scenario. In the neighbouring country, India for example, \nTorrent Power Limited (TPL) launched one of the first input based distribution franchisee \noperations in Bhiwandi circle of Maharashtra in western India. Reviewed by an independent \nagency, the model has successfully shown that aggregate technical and commercial (ATC) \nlosses coming down from a high of 58% in 2007 to 18.5% in 2011, and around 20% as of 2015, \nproviding profitable solutions for all stakeholders. Importantly, TPL has a ten-year mandate \nin Bhiwandi Circle, which is needed for it to recover its investments and make returns.\n#4.4 Roof-top solar PV through net metering\n#Description\nIn Afghanistan, there is significant potential of roof-top solar PV systems on account of levels \nof solar radiation consistently above 5.5 kWh/m2as well as available roof-top space, \nespecially in urban locations. With largely low-rise architecture prevalent in the cities and \ntowns, there is ample opportunity for development of roof-top solar PV projects due to \nabundance of sunshine. On the demand side, lack of reliable energy access coupled with \nhigh demand for electrical energy for lighting and other applications provide a ready market \nfor roof-top based solar PV systems. With the advantage of net metering, households can \nalso sell unused electricity back to the grid and provide more power for distribution. \nNet metering facility allows the user to export power from the solar PV unit as and when \nsuch power is unutilized. Similarly, if power supplied from the solar PV unit falls short of \ncurrent demand at the user\u2019s end, then the user draws electricity from the grid. At the end \nof a billing cycle (typically a month), the net power consumed / exported by the user is \ncalculated (using the net meter), and the user either paid or charged accordingly. Net \nmetering allows the user to partially recover its investment by selling surplus electricity \ngenerated.\n#Salient features \nThere are two main business models used in roof-top solar: CAPEX and OPEX models\n\u2022 CAPEX model:\no The Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) model involves the owner of the roof and \nelectricity distributor (DABS, in this case). The owner purchases all the \nnecessary equipment for the generation of roof-top solar and sells the \nelectricity generated to the distributor via a net-metering mechanism ;\no The operation and maintenance (O&M) of the system is generally done by an \nexternal contractor hired by the owner;\no The roof-top owner can enjoy government tax benefits and incentives for \ngenerating clean power;;\n\u2022 OPEX model:\no The Operational Expenditure (OPEX) model involves the owner of the roof, a \nthird-party implementation company and the electricity distributor. The roof \nowner rents out their roof to a third party in order for them to generate \nelectricity from solar PV panels. The third party sells the electricity \ngenerated to the distribution company. In turn, the owner collects rent from \nthe third party, after taking into account any other arrangements, like \nelectricity purchase, profit-sharing, etc. Alternatively, the roof owner can \nget into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the third party, in order to \nget electricity for their building at a lower rate;\no The maintenance of the system is handled by either the third-party developer \nor by the roof-top owner, depending on the agreement between them;\no The third-party developer enjoys government tax benefits and incentives as \ngenerator of clean power ;\no In the case of Afghanistan, DABS could also become the third-party so as to \ngenerate more grid-connected energy at a relatively low cost;;\nTo ensure long-term sustainability of roof-top solar PV systems, distribution companies \npurchasing power through net metering, for instance, shall need to ensure \ncomplementarities in power interface with the utility (DABS) grid, so that there is seamless \nintegration with national power systems and management of local interconnection issues. \nMoreover, the financial health of the utility such as DABS is vital to secure revenues for the \nseller.\nThe institutional framework for roof-top solar is a mix between standalone captive systems \nand a grid-tied solar PV system. Like grid-tied systems, feed-in tariffs play an important \nrole. At the same time, the model is based on a single consumer, similar to standalone \nsystems. Afghanistan in currently establishing its net metering policy, which will catalyse \nthe roof-top market. Figure below presents the model.\nGlobally, the European Union and especially Germany has been a proven leader in roof-top \nsolar power development. In terms of regional success stories, roof-top solar PV schemes \nare popular in India and Sri Lanka within the South Asian region. In Sri Lanka, the net \nmetering policy is open to all generators of renewable energy (hydropower, solar etc.) with \na cap of 1,000 kW per user. The excess power sold to the grid is valued at the PPA and \ncredited to the user in terms of energy credits, with the user to have flexibility on when \nuser chooses to monetise them. In addition, countries where roof-top solar PV are present \nhave introduced prior regulation to facilitate setting up of these systems.\n#The German Roof-top success story\nWith a total generation of 36.6 terawatt-hours (TWh; equivalent to 36,600 GWh) from \nsolar PV in 2015, and a total installed capacity of 29.6 GW (29,600 MW) exclusively \nthrough solar PV roof-tops, Germany has over 7% of its total electricity demand being \nfed by solar systems.\nGermany\u2019s solar roof-top installations are characterized by less than 10 kW units, \nmounted on the roof of a house. Beginning from a stage of negligible solar PV capacity \nin the 1990s, the country has targeted 45,000 GWh by 2020. Importantly, the approach \nputs importance on roof-top as a key enabler. Today, the roof-top segment contributes \nalmost 75% of Germany\u2019s PV capacity. Germany\u2019s EnergieWiende claims that \ninvestments in solar PV have helped the economy phase out nuclear power plants.\nBehind this significant success lies the Renewable Energy Guarantee Act that guarantees \npriority grid access to all electricity generated by renewables. In addition, policies \nsignificantly incentivize owners to mount solar roof-top systems, through Feed-in-Tariffs \n(FiT). While in the initial years the FiT was high so as to encourage homeowners to mount \nsolar PV in their roof-tops, more recently (2014) the policy is tweaked to ensure \nauctioning of tariffs, which presents a more competitive picture.\nAs per German EnergieWiende, the opening up of the solar PV market also had significant \nco-benefits. These were in terms of employment generation, greening of the energy \nsector, combating climate change impacts in Germany and Europe. Being roof-top \ninstalled, the aesthetic appeal of the houses was also not hampered, since roof-top units \nare usually not visible from the ground.\n#4.5 Renewable (Rural) Energy Service Company (RESCO)\n#Description\nRESCO is an entity that provides energy services to consumers in a particular area by setting \nup a mini-utility, usually in an off-grid location. As a mini-utility, RESCO combines both \ngeneration and distribution functions. The RESCO business model is built on enhancing \ncommunity level incomes through reliable and affordable energy access. These incomes pay \nfor energy consumed, sustaining the micro-utility function.\nIn the Afghanistan context, there are several areas where the national utility (DABS) may \nencounter difficulty in providing reliable electricity access. These are pockets best served \nby decentralised, renewable energy based systems. RESCO projects, acting as a complete \nmicro-or mini-utility by combining generation and distribution services under a single roof, \ncan meet power demand and contribute to local growth by facilitating enterprise \ndevelopment. \nThus, RESCO models are more relevant in areas characterized by high levels of unmet \ndemand for energy, usually for agriculture (irrigation), farm-based enterprises (cold storage \nand drying) and anchor loads (24x7 demand such as telecom, market centers and hospitals) \nalong with high population densities.\n#Salient features\nThe broad features of the RESCO business model are as follows:\n\u2022 The RESCO mirrors a utility on the ground. Typically, RESCO sets up a cluster of \nprojects in a district to reduce management overheads and ensure viability. RESCO \nbusinesses undertake several pre-project activities such as site selection, load and \nenterprise development, feasibility study preparation and engineering design. For \npower generation, RESCO utilizes locally available RE resources such as solar, \nbiomass and wind.;\n\u2022 Power is sold to consumers across all load categories, viz. household, commercial \n(shops) and enterprises. ;\n\u2022 RESCOs are assisted by local entities such as Civil Society Organizations (CSO) and \nother community based organizations. These entities play important roles in project \nidentification, community mobilization, load development and tariff fixation. CSOs, \nlargely being local, build trust bridges between RESCO and communities. Security \nand other administrative support relevant in the local context are managed by the \nRESCO with the support of CSO / local partner.;\n\u2022 To ensure long-term sustainability of operations, RESCOs can ensure \ncomplementarities in interface between the mini-grids constructed by them and the \nutility (DABS) grid, so that there is seamless integration with the national grid as and \nwhen it reaches in future.;\n\u2022 From a financing perspective, RESCOs are often implemented as public-private \npartnerships with government agencies (MRRD, MEW etc.) providing support to \nRESCOs to reduce their risk exposure levels.;\n\u2022 One of the key aspects leading to the success of a RESCO is the presence of an anchor \nload. An anchor load is defined as a load type that can provide sustained demand for \npower generated from the RESCO project. Other intermittent or seasonal loads can \nthen be built around the anchor load to provide stability and higher levels of capacity\nutilization. For instance, telecom towers have 24x7 demand and can act as anchor \nloads. Another good example is that of cold storages that need power round the \nclock. ;\n\u2022 Significant benefits to the community (as consumers) accrue through a RESCO project \nthrough sustainable energy access, especially for enterprise development. This also \nleads to economic growth in the nearby region. With a \u201cclustering\u201d approach, district \nlevel impacts are also possible.;\n\u2022 RESCO benefits from revenues earned by powering various loads in the area under \nits command. It also forges a long-term relationship with communities in the region, \nwhich will help to scale up the business to other locations. The RESCO also gains \nknowledge of various aspects of an energy-based business.;\n\u2022 Benefits to government accrue through provision of environmentally sustainable \nenergy in un-electrified areas, thereby complementing government efforts.;\nThe RESCO business model has strong potential in Afghanistan, mostly because decentralised \nenergy is expected to contribute significantly in the country\u2019s overall energy sector. In the \nprocess of setting up the RESCO, the following institutional roles are envisaged:\n\u2022 Regulator: The regulator shall demarcate regions within Afghanistan where grid may \nnot reach in a certain foreseeable future. These shall ring-fence zones where RESCO \ncan operate. It would also open up the market for private sector players to act as \npotential RESCOs. ;\n\u2022 Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) & Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation & \nDevelopment (MRRD): As RESCOs are widely expected to be set up in rural\necosystems, MRRD would play an important role in institutionalizing this business \nmodel in all its energy programmes. MEW will set up guidelines for technical design, \nsafety and quality of power delivered for RESCO projects. MEW shall also carry out \ncapacity building activities for RESCOs. MRRD can empanel potential RESCO \norganizations and work in tandem with relevant Community Development Councils \nand other grassroots organizations to identify RESCO project opportunities. Capacity \ndevelopment of RESCOs can also be jointly taken up by the two ministries along with \nDABS.;\n\u2022 Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS): DABS shall, as the transmission utility, lay \ndown guidelines for interconnection of distribution networks for mini-utilities\nprojects with the grid, so as to facilitate seamless transition in the event of grid \ninterface. DABS shall build capacities of RESCOs on technical and commercial aspects \nof the distribution business including billing, metering and collection activities.;\n\u2022 RESCO: The role of the RESCO encompasses building, operating and maintaining the \nmicro-utility ecosystem throughout the life of the PPAs signed with various \nconsumers.;\n\u2022 Consumers: Enter into agreement with RESCO and pay tariffs as agreed upon.\nWith this above background, the following diagram shows a flow diagram of how the RESCO \nis expected to operate.\nIn Afghanistan, RESCO projects are assumed to be in the 100 kW \u2013 1,000 kW range, in terms \nof installed capacity. A typical RESCO project is expected to cover 3 \u2013 7 villages, thereby \nconnecting between 1,000 - 2,000 households or roughly 6,000 \u2013 15,000 individuals. This \nscale is higher than normal RESCO projects in the South Asian region (which vary between\n10 kW \u2013 500kW). One major reason behind this is that a number of districts and rural areas \nare expected to remain disconnected from the national grid, thereby allowing larger scale \nRESCO projects.\nGlobal success on RESCO projects is based upon private enterprise in off-grid locations, \nwhere entrepreneurship sets up its own micro-utility to provide electricity solutions. More \nprevalent is the diesel generator operator, who functions as an energy service provider using \ndiesel generator sets, essentially providing lighting energy to markets in Asia and Africa. \nIn India, the Rockefeller Foundation has been at the center of empowering rural \ncommunities with environmentally sustainable energy supply options through the well\u0002known SPEED programme.\n#The SPEED Story\nSmart Power for Environmentally-sound Economic Development (SPEED), an initiative by the \nRockefeller Foundation to connect remote, rural households in India with renewable energy \nbased systems.\nThe SPEED model is structured around empowering enterprises, and is built around the \nconcept of anchor loads. Anchor loads allow a generating station to perform at higher levels \nof capacity utilization. The programme sought to support Energy Service Companies (ESCO) \nto enter the rural energy market, a segment marked with high transaction costs relative to \nvolume.\nOver the past 6 years since 2010, the SPEED programme (and now its successor the Smart \nPower for Rural Development) has worked with over 50 ESCO organisations, contributing to \nits goal to energize 1,000 Indian villages \nwith \u2018smart power\u2019.\nThe rural mini-grids are equipped with \nefficient LED lights, prepaid meters and \ntamper proof distribution networks that \nensure safety and security. Several micro\u0002enterprises have been energized, viz \ntelecom towers, drying and processing \nunits, small garment making businesses, \ncold storages, training centres and \nnumerous shops. Agricultural pumping has \nalso been a major beneficiary.\n#4.6 Pay-as-you-go or Micro-finance based standalone systems\nA stand-alone solar PV system is a modular, photovoltaic-based electrification system that \nprovides amenity power for a captive consumer, typically a household. Being modular in \nnature, the stand-alone system is often designed to suit the needs of the customer. The \nbusiness model sustains on providing reliable, easy-to-afford energy access at the household \nlevel. Using pay-as-you-go or microfinance based financing models, these systems provide\nbasic electricity supply at negligible upfront costs. For affluent users, larger and more \nsophisticated systems can be introduced.\nThere are several versions and variants that may be adapted for stand-alone models. This \nsection shall attempt to highlight some of the best practices followed globally, seeking to \ncapture the various nuances involved in these systems. \n#Salient features\nOverall, the following salient features broadly describe the stand-alone, home based solar \nPV systems business model:\n\u2022 Stand-alone systems are provided as either one-time outright purchase or a hire-to\u0002purchase or a pay-as-you-go model. Hire-to-purchase as well as pay-as-you-go models \nhave sequenced ownership rights.;\n\u2022 The model may typically comprise a technical entity (who could be the manufacturer \nitself) entrusted with the design of systems, and a implementation partner who \nidentifies and engages with end users. Optionally, a financial intermediary may be \ninvolved. ;\n\u2022 Stand-alone models are typically characterized by the presence of ICT enabled, \n\u2018smart\u2019 features. These may include systems that are integrated with central servers \nthrough Radio Frequency tags, prepaid usage, \u201cblack box\u201d designs etc. ;\n\u2022 The models exhibit optimal and efficient energy use devices such as LED lights, \nenergy efficient fans, multi-function devices (chargeable lantern\u2013cum\u2013torch\u2013cum\u2013FM \nradio; or a hand-cranked or bicycle powered battery to provide supplementary \ncharge). These features also make the stand-alone device a lifestyle tool. ;\n\u2022 In order to cater to a large number of customers, the routes to market adoption for \nstand-alone systems often involve innovative channels. While most manufacturers \nuse the NGO \u2013 community based organization (CBO) route, there are other models \nthat have utilized existing distribution channels for petroleum products (Reliance \nSolar), or linking with education programmes (Kotak Urja) in India, or selling energy \ncoupled to other infrastructure services such as water (as done by Grundfos in \nAfrica39). Yet, others have developed their own dealer-distributor networks.;\n\u2022 To ensure scale up of stand-alone home-based systems a financing partner is needed. \nThe partner partly resolves cash flow issues for the end user and the technical \npartner or the implementing agency. Typically, the financing partner extends micro\u0002credit to the user. Financing of the systems by the technical partner and/or \nimplementing agency is also common. As these systems replace fossil fuels such as \nkerosene, the financing terms are tuned to ensure that financial savings from avoided \nfuel expenses are utilized to pay monthly lease rentals for the stand-alone systems. \nIn addition, there are significant advantages in terms of avoided indoor emissions \nfrom kerosene use, in addition to GHG emission reductions.;\n\u2022 Stand-alone models are often implemented as public-private partnerships, with the \ngovernment providing investment support to implementing partners. These forms a \nwin-win solution for government who are unable to extend the main grid to remote \nareas.;\n\u2022 Communities (as consumers) accrue significant benefits through a stand-alone \nsystem from household energy access, especially for education and improving the \nquality of life for the family. ;\n\u2022 Implementing agencies and technical partners benefit from accessing a larger user \nbase. In deferred payment models, user charges typically run for 60\u201384 months, \nwithin which the user has invariably increased its demand so as to ask for a second\u2013\nor a larger\u2013system. In presence of microfinance agencies in the SS model, such trends \nare significantly more pronounced. ;\nUnlike other business models, the stand-alone system market does not require much\nregulatory provisions: broadly this market is characterized by transaction between a service \nprovider (commonly the implementing agency) and a customer. However, there are \nstrategic roles played by institutional players that determine the success of this market. \nThese are outlined below:\n\u2022 Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW): MEW can set up guidelines for household scale \nsystems, specifying technical design, safety and power delivered from a given \nsystem. MEW can also carry out capacity building activities for implementing \nagencies and provide support to technical partners. ;\n\u2022 Microfinance (MF) or financing entity: The financing entity often holds the key to \nany large-scale programme. The role of the MF entity is typically to ensure that cash \nflows are positive for the implementing entity (typically the intermediary who as the \nimplementing agency is the interface between the manufacturer and user). At the \nsame time, by providing upfront cash for the systems on behalf of the seller, the MF \nenters into a financing agreement with the end user, allowing him to make small \nrepayments every month. In pay-as-you-go systems, the financing entity may finance \nthe implementing agency with a debt-equity combination, which de-risks the \nimplementer from delayed payments. The user, who is not financed, pays off for the \nsystem every month through user charges. These charges typically run for 60 \u2013 84 \nmonths, following which the user owns the asset;\n\u2022 The Implementing Agency: This agency plays a central role in putting together the \nentire programme. At the sourcing end, it interacts with financial institutions to \nensure microfinance and other financial tie-ups. At the same time, it works closely \nwith manufacturers to ensure that devices being sold cater to the needs of the \nconsumers. Finally, it controls the operational aspects of the programme to ensure \nsmooth performance, absence of leakages (systems being sold to wrong end-users, \nstolen, or traded internally for arbitrage etc.). Crucially, the implementing agency \nis responsible for overall after-sales service and maintenance performance of the \nprogramme as well. In many cases, the implementing agency is multi-tiered: \ninvolving two or three levels. Large programmes (at a national level) require an apex \nentity, supported by entities at the provincial level such as NGOs or CSOs;\n\u2022 Consumers: Consumers can be simple end-users, who can undertake outright \npurchase of a system. They can also participate in the programme under a deferred \npayment or a pay-as-you-go model.;\nThe schematic flowchart above outlines the overall process and identifies roles and \nresponsibilities of various stakeholders in a simplified version of the standalone system.\nIn the Afghanistan context, stand-alone solar PV has been widely in use across rural areas, \ndriven largely by lack of options for electricity supply. Most of these systems are assembled \nout of imported components or systems from neighbouring countries. As a result, these units \nusually are not certified, and could be of questionable quality.\nStand-alone devices are expected to have significant impact in Afghanistan in the years to \ncome, especially with participation from microfinance agencies. As a result, the \nimplementation of the business models for stand-alone systems could also have far-reaching \nimpacts. Perceived as a low-risk intervention and already present in the local markets, \nvarious agencies are in the process of introducing state-of-the-art stand-alone systems for \nthe Afghan market, through a financial intermediary.\nThe implementation of business models requires generic as well as specific support in \nterms of policy readiness, financing, technical-cum-managerial capacities among \nothers. These ecosystem enablers are critical for initiation and sustainability of \nbusiness models. The next chapter of the Roadmap presents these enablers and their \nrole in stage-wise development and maturity of RE markets.\n#The Azuri Pay-as-you-go Model in Sub-Saharan Africa\nThe Azuri model, called the Indigo Duo solar home system is a simple kit with a 2.5 Wp \nPV module and a 3,300 mAh battery, connected to two LED lights (60 lumens each), and \nthe Indigo controller (the black box). The battery and the controller are housed in the \nblack box with a keypad (see picture). \nThe black box allows power in the sockets only when the system has been recharged using \na valid code provided to the user. This code is obtained when the user makes a payment, \ntypically for a one-week or four-week duration. \nThe business model works through distribution channels as Azuri does not have any direct \nsales strategy. Hardware and services are sold to distribution partners, say in Sub Saharan \nAfrica. Distributors are trained in the \nAzuri system, and they are demarcated \nareas of coverage. The cloud based Azuri \ndatabase stores details of all distributors \nand consumers, providing each and every \nconsumer with a unique ID (like a serial \nnumber).\nFor the user, there are eighty instalment \npayments after purchase of his system. \nEach of the payments contributes \nsomething towards the cost of the \nsystem. After expiry of the installments, \nthe system becomes free at the hands of \nthe user.\n#5 ENABLERS AND ACTIONS FOR MARKET DEVELOPMENT- A STAGE GATE APPROACH \nDevelopment of RE markets is often a stage - wise process wherein each stage is the outcome \nof policy directions and actions facilitated by government, and the resultant responses from \nthe private sector and other engaged stakeholders. Each stage thus requires broad-based as \nwell as targeted enablers for various technologies and business models to develop and \nmature. The Stage-gate model as explained below, facilitates an understanding of these \nenablers. \n#5.1 Stage-Gate model for market development \u2013 look back to move ahead\nThe stage-gate model is technically understood as a management technique in which an \ninitiative or a project is divided into stages, separated by gates. At each gate, the approach \nis \u2018look back to move ahead\u2019. In other words, the continuation of the initiative is contingent \nupon certain conditions to be met, review to be done, risks to be assessed at each gate, and \nthen an informed decision to be taken to move ahead to the next stage. \nIn the current context, the RE market in Afghanistan would follow three (3) stages: market \nseeding to market creation and then to market transformation, with each stage being built \non certain enablers (technical, regulatory/ policy, financial/ economical and institutional \nor related to capacities) that are put in place. As mentioned earlier, there are some \noverarching enablers that are required for the entire RE sector per se, but there are also \nspecific and targeted actions that need to be undertaken for specific technologies and \nbusiness models to grow. This chapter \ndiscusses the Stage- Gate model as \napplicable to Afghanistan, followed by a \ndiscussion on overarching as well as \ntargeted enablers and actions for each \nstage of the market development. \nFigure 29 presents the Stage-Gate \nframework of the above-discussed \napproach. As shown in the graph, the Stage\u0002Gate figure juxtaposes capacity additions in \nrenewable energy over time, so as to \ndemonstrate the trajectory of growth of \nthe energy sector circa 2032.\n5.1.1 Market seding & Stage - Gate 1 (SG1)\nThe Stage- Gate 1 is the successful completion of the first stage representing seeding of the \nRE market. This stage is characterized by the following: \n\u2022 This stage builds upon existing experience in the country on renewable energy and proof \nof concept for some RE technologies that have not been tried at all or at the scale that \nthe Roadmap suggests. ;\n\u2022 The thematic focus remains on identifying tried-and-tested technologies, together with \nthe processes, in terms of policies and guidelines and initiating a few pilots to seed the \nmarkets.;\n\u2022 Increase in installed capacities for technologies identified as highly applicable in \nAfghanistan in the current context (as shown in Table 10 in chapter 3). This includes \nsolar PV, mini and micro hydro technologies, and wind power. ;\n\u2022 In terms of specific technology applications, the highest focus remains on utility scale \npower projects, whether installed as a power park or as IPPs. Other important \ncontributions are from mini-grids (solar as well as hydro) and stand-alone solar PV. ;\n\u2022 New technologies to be piloted include waste to energy, roof-top solar, stand-alone solar \nfor strategic applications such as telecom tower and pumping, solar thermal applications \nand domestic cooking using improved cookstoves and biogas. ;\n\u2022 This stage is supported by government and partner (donor) funds as the market is still \npremature and needs structural support. Details are discussed in chapter 6 on \u2018Costing \nand Financing of Roadmap\u2019;\n\u2022 The market creation stage represents demonstration of \u2018techno-commercial viability\u2019\nand confidence building of private sector. ;\n\u2022 The focus shifts to setting up more projects in order to create the markets. In this stage, \nvarious business models are implemented and customized to achieve success in the \nAfghan context.;\n\u2022 In addition to technologies that are initiated in SG1 and are now (expectedly) being \nimplemented at a commercial scale, SG2 introduces new technologies such as CSP, \nFloatovoltaics, CPV, Biomass power generation, and geothermal energy particularly for \nheating applications. ;\n\u2022 SG2 is still supported by grants and government support, but their share is expected to \nreduce, from almost 80% finance (as in SG1) to around 40%. This share is taken up by \npromoter\u2019s equity, while the grant component could be redistributed as viability gap \nfunding and other sources of low cost debt.;\n\u2022 This stage represents market maturity and expansion, led by private initiative.;\n\u2022 Stakeholders (mainly private sector, represented both by local and global) are fully \nfamiliar with the ground rules vis-\u00e0-vis RE markets in Afghanistan, and a number of \nenterprise models are operating to transform the sector to higher levels of growth.\n\u2022 Government inputs and support are strategic in nature, focusing on newer technologies, \nnewer policies and newer initiatives.;\n\u2022 In this stage, grants may still exist for a few sunrise applications, but overall forms a \nsmall share of the pool of funds (15%). Promoter contributions exceed 50% with own \nequity, market debt and low-cost debt.;\nAs discussed at the beginning of the chapter, the essence of the Stage-Gate developmental \nmodel is the effective presence of enablers and actions. Sections below discuss the key \nenablers and actions required for meeting the targets through each of the three stages. The \nstages contain certain provisos, which if realized could translate into additional power \ngeneration and eventual contribution to the RENP policy target of 5,000 MW by 2032.\n#5.2 Key enablers and actions \n#5.2.1 Policy readiness and programmatic support\nOne of the recurrent prerequisites discussed in the context of RE sector development is the \nneed for policies and regulatory direction from the government. Among the landmarks \nachieved, Renewable Energy Policy for the country has been finalized. Another vital \nregulatory instrument is the Feed in Tariff Policy. In addition, Energy Investment Policy and \nothers are also in the process of being approved.\nWhile these policies provide a legal and regulatory framework for managing the overall \nenergy and renewable energy domains, there is also a need for other specific enablers which \ninclude the following:\na. Programmatic guidelines (or Schemes) for promoting specific business \nmodels: National level programmatic guidelines for development of Solar (or \nWind) Power Parks and for Distribution Franchisees shall unlock the markets for \nSPPs and pave way for distribution franchisee or mini-utilities in the country. The \nguidelines should include as a minimum - the definition; framework and \nprocesses; institutional roles and responsibilities; permissions, clearances and \nstatutory requirements; power evacuation and financing mechanisms. \nb. Policy on mini-grids: A dedicated policy on mini-grids is required to kick-start \nthis segment in Afghanistan. The policy should expectedly include the definition \nand description; technical standards and guidelines for designing, operating and \nmaintaining the mini-grids; tariff methodologies; structure and roles for the \nenergy service company (RESCO); regulations and incentives; and involvement of \nlocal enterprises, communities in sustaining the mini-grids. \nc. Regulatory guidance on power distribution and grid integration for off-grid \nsystems: There is a need to provide guidelines for setting up of roof-top and off\u0002grid power projects in a manner that would allow safe and seamless integration \nwith the national grid when it reached these locations. \nd. Demarcation of areas for electrification through decentralised (localized) \ngeneration: Taking DABS\u2019 proposed network as the starting point, districts or \nzones may be identified where power may be generated and consumed locally. \nThese shall not only open the market for decentralised renewable energy \nprojects, but also allow DABS to identify its own priority areas. It would also \nprovide clear guidance for electrification efforts in Afghanistan.\ne. Greening of strategic sectors: Telecommunication, agricultural pumping, \ntransportation, food processing, buildings and construction, internal and border \nsecurity, etc. are some of the strategic sectors that require reliable electricity. \nA scheme for promoting the use of RE in these sectors would create demand and \nprovide the \u2018pull\u2019 for RETs in the country.\nf. Incentives for use of solar hot water systems: As a part of Afghanistan building \nenergy codes and regulations, use of solar hot water systems should be \nincentivized so that the dependence on electric or thermal heating systems for \nwater is reduced. Some of the incentives would be discounts in monthly or yearly \nelectricity bills, rebate on home loans, reduced property tax etc.\n#5.2.2 Technological and technical support\ng. Developing the RE resource atlas: While available RE resource maps that are \ndeveloped by MEW are useful to conduct pre-feasibilities of projects, \nimprovements such as demarcation of RE resources using time series data of key \nvariables such as GHI, DNI (for solar), wind speeds, flow rates for MHP and SHPs \nshall enhance the quality of the maps. The preparation of RE atlas is thus an \nimportant action that need to start as early as possible to facilitate project \ndevelopers in designing the projects in market creation stage. \nh. Testing and certification of systems and components: In order to ensure the \nquality and safety of RE systems and components, and to ensure the designed \nand expected performance, it is important to create a state-of-the-art national \nlevel testing and certification facility that could later be expanded at provincial \nlevels. Existing efforts in this direction taken by the Afghanistan National \nStandards Authority (ANSA) may be complemented. \ni. Technical training and education: In order to provide a constant stream of \neducated and skilled workforce to sustain this sector, it is important to \nmainstream the RE education and skill development as a part of national level \neducational and vocational training infrastructure. A specialist organisation may \nalso be set up, or existing institutions such as the Vocational Training Centre \n(VTC) strengthened, so as to meet this challenge in a systematic manner.\n#5.2.3 Institutions and institutional framework\nj. Independent regulatory agency: Role of the regulatory agency would be to \nintroduce and guide regulations on various subjects such as tariffs, power access \nand transmission, determination of a national \u2018grid code\u2019, issuance of licenses \nfor power generation and distribution operations. It can issue guidance on \ndemarcated zones for decentralised and off-grid power generation, facilitate \ndevelopment of solar power parks, open access and power purchase / sales and \nso on. Thus, the regulatory agency shall be a key enabler in structuring the \nelectricity sector and complement the efforts of the Ministry of Energy and \nWater.\nk. Specialized institutions or Special Purpose Vehicles: These shall be formed to \ncarry out activities specific to a sub-sector or project type. For instance, the \nSolar Power Park Developer (SPPD) may be entrusted with the task of setting up \nand managing solar PV parks. Similarly, there could be a dedicated entity \nmanaging the roof-top sector. These specialized bodies, set up under the aegis \nof the MEW can be given executive power, thereby according them ownership \nand responsibility.\nl. Rural electricity utility: The rural electricity utility may be given responsibilities \nfor generation, transmission and distribution exclusively in rural areas. In terms \nof ownership, the utility could be a public corporation or a government owned \ncompany. Given that most of rural Afghanistan is not connected to the national \ngrid, a dedicated rural utility shall provide greater focus on meeting the rural \npower shortage scenario.\nm. Dedicated financial institution: As the sector grows and enters the market \ncreation stage, it would require a dedicated institution to generate and manage 80\nfunds for the implementation of RE projects. The institution will be developed \nto manage local as well as international grants and lines of credit. This shall \ncreate a basket-fund approach, in which development partners and other \nagencies can pool in resources and enable the entity to offer a string of financial \nsolutions to suit various project types. The financial entity may empanel \nprospective project developers (private sector players, micro-finance \ncompanies, NGOs) who can avail of financial support through it.\nn. Coordination mechanism and an oversight: coordination between institutions \nresponsible for electricity generation, distribution and application is important \nfor realizing the potential of RE in Afghanistan. Therefore, an effective \ncoordination mechanism amongst these institutions is an important step to \nensure synchronized development of the sector.\no. Institutional capacities on project planning, managing, monitoring and \nreporting: RE sector will grow on the shoulders of strong and capable national \nlevel institutions. Building and strengthening of institutions is therefore a pre\u0002requisite for developing RE sector in Afghanistan. Specifically, capacities need \nto be strengthened across MEW, MRRD and other key ministries and provincial \ngovernments on technical, managerial, administrative and financing aspects of \nRE projects. This would be a continuous process, as there would be a need to \nkeep abreast with the latest developments in RE sector internationally and also \nto incorporate learnings from local as well as international experiences. \np. National level awareness generation: since the success of RE sector depends on \nits effective uptake by various sections of the society and communities, it is \ncritical to make them aware of and educate them about the use and benefits of \nRE systems. An all-encompassing and multi-stakeholder targeted national level \ncampaign on RE is expected to help catalyze the growth of the sector.\n#5.2.4 Access to finance\nOne of the key enablers for RE sector in Afghanistan is access to finance, which spans across \nall finance needs, viz. large, medium, small and micro. In this direction, the relative \nweakness in the Afghan domestic financial system implies that private resources are not \nreadily available for investment in the renewable energy sector. \nAs a result, the main sources of finance lie in the public domain. The RENP has rightly \nidentified the unlocking of private capital as a means to finance investments in the \nrenewable energy sector. Engagement of banking sector & investment finance can take \nplace at the following levels:\nq. Bank (Debt) Finance: Bank finance for large and medium scale projects in the \nrenewable energy sector shall in-turn mobilize both private and public capital. \nCurrently, most projects in this domain get supported by concessional donor \nfunds and government contributions. Currently Afghan banks are more focused \non retail operations, however donor or government guaranteed debt instruments \ncan leverage additional capital. These can be utilized to expedite \nimplementation of renewable energy projects, especially for solar power parks, \nlarger RE technology projects and setting up of power distribution franchisees.\nr. Microfinance: Primarily for micro scale projects at the user level, microfinance \nsupported renewable energy projects has had significant success in ecosystems\nsimilar to Afghanistan, across Asia and Africa. Similar potential exists here, with \nhigh levels of household energy demand for consumption as well as micro\u0002enterprise development.\ns. Working capital finance: In addition, working capital finance, which is currently \navailable from Afghan banks for large businesses and industrial groups, is a \npotential enabler for easing the capital constraints of the RE market.\n#5.2.5 Local manufacturing and enterprise development\nt. Enterprise development: In a rural economy, enterprises form the backbone, \nsupporting the economy with employment, trade and commerce. Enterprises also \nenable communities to adapt to climate-induced exigencies that lead to lower \nfarm incomes and consequently higher climate vulnerability. From an energy \nsecurity perspective, enterprises are a key enabler as they are able to utilise \nenergy for productive applications, thereby generating incomes to sustain both \nthe enterprise as well as the energy generation unit. \nThere is a role for social enterprise incubators, who provide various value-add \nservices such as sales and marketing tie-ups, advice on operating businesses and\nstart-up capital. In the Afghan context, the incubator landscape is dominated by \ndonors and CSOs, which provide inputs to enterprise development. However, \nthere is a need for strengthening enterprises as well as enterprise incubation \nservices. Several government agencies, especially MRRD and MAIL (Ministry of \nAgriculture, Irrigation and Livestock), in collaboration with development \npartners, have set up incubators to facilitate rural enterprise development.\nu. Support programme for local RE industry: since local industry is expected to \nprovide the back-bone of RE sector in Afghanistan, it is important to design and \nimplement a support programme for local manufacturers, system assemblers and \nothers by way of enhancing their capacities, providing networking opportunities \nwith international industry, access to technology and technical know-how, \nfinancial incentives, mentoring and incubation, involvement through regular \nconsultations for policies and overall RE sector\u2019s improvement etc.\nv. Private \u2013 Public \u2013 Partnerships or PPP: The PPP model works on the premise of \ngetting the best out of public and private sectors to work together for a common \ngoal. While the public sector brings socially responsive pro-poor approach to \nproject design, the private sector focuses on financial viability of the project. \nThe PPP model also helps in developing the confidence of the private sector \nthrough risk sharing mechanism. \nWith spatially distributed communities, PPP projects are especially an enabler in \nunlocking private capital for financing renewable energy projects in rural sector. \nThis model is particularly pertinent in mini-grid sector where DABS along with a \nlocal RESCO can work together to build, operate and maintain (or transfer) mini\u0002grids, and in the process, builds the capacities of local enterprises to undertake \nsuch projects in future.\nw. Fiscal and financial incentives for RE sector: while the sector will continue to \nbenefit from already available support and incentives for the private sector led \ninfrastructure projects, the RE sector would require customized fiscal and \nfinancial incentives particularly in terms of customs duty and import tax waivers.\n5.2.6 Risk management\nManagement of risks is a key enabler in providing the right environment for stakeholders \nengaged in the sustainable energy sector. Although risks and their mitigants could be varied, \nbroad risk classes are outlined below:\nx. Mitigating business risks: Business risks include delays in import and \ntransportation, absence of insurance or high insurance premium, lack or absence \nof skilled labor, risks of theft of plant and machinery (during transit, or during \nimplementation / operation) etc. These risks, most of which are present in \nAfghanistan, can be mitigated by policy interventions and / or improvement in \noverall business environment.\ny. Managing project risks: As distinct from business risks, project risks are intrinsic \nto the project location. These could include revenue risks arising from non\u0002payment of dues from consumers, cost overrun risks from delayed \nimplementation, safety risks from possible accidents etc. Some of these risks \noverlap with business risks as well. Better project design and management will \nhelp in mitigating these risks. \nz. Addressing security risks: Finally, the delicate security situation in the country \nposes a risk as well. While the success of telecommunication in Afghanistan has \nindicated that rural infrastructure may not always be threatened by the security \nsituation, the potential for disruption remains active. Direct mitigating measures \ninclude use of security, while more passive options could be to build trust capital \nwith local communities as a means to counter subversive forces. \nManagement of these risks reduces chances of project failure and are crucial for the success \nof the renewable energy sector in general.\nThe following table maps enablers along with the stage of implementation in terms of the \napplicable stage-gate when the enabler is expected to be introduced. \nEnablers as applied to relevant RE applications and business models are discussed in next \nsection.\n#5.3 Enablers for implementation of specific business models\nThis section breaks down some of the enablers outlined in the sections above, into enabling \nactivities specific to the context of business models and technologies discussed in this \nRoadmap. \n#5.3.1 Enablers for Solar Power Parks\n#5.3.2 Enablers for Distribution Franchisee\nIt is expected that Distribution Franchisee projects shall be implemented in urban and \nindustrial areas of Afghanistan, although a modified version could be equally applicable for \nRESCO projects. Success factors and visibility of DF projects shall lead to greater \nproliferation of DF projects.\n#5.3.3 Enablers for Roof-top solar\n#5.3.4 Enablers for mini-grid and RESCO business model\n#5.3.5 Enablers for microfinance supported stand-alone PV market\nAs discussed, the Stage-Gate framework of development is contingent upon the \nintroduction and implementation of enablers, both overarching and specific to business \nmodels. An important enabler for the overall RE future development is related to \navailability of funds and financing instruments which are discussed in the next chapter\nin details\n6 COSTING AND FINANCING OF ROADMAP\nThe purpose of this chapter is to outline the framework that can be used to estimate initial \ncosts for achieving Roadmap targets, and to outline mechanisms that can be used to reduce \nthe cost to the government and international development partners by incentivizing \ninvestment by the private sector.\nThe RE market in Afghanistan is in infancy and hence there is no clear \u2018market price\u2019 for RE \nin Afghanistan. Wide variations in costs exist even amongst similar RE system configurations. \nThis is a consequence of projects being grant funded by a wide variety of donors (with \ncorresponding variations in standards, overheads, and costs), a small and fragmented \nmarket, the lack of focus on commercial sustainability, and an emphasis on system \ncommissioning rather than on ongoing operations and maintenance.\nA framework is designed for evaluating potential costs required to reach the targets of \nStage- Gate I of this Roadmap. Costs for these RE technologies are estimated based on broad \ninternational benchmarks obtained from credible sources. The framework allows costs to be \ncalculated by technology (e.g. Solar PV) and market (e.g. utility scale). It then outlines a \nmechanism to put in place financial instruments appropriate to the market type (i.e. utility \nscale, mini-grids, etc.). \nThis framework is not technology specific, but does make note of the degree of maturity of \nthese technologies in Afghanistan. This degree of maturity can be used to evaluate useful \ninstruments for the current stage of the market and make efforts to put in place mechanisms \nthat will be useful at future stages. The framework is geared towards maximizing the role \nand investment of the private sector, and targeting donor / government subsidies to that \nend. Private-sector led growth is both in line with the RENP (and economic development \nefforts more generally), and is cost-effective, as international experience suggests that a \nrobust competitive private sector dominated market with effective regulation promotes the \ngreatest market growth and lowest prices. \nIn keeping with the overall structure of this Roadmap document, the goal is to move towards \na liberalized energy market. To date, there has been very limited investment by private \nsector RE developers or commercial financial institutions, although surveys conducted \nsuggest an interest and willingness provided risks are adequately addressed. The financing \nstrategy is to gradually reduce the proportion of public investment in favour of higher share \nof investment by the private sector in the forms of viability gap funding, debt, equity, and \nvarious hybrid financing and risk mitigation products.\nThe framework is built upon deploying the right financial mechanisms based upon business \nmodel or market type (e.g. utility scale projects), and the stage of market development \n(e.g. market creation). The financial mechanisms are selected based upon the likely barriers \nbeing faced to private sector led market growth at that stage and are organized into three \nbroad areas; subsidies and grants, risk reduction/ mitigation instruments, and climate \nchange related funds / mechanisms.\n#6.1 RE benchmark costs and global cost trends\nGlobally, RE prices have dropped consistently over the past few years, a trend that is\nexpected to continue for at least the next decade. Future costs for renewable energy will \ndepend on a variety of inter-related factors including technological advancement, market \nexpansion and regulatory action. However, the core premise is that costs will reduce as the 88\nmarket expands, which is supported by international experience. The following figure shows \nthe trends in utility scale solar PV auctions throughout the world. It is clearly visible that \nthe prices are going down at a rapid rate. \nIn fact, utility scale solar PV is even achieving parity with fossil fuel (coal) based systems in \nsome countries. As an illustrative example, the figure below shows how the tariffs bid by \ndevelopers (the price) has changed as the installed capacity for utility scale PV has increased \n(market expansion) in India :\nGlobal PV utility scale costs and wind power costs are expected to halve over the next\ndecade. Biomass and hydropower, as mature technologies, are not expected to fall too much \nin prices. However, based upon current technological trends and research, prices for the \ncore mini-grid system are predicted to drop by over 50% in the next twenty years.\nNew tenders (particularly in the Middle East) also reveal such low prices. While it remains \nto be seen if projects bid at these rates will be financially viable (and it should be noted \nthat complex financing and PPA structures can make this published cost difficult to \ncompare), these projects do point to the potential for cost savings given a mature market. \n#6.2 RE costs in Afghanistan\nTo establish the cost baseline in the absence of an established market in Afghanistan, costs \nfor reference systems were procured from local RE organizations. In the case of solar PV, \nthe AREU was asked to provide quotations for systems in each of the proposed markets (1 \nMW with no storage (utility scale market), 100 kW with some storage (mini-grid market), \nand 10 kW stand alone with battery backup (large household system market). The graph \nbelow shows unit costs (USD/ Watt) for solar PV systems of different configurations, as \nprovided by the AREU.\nSolar panel costs were broken out separately, while other costs were grouped within the \ncategories of other equipment, other costs, and government costs for sake of comparison\nas shown below. It should also be noted that land costs and security costs are not included \nas these are highly variable and site specific. \nOther equipment:\nInverters, batteries, PV panel stands, battery racks, grounding, cabling, \nsafety ropes, nuts, and bolts and other miscellaneous minor equipment \nrequired for plant construction;\nOther costs:\nEquipment transport to site, management and administration charges, site \nlabour charges, site design and civil works and other miscellaneous design and \nsite preparation costs.;\nGovernment costs:\nTaxes and permitting fees;\nIt appears that economies of scale are present in panel costs (as evidenced by lower panel \nunit costs as system sizes increase). However, quotations received indicate that the greater \nsystem complexity including additional charge controllers required for a mini-grid as \ncompared to a home system negate these economies of scale when overall costs are \nconsidered. In contrast, the lack of storage (battery costs are approximately 40% of the \nequipment cost for home systems and 30% for mini-grids) and simpler configurations \nrequired for a utility scale system result in overall unit costs below 50% as compared to \nhome systems and mini-grids.\nWhen compared to global and regional benchmarks, it was found that costs are higher in \nAfghanistan. Higher equipment costs are likely a reflection both of higher transportation \nand logistics costs as well as of a smaller market and the lack of intense competition for \nlarge utility-scale projects. The higher labour costs reflect the lack of skilled technical \nlabour available for large-scale installations, which can be partially addressed by training \nprograms.\nThe proportion of costs (as shown below) for utility-scale systems in India and Afghanistan \nis similar, even though the logistics, market, and tax regime in India are different to\nAfghanistan. It suggests that a reduction in taxes, other supportive policies and an expanded \nmarket has the potential to drive costs down across both equipment and labour costs.\nFollowing scenario/developments will lead to rapid cost reductions in future:\n\u2022 Rapid progress towards integration into international RE market enabling country to \nbenefit from regional economies of scale;\n\u2022 Rapid improvement in logistics costs due to improved infrastructure particularly \ntowards sites for large utility-scale projects;\n\u2022 Positive regulatory environment, established track record and significantly reduced \nAfghanistan risk premium;\n#6.3 Cost of achieving Stage-Gate I target\nThe global costs mentioned in previous section have provided a basis for estimating the costs \nper MW of generation capacity for the various proposed technologies in Afghanistan. The \nassessment is limited to the cost of constructing and commissioning RE equipment and does \nnot include costs for transmission/distribution grid infrastructure, materials/equipment \nreplacement and O&M costs. The assessment also does not consider the land and security \ncosts required. These costs vary markedly across the country, and in many deployments land \nand security will either be provided by the government, the community or owners\u2019 \nassociations (as in the case of industrial parks).\nStage- Gate I represent the phase when technology deployment is at a nascent stage and \nprojects are generally intended to confirm the sufficient availability of natural resource \n(e.g. wind availability at the site) or to demonstrate technical viability and refine standard \ndesigns through pilot projects. Private-sector led capital investment at this stage is often \nchallenging, and faces the barriers of a lack of confidence in the natural resource and (once \nthe resource potential is established) confidence in the techno-economic viability of the \nproject. \nThe table below provides an indication of what costs might be based upon international\nbenchmarks provided above to give an indication of the scale of investments required to \nreach the roadmap targets in Stage- Gate I. However, as it should be noted again that these \ncosts represent broad global averages rather than Afghanistan specific costs. Further, these \ncosts represent a wide range of sites, financing, and market conditions, and often consist \nof only \u2018core\u2019 costs (not including distribution, O&M, capacity building, etc.). Nevertheless, 93\napplying these broad benchmarks suggests that the overall capital costs to achieve the \nroadmap targets in Stage- Gate I will be around 500 million USD.\n#6.4 Financing of Roadmap\nThe sections above on costing outlined a framework to estimate the range of costs for \ndeploying RE technology/market combinations as per the Roadmap targets. This section\noutlines a framework to judge and put in place financing instruments appropriate to the \nmarket type (e.g. utility scale, mini-grid) and stage of expansion, but is not technology\u0002specific. It should also be noted that these financing mechanisms are only one aspect of a \nrobust private sector. This chapter does not discuss financing modalities for the broader \ninfrastructure for the energy sector that must be built (such as transmission infrastructure), \nnor does it discuss financing of improved logistics, security, etc. \n#6.5 Framework for financing \nThe framework for suitable financing actions is aligned with the broader Roadmap \nframework that approaches RE development in terms of technologies, markets and stages. \nAt each of these stages (market seeding, market creation, market expansion), the market \ntends to be dominated by particular project types (e.g. resource assessments and pilot \nprojects tend to occur during the market seeding stage). These activities, particularly when \nattempted by the private sector, face risks and barriers. Each of these barriers is targeted \nby financial mechanisms, which are organized into grants / subsidies and risk mitigation \nmechanisms. Funding for these mechanisms is the form of instruments (e.g. grants through \nthe newly-announced Citizens\u2019 Charter Program). This approach is outlined below:\n#6.6 Funding instruments and mechanisms \nIn this analysis, climate fund instruments are called out separately due to their particular \napplicability to renewable energy. Risks and barriers to RE development have been \npreviously discussed in the policy framework for RE development (the RENP) and are unique \nto a particular market and stage of development, and a brief definition of the types of \nfinancial mechanisms46 is provided below:\n#Subsidy/Grant:\nThese are monetary benefits given to private sector participants and \nconsumers so as to reduce the financial impact of commissioning and maintaining RE \nprojects. The purpose of these mechanisms is to recognize and address commercial issues \nthat can make a RE project unviable if the only funding available was from the private \nsector. These can include generation-based capital subsidies (where grants are provided to \nproject developers for commissioning plants), ongoing Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) or \nFeed-in-Tariff subsidies (where monies are provided based upon ongoing generation) or \nconcessional finance (where monies are used to provide a cheaper source of capital such as \nequity or debt to RE developers). \nThe payment of the grant or subsidy is linked wherever possible to outputs; a certain \ncapacity installed or energy generated over time. To date, the financing ecosystem for \nrenewable energy in Afghanistan has been almost completely dominated by grants. \nInstruments under this mechanism include design-build or design-build-operate contracts \nfinanced by international development agencies, grants for infrastructure such as under the \nNSP (and by the newly-launched Citizens\u2019 Charter Programs) and funding by NGOs. An \noverview of some of these types of grant/subsidy funding mechanisms is provided below:\n#Risk mitigating instruments:\nThese are insurance and risk mitigation mechanisms that are \nguaranteed by public (e.g. donor or government) monies but which are paid out not in the \nnormal course of commercial business, but during a specified non-business event. The \npurpose of these mechanisms is to recognize and address non-commercial risks that prevent \nprivate sector participants from investing. These mechanisms and events include resource \nrisk guarantees (paid out when exploratory or resource assessment investigations by the \nprivate sector fail to uncover sufficient natural resource potential such as geothermal basin \nheat capability); political / sovereign risks (e.g. political insurrection) and to serve as re\u0002insurance for commercial insurers. \nWhile risk mitigation financial mechanisms have not yet been used in the renewable energy \nindustry in Afghanistan, they are being attempted in areas such as natural-gas fired power \ngeneration. Risk mitigation instruments are usually provided by development banks such \nas the World Bank Group and the Asian Development Bank.\n#Climate funds:\nThese are financial mechanisms / monetary incentives specifically designed \nto increase the penetration of climate friendly technologies. Although in practice they can \ntake the form of a subsidy or risk mitigation mechanism, they are called out here separately \nas they are specific to RE development. There are a variety of climate funding opportunities \nthat serve different purposes and which are designed to be deployed at particular stages of \nmarket evolution. Pilot projects and programs have previously accessed climate funding, \nand larger integrated programs have applied for funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF).\n#6.7 Financing approaches for different stages of development\n#Stage 1: market seeding\nThis is when technology deployment is at a nascent stage and projects are generally \nintended to confirm the sufficient availability of natural resource (e.g wind availability at \nthe site) or to demonstrate technical viability and refine standard designs through pilot \nprojects. Private-sector led capital investment at this stage is often challenging, and faces \nthe barriers of a lack of confidence in the natural resource and (once the resource potential \nis established) confidence in the techno-economic viability of the project. \nThe type of direct grant funding that has been traditionally employed by development \npartners in Afghanistan is useful at this stage. Public grant money also has a role to play in \nhelping ensure that any results or lessons learned from resource assessments are shared as \nwell as helping to provide legitimacy (by assisting with certification and monitoring) for \nresource assessments. Certification and legitimacy of resource assessments and pilot \nproject results also help provide proof points that give confidence for the private sector to \nbegin investing in projects, and for commercial banks to provide financing.\nRather than a direct grant, a resource risk guarantee can be useful in instances where \nthere is the possibility of pursuing an integrated strategy with a project developer for \nresource assessment and an initial commercial project (e.g. the private developer agrees to \nperform the geothermal resource assessment at a site, and if successful, then develop the \nsite into a commercial project). A resource risk guarantee is structured such that if the \ninitial resource investigation proves to be unviable, the resource risk guarantee \ncompensates the developer for all or part of the cost of the resource investigation.\nWith regard to climate funds appropriate mechanisms at this stage are those that focus on \ntechnology transfer and can be mobilized quickly. The Climate Technology Centre and \nNetwork (CTCN) and Poznan Technology Transfer mechanisms are designed for this purpose.\n#Stage 2: market creation \nAt this point, natural resource availability and technical viability have been established, and \ntechnology application is no longer new to the country as a result of multiple pilot projects. \nThe focus at this stage is demonstrating that the designs and business models developed \nduring pilot projects of the Market Seeding stage can be scaled and replicated. Private \nsector entities at this stage start exhibiting interest in mechanisms apart from pure grant\u0002funded contracting (as is normally the case in the pilot projects of the previous phase). \nThe barriers faced to private-sector led growth revolve around longer-term viability such as \ncontinued O&M and cost recovery (initial technical and financial viability having been \nestablished) and the perception of risk regarding political climate and security. \nGrant / subsidy mechanisms chosen at this stage are selected to let the market decide the \nlevel of risk that private sector entrants are willing to bear. It is possible that subsidies will \nstill need to be offered to elicit private sector interest (especially in markets where \nelectricity tariffs are regulated) and will involve some combination of subsidies for capital \ninvestment and for ongoing operation. It is recommended that subsidies/grants be explicitly \nlinked to effective output; such as payment upon some defined capacity commissioned and \ncertified, or linked to per unit of continued energy production. The government has the \nopportunity to incentivize developers through mechanisms that forego revenue but increase \nthe market; tax holidays for profits and import duty exemptions for equipment. It is also \nrecommended that market mechanisms be used to determine the level of subsidy required \nthrough strategies such as auctions for the level of capital subsidy and PPA tariff. In the \nrecent 10 MW Kandahar solar project, an element of this model has already proved \nsuccessful; the PPA tariff that DABS would pay to the developer was decided based upon a \nreverse auction, while the capital subsidy was decided up-front. The next stage could be \nthe use of a reverse auction mechanism for both the capital subsidy and the PPA tariff.\nThe subsidy demanded by the market can be further reduced (and more private sector \nentrants enticed) through the use of risk mitigation products. Development organizations \nsuch as the World Bank, ADB, and OPIC provide these instruments, with variations for \nrequired eligibility (OPIC\u2019s mechanisms are in place to aid US businesses). These \ninstruments provide a guarantee for specified recompense in the event of a defined political \nevent or in the event that the government utility cannot make good on its commitments. \nTo ensure that the government also has protection, the contract terms of the IPP can specify \nthat the asset will pass to DABS in the event of independently-assessed non-performance.\nClimate funds at this stage of market evolution should be targeted towards programs rather \nthan individual projects. Larger funding packages such as those available from the GCF can \nbuild upon the proof points and lessons from the pilot programs commissioned during the \nmarket seeding stage to propose programmatic interventions. Conceivably, the results from \none climate-funded initiative can be used to apply for funding from another source; using a \nCTCN intervention for initial technology transfer and assistance, Global Environment Facility \n(GEF) or Climate Investment Funds (CIF) funds to build upon CTCN, and using these results \nto form the basis for a GCF proposal.\n#Stage 3: market expansion\nAt this stage, the market has been proven and viable combinations of technical designs and \nbusiness models are in place. The focus at this stage is to select financial structures to \nreduce the cost deploying systems in the commercial market. Grant / subsidy mechanisms \nare selected to assure demand, either through standardized FITs (again auctioned where \npossible) and access to concessional finance. In mature markets, government mechanisms \nare formed (such as IREDA in India) that allow concessional finance funds (from government \nfunds and institutions such as the ADB, World Bank and KfW) to be pooled and accessed by \nproject developers. In the case of Afghanistan, it will also be necessary to align these \ninstruments with Islamic Finance principles where required. With regard to risk mitigation, \nit is anticipated that in a mature market, a project developer will be able to access \nconventional sources of project insurance; and should an Afghanistan risk premium persist, \nre-insurance sponsored by multilateral agencies can reduce this premium. Climate funding \n(if available) is past the pilot, scale-up and market creation mechanisms and takes the form \nof active trading of carbon credits.\nThe framework as applied to the three roadmap market types (utility scale, mini-grid and \nstand-alone) is presented below, along with an assessment of the current maturity of \ntechnologies in each of these markets.\n#6.7.1 Financing framework applie to the Utility Scale market segment\n\u201cUtility Scale\u201d systems are typically characterized by larger projects that feed to the grid \nand sell bulk power, typically on a per unit (KWh) basis. During the market seeding stage, \nprivate sector developers face the risk of unknown natural resource potential at the site \n(which in turn can affect generation and revenue) as well as technical risks including the \nability to connect and inject power into the grid. At this stage, grant funding is useful to \nhelp locate suitable sites with natural resource potential and required infrastructure, and \nfund resource assessments, as well as for studies that demonstrate that generated power \ncan be evacuated by the grid. \nTo establish a track record of successful operation in areas of perceived increased risk, \ninitial projects in the country are likely to be grant funded. Since the electricity sale is \nusually to the utility, capacity building and technical assistance to train utility personnel in \neffectively managing the introduction of private sector power into the grid may also be \nuseful. As mentioned, in some cases (such as geothermal development), private sector \nparticipants may be willing to fund resource assessments as part of an integrated strategy \nthat leads to development if they are compensated in the event of the resource not being \nsufficient for commercial development. \nDuring the market creation stage, initial technical viability has been established and the \nfocus is on sustaining operations and revenue. In many instances, the cost of generating \npower is higher than that of other sources of grid supply (such as imported power from \nCentral Asia) and the regulated prevailing user tariff. Public monies will then be required \nto fill this \u2018viability gap\u2019 between the unit cost of generating renewable energy for the \ndeveloper and a per-unit revenue (tariff) realized by the utility. To reduce the overhead \ncosts of development and limit the developers\u2019 risk to the extent possible to technical \ngeneration of power, public monies are also useful to develop \u2018Renewable Energy Parks\u2019 \nwherein suitable site selection, ancillary infrastructure and security are arranged for by the \ngovernment. \nTechnical assistance to the government to effectively manage private sector participants \n(such as the structuring of contracts and tariff mechanisms) is also useful to safeguard the \ninterests of the government and consumers. Since the electricity is sold to one customer \n(the utility), the risks a private sector investor faces include default or non-payment on the \npart of the utility/government. As mentioned previously, instruments exist to insure the \ndeveloper against non-payment by the government or defined political risks.\nDuring the market expansion stage, the focus is on expanding the variety and scope of \nfinance available to private sector developers as well as to ensure continued demand for \nrenewable energy. A model that has proved successful in the region is for the government \nto set up a pooled finance mechanism for renewable energy development that is structured \nto accept concessional finance from development agencies and in turn lend (after \nappropriate due diligence) to project developers at favourable rates. In some cases, this \nfinance can take the form of an equity stake rather than debt. \nThe risk of insufficient demand can be reduced by transparent policies by the government \nto commit to renewable energy targets through mechanisms such as renewable purchase 99\nobligations, which compel government agencies (and in some cases large industrial and \ncommercial consumers) to source a certain percentage of their power from renewable \nsources. With regard to risk mitigation, the risk guarantee instruments that insure against \npolitical risk or non-performance by the utility can continue to be useful, as can \ninternational development agencies facilitating access to commercial insurance.\n#6.7.2. Financing framework applied to the Mini-grid market segment\nThe mini-grid market shares some similarities with the utility scale market (such as the \nproject type) but also has several important differences. For one, the barriers to successful \ncommercial operation rely on effective revenue collection and buy-in from a group of (often \nrural) consumers, rather than bulk sales to the grid. Systems are smaller and unless methods \nof aggregating assets into a portfolio are implemented and partnerships with local banks \nformed, the small scale of financing requirements often makes the cost of due diligence and \noversight problematic for multilateral development agencies and larger commercial banks. \nThe distributed / rural nature of many operations also presents challenges in terms of \ndirecting financing appropriately towards system sustainability. Finally, site selection must \nbe coordinated with grid expansion plans so that systems do not become unviable due to \ncompetition from cheaper grid power. \nDuring the market seeding stage, grant funding is useful for site-specific resource \nassessments, technology transfer and technical assistance, and capacity building both \namongst the mini-grid operators and the local community. The emphasis at this point is to \nuse public monies to refine the business model, select appropriate technology and to \ndevelop the knowledge and training tools for both producers and consumers of energy. \nDuring the market creation stage, lessons from these individual pilot projects are expanded \ninto programs. Grant / subsidy funds are directed towards funding the non-core aspects of 100\nsuccessful mini-grid operation such as knowledge platforms (for both consumers and \nproviders), equipment standards certification, and providing technical assistance and \ntechnology transfer support. It may be likely that subsidization of minigrids will be required \nto ensure financial viability for the operators, especially if tariffs are regulated and set to \ncompete with grid power. \nEvidence from previous systems suggest that longer-term maintenance and sustainability of \nsystems is an issue. For this reason, it is also prudent to ensure that backstop operation and \nfinance capability exists (supported by public monies) so that if a mini-grid operator cannot \ncarry out their functions, alternatives can be put in place to prevent the loss of the asset \nand faith of the user base. The market creation stage is also when a tighter integration \nbetween the larger government and development banks and rural banks becomes useful to \nhelp with the issue of aggregation mentioned previously and to ensure financing is available \nfor local mini-grid operators in a manner that is aligned with acceptable business practices \n(e.g. Islamic Finance).\nDuring the market expansion stage, after the technical and financial viability and \nsustainability of mini-grid systems has been prove, the focus is on ensuring adequate finance \nfor scale-up and demand for services. International experience suggests that this finance is \nbest conducted by local banks, who are in turn able to access concessional finance provided \nby public monies. Finance for technology transfer and technical assistance will still be \nrequired, but directed towards assistance in managing a portfolio of projects rather than \nindividual sites. \nAs the market expands, private sector developers will wish to secure insurance to guard \nagainst expropriation of assets by the government, loss of demand should the grid be \nexpanded to the area and political and security risks. As in the case of utility scale systems, \nexisting risk mitigation mechanisms such as guarantees and insurance can be deployed to \nallay private sector concerns.\nWhile the diagram and discussion below focus on financing mechanisms, these \nconsiderations are intrinsically linked to site and business model selection, discussed in \ngreater detail in chapters 3 and 4. Viability depends also on a supportive and transparent \nregulatory environment and protection of the rights of producers and consumers.\n#6.7.3 Financing framework applied to the Stand-Alone market segment\nThe challenges to private sector participation in the stand-alone market are similar to those \nfaced in the mini-grid (e.g sustainability of rural service delivery) but are nuanced by the \nneed for operations and maintenance over a wider group of consumers, the need for \nindividual consumers to mobilize the up-front capital for such systems, user confidence in \ninitial technical quality of systems, and ensuring that private sector participation is not \n\u2018crowded out\u2019 by purely grant funded external systems that are deployed in the same service \narea of coverage. International experience suggests that a viable stand-alone ecosystem \ncan be enhanced by a tight integration between technology providers, microfinance / \ncommercial finance institutions, and government / multilateral development agencies.\nDuring the market seeding stage, the focus is on developing standardized designs and \nbusiness models that can be deployed commercially. Many of the uses of grant funding in \nthe mini-grid market have applicability here; technology transfer, community engagement \nand demand assessment; feasibility studies; certification and measurements of benefits, \nand capacity building both for the suppliers and consumers of systems.\nDuring the market creation stage, integration between government / international \ndevelopment partners, commercial banks and technology providers has proved useful in \nother regions. This requires public funds to fund an organization to certify equipment and \nvendors; extend concessional finance for microfinance / banking institutions that in turn \nperform due diligence and extend credit (compliant with Islamic Finance) towards the \npurchase of certified equipment to users, and, where required, subsidize systems such that \nthey are affordable. Although stand-alone PV systems have been deployed in Afghanistan, \nevidence suggests that this lack of integration between technology and finance has \nprevented sustainable operation of many systems.\nDuring the market expansion stage, the involvement of the local banks is expanded to \nextending credit to systems providers so that they can expand operations, while continuing \ncredit facilities to consumers to purchase and maintain their systems. As in the case of \nmini-grids, this requires capacity building and concessional funding to commercial banks so \nthey have the tools to perform commercial due diligence on these systems providers and \nextend credit in a manner compliant with Islamic Finance principles (where required). \nPublic and grant funding also has a part to play in building awareness of the benefits and on \nproper use of the systems, and funding subsidies to ensure used equipment such as batteries \nare disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. \nRisk mitigation mechanisms typically do not come into play in the stand alone market due \nto the lower capital investment and distributed assets. However, should sufficiently large \nprivate sector players be evidenced in the market who seek international commercial \nfunding or insurance but require political risk / expropriation guarantees, risk mitigation \nmechanisms might be useful at that later stage of market development.\n#6.8 Conclusion- from dependent to self-reliance \nThe focus of the above discussed financing strategy is to incentivize private sector \nparticipation and investment. It is geared towards using government /donor monies to assist \nthe transition from a purely donor grant-driven reality to a vibrant competitive sector \ndominated by private sector led growth. International experience suggests that as the \nmarket expands and greater penetration of RE development is apparent, the relative \ncontribution of direct subsidies will decrease in place of risk mitigation mechanisms and \nconcessional finance. Following figures summarize the overall financial framework and a \npossible financial landscape covering all stages of RE sector development towards self\u0002reliance.\n#7 IMPLEMENTATION OF ROADMAP \nThe strategic rationale, methodology, project prioritization, technical considerations and \nfinancial strategies for achieving a step change in renewable energy deployment have been \nthe focus of this work. The above is proposed to be achieved through the roadmapping\nexercise by which a roadmap is created, implemented, monitored and updated as \nnecessary47. The Renewable Energy Roadmap -RER2032- an output of this work, is a high \nlevel strategic plan that sets the pathways to achieve the intended objectives of RE sector \ndevelopment in Afghanistan. The RER2032 has set milestones, outlined tasks and prioritised \nactions. \nThe next logical step is to implement the Roadmap by carrying out activities and initiatives \nthat address Roadmap tasks and priorities and monitoring their progress with the help of a \ntracking system. Accordingly, the 4Ps - Proponents, Projects and People- are considered at \nthe core of the Roadmap implementation plan. These are briefly discussed here. \n#7.1 Principles\nThe implementation of the Roadmap is based on four guiding principles: \na) Empowered and dedicated institution(s) - to oversee the implementation of \nthe Roadmap in a time bound and coordinated manner\nb) Participatory and collaborative approach- among various ministries, \ndepartments, donors, public institutions, private sector and communities to \nwork towards the common goals of achieving energy security and energy access \nby deploying renewable energy resources in Afghanistan\nc) Optimisation of existing and raising new financial resources- through a mix \nof donor funds, national funds and private finances with a focus on private\u0002sector led growth, and corresponding use of public monies to incentivize private \nsector participation.\nd) State-of-the-art global practices and techniques- customised to the local \nconditions and adopted effectively across all departmental functions and \nprojects\n#7.2 Proponents\nProponents are a set of state-led institutions spanning across financing and implementation \nspace that are needed to realize the intents of the Roadmap. It is critical that these \ninstitutions work in close collaboration with legislative and regulatory authorities to ensure \nthat renewable energy development is within a transparent legal framework. At the project \nlevel these institutions shall work closely with private sector players, thereby effectively \nbridging the gap between policy and practice. Finally, these public institutions shall also be \nable to work with development partners, donors and civil society organisations and thus be \nable to grow independently in future. Following three institutions are relevant for the \ngrowth of RE sector in Afghanistan:\nSetting up key institutions\nRenewables energy project development organisation\n\u2022 a for-profit public-private partnership organization \nfocused on utility-scale generation;\n\u2022 set up along the lines of AISA with overlapping \nfunctions to DABS;\n\u2022 to catalyse and foster growth of RET (solar and wind) \nbased power parks, and IPPs in collaboration with \nprivate sector;\n\u2022 would act as a single-window clearance for future IPPs;\nRural electrification agency \n\u2022 Promote rural electrification projects, specifically \nmini-grids through site selection, land acquisition, \naccess to finance, and regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 set up along the lines of DABS, but would set up \ngeneration and distribution of electricity in rural areas \nonly;\n\u2022 shall support local enterprises as RESCO as distribution \nfranchisees of DABS ;\n\u2022 serve to minimize risk to private sector\u2019s engagement \nin rural electrification;\n\u2022 shall work in close collaboration with ministries and \ndepartments serving rural population and requiring \nenergy services;\nFinancing institution for clean energy sector\n\u2022 a dedicated and empowered institution to finance \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency projects;\n\u2022 facilitating a basket-fund approach;\n\u2022 ensuring ring-fencing of funds for clean energy sector;\n\u2022 shall provide debt and equity to project promoters and \ndevelopers;\n\u2022 can also extend financial support by way of conditional \ngrants and last-stage equity that can provide viability\u0002gap financing;\n\u2022 be able to raise funds through internal as well as \nexternal markets;\nThe above institutions are governed and guided by the government Ministries which \nare primarily policy and law-making authorities. There are good examples from the \nregion that have served the purposes as described above. Some of these are \nInfrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL), Bangladesh; Indian Renewable \nEnergy Development Agency (IREDA), India; Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), \nIndia; and Alternate Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC), Nepal. \n#7.3 Projects \nTo meet the targets of the RENP, it is imperative to find success on the ground with \nprojects that are implemented in the \u2018first stage\u2019 of the Roadmap. The second focus \narea shall therefore be the development of strategically important and trendsetting \nprojects in addition to priority sectors outlined in Roadmap.\n1 Solar power park \nDe-risking deployment of utility-scale wind and solar projects \nby Identifying suitable sites, providing infrastructure for \nevacuation and security, and streamlining regulatory \nclearance. SPPs may be set up by DABS as the SPPD, and \neventually owned by private sector partners ;\n2 Mini-grids with RESCO model\nA cluster of mini-grid projects to be developed and bid out \neither individually or collectively following the RESCO \nbusiness model;\n4 Solar hot water systems for institutions\nAs an effective demand-side-management strategy to reduce \nelectricity generation requirements, while offering potential \nfor economic development through local manufacture, SHWS \nto be promoted in a programmatic mode;\n5 Kabul roof-top solar \nFollowing the maturity and proven viability of this market \nglobally, Kabul roof-top solar pilot project will seed this \nmarket for Afghanistan;\n6 RE atlas \nA national-level initiative that could build upon the RE \ndatabase and provide both a national strategic overview of RE \ndeployment and link to project-level monitoring; thus,\nproviding insights on new development opportunities and \noverall RE roadmap progress.;\n7 Pilot scale Geothermal\nIn line with the 55 MW Roadmap target, and recognizing the \nneed for impetus in this sector, geothermal resource \nassessment linked where viable to pilot geothermal projects \n(either direct heat or electricity) to catalyze activity;\n8 Pilot scale REEEP project\nAlthough not directly identified in Roadmap, this pilot scale \nproject to integrate RE with energy efficiency measures in \nthe commercial and industrial sector shall improve the \nviability and acceptance of RETs;\n9 Daikundi Mini-grid\nMini-grids being strategically important for Afghanistan, this \nproject will help in standardizing mini-grid designs and \nbusiness models;\n10 Hisar-e-Shahi industrial park solar project\nStrategically important project for industrial development \nthat forms the backbone of Afghan economy;\n#7.4 People \nThe intent of the RE sector development in Afghanistan is its people who need energy \nfor their well-being, livelihoods and development. The implementation of the \nRoadmap will also be shouldered by people who will perform technical, managerial, \nfinancial, administrative and other functions. The Roadmap therefore needs to be \ninclusive of people\u2019s expectations and involvement for whom it will be implemented; \nwhile at the same time be owned by people who will implement it. \nAwareness and skilling are two important people centric attributes that the Roadmap \nwill focus on for it implementation effectively. A national level initiative to raise the \nawareness levels of multi-stakeholders at multiple-levels will support the development \nof the RE sector, while short-term and long-term skill enhancement initiatives will \nmake it impactful. Vocational training programs focusing on RE system design, \ninstallation and maintenance along with university level programmes targeting energy \nsector planners and managers will be required to both ensure sufficient local capacity \nexists to develop and maintain RE infrastructure while capitalizing on RE as an \nopportunity for employment generation.\nAs illustrated below, detailing of the implementation plan along with its \nmonitoring and verification plan, are the next logical steps to move towards \nrealizing the set objectives of the RE development in Afghanistan. The expected \nimpacts, upon the successful implementation of the Roadmap are elaborated in \nthe next and the final chapter.\n#8 IMPACTS OF THE ROADMAP\nThe Roadmap facilitates the transformation of RE sector in Afghanistan from a \u2018current \nproject\u2019 centric thinking and approach to a programmatic or an ecosystem approach that \nencompasses technologies, markets, institutions, finances and other enablers. These \necosystem elements synergise to achieve the objectives of the Roadmap which are energy \nsecurity, energy access and socio-economic growth as listed in chapter 1 of this document. \nMoreover, the Roadmap has Broader Impacts that go beyond the said objectives.\n#8.1 Employment generation and livelihood creation\nEmployment in the renewable energy sector has been growing rapidly at the global level. In \n2015, the number of direct and indirect employees in the sector increased by 5%, to 8.1\nmillion supporting a total of 1095 GW. Many of these jobs are in the solar PV sector, and \ntheir share in the total is increasing every year. Accounting for large scale hydropower \nprojects adds a further 1.3 million to the 8.1 million. \nAccording to Wei et al., upstream RE sector creates 10 jobs per MW related to \nconstruction, operation and maintenance of projects; with solar creating nearly 15 \njobs/MW, and wind/hydro producing 6 job/MW capacity. Thus, the addition of 5000 MW RE \ncapacity is likely to support 50,000 jobs in Afghanistan.\nFurther, RE projects will also create livelihood opportunities in the downstream sector. \nAbout 70% of Afghan population is not served by the grid. The bulk of the population resides \nin rural areas. The deployment of RE mini-grids and other stand-alone projects in rural areas \nwith unmet demands for electricity and thermal energy can significantly improve the rural \neconomy, contributing to sustainable livelihoods through affordable agriculture, farm based \nand off-farm enterprises. These would in turn imply more employment, induced by the \nsetting up of the electricity infrastructure. For instance, a rural mini-grid of 1 MW could \npositively impact around 1,000 households and create or sustain 50 \u2013 60 livelihoods, \nincluding direct jobs generated (such as new opportunities as maintenance engineers for \nthe electricity setup). This does not include indirect benefits accrued from better access, \nsuch as better healthcare and education facilities, which shall attract new jobs as well.\nThus, there are far-reaching and tangible induced impacts that can be derived through \nprovision of reliable and competitively priced energy services. \n#8.2 Infrastructure development and enterprise development \nApart from benefits related to livelihood creation and employment, RE projects provide a \nboost to local economy by setting up new infrastructure and strengthening the existing ones. \nSpecifically, solar and wind power parks and other utility scale projects necessitate building \nof roads and facilitate setting up of water supply and other facilities. Enhanced energy \naccess through RE projects facilitates movement of industries to the otherwise virgin \nlocations as well as in the creation of new cottage industries, that are well served by \nelectricity.\nImproved energy infrastructure would also have a positive effect on larger industries in \nterms of their competitiveness and their exports. Afghanistan Chambers of Commerce in \ntheir Business Monitor indicated energy shortage as the major bottleneck (88%) in the \ndevelopment of industries. Industrial parks such as the ones in Hisar-e-Shahi would also \nbenefit greatly from reliable electricity supply, as having such a source would help them \nlower their overhead costs and hence create goods at a lower price. Finally, energy access \nwould catalyse setting up Rural Economic Zones \u2013 or rural business hubs including a market \nfor agri produce and inputs, repair and maintenance services and farm based enterprises \nsuch as processing plants and units.\nOn the social side, creation and operation of hospitals and schools are strongly dependent \nupon provision of electricity and thermal energy. Not surprisingly, best facilities for health \nand education in Afghanistan are to be found in the cities. Improvements in the energy \nsupply would help the urban as well as rural hospitals, schools and other community \ninstitutions invest in state-of-the-art equipment, and hence improve their overall services.\nIn terms of local economies, some of the impacts are as follows:\n\u2022 Agriculture: Though the most important employment sector is agriculture and \nlivestock where 39% Afghan population is employed, the productivity in the agriculture \nsector is low, with agriculture contributing just over 25% of GDP. Improved electricity \naccess would impact the farming structure, cropping patterns and behaviour, due to \nbetter irrigation. This would lead to better farm incomes, and better agricultural \nservices;\n\u2022 Financial services, especially microfinances, could be developed more easily. They \nwould be both a giver and a recipient of the benefits provided by energy access. Over \ntime, this could also stretch to core banking services such as local co-operatives;\n\u2022 Labour markets: The employment by sector and gender would also improve with \nexpansion in the farming and services sectors.;\n#8.3 Local manufacturing and supply chain creation\nSetting up RE projects would require local manufacturing of auxiliary as well as main \ncomponents and equipment in Afghanistan. Focusing on local manufacturing would help \nimprove the upstream and downstream supply chains develop in capacities and capabilities \nas well. The elements of local manufacturing and supply chain would not only limit to \nfabrication, assembly and system integration, but would also extend to transportation, \nwarehousing, engineering, procurement and construction activities. RE supply chain, once \ncreated, will benefit other sectors as well. \n#8.4 Co-ordinated planning and budgeting across various government \ndepartments\nOne of the re-requisites for implementing the Roadmap, is to inculcate a practice of \ncoordinated planning and budgeting of resources across various departments within the MEW \nand also with other Ministries. The mechanism of \u2018basket fund\u2019 would trigger this practice \nwhich will have far-reaching impacts in terms of optimum utilisation and effective \ndeployment of resources, for efficient gains to the overall economy of Afghanistan. \n#8.5 Co-benefits of climate change mitigation and resilience/ adaptation\nAfghanistan is a high-risk profile country according to the National Risk and Vulnerability \nAssessment (NRVA 2012). The Global Adaptation Index 2012, ranks it as the most vulnerable \nin country in the world, taking into account the country\u2019s exposure, sensitivity and ability \nto cope with climate related hazards, worsened by the socio-political conflicts and security. \nCoping with the impacts of climate change is a major challenge for development in \nAfghanistan given that its negative effects are likely to be most severely felt by the poor \nand marginalized due to their high dependence on subsistence agriculture and limited \ncapacity to cope with the impacts of climate variability and extremes. \nThe access to reliable and cost-effective energy will strengthen community-level coping\nstrategies and improve income, thereby increasing their resilience to climate change \nimpacts i.e. adaptation related benefits. Besides, the deployment of RE as per the Roadmap, \nwill reduce the dependence of communities on conventional fuels such as kerosene, diesel \nand biomass, contributing to mitigation elated benefits as well. \n#8.6 Sustainable development through leap-frogging\nAfghanistan currently has one of the lowest per-capita carbon emissions in the world. \nHowever, in order to develop itself into a successful economy, its energy use would have to \nincrease greatly. This will in-turn increase its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. By \ndeveloping its RE potential, Afghanistan is in a unique position where it can leapfrog over \ncarbon intensive energy sources like coal and oil, while at the same time following \nsustainable development pathways. \n#8.7 Cross-border trade and energy security\nAfghanistan gets more than 60% of its power requirements via imports. It also faces issues \nfrom grid snaps in its neighbouring countries, causing blackouts in cities like Kabul. As per\nthe Roadmap, Afghanistan\u2019s power generation capacity from domestic RE resources would \nreach 850 MW by the end of Stage 1, which would potentially replace around 40% of imports\nat the current levels, avoiding drain of foreign exchange that is required to finance energy \nimports. Focussing on renewables for domestic power generation, would ensure power \ngeneration and grid stability for its current and future energy needs, and would thus help \nAfghanistan achieve energy security. \nThe decreasing prices of renewables and their increased generation could be an opportunity \nfor Afghanistan to be a net energy supplier in the long term. In the short term, it could also \nact as a conduit transporting energy from Central Asian and West Asian economies \n(Tajikistan and Turkmenistan) to the energy starved South Asian countries \n(India/Pakistan/Nepal), while using its own generated energy within the country. \n#8.8 Knowledge creation and sharing through regional platforms\nRoadmap has introduced knowledge tools for developing projects, customising business \nmodels, benchmarking for RE costs, stage-gate framework for sector development etc. \nThese knowledge tools, geared towards planning for RE sector will be useful for other \ncountries in the region and Afghanistan can use regional platforms such as ECO and SAARC \nto share this knowledge. Besides, the valuable experience to be generated through \nimplementing different types of RE projects for various applications would create a body of \nknowledge that can also be shared with other countries in the region. \n#8.9 Potential to explore climate and sustainable development funds \nThe development of RE sector as envisaged in the Roadmap, will be aligned to the global \nagenda of climate change and sustainable development. Afghanistan will thus be able to \nexplore global resources and funds that are available for these sectors i.e. Green Climate \nFunds (GCF), Global Environment Facility (GEF), Scaling up Renewable Energy Programme \n(SREP) among others. Some of these funds are already made available to Afghanistan. \nHowever, their portfolio can be expanded to support the RE and related sectors. \n#8.10 Membership of IRENA, ISA and other organisations\nRenewable Energy Roadmap is a strong endorsement of the GoIRA for supporting this sector. \nThe introduction/ presence of an enabling ecosystem will further showcase the commitment \nat all levels to promote this sector. These actions will facilitate Afghanistan to become \nmember of international organisation such as International Renewable Energy Agency \n(IRENA) and International Solar Alliance (ISA). These memberships will further support the \ndevelopment of RE sector through tangible well as non-tangible instruments such as \ndemonstration projects, feasibilities studies, mapping of resources, monitoring and \nevaluation studies, knowledge exchange etc. \n#8.11 Advancement of SE4All and SDGs agenda\nAfghanistan, despite its internal challenges related to poverty, security etc., will adopt the \nglobal agenda towards sustainable energy for all and sustainable development goals through \nthe implementation of the Roadmap. This will catalyse a progressive thinking and approach \nto development, impacting not only the internal well-being but also propagating an \nenterprising image of Afghans. "}
