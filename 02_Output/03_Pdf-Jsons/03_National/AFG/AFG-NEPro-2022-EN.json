The bar chart shows the proportion of a country's land \narea in each of these classes and the global distribution of land area \nacross the classes (for comparison).\nOnshore wind: Potential wind power density (W/m2) is shown in the \nseven classes used by NREL, measured at a height of 100m. The bar chart \nshows the distribution of the country's land area in each of these classes \ncompared to the global distribution of wind resources. Areas in the third \nclass or above are considered to be a good wind resource.\nBiomass: Net primary production (NPP) is the amount of carbon fixed by \nplants and accumulated as biomass each year. It is a basic measure of \nbiomass productivity. The chart shows the average NPP in the country \n(tC/ha/yr), compared to the global average NPP of 3-4 tonnes of carbon \n= Global average of 3-4 tC/ha/yr\nIRENA Headquarters\nMasdar City\nP.O. Box 236, Abu Dhabi\nUnited Arab Emirates\nwww.irena.org\nSources: IRENA statistics, plus data from the following sources: UN SDG Database \n(original sources: WHO; World Bank; IEA; IRENA; and UNSD); UN World Population \nProspects; UNSD Energy Balances; UN COMTRADE; World Bank World Development \nIndicators; EDGAR; REN21 Global Status Report; IEA-IRENA Joint Policies and \nMeasures Database; IRENA Global Atlas; and World Bank Global Solar Atlas and Global \nWind Atlas.\nAdditional notes: Capacity per capita and public investments SDGs only apply to \ndeveloping areas. Energy self-sufficiency has been defined as total primary energy \nproduction divided by total primary energy supply. Energy trade includes all \ncommodities in Chapter 27 of the Harmonised System (HS). Capacity utilisation is \ncalculated as annual generation divided by year-end capacity x 8,760h/year. Avoided \nemissions from renewable power is calculated as renewable generation divided by \nfossil fuel generation multiplied by reported emissions from the power sector. This \nassumes that, if renewable power did not exist, fossil fuels would be used in its place \nto generate the same amount of power and using the same mix of fossil fuels. In \ncountries and years where no fossil fuel generation occurs, an average fossil fuel \nemission factor has been used to calculate the avoided emissions.\nThese profiles have been produced to provide an overview of developments in \nrenewable energy in different countries and areas.
