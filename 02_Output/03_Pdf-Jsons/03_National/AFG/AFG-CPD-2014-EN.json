The Afghanistan \u2018Transformation Decade\u2019 begins in 2015. With presidential \nelections in 2014, the withdrawal of international troops, and the closure of \nprovincial reconstruction teams, Afghanistan continues its journey towards self\u0002reliance. The coming years will be marked by the full sovereignty of Afghanistan\nover its political, security and development processes. The international community \nand the United Nations will continue to support Afghanistan, as exemplified in the \nTokyo Mutual Accountability Framework and the Chicago commitments on \ndevelopment and security. As Afghanistan enters its Transformation Decade, UNDP \nshould also transition to meet emerging priorities and operational challenges, guided \nby the United Nations Development Assistance Framework and the new strategic \nplan, 2014-2017.\n2. Considerable development gains have been made since 2001, despite the \ncontinued insurgency in parts of the country \u2014 a conflict that led to close to 9,000 \ncivilian casualties in 2013. Presidential elections were held in 2004, 2009 and 2014, \nthe writ of the state has expanded across the country, and socio-economic \ndevelopment has led to growth in gross domestic product per capita from $186 in \n2002 to $688 in 2012. The Millennium Development Goals Report, 2012, suggests \nthat Afghanistan should be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for \neducation and health by its target year, 2020. Over 30 per cent of central \ngovernment employees are women, and 28 per cent of the seats in the national \nparliament are reserved for women. With regard to proxy indicators used to \ndetermine multidimensional poverty levels, health and education show considerable \nimprovement: infant mortality rates declined by more than 50 per cent between 2003 \nand 2012, and net enrolment in primary school rose from 54 per cent in 2003 to \n77 per cent in 2013. \n3. Progress has been uneven, however, across development sectors, between \nincome groups, between men and women, and between rural and urban areas, and \nthe country still faces conditions of fragility, a reduction of economic growth, and, \ncurrently, an acute cash crisis. Based on an analysis of development needs and \nguided by national development policies, as reflected in the United Nations \nDevelopment Assistance Framework, the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework, \nthe national priority programmes and the emerging \u2018New Deal\u2019 agenda, as well as \nthe lessons learned reflected in the assessment of development results and the \nUnited Nations common country assessment, the United Nations family and partners \nhave agreed to five outcomes to address fragility in its many dimensions and the \nroot causes of conflict: (a) equitable economic development; (b) social services; \n(c) social equity and investment in human capital, (d) justice and the rule of law; \nand (e) accountable governance. Responding to the Kabul Conference request for a \nunified United Nations system, the United Nations country team has committed to \nincreasing the effectiveness of the system. Furthermore, UNDP is supporting the \nimplementation of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States principle s with \nthe Ministry of Finance. The five New Deal peacebuilding and state building goals, \nleading to conflict transformation, will act as a foundation for progress towards the \nnational priority programmes and will guide the Government towards inclusive, \ncountry-led and country-owned strategies. As part of the New Deal, and in line with \nthe Monterrey, Rome, Paris, Accra and Busan aid effectiveness principles, UNDP is \nengaging in better aid management to gradually align development financing with national priorities, donor initiatives, country systems and accountability systems \nsuch as the Development Assistance Database, and is ensuring harmonized, sector\u0002wide approaches to the allocation of resources.\n4. The outcome areas of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework \nsuggest that interventions are most effective when the responsibilities of duty -\nbearers and the rights of claim-holders are addressed. For peacebuilding to succeed, \nmoreover, development solutions must tackle the root causes of conflict and \nexclusion. UNDP will follow an issues-based approach addressing some of the key \nlinks and the nexus between conflict and better governance, and between poverty \nand community resilience. As the assessment of development results highlights, \nUNDP work across a range of governance and rule of law issues at the national and \nsubnational levels is seen as particularly valuable, and of clear comparative \nadvantage in Afghanistan. Yet UNDP achieved only limited results in increased \nopportunities for income generation, pointing to a need to intensify its work in the \narea of sustainable livelihoods for poverty reduction and, where possible, regional \nand triangular cooperation. A conflict development analysis conducted by UNDP in \n2013 \u2014 which helped identify root causes of conflict in Afghanistan \u2014 underscores \nthe need to work towards poverty reduction and accountable governance. The \nassessment identified several causes of conflict and fragility. They include \npatronage-based politics, political exclusion, economic insecurity, ineffective \ngovernance, a weak state justice system, and unequal distribution of scarce \nlivelihood resources.\n5. Governance deficits are both a cause and a consequence of fragility. \nAccountable governance at all levels must be promoted to address exclusion in \nAfghanistan. The role of Parliament and subnational governance institutions must be \nconsolidated, and a strong link between state institutions, civil society and the \nprivate sector forged, to strengthen peacebuilding. Governance institutions need \ntime to mature to enable state services to reach all citizens. Due primarily to \nconcerns about capacity and corruption, significant international assistance bypasses \ngovernment systems. This has led to the creation of parallel structures and, notably, \na \u2018parallel civil service\u2019. To assist in strengthening the primary civil service, UNDP \nwill ensure that its capacity development efforts do not lead to capacity substitution. \nIt has already aligned its support with the national technical assistance policy.\nUNDP has been an active player in accountable governance since 2002. Having \nsupported, effectively, all presidential and parliamentary elections, increased the \ncapacity of parliament and strengthened subnational governance at the provincial \nand district levels, UNDP will deepen its engagement in participatory approaches \nand will work closely with national partners, including the Afghanistan Independent \nHuman Rights Commission.\n6. Access to justice and the rule of law emerges as an area where Afghan men \nand women have high expectations. The police, numbering close to 150,000 men \nand women, will gradually transition from their paramilitary role to a more civilian \none aimed at promoting the safety and security of all citizens. In light of lessons \nfrom the Justice and Human Rights in Afghanistan project, this must be achieved in \na framework of stronger governance of the justice sector and the police in order to \nstrengthen the entire justice chain and address corruption, taking into account the \nunique nature of Afghanistan with its plural legal traditions. A survey conducted by \nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the High Office of Oversight and \nAnti-corruption in 2012 found that 73 per cent of Afghan people consider the court system to be the most corrupt state institution. Afghanistan needs significant support \nto meet human rights standards and the legal obligations as enshrined in its \nConstitution. The largest UNDP programme in the world, the Law and Order Trust \nFund for Afghanistan, involves supporting the police, through payroll and the \nMinistry of Interior, in making the transition from a paramilitary force to a civilian \npolice service. This, together with support to the Ministry of Justice and access to \njustice initiatives, especially for women, will constitute an integrated approach to \njustice sector reform and development. The Law and Order Trust Fund itself, as a \nmajor financial disbursement mechanism, needs to be redefined.\n7. Economic development and poverty alleviation through area-based approaches \nand regional and South-South cooperation to address exclusion, the \u2018youth bulge\u2019, \nand community resilience are also essential for progress. About 36 per cent of the \nAfghan population live below the national poverty line, a situation that has \nremained unchanged in over six years. The share of the working population in \nvulnerable employment is 79 per cent for men and 87 per cent for women \n(2011-2012), highlighting the fragility of the economy and the potential for large \nparts of the population to fall further into poverty when confronted with shocks or \nnatural disasters. Since over 80 per cent of the population depend on natural \nresources for their livelihoods \u2014 in a socio-political environment dominated by \npatronage networks \u2014 poverty reduction in Afghanistan requires direct intervention \nto ensure equitable access to assets such as land and water. Furthermore, about \n250,000 Afghan people are affected by natural disasters yearly, and the country has \n650,000 conflict-induced internally displaced persons. Large rural populations \nremain without access to affordable energy, vital for local economic development. \nUNDP already provides support to all provinces, and about 80 per cent of all \ndistricts, to improve planning, budgeting and implementation of a produc tive \ninfrastructure more conducive to local development. This support should be scaled \nup to address issues of income generation and sustainable livelihoods, especially for \nyoung people, through entrepreneurship development and employment creation. \nUNDP will also enhance the provision of energy, support environmental governance \nand build resilience to climate change and disasters.\n8. In 2012, the Gender Inequality Index listed Afghanistan 147th out of \n148 countries. Women are often the most vulnerable to the effects of conflict and \npoverty, and regularly face gender-based violence. Despite some improvement in \nwomen\u2019s conditions, social, cultural and religious practices continue to limit their \nrights and quality of life. Building on the foundations of a gender equality project \nand gender mainstreaming across its entire portfolio during recent years, UNDP will \nselect critical ministries and certain key provinces to advocate for Security Council \nresolutions 1325 and 2122 and to promote women\u2019s empowerment and the \nmonitoring mechanism to ensure that national and international legislation and \nrights are protected, with special attention to gender-based violence. The \nMillennium Declaration acknowledged that gender equality is both a goal in itself \nand a condition for achieving the other Millennium Development Goals. The \nNational Risk and Vulnerability Assessment, 2011-2012, noted that only 19 per cent \nof the working-age women are currently active in the labour market, compared to \n80 per cent of men. Finally, although the number of registered cases of violence \nagainst women has decreased slightly, from 6,796 cases in 2008 to 6,000 in 2012, \nthe actual number of incidents of violence against women, as the Government \nacknowledged in the Millennium Development Goals Report, 2012, is much higher, as a large number of incidents go unreported. The data clearly indicate that although \nsome progress has been made in the condition of women, especially girls, those \ngains remain fragile and reversible.\n9. The outlook for Afghanistan over the course of the country programme is \nuncertain, due to a range of economic, social, political, and security challenges. The \ninternational community plays an important role in helping the country navigate this \nperiod from transition to transformation and achieve the goal of self-reliance. The \nyears to come will be characterized by a reduced international footprint and a likely \nreduction in the role of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan \n(UNAMA). As the focus of assistance from the international community evolves \nfrom supporting security and stabilization to sustainable development and resilience, \nUNDP is planning its interventions based on assumptions derived from discussions \nof possible future scenarios. UNDP will increase its added value by rebalancing its \nprogramme and maintaining a flexible stance. This will be accomplished based on a \nflexible regional presence, innovative and expanding partnerships and funding \nsources, and nimble risk management. As part of the new United Nations \nDevelopment Assistance Framework, UNDP and United Nations partners will \nidentify how to work together by geographical sector and area. At the national level, \nUNDP will focus on electoral processes and seek to build government capacity to \nassume responsibility for the management of a civilian police force. To address \ndisparities across the country, UNDP will strengthen livelihoods and community \nresilience at the subnational level, and will assist Afghanistan in tackling poverty \nand sustaining economic gains. UNDP will address the marginalization of women \nand vulnerable groups by strengthening its work with state and non-state actors, \ncivil society and local communities. It will seek to diversify its funding partners, \nfocusing initially on the Global Environment Facility and the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The impact of UNDP work will bring greater \npolitical, social, and economic opportunities for all Afghans, better systems for \naccountable governance through the rule of law, and social inclusion. UNDP \ncommits to allocate 15 per cent of its resources to gender equality and women\u2019s \nempowerment.\n#II. Programme priorities and partnerships \n10. The country programme seeks to achieve transformational change in an \nenvironment of great complexity and insecurity. UNDP will continue to adapt to a \nchanging national context in four of the five United Nations Development \nAssistance Framework outcomes outlined below, and will take on leadership or \nfacilitation roles in those areas as requested. Conflict sensitivity will be applied \nthroughout the programme and will be mainstreamed in all projects. Political, \neconomic, and conflict analysis of the provinces where UNDP is working will be \nundertaken through its regional hubs at the subnational level. This will be \naccompanied by greater use of national systems, a focus on capacity development \ninstead of capacity substitution, and assistance with phasing out parallel structures \nand strengthening approaches to regionalization. For each country programme \noutcome, UNDP will prepare an outcome strategy document, in consultation with all \npartners and the new Government and in the light of the evolving UNAMA mandate \nafter 2015.11. UNDP will ensure that four cross-cutting parameters or guiding principles are \naddressed in the outcome strategies of the country programme to be prepared after \nthe document has been approved. They are: \n(a) Area-based approaches for better targeting of beneficiaries. \nSocio-economic and baseline analysis in pilot regions and provinces will be carried \nout to ensure that direct benefits accrue to policymakers, the poor, women, and other \nselected beneficiaries, such as internally displaced persons. Participatory planning \nwill foster community ownership, leading to sustainable interventions through \nconflict-sensitive programming, the rights-based approach and \u2018do no harm\u2019 \nprinciples.\n(b) Scalability of results and use of multidisciplinary approaches. Using an \nissues-based approach, UNDP will ensure that synergies between outcomes and \nfields of work are established to ensure accelerated progress towards specified \ngoals, fostering development impact and social cohesion.\n(c) Partnership building. This will involve a greater use of state and \nnon-state actors in Afghanistan, and at the regional and global levels through South\u0002South cooperation, to ensure that the best national and international comparative \nexperience can be integrated into the country programme outcome areas of work.\n(d) Use of national systems and \u2018Serving as One\u2019. Serving as One \napproaches incorporating the use of integrated work plans and joint programmes, \ncoordinated through outcome-specific inter-agency working groups, have been \nagreed to.\n12. Outcome 1 of the country programme document, on accountable governance, \naddresses governance deficits and responds to the need to strengthen the \naccountability of institutions and promote civil service reform, with special \nattention to selected regions and provinces. UNDP will seek to promote:\n(a) Inclusive political processes and representative institutions. In \ncoordination with UNAMA, UNDP electoral cycle support will assist national \ninstitutions in the better management of presidential, parliamentary and local \nelection processes. UNDP is already a partner of the key electoral bodies. UNDP \nwill support the National Assembly in building capacities to deliver on its \nconstitutional mandate. At the subnational level, UNDP will engage with the new \nGovernment to discuss policy options, including on fiscal decentralization and \naccountability mechanisms, for improved participation and inclusive decision\u0002making, including by acknowledging the specific role of traditional governance \nsystems such as Shuras and Jirgas in the Afghan context. UNDP is also planning to \nstrengthen the capacities of elected provincial councils, district coordination \ncouncils and municipal boards. This will further the institutionalization of \ndemocratic processes as well as ensure equitable economic development and \npromotion of justice, the rule of law and women\u2019s rights as core priorities of UNDP \ndevelopment interventions at the subnational level.\n(b) Institutional capacity for peace-building. Building on the Afghanistan \nPeace and Reintegration Programme and possible successor arrangements, UNDP \nwill adopt a two-pronged approach to address the root causes of conflict: (i) At the \nnational level, UNDP will work closely with UNAMA and the Ministry of Finance \nto support policy formulation, including through the use of such tools as the \nimplementation of the New Deal agenda and the incorporation of peacebuilding and state building indicators into government planning processes; and (ii) At the \nprovincial and district levels, UNDP will promote community-centred solutions to \nconflict through mediation efforts by provincial councils, district coordination \ncouncils, as well as involving traditional Shuras and Jirgas, and will facilitate \nequitable local access and management of natural resources. With UNDP support, \ndistrict coordination councils will be established by the Government in three \nprovinces initially, and will then be progressively scaled up based on access and \nsecurity conditions. As was highlighted in a risk analysis report prepared for UNDP \nin 2013, the country office will develop typologies for cross-cutting and politically \nsensitive risks when addressing peacebuilding interventions. Risk management \napproaches would guide the scalability of these interventions.\n(c) Capacity development for better service delivery. UNDP will assist in \nimproving technical capacities in key ministries and governance bodies at the \ncentral as well as the subnational level. Capacities for planning, budget execution, \ntransparency and accountability are a priority. This will include anti-corruption \ninitiatives. Key partners will include the Civil Service Commission, the World Bank \nand the United Nations country team, to ensure harmonization of efforts. At the \nsubnational level, support provided to provincial governors\u2019 offices will be \ndeepened through an area-based approach at the district level, in accordance with \nthe UNDP regionalization strategy. This will include at least 50 per cent support \nprovided through the national budget, a minimum of 80 per cent alignment to the \nnational priority programmes, and collaboration with the \u2018capacity-building for \nresults\u2019 initiative of the World Bank, which aims to enhance the service delivery \ncapacities of key line agencies. UNDP, together with other donors, has been engaged \nin helping the Ministry of Finance to prepare the first public financial management \nroadmap and will provide support in the formulation of the second. The public \nfinancial management action plan will set out the government agenda to strengthen \neffective delivery of the national budget and increase transparency and \naccountability so as to advance anti-corruption initiatives, making use of South\u0002South and triangular cooperation.\n13. Outcome 2 of the country programme document, on justice and the rule of \nlaw, seeks to expand trust in access to justice systems, with a particular focus on \nmarginalized people and the poor; support institutional reform and legislative \ndevelopment; and increase civilian oversight over the police and the justice system. \nWith the objective of increasing trust in, and access to, the fair, effective, and \naccountable rule of law, two intervention areas are envisaged: \n(a) Justice and police governance. UNDP will build on its support to \nnational sector-wide reforms and continue its collaboration with UNAMA and other \nactors, including members of the Rule of Law and Justice Donor Group, working in \nthe areas of justice and police governance to enhance trust in justice institutions. \nLinkages between the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s Office, and the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, and between formal and \ninformal justice service providers, will ensure policy harmonization, as \nrecommended by the Assessment of Development Results which recognizes \nUNDP\u2019s clear comparative advantage. Within the Ministry of Interior and the \nMinistry of Justice, reforms in core planning processes, as well as finance, budget \nexecution and human resource management, will be supported. In the Ministry of \nInterior, police professionalization and capacity development, linked to the national \npolice programme and the five-year strategic plan of the Ministry, will allow government to take responsibility for the police payroll, where a transfer to \ngovernment is planned based on a jointly agreed capacity development assessment \nand risk management strategy. In the Ministry of Justice, UNDP will continue to \nassist the human rights support unit to expand human rights-compliant laws. \nExternal oversight of justice and the police will be strengthened through the \nIndependent Human Rights Commission, civil society and parliament. Capacity \ndevelopment support to the parliamentary committee on finance and budgets will \nassist parliament in its oversight of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of \nInterior. In coordination with the national working group on rule of law indicators, \nUNDP will support the formulation and monitoring of indicators on the \neffectiveness of justice services as well as the human rights due diligence policy on \nUnited Nations support to non-United Nations security forces. Control and \ncomplaints mechanisms will be supported to reduce maladministration, abuse of \nauthority and misconduct.\n(b) Access to justice and police services. UNDP will focus on scaling up and \nimproving the civil, criminal and administrative justice services. This will involve \nstrengthening coordination throughout the justice chain, including the Ministry of \nInterior and the Ministry of Justice. The capacity of the national police remains a \nweak link in the criminal justice chain, and UNDP, in coordination with other \ngroups active in the police sector, will focus on the development and \nimplementation of an Afghan-led police professionalization strategy. Literacy, \ncriminal investigations, violence against women, collaboration with prosecutors, \njuvenile justice, and community-oriented policing will be important components of \nthis approach. UNDP will work with the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and \nUNFPA to address the special needs of minors and women. Starting with 10 districts \nacross six target provinces in 2015, UNDP will scale up its interventions to\n100 districts across 20 provinces in five years, in line with its regionalization \nstrategy and according to access and security conditions and application of risk \nmanagement approaches.\n14. Outcome 3 of the country programme document promotes development that is \nequitable and inclusive. It seeks to address the high levels of poverty and \nvulnerability throughout the country, focusing on women and youth, who face \ngreater poverty and are more vulnerable. Poverty exists across all regions, and the \npoorer provinces are often the most inaccessible. The outcome will include new \napproaches to conflict prevention and resilience by increasing equitable access to \nnatural resources and addressing climate change adaptation and disaster risk \nmanagement. A three-pronged approach will be followed:\n(a) Sustainable livelihood opportunities. UNDP will undertake initiatives to \nfacilitate local economic development in an inclusive manner by helping to create \nbetter economic opportunities for vulnerable populations, especially women and \nunemployed youth, through area-based approaches linked to provincial and district \ndevelopment plans, which UNDP has been engaged in since 2002 through the \nMinistry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development. UNDP seeks to work with local \ngovernance bodies, civil society partners and private sector institutions to promote \neconomic opportunities at the local level. At the national level, UNDP will support \nkey economic policies called for in the national priority programmes related to \nregional integration and economic cooperation. At the provincial and district levels, \nUNDP will promote livelihood opportunities in the rural economy by strengthening \nthe marketable skills of unemployed youth, promoting the development of entrepreneurship, supporting small-scale infrastructure, and fostering access to \nmarkets and sharia-compliant finance. This could include targeted support to \ndurable solutions for displaced populations, and it is expected to discourage poppy \ncultivation. As part of larger efforts of regional integration, UNDP may undertake \nstudies and provide policy advisory services to strengthen the efforts of those \ninvolved in the Istanbul Process, the Istanbul Programme of Action for Least \nDeveloped Countries, and possibly the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation Programme. South-South and triangular cooperation with Tajikistan \nand other central Asian countries is already taking place in areas such as \nemployment and local trade. Expanding the domestic revenue base is a government \npriority, and it is anticipated that the extractive industries will create revenue \nstreams for development financing. Communities will be identified based on food \ninsecurity and poverty levels, and in discussions with provincial development \ncouncils and district coordination councils, with a phased approach linked to the \nUNDP regionalization strategy. \n(b) Improved access to energy and natural resources and enhanced \nenvironmental governance. UNDP will deepen its engagement in issues that directly \naddress access to natural resources and their equitable management. Environmental \ngovernance at governmental and community levels, as an integral component of \nsustainable development, will be strengthened thorough policies, plans and legal \ninstruments as new opportunities with the Global Environment Facility are \nidentified. The promotion of off-grid, community-managed and owned, clean and \nrenewable energy services will be a specific focus area. Initial pilot projects will \ntarget seven provinces for three years. Those provinces will be identified by the \nMinistry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, the Ministry of Energy and \nWater, and UNDP, based on energy deficits, need, and potential for energy \ngeneration. Work will be scaled up after three years. Policy-level work in this sector \nwill include the development of legal and regulatory instruments for rural energy at \nthe village level, as well as improving the interface between the national and \nvillage-level energy structures. In the extractive industries sector, UNDP will work \non an initiative with the World Bank, the National Environmental Protection \nAgency, the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock, and the Ministry of \nMines, to reduce the negative effects of mining on ecosystems and to ensure \ncommunity involvement. \n(c) Resilience to natural disasters and enhanced adaptation to emerging \nclimate change priorities. UNDP will assist in establishing national and community\u0002based early warning systems which, together with mainstreaming risk management \ninto local development plans, will enhance the resilience of communities both to \nrapid-onset natural disasters and, more generally, to climate change in the medium \nto long term. National climate change policies, as well as five disaster-prone \nprovinces, will be identified, in collaboration with the Afghanistan National Disaster \nManagement Authority and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs, to strengthen the humanitarian-development nexus. The \nprovinces will be selected based on their risk profile and their susceptibility to high \nclimate change impact. Support will be scaled up to 10 provinces by the end of the \nprogramme period. Policy formulation work will include assistance on finalizing a \nclimate change strategy and action plan with the National Environmental Protection \nAgency, while regional cooperation for disaster risk management will be pursued \nthrough the Istanbul Process. It is expected that, during the country programme cycle, most provinces and about 50 per cent of the districts in the country will be \ntargeted under the three outputs of this outcome.\n15. Outcome 4 of the country programme document addresses social equity, with \nspecial attention on women. It responds to the political, economic, and social \ninequalities between Afghan men and women, and continuing gender-based \ndiscrimination and violence. Gender will be mainstreamed into all outcomes. In \ncooperation with the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, UNAMA and UN-Women, \nUNDP will focus on three interventions:\n(a) Government capacity to meet women\u2019s rights. UNDP will support the \nGovernment in implementing legal commitments, both national and international, \nthat affect the lives of women. UNDP will work with select ministries and advocate \nfor Security Council resolutions 1325 and 2122. Working at the planning and policy \nlevel, six pilot ministries will be assisted in ensuring that women\u2019s empowerment \npriorities are incorporated into the formulation of their budgets and multi-year \nsectoral plans at both the national and subnational levels. To increase the \nresponsiveness of government ministries to citizens\u2019 rights, UNDP supports \nadvocacy, through civil society organizations and women\u2019s groups, for the inclusion \nof emerging citizen priorities in national and subnational planning frameworks.\n(b) Enhance monitoring and oversight of the national women\u2019s agenda. In \naddition to the capacity to implement technical and financial support, in partnership \nwith civil society organizations, through advocacy measures, UNDP will strengthen \nthe capacity of the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs and civil society organizations to \nmonitor and report on the implementation of the international and national \ncommitments of the Government. UNDP will make use of new technology and \nknowledge-sharing platforms, such as cooperation exchange mechanisms, to achieve \nthat aim. UNDP will assist in the establishment of a database to monitor the \nprogress of the National Action Plan for the Women of Afghanistan, to be used for \nevidence-based policymaking, budgeting, and reporting.\n(c) Strengthen enforcement of legislation on violence against women. \nPrevention of gender discrimination and gender-based violence will be addressed \nthrough capacity development interventions to ensure that the Government is able to \nimplement the recommendations of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms \nof Discrimination against Women. At the subnational level, elimination of violence \nagainst women units, family response units and legal help centres, already \nestablished to support the national elimination of violence against women law, will \nhelp strengthen the justice chain, improve links with civil society organizations, and \nrespond to gender-based violence.\n16. Recognizing the challenge of access at the subnational level due to insecurity \nand limited infrastructure, and the need to ensure closer monitoring of projects and \ninteractions with beneficiaries, UNDP is implementing a regionalization strategy \nthat will transform UNDP project-based hubs into UNDP regional sub-offices. This \nwill be complemented by partnership and communication strategies and a risk \nmanagement strategy \u2014 which are being developed \u2014 that will propose an outreach \nmodel at the regional and provincial levels, in addition to approaches for scaling up \ninterventions. The UNDP regional hubs will be co-located with other United Nations \norganizations, where possible, to guide area-based programming and synergies \namong outcomes. Eight hubs have been established (Balkh, Bamyan, Helmand, \nHerat, Kandahar, Kunduz, Nangarhar and Paktia). Greater proximity to communities will enable UNDP to better assess needs, improve targeting of interventions, collect \nbetter-quality data, and facilitate the monitoring of activities. Regionalization will \nimprove programme synergies and increase operational efficiency thanks to \nclustering and common premises and services. It will also strengthen coordination \nwith other United Nations organizations. While this regionalization strategy presents \ncertain risks related to security, access, oversight capacity and financial \nsustainability, the sub-offices, by improving interactions with local partners, \ncollecting better local knowledge and data, and conducting provincial conflict \nanalysis, will allow programmes to be scaled up and expanded through scenario \nplanning when security conditions and infrastructure become more favourable. \n17. UNDP will increasingly focus on \u2018upstream\u2019 policy-level engagement, \ngradually moving away from service delivery functions that may substitute for \ngovernment capacity. Bilateral partners will be involved in providing inputs to the \nstrategic direction of UNDP at the outcome level, in the light of existing donor \nprogrammes in those areas \u2014 as well as with respect to management results, \nincluding regionalization and risk management. This will be done through use of \nsuch forums as a strategic high-level meeting every two months, chaired by the \nDeputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General/Resident Representative, \nand, at a more technical level, through the Donor Advisory Group and engagement \nin donor coordination groups such as the rule of law and justice donor group. \nMechanisms such as joint provincial visits and sharing of data from sub-offices \nwould be additional means of cooperation. Recognizing the importance of regional \ncooperation for Afghanistan, UNDP will increasingly rely on arrangements for \nSouth-South and triangular cooperation, both at the project level and in multilateral \npolicy-level frameworks. Engagement in the Istanbul Process will be increased, and \nsupport will be provided to national institutions to implement two \u2018confidence\u0002building measures\u2019 related to (a) trade, commerce and investment opportunities, and \n(b) disaster management.\n18. As the assessment of development results notes, UNDP must increase its ties \nwith civil society, both as a means of delivering its programmes and to enhance \naccountability, counter corruption, and promote gender equality. Supporting claim\u0002holders at the local level, UNDP will assist in empowering communities through \nawareness-raising and capacity development to increase their access to services and \nfulfilment of their rights. This could include people with disabilities and those living \nwith HIV. This will be done through various channels, including the establishment \nof a United Nations Volunteers-supported national volunteer programme to mobilize \nyouth in development, with access to resources from funds such as the Global Fund. \nAt the central level, UNDP engages with civil society organizations through the \nnewly established Civil Society Advisory Committee, through which the \norganizations provide strategic as well as technical input to UNDP programmes. In \nrelevant areas, UNDP will increasingly reach out and include private sector \nrepresentatives, such as chambers of commerce, as members of local consultative \nmechanisms, encouraging them to mobilize finance to support local economic \ndevelopment.\n#III. Programme and risk management \n19. This country programme document outlines UNDP contributions to national \nresults and serves as the primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board for results alignment and resources assigned to the programme at the country level. \nAccountabilities of managers at the country, regional and headquarters levels with \nrespect to country programmes are prescribed in the UNDP programme and \noperations policies and procedures and its internal controls framework. National \nexecution will be the preferred modality, to be replaced by direct execution for all or \npart of the programme if required to enable response to major capacit y weaknesses \nand/or force majeure. Specific implementation modalities will be agreed upon with \nGovernment and will be selected depending on need and capacity. \n20. The country office will rearrange its internal programme structure to deliver \nthe four outcomes, and each outcome will be housed in one programme team. This \nwill increase programme coherence and allow for an issues-based approach to \nproviding development solutions. Operational changes will be made following the \nUNDP global clustering strategy, with key functions shifting to consolidated service \ncentres in various regions \u2014 in the case of Afghanistan, to Kuala Lumpur and \nBangkok. This will assist with service efficiency and effectiveness. Working in \nsupport of the Serving as One approach, UNDP will work with the United Nations \nCountry Team and the programme management team to implement United Nations \nDevelopment Assistance Framework integrated work plans. UNDP will support joint \ncapacity assessments and a common approach to risk management, ensuring full \ncompliance with the principles of the harmonized approach to cash transfers. A \nUnited Nations Working Group is already active in this area. Initiatives such as \nco-location will be advanced through the United Nations Operations Management \nTeam and in the light of changes in the UNAMA presence.\n21. The most significant risks faced by UNDP are related to security, political, and \nfiduciary concerns, all of which will have to be addressed if the programme is to \nsucceed. To facilitate a targeted risk mitigation strategy, UNDP has created three \ncategories: strategic, external and internal risks. Strategic risks include political \npressure, implementation modality constraints, and limitations related to on-budget \ndelivery mechanisms. External risks include reduced access at the subnational and \ncommunity levels due to deterioration in security conditions, shrinking donor funds, \nweak infrastructure, limited capacity of implementing partners, and corruption. \nInternal risks include staff turnover and capacity, and inadequacy of oversight and \naccountability measures and financial management systems. The impact of these \ncould include reputational loss, mismanagement of funds, inefficiency in \nprogramme interventions, and inability to implement, monitor and evaluate \nactivities effectively. The transition in the Law and Order Trust Fund for \nAfghanistan, in particular, will require a targeted risk management approach.\n22. The UNDP risk management strategy is based on a stronger partnership \nengagement and lessons learned from the assessment of development results, the \nactivities of the Oversight and Compliance Unit, and the regular audits and spot\u0002checks carried out regularly by the country office. Risk assessments, monitoring, \nand regular reviews will be undertaken with stakeholders. These will include the \nproactive use of programme criticality assessments and innovative approaches for \ndata collection and analysis of results. These mechanisms will be built into project \ndesign, project approval processes, project monitoring requirements, performance \nassessments, and project closure mechanisms. In keeping with a cohesive United \nNations approach, a risk management unit has been created within the Resident \nCoordinator\u2019s Office to facilitate joint United Nations positioning and advocacy, and \nto provide tools and support mechanisms for risk management and risk sharing.23. To ensure continuity in the event of a security breakdown, a business \ncontinuity plan has been developed. The oversight and compliance unit in the \ncountry office is the primary body to ensure the implementation of risk management \nsystems. UNDP has also established a dedicated audit and investigations capacity, \nand programme criticality levels have been established for UNDP activities, all of \nwhich are undertaken in compliance with this United Nations-wide framework. \n#IV. Monitoring and evaluation\n24. Operating in a fragile context with high levels of insecurity, minimal local \ninformation management systems, and a lack of comprehensive, accurate data has \nbeen a key challenge for monitoring and evaluation efforts. Limited reach in many \nrural areas, combined with capacity constraints of the Government and local bodies \nin terms of information collection, make it difficult to undertake accurate needs\u0002based planning and effective follow-up, monitoring and evaluation. These \nchallenges have cost implications at the programme and project levels which will \nhave to be addressed.\n25. The new country programme will intensify efforts in monitoring and utilizing \ndata collection to continuously assess impact. The organizational platforms used \nwill include the Data for Development Group led by UNFPA, the United Nations \nWorking Group on Monitoring and Evaluation, and UNDP subnational offices, in \naccordance with the regionalization strategy. UNDP will work with the Resident \nCoordinator\u2019s office and the United Nations PMT to establish a consolidated data \ncollection mechanism within the Resident Coordinator\u2019s office. UNDP will also use \nthe newly established Civil Society Advisory Committee as a mechanism through \nwhich to partner with selected civil society organizations to monitor programmes in \ntheir respective areas of expertise. Emphasis will be placed on ensuring that impact \nat the outcome level is monitored, so as to build on output-level measures of \nsuccess.\n26. The UNDP monitoring and evaluation system will build on project progress \nreports and reviews, as well as on outcome and programme evaluations. This will \nfacilitate the validation of results, the generation of lessons learned and the \ncontinuous assessment of UNDP contributions to outcomes. It will enable UNDP to \ntake advantage of new opportunities and adjust expectations in response to changes \nin the external environment, including security conditions. Specific monitoring and \nevaluation methods will include third-party monitoring, regular UNDP verification \nmissions, and quantitative surveys. UNDP and the United Nations system as a whole \nwill explore satellite surveillance, mobile phone monitoring, and the use of other \ninnovative methodologies for monitoring in fragile and insecure environments. \n27. UNDP will support joint United Nations efforts to develop national \ninstitutional capacity to collect, update, analyse and utilize statistical and \nmonitoring data to strengthen evidenced-based development policies and strategies \nthrough national systems. The country office will work with the Central Statistics \nOrganization, and will use its periodic national risk and vulnerability assessment as \na major source of subnational-level data. UNDP will support certain counterpart \nministries in collecting data related to their sectors. This includes working with \ngovernment agencies in developing systems for collecting, storing and analysing \ndata related to monitoring government commitments as part of the Afghanistan \ncountry programme."}
