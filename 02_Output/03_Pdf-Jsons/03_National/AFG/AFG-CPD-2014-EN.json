Programme rationale 1. The Afghanistan \u2018Transformation Decade\u2019 begins in 2015. With presidential elections in 2014, the withdrawal of international troops, and the closure of provincial reconstruction teams, Afghanistan continues its journey towards self - reliance. The coming years will be marked by the full sovereignty of Afghanistan over its political, security and development processes. The international community and the United Nations will continue to support Afghanistan, as exemplified in the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework and the Chicago commitments on development and security. As Afghanistan enters its Transformation Decade, UNDP should also transition to meet emerging priorities and operational challenges, guided by the United Nations Development Assistance Framework and the new strategic plan, 2014-2017. 2. Considerable development gains have been made since 2001, despite the continued insurgency in parts of the country \u2014 a conflict that led to close to 9,000 civilian casualties in 2013. Presidential elections were held in 2004, 2009 and 2014, the writ of the state has expanded across the country, and socio-economic development has led to growth in gross domestic product per capita from $186 in 2002 to $688 in 2012. The Millennium Development Goals Report, 2012, suggests that Afghanistan should be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for education and health by its target year, 2020. Over 30 per cent of central government employees are women, and 28 per cent of the seats in the national parliament are reserved for women. With regard to proxy indicators used to determine multidimensional poverty levels, health and education show considerable improvement: infant mortality rates declined by more than 50 per cent between 2003 and 2012, and net enrolment in primary school rose from 54 per cent in 2003 to 77 per cent in 2013. Progress has been uneven, however, across development sectors, between 3. income groups, between men and women, and between rural and urban areas, and the country still faces conditions of fragility, a reduction of economic growth, and, currently, an acute cash crisis. Based on an analysis of development needs and guided by national development policies, as reflected in the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework, the national priority programmes and the emerging \u2018New Deal\u2019 agenda, as well as the lessons learned reflected in the assessment of development results and the United Nations common country assessment, the United Nations family and partners have agreed to five outcomes to address fragility in its many dimensions and the root causes of conflict: (a) equitable economic development; (b) social services; (c) social equity and investment in human capital, (d) justice and the rule of law; and (e) accountable governance. Responding to the Kabul Co nference request for a unified United Nations system, the United Nations country team has committed to increasing the effectiveness of the system. Furthermore, UNDP is supporting the implementation of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States principle s with the Ministry of Finance. The five New Deal peacebuilding and state building goals, leading to conflict transformation, will act as a foundation for progress towards the national priority programmes and will guide the Government towards inclusive, country-led and country-owned strategies. As part of the New Deal, and in line with the Monterrey, Rome, Paris, Accra and Busan aid effectiveness principles, UNDP is engaging in better aid management to gradually align development financing with 2/19 14-57366 DP/DCP/AFG/3 national priorities, donor initiatives, country systems and accountability systems such as the Development Assistance Database, and is ensuring harmonized, sector - wide approaches to the allocation of resources. The outcome areas of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework 4. suggest that interventions are most effective when the responsibilities of duty - bearers and the rights of claim-holders are addressed. For peacebuilding to succeed, moreover, development solutions must tackle the root causes of conflict and exclusion. UNDP will follow an issues-based approach addressing some of the key links and the nexus between conflict and better governance, and between poverty and community resilience. As the assessment of development results highlights, UNDP work across a range of governance and rule of law issues at the national and subnational levels is seen as particularly valuable, and of clear comparative advantage in Afghanistan. Yet UNDP achieved only limited results in increased opportunities for income generation, pointing to a need to intensify its work in the area of sustainable livelihoods for poverty reduction and, where possible, regional and triangular cooperation. A conflict development analysis conducted by UNDP in 2013 \u2014 which helped identify root causes of conflict in Afghanistan \u2014 underscores the need to work towards poverty reduction and accountable governance. The assessment identified several causes of conflict and fragility. They include ineffective patronage-based politics, political exclusion, economic governance, a weak state justice system, and unequal distribution of scarce livelihood resources. insecurity, 5. Governance deficits are both a cause and a consequence of fragility. Accountable governance at all levels must be promoted to address exclusion in Afghanistan. The role of Parliament and subnational governance institutions must be consolidated, and a strong link between state institutions, civil society and the private sector forged, to strengthen peacebuilding. Governance institutions n eed time to mature to enable state services to reach all citizens. Due primarily to concerns about capacity and corruption, significant international assistance bypasses government systems. This has led to the creation of parallel structures and, notably, a \u2018parallel civil service\u2019. To assist in strengthening the primary civil service, UNDP will ensure that its capacity development efforts do not lead to capacity substitution. It has already aligned its support with the national technical assistance policy. UNDP has been an active player in accountable governance since 2002. Having supported, effectively, all presidential and parliamentary elections, increased the capacity of parliament and strengthened subnational governance at the provincial and district levels, UNDP will deepen its engagement in participatory approaches and will work closely with national partners, including the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. 6. Access to justice and the rule of law emerges as an area where Afghan men and women have high expectations. The police, numbering close to 150,000 men and women, will gradually transition from their paramilitary role to a more civilian one aimed at promoting the safety and security of all citizens. In light of lessons from the Justice and Human Rights in Afghanistan project, this must be achieved in a framework of stronger governance of the justice sector and the police in order to strengthen the entire justice chain and address corruption, taking into account the unique nature of Afghanistan with its plural legal traditions. A survey conducted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the High Office of Oversight and Anti-corruption in 2012 found that 73 per cent of Afghan people consider the court 14-57366 3/19 DP/DCP/AFG/3 system to be the most corrupt state institution. Afghanistan needs significant support to meet human rights standards and the legal obligations as enshrined in its Constitution. The largest UNDP programme in the world, the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan, involves supporting the police, through payroll and the Ministry of Interior, in making the transition from a paramilitary force to a civilian police service. This, together with support to the Ministry of Justice and access to justice initiatives, especially for women, will constitute an integrated approach to justice sector reform and development. The Law and Order Trust Fund itself, as a major financial disbursement mechanism, needs to be redefined. 7. Economic development and poverty alleviation through area -based approaches and regional and South-South cooperation to address exclusion, the \u2018youth bulge\u2019, and community resilience are also essential for progress. About 36 per cent of the Afghan population live below the national poverty line, a situation that has remained unchanged in over six years. The share of the working population in vulnerable employment is 79 per cent for men and 87 per cent for women (2011-2012), highlighting the fragility of the economy and the potential for large parts of the population to fall further into poverty when confronted with shocks or natural disasters. Since over 80 per cent of the population depend on natural resources for their livelihoods \u2014 in a socio-political environment dominated by patronage networks \u2014 poverty reduction in Afghanistan requires direct intervention to ensure equitable access to assets such as land and water. Furthermore, about 250,000 Afghan people are affected by natural disasters yearly, and the country has 650,000 conflict-induced internally displaced persons. Large rural populations remain without access to affordable energy, vital for local economic development. UNDP already provides support to all provinces, and about 80 per cent of all districts, to improve planning, budgeting and implementation of a produc tive infrastructure more conducive to local development. This support should be scaled up to address issues of income generation and sustainable livelihoods, especially for young people, through entrepreneurship development and employment creation. UNDP will also enhance the provision of energy, support environmental governance and build resilience to climate change and disasters. In 2012, the Gender Inequality Index listed Afghanistan 147th out of 8. 148 countries. Women are often the most vulnerable to the effects of conflict and poverty, and regularly face gender-based violence. Despite some improvement in women\u2019s conditions, social, cultural and religious practices continue to limit their rights and quality of life. Building on the foundations of a gender equality project and gender mainstreaming across its entire portfolio during recent years, UNDP will select critical ministries and certain key provinces to advocate for Security Council resolutions 1325 and 2122 and to promote women\u2019s empowerment and th e monitoring mechanism to ensure that national and international legislation and to gender-based violence. The rights are protected, with special attention Millennium Declaration acknowledged that gender equality is both a goal in itself and a condition for achieving the other Millennium Development Goals. The National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment, 2011-2012, noted that only 19 per cent of the working-age women are currently active in the labour market, compared to 80 per cent of men. Finally, although the number of registered cases of violence against women has decreased slightly, from 6,796 cases in 2008 to 6,000 in 2012, the actual number of incidents of violence against women, as the Government acknowledged in the Millennium Development Goals Report, 2012, is much higher, 4/19 14-57366 DP/DCP/AFG/3 as a large number of incidents go unreported. The data clearly indicate that although some progress has been made in the condition of women, especially girls, those gains remain fragile and reversible. The outlook for Afghanistan over the course of the country programme is 9. uncertain, due to a range of economic, social, political, and security challenges. The international community plays an important role in helping the country navigate this period from transition to transformation and achieve the goal of self-reliance. The years to come will be characterized by a reduced international footprint and a likely reduction in the role of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). As the focus of assistance from the international community evolves from supporting security and stabilization to sustainable development and resilience, UNDP is planning its interventions based on assumptions derived from discussions of possible future scenarios. UNDP will increase its added value by rebalancing its programme and maintaining a flexible stance. This will be accomplished based on a flexible regional presence, innovative and expanding partnerships and funding sources, and nimble risk management. As part of the new United Nations Development Assistance Framework, UNDP and United Nations partners will identify how to work together by geographical sector and area. At the national level, UNDP will focus on electoral processes and seek to build government capacity to assume responsibility for the management of a civilian police force. To address disparities across the country, UNDP will strengthen livelihoods and community resilience at the subnational level, and will assist Afghanistan in tackling poverty and sustaining economic gains. UNDP will address the marginalization of women and vulnerable groups by strengthening its work with state and non -state actors, civil society and local communities. It will seek to diversify its funding partners, focusing initially on the Global Environment Facility and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The impact of UNDP work will bring greater political, social, and economic opportunities for all Afghans, better systems for accountable governance through the rule of law, and social inclusion. UNDP commits to allocate 15 per cent of its resources to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. II. Programme priorities and partnerships 10. The country programme seeks to achieve transformational change in an environment of great complexity and insecurity. UNDP will continue to adapt to a changing national context in four of the five United Nations Development Assistance Framework outcomes outlined below, and will take on leadership or facilitation roles in those areas as requested. Conflict sensitivity will be applied throughout the programme and will be mainstreamed in all projects. Political, economic, and conflict analysis of the provinces where UNDP is working will be undertaken through its regional hubs at the subnational level. This will be accompanied by greater use of national systems, a focus on capacity development instead of capacity substitution, and assistance with phasing out parallel structures and strengthening approaches to regionalization. For each country programme outcome, UNDP will prepare an outcome strategy document, in consultation with all partners and the new Government and in the light of the evolving UNAMA mandate after 2015. 14-57366 5/19 DP/DCP/AFG/3 11. UNDP will ensure that four cross-cutting parameters or guiding principles are addressed in the outcome strategies of the country programme to be prepared after the document has been approved. They are: for better approaches (a) Area-based beneficiaries. Socio-economic and baseline analysis in pilot regions and provinces will be carried out to ensure that direct benefits accrue to policymakers, the poor, women, and other selected beneficiaries, such as internally displaced persons. Participatory planning will foster community ownership, leading to sustainable intervention s through conflict-sensitive programming, the rights-based approach and \u2018do no harm\u2019 principles. targeting of (b) Scalability of results and use of multidisciplinary approaches. Using an issues-based approach, UNDP will ensure that synergies between outcomes and fields of work are established to ensure accelerated progress towards specified goals, fostering development impact and social cohesion. (c) Partnership building. This will involve a greater use of state and non-state actors in Afghanistan, and at the regional and global levels through South- South cooperation, to ensure that the best national and international comparative experience can be integrated into the country programme outcome areas of work. (d) Use of national systems and \u2018Serving as One\u2019. Serving as One approaches incorporating the use of integrated work plans and joint programmes, coordinated through outcome-specific inter-agency working groups, have been agreed to. 12. Outcome 1 of the country programme document, on accountable governance, addresses governance deficits and responds the accountability of institutions and promote civil service reform, with special attention to selected regions and provinces. UNDP will seek to promote: to strengthen the need to (a) institutions. representative Inclusive political processes and In coordination with UNAMA, UNDP electoral cycle support will assist national institutions in the better management of presidential, parliamentary and local election processes. UNDP is already a partner of the key electoral bodies. UNDP will support the National Assembly in building capacities to deliver on its constitutional mandate. At the subnational level, UNDP will engage with the new Government to discuss policy options, including on fiscal decentralization and accountability mechanisms, for improved participation and inclusive decision - making, including by acknowledging the specific role of traditional governance systems such as Shuras and Jirgas in the Afghan context. UNDP is also planning to strengthen the capacities of elected provincial councils, district coordination councils and municipal boards. This will further the institutionalization of democratic processes as well as ensure equitable economic development and promotion of justice, the rule of law and women\u2019s rights as core priorities of UNDP development interventions at the subnational level. (b) Institutional capacity for peace-building. Building on the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Programme and possible successor arrangements, UNDP will adopt a two-pronged approach to address the root causes of conflict: (i) At the national level, UNDP will work closely with UNAMA and the Ministry of Finance to support policy formulation, including through the use of such tools as the implementation of the New Deal agenda and the incorporation of peacebuilding and 6/19 14-57366 DP/DCP/AFG/3 state building indicators into government planning processes; and (ii) At the provincial and district levels, UNDP will promote community-centred solutions to conflict through mediation efforts by provincial council s, district coordination councils, as well as involving traditional Shuras and Jirgas, and will facilitate equitable local access and management of natural resources. With UNDP support, district coordination councils will be established by the Government i n three provinces initially, and will then be progressively scaled up based on access and security conditions. As was highlighted in a risk analysis report prepared for UNDP in 2013, the country office will develop typologies for cross -cutting and politically sensitive risks when addressing peacebuilding interventions. Risk management approaches would guide the scalability of these interventions. (c) Capacity development for better service delivery. UNDP will assist in improving technical capacities in key ministries and governance bodies at the central as well as the subnational level. Capacities for planning, budget execution, transparency and accountability are a priority. This will include anti -corruption initiatives. Key partners will include the Civil Service Commission, the World Bank and the United Nations country team, to ensure harmonization of efforts. At the subnational level, support provided to provincial governors\u2019 offices will be deepened through an area-based approach at the district level, in accordance with the UNDP regionalization strategy. This will include at least 50 per cent support provided through the national budget, a minimum of 80 per cent alignment to the national priority programmes, and collaboration with the \u2018capacity-building for results\u2019 initiative of the World Bank, which aims to enhance the service delivery capacities of key line agencies. UNDP, together with other donors, has been engaged in helping the Ministry of Finance to prepare the first public financial management roadmap and will provide support in the formulation of the second. The public financial management action plan will set out the government agenda to strengthen effective delivery of transparency and accountability so as to advance anti-corruption initiatives, making use of South- South and triangular cooperation. the national budget and increase 13. Outcome 2 of the country programme document, on justice and the rule of law, seeks to expand trust in access to justice systems, with a particular focus on marginalized people and the poor; support institutional reform and legislative development; and increase civilian oversight over the police and the justice system. With the objective of increasing trust in, and access to, the fair, effective, and accountable rule of law, two intervention areas are envisaged: (a) Justice and police governance. UNDP will build on its support to national sector-wide reforms and continue its collaboration with UNAMA and other actors, including members of the Rule of Law and Justice Donor Group, working in the areas of justice and police governance to enhance trust in justice institutions. Linkages between the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the Attorney General\u2019s Office, and the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, and betwee n formal and informal justice service providers, will ensure policy harmonization, as recommended by the Assessment of Development Results which recognizes UNDP\u2019s clear comparative advantage. Within the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Justice, reforms in core planning processes, as well as finance, budget execution and human resource management, will be supported. In the Ministry of Interior, police professionalization and capacity development, linked to the national police programme and the five-year strategic plan of the Ministry, will allow 14-57366 7/19 DP/DCP/AFG/3 government to take responsibility for the police payroll, where a transfer to government is planned based on a jointly agreed capacity development assessment and risk management strategy. In the Ministry of Justice, UNDP will continue to assist the human rights support unit to expand human rights-compliant laws. External oversight of justice and the police will be strengthened through the Independent Human Rights Commission, civil society and parliament. Capaci ty development support to the parliamentary committee on finance and budgets will assist parliament in its oversight of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Interior. In coordination with the national working group on rule of law indicators, UNDP will support the effectiveness of justice services as well as the human rights due diligence policy on United Nations support to non-United Nations security forces. Control and complaints mechanisms will be supported to reduce maladministration, abuse of authority and misconduct. the formulation and monitoring of indicators on in the police sector, will (b) Access to justice and police services. UNDP will focus on scaling up and improving the civil, criminal and administrative justice services. This will involve strengthening coordination throughout the justice chain, including the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Justice. The capacity of the national police remains a weak link in the criminal justice chain, and UNDP, in coordination with other the development and groups active implementation of an Afghan-led police professionalization strategy. Literacy, criminal investigations, violence against women, collaboration with prosecutors, juvenile justice, and community-oriented policing will be important components of this approach. UNDP will work with the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and UNFPA to address the special needs of minors and women. Starting with 10 districts across six target provinces in 2015, UNDP will scale up its interventions to 100 districts across 20 provinces in five years, in line with its regionalization strategy and according to access and security conditions and application of risk management approaches. focus on 14. Outcome 3 of the country programme document promotes development that is equitable and inclusive. It seeks to address the high levels of poverty and vulnerability throughout the country, focusing on women and youth, who face greater poverty and are more vulnerable. Poverty exists across all regions, and the poorer provinces are often the most inaccessible. The outcome will include new approaches to conflict prevention and resilience by increasing equitable access to natural resources and addressing climate change adaptation and disaster risk management. A three-pronged approach will be followed: (a) Sustainable livelihood opportunities. UNDP will undertake initiatives to facilitate local economic development in an inclusive manner by helping to create better economic opportunities for vulnerable populations, especially w omen and unemployed youth, through area-based approaches linked to provincial and district development plans, which UNDP has been engaged in since 2002 through the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development. UNDP seeks to work with local governance bodies, civil society partners and private sector institutions to promote economic opportunities at the local level. At the national level, UNDP will support key economic policies called for in the national priority programmes related to regional integration and economic cooperation. At the provincial and district levels, UNDP will promote livelihood opportunities in the rural economy by strengthening the marketable skills of unemployed youth, promoting the development of 8/19 14-57366 DP/DCP/AFG/3 entrepreneurship, supporting small-scale infrastructure, and fostering access to markets and sharia-compliant finance. This could include targeted support to durable solutions for displaced populations, and it is expected to discourage poppy cultivation. As part of larger efforts of regional integration, UNDP may undertake studies and provide policy advisory services to strengthen the efforts of those involved in the Istanbul Process, the Istanbul Programme of Action for Least Developed Countries, and possibly the Central Asia Regional Econom ic Cooperation Programme. South-South and triangular cooperation with Tajikistan and other central Asian countries is already taking place in areas such as employment and local trade. Expanding the domestic revenue base is a government priority, and it is anticipated that the extractive industries will create revenue streams for development financing. Communities will be identified based on food insecurity and poverty levels, and in discussions with provincial development councils and district coordination councils, with a phased approach linked to the UNDP regionalization strategy. (b) Improved access to energy and natural resources and enhanced environmental governance. UNDP will deepen its engagement in issues that directly address access to natural resources and their equitable management. Environmental governance at governmental and community levels, as an integral component of sustainable development, will be strengthened thorough policies, plans and legal instruments as new opportunities with the Global Environment Facility are identified. The promotion of off-grid, community-managed and owned, clean and renewable energy services will be a specific focus area. Initial pilot projects will target seven provinces for three years. Those provinces will be identified by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, the Ministry of Energy and Water, and UNDP, based on energy deficits, need, and potential for energy generation. Work will be scaled up after three years. Policy -level work in this sector will include the development of legal and regulatory instruments for rural energy at the village level, as well as improving the interface between the national and village-level energy structures. In the extractive industries sector, UNDP will work on an initiative with the World Bank, the National Environmental Protection Agency, the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock, and the Ministry of Mines, to reduce the negative effects of mining on ecosystems and to ensure community involvement. (c) Resilience to natural disasters and enhanced adaptation to emerging climate change priorities. UNDP will assist in establishing national and community- based early warning systems which, together with mainstreaming risk management into local development plans, will enhance the resilience of communities both to rapid-onset natural disasters and, more generally, to climate change in the medium to long term. National climate change policies, as well as five disaster -prone provinces, will be identified, in collaboration with the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, to strengthen the humanitarian-development nexus. The provinces will be selected based on their risk profile a nd their susceptibility to high climate change impact. Support will be scaled up to 10 provinces by the end of the programme period. Policy formulation work will include assistance on finalizing a climate change strategy and action plan with the National E nvironmental Protection Agency, while regional cooperation for disaster risk management will be pursued through the Istanbul Process. It is expected that, during the country programme 14-57366 9/19 DP/DCP/AFG/3 cycle, most provinces and about 50 per cent of the districts in the coun try will be targeted under the three outputs of this outcome. 15. Outcome 4 of the country programme document addresses social equity, with special attention on women. It responds to the political, economic, and social inequalities between Afghan men and women, and continuing gender-based discrimination and violence. Gender will be mainstreamed into all outcomes. In cooperation with the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, UNAMA and UN -Women, UNDP will focus on three interventions: (a) Government capacity to meet women\u2019s rights. UNDP will support the Government in implementing legal commitments, both national and international, that affect the lives of women. UNDP will work with select ministries and advocate for Security Council resolutions 1325 and 2122. Working at the planning and policy level, six pilot ministries will be assisted in ensuring that women\u2019s empowerment priorities are incorporated into the formulation of their budgets and multi -year sectoral plans at both the national and subnational levels. To increase the responsiveness of government ministries to citizens\u2019 rights, UNDP supports advocacy, through civil society organizations and women\u2019s groups, for the inclusion of emerging citizen priorities in national and subnational planning frameworks. (b) Enhance monitoring and oversight of the national women\u2019s agenda. In addition to the capacity to implement technical and financial support, in partnership with civil society organizations, through advocacy measures, UNDP will strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs and civil society organizations to monitor and report on the implementation of the international and national commitments of the Government. UNDP will make use of new technology and knowledge-sharing platforms, such as cooperation exchange mechanisms, to achieve that aim. UNDP will assist in the establishment of a database to monitor the progress of the National Action Plan for the Women of Afghanistan, to be used for evidence-based policymaking, budgeting, and reporting. (c) Strengthen enforcement of legislation on violence against women . Prevention of gender discrimination and gender-based violence will be addressed through capacity development interventions to ensure that the Government is able to implement the recommendations of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. At the subnational level, elimination of violence against women units, family response units and legal help centres, already established to support the national elimination o f violence against women law, will help strengthen the justice chain, improve links with civil society organizations, and respond to gender-based violence. 16. Recognizing the challenge of access at the subnational level due to insecurity and limited infrastructure, and the need to ensure closer monitoring of projects and interactions with beneficiaries, UNDP is implementing a regionalization strategy that will transform UNDP project-based hubs into UNDP regional sub-offices. This will be complemented by partnership and communication strategies and a risk management strategy \u2014 which are being developed \u2014 that will propose an outreach model at the regional and provincial levels, in addition to approaches for scaling up interventions. The UNDP regional hubs will be co-located with other United Nations organizations, where possible, to guide area-based programming and synergies among outcomes. Eight hubs have been established (Balkh, Bamyan, Helmand, Herat, Kandahar, Kunduz, Nangarhar and Paktia). Greater proximity to communities 10/19 14-57366 DP/DCP/AFG/3 will enable UNDP to better assess needs, improve targeting of interventions, collect better-quality data, and facilitate the monitoring of activities. Regionalization will improve programme synergies and increase operational efficiency t hanks to clustering and common premises and services. It will also strengthen coordination with other United Nations organizations. While this regionalization strategy presents certain financial sustainability, the sub-offices, by improving interactions with local partners, collecting better local knowledge and data, and conducting provincial conflict analysis, will allow programmes to be scaled up and expanded through scenario planning when security conditions and infrastructure become more favourable. to security, access, oversight capacity and risks related 17. UNDP will increasingly focus on \u2018upstream\u2019 policy-level engagement, gradually moving away from service delivery functions that may substitute for government capacity. Bilateral partners will be involved in providing inputs to the strategic direction of UNDP at the outcome level, in the light of existing donor programmes in those areas \u2014 as well as with respect to management results, including regionalization and risk management. This will be done t hrough use of such forums as a strategic high-level meeting every two months, chaired by the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General/Resident Representative, and, at a more technical level, through the Donor Advisory Group and engagement in donor coordination groups such as the rule of law and justice donor group. Mechanisms such as joint provincial visits and sharing of data from sub -offices would be additional means of cooperation. Recognizing the importance of regional cooperation for Afghanistan, UNDP will increasingly rely on arrangements for South-South and triangular cooperation, both at the project level and in multilateral policy-level frameworks. Engagement in the Istanbul Process will be increased, and support will be provided to national institutions to implement two \u2018confidence- building measures\u2019 related to (a) trade, commerce and investment opportunities, and (b) disaster management. 18. As the assessment of development results notes, UNDP must increase its ties with civil society, both as a means of delivering its programmes and to enhance accountability, counter corruption, and promote gender equality. Supporting claim - holders at the local level, UNDP will assist in empowering communities through awareness-raising and capacity development to increase their access to services and fulfilment of their rights. This could include people with disabilities and those living with HIV. This will be done through various channels, including the establishment of a United Nations Volunteers-supported national volunteer programme to mobilize youth in development, with access to resources from funds such as the Global Fund. At the central level, UNDP engages with civil society organizations through the newly established Civil Society Advisory Committee, the organizations provide strategic as well as technical input to UNDP programmes. In relevant areas, UNDP will increasingly reach out and include private sector representatives, such as chambers of commerce, as members of local consul tative mechanisms, encouraging them to mobilize finance to support local economic development. through which III. Programme and risk management 19. This country programme document outlines UNDP contributions to national results and serves as the primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board for 14-57366 11/19 DP/DCP/AFG/3 results alignment and resources assigned to the programme at the country level. Accountabilities of managers at the country, regional and headquarters levels with respect to country programmes are prescribed in the UNDP programme and operations policies and procedures and its internal controls framework. National execution will be the preferred modality, to be replaced by direct execution for all or part of the programme if required to enable response to major capacit y weaknesses and/or force majeure. Specific implementation modalities will be agreed upon with Government and will be selected depending on need and capacity. 20. The country office will rearrange its internal programme structure to deliver the four outcomes, and each outcome will be housed in one programme team. This will increase programme coherence and allow for an issues -based approach to providing development solutions. Operational changes will be made following the UNDP global clustering strategy, with key functions shifting to consolidated service centres in various regions \u2014 in the case of Afghanistan, to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. This will assist with service efficiency and effectiveness. Working in support of the Serving as One approach, UNDP will work with the United Nations Country Team and the programme management team to implement United Nations Development Assistance Framework integrated work plans. UNDP will support joint capacity assessments and a common approach to risk management, ensuring full compliance with the principles of the harmonized approach to cash transfers. A United Nations Working Group is already active in this area. Initiatives such as co-location will be advanced through the United Nations Operations Management Team and in the light of changes in the UNAMA presence. 21. The most significant risks faced by UNDP are related to security, political, and fiduciary concerns, all of which will have to be addressed if the programme is to succeed. To facilitate a targeted risk mitigation strategy, UNDP has created three categories: strategic, external and internal risks. Strategic risks include political pressure, implementation modality constraints, and limitations related to on -budget delivery mechanisms. External risks include reduced access at the subnational and community levels due to deterioration in security conditions, shrinking donor funds, weak infrastructure, limited capacity of implementing partners, and corruption. Internal risks include staff turnover and capacity, and inadequacy of oversight and accountability measures and financial management systems. The impact of these could in programme interventions, and inability to implement, monitor and evaluate activities effectively. The transition in the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan, in particular, will require a targeted risk management approach. loss, mismanagement of reputational inefficiency include funds, 22. The UNDP risk management strategy is based on a stronger partnership engagement and lessons learned from the assessment of development results, the activities of the Oversight and Compliance Unit, and the regular audits and spot - checks carried out regularly by the country office. Risk assessments, monitoring, and regular reviews will be undertaken with stakeholders. These will include the proactive use of programme criticality assessments and innovative approaches for data collection and analysis of results. These mechanisms will be built into project design, project approval processes, project monitoring requirements, performance assessments, and project closure mechanisms. In keeping with a cohesive United Nations approach, a risk management unit has been created within the Resident Coordinator\u2019s Office to facilitate joint United Nations positioning and adv ocacy, and to provide tools and support mechanisms for risk management and risk sharing. 12/19 14-57366 DP/DCP/AFG/3 23. To ensure continuity in the event of a security breakdown, a business continuity plan has been developed. The oversight and compliance unit in the country office is the primary body to ensure the implementation of risk management systems. UNDP has also established a dedicated audit and investigations capacity, and programme criticality levels have been established for UNDP activities, all of which are undertaken in compliance with this United Nations-wide framework. IV. Monitoring and evaluation 24. Operating in a fragile context with high levels of insecurity, minimal local information management systems, and a lack of comprehensive, accurate data has been a key challenge for monitoring and evaluation efforts. Limited reach in many rural areas, combined with capacity constraints of the Government and local bodies in terms of information collection, make it difficult to undertake accurate needs - based planning and effective follow-up, monitoring and evaluation. These challenges have cost implications at the programme and project levels which will have to be addressed. 25. The new country programme will intensify efforts in monitoring and utilizing data collection to continuously assess impact. The organizational platforms used will include the Data for Development Group led by UNFPA, the United Nations Working Group on Monitoring and Evaluation, and UNDP subnational offices, in accordance with the regionalization strategy. UNDP will work with the Resident Coordinator\u2019s office and the United Nations PMT to establish a consolidated data collection mechanism within the Resident Coordinator\u2019s office. UNDP will also use the newly established Civil Society Advisory Committee as a mechanism through which to partner with selected civil society organizations to monitor programmes in their respective areas of expertise. Emphasis will be placed on ensuring that impact at the outcome level is monitored, so as to build on output -level measures of success. 26. The UNDP monitoring and evaluation system will build on project progress reports and reviews, as well as on outcome and programme evaluations. This will facilitate the validation of results, the generation of lessons learned and the continuous assessment of UNDP contributions to outcomes. It will enable UNDP to take advantage of new opportunities and adjust expectations in response to changes in the external environment, including security conditions. Specific monitoring and evaluation methods will include third-party monitoring, regular UNDP verification missions, and quantitative surveys. UNDP and the United Nations system as a whole will explore satellite surveillance, mobile phone monitoring, and the use of other innovative methodologies for monitoring in fragile and insecure environments. joint United Nations efforts to develop national 27. UNDP will support to collect, update, analyse and utilize statistical and institutional capacity monitoring data to strengthen evidenced-based development policies and strategies through national systems. The country office will work with the Central Statistics Organization, and will use its periodic national risk and vulnerability assessment as a major source of subnational-level data. UNDP will support certain counterpart ministries in collecting data related to their sectors. This includes working with government agencies in developing systems for collecting, storing and analysing data related to monitoring government commitments as pa rt of the Afghanistan country programme. 14-57366 13/19 / D P D C P A F G / 3 / Annex.
