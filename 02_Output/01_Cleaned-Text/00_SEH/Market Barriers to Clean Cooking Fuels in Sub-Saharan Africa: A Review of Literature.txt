Cooking Fuels in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Review of Literature
This working paper assesses the full range of modern-fuel alternatives, and
discusses the main market barriers – which are economic, social and political –
to their uptake. Published on 13 March 2009 Citation Schlag, N., Zuzarte, F.

Working Paper. In the developing nations of sub-Saharan Africa, providing
households with modern energy services is a critical step towards development. A
large majority of households in the region rely on traditional biomass fuels for
cooking, which represent a significant proportion of energy used in the domestic
setting. The disadvantages of these fuels are many: they are inefficient energy
carriers and their heat is difficult to control; they produce dangerous
emissions; and their current rate of extraction is not sustainable for forests.
Transition to clean cooking fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or
ethanol would resolve many of these issues as they do not produce dangerous
particulate emissions, and are commercially viable, offering a number of socio-
economic advantages over traditional options. Despite the benefits of fuel
switching, clean cooking fuels are rarely used in households in sub-Saharan
Africa. Their failure to attain widespread use can be attributed to a number of
market barriers. One of the major issues is cost: clean cooking fuels are
prohibitively expensive for many households, and the high price of compatible
stoves further discourages their use. Besides the expense, many consumers are
hesitant to adopt the new technology, reflecting the lack of public awareness of
the relevant issues. At the same time, Africa’s underdeveloped infrastructure
prevents these fuels from being made available in many local marketplaces. To
date, this combination of factors has largely stifled the transitionto clean
cooking fuels. National governments can adopt a number of strategies to address
these issues. The creation of clean cooking-fuel initiatives at the national
level would be an important first step, after which governments can begin to
address the issues more effectively. The introduction of relevant financial
instruments would help to tackle the economic barriers to clean cooking fuels,
and public outreach and education could overcome socio-cultural obstacles.
Through such a policy framework, national governments can play a significant
role in encouraging the transition to clean cooking fuels. Locality:  Global
