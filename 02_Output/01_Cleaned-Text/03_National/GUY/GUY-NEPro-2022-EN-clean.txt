(MWh/kWp) Biomass potential: net primary production Indicators of renewable
resource potential   Solar PV: Solar resource potential has been divided into
seven classes, each representing  range of annual PV output per unit of capacity
(kWh/kWp/yr) The bar chart shows the proportion of  country' land area in each
of these classes and the global distribution of land area across the classes
(for comparison)     Onshore wind: Potential wind power density (/m2) is shown
in the seven classes used by NREL, measured at  height of 100m The bar chart
shows the distribution of the country' land area in each of these classes
compared to the global distribution of wind resources Areas in the third class
or above are considered to be  good wind resource   Biomass: Net primary
production (NPP) is the amount of carbon fixed by plants and accumulated as
biomass each year It is  basic measure of biomass productivity The chart shows
the average NPP in the country (tC/ha/yr), compared to the global average NPP of
- tonnes of carbon 10  tC/ha/yr 200  11 = Global average of - tC/ha/yr Sources:
IRENA statistics, plus data from the following sources: UN SDG Database
(original sources: WHO; World Bank; IEA; IRENA; and UNSD); UN World Population
Prospects; UNSD Energy Balances; UN COMTRADE; World Bank World Development
Indicators; EDGAR; REN21 Global Status Report; IEA -IRENA Joint Policies and
Measures Database; IRENA Global Atlas; and World Bank Global Solar Atlas and
Global Wind Atlas Additional notes: Capacity per capita and public investments
SDGs only apply to developing areas Energy self-sufficiency has been defined as
total primary energy production divided by total primary energy supply Energy
trade includes all commodities in Chapter 27 of the Harmonised System (HS)
Capacity utilisation is calculated as annual generation divided by year-end
capacity  ,760h/year Avoided emissions from renewable power is calculated as
renewable generation divided by fossil fuel generation multiplied by reported
emissions from the power sector This assumes that, if renewable power did not
exist, fossil fuels would be used in its place to generate the same amount of
power and using the same mix of fossil fuels In countries and years where no
fossil fuel generation occurs, an average fossil fuel emission factor has been
used to calculate the avoided emissions These profiles have been produced to
provide an overview of developments in renewable energy in different countries
and areas The IRENA statistics team would welcome comments and feedback on its
structure and content, which can be sent to statistics@irenaorg IRENA
