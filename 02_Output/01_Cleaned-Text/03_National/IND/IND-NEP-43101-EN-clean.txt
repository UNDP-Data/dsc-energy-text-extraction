of national grid including type of transmission systems and requirement of
redundancies; and   Different technologies available for efficient generation,
transmission and distribution  Fuel choices based on economy, energy security
and environmental considerations While evolving the National Electricity Plan,
CEA will consult all the stakeholders including State Governments and the State
Governments would, at state level, undertake this exercise in coordination with
stakeholders including distribution licensees and State Transmission Utilities
(STUs) While conducting studies periodically to assess short- term and long-term
demand, projections made by distribution utilities would be given due weightage
CEA will also interact with institutions and agencies having economic expertise,
particularly in the field of demand forecasting Projected growth rates for
different sectors of the economy will also be taken into account in the exercise
of demand forecasting Accordingly, the first National Electricity Plan covering
the review of 10th plan, detailed plan for 11th plan and perspective Plan for
12th Plan was notified in the Gazette in August, The Second National Electricity
Plan covering the review of 11th plan, detailed plan for 12th plan and

public  summary of PREAMBLE xviii Central Electricity Authority National
Electricity Plan relevant comments received from various stakeholders, along
with the action taken thereof, is given in Table  below Summary of Comments
received on Draft Report of National Electricity Plan (Generation) Table
MODIFICATION IN NEP NO SUMMARY OF THE COMMENTS ACTION TAKEN  POSOCO Demand
projections The following two issues have been left out in arriving at projected
demand The Final NEP is based on projections of 19th EPS  No () Impact of space
cooling requirements on power demand; (ii) Impact of electric vehicle mobility
on power demand It has been recommended in NEP for mid-term review of EPS Based
on the review, NEP would be revised, if required List of power plants considered
for is given as Annexure in NEP EGEAS outputs are voluminous Inclusion of these
as  part of NEP unnecessarily increase the volume Will be done, if required,
after mid-term review of EPS Percentage of coal-based plants affected due to
water scarcity is quite low when compared with the total installed capacity of
the coal-based plants in the country With of renewable energy sources in the
grid, coal based plants are expected to run at  low PLF which will also reduce
their water requirement As suggested, included in NEP Further detailed studies
may be needed the correlation between emission and cycling The manpower
projections and training the requirement period  and  requirement of include
system planners and operators The microscopic categorization It is suggested
that NEP may be reviewed at least once in two years  No It is suggested that the
list of the power plants planned for retirement, which is of the order of 5200
MW, may be given in annexure  retirement Yes Various outputs from EGEAS Software
may be given as an Annexure to the NEP  No would It might be worthwhile to
consider studying  lower growth rate of say %  No There is an inherent
assumption that coal plants would not face water scarcity in case of failure of
monsoon  integration the No Some power plants have very poor levels of fly ash
utilization is now this  Yes NREL Report concludes that there is hardly any
impact on emissions due to frequent cycling and ramping of the power plants
establish to  No for There is  need to include system planners and system
operators also in the capacity building and training programmes  No the PREAMBLE
xix Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan in the Skill taken
care is Development Plan of the MoP Storage technology is in nascent stage and
it would be premature to discuss in detail in NEP about its implementation
impact in load management cost- effectiveness Taken care of  separate chapter on
storage technologies could also be added 10 No vis--vis 11  Minor typographical
errors in draft NEP MAHAVITRAN- MAHARASHTRA  realistic Demand projection for
next five years (FY2017-18 to FY ) is required Overstated demand would result in
stranded capacity and corresponding Transmission Capacity in requirement, which
increase in consumer tariff Distribution Licensee wise projected demand needs to

Outside the scope of NEP No “where the gas sold or purchased and transported
through  common carrier pipeline or any other common transport or distribution
system becomes comingled and fungible with other gas in the pipeline or system
and such gas is introduced in the pipeline or system in one State and is taken
out from the pipeline in another State, such sale or purchase of gas shall be
deemed to be  moment of good from one State to another” Not feasible due to
technical difficulties No With this there is  free flow of RLNG from West to
East coast of India One of the key aspects on the regulatory front will be to
declare the Gas based power plants as clean and green energy plants OTPC If the
adequate quantum of gas is not available, then the entire objective of low
carbon growth may get jeopardized in absence of balancing mechanism Outside the

56 % of total capacity addition during 12th plan has come from private sector
There has been considerable slippage against the capacity addition target in
respect of Hydro (,451 MW) and Nuclear (,300 MW) during the 12th Plan period
During 12th plan, capacity addition from supercritical technology based coal

required during the period 2017-However,  total capacity of 47,855 MW coal based
power projects are currently under different stages of construction and are
likely to yield benefits during the period 2017-Thereby, the total capacity
addition during  is likely to be ,76,140 MW An alternate scenario has also been
constructed, considering demand CAGR of 18% during the years  and keeping other
parameters unchanged It was found that 19,700 MW coal based capacity addition
would then be required during the years , in case of increased demand scenario
However, coal based capacity of 47,855 MW are at different stages of

results reveal that capacity addition of 46,420 MW is required during the period
2022-This capacity addition required during , as shown in the results is, in
fact, the peaking capacity requirement to be met in the grid This capacity
requirement can be met from any conventional source of energy but preferably
from peaking power plants like Hydro, Gas or Energy Storage Devices Considering
the generation capacity addition mentioned in 13 and 14 above, the share of non-

INTRODUCTION  BACKGROUND Growth of Power sector is key to the economic
development of the country as it facilitates development across various sectors
of the economy, such as manufacturing, agriculture, commercial enterprises and
railways Since independence the power sector in India has grown considerably
However, the enactment of Electricity Act, 2003, has brought in revolutionary
changes in almost all the areas of the sector Through this Act  conducive
environment has been created to promote private sector participation and
competition in the sector by providing  level playing field This has led to
significant investment in generation, transmission and distribution areas Over
the years the installed capacity of Power Plants (Utilities) has increased to
,26,833 MW as on 2017 from  meagre ,713 MW in Similarly, the electricity
generation increased from about  Billion units in 1950 to ,242 BU (including
imports) in the year 2016- The per capita consumption of electricity in the
country has also increased from 15 kWh in 1950 to about ,122 kWh in the year
2016-Out of ,97,464 census villages, ,92,135 villages (25%) have been
electrified as on Regional grids have been integrated into  single national grid
with effect from 2013 thereby providing free flow of power from one corner of
the country to another through strong inter regional AC and HVDC links As
result, the all India peak demand (MW) not met as well as energy (MU) not
supplied have registered steady decline The peak not met and energy not supplied
were  % and  % respectively during the year 2016- ELECTRICITY ACT 2003, NATIONAL
ELECTRICITY POLICY 2005 AND TARIFF POLICY 2016  Electricity Act 2003 and
Stipulations Regarding National Electricity Plan The Electricity Act, 2003
provides an enabling legislation conducive to development of the Power Sector in
transparent and competitive environment, keeping in view the interest of the
consumers As per Section () of the Electricity Act 2003, Central Electricity
Authority (CEA) is required to prepare  National Electricity Plan in accordance
with the National Electricity Policy and notify such Plan once in five years The
draft plan has to be published and suggestions and objections invited thereon
from licensees, generating companies and the public within the prescribed time
The Plan has to be notified after obtaining the approval of the Central
Government The National Electricity Policy stipulates that the Plan prepared by
CEA and approved by the Central Government can be used by prospective generating
companies, transmission utilities and transmission/distribution licensees as
reference document  National Electricity Policy 2005 and Stipulations Regarding
National Electricity Plan The Aims and Objectives of the National Electricity
Policy are as follows:  Access to Electricity - Available for all households in
next five years  Availability of Power - Demand to be fully met by Energy and
peaking shortages to be overcome and adequate spinning reserve to be available 
Supply of Reliable and Quality Power of specified standards in an efficient
manner and at reasonable rates  Per capita availability of electricity to be
increased to over 1000 units by  Minimum lifeline consumption of
unit/household/day as  merit good by year  Financial Turnaround and Commercial
Viability of the Electricity Sector  Protection of consumers’ interests
National Electricity Policy stipulates that the National Electricity Plan would
be for  short-term framework of five years while giving  15-year perspective and
would include:  Short-term and long term demand forecast for different regions;
 Suggested areas/locations for capacity additions in generation and
transmission keeping in view of the economics of generation and transmission,
losses in the system, load centre requirements, grid stability, security of
supply, INTRODUCTION  Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan
quality of power including voltage profile, etc; and environmental
considerations including rehabilitation and resettlement;  Integration of such
possible locations with transmission system and development of national grid
including type of transmission systems and requirement of redundancies; 
Different technologies available for efficient generation, transmission and
distribution  Fuel choices based on economy, energy security and environmental
considerations The Policy also stipulates that while evolving the National
Electricity Plan, CEA will consult all the stakeholders including State
Governments and the State Governments would, at State level, undertake this
exercise in coordination with stakeholders including distribution licensees and
State Transmission Utilities (STUs) While conducting studies periodically to
assess short-term and long-term demand, projections made by distribution
utilities would be given due weightage CEA will also interact with institutions
and agencies having economic expertise, particularly in the field of demand
forecasting Projected growth rates for different sectors of the economy will
also be taken into account in the exercise of demand forecasting The Policy
stipulates that in addition to enhancing the overall availability of installed
capacity to 85%,  spinning reserve of at least % at national level would be
needed to be created to ensure grid security, quality and reliability of power
supply The Policy states that efficient technologies, like super-critical
technology, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) etc and large size
units would be gradually introduced for generation of electricity as their cost
effectiveness gets established The present National Electricity Policy was
enunciated in 2005 and since then it’ various Aims and Objectives have achieved
different levels of implementation Keeping in view of these and to cater to the
further challenges of the sector, the National Electricity Policy is under
revision  Tariff Policy 2016 The Central Government has notified the revised
Tariff Policy vide Gazette notification dated 2016 in exercises of powers
conferred under section () of Electricity Act, The Tariff Policy has been
evolved in consultation with the State Governments, the Central Electricity
Authority (CEA), the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and various
stakeholders The objectives of this Tariff Policy are to: ) Ensure availability
of electricity to consumers at reasonable and competitive rates; ) Ensure
financial viability of the sector and attract investments; ) Promote
transparency, consistency and predictability in regulatory approaches across
jurisdictions and minimize perceptions of regulatory risks; ) Promote
competition, efficiency in operations and improvement in quality of supply; )
Promote generation of electricity from renewable sources; ) Promote
hydroelectric power generation including Pumped Storage Projects (PSP) to
provide adequate peaking reserves, reliable grid operation and integration of
variable renewable energy sources; ) Evolve  dynamic and robust electricity
infrastructure for better consumer services; ) Facilitate supply of adequate and
uninterrupted power to all categories of consumers; ) Ensure creation of
adequate capacity including reserves in generation, transmission and
distribution in advance, for reliability of supply of electricity to consumers

Reserve Margin and Hydro Thermal Mix Reserve margin of  system is defined as the
difference between the Installed Capacity and the peak load met as  percentage
of the peak load met This factor depends on  number of parameters, major ones
being the mode of power generation  hydro, thermal, renewable and the
availability of the generating stations which primarily is  function of forced
and planned shutdown of the generating units, capacity of the Discoms to procure
power The Reserve Margin has increased from 94% in  to 78% in March, The Hydro-
Thermal mix has been decreasing from 86% as on 31st March, 2012 to 92% in March,
2017 mainly due to reduced hydro capacity addition vis – –vis thermal capacity
addition during successive years Pattern of reserve margin and hydro thermal mix
is illustrated in the Exhibit  This increase in Reserve Margin is on account of

VARIOUS INITIATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT  Development of Power Projects On Tariff
Based Bidding Promotion of competition in the electricity industry in India is
one of the key objectives of the Electricity Act, 2003 (the Act) Competitive
procurement of electricity by the distribution licensees is expected to reduce
the overall cost of procurement of power and facilitate development of power
markets Section 61 & 62 of the Act provide for tariff regulation and
determination of tariff of generation, transmission, wheeling and retail sale of
electricity by the Appropriate Commission Section 63 of the Act states that –
“Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 62, the Appropriate Commission
shall adopt the tariff if such tariff has been determined through transparent
process of bidding in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central
Government” Tariff Policy was revised on 28th January, 2016 to facilitate
procurement of power on tariff based bidding As per the revised Tariff Policy
“All future requirement of power should continue to be procured competitively by
distribution licensees except in case of expansion of existing projects or where
there is  company owned or controlled by the State Government as an identified
developer and where regulator will need to restore to tariff determination based
on norms provided that expansion of generation capacity by private developers
for this purpose would be restricted to one time addition of not more than 100%
of the existing capacity” Power projects can be developed by States under Case
and Case II bidding as follows: () Where the location, technology or fuel is not
specified by the procurer (Case ); (ii) For hydro-power projects, load centre
projects or other location specific projects with specific fuel allocation such
as captive mines available, which the procurer intends to set up under tariff
based bidding process (Case ) The Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) for
Case-/UMPPs were reviewed and the Model Bidding Documents for construction and
operation of power generation projects/Ultra Mega Power Projects(UMPPs) on
Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) basis were issued on 20th
Sept, Further, Ministry of Power has appointed an Expert Committee to review the
Standard / Model Bidding Documents for UMPPs and other location specific
projects under Case- route The Expert Committee, after exhaustive
deliberations/discussions with various stakeholders, has INTRODUCTION  Central
Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan prepared revised SBDs and
Guidelines for UMPPs based on allocated Domestic Coal Blocks and submitted the
same to the Ministry of Power and the same is under the process of Inter-
Ministerial consultations The Expert Committee has also submitted its
recommendation for comments from various stakeholders and guidelines for
determination of tariff through UMPPs on imported coal Ministry of Power had
issued SBDs for Case- power projects on 27th March,The revised SBDs containing
Model RFQ, Model RFP, Model Power Sale Agreement as well as Guidelines to be
adopted by distribution licensees for procurement of electricity on Design,
Build, Finance, Own and Operate (DBFOO) basis were issued on 8th November,2013
and 9th November,2013 respectively Further, in order to ensure that the benefits
of coal block auction are passed on to the consumers, amendments to these
Guidelines have been issued vide Resolution No 23- & dated 16th April,
Development of Ultra Mega Power Projects For the development of coal based Ultra
Mega Power Projects (UMPPs) of about ,000 MW capacity each under tariff based
competitive bidding route using Supercritical Technology on build, own and
operate basis was launched by the Central Government in 2005-The UMPPs will be
located either at pit head based on domestic coal or at coastal locations based
on imported coal For UMPPs based on domestic coal, coal block will also be
allocated to the project developer The objective is to achieve faster capacity
addition and to minimize the cost of power to consumers due to economy of scale
Four UMPPs were awarded to the developers selected through tariff based
competitive bidding which are Mundra UMPP in Gujarat, Sasan UMPP in MP,
Krishnapatnam UMPP in AP and Tilaiya UMPP in Jharkhand All units of Mundra UMPP
(5X800 MW) and Sasan UMPP (6X660 MW) have been commissioned The developer of
Krishnapatnam Ultra Mega Power Project, namely / Coastal Andhra Power Ltd
(CAPL), had started the construction work but has stopped the construction work
citing new regulation of the Government of Indonesia as the reason which
prohibits sale of coal, including sale to affiliate companies, below bench mark
price Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (APSPDCL), who
is the lead procurer from Krishnapatnam Project has issued termination notice to
Coastal Andhra Power Limited (CAPL) CAPL had approached the High Court of Delhi
The Delhi High Court has dismissed the petition of CAPL on 2nd July,CAPL has
approached Division Bench, Delhi High Court as well as Indian Arbitrator Council
for arbitration The matter is subjudice For Tilaiya UMPP, the developer
(Jharkhand Integrated Power Ltd,  subsidiary of RPL) has issued notice of
termination of Power Purchase Agreement on 28th April,2015 citing non transfer
of land to the developer by the Jharkhand Government Procurers have accepted the
termination notice in November,2015 and after transfer of SPV (Special Purpose
Vehicle), necessary development activities for re-bidding would be started as
per revised standard bidding documents(SBDs) Four more UMPPs (Bedabahal in
Odisha, Cheyyur in Tamil Nadu, Kakwara in Bihar, Husainabad in Jharkhand) have
been identified for bidding process In addition, five other UMPPs, one in Uttar
Pradesh, two additional UMPPs in Orissa, second UMPP in Gujarat and second UMPP
in Tamil Nadu are in various stages of planning The selection/investigation of
sites for the above mentioned additional UMPPs are in process of consultation
with the concerned State Governments Broad status of UMPPs is placed at Annexure
Allocation of Captive Coal Blocks/Mines The coal production in the country had
not been keeping pace with the increasing demand of the power sector due to
various reasons, major one being delay in development of coal mines in the
country This had necessitated the need to import coal Therefore, it has been
decided to allocate coal blocks to project developers for captive use All UMPPs
at pithead have been allocated coal blocks The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in
its judgment dated 25th August,2014 and Order dated 24th September,2014 had
declared allocations of 204 Coal Blocks out of 218 Coal Blocks made since 1993
as illegal In compliance to the above Supreme Court Order dated 24th
September,2014,  coal mines in power sector for the linked end use power plant
have INTRODUCTION  Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan been
allotted through -Auction to the winning bidders (Developers) In addition to
above, 38 coal mines for linked end use power plant have also been allotted

handholding States for speeding up development of Smart Grid Network in the
country  Creation of National Electricity Fund (NEF) for Distribution Scheme
Investment in Sub-transmission and distribution has been lacking due to resource
crunch being experienced by the State transmission and distribution utilities
The break-up of the generation and transmission & distribution schemes shall
normally be 50:However, more investment is taking place in generation and
investment in intra-state transmission system and distribution system has been
much less than the desired proportion Government of India has approved the NEF
(Interest Subsidy) scheme to promote the capital investment in the distribution
sector by providing interest subsidy, linked with reform measures, on the loans
taken by public and private power utilities for various capital works under
distribution projects This scheme shall be applicable in the entire country and
all distribution projects shall be considered The works covered under RGGVY &
-APDRP projects shall not be eligible so as to ensure non-duplication and non-
overlapping of grant/subsidy towards investment 10 Energy Efficiency Government
of India has undertaken  two pronged approach to cater to the energy demand of
its citizens while ensuring minimum growth in CO2 emissions, so that the global
emissions do not lead to an irreversible damage to the earth INTRODUCTION 14
Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan system On one hand, the
Government is promoting greater use of renewables in the energy mix mainly
through solar and wind and at the same time shifting towards supercritical
technologies for coal based power plants On the other hand, efforts are being
made to efficiently use the energy in the demand side through various innovative
policy measures under the overall ambit of Energy Conservation Act, Ministry of
Power, through Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), has initiated  number of
energy efficiency initiatives in the areas of household lighting, commercial
buildings, standards and labelling of appliances, demand side management in
agriculture/municipalities, SME' and large industries including the initiation
of the process for development of energy consumption norms for industrial sub
sectors, capacity building of State Designated Agency (SDA), etc These
initiatives have resulted in an avoided capacity generation of 36,323 MW during
the period  The National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency The National
Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) is one of the eight missions
under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) NMEEE aims to
strengthen the market for energy efficiency by creating conducive regulatory and
policy regime and has envisaged fostering innovative and sustainable business
models to the energy efficiency sector The NMEEE spelt out four initiatives to
enhance energy efficiency in energy intensive industries which are as follows: )
Perform, Achieve and Trade Scheme (PAT),  regulatory instrument to reduce
specific energy consumption in energy intensive industries, with an associated
market based mechanism to enhance the cost effectiveness through certification
of excess energy saving which can be traded ) Market Transformation for Energy
Efficiency (MTEE), for accelerating the shift to energy efficient appliances in
designated sectors through innovative measures to make the products more
affordable ) Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP), for creation of
mechanisms that would help finance Demand Side Management(DSM) programmes in all
sectors by capturing future energy savings ) Framework for Energy Efficient
Economic Development (FEEED), for development of fiscal instruments to promote
energy efficiency The Mission seeks to upscale the efforts to unlock the market
for energy efficiency which is estimated to be around ₹ 74,000 crores and help
achieve total avoided capacity addition of 19,598 MW, fuel savings of around 23
million tonnes per year and greenhouse gas emission reductions of 55 million
tonnes per year at its full implementation stage Continuation of NMEEE was
approved by Cabinet on 6th August, 2014 with  total outlay of ₹ 775 crores 12
Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme
(DELP) was launched by Government of India, replacing the Bachat Lamp Yojana
(BLY) The scheme provides LED bulbs at  subsidized rate for replacing
incandescent lamps or Compact Fluorescent Lamps(CFL) to households More than
crore LED bulbs were distributed in  registering  150 times growth against
lakhs in 2013-Procurement price of LED bulbs reduced from ₹310 for    bulb in
January 2014 to ₹ 00 for    bulb in the last bidding carried out in As on 2017
26,37,24,970 LED bulbs have been distributed 13 Human Resource Development –
Adopt an ITI Scheme Power industry is highly capital intensive industry where
human element is the most vital input The power sector provides wide range of
opportunities across different levels of skill and aptitude Power industry
requires technically trained manpower for various roles such as project
planning, implementation, erection, commissioning, testing, & for generation
transmission and distribution of power, which includes renewable energy sector
and manufacturing segment Due to the technology intensive nature of the
business, technical and managerial competency is crucial in ensuring timely
implementation of projects and optimum performance upon commissioning The labour
intensity of energy production,  the labour required per unit of energy
produced, is much higher in renewable energy sources than in conventional energy
production primarily due to the distributed nature of the projects These
distributed renewable sources of power not only provide clean, green and
sustainable form of energy but also INTRODUCTION 15 Central Electricity
Authority National Electricity Plan have enormous potential to generate
employment in the rural communities Small hydro, solar and biomass based energy
can go  long way in powering rural communities Government of India has set
target for renewable capacity of 175 GW by 2022, it is important to ensure that
the manpower be trained and equipped in these emerging areas Driven by the
imperative to mitigate climate change, there is an increasing focus on renewable
energy, energy efficiency, conservation measures so as to reduce carbon
footprint from the power sector This inter-alia, includes implementation of
energy efficient systems, monitoring & auditing Other key focus areas include
loss reduction in distribution utilities and improving Demand Side Management
(DSM) Monitoring systems for detecting losses as well as DSM techniques require
usage of advanced IT and communication systems which call for  large number of
personnel to be trained in these specialised areas With the emergence of
competitive markets and power trading systems,  large number of highly skilled
professionals with commercial and technical knowledge are required in this area
Other key decision makers and managers also need to develop  good understanding
of the trading systems in order to make commercial decisions With the increase
in the stakeholders in the industry, the role of regulators is also very
important Training of regulators at regular intervals is an important issue that
would promote institutional capability and provide the regulators with the
necessary skill sets Apart from the regulators, the respective State Governments
should also initiate steps to provide training to the staff of regulatory
commissions since it has been observed that the in-house capacity of most of the
inadequate regulatory commissions is 14 Scheme for Utilisation of Gas Based
Capacity Government of India has sanctioned  scheme for utilization of gas based
power generation capacity for the years 2015- 16 and 2016-The scheme envisages
supply of imported spot Re-gasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) to the stranded

ADDITION To follow low carbon growth strategy, Government of India is promoting
supercritical technology for coal based power plants, which has higher
efficiency than conventional sub critical technology, thereby ensuring less CO2
emissions Table  shows that around 35,230 MW (42%) of the total capacity
addition from coal units (84,850 MW) are based on supercritical technology
(660MW and above) during the 12th Plan period It is observed that 36 no of coal

Issues in timely availability of startup power at site Issues in timely
completion of power evacuation system and capacity of transmission system to
evacuate full power generated at the plant Shortage of Natural Gas • • • • Cost
overruns on account of delay in timely completion of power projects • Issues in
availability of adequate finances from banks and financial institutions for
completion of projects leading to cost overruns/increased cost of the plant Poor
performance of main contractor and sub-vendors including BoP sub-vendors for
various reasons/issues involved • • Contractual disputes resulting in
termination of contract and re-tendering etc resulting in project delays and
cost overrun • Natural calamities and extreme weather conditions including heavy
rains, cyclones etc, specifically in coastal areas • Non signing of long term
PPA with DISCOMs and non-fulfillment of PPA conditions by the project developers
In some cases, even no PPA is available for sale of power from the power plant •

11 CONCLUSIONS In the 12th Plan, the target of capacity addition from
conventional sources was 88,537 MW However, the capacity addition achieved from
conventional sources during 12th Plan period is 99,MW which is about 112% of the
target  REVIEW OF CAPACITY ADDITION DURING 12TH FIVE YEAR PLAN 13 Central
Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan  As envisaged in Electricity
Act, 2003, private players have started playing dominant role in capacity
addition in power sector, with 55 % of total capacity addition from conventional
sources during 12th Plan There has been considerable slippage in the Hydro and
Nuclear capacity addition envisaged in the 12th Plan The factors affecting
capacity addition in Hydro and Nuclear sectors need to be addressed urgently to
arrest the further decline in the generation mix   Capacity addition from
supercritical technology based coal power plants have contributed around 42% of
the total capacity addition from coal based plants commissioned during 12th Plan

Plan CHAPTER  DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT, ENERGY EFFICIENCY & CONSERVATION
BACKGROUND Demand-Side Management (DSM) is applied to energy efficiency measures
that would modify or reduce end-user’ energy demand It is basically the
selection, planning, and implementation of measures intended to have an
influence on the demand either caused directly or indirectly by the utility’
programs DSM has been traditionally considered as  means of reducing peak
electricity demand In the short term, DSM program facilitates reduction in
energy cost as well as the need for adding new distribution networks, thereby
enhancing reliability for utilities and in the long term, can help to limit the
need for utilities to build new power plants, and transmission lines As
customer strategy, DSM programs encourage the installation and use of end-use
technologies that consume less energy, thereby reducing the customers’ overall
electric bill Energy Efficient technologies also have higher efficiency
operating characteristics, they tend to last longer and thus reducing the
operation and maintenance cost This is especially true for programs that
encourage the use of high efficiency heating, cooling, and ventilation equipment
(HVAC), energy efficient lighting, fans and motors For some utilities, DSM
programs can help them reduce their peak/costly power purchases from the
wholesale market thereby lowering their overall cost of operations Reduced or
shifted energy usage can directly translate into less air pollution, less carbon
emissions, and thereby reducing the potential environmental threats associated
with global warming  ENERGY CONSERVATION ACT AND FORMATION OF BUREAU OF ENERGY
EFFICIENCY Considering vast energy saving potential and in order to bring
movement in energy conservation and energy efficiency in different end-uses in
the country, the Government of India enacted the Energy Conservation (EC)Act,
2001 for providing sustainable and more efficient management of our energy
resources The Act came into force in March, The broad objectives of   Act, 2001
are: ) Promote faster adoption of energy efficiency and conservation through
regulation, participation and cost-effective measures Involve States and other
stakeholders in the energy efficiency initiatives ) ) Create  sustainable
environment for demand of energy efficient products, technologies and
professionals It is universally acknowledged that the business case for Energy
Efficiency is compelling, good return on investment, reduction of input cost,
delinking economic growth and energy dependency It also yields significant co-
benefits, which include economic growth and job creation Despite such apparently
straightforward advantages, the rate of adoption of Energy Efficiency (EE)
historically lagged behind the opportunities To address the adoption bottleneck
through regulatory and promotional activities, Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE)
was created in 2002 with the mission to “assist in developing policies and
strategies with  thrust on self-regulation and market principles, within the
overall framework of the   Act, 2001 with the primary objective of reducing
energy intensity of the Indian economy”  ASSESSMENT OF ENERGY EFFICENCY MEASURES
AND ACHIEVEMENTS TILL 12TH PLAN India’ energy intensity in 2001 was 175 kgoe/₹
(kg of oil equivalent/₹) and it came down to 0131 kgoe/₹ in This is equivalent
to  saving of about 258 mtoe (Million tonnes of oil equivalent) of Total Primary
Energy Supply (TPES) during this period based on  year-to-year basis estimation
The year-to-year energy saving (in TPES term) has seen an increasing trend
during 2001 to 2013 which have been mainly due to couple of factors   
Structural shift in economic activities, product & energy mix etc Energy
Efficiency initiatives In 2010, BEE under the aegis of Ministry of Power, was
also entrusted with the task of implementing the National Mission for Enhanced
Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) The various Energy Efficiency initiatives taken by BEE
under the four major intervention areas are given in Table  DEMAND SIDE
MANAGEMENT  Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan Table
Energy Efficiency Initiatives by BEE Regulatory Market Transformation 
Promotion of energy efficiency in Agriculture and Municipality sectors to reduce
peak demand: Identification of options in AgDSM, MuDSM and SME programs 
Mandatory Standards and Labelling (&) for selective appliances and equipment 
Energy Conservation Building  Formulate and Promote EE and new technologies:
CFL, LED, Waste Heat Code (ECBC) Recovery, Tri-generation etc  Energy usage
norms for large industries through Perform- Achieve-Trade (PAT) scheme 
Certification Energy of Efficiency professionals (Energy Auditors and Energy
Managers)  Promote and facilitate usage of energy efficient appliances: Public
Procurement  Market transformation of large industries in adopting EE
technologies: Energy Saving certificates in PAT scheme  Capacity Building of
DISCOMs for implementation of DSM measures  Create awareness and disseminate
information on energy efficiency and conservation: Consumer awareness program 
Fuel efficiency norms for  Promote use of CFLs through innovative financing
Bachat Lamp Yojana passenger cars through CDM route  Mandatory Energy Audit of
 Promote use of LEDs through innovative financing  Domestic Efficient large
industries level Lighting Program  State regulations buildings &  Promote
Super-Efficient Appliance Deployment (SEAD) in colour TVs by international
recognition: SEAD program under Clean Energy Ministerial (appliances, industry
sector)  International co-operation Fiscal Measures  Creation of Partial Risk
Guarantee Fund (PRGF) and Venture Capital Fund (VCF)  Creation of State Energy
Conservation Funds (SECF) Financial Incentives  Formulate and facilitate
implementation of pilot projects and demonstration projects: AgDSM, WHR projects
in States, LED street lighting, LED village campaign  Enhancement of laboratory
facilities for testing of energy efficient appliances: Laboratory capacity
building program  Provision of incentives to manufactures in Super-Efficient
Equipment Program (SEEP) The cumulative energy consumption of the country was
7715 mtoe during  at the user-ends It is estimated that 215mtoe ( % of the total
consumption) energy was saved due to energy efficiency measures from the year
2001 to Out of this, about 23% savings is due to direct result of BEE’
interventions The overall energy saving due to BEE’ schemes/programs is about
1mtoe during 2001-As per BEE calculations, an avoided capacity of 36,323MW
during the years 2006 to 2014 has been achieved The National Energy Conservation
Award (NECA) scheme which was launched by Ministry of Power in 1999 has also
resulted energy savings in participating industries The total energy consumption
and energy savings due to energy efficiency measures are shown in Exhibit

that the saving realization due to BEE schemes has been appreciable after 2007
when many schemes were operationalized In terms of avoided capacity, BEE has
always exceeded the yearly targets assigned to it by Central Government Although
the scheme wise targeted saving has not been achieved by all schemes, the
overall saving has been remarkable It is found that BEE schemes have the maximum
direct impact on residential sector as 77% of the savings are result of
Standards & Labelling program which mainly covers household appliances However,
BEE efforts have led to much bigger impact on account of customers taking
voluntary initiatives due to increased awareness  Achievements of demand
reduction by Energy Efficiency measure It is observed that the benefits reported
by BEE, have been mainly concentrated in one or two schemes  appliance and
industry programs (as shown in Table ) Therefore, there is lot of scope in other

Medium Enterprises (SMEs) The SME sector is an important constituent of the
Indian economy, contributing significantly in GDP, manufacturing output and
export Similarly, this sector also plays  significant role in energy consumption
which is about 25% of the total energy consumption by industrial sector BEE is
targeting the SME sector for reduction in energy consumption by % of the energy
used in the energy intensive manufacturing SMEs which is equivalent to 75 mtoe
Due to demand DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT  Central Electricity Authority National
Electricity Plan side management activities, demand from SME will be reduced and
their profit margins will increase and will lead to better management in the

utilization of solar water heaters can reduce consumption of conventional energy
being used for heating water in homes, industries and commercial & institutional
establishments Solar water heaters of  litres capacity are suited for domestic
applications and larger capacity heating systems can be used for restaurants,
guest-houses, hotels, hospitals, industries etc  solar heating system of 2m2
area can replace electric geyser of  kW load MNRE has informed the projections
of installation of SWHS having total area of 800,000 m2 /year in the country
during  to 2020-These SWHS would have the potential to reduce the annual peak
load of the country by 800 MW  Institutional Mechanism: Strengthening of State
Designated Agencies (SDA) It is well recognized that State Designated Agencies
(SDAs) in different States need to play  very important role in terms of
carrying forward various energy efficiency initiatives at the State level The
thrust of the SDA program is based on strengthening the 35 SDAs which would
enable them to implement various EE and EC programs and activities initiated by
BEE or SDAs themselves The activities include sector specific interventions in
areas like municipality (drinking water and sewage treatment), agriculture
sector (pumping), street lighting, commercial buildings, Government buildings
and waste heat recovery in SMEs including demonstration projects Following
initiatives of SDAs are proposed to be supported that would help in
strengthening the capacities of SDAs and undertaking of various projects and
programmes to promote energy efficiency in their respective States: () (ii)
Continued engagement of SDAs with energy efficiency professionals like energy
auditors, energy managers Support for implementing State-wise sector specific
energy saving plan by the SDAs and ESCOs DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT  Central
Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan (iii) Implement various EE
demonstration projects in the States to showcase the effectiveness of the most
advanced energy efficient technology and pursue State Governments to replicate
the project in other parts of the States (iv) LED village campaign in the
villages and pursue State Governments to replicate the project in other parts of
the States () Providing technical support to the SDAs (vi) Publicity /awareness
on EE in the States (vii) Workshops/ training programmes for all the
stakeholders (viii) Capacity building programmes for the SDAs  Regulatory
Instruments  ToD (Time of Day) Metering / ToU (Time of Use) Pricing ToD/ToU
metering is  billing method in which depending on the expected load on the grid,
billing day is divided into several time zones The duration of each time zone is
programmable and the user can define the time zones as per his requirements The
meter records the energy consumed in different time zones in separate registers
and exhibits accordingly Consumption in each of the time zone is charged at
different rates The tariff rates for different time zones are fixed in such  way
that  consumer pays more for energy used during peak hours than for off‐peak
hours It becomes the responsibility of the consumer to either restrict his
energy usage or pay accordingly This encourages consumers to shift load during
cheaper time periods of the day TOD metering helps consumers to manage their
consumption which in turn helps the utility in managing the peak demand TOD
metering helps in shifting the loads mostly to off- peak hours, resulting in
reduction in the peak demand requirement of the utilities by flattening their
load curve It would also improve the financial health of the utilities as the
utilities would not have to buy costly power during peak hours Hence, TOD
Metering system is very useful for utilizing the available electrical energy in
an optimum way This also helps the utilities to plan their distribution
infrastructure appropriately This can be implemented in all consumer categories
be it domestic, commercial, industrial or even BPL consumers Presently, most of
the States have implemented this type of metering for industrial and commercial
consumers However, it is very difficult to assess the reduction in Peak Demand
achieved through the use of TOD metering unless specific inputs are received
from the States in this regard  Demand Response (DR) Ability to reduce
electricity demand from appliance to manage peak demand would reduce the need
for costly investments in energy supply, manage shortages, and improve the
reliability of the electricity grid DR primarily takes the form of: ()
involuntary load shedding by utilities, and () time of use pricing More nuanced
equipment based auto DR can be used to avoid blanket load shedding in the short
run and avoid investment in expensive peak plants in the long run Demand
Response (DR) can, therefore, be considered  valuable resource for managing the
electricity grid It can effectively mitigate peak demand and also reduce the
costs associated with integrating intermittent renewable electricity generation
Reduction in AT& losses: To address the issues related to the high AT& losses
and reforms in the distribution sector of the States, the Government of India
launched Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme (APDRP) for 10th
Plan and Restructured Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme
(-APDRP) for 11thPlan In the 11th Plan, the scheme has been restructured with
emphasis on actual demonstrable performance in terms of sustained loss reduction
The programme was of ₹ 51,577 crores Ministry of Power has further sanctioned
“Integrated Power Development Scheme” (IPDS) in December, 2014 with the
following components: () (ii) Metering of distribution
transformer/feeders/consumers in the urban areas Strengthening of sub-
transmission and distribution networks in the urban areas DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT
Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan (iii) IT enablement of
distribution sector and strengthening of distribution network, for completion of
the targets laid down under -APDRP for 12th and 13th Plans by carrying forward
the approved outlay for -APDRP to IPDS The components at () and (ii) above have
an estimated outlay of ₹ 32,612 crores, including  budgetary support of ₹ 25,354
crores from Government of India during the entire implementation period The
scheme of -APDRP as approved by Govt for continuation in 12th and 13th Plans has
been subsumed in this scheme as  separate component relating to IT enablement of
distribution sector and strengthening of distribution network [component (iii)
above] for which Govt has already approved the scheme cost of ₹ 44,011 crores
including  budgetary support of ₹ 22,727 crores This outlay will be carried
forward to the new scheme of IPDS in addition to the outlay indicated above
(Source: MoP order No 26//2014-APDRP dated - 2014) Ministry of Power has also
laid down  State-wise AT& loss reduction trajectory till the year  to be
followed by various States across the country  Affordable Energy Efficient
Lighting Solution () The Lighting Industry has seen  strong growth of more than
67% from ₹ 8500 Crores in 2010 to ₹ 16200 Crores in This has been driven largely
from Incandescent Lamps (GLS) to Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) and recently
with Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) Several Government initiatives have supported
this transition, including Government regulations and directives to use CFL in
Government buildings, and large installations Government being largest buyer of
lighting products, impacts the industry business by various actions Recent
initiatives by Government to promote and procure LED Lighting products, has
suddenly changed the scenario for which the lighting industry was not prepared
The chart below gives  fair idea of total population of Light points in domestic
sector, Street Light population in year 2005, possible growth by 2020 and likely
business available that needs to be tapped in India Table  *Street Light sale
between  will be around 41 million (ii) Initiatives by Government to Promote LED
Lighting in India Making BIS standards mandatory, establishment of Energy
Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), making star labelling for LED Lamps by BEE
and later for LED down lights and launching Demand side management schemes to
promote LED lamps are the initiatives that the Government has taken to push use
of LED Lighting in all segments Under Electronic System Design & Manufacturing,
DeitY has initiated several schemes to provide relief and funding for land,
equipment and tax holiday etc, to promote electronic manufacturing in India
including LED Lighting DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT 10 Central Electricity Authority
National Electricity Plan  ACHIEVEMENTS AND PLANS WITH RESPECT TO MISSIONS OF
CLIMATE CHANGE The National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) is one
of the eight missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)
NMEEE aims to strengthen the market for energy efficiency by creating conducive
regulatory and policy regime and has envisaged fostering innovative and
sustainable business models for the energy efficiency sector The NMEEE spelt out
four initiatives to enhance energy efficiency in energy intensive industries
which are as follows:  Perform, Achieve and Trade Scheme (PAT),  regulatory
instrument to reduce specific energy consumption in energy intensive industries,
with an associated market based mechanism to enhance the cost effectiveness
through certification of excess energy saving which can be traded  Market
Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE), for accelerating the shift to
energy efficient appliances in designated sectors through innovative measures to
make the products more affordable  Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP),
for creation of mechanisms that would help finance demand side management
programmes in all sectors by capturing future energy savings  Framework for
Energy Efficient Economic Development (FEEED), for development of fiscal
instruments to promote energy efficiency The Mission seeks to upscale the
efforts to unlock the market for energy efficiency which is estimated to be
around ₹ 74,000 crore and help achieve total avoided capacity addition of 19,598
MW, fuel savings of around 23 million tonnes per year and greenhouse gas
emissions reductions of 55 million tonnes per year at its full implementation
stage Continuation of NMEEE was approved by Cabinet on 6th August, 2014 with
total outlay of ₹ 775 crores  Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) On 30th March,
2012 energy saving targets for 478 designated consumers belonging to  sectors
were notified In the first cycle of PAT (ending in year ), 478 industrial units
in  sectors (Aluminium, Cement, Chlor- Alkali, Fertilizer, Iron & Steel, Paper &
Pulp, Thermal Power, Textile) have been mandated to reduce their specific energy
consumption (SEC)  energy used per unit of production by March,Overall, the SEC
reduction targets aim to secure 05% reduction in the SEC in these industries
totalling an energy saving of 686 million tonne of oil equivalent which would
account for mitigation of about 24 million tons of CO2 Sector Specific proforma
along with Sector Specific Normalization Factors to streamline the monitoring
and verification (&) process has been prepared The sector/ sub-sector specific
Normalization Factors were developed to neutralize the effects on specific
energy consumption (SEC) in the assessment year as well as baseline year so that
undue advantages or disadvantages could not be imposed on any Discoms while
assessing the targets To facilitate the & process, & guidelines for all the
sectors have been developed BEE has put in place  process of accreditation of
Energy Auditors who will be engaged to execute the & process of DCs to assess
their performances Development of Energy Saving Certificates (EScerts) trading
infrastructure is in process in collaboration with Central Electricity
Regulatory Commission (CERC) Documents on “Pro-forma and Normalization Equation”
and “Normalization Document and Monitoring and Verification Guidelines” have
been prepared to facilitate the effective implementation of the scheme and
copies of same have been provided to all Designated Consumers, Accredited Energy

Accredited Energy Auditing Firms Currently scrutiny of performance assessment
documents (PADs) is under process by State Designated Agencies (SDAs) and by
Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) After the scrutiny by BEE and on the
recommendation of BEE, the Central Government will issue ESCerts which can be
traded at Power Exchanges When compared to the baseline energy consumption at
the beginning of PAT scheme, the energy efficiency measures have resulted in
savings of around % till Table  Specific Energy Consumption (ToE /MT) 2017

energy savings are targeted to reach 10% through widening of PAT scheme to new
sectors as well as increasing the penetration within the current sectors In
addition, guidelines for mandatory disclosures on energy consumption by
companies, under the Companies Act will help in achieving the 10% targets As per
Guidelines on Energy and Energy Conservation Reporting in Annual Reports of
companies, all firms, registered under the Companies Act, are mandated to
disclose their annual energy consumption and energy conservation initiatives
through the company’ annual report With the appropriate guidelines in place, the
scope and nature of data provided, including energy and energy conservation
data, will be more streamlined and robust This will also encourage companies to
undertake energy audits, identify energy intensive areas within the firm as well
as formulate energy efficiency measures to improve energy savings Outreach
activities to consult with designated consumers and technology providers
including knowledge exchange platform to share experiences within and between
sectors  Market Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE) Under MTEE, two
programmes have been developed  Bachat Lamp Yojana (BLY) and Super-Efficient
Equipment Programme (SEEP) ) Bachat Lamp Yojana (BLY): It is  public-private
partnership program comprising of BEE, Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) and
private investors to accelerate market transformation in energy efficient
lighting Under this program, over 29 million incandescent bulbs have been
replaced by CFLs In the next phase of BLY, BEE will promote use of LED lights
using the institutional structure of BLY Programme BEE provides support to Rural
Electrification Corporation (REC) for framing technical specification and
monitoring and verification of the energy savings from the LED bulbs distributed
under RGVVY scheme to BPL households BEE will also undertake outreach activities
to promote large scale adoption of LEDs (ii) Domestic Efficient Lighting
Programme (DELP): Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) has evolved  service
model where it works with electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs) through
benefit sharing approach DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT 12 Central Electricity Authority
National Electricity Plan The Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme (DELP)
obviates the need for DISCOMs to invest in the upfront cost of LED bulbs; EESL
procures the LEDs bulbs and provides to consumers at  rate of ₹ 10 each as
against their market price of ₹ 350-) DELP scheme -Key features: DELP will
leverage the Demand Side Management (DSM) regulatory framework that SERCs have
created to set up  robust payment security mechanism EESL, on its own or in
collaboration with partners, will undertake project implementation and take the
investment risk The methodology has been uniquely developed with strong focus on
the monitoring and verification aspects Following are some of the key features
of DELP • Distribution of LEDs to households at cost of ₹ 10 as against  market
price of ₹ 350 to 600 • At least three years’ free replacement warrantee • No
impact on tariff • Payment to EESL from DISCOM spread over  years from energy
savings achieved • Benefits sharing approach The upfront investment made by EESL
is paid back in two different ways as indicated under as case studies: Table

to enable Municipalities to replace conventional lights with LEDs at no upfront
cost The balance cost is recovered through the municipalities by monetising the
energy savings Case Study -Vizag Street Light Project EESL has implemented about
92,000 street light retrofit projects in Vizag This project will reduce the
energy consumption by 50% The entire upfront capital of ₹ 64 crores has been
invested by EESL and will be recovered over   years’ period The municipality
will pay EESL  sum of ₹ crore every year whereas its overall costs savings would
be ₹ 31 crores annually This service model is replicable as it obviates the need
for upfront capital as well as reduces the recurring expenditure of
municipalities This model could help scale up energy efficient street light

transformation for super-efficient appliances by providing financial stimulus
innovatively at critical point/ of intervention Under this program, ceiling fan
has been identified as the first appliance to be adopted SEEP for ceiling fans
aims to leapfrog to an efficiency level which will be about 50% more efficient
than market average by providing  time bound incentive to fan manufacturers to
manufacture super-efficient (SE) fans and sell the same at  discounted price The
goal is to support the introduction and deployment of super-efficient 35W
ceiling fans, as against the current average ceiling fan sold in Indian market
with about 70W rating For the 12th Plan, it is targeted for deployment of
million fans during the Plan period with an outlay of ₹ 100 crores Under this
program, maximum of ₹ 500 per fan incentive will be given to fan manufactures
for manufacture and sale of fans meeting SEEP specifications Consultations with
main stakeholders of the program such as fan manufactures technology providers,
& institutions, academia and civil society organizations have been completed
Main technical specifications have been finalized Assessment of testing capacity
and development of testing protocols have been completed Independent agency for

efforts of the Government for creation of energy efficiency market Under FEEED,
BEE has constituted two funds namely Partial Risk Guarantee Fund for Energy
Efficiency (PRGFEE) and Venture Capital Fund for Energy Efficiency (VCFEE)
PRGFEE is  risk sharing mechanism to provide financial institutions
(banks/NBFCs) with  partial coverage of risk involved in extending loans for
energy efficiency projects Under PRGFEE, the support has been provided to
Government buildings, private buildings (commercial or multi-story residential
buildings), municipalities, SMEs and industries The guarantee will not exceed ₹
crores (has been proposed to increase to ₹ 15 crores) per project or 50% of loan
amount, whichever is less BEE has constituted the Supervisory Committee for
PRGFEE and selected the consortium of RECPDCL-REC-EESL as the Implementing
Agency for PRGFEE, which is in process of operationalizing the fund The
notification of PRGFEE rules is also under process DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT 14
Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan VCFEE is  fund to
provide equity capital for energy efficiency projects  single investment by the
fund shall not exceed ₹  crores The Fund shall provide last mile equity support
to specific energy efficiency projects, limited to  maximum of 15% of total
equity required, through Special Purpose Vehicles or ₹  crores, whichever is
less The support has been provided to only Government buildings, private

Other initiatives of Government for enhancing energy efficiency in Generation
sector ) Adoption of super-critical technology in thermal generation
Supercritical units are designed with higher steam parameters of 247kg/cm2, 565
° With the higher steam parameters of supercritical units, the efficiency of
these supercritical units would be about -% higher than the efficiency of
present 500 MW sub-critical units This would lead to corresponding savings in
coal consumption and reduction in GHG emissions The thermal units in the country
so far have largest size unit capacity of 800 MW 60 Nos supercritical units of
sizes 660 MW with  total capacity of 41,310 MW have been commissioned In the
period , coal based capacity addition was mainly through supercritical units
Coal fired thermal generation units based on Ultra-super-critical technology
having steam pressure of  kg/cm2 and temperature of 600° are also being
introduced in the country The national average thermal efficiency of
coal/lignite based power plants has increased from 53% in  to about 34% in
2013-It is expected that the efficiency of coal based generation would further
improve in the period  due to commissioning of large size super critical units
ii) Automatic transfer of LOA/Coal Linkage in case of Scrapping old thermal
units Min of Coal, Government of India has formulated  policy on automatic
transfer of LOA/coal linkage (granted to old plants) to new plants in case of
scrapping of old units and replacing them with new higher efficiency super-
critical units (Illustration: for setting up of new supercritical plant of 1000
MW capacity, at least 500 MW of old capacity has to go be retired Old plants can
be clubbed together to achieve this) The additional coal required shall be
accorded priority in allocation subject to availability on best efforts basis
from CIL iii) Retirement of old & in-efficient thermal units The retirement of
old and inefficient units of thermal generating stations and replacing them with
new and more efficient units is one of the major initiatives taken by Government
of India The identified units are to be retired in  phased manner along with the
matching capacity addition in the respective State, so as to have no impact of
retirement on the power supply position in the States/country  capacity of 2398
MW has been retired in 11th Plan period In 12th Plan, capacity of ,082 MW was
retired iv) Renovation and Modernization (&) & Life Extension (LE) of existing
old power stations With an objective of improving efficiency and availability of
old units, & and LE works of total capacity of 16,146 MW have been completed in
11th Plan period In 12th Plan & and LE works for total capacity ,26 MW was
completed ) & for Advance Ultra Supercritical technology Under the National
Mission for development of clean coal technologies, an & project has been taken
up to indigenously develop Advance Ultra Supercritical (-USC) technology with
steam temperature of around 700 0C Typically an -USC power plant having steam
parameters of 300 kg/cm2 pressure and 700° steam temperature may have plant
efficiencies of around 46% (HHV higher heat value basis) NTPC, Indira Gandhi
Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR) and BHEL have signed  MOU for development of
the - USC technology It is proposed to execute an 800 MW -USC indigenous
demonstration plant (with main steam pressure of around 300 kg/ cm2 and
temperature of 700 0C) in  -year period from the date of financial sanction by
the DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT 15 Central Electricity Authority National Electricity
Plan Govt of India The -year period comprises of two and half years of design
and development work (& phase) and four and half years of power project
construction phase  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS  Regulators to notify their
DSM regulations and direct the DISCOMs to prepare their DSM action Plans
Regulators may direct Distribution Companies to take up energy efficiency
measures in their areas The DISCOMs may be suitably incentivized to implement
DSM projects like lighting, air-conditioning, agricultural pumps, refrigerators
and ceiling fans etc for reduction in their peak demand  Encourage
implementation of ToD Tariffs for industries and commercial consumers in phased
manner and include domestic consumers subsequently  DISCOMs may be advised to
carry out annual audits of energy flow of their distribution system  Retirement
of old and inefficient units and replacing them with more efficient
supercritical units  Joint Committee may be constituted under chairmanship of
Secretary (Power) with official from BEE, CEA, EESL, SERC, DISCOMs and other
stakeholders to monitor and recommend improvements in DSM measure DEMAND SIDE

Electricity Plan CHAPTER  DEMAND PROJECTIONS  INTRODUCTION Demand assessment is
an essential prerequisite for planning of generation capacity addition and
commensurate transmission and distribution system required to meet the future
electricity requirement of various sectors of the economy The type and location
of power plants is largely dependent on the magnitude, spatial distribution as
well as the variation of electricity demand during the day, seasons and on
yearly basis Reliable planning of capacity addition for future is largely
dependent on accurate assessment of future electricity demand  DEMAND ASSESSMENT
BY CENTRAL ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY- ELECTRIC POWER SURVEY COMMITTEE Electricity
demand of the country is periodically assessed by the Electric Power Survey
Committee (EPSC), taking into account the actual electricity demand incident on
the system in the past years, planned and under implementation policies and
programmes of the Government, various developmental activities projected in
future, impact of energy conservation measures, etc The last exercise to assess
the demand was the 18th Electric Power Survey (EPS) and the report of 18th EPS
was brought out in December, The 18th EPS Report covered year-wise electricity
demand for States/ UTs, Regions and for the country till the year  and
perspective electricity demand for the years  and 2031- The 19th Electric Power
Survey Committee (EPSC) was constituted by CEA in June, The terms of reference
of the Committee were as under:  To forecast the year- wise electricity demand
for each State/ UT, Region and for the country for the years  to 2026-ii To
project the perspective electricity demand for each State/ UT, Region and for
the country the year  and 2036-The Electric Power Survey Committee had wide
representation from the stake holders in the power sector with representatives
from Niti Aayog, Ministry of Power, Bureau of Energy Efficiency, NTPC, NHPC,
REC, BBMB, State Transmission Companies, State Distribution companies,
Electricity Departments, TERI, FICCI, CII, NCAER, etc The 19th EPS report has
been brought out in January, METHODOLOGY ADOPTED Partial End Use Method (PEUM)
has been adopted to project electricity demand for 19th EPS Partial End Use
Method is  “bottom-up” approach focusing on end-uses or final energy needs of
different categories of consumers like domestic, commercial, irrigation,
industries, railway traction, etc Various initiatives of Government of
India/State Governments like Power for All (PFA), DSM, energy conservation and
efficiency improvement measures, Make in India, etc have been broadly factored
in the electricity demand projection  Data for Carrying Out Electricity Demand
Projection For carrying out electricity demand projection, the annual
electricity data covering category-wise consumption of electrical energy,
category-wise connected electric load, & losses, mid-year population, number of
consumers, number of energized irrigation pump sets, aggregate capacity of
irrigation pump sets, etc from the year  had been furnished by the
Discoms/Utilities/ Electricity Departments of the States / UTs Additional
information such as programme of reduction in & losses, electrification of un-
electrified households, irrigation pump sets energisation programme, details of
lift irrigation schemes, LT & HT public water works, bulk power supply etc were
also provided by the Discoms/Utilities/ Electricity Departments of the States /
Union Territories Some of the states indicated that the DEMAND PROJECTION
Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan tariff structure for
various categories of consumption adopted by their State() is different from
categories included in the EPS and therefore they have clubbed these under the
broad categories while furnishing information to CEA State/UT wise annual
statements of power supply position brought out by CEA indicating actual
electrical energy requirement and availability, peak electricity demand and peak
met and the inter-regional and all-India diversity factors were also studied and
considered for the demand projection State/UT wise data of electricity demand
for railway traction was provided by Ministry of Railways/Railway Board based on
their programme of railway track electrification and expansion plans Year-wise
electricity demand projection has been carried out for the years  to  with the
year  being taken as the base year Perspective electricity demand projection has
been done for the years  and 2036- The medium/long term projection of
electricity demand has been done for 66 Discoms, 36 States/UT’,  Regions and for
the country Since some distribution licensees (eg KESCO, JUSCO etc) did not
furnish the data separately, they have been considered as point load by the main
Distribution Licensee  POLICY INITIATIVES OF GOVERNMENT AFFECTING ELECTRICITY
DEMAND  Reduction of AT& losses Programmes for reduction of AT& losses like
Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY), IPDS, DDUGJY etc are under implementation
by the Government The target is to reduce AT& losses to about 13 % by the year
on all-India basis Reduction of AT& losses would lead to reduction in
electricity demand The losses for Discoms have been taken as per the trajectory
of loss reduction given by the respective Discoms  DSM, Energy Conservation &
Efficiency improvement programs Ministry of Power, Government of India and the
State Governments have introduced various programmes for vigorous Demand Side
Management (DSM), improvement of energy efficiency and energy conservation
measures like & (Standards & Labelling), Perform-Achieve-Trade (PAT) scheme in
industries, Energy Efficient Lighting solutions, Super-Efficient Equipment
Programme etc There would be reduction in electrical energy requirement and peak
electricity demand through implementation of these programs These initiatives
have been factored in the electricity demand projection exercise  Power for All
(PFA) Initiative Government of India had taken  joint initiative with respective
State Governments/UT’ for preparation of State/UT specific documents for
providing 24X7 Power to all households/homes, industrial and commercial
consumers and adequate supply of power to agricultural consumers as per their
policy This initiative aims at ensuring uninterrupted supply of quality power to
existing consumers and providing access to electricity to all un-connected
consumers by 2019 in  phased manner This initiative would result in higher
growth of electrical energy requirement in the initial years of the forecast
period  Dedicated Freight Corridor Electricity demand on account of dedicated
freight corridor has been factored in the electricity demand of Railways as per
information provided by Ministry of Railways/Railway Board based on their
programme of railway track electrification and expansion plans  Make in India
Make in India is an initiative launched by the Government of India to encourage
multi-national, as well as national companies to manufacture their products in
India This initiative would lead to growth in electricity demand The state
utilities/Discoms were requested to include the electricity demand due to this
programme in their demand projections  Electric Vehicles As per the National
Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2012 of Department of Heavy Industries,
Government of India, the DEMAND PROJECTION  Central Electricity Authority
National Electricity Plan number of electric vehicles in India is likely to be
millions by the year 2020 ( million two wheelers &  million four wheelers) The
electric vehicles are likely to charge their batteries during day time  during
periods of high solar power, when thermal power stations would be running at
part load and during off-peak hours in the night after getting back home This
therefore would not lead to any increase in the peak electricity demand  Roof
top solar programme India has set its renewable energy capacity addition targets
to 175 GW by 2022 in view of the significant Renewable Energy potential in the
country This includes 100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from biomass and
GW from small hydro power The 100 GW of solar includes 40 GW from solar rooftop
Some of the electricity demand will be met locally through these rooftop solar
installations, leading to less requirement from the grid The likely impact on
electricity demand due to implementation of various initiatives,
policies/programmes of Government of India and the States has been suitably
incorporated in the electricity demand projection The State Authorities have
indicated that data submitted to CEA for the 19th EPS Exercise have been arrived
at by considering the impact of such policies/programmes on the electricity
demand of respective Discoms/States/UTs  OVERVIEW OF ELECTRICITY DEMAND

be met from captive power plants  CAPTIVE POWER PLANTS (CPP) Large number of
captive power plants including co-generation power plants of varied type and
sizes exist in the country which is either utilized in process industry or for
in-house consumption Some plants are also installed as standby units for
operation only during emergencies when the grid supply is not available Captive
power plants including co- generation power plants, therefore play
supplementary role in meeting the country’ electricity demand  Installed
Capacity and Electricity Generation from Captive Power Plants Captive plants
over the years have been evolved from plants owned by single promoter to group
captive to the medium of maximizing the benefit by selling its surplus power The

electricity consumed by industries from captive power plants is transferred to
the utility grid in the years  and  respectively, it is estimated that
additional electrical energy of about 41 BU in the year  and 97 BU in the year
would be required by industries from the utility grid However, since the
electricity tariff for industrial and commercial consumers are high at present
as these are cross- subsidizing small consumers, it may be cheaper for
industrial and commercial consumers to take power from their own captive power
plants Indeed, there has been increasing interest to set up or take equity in
captive power plants, signifying  shift away from grid supply Therefore, the
above is not considered as  likely scenario in electricity demand projections
CONCLUSIONS The electrical energy requirement and peak electricity demand on
all-India basis has been taken as per the 19th EPS Report to work out the
generation capacity addition requirement The EPS exercise involves all
stakeholders and an extensive exercise has been done Distribution company wise

Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan CHAPTER  GENERATION PLANNING
INTRODUCTION Electricity is one of the key enablers for achieving socio-economic
development of the country Amongst various modes adopted for meeting the ever
increasing demand of power to achieve the targeted growth rate, Generation
capacity augmentation is the most vital component The economic growth leads to
growth in demand of power To meet this demand, in view of the limited available
fuel resources for generation, capacity addition has to be planned very
optimally During the 12th Plan (),  capacity addition of 99,209 MW was
commissioned against target of 88,537 MW from conventional sources It is for the
first time in the history of the Indian power sector that such  large capacity
addition during  single plan period was achieved which is 112 % of the target
During 11th plan the achievement in capacity addition was 84% of the target This
chapter highlights the Principles and Methodology of Generation Planning adopted
to assess the capacity addition required from conventional energy sources by the
end of year  and 2026-Capacity addition target from non- conventional energy
resources has also been considered  OPTIONS FOR POWER GENERATION IN INDIA Coal
is the major source for power generation in our country and since Low Carbon
Growth Strategy has to be followed, other generation options need to be
harnessed in the most optimum manner Fuel Options available for Power Generation
are:  Conventional Sources – Coal and lignite, Hydro, Nuclear, Natural gas 
Non-Conventional Renewable Energy Sources- Solar, Wind, Biomass, small hydro,
tidal, Geothermal, Waste to energy, Hydrogen/ fuel cells, etc  GENERATION FROM
CONVENTIONAL SOURCES IN INDIA  Hydro Total Hydro Electric Power potential in the
country was assessed as 84,044 MW (at 60% load factor) from  total of 845 number
of identified Hydro Electric Schemes, which when fully developed would result in
an installed capacity of about ,48,701 MW on the basis of probable average load
factor The total energy potential is assessed as 600 billion units per year
Hydropower is used to its maximum potential for meeting peak loads and all new
projects must be designed with this objective in mind However, the full
development of India’ hydro-electric potential, while technically feasible,
faces various issues including issues of water rights, resettlement of project
affected people and environmental concerns etc and all these issues need to be
resolved to exploit full potential As on 2017, the installed capacity of
hydroelectric power plants in the country was 44,478 MW which is % of the total
installed capacity of the country  Nuclear Presently, Nuclear Power Corporation
India Limited is operating 21 reactors with an installed capacity of ,680 MW Out
of these 21 reactors, presently 13 reactors with an installed capacity of ,280
MW are under IAEA Safeguards and use imported fuel Remaining  reactors with an
installed capacity of ,400 MW use indigenous fuel In addition to above,  100 MW
PHWR RAPP  is under long term shutdown since As on 2017, the installed capacity
of Nuclear power plants in the country was ,780 MW which is % of the total
installed capacity of the country  Gas Addition of gas based capacity is
considered necessary to reduce CO2 emissions and to utilise their capability to
fast ramp-up and ramp-down The advantage of fast ramping capability becomes more
important in view of large scale GENERATION PLANNING  Central Electricity
Authority National Electricity Plan integration of renewable energy Modern
combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) have high efficiency of around 55% as
compared to coal based plants (Gross efficiency of supercritical units is about
40%) Gas turbines/Engines could be located near the load centre with  view to
minimize the requirement of transmission system and could be operated in  manner
so as to maximize the output during the peak hours and minimize during the off-
peak hours However, the production and supply of gas had not been keeping pace
with the growing demand of natural gas in the country, including power sector
The gas supply for gas based power stations in the country is inadequate and the
country is facing huge generation loss Presently, existing gas based power
plants are operating at very low PLF of about 23% and few gas based power plants
are lying idle due to non-availability of domestic natural gas As on 2017, the
installed capacity of gas based power stations was 26,167 MW (including liquid
based) which is  % of the total installed capacity of the country  Coal/Lignite
Coal based power generation is backbone of Indian Power sector and will continue
to dominate power generation in the country Due to environmental concerns, clean
coal technologies such as supercritical technology has been adopted Capacity
totalling to about 35,230 MW based on Super critical technology has been
commissioned during 12th plan Lignite is available at limited locations such as
Neyveli in Tamil Nadu, Surat, Akrimota in Gujarat and Barsingsar, Palana,
Bithnok in Rajasthan Since, lignite is available at  relatively shallow depth
and is non-transferable, its use for power generation at pithead stations is
found to be attractive The coal based installed capacity was ,92,88 MW as on
2017 which was almost % of the total installed capacity of the country
GENERATION FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES The installed capacity from renewable
energy sources was 57,244 MW as on Share of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in
the total installed capacity was about % However, the share of renewables will
substantially increase in coming years due to major thrust given by Government
of India in promoting Renewable energy sources on account of these sources being
clean and green energy India is one of the best recipient of solar energy due to
its location in the solar belt and has vast solar potential of 749 GW for power
generation Also, India has substantial wind potential of 103 GW due to its long
coastline Based on the availability of biomass, the potential of power
generation from bio mass has been assessed as around 25 GW Small hydro of
capacity up to 25 MW has  power generation potential of around 20 GW However,
generation from renewable energy sources especially solar and wind is variable
in nature and therefore, requires huge balancing capacity in the system
PRINCIPLES OF GENERATION PLANNING The major aspects considered in planning
process are:    To achieve sustainable development Power Generation Capacity
to meet the demand pattern To fulfil desired operational characteristics of the
system (to meet varying demand) such as reliability and flexibility  Most
efficient use of resource  adoption of latest technological advancements in coal
based generation, etc   Fuel availability Integration of Non Dispatchable
Renewable Energy Sources The above aspects have been considered within realms of
feasibility, while drawing up this National Electricity Plan along with the
economics and the status of the various projects GENERATION PLANNING  Central
Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan  Sustainable Development The
importance and relevance of power development within the confines of Clean and
Green Power is the most essential element Such  development depends upon the
choice of an appropriate fuel / technology for power generation Accordingly, the
Plan takes into account the development of Hydro projects and projects based on
renewable energy sources as well as other measures and technologies promoting
sustainable development in the country  Operational Flexibility and Reliability
Generating units utilising different fuels have different operational
characteristics The fuel sources and their respective technologies of power
generation are multiple and varied The demand of our electric system varies with
time of the day, season, year and the spatial location Therefore, matching the
generation with demand at all instances of time requires not only installation
of adequate capacity but also to be sensitive to the type of generation
capacity, each with its unique characteristics of altering its output and the
time taken to do so Accordingly, this requirement of the system also needs to be
considered when deciding upon the type of generation It is, therefore, necessary
to widen the scope of the planning process to take into account aspects of
‘reliability’ and ‘quality’ of power, apart from the adequacy and quantum of
power  Reliability of Power Reliable power system operation requires constant
balancing of supply and demand in accordance with established operating criteria
such as maintaining system voltages and frequency within acceptable limits
Changes in customer demand and generation from renewable energy sources
throughout the day and over the seasons are met by controlling generation from
conventional sources when needed To achieve reliability in the system, adequate
reserve capacity, spinning as well as non-spinning, needs to be planned in the
system Aspects related to the operation, ownership, modalities and nature of
reserves also need to be determined The National Electricity Policy,2005
stipulates creation of spinning reserve of % in our system This has been
considered while planning capacity addition requirement during the years  and
2022- Flexibility of operation  system that is designed for base-load generation
may lack the characteristics to respond dynamically or efficiently to the
variation in demand within  short time Apart from variation in demand, there is
expected to be wide variability in generation from renewable energy plants Since
system stability requires matching of generation with the demand at any instance
of time,  certain degree of flexibility in terms of ability of the generators to
respond rapidly to the changing demand and generation from renewable energy
sources must be introduced into the system through appropriate power generating
plants and financial mechanism System should also be able to meet additional
demand which arises due to unexpected demand fluctuations and sudden outages of
some generating units  Efficient Use of Resources The fossil fuels for power
generation are scarce and must therefore be used most judiciously From the point
of view of environment also, it is essential that energy produced per kcal of
fuel is maximum to the extent possible This would minimize the pollution caused
during the process of power production  PLANNING TOOLS - DETAILS OF PLANNING
MODELS Generation expansion studies have been carried out in CEA using the
computer software model “Electric Generation Expansion Analysis System” (EGEAS)
Salient features of the Planning model are discussed below The Electric
Generation Expansion Analysis System (EGEAS) is  software package for expansion
planning of an electric generation system In this planning model the operation
of the power system is simulated probabilistically The load on the power system
is represented both in terms of magnitude and time variation The model yields
the reliability indices, namely the Loss-Of-Load-Probability (LOLP), the
expected value of Energy-Not-Served (ENS), and the reserve margin for an
expansion power plan by minimizing the objective function which is the present
worth of ) the GENERATION PLANNING  Central Electricity Authority National
Electricity Plan costs associated with operation of the existing and committed
generating stations ) the annualized/ levelised capital cost and operating cost
of new generating stations and ) cost of energy not served The EGEAS model is
capable of giving  number of expansion plans along with their objective
functions and the reliability indices for such plans The optimal power plan is
that plan for which the reliability indices are satisfied in accordance with
criteria laid down by the planner, and the objective function is the lowest The
EGEAS model, being essentially deterministic in nature, provides for long range
generation expansion planning as it yields very useful quantitative measures of
reliability of power supply several years into the future, and at the same time
gives an indication of the total cost of operating the existing and committed
generating stations and installing and operating the new generating stations
Block Diagram showing various data flows is shown in Exhibit  Exhibit
Subsequently, the study results were validated using another generation
expansion planning model namely ORDENA  The ORDENA model has following
capabilities: - • The model performs Generation Expansion Planning, Production
Costing and also has the capability of modeling renewable energy sources through
generation expansion planning • The model optimizes transportation of fuel,
transmission of power and emissions from power plants while addressing system
reliability issues like Loss of Load Probability(LOLP) and Energy Not
Served(ENS) The software also does hour-by-hour simulation while recognizing the
constraints of dispatch on generation imposed by the transmission system • The
model has the capability of carrying out All-India studies as well as studies
for each State/UT considering import/export of power from one state to another
state GENERATION PLANNING  Central Electricity Authority National Electricity
Plan  PLANNING APPROACH Planning approach has been to meet the peak demand and
energy requirements In view of generation being delicensed and high capacity
addition programme from Renewable Energy sources, it becomes imperative to plan
for more optimal mix of base-load capacities, peaking capacity and reserve
capacities The base load capacities will take care of ‘bulk- power’ requirement,
while the others will provide the system operator with sufficient reserve
capacity and  valuable tool to take care of intermittency of renewable
generation, seasonal spikes or time-of-day variations – expected and unexpected
in electricity demand The dynamic response characteristics of such  balanced
system would be far superior and would contribute to higher reliability As
unscheduled intra and inter-regional transfers would pose challenges and
therefore  right mix of base load and flexible generating units must preferably
be determined and planned for, at the level of the State grid itself This will
ensure the most rapid, real-time response to local peaking needs and variation
in generation from RES The Planning Approach followed is in the following
sequence:  All India Peak Demand and Energy requirement forecast Generation
expansion planning studies have been carried out based on the Electricity demand
assessed by the 19th Electric Power Survey (EPS) Report The estimated peak
demand (MW) and Energy requirement (BU) in the years  and  are given in Table

The demand data was collected for past three years (,  and ) on hourly basis
(8760 hrs) from various Regional Load Dispatch Centres The hourly data was
analysed and corrected for any discrepancies in terms of load shedding,
frequency correction, scheduled power cuts and any data errors Further, All
India Load profile for the year  and  was generated based on respective
projected Peak Demand and Energy Requirement In view of the massive capacity
addition programme from renewable energy sources (Solar and wind) during the
years from  to , the All India Net load curve was obtained from the All India
Load profile by treating generation from renewable energy sources as negative
load The methodology adopted for arriving at “All India Net load curve” is as
follows: ) Collection of latest available hourly generation profile data for
8760 hrs of existing solar and wind power projects of various States )
Estimating Hourly generation profile data for States where profile was not
available by taking inputs from various studies carried out by MNRE )
Normalising Hourly generation profile of Solar and Wind plants ) Scaling up the

requirement of this Reserve Capacity has been incorporated in the studies by
correspondingly reducing availability of conventional plants by % It has been
estimated that the likely installed capacity in  would be around 479 GW Of this,
RES will contribute around 175 GW Therefore, 304 GW may be the likely installed
capacity from the conventional sources of this,  15 GW, has been kept as reserve

Studies The All India Net load curve has been used to carry out generation
expansion studies by EGEAS Software The estimated energy generation and
contribution towards Peak Demand from RES (Solar + Wind) has been reduced from
projected Energy requirement and Peak Demand figures as only net load is
required to be met through conventional energy sources Hydro and Nuclear
projects were accorded priority and considered as must run projects on account
of their inherent advantages However, due to non-availability of natural gas,
gas based power plants have been restricted to lower PLF The studies result in
the capacity addition requirement of coal based projects to meet the projected
Energy requirement and Peak demand considering given reliability criteria
Retirement of old thermal units Information was compiled in respect of old
thermal power plants which have already retired and plants likely to be
considered for retirement in future 71,023 In the base case scenario,  coal
based capacity of 22,716 MW (,927 MW + 16,789 MW) is considered for retirement
during 2017-This is based upon the assessment made by CEA which consists of ,927
MW of capacity assuming that the normal trend of past retirement process would
continue along with  coal based capacity of 16,789 MW which doesn’ have space
for installation of FGD (Flu Gas Desulphurization) system to curb SOx emissions

NORMS ADOPTED FOR RELIABILITY CRITERIA The Power System is planned to meet the
forecasted demand while ensuring an expected level of reliability Reliability is
measure of the ability of  system to perform its designated function under the
designed conditions In our Studies, Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) is the
criteria adopted to reflect the capacity of the system to meet the peak load and
Energy Not Served (ENS) to reflect the Energy Requirement not met in the System
LOLP is the probability that  system will fail to meet its peak load under the
specified operating conditions It is the proportion of days per year or hours
per year when the available generating capacity is insufficient to serve the
peak demand This index is dimensionless and can also be expressed as  percentage
ENS is the expected amount of energy which the system will be unable to supply
to the consumers as  fraction of the total energy requirement This index again
is dimensionless and can also be expressed as  percentage In other words, this
indicate as to how many units of energy requirement in  year are not met and
correspondingly how many hours in  year the power demand is not met Various
countries in the world have adopted their own Reliability Criteria depending
upon the status of their power system and the price affordability of the
consumers to pay for the reliability of the system It is evident that  more
stringent and reliable system would yield higher cost of electricity which has
to be borne by the consumer Details of LOLP adopted in some countries are as
given in Table  Table  LOLP of some countries Name of country Cambodia Laos

PLANNING NORMS The planning studies require accurate performance parameters of
various types of generating units to assess their availability and energy
generation capabilities The peaking availability and energy generation capacity
are important parameters for meeting the projected demand of the country
including various regions The key performance factors required for the planning
studies are the auxiliary power consumption, heat rate, capital cost of the
generating units, fuel cost, gross calorific value, & schedules, etc Different
types of generating units have varied operational performance and accordingly
different norms have been used for thermal (coal and lignite), combined cycle
gas projects, hydro and nuclear projects The generation planning norms for
different sizes of thermal units are different Accordingly, separate categories
based on unit sizes have been derived Many higher size units of 660 MW and 800
MW have been commissioned and have been treated as separate groups Combined
Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) are very efficient and have lower heat rates, however,
their availability and PLF depend on the availability of natural gas The energy

with Projected Capacity Addition in Previous NEP In the previous NEP, the
tentative capacity addition requirement during the period  was projected as
86,400 MW (however target set for 12th plan was 88,537 MW) based on the
projected Peak demand and Energy requirement as per 18th Electric Power Survey
(EPS) Report The projected Peak Demand and Energy requirement in the year
GENERATION PLANNING 17 Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan
was ,83,470 MW and 1904 BU respectively as per the 18th EPS Report However, the
Peak Demand and Energy Requirement during  as projected by 19th EPS report is
,25,571 MW and 1566 BU respectively Also,  capacity of 99,209 MW has been
commissioned against  target of 88,537 MW during 12th plan () Therefore, during
12th plan, capacity addition to the extent of 10,672 MW has been commissioned in
excess of 12th Plan target In addition, Government of India has announced huge
capacity addition programme from Renewable Energy sources so as to have
installed capacity of ,75,000 MW from RES by the end of year 2021-All these
factors have contributed to the reduction in capacity addition requirement
during the period  ALTERNATE SCENARIOS FOR CAPACITY ADDITION Generation
expansion planning is  major part of any power system planning studies and is
normally carried out for the next -10 years These studies are performed based on
various assumptions and factors prevalent at that time However, there are
various uncertainties associated with the input data such as demand forecasts,
availability of fuel, investment, committed units, retirement plans, input fuel
prices, availability of technology, various initiatives of Government like
promotion of energy efficiency, etc As  result, generation expansion planning is
essentially stochastic in nature Forecasting electricity demand is most
challenging and consequently,  very vital parameter for generation expansion
planning There are numerous ways to forecast electricity demand based on the
assumptions made Estimation of electricity demand for  developing country like
India is much more challenging than that of  developed country In  developed
country, because of the matured stage of development, the growth is considered
to be steady and therefore, it is relatively easy to forecast electricity demand
However, in  developing country, there may not be  definite trajectory of growth
as it is dependent on the economic performance, Government policies & programmes
and their extent of successful implementation thereof, etc Based on methodology
adopted (Chapter ) in estimating electricity demand in future years considering
DSM measures, the electricity energy requirement for the year  has been
estimated as 1566 BU with  Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 18% with
reference to 2016-However, due to uncertainties associated with demand
forecasting, one additional scenario has been considered in the Generation
planning studies  CAGR of 18 % as shown in Exhibit  below: CAGR: 18%: CAGR: 18%:

Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan An alternate scenario has been
constructed based on variation in projected energy demand to get  clear picture
of the effect of variation of Energy Demand on the requirement of additional
capacity Results of Alternate scenario () The generation planning studies for
the period  has also been carried out for the demand CAGR of 18% and keeping
other parameters unchanged as the base case, the coal based capacity addition
and their expected Plant Load factor % are shown in the Tables 17() and () below
Table 17() Demand CAGR from  to  (%) Year Peak(GW) Energy(BUs)  18 237 1641 With
the committed capacity addition, retirement, etc (as given in Table 14()), the
addition coal based capacity required by  to meet the peak demand and energy
demand would be as follows: Table 17() Capacity Addition Required During
Additional coal based Capacity required Year Remarks Since 47,855 MW are under
different stages of construction and are likely to materialise during , so no
additional capacity is required  19,700 Table 17() Energy Generated from coal

stations as % has been assumed to arrive at gross generation It may be seen that
in this case also no additional coal based capacity addition is required apart
from the under construction coal projects likely to benefit during the years  to
meet the peak and energy demand Analysis of Results () ) With committed capacity
addition of Hydro ,823 MW, Gas 406 MW, Nuclear ,300 MW, RES ,17,756 MW and
considering  retirement of coal based capacity of 22,716 MW with demand CAGR of
18% during 2017- 22, only ,445 MW coal based capacity would be required for the
said period, whereas coal based capacity of 47,855 MW is at various stages of
construction and is likely to be commissioned during  GENERATION PLANNING 19
Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan ) In the alternate
scenarios with demand CAGR of 18%, keeping the capacity addition from RES and
Hydro, Retirement of units constant, it is observed that coal based capacity
addition of 19,700 MW may be required during 2017-However, 47,855 MW of coal
based plants are in different stages of construction and would yield benefit
during 2017-With this capacity addition the energy demand and peak demand for
would be fully met ) The PLF of the thermal plants would be influenced to the
extent of achievement of capacity addition from RES, Hydro, etc and retirement
of units ) Significant quantum of capacity retirement would have  corresponding
significant positive impact on the PLF of the thermal plants Analysis of Results
() ) It may be seen that capacity addition to the tune of 46,420 MW will be
required under the given set of parameters This will be in addition to the
47,855 MW of coal based capacity which would likely benefit during 2017-) The
excess coal based capacity available by March, 2022 would help to meet the
increase in demand during  resulting better utilisation of plants ) The
additional capacity required for  should be preferably from flexible sources of
generation to meet the peaking, balancing and ramping requirements of the grid )
However, if this additional capacity comes from the coal based plants, the PLF
of coal based power stations will be in the range of % by 2026-) If the
additional capacity comes from other flexible sources, the PLF of the coal based
plants would further increase 12 CONCLUSIONS  The Electricity demand
projections considered for planning the capacity addition requirement, are as
follows: Year Energy Requirement ( BU) Peak Demand (MW) ,566 ,047 751 774
These values are in accordance with the Report of 19th Electric Power Survey
Committee Considering the demand projections for the year  as per the 19th EPS,
committed capacity addition from Gas 406 MW, Hydro ,823 MW, Nuclear ,300 MW, RES
,17,756 MW and likely retirement of 22,716 MW of coal based capacity during ,
the study result reveals that coal based capacity addition of ,445 MW is
required during the period 2017-However,  total capacity of 47,855 MW coal based
power projects are currently under different stages of construction and are
likely to yield benefits during the period 2017-Thereby, the total capacity
addition during  is likely to be ,76,140 MW   In view of the prevailing
shortage of natural gas in the country, no additional gas based power plant has
been planned during , except the plants which are presently ready for
commissioning /under construction However, in case availability of natural gas
improves, preference may be given to gas based power plants owing to their
advantage in efficiently helping in balancing the Grid and reducing emissions 
Considering the demand projections for the year  as per the 19th EPS, coal based
capacity addition of 47,855 MW already under construction for benefits during ,
committed capacity addition of Nuclear GENERATION PLANNING 20 Central
Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan ,800 MW, Hydro 12,000 MW, RES
,00,000 MW and likely retirement of 25,572 MW of coal based capacity during ,
study results reveals that capacity addition of 46,420 MW is required during the
period 2022-This capacity addition required during  as shown in the results is
in fact the peaking capacity requirement to be met in the grid This capacity
requirement can be met from any conventional source of energy  It is estimated
that Generation from RES will contribute almost % of the energy requirement in
the year 2021- Net Imports from neighbouring countries will increase from ,356
MW in the year  to 21,600 MW in the year 2026- The actual CAGR of energy demand
between the years  to  is 42% However, the CAGR of energy demand between  and
has been estimated as 18% This is substantially higher that of the immediate
past keeping in view secular increase in demand and increase due to
implementation of PFA and other Government of India programs between the years
2017- It has been assumed that Gas Power Plants will operate at minimum load as
carried out presently during the off- peak hours and ramp up during the time of
peaking requirement in the grid This operation amounts to their combined PLF of
around 37% The gas requirement may decrease provided two shift operation during
the day becomes feasible for Gas power stations  Energy demand of 1566 BU and
Peak Demand of 226 GW in March 2022 with CAGR of 18% look realistic and most
likely to occur Even with Energy Demand of 1641 BU and Peak Demand of 237 GW in
March 2022 with CAGR of 18%, sufficient capacity would be available to meet the
demand  Even with the incidence of higher demand by  like shifting of Captive
load to the grid, there would be adequate capacity to take care of this increase
in demand  Any negative deviation with respect of capacity addition target from
RES, Hydro, etc would have positive impact on the PLF of the coal-based plants 
Similarly, any positive deviation of projected demand in future would have
positive impact on the PLF of the coal based plants  Even retirement to the
extent of 22,716 MW during  due to strict implementation of environmental norms,
would not likely pose any problem in meeting the demand during 2021- It is
envisaged that the rate of capacity addition particularly from coal based
stations may outpace the rate of increase in demand during the period from
2017-The PLF of the coal based stations is likely to come down to around % by
with the normal retirement of unit, likely demand with CAGR of 18% and 175 GW of
capacity from RES Any deviation of the above independent variable would have an
impact on the PLF of the coal based stations as already mentioned above  During
the period of , the PLF of the thermal plants shall progressively increase and
would be hovering around % by 2026- For any capacity addition from conventional
sources in future, capability of flexibility of generation should be insisted
upon  The Hydro Power can also contribute significantly to meet balancing
requirement of the grid but is constrained due to vagaries associated with
seasonal inflows to the reservoir Also, the hydro capacity will constitute
around % of the total Installed Capacity in The peaking requirement to be met
from Gas may also reduce if the Government’ policy push for Hydro Power

RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES  INTRODUCTION The World Energy Forum has predicted that
fossil-based oil, coal and gas reserves will be exhausted in less than another
10 decades This coupled with the urgent need of arresting the adverse climatic
changes has forced planners and policy makers to look for alternate sources The
2015 United Nation Climate Conference in Paris is  milestone in global climatic
co-operation It reaffirmed the need to have  rapid and global transition to
renewable energy technologies to achieve sustainable development and avoid
catastrophic climatic change 195 countries adopted the first universal, legally
binding global climate deal In fact, many of the countries throughout the world
have already embraced renewable energy technologies significantly in order to
meet their electricity demand and reduce emissions  GLOBAL SCENERIO OF
ELECTRICITY GENERATION FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES The International Energy
Agency’ World Energy Outlook projects  growth of renewable energy supply from
,700 GW in 2014 to ,550 GW in 2040 on  global basis Global renewable generation
capacity at the end of 2015 stood at ,985 GW 152 GW renewable generation
capacity was added in The growth in renewable capacity addition during 2015 was
% Share of Asia in renewable capacity addition in 2015 was 58% (Source: IRENA)
In 2015, California received over 20% of its electricity from renewable energy
(excluding large hydro) By 2020, California’ Renewable Portfolio Standard Policy
requires  33% share of renewables In October 2015, the Government of Argentina
passed  new law to raise the share of renewables to 20% by 2025, and this
includes  number of new measures to realize this target Germany is  global
leader in adopting high share of renewable energy Renewables already provide
close to 30% of Germany’ power on an average basis On some peak days in 2014,
solar and wind alone supplied close to 80% of peak power demand at specific
times of the day Germany is targeting  50% share of renewables by 2030 and 80%
by 2050 and planned to phase out nuclear power by Denmark is  world leader in
wind power, with 39% of the country’ electricity coming from wind in Denmark is
targeting 50% of its electricity from wind power by 2020, and 100% of its
electricity from all forms of renewables by In December 2014, the Turkish
Government approved its National Renewable Energy Action Plan, targeting  30%
renewable energy share in power generation and 10% in transport by The European
Union (EU) as  whole had  27% renewable share in Among developing countries,
China, India, South Africa, and several other countries have already initiated
ambitious plans of capacity addition from Renewable Energy Sources(RES) China’
solar PV target for 2015 increased from GW to GW, which includes projects that
began construction in 2015 and will be commissioned by the end of June This
increase suggests that the 2020 target could be revised upward from 100 to 150
GW for solar PV and from 200 to 250 GW for wind, with strong interest and
engagement from provinces In October 2015, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) set  23% renewable energy target for primary energy to be
reached by In early 2015, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
released its region-specific renewable electricity target of terawatt-hours
(TWh), which would be 31% of total generation in In India, as on 31st
March,2017, the total RES capacity was 57,24 MW out of total installed
generation capacity of 326,MW This represents almost % of the total installed
capacity An Action Plan has been formulated by Government of India for
achievement of  total capacity of ,75,000 MW from Renewable Energy Sources by
March, RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES  Central Electricity Authority National
Electricity Plan  RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES Renewable energy sources are those
that are continually replenished by nature and derived directly from the sun
(such as thermal, photo-chemical, and photo-electric), indirectly from the sun
(such as wind, hydropower, and photosynthetic energy stored in biomass), or from
other natural movements and mechanism of the environment (such as geothermal and
tidal energy) This includes electricity and heat generated from solar, wind,
ocean, hydropower, biomass, geothermal resources and biofuels  description of
the dominant forms of Renewable Energy Sources is outlined below:-  Solar Power
Solar energy generation involves the use of the sun’ energy to provide hot water
via solar thermal system or electricity via solar photovoltaic (PV) and
concentrated solar power (CSP) systems These technologies are technically well
proven with numerous systems installed around the world over the last few
decades  Solar Photovoltaic Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems directly convert
solar energy into electricity The basic building block of  PV system is the PV
cell, which is  semiconductor device that converts solar energy into direct-
current electricity PV module is formed by interconnecting  large number of PV
cells The PV modules are combined with  set of application- dependent system
components to form  PV system Modular PV systems are linked together to provide
power ranging from  few watts to tens of megawatts The most established solar PV
technologies are silicon based systems More recently, thin film modules
consisting of non-silicon semiconductor materials have become important Thin
films generally have  lower efficiency than silicon modules However, price per
unit of capacity is lower in thin films Solar PV has the advantage of economies
of scale as module manufacturing can be done in large plants Further, in
addition to direct sunlight, it can use diffused sunlight which helps it to
produce power when sky is not clear Exhibit  shows global annual PV market till

Solar Power In Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology,  concentrated direct
beam solar irradiance is used to heat  liquid, solid or gas that is used in
downstream process for electricity generation Large scale CSP plants most
commonly concentrate sunlight by reflection, as opposed to refraction with
lenses Concentration is done on to  line (linear focus) as in central receiver

is produced through conversion of kinetic energy associated with wind to
mechanical energy first and then to electrical energy The amount of kinetic
energy in the wind that is theoretically available for extraction increases with
the cube of the wind speed However,  turbine only captures  fraction of that
available energy (40- 50%) In order to maximize energy capture, turbine designs,
including materials used for turbine, blade sizes etc, have been undergoing
changes The objective has been to minimize total cost of power produced from
wind turbine by capturing maximum wind energy and efficient conversion thereof
into reliable electrical energy Electrical conversion system is very important
as far as reliability is concerned For large grid-connected turbines, electrical
conversion system comes in different forms: ) Fixed Speed Induction Generators
ii) Variable Speed Machines The fixed speed induction generator wind turbines
are net consumers of reactive power that has to be supplied by the electric
network These turbines can provide real and reactive power as well as some fault
ride-through capability, all of which are required by electric network operators

energy is the use of living and recently dead biological material as an energy
source As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion
to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of bio fuel
Most of today' biomass power plants are direct-fired systems, which are similar
to most fossil-fuel fired power plants The renewable biomass fuels are converted
to heat and then to electricity Theoretically, it is  carbon neutral source of
energy The biomass used for electricity generation range from forest by-products
(wood residues), agricultural waste (sugar cane residue & rice husk) and animal
husbandry residues (poultry litter etc)  Small Hydro Power Small hydro power
plants utilize the flow of water to rotate the blades of the turbine which in
turn drives the generator for producing electrical energy The amount of energy
generated depends on the amount of water flowing through the turbine as well as
the size of the turbine Small hydro power plants are generally used as
standalone power systems in remote areas  Wave and Tidal Power Wave power, which
captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and tidal power, which converts the
energy of tides, are two forms of hydro power with future potential However,
they are not yet widely employed commercially  POTENTIAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY
GENERATION IN INDIA In order to arrest the climate change and in view of the
depleting conventional energy sources, India is taking firm steps towards the
development of renewable energy India has significant potential of electricity
generation from Renewable Energy Sources (RES) The Renewable Energy (RE)
potential in India is estimated at ,96,602 MW comprising of ,48,991 MW of Solar
Power, ,02,772 MW of Wind Power, 19,749 MW of Small Hydro Power and 25,090 MW of
Bio-Energy The State-wise estimated potential of renewable power in the country
is placed at Annexure- (Source: MNRE) The Government of India, in pursuit of
energy security and for minimizing impact on environment, has been prioritizing
the development of RE sector through its policies and programmes Wind, Solar and
Small Hydro are three emerging renewable energy sources Wind energy and solar
energy resources maps of India are shown in Exhibit  RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES
Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan Exhibit  (Source CWET,
Chennai) The description of dominant forms of the renewable energy sources in
India is outlined below:  Solar It has been observed that solar as viable
alternative for power generation among the available clean energy sources, has
the highest global warming mitigation potential India is one of the best
recipients of solar energy due to its favourable location in the solar belt (400
to 400 ) India has  vast potential for solar power generation since about 58% of
the total land area (89 million km2) receives annual average global insolation
above  kWh/m2/day The Gangetic plains (trans, middle and upper), plateau
(central, western and southern) region, western dry region, Gujarat plains and
hill region as well as the west coast plains and Ghat region receive annual
global insolation above  kWh/m2/day These zones include states of Karnataka,
Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu,
Haryana, Punjab, Kerala, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh The eastern part
of Ladakh region (Jammu & Kashmir) and minor parts of Himachal Pradesh,
Uttarakhand and Sikkim which are located in the Himalayan belt also receive
similar average global insolation annually The eastern Himalayan states of
Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Assam receive annual average global insolation
below  kWh/m2/day  Wind The development of wind power in India began in the 1986
with first windfarms being set up in coastal areas of Maharashtra (Ratnagiri),
Gujarat (Okha) and Tamil Nadu (Tuticorin) with 55 kW Vestas wind turbines The
capacity has significantly increased in the last few years Although  relative
newcomer to the wind industry, India has the fourth largest installed wind power
capacity in the world after China, USA and Germany The short gestation periods
for installing wind turbines, and the increasing reliability and performance of
wind energy machines has made wind power  favoured choice for electricity
generation in India The wind power projects in India are mainly spread across
south, west and north regions while east and north-east regions have no grid
connected wind power plant Wind power generation in India is highly influenced
by the monsoon in India The strong south-west monsoon, starts in May-June, when
cool, humid air moves towards the land and the weaker north-east monsoon, starts
in October, when cool dry air moves towards the ocean During the period of March
to August, the winds are uniform and strong over the whole Indian peninsula,
except the eastern peninsular coast Wind speed during the period of November to
March is relatively weak No offshore wind farm utilizing traditional fixed-
bottom wind turbine technology in shallow sea areas or floating wind turbine
technology in deep sea areas are under implementation An offshore wind policy
was announced in 2015 and RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES  Central Electricity
Authority National Electricity Plan presently weather stations and LIDARS( light

(NIWE) at some locations  Biomass About 32% of the total primary energy use in
the country is still derived from biomass and more than 70% of the country’
population depends upon it for its energy needs The current availability of
biomass in India is estimated at about 500 million metric tonnes per year,
covering agricultural and forestry residues corresponding to  potential of about
18,000 MW Additional ,000 MW power could be generated through bagasse based
cogeneration in the country  Small Hydro Hydro power plants of capacity up to 25
MW are categorized as small hydro power plants The estimated potential for power
generation in the country from such plants is about 20,000 MW Most of the
potential is in Himalayan States as river-based projects and in other States on
irrigation canals  DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLES IN INDIA There has been
significant increase in renewable energy capacity in the country during the last
decade The installed capacity of renewables in India was ,761 MW as at the end

Plan  RECENT RENEWABLE ENERGY INITIATIVES  Solar Parks Government of India has
chalked out the target of developing 100 GW of solar power plants by Solar parks
are basically clearly demarcated development zones with proper infrastructure
like roads and other amenities State Governments or EPC developers acquire the
land, put up transmission lines, get the required government permissions and
approvals, and offer the facility to the companies who can put up their solar
projects on the land and offer the operators  fee Thus, the risk associated with
the projects are greatly minimized The first solar park in the country was
established at Charanka solar park in Gujarat This was closely followed by the
Bhadla solar park in Rajasthan The concept of solar parks has given an impetus
for rapid development of solar power projects in the country 34 no of solar
parks in 21 States with an aggregate capacity of 20,000 MW have been approved
Large size projects have  potential to bring down the cost of solar power
Therefore, Ultra-Mega Solar power projects having capacity of 500 MW or above
have been proposed Large chunks of land are available in  few States for solar
park development  National Offshore Wind Energy Policy, 2015 Under the policy,
the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has been authorized as the nodal
Ministry for the use of offshore area within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
of the country and the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) has been
authorized as the nodal agency for development of offshore wind energy in the
country and to carry out the allocation of offshore wind energy blocks,
coordination and allied functions with related ministries and agencies It would
pave the way for offshore wind energy development including setting up of
offshore wind power projects and research and development activities, in waters,
in or adjacent to the country, up to the seaward distance of 200 nautical miles
(EEZ of the country) from the base line Preliminary assessments along the ,600
km long Indian coastline have indicated prospects of development of offshore
wind power With the introduction of the National Offshore Wind Energy Policy,
the Government is attempting to replicate the success of the onshore wind power
development in the area of offshore wind power development The scheme would be
applicable throughout the country depending upon the offshore wind potential
availability  Indian Wind and Solar Resources Atlas 2015 Wind Energy Resources
Map of India at 100 meter above ground level and Solar Radiation Map at ground
level on online Geographic Information System (GIS) platform has been launched
This online Wind Atlas is available online on the NIWE website  The Wind and
Solar Resource maps will not only help and guide the wind & solar power
developers and other stakeholders in identifying potential areas for the
development of wind & solar power projects in the country but also help the
central and state agencies in planning and developing the infrastructure
including transmission system, required for installing renewable power projects
in these potential areas  Solar Cities Under the programme of development of
Solar Cities, the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy(MNRE) has approved 56 solar
city projects, against the target of development of 60 nos of Solar Cities The
Solar Cities programme is designed to support/encourage urban local bodies to
prepare  road map to guide their cities in becoming renewable energy cities or
Solar Cities The ministry has already initiated various programmes in the urban
sector for promoting solar water heating systems in homes, hotels, hostels,
hospitals and industry; deployment of SPV systems/devices in urban areas for
demonstration and awareness creation; establishment of ‘Akshya Urja Shops’;
design of Solar Buildings and promoting urban and industrial waste/biomass to
energy projects The solar city programme aims to consolidate all the efforts of
the ministry in the urban sector and address the energy problem of the urban
areas in  holistic manner The Solar City programme aims to:  Enable and empower
urban local governments to address energy challenges at city-level  Provide
framework and support to prepare  Master Plan including assessment of current
energy situation, future demand and action plans  Build capacity in the urban
local bodies and create awareness among all sections of civil society  Involve
various stakeholders in the planning process RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES 11 Central

Government has implemented  scheme to install one lakh solar pumps for
irrigation and drinking water through state nodal agencies and NABARD These
pumps would help lakhs of farmers in increasing outputs, income and also in
providing drinking water According to estimates, drinking water problems will be
solved for more than  lakh families through solar pumps for drinking water MNRE
provides 30% capital subsidy to farmers for installation of solar pumps for
irrigation purpose through state nodal agencies The state governments can give
additional subsidy The Government presented 40% subsidy with mandatory loan to
farmers for irrigation purpose through NABARD The ministry has issued
supplementary guidelines for ,00,000 solar pumps during  and  sum of ₹ 50 crores
was released to various agencies for the purpose  Solar projects under National
Solar Mission Union Cabinet approved the implementation of scheme for setting up
of 15,000 MW of grid-connected solar PV power projects under the National Solar
Mission through NTPC/NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited (NVVNL) in the three
tranches namely, 3000 MW under tranche- under mechanism of bundling with
unallocated coal based thermal power and fixed levellised tariffs, ,000 MW under
tranche-II with support from government to be decided after getting some
experience while implementing tranche- and balance ,000 MW under tranche-III
without any financial support from the government Successful completion of
additional 15,000 MW capacity of grid-connected solar PV power generation
projects with largely private investment under the National Solar Mission would
accelerate the process of achieving grid tariff parity for solar power and would
also help in reducing consumption of kerosene and diesel, which is presently in
use to meet the unmet demand  GENERATION PROFILE OF SOLAR AND WIND Normally

HOURS However, the generation from an individual PV system may not be very
smooth Because of the cloud movement, the generation would be affected Cloud
movement is highly unpredictable This makes the output from  solar plant
uncertain Cloud cover can result in very rapid changes in the output of
individual PV systems The uncertainty associated with the output of  single PV
system can be smoothened out in two ways- ) aggregating  large no of PV systems
and ii) aggregating the output of different PV systems scattered at dispersed
geographic locations As the number of PV plants increases, their normalized,

INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES IN THE GRID The share of renewables in
the overall generation mix of the country is increasing steadily The Government
of India’ ambitious plan of having RES capacity of 175 GW by March, 2022 has
accelerated the capacity addition from Renewable Energy Sources(RES) The
capacity addition from RES has opened up opportunities as well as challenges
distinct difference exists between conventional generating plants and RES The
generation from the conventional plants can be programmed to vary as per the
requirement of loads That is why it is called dispatchable generation Generation
from Variable Renewable Energy Sources like wind and solar power depends on
nature and hence is called non-dispatchable Further variability and uncertainty
are the two aspects associated with generation from Variable Renewable Energy
(VRE) Variability refers to the variation of generation over  period of time For
example, generation from solar plants is expected to follow  fixed pattern like
maximum generation during noon time and “NIL” at night Similarly, generation
from wind follows seasonal pattern- maximum during monsoon RENEWABLE ENERGY
SOURCES 18 Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan Uncertainty
refers to the unpredictability of generation from VRE For example, generation
from solar plants are expected to be maximum during noon But due to cloud cover,
the generation may get affected This is the uncertainty part of solar generation
Furthermore, in conventional power plants, power generated from the plants are
transported through high voltage transmission links and then distributed to the
consumers through distribution networks In case of RES, the generating plants
are mostly connected at the distribution levels or at customers’ end There may
be bi- directional flow of electricity- from grid to customers and from
customers to the grid As the generation from VRE are variable and uncertain,
requisite balancing power from conventional sources and energy storage devices
is required to be made available as reserve to ensure that demand at any time is
fully met Another aspect that needs consideration is that the generation from
solar plants peaks when the demand during the day is low and has zero generation
in the evening when the load on the grid is maximum This requires fast ramping
up capabilities of conventional generators Therefore, integrating this VRE
sources into the existing grid offers  challenge The basic principle governing
the integration of VRE sources into the grid is to ensure the integrity,
security and reliability of the grid More than anything else, integration of VRE
into the grid poses technological and operational challenges Some of the
challenges that need to be addressed are discussed below: Flexibility Associated
with Conventional Generating Units To accommodate the variability and
uncertainty of generation from RES, the conventional generating plants must be
flexible The flexibility of generating station refers to its ability () to cycle
on and off including its lead time required; (ii) the ramping rate at which it
can vary the generation; and (iii) maximum and minimum output while it is in
operation The IEA provides  generic characterization of the differences between
flexible and inflexible plants Flexible coal plants offer ramping rates of
-%/minute, --hour start-up times, and minimum output limits of % (of maximum),
compared to inflexible plants with ramping rates of less than %/minute, --hour
start-up times and minimum output limits of % Flexible natural gas plants show
similar improvements, with minimum output limits of % compared to % for
inflexible plants  “fast-acting” gas turbine plants on the market today can
offer start-up times of just 40 minutes Flexible nuclear plants offer minimum
output limits of %, compared to 100% for inflexible plants In France, existing
nuclear plants can ramp down to 30%, with ramp rates of up to %/minute In terms
of flexibility, hydro plants, pumped storage plants, open cycle gas turbine, gas
engines etc are very suitable Coal plants are classified as constant output or
baseload plants and are rarely turned down or turned off frequently Essentially,
they are considered as inflexible These plants experience reduced efficiency,
more maintenance, lower equipment lifetime and reduced cost etc if subjected to
cycling or frequent ramp up and ramp down However, existing coal based plant can
be redesigned/retrofitted to enable quick start-ups and ramping In Denmark and
Germany, thermal stations are extensively used for cycling as well as ramping
Combined-cycle natural gas power plants normally run as baseload plants or
intermediary load plants While open cycle gas power plants are capable of
cycling and ramping, combined-cycle natural gas power plants are also flexible
to some extent and may be retrofitted to be more flexible These, however, will
lead to some loss of generation efficiency, high maintenance cost and higher
emissions Nuclear power plants are considered to be the most inflexible of
baseload plants But this plant can also be operated as  flexible plant, if
designed properly In Germany and France, nuclear plants offer flexibility in
operation In India, the nuclear plants are operated as base load plants, with
minimum variability from the point of consideration of safety and security Also,
with the rapid advancements in energy storage technology, in future if it
becomes economically viable, then it can also prove to be  vital resource for
providing balancing power Transmission Strengthening Solar and wind map of India
indicates that the potential of solar and wind power is concentrated mostly in
few solar and wind rich States In fact,  States in India accounts for more than
77% of the RE capacity addition by The RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES 19 Central
Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan solar and wind power generated
by these states may not be consumed fully by these states Power generated from
RES by these states needs to be transported to the load centers through
transmission networks This may require strengthening of existing grid networks
or alternately the use of storage devices In India, Green Energy Corridors for
evacuation of power from the regions having high concentration of RES is in the
process of implementation Advanced Forecasting Wind and solar power forecasting
can help reduce the uncertainty of variable renewable generation Better
forecasting helps grid operators to commit or de-commit generators in
accommodating changes in wind and solar generation more efficiently and prepare
for extreme events in which renewable generation is unusually high or low
Forecasts can help reduce the amount of fast response operating reserves needed
for the system, thereby reducing costs of balancing the system Internationally,
improvements have been made in recent years towards reducing mean average
forecast errors Day- ahead forecasts can be used to make day-ahead unit
commitment decisions This will drive operational efficiency and cost savings
Short-term forecasts can be used to determine the need for  quick-start
generator, demand response, or other mitigating options and thus drive
reliability Clouds are the primary cause of variability for solar generation,
aside from the predictable changes during the course of the day and throughout
the year The ability to accurately forecast solar power depends on the character
of cloud cover, including the amount of water or ice in clouds and aerosols To
assess near-term impacts of approaching clouds on solar generation, sky imagers
can be used To predict impacts during the next few hours, satellite images can
be used to assess the direction and speed of approaching clouds For longer
periods, weather models can be used to determine how clouds may form and change
In India, RES generators and system operators need to partner with IMD and ISRO
for forecasting of weather and monitoring the cloud movement to improve forecast
of power output from RES Market Design Market design affects the quantity of
flexible resources The flexibility needs of the variable renewables may be
addressed in  variety of ways including pricing, schedule/dispatch interval,
ancillary service market and requirement, capacity market etc Through proper
market design, the roles of capacity market and ramping market, the roles of
distributed generation, storage and demand response into wholesale and ancillary
market, economic curtailment of renewables, resource aggregators etc can be
clearly spelt out Demand Response Demand side management measures encourage the
customers to maximize the use of variable renewable energy sources while the
supply is naturally high For example, when wind and solar PV are producing more
than the demand, demand response can incentivize consumers to use more power
during that time through appropriate price signals of low rates, thus helping
shift the load and ensuring better utilization of generation resources The
change in load may occur automatically in response to time of use or dynamic
rates or due to the direct control by the grid operator or due to participation
of demand response in wholesale, ancillary or capital market To have effective
demand response, smart-grid technologies involving smart meters, communication
and other methods are used Electric vehicle “smart charging” is based on V2G and
G2V concept where electric vehicle can become an integral part of the grid and
are charged or discharged in response to external signals or dynamic prices Grid
Integration Cost Integration of variable RES involves two types of costs namely
Grid Infrastructure Cost and System Operation Cost Grid infrastructure costs
include grid connection and grid upgrading costs Grid connection costs include
the cost of  new transmission line from the variable RES plant to the existing
grid, which would be higher than those for  coal based plant, due to lower CUF
This cost depends basically on the distance between the plant and the grid, the
voltage level of the connection line, and the availability of standard RENEWABLE
ENERGY SOURCES 20 Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan
equipment The grid connection cost is an important economic constraint for
renewables development in remote locations However, these can be overcome to
some extent by using energy storage devices, Phase Shift Transformers (PSTs) and
FACTS devices Grid upgrading costs include the cost of additional network
equipment needed to strengthen the grid in order to integrate renewable power
into the existing grids They depend mostly on the amount of renewable capacity,
the location of the power plants and the structure of the existing grid These
costs can also be mitigating by using energy storage devices, Phase Shift
Transformers (PSTs) and FACTS devices System operation costs can be divided into
system profile costs and short-term system balancing costs These account for the
extra costs of the conventional part of the power system caused by the
integration of variable renewable power Profile costs is  broad concept that
captures all three impacts of the temporal mismatch between VRE generation and
load profile: ) capacity costs (adequacy costs) due to  low VRE capacity credit;
) reduced average utilization of thermal power plants; and ) curtailed VRE
generation to maintain grid security when power supply exceeds demand Short-term
system balancing costs: Due to the variability and uncertainty properties of VRE
generators, the reserve capacity needed for up-and down-regulation increases as
compared to the case where the same energy is delivered by conventional
generation The increased requirements for reserve power lead to the extra costs
for the conventional part of the power system These extra costs originate from
the measures taken to ascertain increased reserve power, for example, by the
operation of conventional plants at partial load, the start-up costs and
contribution of conventional power plants with higher operating costs in the
power system, increased wear-and-tear and maintenance costs of plants 11
BALANCING RESERVES In  synchronous electrical system, the demand and supply of
electricity must balance at every instant of time Any imbalance is reflected in
the variation of frequency Therefore, in case of imbalance, the system is to be
balanced by providing balancing power Based on purpose, response time, and the
way they are activated, balancing power can be categorized as Primary
Control(PC), Secondary Control(SC) and Tertiary Control(TC) PC can be fully
deployed within 30 seconds It is activated by locally measured frequency
deviation PC can be classified as  fast, automatic, spinning reserve that is
used to balance the synchronous system both up and downwards SC has to be
available within five minutes after activation It is activated automatically and
centrally by System Operators SC is used to supplement PC for frequency
restoration, and to re-balance the respective balancing area SC can be supplied
mainly by some hydro plants and gas based plants and to some extent by
synchronized thermal generators Hence, it is an automatic reserve that balances
both the synchronous system and the balancing area up and down To  large extent,
it is  spinning reserve TC is used to replace SC over time It is either directly
activated or in schedules of 15 minutes Activation is  manual decision usually
based on current and expected deployment of SC TC is mostly supplied by stand-by
thermal generators The concept of Balancing power has assumed  great
significance nowadays with the infusion of Variable Renewable Energy(VRE) into
the system VRE generators are weather dependent and are, as such, inherently
stochastic in nature There would be deviation between actual generation and
forecast generation from the VRE generators This deviation may be positive or
negative In case of positive deviation, balancing power needs to be pressed into
service In case of negative deviation, backing down of generation takes place or
alternatively through absorption of extra power by energy storage devices
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES 21 Central Electricity Authority National Electricity
Plan While carrying out balancing, the concept of balancing area and synchronous
system are used In India, the synchronous system is the entire integrated grid
comprising of the five regions and Bhutan Balancing area is  geographical subset
of the synchronous system where imbalance occurs So the balancing area may be
state or  region In the event of an imbalance, the target set point for the
synchronous system is the frequency That is the system frequency is to be
brought to their normal value However, the target set point for the balancing
area is to bring the net deviation between balancing area and the rest of the
synchronous system to ZERO from schedule At present system operators in India
(SLDCs and RLDCs) are playing an active role in balancing the system
Internationally, the developed countries have adopted the integrated approach,
involving system operator, balance responsible parties, supplier of balancing
power and regulators All of these play the role of the system operator and
market operators In India, the market operation is performed mainly by the power
exchanges They must work in tandem for implementing and effective balancing
system The role of the different entities in the integrated approach are
described below: Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) or ‘program responsible
parties’ are market entities that have the responsibility of balancing
portfolio of generators and/or loads BRPs can be utilities, and industrial
consumers, etc They deliver binding schedules to system operators for each
quarter-hour of the next day, and are financially accountable for deviations
from these schedules System operators activate balancing power to physically
balance demand and supply if the sum of BRP imbalances is non-zero Specifically,
system operators have four obligations:  determine the amount of capacity that
has to be reserved for balancing, ex ante  acquire the required balancing power
reserves and determine the price paid for capacity and energy, ex ante  activate
balancing power in moments of physical imbalance, real time  determine the
imbalance price, and clear the system financially, ex post Suppliers of
balancing power reserve the supply capacity, and deliver energy once activated
by the system operator They are obliged to deliver energy under pre-specified
terms, for example, within  certain time frame and with certain ramp rates
Suppliers are traditionally mostly generators, but can also be consumers
Typically, payments received by the suppliers of balancing power have two
components: capacity payment because capacity reservation occasions opportunity
costs, and/or energy payment  system is said to be “actively balanced” when the
system operators deploy balancing power The price paid for this service is the
capacity and the energy payment for balancing power Similarly, if the Balance
Responsible Parties(BRP) takes the price signal and balance the system, it is
said to be “passively balanced” Hence, system operators can either actively
balance the system ordering adjustments via contracted balancing power, or
passively balance the system via sending imbalance price signals to BRPs This is
also called ‘self-balancing’ The time scale of passive balancing can be of
several minutes Hence, it cannot replace balancing power required to respond to
stochastic disturbances Determining the balancing reserve is  challenge under
high VRE infusion scenario There is no unique acceptable methodology for this
Nowadays, instead of deterministic approach, stochastic approach is widely
utilized From the historical data, the forecast errors for wind and solar
generations are found out The errors are assumed to be normally distributed
Taking  confidence limit of 95 or 99%, the reserve requirements are estimated 12

CHAPTER  HYDRO POWER IN INDIA  INTRODUCTION India has considerable hydro power
potential, which being  renewable source of energy can play  key role in
reducing the carbon footprint of the Indian power sector and efforts are being
set afoot in this direction  Hydro Electric Project has  long useful life
extending to well over 50 years and helps in conserving scarce fossil fuels
Development of hydro projects is important to meet the objective of sustainable
development and for energy security of the country Development of hydro power
projects also provides the added advantage of opening up avenues for development
of remote and backward regions of the country Hydro power stations have the
inherent ability for instantaneous starting, stopping and managing load
variability which helps in improving reliability of the power system Hydro
Electric Projects are ideal for meeting the peak requirement and the balancing
requirement arising due to variability of renewable energy sources  HYDRO-
ELECTRIC POWER POTENTIAL AND DEVELOPMENT  Hydro-Electric Potential An assessment
was made of the hydro-electric potential in the country by CEA in the year 1987,
based on observed basic data on topographic features of river basins, discharge
characteristics of rivers at  large number of sites, geological and other
information According to the assessment, the total Hydro Electric Power
potential in the country was assessed as 84,044 MW (at 60% load factor) from
total of 845 number of identified  Schemes which when fully developed would
result in an installed capacity of about ,48,701 MW on the basis of probable
average load factor The total hydro energy potential is assessed as 600 billion
units per year The Great Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra rivers with their
innumerable tributaries originating from the Himalayas constitute about 70% of
the country' assessed hydropower potential In addition, the assessment studies
have also identified 63 sites for Pumped Storage Schemes (PSS) with total
installation of about 96,000 MW In addition to above,  sizable potential was
identified by CEA for development of micro, mini and small hydro schemes on
rivulets and canal drops ,512 no of small hydro-electric schemes having
aggregate installed capacity of above ,782 MW on canal falls/rivers have been
identified The matter relating to  Projects up to 25 MW is being looked after by
MNRE and the potential of small  Projects has been assessed by MNRE as 19,749 MW
As on 31st March,2017, Hydro Electric Schemes (above 25 MW capacity) have  total
installed capacity of 44,478 MW including Pumped storage schemes (PSS) capacity
of ,785 MW The hydro schemes under construction, account to capacity of MW

Winter  HYDRO POWER –  FLEXIBLE SOLUTION The power system operation stability
requires the system to minimise fluctuations between demand and supply This
encompasses, for example, short term reserves (generation, storage, demand
response) to cover potential incidents, which decrease power supply to the
system, or to respond to short-term variations in demand and generation
Hydropower therefore provides an ideal solution for the challenges of
transitioning power system Hydropower brings  strong contribution to flexibility
in the power system today filling the gap between supply and demand that has
been induced by the non-dispatchable variability of RES The storage capabilities
of many hydropower plants make them  perfect instrument for optimising the use
of variable RES over shorter and longer periods Hydropower also provides  number
of ancillary services which are needed in order to manage  transmission system
in  way that secures system stability and security of supply Moreover, during
power system restoration, such as in the case of an extreme event ( blackout),
auxiliary loads of conventional thermal and nuclear power plants need external
power source, which can be provided quickly by hydropower Hydropower plants with
reservoirs reduce the dependency on the variability of the natural inflow and
enable adjustments of power generation to the variability in demand These plants
are operated on  scheduled basis taking into account data regarding water flow
forecast and consumption patterns They are commonly used for intense load
following and to meet peak demand The generation of peak-load energy from
reservoir type hydropower plants allows the optimisation of base-load power
generation from other less flexible electricity sources, such as nuclear and
thermal power plants Besides contributing to water management activities (flood
control, irrigation, drinking water, etc), hydropower plants with reservoirs
also introduce unique benefits to the electricity system There are different
types of hydropower plants with reservoirs Storage hydro plant (or conventional
reservoir-type hydropower plant) takes advantage of large reservoirs with
natural inflow of water and the possibility to reduce or increase the water
outflow instantaneously The water is stored in the reservoir and no pumps are
needed Pumped storage power plants store energy by pumping water from  lower to
higher reservoir and converting the potential energy back into electricity These
reservoirs can be natural or artificial Both types of pumped storage plants
enable the power system to receive and store energy in periods of low demand or
excessive generation, and generate electricity in times of higher demand The
role of pumped storage hydropower plants is twofold: they balance the grid for
demand-driven fluctuations, and balance generation-driven fluctuations Storage
possibilities combined with the instant start and stop of generation make
hydropower plants very flexible Pumped storage and storage hydro with peak
generation are able to cope with high generation-driven fluctuations and can
provide active power within  short period of time Conventional reservoir-type
hydropower plants and pumped storage power plants can provide the full range of
grid- stabilising services in view of their ability to follow demand or
generation fluctuations within only  few minutes There are several different
ancillary services or grid stabilising services of hydropower, thus facilitating
the integration of variable RES into the power system and providing  key tool to
maintain  stable and balanced grid: HYDRO POWER IN INDIA  Central Electricity
Authority National Electricity Plan • Back-up and reserve: hydropower plants
have the ability to enter load into an electrical system from  source that is
not on-line Hydropower can provide this service while not consuming additional
fuel, thereby ensuring minimal emissions • Quick-start capability: hydropower`
quick-start capability takes just  few minutes • Black start capability:
hydropower plants have the capability to run at  zero load When loads increase,
additional power can be delivered rapidly to the system in order to meet demand
• Regulation and frequency response: hydro plants contribute towards maintaining
the frequency within the given margins through continuous modulation of active
power and to address moment-to moment fluctuations in system power requirements
Hydropower` fast response ability makes it especially valuable in covering steep
load gradients (ramp rates) through its fast load-following • Voltage support:
hydropower plants have the ability to control reactive power, thereby ensuring
that power will flow from generation to load They also contribute to maintain
voltage by injecting or absorbing reactive power to the system/Grid • Spinning
reserve: hydropower supports the dynamic behaviour of the grid operation
Hydropower plants can provide spinning reserve – additional power supply that
can be made available to the transmission system within  few seconds in case of
unexpected load changes in the grid Hydropower plants with  small reservoir are
sometimes also called pondage plants These are designed to modulate generation
on  daily or weekly basis Pondage plants can provide flexibility services mainly
through balancing power They also provide frequency and voltage control as
ancillary services Run-of-river hydro plants have little or no storage capacity
They therefore offer short-term storage possibilities (few minutes’ dynamic
cycle), thus allowing for some adaptation to demand, especially for ancillary
services, such as frequency and voltage control To sum up, flexibility solutions
of hydropower include:  accommodating large variations in residual demand (to
counter variability of RES, as sun does not always shine and wind does not blow
constantly),  providing increasing ramp rates in real time, caused by sudden
changes of generation  offsetting unexpected variations in production due to
forecast errors in the intra-day markets or in the form of balancing power or
ancillary services The hydro capacity of 44,479 MW (as on 31st March,2017)
consist of 67 MW Run of River(RoR); 15,139 MW RoR with pondage; 20,942 MW
storage type includes MW of pump storage type The region wise types of hydro are
detailed in Table  HYDRO POWER IN INDIA  Central Electricity Authority National

Considering 80% availability of storage type plant and 50% availability of RoR

more than 25000 MW  PUMPED STORAGE PLANTS – BEST FRIEND OF ELECTRICITY GRID
While many forms of energy storage systems have been installed globally, Pumped
Storage Plants (PSP) are playing an increasingly important role in providing
peaking power and maintaining system stability in the power system of many
countries Pumped storage technology is the long term technically proven, cost
effective, highly efficient and operationally flexible way of energy storage on
large scale to store intermittent and variant energy generated by solar and wind
PSPs improve overall economy of power system operation, increase capacity
utilization of thermal stations and reduce operational problems of thermal
stations during light load period The other advantages of pumped storage
development are availability of spinning reserve at almost no cost to the system
and regulating frequency to meet sudden load changes in the network PSPs have
the ability to provide ancillary benefits such as flexible capacity, voltage
support and Black- start facility etc Pumped storage technology has advanced
significantly since its original introduction and now includes adjustable speed
pumped turbines which can quickly shift from motor, to generator, to synchronous
condenser modes, for easier and more flexible operation of the Grid Out of
96,524 MW of pumped storage potential identified in India by CEA at 63 sites, at
present  pumped storage schemes with aggregate installed capacity of ,786 MW are
in operation out of which only  Nos plants with aggregate installed capacity of
,600 MW are being operated in pumping mode The remaining  Nos plants with an
installed capacity of about ,200 MW are not operating in pumping mode mainly
because the 2nd reservoir is either under construction or the same has not been
constructed Efforts should be made to complete and operationalize the pump
storage projects not running in PSP mode by resolving the issues  PSP operation

in  day, then, it can generate for 25 hours assuming 75% overall efficiency It
is seen, from the above analysis, that as long as the price for 25 hours is more
than (/25 ~ 33) times the pumping price, it implies payment for only fixed costs
of pumped storage If the overall efficiency improves to 80%, the need for price
differential in peak hours reduces to 25% HYDRO POWER IN INDIA 12 Central
Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan In view of infusion of high RES,
Pump Storage Development has to be treated as  separate category Separate Policy
instrument is required to incentivize PSPs The pumped storage capacity was
assessed by CEA in 1987, since then there have been many changes in environment
laws & technology which calls for re-assessment of the potential In India, with
increased penetration of RES in the grid, present practice of real time
imbalance management may not be sufficient for handling large scale uncertainty
in RES and limit the integration of renewable energy generation The transmission
corridors for evacuation of renewable power is being firmed up for the plan of
having 175 GW of RE power in next  years, it is imperative to develop more PSPs
and the benefits being given to RE projects may also be extended to the PSPs The
development of pumped storage particularly in the areas with concentrated wind
and solar generation would significantly improve the grid reliability and it
would act as the best partner for the Renewable Energy integration While
benefits of having pumped storage hydro power are known but current market
structures and regulatory frameworks do not present an effective means of
achieving this goal There is need for regulatory mechanism/ market incentives
for effective integration of new generation, energy storage and transmission or
that makes the PSP  commercially viable proposition Regulatory Commissions may
incentivize Tariff for PSPs and financial institutions should consider providing
attractive terms for financing of PSPs  IMPORTANCE OF HYDRO IN PRESENT SCENARIO
The current development profile and trends in generation capacity addition in
India have resulted in the following aspects: • Skewed development pattern
between different generation technologies: The current portfolio of installed
capacity of ,26,MW as on 2017 is dominated by thermal power with around % share
Hydro, with an installed capacity of 44,MW has  share of around % Adequate
diversity in generation asset base has not been maintained with growth in hydro
assets not being concomitant with growth in the thermal asset base This also
impacts the long-term least cost development pattern with over reliance on
25-year thermal plants vis- -vis more than 40-year hydro assets • Inadequate
peaking and quick response capability: While regional grids have been integrated
and frequency regimes have been streamlined, the country faces lack of assets
capable of meeting peaking deficits and with quick response characteristics For
meeting peak requirement and to mitigate the variability due to renewable energy
sources of the order of 175 GW by 2022 and in the shortage of gas, the peak and
the balancing requirement is to be primarily met by Hydro Electric Projects •
Sustainable low carbon development: While India is considering  low carbon
strategy and actively considering focusing on Energy Efficient Renovation &
Modernization to utilise existing assets, the low carbon strategy can be
fostered further with  higher thrust on green capacity additions via hydropower
development These factors necessitate renewed emphasis on ’responsible
hydropower development’ to promote economic growth Hydro’ critical role in
sustainable development and energy security for the country is based on the
elements of sustainability, availability and affordability  CURRENT ISSUES AND
CHALLENGES Development of hydro power projects is fraught with  number of
uncertainties Broadly, the problems faced by developers can be grouped into
those related to the project location, to its geology, and to issues of
resettlement and rehabilitation Typically, hydro projects are high cost, long
gestation projects and are highly vulnerable to any uncertainties ) Land
Acquisition Issues Land availability and acquisition are among the core
structural issues that impact almost all infrastructure sectors Problems arising
in the acquisition of land for hydropower projects are causing suspension and
delay in construction activities HYDRO POWER IN INDIA 13 Central Electricity
Authority National Electricity Plan ) Environment and Forest issues Hydropower
projects often require forest areas for their implementation and compensatory
afforestation on non-forest lands Progress of many projects has been affected on
account of delay and non-clearance on environment and forest aspects
Construction and operation of hydropower dams can significantly affect natural
river systems as well as fish and wildlife populations ) Rehabilitation &
Resettlement Issues Hydropower projects involve submergence causing the
displacement of project area people The rehabilitation of project affected
people is also  major issue which is more pronounced in the case of storage-
based hydropower projects ) Enabling infrastructure  number of hydropower
projects are located in remote sites in States which do not have adequate demand
for electricity This creates the requirement for developing enabling
infrastructure for power evacuation The ’chicken neck’ presents geographical
constraints in developing requisite transmission infrastructure for hydropower
evacuation from the north east There are certain other challenges for the
coordinated development of the transmission network,  identifying beneficiaries
well in advance, developing excess evacuation capacity keeping in mind the
future development of projects (especially where there are Right of Way (RoW)
issues) Furthermore, the Plant Load Factor (PLF) for hydropower projects is
typically less than 50%, as  result of which significant transmission capacity
is under-utilised All these result in higher transmission costs Hydropower
projects also require the development of associated infrastructure such as roads
and bridges in the area Inclusion of the cost of development of such associated
infrastructure increases the cost of power generated affecting project viability
and sustainability Lack of infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and
difficult access to sites often become blocks to moving skilled manpower to
difficult project sites ) Law & Order / Local issues Protests by the local
people against the construction activities like blasting, muck disposal etc and
demands for employment, extra compensation etc often create law and order
problems which delays the commencement and affects progress of the works )
Technical challenges Techno economic viability of hydropower projects depends on
the geology, topography, hydrology and accessibility of the project site Even if
extensive investigations using State-of the-art investigation and construction
techniques are adopted, an element of uncertainty remains in the sub-surface
geology Geological surprises during actual construction cannot be ruled out This
unpredictable geology is more pronounced in the young fold Himalayas where most
of the Indian hydropower potential resides Such technical challenges add to
construction risks ) Natural Calamities Natural calamities like unprecedented
rain / flash floods, cloud burst, earthquake etc delay the completion of project
) Inter-State Issues Planning for hydropower development in India has generally
been oriented toward individual projects However, this approach has several
limitations for sustainable development of an entire river basin Inter-State
disputes are another aspect which hinders integrated river basin development for
hydropower projects  large number of hydropower projects with common river
systems between adjoining States are held up due to  lack of inter-State
agreements and disputes on water-sharing ) Tariff Design for Hydro HYDRO POWER
IN INDIA 14 Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan Tariffs
remaining static for the entire life time of the hydro project doesn’ send the
right signal as far as hydro dispatch is concerned The tariff design therefore
needs to reflect the current capital cost and value of the hydro energy with the
gains split between the power plant and its beneficiaries as decided by the
Appropriate Commission There is need for all hydro power to have  two-part
tariff comprising of  fixed cost and variable cost Conventionally, the variable
cost of hydro power stations is considered as NIL; so  hybrid tariff model is
required for all hydro power stations similar to that prevailing for the power
stations whose tariff is decided by the Central Electricity Regulatory
Commission (CERC) Currently, the Annual Fixed Charges (AFC) of such power plants
is divided equally into Fixed Charge and Energy Charge with the latter
apportioned amongst the saleable Design Energy (DE) for the whole year The DE
figures should be available both on ten daily basis as well as monthly basis for
50% and 90% dependable years and these figures should be available on public
domain Policy needs to promote coordination between IMD and CWC for creating
infrastructure for inflow forecasting and precipitation forecasting in the
catchment area of  river basin 10) Non-availability of Grid power during initial
stage During construction stage the grid power supply is generally not available
at construction site Hence the construction power is being fed through the DG
sets the supply to diesel to such remote location takes huge time which delays
the commencement and effect progress of the work 11) Safety and security problem
Most of the untapped hydro projects of the country are in remote and border
areas like &, Arunachal Pradesh etc disturbance from locals and security threats
in border area is being faced  POLICY INITIATIVES TAKEN FOR INCREASING THE HYDRO
CAPACITY The Government has taken several policy initiatives/measures to tap the
hydro potential and to boost hydro power development in the country The details
are given below:  National Electricity Policy, 2005 National Electricity Policy,
2005 was notified by Govt of India on The salient features of the policy are
given below:  The policy lays maximum emphasis on full development of the
feasible hydro potential in the country which will facilitate economic
development of States, particularly North Eastern States, Uttarakhand, Himachal
Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir  Since the hydel projects call for comparatively
larger capital investment, debt financing of longer tenure has been recommended
 The State Governments have been advised to review procedure for land
acquisition and other approvals/ clearances for speedy implementation of hydro
projects  Full support of Central Government has been extended for hydel
development by offering the services of CPSUs like NHPC, NEEPCO, SJVNL, THDC etc
Hydro Power Policy- 2008: Salient Features Hydro Power Policy, 2008 has been
notified by Govt of India on 31st March,The salient features of the policy are
given below:  Transparent selection criteria for awarding sites to private
developers  Enables developer to recover his additional costs through merchant
sale of upto  maximum of 40% of the saleable energy  Developer to provide 100
units of electricity per month to each Project Affected Family - in cash or kind
or  combination of both for 10 years from the COD HYDRO POWER IN INDIA 15
Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan  Developer to assist in
implementing rural electrification in the vicinity of the project area &
contribute 10% share of the State Govt under the RGGVY scheme  Additional %
free power from the project (over and above 12% free power earmarked for the
host State) for Local Area Development Fund - regular revenue stream for welfare
schemes, creation of additional infrastructure and common facilities  The State
Governments to contribute  matching % from their share of 12% free power  Tariff
Policy, 2016 (Portions relevant to Hydropower)  Intent of Govt for promotion of
HEP emphasized in the objective of the Policy - “To promote HEP generation
including PSP to provide adequate peaking reserves, reliable grid operation and
integration of variable RE sources”  Renewable Purchase Obligation – Hydropower
excluded from RPO (% of the total consumption excluding Hydro power)  As
notified in Revised Tariff Policy, 2016, Cost plus Tariff regime (in which
tariff is to be determined by the regulator under section 62 of Electricity Act,
2003) has been extended for public & private sector hydro power projects up to 
Certainty of long term PPA for min 60% of capacity, balance through merchant
sale - Provision for extension of PPA beyond 35 years for  further period of 15
years  Enabling provision for suitable regulatory framework incentivizing HEPs
for using long term financial instruments - in order to reduce tariff burden in
the initial years  Depreciation – Developer shall have the option of charging
lower rate of depreciation vis--vis the ceiling determined by CERC  Right to
Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Act, 2013 Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 has been notified by the
Govt of India on 2013 which have more participation of local people in terms of
Land acquisition and Rehabilitation & Resettlement The main objectives of the
Act are given below:  To ensure  humane, participative, informed and
transparent process for land acquisition with the least disturbance to the
owners of the land and other affected families  Provide just and fair
compensation to the affected families whose land has been acquired or proposed
to be acquired or are affected by such acquisition  Make adequate provisions
for such affected persons for their rehabilitation and resettlement  Ensure
that affected persons become partners in development leading to an improvement
in their post- acquisition social and economic status  Other Measures Taken for
Increasing the Hydro Capacity   Consultation Process has been evolved for Fast
Tracking of & activities and preparation of Quality DPRs wherein appraising
agencies advise Developer in carrying out various investigations and firming up
the project layout etc  Time bound appraisal norms have been evolved in CEA for
examination of DPRs   number of projects have been prioritized which are being
monitored regularly at highest levels by the Govt of India for their expeditious
implementation  Central Electricity Authority (CEA) is monitoring the progress
of each project regularly through frequent site visits, interaction with the
developers and critical study of monthly progress reports   Power Project
Monitoring Panel (PPMP) has been set up by the Ministry of Power to
independently follow up and monitor the progress of the hydro projects HYDRO
POWER IN INDIA 16 Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan 
Regular review meetings are taken by Ministry of Power/ CEA with equipment
manufacturers, State Utilities/ CPSUs/ Project developers, etc to sort out the
critical issues  Review meetings are taken by MoP/ CEA with Border Road
Organization, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways etc to sort out the
infrastructure issues  CONCLUSIONS  Most hydro facilities have the ability to
manage net-load variability and uncertainty Hydro plants would be able to
provide  more valued service to the grid than the manner in which they have
historically been used , in view of high penetration of solar and wind energy 
Hydro plants shall be considered for compensation for balancing the grid by
implementing differential tariff for peak and off-peak power Pumped storage
plants should be encouraged to operate in pump mode by providing incentive for
its operation  Infrastructure cost from the Hydro project may be excluded for
determining tariff As the need for generation resources that can provide system
flexibility increases with an increased proportional penetration of variable
renewables, the value of hydropower and pumped storage will become more
significant  At Present, Central Financial Assistance/ Support in the form of
grant/ assistance/ subsidy is being provided by the Govt to the renewable small
Hydro Projects up to 25MW capacity Extension of this Financial Assistance/
Support to all hydro projects (irrespective of the size/ capacity) is likely to

BASED POWER PLANTS  INTRODUCTION Natural Gas is one of the cleanest fuels with
less carbon dioxide per joule delivered than either by coal or oil and contains
far fewer pollutants than other hydrocarbon fuels and therefore the Natural gas
has emerged as the most preferred fuel due to its inherent environmentally
benign nature, easy transportability, ease of use, greater efficiency and cost
effectiveness The development of Natural Gas industry in the country started in
1960s with discovery of gas fields in Assam and Gujarat After discovery of South
Basin fields by ONGC in 1970s, Natural Gas assumed importance The Exploration
activities in India were earlier carried out only by the National Oil Companies
(ONGC & OIL) under nomination regime Later private companies were allowed to
enter into exploration through JV with National Oil Companies (NOCs) under Pre-
NELP (New Exploration Licensing Policy ) regime Subsequently, 100% foreign
participation in exploration was allowed in the current NELP regime Later
discoveries were made in Gujarat, Krishna Godavari (KG) basin, Cauvery basin,
Tripura, Assam etc Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) is
introduced in March, 2016 for  uniform licensing system to cover all
hydrocarbons such as oil, gas, coal bed methane etc under  single licensing
framework coupled with open acreage policy The demand of natural gas has sharply
increased in the last two decades at the global level In India, the natural gas
sector has gained importance, particularly over the last decade However, the
supply is not keeping pace with the demand There is shortage of natural gas for
the fertilizer plants, power plants and petrochemical complexes The power and
fertilizer industries emerged as the key demand drivers for natural gas due to
the scale of their operations, policy intervention and social impact In an
agrarian economy such as India, the priority has been the production of
fertilizers  BACKGROUND In India, Natural gas produced from domestic sources is
being allocated to different sectors by Central Government as per policy
guidelines issued from time to time In case of imported gas, the marketers are
free to import Re-gasified Liquid Natural Gas (RLNG) and sell the RLNG to
customers Gas based generation in India got the impetus when HVJ (Hajira-
Vijaypur-Jagdishpur) gas pipeline was commissioned by GAIL in the 80' after
discovery of gas in the west coast of India This led to commissioning of  number
of Gas based Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) along the HVJ pipe line in the
Western and Northern part of India Prior to that, very little gas based
generation was present in the North East Apart from the major HVJ trunk
pipeline, certain regional gas grids like in KG basin and Kaveri basin also
helped in development of some gas based power generation capacities Isolated
fields are located mainly in parts of Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and North-Eastern
Region With the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), gas exploration in
India got an impetus and the discovery of gas in Krishna Godavari Dhirubhai
(KGD6) field by Reliance Industries Limited in 2002, was expected to be  turning
point in gas production in the country With the commissioning of East West
pipeline by Reliance Gas Infrastructure India Limited, KGD6 gas got infused into
the system in early With the commencement of production from KGD6 field and the
expectation of considerable increase in the volume of production from this
field, number of gas based plants were taken up for implementation in the
country even without firm allocation of gas The peak flow of the gas in KGD6
fields was expected to be about 80 MMSCMD, by the end of the year 2009, and was
to increase further in subsequent years Before the commencement of production
from KGD6 fields, gas based power plants were operating primarily with the
allocated Administrative Price Mechanism(APM) /Non APM/Panna-Mukta-Tapi- Ravva
basin gas from nominated fields, but these supplies were short of their
requirement When KGD6 gas production was about to start in 2009, Empowered Group
of Ministers (EGoM) on pricing and utilization for natural gas under New
Exploration and Licensing Programme (NELP) made allocation of 17 MMSCMD of KGD6
gas to power sector in May 2008 and October The EGoM in its meeting held on 23
rd August,2013 decided that the entire additional NELP gas production, available
during the years ,  &  after meeting the supply level of MMSCMD to fertilizer
sector, be supplied to the power sector Supply of KGD6 gas was started in  with
67 MMSCMD and reached  peak of 35 MMSCMD in 2010- The gas from KGD6 started
gradually declining to 33 MMSCMD in  ,74 MMSCMD in  and only 14 MMSCMD in June,
Contrary to the projections, the gradual reduction in production from KGD6 upset
GAS BASED POWER PLANTS   Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan
the gas based capacity addition programme in the country When the production
from KGD6 field fell to 16 MMSCMD in March, 2013, the supplies to power sector
got reduced to zero Table  below shows the availability of KGD6 Gas to all
sectors in various years starting from 2009-Table  Availability of KG-D6 gas to

installed capacity of ,26,833 MW as on 31st March,2017,  capacity of 25,330 MW
(about 75%) is from gas based power plants However, capacity of 24,037MW is
being monitored by CEA Out of the total monitored capacity,  capacity of 21,048
MW is connected with Main Pipeline/Gas grid and 2989 MW is connected with
isolated gas fields Of the grid connected gas based capacity of 21,048 MW, ,042
MW is predominantly APM gas based and ,897 MW is predominantly on KG D6 gas
Besides this  capacity of ,110 MW has been commissioned without any gas
allocation In addition,  capacity of 406 MW is under construction and is likely
to be commissioned by 2021-Normative Gas requirement to operate the existing
Power plants of capacity of 24,037 MW at 90% Plant Load Factor (PLF) is about
117 MMSCMD However, the total domestic gas allocated to power projects is 05
MMSCMD and average gas supplied to these gas based power plants during the year
was only 59 MMSCMD The gas grid connected capacity had received 22 MMSCMD gas
during the year  and achieved average PLF of around 19% only and gas based
capacity connected with isolated gas field had received 37 MMSCMD gas and
achieved  PLF of 43 % Therefore, the average Plant Load Factor of gas based
generation capacity in the country during 2016- 17 is about 86% Details of gas

BASED POWER PLANTS Natural gas based power generation has many advantages over
other conventional energy sources mainly on account of its lesser impact on the
environment and better economics However, despite these advantages, due to
shortage of domestic gas, India’ energy mix is skewed towards coal compared to
other countries, with gas based power share in India only % against the world
average of around 22% Gas based power plants require significantly less land and
water in comparison to coal based power plant of the same capacity In addition,
gas based plants with quick ramping can support the renewable balancing power
requirements This gains importance especially in the context of India’
aspiration to rapidly scale up renewable generation Besides, gas based capacity
will minimize the need for other alternative modes of power generation during
peak hours of power shortage such as using diesel generators etc, which are not
only costlier but also result in more environmental pollution It may also be
noted that gas based power generation would reduce carbon emissions, as
emissions from gas based power generation is less as compared to Diesel or coal
based generation Details are shown in the Table  Table  CO2 emission from
various fuels Particulars of the Plant Capacity (MW) Gross Station Heat Rate

However, due to acute shortage of domestic gas and higher price of imported
natural gas, gas based power plants are not in  position to run their plants
efficiently CAPACITY ADDITION DURING  AND GAS REQUIREMENT  In view of the
shortage of gas, Ministry of Power had issued an advisory in March, 2012 for the
developers not to plan power projects based on domestic gas till , as
projections for  and  given by MoP & NG could not support any new capacity
World Bank – World Development Indicators data GAS BASED POWER PLANTS   Central
Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan Due to uncertainty in
availability of domestic gas, though there was  capacity of about ,500 MW are at
advanced stage of construction, only  capacity of 406 MW is likely to be
commissioned during the period 2017- GAS BASED POWER PLANTS AS PEAKING PLANTS
Government of India has chalked out  program of massive capacity addition from
RES by The total RES capacity by March, 2022 is planned to be 175 GW The
generation from RES shall be treated as must-run Therefore, at any instant, the
net system demand after absorbing the generation from RES ( Net Demand = Total
Demand -generation from RES) needs to be met through conventional generation
sources The solar generation would be maximum during the day time when the
system demand is quite low and would be “NIL” during evening peak hours This
would make the Net Demand Curve very steep and would require generation from
conventional sources which can ramp up very fast This necessitates dedicated
peaking plants Further, infusion of significant quantum of RES into the grid
will also need availability of adequate balancing power to take care of the
variability and uncertainty associated with RES generation Balancing requirement
as well as ramping requirement of the grid can be sourced in order of priority
from Hydro plants, Pumped Storage Plants and Open Cycle Gas Turbine Plants
followed by Closed Cycle Gas Turbine Plants Now, out of the total hydro capacity
of 44,42 MW as on 31st March,2017, 25,75 MW are storage type, 67 MW are run-of
the river type and 15,139 MW are run-of the river with pondage type Irrigational
requirement, failure of monsoon etc limit the availability of hydro power Again,
capacity addition from hydro plants are taking place at  very limited pace due
to  host of reasons like delay in environmental and forest clearance, & problems
etc Adequate Pumped Storage Plants are also not available Therefore, for
balancing, gas based plants has to be utilised Gas based plants are of two types
namely open cycle gas plants and combined cycle gas plants Open cycle gas plants
are very suitable for balancing and ramping requirement of the grid because of
its quick start and stop time But open cycle gas based plants are less efficient
than the closed cycle ones Now, of the total monitored gas based capacity of
24,037 MW, 350 MW is only open cycle and the balance are closed cycle plants
However, the new gas-based combined cycle power plants offer higher efficiency
and can go from start to full load quicker The total start-up time is just 30
minutes (from warm start) and shutdown time is 30 minutes These are single shaft
machines, can operate at  minimum load of 20%, and therefore are best suited to
cater the variability of RES Presently, there is acute shortage of domestic gas
for the Gas Based Power Plants During the year , Gas Based Plants were running
at  PLF of around 86% To run gas plant at  PLF of 85%, normative gas requirement
would be about 110 MMSCMD This is significantly more than the present
availability of 88 MMSCMD The role of gas based plants during evening to meet
the balancing power and ramping requirement is vital for the Indian grid
Optimisation studies showed that for integrating renewables of 175 GW by  and to
meet the peaking and ramping requirement of the system, PLF of gas based
capacity during  is likely to be around 37% compared to around 22% at present
The gas requirement is of the order of about 27 MMSCMD It has been observed from
the studies that the gas based capacities are utilised maximum during the peak
hours to meet the peak and the ramping requirement The actual gas requirement
may substantially get reduced in the event of any or all of the followings: 
Maximisation of utilisation of domestic gas during peak hours to meet the
peaking and the ramping requirement  Utilisation of full peaking potential of
the hydro plants  Operation of some of the coal based thermal power plants in
two shift Efforts should be made for exploring the modalities of implementation
of the above keeping in view the grid stability, and commercial issues involved
threin  STEPS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT TO OVERCOME SHORTAGE OF GAS Government of
India has adopted  multi-pronged strategy to augment gas supplies and bridge the
gap between supply and demand for the domestic market These include: - GAS BASED
POWER PLANTS   Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan  Policy
to grant relaxation, extension & classifications at development & production
stage for early monetization of hydrocarbon discoveries  Discovered Small Field
Policy  Formulation of Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) in
March, Four main facets of this policy are: ) Uniform license for exploration
and production of all forms of hydrocarbon The uniform licence will enable the
contractor to explore conventional as well as unconventional oil and gas
resources including CBM, shale gas/oil, tight gas and gas hydrates under  single
license The concept of Open Acreage Policy will enable & companies choose the
blocks from the designated area ) an open acreage policy, ) easy to administer
revenue sharing model and ) marketing and pricing freedom for the crude oil and
natural gas produced The decision will enhance domestic oil & gas production,
bring substantial investment in the sector and generate sizable employment The
policy is also aimed at enhancing transparency and reducing administrative
discretion  Policy for marketing freedom for gas produced from Deepwater &
Ultra Deepwater areas  MOP&NG is taking necessary steps to augment production
of natural gas from the gas fields/wells by awarding gas blocks for Exploration
& Production activities in various sedimentary basins of the country under the
New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP)  Encouraging import of gas in the form
of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and also making efforts for import of gas through
international pipelines projects Implementation of Natural Gas Hydrate Programme
(NGHP) for evaluation of hydrate resources and their possible commercial
exploitation Introduction of scheme for utilisation of gas based generation
capacity    SCHEME FOR UTILIZATION OF GAS BASED GENERATION CAPACITY In order
to optimally utilize gas based generation capacity and to meet the gas
requirement of grid connected gas based capacity, Government of India has
sanctioned  scheme which envisages supply of imported spot Liquefied Natural Gas
(LNG) to the stranded gas based power plants as well as plants receiving
domestic gas to revive and improve utilization of the stranded gas based power
generation capacity in the country The mechanism also envisages sacrifices to be
made collectively by all stakeholders, including the Central and State
Governments by way of exemptions from certain applicable taxes and levies on the
incremental LNG being imported for the purpose The scheme envisages supply of
imported spot Liquefied Natural Gas to the stranded gas based power plants
through  reverse -bidding process The scheme is to be implemented for the years
and 2016-The scheme envisages financial support from PSDF (Power System
Development Fund) The outlay for the support from PSDF has been fixed at ₹ ,500
crores (₹ ,500 crores and ₹ ,000 crores for the year  and  respectively)  gas
based capacity of 14,305 MW, comprising ,194 MW of gas based plants having
predominantly allocation from KGD6 fields, ,762 MW of gas based capacity
commissioned without any gas allocation and ,349 MW of new gas based capacity
which are ready for commissioning (if gas is made available) were considered as
stranded The following interventions/ sacrifices are envisaged in the scheme, to
be made by the Central Government, State Governments, power developers and gas
transporters collectively ) Streamlining the procedure for availing Customs duty
waiver on imported LNG for the gas based power plants ) Waiver of Value Added
Tax (VAT) on the -bid RLNG ) Waiver of Central Sales Tax (CST), Octroi and Entry
Tax on the -bid RLNG ) Waiver of Service Tax on regasification and
transportation of the -bid RLNG ) Reduction in pipeline tariff charges by 50%,
reduction in marketing margin by 75% on incremental volumes by GAIL / other
transporters on the -bid RLNG ) Capping of fixed cost to be recovered by the
promoters: Power developers to forgo return on their equity ) Provision for co-
mingling and swapping of gas GAS BASED POWER PLANTS   Central Electricity
Authority National Electricity Plan ) Exemption from transmission charges and
losses for such stranded gas based power projects on lines of solar power on
generation from the -bid RLNG ) Support from Power System Development Fund
(PSDF)  RECOMMENDATIONS  The scheme for utilisation of gas based generation
capacity introduced by Government of India is for two years only But it is felt
that  long term policy intervention is required for optimal utilization of gas
based capacity in the country  In view of massive capacity addition target of
175 GW from RES, Gas Based Power plants in the country need to play  vital role
in balancing and ramping requirements of the grid Availability of at least 27
MMSCMD of gas to Gas Based Plants in the country needs to be ensured for this
purpose The actual gas requirement may reduce if full peaking potential of the
hydro plants can be utilised and if the coal based thermal power plants can
operated in  two shift  The regasification capacity in the country is also
matter of concern for gas based power plants, particularly those who are
connected with RGTIL East-West pipeline Due to technical constraints like
directional flows etc, imported RLNG from west coast cannot be transported to
power plants located in the East Coast Therefore, facility of re-gasification
capacity may be suitably created at East coast also GAS BASED POWER PLANTS

Plan CHAPTER  COAL REQUIREMENT  INTRODUCTION Fuel is the key input required to
be tied up before implementation and proper operation of the thermal power
plants In the changed scenario with growing concern on environment, Government
has given emphasis on Renewable Energy projects However, Country’ reliance on
coal based generation cannot be overlooked An important aspect which, therefore,
needs to be addressed is the availability of adequate coal to fuel the
generation of power In order to optimize coal usage, Government is committed for
super critical/ ultra-super critical technology which are much more efficient
and results into reduction in usage of coal The timely availability of all the
key inputs including fuel would ensure timely completion of the project and
therefore avert detrimental implications of cost and time overruns in case the
power project is delayed This Chapter broadly deals with  review of coal
availability during the 12th Plan, an assessment of requirement of fuel for the
period  & indicative requirement of the coal for the period  as well as critical
issues which need to be addressed and constraints being experienced in the coal
sector This would give  broad scenario to all the associated stakeholders to
enable them to take advance action and plan their production targets etc  COAL
SUPPLY SCENARIO  Background Coal is the mainstay of India’ energy sector The All
India Installed Capacity of the country is about 326,848 MW as on 2017, out of
which about 192,163 MW (%) is coal based Once the power station is commissioned,
the biggest challenge is to operate the station at  high plant load factor
(PLF), which is  measure of the output of  power plant compared to the maximum
output it could produce Higher load factor usually means more output and  lower
cost per unit of electricity generation Performance of the power plant is
measured on the basis of PLF and Station Heat Rate However, the Plant Load
Factor (PLF) of the coal based power stations in the country has been decreasing
steadily over the years The PLF has decreased from % in  to 64 % in 2016- New
Coal Distribution Policy The Government has introduced the New Coal Distribution
Policy (NCDP), effective from 1st April 2009, which assures supplies at pre-
determined prices to some categories of consumers and reintroduces -auctions to
encourage  vibrant market for the commodity The Main Features of the Policy are
as follows:  100% Normative Requirement of coal would be considered for supply
to Power Utilities  Supply of coal through commercially enforceable Fuel Supply
Agreements (FSAs) at notified prices by CIL  10% of annual production of CIL to
be offered through -auction for consumers who are not able to source coal
through available institutional mechanism  FSAs to indicate Annual Contracted
Quantities (ACQ) of coal to Power Utilities by coal companies during entire year

enhance coal availability, multi-dimensional efforts are underway by Coal India
Ltd to enhance production of domestic coal  road map has been prepared by CIL to
substantially enhance coal production level to  Billion Tonnes (BT) by the year
2019-With this programme there would be no shortage in the availability of coal
for the power plants during  and 2026-In addition, coal production from the
captive coal blocks allotted to power utilities would also supplement the
availability of domestic coal  Issues/constraints in making coal available to
power stations Timely availability of adequate coal is extremely crucial for
maximizing generation from the power plants In addition to tapping fuel source
or organizing its availability, it is also essential to create the
infrastructure to facilitate fuel to reach the intended destination Therefore,
development of mines/ ports and requisite transportation facilities commensurate
with the completion of the projects is very necessary The gestation period in
the development of mines and even transport facilities are in some cases longer
than the gestation period for setting up of thermal power stations It is,
therefore, imperative for the Power Sector to make its prospective coal
requirement, over  long time horizon, known to the Ministry of Coal, Railways
and port authorities to enable them to undertake co-ordinated development of
coal mines and transport infrastructure with the coming up of thermal power
stations  NEW INITIATIVES FOR ADDRESSING ISSUES RELATED TO COAL SUPPLY TO THE
POWER PLANTS  Rationalization of Coal Linkages In order to undertake
comprehensive review of existing sources of coal and considering the feasibility
of rationalization of these sources to optimize cost of coal transportation,
new Inter-Ministerial Task Force (IMTF) was constituted by Ministry of Coal in
June, Also CIL engaged / KPMG Advisory Services Private Ltd to assist the Task
Force in optimization exercise Report of Inter-Ministerial Task Force (IMTF) and
Part- of KPMG report was discussed with the power utilities on 2nd December,
IMTF report was agreed by the concerned power utilities As per KPMG, total
benefit by way of logistic savings was expected in the range of ₹ 3500 to ₹ 6000
crores The new Inter-Ministerial Task Force (IMTF) had recommended  three step
approach for implementation  The recommendations inter-alia included
rationalization of linkage sources for 19 power utilities in Stage- by swapping
linkage coal between different coal companies to optimize distances and
maximizing dispatches of coal As per status of implementation of recommendations
of IMTF, Coal India Ltd executed revised Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) with 17
power plants in respect of Stage- rationalization This had resulted in movement
rationalization of MT coal with annual savings of ₹ 913 crores (approximately)
of recurring transportation cost COAL REQUIREMENT   Central Electricity
Authority National Electricity Plan ii The Task Force recommended
rationalization of  swap sets among power utilities in Stage-II which envisaged
swapping of coal between ‘imported coal and domestic coal’ and ‘domestic coal of
different power stations among  States involving 11 power utilities in Centre
/State/ Private Sector iii Among the participating companies, 19 swaps were
envisaged Out of these swaps, only  swaps (saving 952 Crores) were agreed for
implementation However, with the improved availability of coal for pit head
power plants, the swaps agreed for swapping of imported coal with domestic coal
for pit head plants was not feasible Thus, at present, only  swaps (saving ₹ 687
Crores) are under implementation/consideration and out of which, only one set of
swap has been implemented result in movement of rationalization of  MT coal and
potential annual savings of ₹ 458 crores of transportation cost With the
implementation of Stage- and Stage-II of recommendations of the IMTF, movement
rationalization of MT coal has been taken is with potential annual saving of ₹
1371 crores of transportation cost  Third Party Sampling In order to address
quality concern of the coal supply to power plants, it was decided in the
meeting held in Ministry of Power on 2015 that coal samples shall be collected
and prepared by  Single Third Party Agency appointed by power utilities and coal
companies It was suggested that CIMFR may undertake bidding process for
appointment of Third Party Sampling Agencies on behalf of power utilities and
coal companies Necessary funding arrangement shall be made by coal companies and
power utilities on equal sharing basis  committee constituted with Director
(Operations), NTPC and Director (Marketing), Coal India Ltd as Co- Chairman with
representatives from CEA, NTPC, CIL, DVC, APP, State of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh,
Rajasthan, Haryana, Karnataka and Railways to look into the issues of Third
Party Sampling has been constituted and prepared  road map for implementation of
decisions on Third Party Sampling The terms of reference for the committee was
as under:  The committee to look into issues of third party sampling for coal
supplies for power sector including - auction ii The issue of re-grading of
mines in case there is persistence variation of mine declared grades with
results of third party sampling iii Issue of coal shortfall on account of energy
shortage due to grade slippage as per third party report at loading end iv Issue
of non-materialization of quantity of coal due to non-placement of Railway rakes
against indents of CIL  Issue of adjustment of quantity of coal due to variation
in actual delivered quantity vs normative wagon carrying capacity vi Involvement
of Railways to ensure transportation of coal as per billed quality and quantity
vii Feasibility of the following aspects:  Use of IT in GPS tracking of coal
supply  On-line coal analysers/auto samplers to address issues at loading end 
Online submission of analysis results of coal samples for speedy settlement of
bills It has been decided that CIMFR will undertake the work of third party
sampling at unloading point, , at the power plant end Therefore, with the
sampling of coal at loading and at unloading point will address the issues of
quality and grade slippage of the coal supplied to power utilities in their
power plants  Flexibility in Utilization of Domestic Coal In order to achieve
flexibility in utilization of domestic coal for reducing the cost of power
generation, the proposal for allowing flexibility in utilization of domestic
coal was approved by the Cabinet on Under the scheme, the Annual Contracted
Quantity (ACQ) of each individual coal linkage as per Fuel Supply Agreement is
to be aggregated as consolidated ACQ for each State and Company owning Central
Generating Stations instead of individual generating COAL REQUIREMENT  10
Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan station The
State/Central Gencos would have flexibility to utilize their coal in most
efficient and cost effective manner in their own power plants as well as by
transferring coal to other State/Central Gencos Power plants for generation of
cheaper power The States may also transfer coal to efficient IPPs selected
through -Bidding process Ministry of Power/Central Electricity Authority in
consultation with all the Stake holders has prepared and issued the methodology
for flexibility in utilization of domestic coal Supplementary agreements have
been signed by power utilities for aggregation of ACQ with coal subsidiaries/CIL
The flexibility in utilization of domestic coal will result in reduction of cost
of electricity to the consumers  COAL WASHERIES IN INDIA In India, 20 percent of
coal produced is washed as against  global average of 50 percent Coking coal
preparation has long been in operation in India but recently, the trend has been
shifted to washing of non-coking coal due to environmental and efficiency
concerns The long distance transportation of coal via land routes offer an ideal
opportunity for coal washing in India because of economic benefits Though coal
washery increases the overall cost of coal, but the benefits accrued in terms of
saving in transportation, & cost and efficiency are sustained Ministry of
Environment & Forests vide Notification  02(), dated January 02, 2014, has
amended Rules in respect of use of washed/ blended or beneficiated coal with ash
content not exceeding thirty-four percent on quarterly average basis in Thermal
Power Plants As per the amended rules, power plants located beyond 500 kms from
the pithead shall be supplied with and shall use raw or blended or beneficiated
coal with ash content not exceeding thirty-four percent on quarterly average
basis  5th June Ministry of Coal/CIL is required to take necessary action for
compliance of the above  LIGNITE Lignite reserves in the country have been
estimated at around Billion tonnes, most of which is found in the State of Tamil
Nadu About 82 % of the Lignite reserves are located in the State of Tamil Nadu &
Pondicherry At present only  small percentage of the total reserves of lignite
have been exploited Considerable scope remains for the exploitation of the

Electricity Plan CHAPTER-10 KEY INPUTS INTRODUCTION Timely availability of all
key inputs - as per the schedule of requirement of the individual power
projects, is vital for successful implementation of any Power Plant
Infrastructural support such as port facility, construction & manufacturing
capabilities specifically erection machinery and erection agencies including
civil and BOP contractors are also of utmost importance This Chapter therefore
examines the availability of following key inputs –      Manufacturing
capacity for equipment Major Materials – Cement, Steel, Castings, Forgings,
Tubes & Pipes Transport – Railways and Ports Gas pipelines including
regasification facilities Land and Water for Thermal stations Availability of
other inputs like Fuel, Funds and Man-power have been dealt in separate chapters
The estimation of materials has been made based on the estimates already
available for the past plan (NEP-2012) with suitable changes/modifications for
large supercritical units and latest manufacturing trends indicated by the
manufacturers Inputs for Cement and other materials for nuclear projects have
been considered at 130% of the requirement of coal based projects based on the
assessment of Nuclear Power Corporation (NPCIL) for NEP-Inputs for hydro
projects have been retained from the NEP-Availability of transportation has been
estimated based on the issues/constraints identified in the previous Plan and
the developments and policy initiatives brought out by various Ministries during
the deliberations Suggestions for further improvements have also been indicated
based on the inputs received during the deliberations from the manufacturers and
utilities Major share of capacity addition during the coming years is planned
through renewable sources like solar and wind As the inputs required for the
renewables stations are substantially different from those for conventional
stations, these have been covered as  separate sub-section CAPACITY ADDITION

addition may be required during  AVAILABILITY OF EQUIPMENT  Main plant equipment
As has been decided by the Ministry of Power that entire coal based capacity
addition during the years  and subsequent Plan periods shall be through
supercritical units Requisite indigenous manufacturing capacity for manufacture
of super-critical units is considered vital to ensure lifetime support for
services and spares, specific problem KEY INPUTS Central Electricity Authority
National Electricity Plan solving and customization for trouble free operation
of these units in the Indian conditions As  result of the efforts made by the
Government over the last decade for creating indigenous manufacturing capacity
for supercritical units, BHEL entered into technology collaborations and several
joint ventures by the International manufacturers were set up for indigenous
manufacturing of supercritical main plant equipment Encouraged by the bulk
orders awarded by the Government with mandatory Phased Manufacturing Programme
provisions, most joint ventures are under advanced stage of completion of the
manufacturing facilities and have also started rolling out components/sub-
assemblies etc from their manufacturing facilities The indigenous manufacturing
capacity for supercritical main plant equipment likely to be available from BHEL
and the JVs are given in Table  Table- Indigenous manufacturing capacity for
Supercritical equipment (Capacity MW/year) Turbine- generator 13,500 ,000 ,000

(Toshiba-JSW Power System) Thermax-Babcock & Wilcox Doosan Power Systems India
Pvt Ltd Total 13,500 ,000 - - ,000 ,200 22,700 Thus, adequate indigenous
manufacturing capacity of supercritical main plant equipment is available in the
country Most manufacturers do not have requisite orders and have expressed
concerns on lack of orders Indigenous manufacturing capacity for hydro and
nuclear stations also exists in the country Indigenous manufacturing capacity
for Gas Turbines/combined cycle stations is also available in the country and
large sized Gas Turbines including advanced class are being manufactured by BHEL
Balance of Plant (BoP) equipment Balance of Plant systems such as Coal Handling
Plant, Ash Handling Plant, Water Treatment / DM Plant, Cooling Towers, CW
System, Chimney, electrical systems and switchyard etc were identified as
critical items for timely commissioning of thermal power projects in the 12th
Plan and several measures like standardisation of BoP systems, reviewing the
qualifying requirements to ensure quality vendors and large vendors for faster
execution of projects, mandating  central organization to maintain  dynamic data
base with regard to BOP orders were suggested The above issues have been largely
addressed and in the 12th Plan generally no constraints/delays on account of BoP
have been faced However, off-late, constraints in availability of good BoP
systems vendors are being felt as many of the good Coal Handling Plant/Ash
handling plant vendors are not in good financial health Even in the EPC
contracts, the EPC agency normally sub-contracts BoP systems or procures these
as bought out items and thus availability of good BoP vendors is vital for all
projects NTPC brought out that, due to lack of good contracting agencies in Coal
Handling Plants(CHP) & Ash handling Plants (AHP) with good financial health,
works get affected in these areas and NTPC is required to make lot of efforts in
making available supplies and making these systems ready to match with the
commissioning requirement In several cases, NTPC had to terminate the contracts
awarded due to non-performance of the vendors – like Ash handling plant system
at Solapur, VSTPP-IV and Barh- projects and coal handling plant at Kanti TPS The
major reasons identified for poor performance of the agencies are as under: 
Agencies have taken works beyond their capacities and are not able to mobilize
the resources to meet the commissioning targets KEY INPUTS Central Electricity
Authority National Electricity Plan  Cash flow problems / financial crunch of
agencies  Many  times, works taken at lower prices but not able to sustain
during execution In such cases where constraints are felt by BoP vendors or
where contract have been terminated, NTPC has adopted the following action Plan
for completing the projects: -  Taking materials through sub-vendors by giving
comfort letters and making direct payments to sub-vendors  Direct payments to
sub-agencies working at sites to ensure that regular payments to the labourers
working at site  Hiring cranes and other &Ps and providing these, to the
agencies on chargeable basis BoP systems in power stations are generally
material handling systems which are common to several other large industries
like cement, steel etc and vendors are operating across number of such
industries Some main plant equipment/EPC contractors have also reported that BoP
vendors and civil contractors prefer “Non-Power” works Thus,  long term solution
for ensuring requisite availability of good BoP vendors needs to be found The
NEP-2012 had suggested mandating  central organization to maintain  dynamic data
base with regard to BOP orders and their liquidation Considering the constraints
being faced by the power sector, it is felt that such an organizational
mechanism for information sharing on BoP vendors across industries needs to be
considered Such  mechanism could provide the following salient details: -   web
based portal for sharing all information relating to BoP vendors viz orders at
hand, their implementation status etc orders completed, feedback of the
customers so that project developers can take informed decisions  Availability
of & and trained Skilled/Semi-skilled man power available with the vendor  In
second phase the BoP vendors and Construction agencies could be rated based on
their performance It is also felt that new advanced technologies BoP systems
like High Concentration Slurry Disposal (HCSD) type ash disposal systems, closed
pipe type conveyers for coal handling plants (CHP), large size  systems would be
required, and requisite capacity for implementation of these systems and also
indigenous manufacturing of key equipment for such systems should be developed
AVAILABILITY OF KEY MATERIALS Availability of the following key materials has
been assessed for thermal, hydro and Nuclear capacity addition planned: - 
Steel - Structural Steel and Reinforcement steel  Cement  Aluminum  Boiler
Tubes & Pipes  Thicker Boiler Quality Plates  Castings & Forgings for Turbo-
Generators (TG) Sets As has been brought out, the estimation of materials for
thermal projects has been made based on the inputs received from the equipment
manufacturers - the norms adopted for estimation of material in the past plan
(NEP-2012) were reviewed by the manufacturers and modifications indicated have
been suitably incorporated Inputs for Cement and other materials for nuclear
projects have been considered at 130% of the requirement of coal based projects

may be seen from above, based on demand projections, the coal based capacity
addition requirements during 2017- 22 comes out to be ,445 MW However, coal
based projects to the tune of about 47855 MW are already under construction and
are likely to get commissioned during 2017-Indigenous manufacturing facilities
for castings and forgings is available at BHEL Hardwar and with other
manufacturers like & and Bharat forge BHEL central forge and foundry plant
(CFFP) Haridwar have considerably augmented their capacity and are now
manufacturing castings and forgings for 660 MW units except for some KEY INPUTS
Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan special castings The
total capacity of castings and forgings for BHEL CFFP Haridwar is 10,000 tons
per annum & and Bharat forge also have world class casting and forging
capability & forge plant has capacity to produce large casting of up to 54 tons
– suitable for 660 MW units Thus BHEL and other indigenous manufacturers have
adequate indigenous capacity for castings and forgings However, the designs of
castings/forgings are specific to each manufacturer and manufacturers adopt
different designs, material composition etc based on their OEMs standard
practice Thus most manufacturers presently use imported castings/forgings The
equipment manufacturers have brought out that most of the tubes and plates are
required to be imported Tubes up to grade  20 are indigenously available and
beyond that tubes are imported Similarly, Carbon Steel pipes up to ” (200 Normal
Bore) size are available indigenously but beyond that are imported Alloy steel
pipes to ASTM grade  335 P91/P92 and thick walled carbon steel pipes to ASTM
grade A106 Gr  are imported due to lack of domestic availability Special
fittings, Critical valves like Control valves are not available indigenously
There is no indigenous capacity for manufacturing of thick boiler plates and
they are entirely imported SAIL has brought out that they are manufacturing only
electric resistance welded (ERW) tubes and are not manufacturing seamless tubes
required for boilers Besides, there is no indigenous capacity for manufacturing
of CRGO/CRNGO steels at present and these steels are imported During the
deliberations held with the manufacturers and ministry of steel in the meetings
of NEP sub-committee for key inputs, it was agreed by all that indigenous
manufacturing of critical steels and tubes and plates needs to be created
Ministry of steel/SAIL agreed to undertake & for indigenous development of
various special steels used in manufacturing of boilers and Turbine generators
It is suggested that  joint mechanism may be created under Ministry of Steel
with participation of power equipment manufacturers and steel manufacturers for
more information sharing on compositions/properties of various steels and steel
products required and their indigenous development by the steel industry RAIL
TRANSPORTATION Rail transportation is critical for movement of equipment as well
as coal to power stations The NEP-2012 and the 12th Plan working group on power
by the planning commission had stressed on  Creation of dedicated freight
corridors (DFC),  Augmentation of capacity to evacuate coal from major coal
fields namely North Karanpura, Ib Valley, Talcher and Mand Raigarh  Rail
connectivity to all ports having coal unloading facilities especially the minor
ports  Gauge conversion, new railway lines, electrification of new routes
Railways have indicated that, while Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) are being
pursued, parallel efforts are also being made for augmentation of Railway lines;
so as to overcome any constraints being felt in transportation Major railway
projects have been undertaken in Central & Eastern railway Also,  coordination
mechanism between Ministry of Power and Ministry of Railways exists for
identifying bottlenecks/priorities for transportation and based on the
assessment/discussions therein the Raipur - Titlagarh line has already been
advanced for commissioning in 2018 as against 2020 planned earlier Railways have
also been requested to ensure that no constraints are faced in North Karanpura
area where Coal India Ltd is coming with new mines and Coal from these mines as
well as from NTPC coal blocks in that area would be required to move to Central
region Regarding rail line connectivity for minor ports, Railways have brought
out that Ministry of Railways have taken  policy decision not to undertake any
fresh projects for connectivity to new/minor ports and all such projects for
port connectivity will be undertaken on PPP model where JVs would be formed by
the port developers; with Railways as 26 % equity partner Such an arrangement
would facilitate land acquisition for the lines by the Railways while also
ensuring requisite participation by the port developers Such  mechanism lowers
the financial burden of new projects on Railways, ensures commitment of the
other stakeholders (port developers etc) and also leads to benefits of Revenue
sharing to the Stakeholders KEY INPUTS Central Electricity Authority National
Electricity Plan The white paper2 brought out by Railways in Feb-2015, envisages
shelf of 154 New Line projects with total length of 17105 km at  projected cost
of ₹ 173,448 crores and 208 nos gauge conversion and doubling projects covering
18,976 km at  cost of ₹ 94,937 crores The shelf of projects has been categorised
with  view to providing focused attention and assured funding to various
categories With the present levels of funding, the prioritized projects may take
anywhere from  to 13 years to complete Thus many projects have been taken on
cost sharing basis with the industry – two such projects have been taken up with
Coal India and one with NTPC The Railways policy on participation of the private
sector in providing last mile connectivity to ports, large mines, cluster of
industries for building rail connectivity and capacity augmentation has proposed
the following five models: ) Non-Government private line model ii) Joint Venture
iii) Capacity augmentation through funding by customer iv) BOT ) Capacity
augmentation through annuity model All the models provide  clear revenue stream
to the investor for making the connectivity projects bankable Three Model
Concession Agreements for private line model, joint venture and BOT have been
approved and put in public domain The agreements for the other two models are
under approval process ROAD TRANSPORTATION Road transportation provides last
mile connectivity to the power projects in conjunction with other modes of
transportation like Railways and ports; while it is the sole mode for
transportation for large over dimension consignment (ODC) The NEP-2012 and the
12th Plan working group on power by the planning commission had stressed on: - 
Augmentation of Roads and Highways for transportation of Over Dimensioned
Consignments (ODC) for higher size units  Amendment in Motor Vehicle Act to
accommodate heavy consignments above 49 MT and inclusion of hydraulic axle
trailers  Review of load classification for Roads & Bridges by IRC/ MoRTH to
accommodate ODCs beyond 100 MT  Single window clearance and onetime payment for
ODC movement  Proper design of Toll Plazas built on highways  Changes in Road
design in North Eastern & Hill states to minimise sharp curves/gradients in
roads and have sufficient vertical clearance in underpasses  Proper Approach
Roads for Hydro Projects The issue of ODC movement is the most critical for
power projects However, the equipment manufacturers have indicated that despite
constant follow up for the last several years there has been no satisfactory
solution to the above mentioned issues With substantial number of state specific
clearances required at present, turn over time for lorries/demurrage goes up
considerably; and with limited availability of agencies for large ODC movements,
this leads to delays in transportation of critical items, leading to delays in
project execution Thus the issue needs to be addressed on priority Manufacturers
have given several suggestions like – adoption of standardized maximum axle
weight of around 16 MT/axle and no approvals should be required thereafter,
single window clearance system for ODCs as against case to case basis by
individual state authorities at present It has also been suggested that
National Bridge Up-gradation  Indian Railways –  white paper -  16/White_Paper-
_Englishpdf KEY INPUTS Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan
Programme may be taken up by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) in
partnership with Central & State authorities for upgradation of all bridges to
minimum strength facilitating ODC movements MoRTH have indicated that approval
of ODC on national highways has been made online It is seen from MoRTH website
that  system for online clearance for ODC movements is operational3 However, it
is seen that the online clearance pertains to only the bridges on National
Highways (NH) and there also it excludes bridges with span greater than 50 metre
Quote - The movement has been allowed on NHs and for bridges having span length
less than 50 metres except distress bridges (bridges which are unsafe for
carrying IRC loads as per Ministry' Circular no RWNH35072//2010S& () dated 20th
May ,The movement of bridges having span length >50 metres or bridges not
covered in Ministry' Circular noRWNH35072//2010S& () dated 24 shall be allowed
only after checking adequacy as per IRC:SP:37:2010 and completing the procedure
as per Circular dated 20th May,From  typical approval for BHEL Hyderabad to
Wanakbori TPS available on the MoRTH website, it is seen that there are
distressed bridges and 10 other bridges involved where no ODC movement is
permitted Also there are 11 bridges (10 special bridges and  bridge of span
greater than 50 metres) where ODC movement shall be allowed only after checking
adequacy and completing the procedure thereby implying specific clearance to be
sought Thus as has been brought out by the manufacturers such  system has little
utility as substantial specific clearances are required in spite of this online
system Thus the suggestion of manufacturers towards adoption of standardized
maximum axle weight of around 16 MT/axle and no approvals should be required
thereafter, single window clearance system for ODCs as against case to case
basis by individual state authorities at present or undertaking  National Bridge
Up-gradation Programme by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) in
partnership with Central & State authorities for upgradation of all bridges to
minimum strength facilitating ODC movements need to be seriously considered to
remove the constraints prevailing in ODC movements PORTS Ports are vital for
transportation of imported coal as well as equipment for the projects The
NEP-2012 and the 12th Plan working group on power by the planning commission had
stressed on the following for ports development: -  Adequate coal unloading
arrangement at Ports to handle imported and domestic coal  On the East Coast,
coal handling facilities to be augmented at Paradip and Vizag Ports to evacuate
coal from mines in Orissa as rail routes are congested  Mechanisation of all
major and important minor ports by augmenting crane capacities, silos, conveyors
& wagon tipplers Increasing draft at various ports to handle Panamax or capsize
vessels   Creation of RO-RO berths in at least two major ports namely Kandla
on the west coast and Paradip on the east coast for unloading ODCs  Road
connectivity to ports to handle ODCs has to be ensured Ministry of Shipping have
brought out that out of the 12 major ports in the country, six ports namely
Haldia, Paradip, Tuticorin, New Manglore are handling Coal and the present
capacity of these ports to handle the coal is 75 million tons/annum Also,
Ministry of Shipping has taken  policy decision that further augmentation of
capacity at the major ports would be done through PPP mode only The Ministry of
Shipping, Government of India has 12 Major Ports under the administrative
control of the Ministry viz Kolkata, Paradip, Visakhapatnam, Chennai, Kamarajar
Port (Ennore),   Chidambarnar (Tuticorin), New Mangalore, Mormugao, Cochin,
Mumbai, Kandla and Jawaharlal Nehru Port There are  Major Ports on the West
Coast of India   KEY INPUTS Central Electricity Authority National Electricity
Plan and  Major Ports on East Coast on India Besides, there are several minor
Ports which are not in the Scope of the Ministry and they come under the purview
of the State Governments The Major Ports have  total capacity of 52 million
tonnes as on 31st March, The Major Ports at Haldia Dock (Kolkata Port), Paradip,
Ennore,   Chidambarnar, New Mangalore and Mormugao have dedicated coal handling
facilities Further, the Port of Visakhapatnam also handles coal at multipurpose
berth The capacity of dedicated coal handling facilities is 56 million tonnes as
on The capacity augmentation projects at Major Ports are undertaken on Public
Private Partnership model (PPP) only where the private developers develop their
own jetties and handling, navigation and other facilities are provided by the
port authorities The Request for qualification process is initiated based on the
demand for cargo capacity for different category of cargo The qualified bidders
at RFQ stage are entitled to participate in RFP (Request for Proposal) with
revenue sharing model with the concerned Major Ports The model Concession
Agreement between PPP operator and the Port is signed with conditions for the
Project thereof Ministry of shipping has brought out that it may be necessary
for the Power Companies to enter into Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for
logistic Plan for evacuation of Thermal Coal Based on the MoU, the capacity with
development of berth is taken up by the concerned Port  copy of the procedure to
be followed for appraisal/approval of PPP projects in ports, notified by the
Central Government is placed at Annexure- INLAND WATERWAYS The following five
major river/canal systems have been declared as National Waterways4:-  Ganga -

transported through the waterway from time to time Transportation of POL
(petroleum, oil and lubricants) was also made through this waterway from Silghat
to Budge-Budge (West Bengal) and Baghmari (Bangladesh) iii Inland waterways can
be effectively used for Coal transportation as it is exerting  lot of pressure
on Indian Railways network; thus wherever feasible, transportation of coal
(particularly imported coal) using Inland Waterways can be looked into
beginning has already been made by NTPC for transportation of imported coal to
Farakka station through National Waterway- The transportation has already
started in Nov'13 and till 2015,  total of about  MMT imported coal has been
supplied to Farakka through this mode The salient details of the
mechanism/process employed are as under: -  NTPC executed  Tripartite Agreement
with Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) and selected the Operator As per
agreement, the Operator is required to: -  Unload and transport  MMTPA imported
coal from high seas (Sandheads/Kanika Sands – about 140 kms from Haldia) to
Farakka power plant ii Create the infrastructure from transfer point in mid sea
to NTPC coal stock yard including Transhipper, Barges, Unloading arrangement at
Farakka waterfront, Conveyor (about  km) from jetty to Farakka coal stockyard
iii Operate and maintain the project for  years from COD iv NTPC had given
commitment for transport of  MMTPA coal through inland waterway for  years from
COD  Entire investment for the project is to be made by the operator Payments
for the coal transported by the Operator is made by the Imported Coal Supplier
(ICS) appointed by NTPC time to time vi Material handling system at Farakka
shall be transferred to NTPC after  years of operation  IWAI is required to
ensure Least Available Depth (LAD) of   for minimum 330 days in  year and
navigational aids for round the clock operation The project commenced its
operation on 2013 and first set of 03 barges reached Farakka on 2013, carrying
approx 1500 MT each of imported coal  Several thermal power stations are
operational on the banks of Ganga in the States of West Bengal and Bihar Also
several more Thermal Power Stations are proposed/under construction in Bihar and
Uttar Pradesh Their coal requirement can be met through IWT Railways & Waterways
can jointly develop routes/ strategies for easing out movement of coal & power
equipment to the power projects LNG REGASIFICATION & PIPELINES FOR

RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS As brought out in Para-above, substantial capacity
addition is envisaged from renewables during  and 2022- MNRE was requested for
working out the norms for estimation of various inputs for renewables projects
based on solar, wind etc, their indigenous availability and issues involved in
transportation of equipment etc in consultation with the manufacturers of these
equipment and would be made available by MNRE separately 10 LAND AND WATER FOR
THERMAL STATIONS Land The land requirement for various configurations of thermal
plants is being considered as per CEA Report “Review of Land Requirement for
Thermal Power Station-2010” - the typical value for -unit combination of coal
based station based on domestic coal varies from 11 to 929 Acres/ MW for 500MW
unit to 800MW unit size and is approx 55 Acres/ MW for Coastal Stations based on
Imported Coal The same has been concurred by the members The 12th Plan working
group on Power by the Planning Commission had identified the following major
Issues of concern regarding land acquisition: -  Lack of land Records, Issues
related to compensation -Lack of clarity about the status of occupiers who are
not owners,  Right of Way (ROW) for Ash/Water pipelines, coal conveyors and
transmission lines, Resistance from local people,  MOEF clearance and
acquisition of forest land and Resettlement and rehabilitation of the Project
Affected People (PAP) The working group had recommended the following for Land
use and acquisition:  Minimizing land requirement pressure for new projects by
use of spare land within existing plants  Review of MoEF procedures for
expeditious project clearances  Higher capacity units in place of older small
size units & Adoption of higher size units  Shelf of sites for projects  land
bank needs to be created  New technology options to be adopted for minimizing
land requirement  Land acquisition by States need to be done expeditiously in
time bound manner, considering that  large percentage of power is allocated /
committed to the Home State from the power project KEY INPUTS 12 Central
Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan As no additional capacity
addition is envisaged from thermal projects during , and also large thermal
capacity is under construction, no major constraints are anticipated for thermal
generation on account of land availability Land for projects under construction
and recently awarded would already have been tied up However, issues faced in
general by the utilities for land acquisition were discussed by the Sub-
Committee and the major points emerged out of the discussions are as under: - 
Different types of land acquisitions are involved in Power plant construction
viz Land acquisition in contiguous land for Main Plant, Township, Ash dyke,
Reservoir etc (Pvt/ Govt/Forest), Linear land acquisition mainly for Railway
corridor Approach roads etc (Pvt/ Govt/Forest) and Right of Use/Right of Way
(RoU/RoW) for Municipal water pipeline/Ash pipe/Transmission line corridors 
With the enactment of new LARR act, apart from increase in input costs, the
process is getting more complicated and lengthy now Theoretically, almost  years
are required for completion of LA process that includes Social Impact Assessment
process/ consent of owners The problem is more in linear acquisitions wherein
number of PAPs and villages are more For NTPC’ Greenfield projects, viz
Gadarwara, Kudgi, Khargone, Lara, Meja, NPGCL, BRBCL, etc, problems are being
faced in acquisition of land for Railway Siding The reasons include rate
difference in the land acquired under old act / new act as awards for certain
patches were declared under old act, finalization of & Plan, incomplete land
records resulting to left out land in critical areas, etc Active support of the
state administration is essential for resolving such issues  possible solution
brought out by the members could be formation of JVs with Railways and land
acquisition by Railways under the Railway Act   While in general, acquisition
of forest land is avoided by the utilities/NTPC, difficulties are being faced in
transfer of forest land mainly in linear acquisitions – Rail line corridor at
Lara, Darlipalli projects of NTPC The major problem faced in transfer of Govt
land is GMK & GMA land and absence of pre-defined process of agreeable solution
for eviction of Raiyatis At times transfer of Govt land is becoming more
difficult than acquisition of Private land RoU (Right of Use) Act is available
in MP, Chattisgarh, Bihar, Gujarat and Haryana Due to absence of such act in
Maharashtra, Karnataka, UP and Odisha difficulties have been faced in
availability of land for laying of MuW pipelines in NTPC projects in respective
states – Solapur, Kudgi, Meja and Darlipalli Even in the states where RoU act is
available difficulties have been faced in availability of land (mostly on
account of owners’ demand of higher compensation) in BRBCL/ NPGCPL/Kanti/
Gadarwara projects of NTPC   Water As per Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986
(Amendment 1998) issued by MOE&, all thermal power plants, using water from
rivers/lakes reservoirs, are required to install cooling towers irrespective of
location and capacity Thus all thermal stations are being provided by closed
cycle cooling water (CCW) systems Over the years, considerable technology
improvements have been made to reduce water consumption in the stations - the
consumptive water requirement which used to be about 7m3/MWh in the past, has
been optimized by various technological interventions & water conservation
practices and has been brought down to 3m3/MWh As per the new environmental
Regulations issued by MOE& in Dec-2015, all new plants to be installed after 1st
January, 2017 shall be required to meet specific water consumption upto maximum
of  m3/MWh In view of the necessity to install FGD system in the stations due to
SOx emission limits prescribed in the new MOE& Regulations, higher consumption
water requirement of about  m3/MWh is estimated The 12th Plan working group on
Power by the Planning Commission had suggested for creation of large reservoirs/
dams on potential rivers to retain flood waters by the state Govts/Ministry of
water resources to ease water availability for the projects KEY INPUTS 13
Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan 11 CONSTRUCTION
MACHINERY The availability of construction machinery for project execution is
generally considered adequate However, as brought out earlier, contractors at
times take works beyond their capacities and are not able to mobilize the
resources and deploy adequate & items to meet the commissioning targets In the
above context,  suggestion has been made for creation of  mechanism for sharing
information on orders/work load on various contractors and availability of &
items/construction machinery with them Suggestions were also sought from the
equipment manufacturers on improvements in construction machinery and
construction practices to improve the pace of project execution The salient
issues emerged from the information provided by the manufacturers and
deliberations held in the Sub-Committee are as under: -  Better infrastructure
for transportation and ODC movement could facilitate larger size sub-assemblies
at shop, leading to reduction in execution time at sites This would also require
deployment of larger size cranes and handling equipment at site For bigger
modules, higher size cranes of about 1000 tons may be required at site Better
site infrastructure by the customer comprising of: -   Pre-assembly yards at
site with dedicated & – permitting boiler contractor for fabrication at site
could provide considerable reduction in the time of Construction For this, an
additional area of 70,000 sq would be required by the Contractor  Well
compacted and motorable area for storage of material  Hard crusting of Boiler
cavity and surrounding area for Crane Marching  Advancement of underground
portion of civil foundations in boiler area, depending upon Engineering and
interface input  Adoption of improved Construction Practices in Civil works
like: -  Using concrete batching plants instead of concrete mixers  Tower
Cranes and placer booms for concreting for standalone high rise buildings
instead of concrete pumps  Automatic plastering machines  Rebar Processing
Unit for Fabrication of Reinforcement Steel  Pre Engineered Buildings with
tubular sections with pocketed foundations It is suggested that  Task Force may
be created under NTPC with participation from equipment manufacturers/EPC
contractors to examine the issue in detail and work out an optimized framework
of site preparation, & requirements etc for overall improvement in project
execution 12 CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS The broad conclusions/recommendations
for key inputs are as under: -  Adequate manufacturing facilities exist for
main plant equipment– Lack or orders is  concern of all manufacturers 
Presently there are large imports of raw materials, castings/forgings,
tubes/pipes of alloy steels, CRGO steel etc for Boiler and Turbine generators It
is suggested that  joint mechanism may be created under Ministry of Steel with
participation from power equipment manufacturers and steel manufacturers for
more information sharing on compositions/properties of various steels and steel
products required and their indigenous development by the steel industry 
Constraints in availability of good BoP systems vendors are being felt as many
of the good Coal Handling Plant/Ash handling plant vendors are not in good
financial health Even the EPC agency normally sub-contracts BoP systems and thus
availability of good BoP vendors is vital for all projects – both, EPC or
separate package basis In several cases BoP contract had to be terminated due to
non-performance of the vendors As BoP vendors KEY INPUTS 14 Central Electricity
Authority National Electricity Plan cater to material handling systems in other
industries also, it is suggested that an organizational mechanism for
information sharing on BoP vendors across industries needs to be considered Such
mechanism could provide the salient details on orders in hand, & available, past
performance etc This could be  web based portal under DHI or Ministry of
commerce  New advanced technologies BoP systems like High Concentration Slurry
Disposal (HCSD) type ash disposal systems, closed pipe type conveyors for coal
handling plants (CHP), large size  systems also need to be indigenized The
equipment manufacturers may back integrate as some of them also have their BoP
or EPC setups or may undertake vendor developments  ODC movement Continues to
be  major constraint; though MoRTH have placed an online system for ODC
approval, it is seen that substantial specific clearances are required in spite
of this online system as large number of bridges – special bridges, bridges with
span >50 , distress bridges are not covered under online approval Thus the
suggestion of manufacturers towards adoption of standardized maximum axle weight
of around 16 MT/axle with no approvals required thereafter, single window
clearance system for ODCs or undertaking  National Bridge Up-gradation Programme
for upgradation of all bridges to minimum strength facilitating ODC movements
need to be considered to remove the constraints prevailing in ODC movements 
Inland waterways can become an attractive mode of transportation in conjunction
with Railways The success of NTPC coal transportation to Farakka could be
replicated across numerous other stations  The prevailing regasification
capacity for LNG in the country stands at about 21 Million metric tons per annum
(MMTPA) – further expansions are being planned by several players Also
additional 15,000 km, of gas pipelines are under construction for completion of
national Gas grid  Future Infrastructure Project in Railway line, Port
development will be done through PPP mode  Suggestions were sought from the
equipment manufacturers on improvements in construction machinery and
construction practices to improve the pace of project execution Several improved
construction practices and pre- requisites and corresponding infrastructural
issues have been brought out by the manufacturers It is suggested that  Task
Force may be created under NTPC with participation from equipment
manufacturers/EPC contractors and utilities to examine the issue in detail and
work out an optimized framework of site preparation, & requirements etc for
overall improvement in project execution KEY INPUTS 15 Central Electricity

capacity addition for the period  and  has been assessed in the Chapters  This
chapter estimates total fund requirement for this capacity addition The
requirement of funds assessed in this chapter does not include the funds
required for captive power plants and for & of existing power plants The
requirement of funds for transmission have been included in Volume-II of the
National Electricity Plan FUND REQUIREMENT FOR THE PERIOD   total capacity
addition of 58,384 MW from conventional sources has been envisaged for the
period , consisting of 47,855 MW of coal based power stations, 406 MW of gas
based power stations, ,823 MW of hydro power stations and ,300 MW of nuclear
stations Besides this, there has been  big thrust by the Government of India for
setting up renewable power generation capacity of ,75,000 MW by the year 2022,
out of which ,17,756 MW is expected to be set up during the period 2017-The
requirement of funds for generation projects for the period 2017- 2022 has been
assessed, based on the above mentioned capacity addition However, it may be
mentioned that no additional fund will be required for gas based generation
capacity as the construction of these plants has already been completed and
could not be commissioned so far due to non-availability of domestic gas To
assess the fund requirement for various types of generation projects, the year-
wise phasing of expenditure has been considered in accordance with the normal
scenario The cost per MW for the year  has been estimated based on present day
cost and this has further been escalated thereafter @% per annum However, in
view of the recent trend, the capital cost per MW in case of solar, wind and
biomass based power projects has been pegged at present day level without any
escalation in subsequent years The details of assumptions of capital cost per MW
and year-wise phasing of expenditure of different categories of generation
projects are given in Annexure and Annexure respectively Based on the above, the
total fund requirement for the period  is estimated to be Rs11,55,652 Crores,

INTRODUCTION The phenomenal growth in demand for energy is increasingly
affecting the natural environment Human activities now occur on  scale that has
started to interfere with complex natural systems Anthropogenic activities such
as energy generation from fossil fuels, industrialization and deforestation have
been increasing the atmospheric concentration of Green House Gases (GHGs) above
their natural levels resulting in Global climatic change Excessive concentration
of Green House Gases like Carbon di-oxide (CO2) and Methane (CH4) and other
harmful emissions in the atmosphere has become one of the most critical global
environment issues by which human life is gravely threatened In most of the
developing countries, the major requirement of power is met through thermal
power plants India also depends largely on coal as  major source of energy for
producing power and coal will continue to play  major role in producing power in
near future As on 2017, coal based power generation capacity is around 08 % of
the total installed capacity but generates almost 08 % of total power generation
in country Generation of power by use of fossil fuel like coal, oil and gas
pollutes the atmosphere in many ways Emission of particulate matter and
generation of fly ash from coal based power stations are local health hazard
Gaseous emissions from fossil fuel based power generation like CO2, SOx, NOx and
Mercury etc affect the local as well as global climate EMISSION FROM THERMAL
POWER STATIONS Fossil fuel-fired power plants burn fossil fuels like coal,
lignite, natural gas, diesel etc to generate steam/ hot air to run turbines
generating electricity The generation of power from combustion of fossil fuels
has an impact on Air, Water and Land resulting in degradation of local as well
as global environment The major types of pollutants emitted from thermal power
stations are as follows:  Air Pollution The following major air pollutants are
generated from combustion of fossil fuels by thermal power stations: ) Nitrogen
oxide(NO2) ii) Sulphur di-oxide (SO2) iii) Green House Gases like CO2 iv)
Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) ) Mercury Emissions Traces of Carbon monoxide
(CO) is also produced during the process of combustion The brief description of
major pollutants and their effects are detailed below:  Nitrogen Oxide Most of
the NOx is emitted as NO which is oxidised to NO2 in the atmosphere All
combustion processes at high temperature are sources of NOx emission Formation
of NOX may be due to thermal NOX which is the result of oxidation of nitrogen in
the air or due to fuel NOX which is due to nitrogen present in the fuel In
general, higher the combustion temperature the higher NOx is produced Some of
NOx is oxidised to NO3, an essential ingredient of acid precipitation and fog
There were no existing norms for control of NOx However, new norms notified by
Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has stipulated norms for NOx
control, which are discussed later in the chapter  Sulphur Oxide The combustion
of sulphur contained in the fossil fuels, especially coal and oil is the primary
source of SOX About 97% to 99% of SOX emitted from combustion sources is in the
form of Sulphur Di-oxide which is  critical pollutant, the remainder is mostly
SO3, which in the presence of atmospheric water is transformed into Sulphuric
Acid at higher concentrations, produce delirious effects on the respiratory
system The SOx emissions are controlled by providing tall EMISSIONS FROM POWER
SECTOR Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan height stack for
dispersion Higher size units of 500 MW and above were also required to keep
space provisions for future installation of Flue Gas de-sulphurisation (FGD)
system when required In specific cases, installation of FGD system has been
stipulated by MOE& while granting environmental clearance The new norms notified
by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has stipulated emission
norms for SOx which are discussed later in the chapter  Green House Gases
number of gases like CO2, Methane, nitrous oxide(N2O), Chlorofluorocarbons and
water vapour are called Green House Gases Carbon dioxide is released primarily
through the burning of fossil fuels It is generated by combustion of coal and
hydrocarbons Methane is released through the decomposition of organic matter
(marshes, cattle raising, rice flakes etc) and the use of fossil fuels
Particulate Matter The terms particulate matter, particulates, particles are
used interchangeably and all refer to finely divided solids dispersed in the air
through chimney or stack of power stations Norms have been stipulated by
Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for control of Suspended
Particulate Matter and are more stringent for new power plants  Carbon Monoxide
It is  colorless, odorless flammable and toxic gas It has ability to react with
hemoglobin in the blood and reduce the oxygen absorbing capacity of the blood It
is generated by incomplete combustion of coal and hydrocarbons The most
significant source of CO is automobiles  Mercury Emissions Emissions of mercury
from thermal power stations are  subject of increasing concern because of its
toxicity, volatility, persistence, long range transport in the atmosphere Once
released into the environment, mercury contaminates soil, air, surface and
ground water The mercury emitted from coal-fired power plants originates from
the mercury present in the coal Typically, mercury is present in the coal in the
tens of parts-per-billion range Burning of enormous quantity of coal for power
generation makes it the largest anthropogenic source of mercury emissions  Water
Pollution Water pollution refers to contamination of natural water, whereby its
further use is impaired The contamination could be caused by the introduction of
organic or inorganic substances in the water or due to change in the temperature
of the water In thermal power stations the source of water is river, lake, pond
or sea from where water is usually taken There is possibility of water being
contaminated from the source itself Further contamination or pollution could be
added by the pollutants of thermal power plant waste as inorganic or organic
compounds The types of water pollution & its sources are given in Table
EMISSIONS FROM POWER SECTOR Central Electricity Authority National Electricity

depend on the type and concentration Some of these are given below in Table
Table Effects of Water Pollution Pollutants Soluble organic as represented by
BOD( Biological Oxygen Demand) Effects Deplete oxygen in surface water, Fish
killing, the growth of undesirable aquatic life and odours Certain organics can
be bio-magnified in the aquatic food chain Decrease hinder water photosynthesis,

thermal power stations to water bodies is made after treatment as per the
environmental standards prescribed by MOE& Further, ash ponds are High Density
Polyethylene (HDPE) lined to prevent leaching etc Also zero discharge system
with no discharge to water body are envisaged at many stations  Fly Ash
Generation Indian coal is of low grade with ash content of the order of 30%-50 %
in comparison to imported coals which have low ash content of the order of
10%-15% Large quantity of ash is thus being generated at coal/lignite based
Thermal Power Stations in the country, which not only requires large area of
precious land for its disposal but is also one of the sources EMISSIONS FROM
POWER SECTOR Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan of
pollution of both air and water To reduce the requirement of land for disposal
of fly ash in ash ponds and to address the problem of pollution caused by fly
ash, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change has issued various
Notifications on fly ash utilization, first Notification was issued on 14th
September, 1999 which was subsequently amended in 2003, 2009 and 2016 vide
Notifications dated 27th August, 2003, 3rd November, 2009 and 25th January, 2016
respectively The Notification of 3rd November, 2009 prescribes targets of Fly
Ash utilization in  phased manner for all Coal/Lignite based Thermal Power
Stations in the country so as to achieve 100% utilization of fly ash The latest
MoEF&CC’ Notification of 25th January, 2016 stipulates mandatory use of fly ash
based products in all Government schemes or programmes  Pradhan Mantri Gramin
Sadak Yojana, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005,
Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, etc  Land Degradation The thermal power stations are
generally located on the non-forest land and do not involve much Resettlement
and Rehabilitation problems However, it' effects due to stack emission etc, on
flora and fauna, wild life sanctuaries and human life etc have to be studied for
any adverse effects One of the serious effects of thermal power stations is land
requirement for ash disposal and hazardous elements’ percolation to ground water
through ash disposal in ash ponds STEPS TAKEN BY THERMAL POWER STATIONS TO
REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS Following steps are presently being taken by
power utilities to reduce the pollution from thermal power stations: -  SPM
Emissions: - High Efficiency Electrostatics Precipitators (ESP) are installed in
the power station to arrest fly ash and reduce suspended particulate matter
within the prescribed emissions norms  SPM norm stipulated by MOEF& CC are
generally adhered to by coal based power stations However, depending upon the
local condition, Pollution Control Board or other implementing agencies within
the provision of Environment Protection Act has stiputed more stringent norms
NOx Control:- Low NOX burners are being used in the power station for NOx
control through primary combustion control The existing NOx emissions from coal
based power station without having any secondary NOx control system is in the
range of 600-1000mg/Nm3 SOx control – Indian coal used in the thermal power
station generally has low sulphur content about % to % and SOx control is being
achieved through dispersion from tall stacks provided as per the Regulations
prescribed In coal based units of 500MW and above and also at stations with
capacity of 1500 to 2000MW, space provisions are required to be kept for
installation of Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD), if required, in future In
sensitive areas, the installation of FGD plants may be insisted upon by MOEF&CC
even for station with smaller capacity Flue gas desulphurization systems have
been installed in few stations; wherever prescribed by the MOEF&CC    Liquid
Effluent Discharge: - Effluent Treatment Plant is being installed to control
parameters like pH, Free available Chlorine Suspended solids, Oil & Grease,
Copper, Iron, Zinc, TDS & Total Suspended Solids Many power stations have
achieved zero liquid discharge Most of the power plants are adhering to the
norms stiputed  Fly Ash Utilization: - The steps have been taken by Thermal
Power Stations to ensure 100% utilization of ash generated by them The Fly ash
collected in the dry form is being used for brick making, coal mines
backfilling, road construction and cement manufacturing Data of 151 coal based
thermal stations, with an Installed capacity of 80 MW, consuming coal of 64
Million tonnes and generating Fly Ash of 74 Million tonnes were analysed in  by
CEA The analysis shows that country has achieved Fly Ash Utilization of 77
Million tonnes with percentage utilization of 97 % (However, the actual
utilization of fly ash may vary from station to station) Fly ash utilisation in

protect human health & environment from adverse effects of Mercury in September
Article  of the Minimata convention pertains to reducing mercury emissions to
the atmosphere through measures to control mercury emissions from coal based
power stations The studies carried out by CIMFR, Dhanbad on mercury content in
Indian coal has estimated mercury emission factor of coal as 14 /tonne or 14ppm
Control systems provided for NOx and SOx (SCR and FGD) along with ESP also offer
the co-benefit of mercury emissions control NEW EMISSION STANDARDS FOR THERMAL

POWER SECTOR The new norms stipulated by MOEF & CC cannot be met until new
technologies like Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGDs) for SOx reduction and
Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCRs) for NOx reductions are introduced EMISSIONS
FROM POWER SECTOR Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan The
following technologies are available to reduce SOx emissions from coal based
power stations: ) Wet /Lime Stone Flue Gas Desulfurization ) Spray Dry Scrubber
) Sea Water Scrubbing The following technologies are available to reduce NOx
emissions from coal based power stations: ) Combustion control ) Selective
Catalyst Reduction (SCR) ) Selective Non Catalyst Reduction (SNCR) To meet the
new norms for SOx and NOX reduction, coal based power stations will face lot of
challenges Some of the issues and challenges are discussed below For
implementing SOx reduction, coal based power stations have to install flue gas
desulfurization plants It is estimated that around 16,789 MW of the coal based
capacity will be affected due to non-availability of space for installing FGD
plant  land of  acres is required to install FGD plant for  plant of ×500 MW
Also where space is available, FGD installation may require -  years for
installation and involve  shutdown of at least - months In addition to this, for
an installed capacity of around  lakh MW,  large amount of limestone will be
needed for operating FGD plants The by-product of FGD plants is Gypsum So the
disposal of such large quantity of Gypsum will be an added problem Installing of
FGD plant shall increase the Auxiliary Power Consumption (APC) by at least % –
% affecting the overall Efficiency of the power plant For implementing NOx
control, coal based power stations have to install Selective Catalytic Reduction
(SCR) as combustion control system may reduce the NOx emissions to around
mg/NM3 only However, in view of the new norms of 300 mg/NM3, installation of SCR
becomes must The main challenge with SCR is that they have not been proven for
high ash Indian Coal Also space constraint/layout constraints is also expected
to be  major challenge for installation of SCR Also for operating SCR, large
amount of Ammonia will be required involving challenges in transportation and
storage of Ammonia due its toxic nature Apart from all the issues and
challenges, availability of vendors to supply FGD and SCR in such  large
quantity will be the main constraint CARBON EMISSIONS FROM POWER SECTOR The
world over consumption of fossil fuel is the primary contributing factor in the
build-up of atmospheric concentration of GHGs like carbon dioxide resulting in
Global warming As per UN Human Development Report 2015, the per capita carbon
dioxide emission in India is among the lowest and is estimated to be around
metric tonnes as compared to the world average of  tonnes per capita and tonnes
per capita for USA (Table ) Table Per capita emission of CO2 of different

SECTOR INTRODUCTION Research and Development in power sector of India is managed
under Ministry of Power through three schemes namely In-house Research and
Development (IHRD) of CPRI, Research Scheme on Power (RSoP) and & under National
Perspective Plan (NPP) & is also undertaken by various ministries like MNRE,
Department of Science & Technology, & laboratories of CSIR , Academia (IITs,
NITs and Engineering Colleges) and by CPSU’ BHEL, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, POWERGRID
Private sector companies, global & centers, etc also pursue it significantly
Many technological aspects, which are proposed for adoption in the country, are
new from the perspective of Indian Power Sector This includes the large
capacities of superconducting generators, High Temperature Superconducting (HTS)
power apparatus, Ultra/Extra high voltage transmission lines and its connected
equipment, Gas Insulated Substation (GIS) as well as smart metering in
distribution systems & activities and infrastructure developed by CPSUs, CPRI
and MNRE during 12th plan were reviewed and projects which are important but
could not be taken up under 12th plan are proposed for consideration during the
year 2017-The following new developments have taken place in the last decade: 
Adoption of Supercritical technologies for thermal generation with large units
of 660 MW and 800 MW capacity  Technology for Ultra High Voltage transmission
of 800 kV DC, 1200 kV AC have been adopted Some of the transmission lines of
1200 kV AC are in the process of being commissioned  There has been  greater
emphasis on renewable sources of energy and Government of India has set  target
of 175 GW generation capacity by 2022 consist of 100 GW from solar 60 GW from
wind and 15 GW from small hydro and other renewable sources of energy These
developments have given rise to new challenges and issues in the power sector
Some of these include:    Transmission corridor for evacuation of power
generated from renewable sources  Microgrid and electricity solutions for remote
isolated areas  Adoption of micro grids and smart grids particularly in relation
to efficiency of operation as well as to deal with the consumer related issues
is very crucial for further development of Indian Power Sector The adoption of
large capacity generating units and high voltage transmission lines necessitated
the adoption of state-of-the-art technology of high capacity transformers as
well as grid safety, security and energy conservation Integration of renewable
energy generating sources with the Grid Impact of renewable energy generation on
the existing and new coal fed generating stations & CHALLENGES DURING  AND
BEYOND It is  known fact that technology can help in enhancing supply of energy
at affordable price and deliver it efficiently, sustainably and reliably The
supply should be reliable with high degree of availability However, the real
challenge lies in creation of  conducive environment for & to flourish The
country so far has been in the fore front of technology deployment but not in
development Hence,  proactive policy approach for technology induction must be
in place The in-house & arms of major CPSUs like NTPC, NHPC and POWERGRID aim at
introduction and absorption of new technology by applied research primarily
through project routes Major manufacturers like BHEL, ABB, GE etc, have their
own & set up, focusing on product development Central Power Research Institute
(CPRI) is provided with capital funds from the Ministry of Power for in-house
research as well as funds to coordinate and manage MoP’ research schemes Central
Electricity Authority (CEA) has to promote research in matters affecting the
generation, transmission, distribution and trading of electricity The policy of
the Government is to promote & projects which would help the nation to become
self-reliant in technology Funds are also earmarked under different schemes
including the Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyothi Yojana (DDUGJY) for enabling
investigations and technology development Research and Development in power
sector and consequent changes have resulted in the development of  sound
generation base,  reliable grid and  modern distribution system Continued and
sustained efforts are required through  &  ACTIVITIES IN POWER SECTOR Central
Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan involvement of various science
and technology laboratories like that of CPRI, CSIR, DRDO, BARC and cooperation
from Government bodies like DST, DSIR and MNRE, for promoting technology in
India In the present scenario, it is proposed to categorize & initiatives into
five different conventional sectors, viz Generation, Transmission, Distribution,
Environment and Renewables including Microgrid & is  continuous activity
Integration of several technologies with techno-economic, statutory compliance
and environmental considerations to be achieved over  long term scenario also
plays role in deployment of  particular technology Utilities work in competitive
and regulated environment and adoption of technology depends on that also &
INITIATIVES OF GENERATION SECTOR The major challenge to the energy and power
sector is to reduce and ultimately eliminate generation shortfall, to provide
reliable and cost-effective power supply to the customers, and to achieve it in
sustainable manner with minimum impact on the environment Generation sector is
in the midst of  paradigm shift – one which has never been seen before in India
Moreover, the renewable energy plants have been classified as ‘must run’ plants
Also, most of the fossil fired plants are forced to operate at part load for
sustained period We have also moved progressively from coal shortage era to
imported coal regime and now to coal surplus period All these indicate that we
are at the cusp of  new age where India will have to devise technologies and
strategies to extract maximum benefit from renewable as well as conventional
plants in  sustainable manner Though solar, wind and other sources of renewable
energy have recently received much publicity; still the role of conventional
generation continues to be critical Solar and wind power are distributed sources
which cannot be built at very high capacity levels or be centrally controlled
Moreover, they are dependent on weather conditions like wind levels and solar
insolation, and so they may be unavailable for certain periods at  stretch and
during this period, dependence would be exclusively on conventional power
generating sources Hence, huge opportunities to improve the generation system,
including the aspects like better plant design, increasing efficiency,
improvement in fuel quality and waste heat recovery system exist The following
are different technologies with proposed prototypes and pilot plant
demonstration for implementation:  Thermal Generation Some of the important
areas of & in Thermal generation are identified for collaborative &  Ultra Super
Critical (USC) and Advanced- USC Plants Ultra super-critical plants operate at
higher temperature and pressure (approximately 600° and 32 MPa) resulting in
higher efficiency These plants require low coal usage per kWh of electricity
generated and have less CO2 emissions  few such plants have been built in Europe
and Japan The efficiency of these plants goes up to 44% However, the extreme
operating parameters impose stringent requirements on materials Considering that
coal shall remain as the mainstay of India' power industry and the inevitability
of global pressure, India should seriously focus to reduce emissions due to its
own as well as global climate concerns Development of Advanced Ultra
Supercritical (Adv-USC) Technology for power plants has been taken as one of the
four Sub-Missions as part of the National Mission under the guidance of the
Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India Under this initiative,
it is proposed to develop and establish 800 MW Adv-USC Power Plant on  Mission
Mode, as  collaborative project involving Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic
Research (IGCAR), NTPC, BHEL and CPRI Material degradation issues and condition
assessment programmes are also to be investigated Research to increase the steam
parameter to 700° from the level of 600° and to increase the efficiency levels
beyond 40% needs to be explored The research in this area for the development of
suitable materials to handle high temperature is already being coordinated by
Government of India with the participation from BHEL, Nuclear Power Corporation
Limited (NPCIL) and few experts in the country  IGCC Technology  &  ACTIVITIES
IN POWER SECTOR Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan
Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) integrates  coal gasifier,  gas
clean up system and gas turbine in  combined cycle mode where coal is gasified
with either oxygen or air The resulting synthesized gas (or syngas) consisting
of primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide is cooled, cleaned and fired in  gas
turbine The technology has shown capability of power generation at higher
efficiency and lower emission levels with respect to pulverized coal combustion
technologies as demonstrated in the USA, Netherland and Spain The other
important aspect of IGCC where technological advances are continuously made is
the syngas cleaning especially at higher temperature This removes the efficiency
penalty of cooling the syngas to ~90ºC and again heating it to the required
temperature for the gas turbine These demonstration plants should have
sufficient slip stream facilities where the upcoming warm gas cleaning
technologies can be tested at actual operating condition Furthermore, IGCC
technology opens up new product area along with electricity generation like
liquid fuel generation, hydrogen production, pre-combustion CO2 capture and
integration of fuel cell which may provide future options of zero emission coal
technologies with higher efficiency There is  need to continue funding of such
research with active participation of NTPC, BHEL and the leading State
generation utilities  Waste Heat Recovery Systems for enhancing the power plant
efficiency The thermal power plants operating on Rankine power cycle normally
achieve power generation efficiency in the range of 35–40% depending on various
site conditions, turbine inlet steam conditions and design of equipment etc
Balance of the heat input is essentially lost as condenser losses (about 48–50%)
and boiler exhaust gas losses (about –%) besides other nominal losses viz
radiation losses, un-burnt carbon losses etc In  500 MW unit, about 25 MW of
thermal heat would be available if the flue gas temperature is dropped, say,
from 140° to 110° The major challenge in low temperature heat recovery system is
the requirement of large heat transfer area and thus additional pressure drops,
which increases the cost of the system Use of waste heat recovery system, though
desired for obvious cost benefits, is equally important for environmental
protection since lower quantity of fossil fuels shall be burnt for same quantum
of useful energy Efforts are being made in developing technologies where waste
heat can be gainfully recovered and applied to: () Produce refrigeration / air-
conditioning using Vapor Absorption/Adsorption Machines based on Li–Br, Ammonia
absorption system (ii) Plant cycle efficiency improvement using condensate pre-
heating and fuel oil heating (iii) Produce electric power independent of the
main plant Turbine – Generator (TG) set using Aqua-Ammonia Cycle or Organic
Rankine Cycle (iv) Flue Gas Desalination of sea water () Flue Gas Cooling Tower
Blow down recovery  Bulk ash utilization Coal-based thermal power plants have
been  major source of power generation in India where about 61% of the total
power obtained is from coal-based thermal power plants (on installed capacity
basis) Fly Ash is  by-product material being generated by thermal power plants
from combustion of Pulverized coal High ash content is found to be in range of
30% to 50% in Indian coal So far several uses of fly ash have been developed viz
substitute of cement in concrete, land filling, mine filling, agriculture, etc
Practically fly ash consists of all the elements present in soil except organic
carbon and nitrogen Thus, it has  great potential material with manifold
advantages in agriculture Research needs to be carried out in developing
technologies for bulk utilizations of fly ash in other areas such as
construction of roads, bricks etc  Advanced surface engineering technologies for
higher life expectancy of Thermal plant components The surface engineering
technologies are becoming essential in critical applications of power plants
involving erosion as well as corrosion Thus the immediate technological
requirements to be addressed in respect of damage tolerance capacity of
materials are: () (ii) (iii) High temperature wear and erosion resistance of
thermal components (Burner, liner, and shield) Silt erosion resistance of hydro
parts Cavitation problem in hydro turbines The other important investigations
needed include the following:  &  ACTIVITIES IN POWER SECTOR Central Electricity

technologies  &  ACTIVITIES IN POWER SECTOR Central Electricity Authority
National Electricity Plan Transmission towers and conductors play major role in
power transfer To meet the growing demand for power in urban and industrial
areas requires transfer of huge quantum of power Due to the constraints in
getting environmental clearances, and acquiring Right of Way (RoW), introduction
of compact transmission lines is an alternative choice The compact transmission
lines have the advantage of reduced RoW and reduced tower dimensions The compact
lines invariably require polymer or long rod insulators for effecting reduced
dimensions of tower Reconductoring of existing lines with High temperature Low
sag (HTLS) conductor is  viable option to increase the power transfer capacity
Design aspects of compact towers and feasibility study of different types of
HTLS conductors are to be explored for implementation Compact transmission line
support using FRP is gaining importance and adopting compact transmission lines
in Indian power network has become essential due to increase in load growth and
difficulty in building new lines due to RoW issues The main features of compact
lines are reduced RoW and tower dimensions The compact lines have reduced
clearances and require polymer or long rod insulators for effecting tower
dimensions The aspects need to be addressed are: design, development and testing
of 220 kV and 400 kV towers and implementation in  utility as  pilot project
Keeping in view the bulk power transfer requirement development of high
temperature electrical conductors for transmission lines is essential The major
challenges are to overcome the transmission losses, increase the power
transmission on the existing lines and the development of more efficient power
conductors for new lines The development of efficient power transmission system
seems to have the major stake in the future of transmission system and will
become the national priority One of the major requirements of conductors is to
have high ampacity and low sag properties In this direction, high temperature
conductors which can withstand temperatures well above 250 ° are required to
meet the growing demand to transfer power Recent developments have demonstrated
that ‘6201’ and ‘Al59’ are the two major alloy conductors in use However,
further enhancement is possible by designing new alloys and economically viable
processing techniques The present alloy conductors use alloying elements such as
Zirconium (Zr) to restrict the re-crystallization temperatures of the alloy
conductors so that the conductor can withstand high temperatures The strength
and conductivity of conductors need to have  best compromise so as to get the
maximizing benefit during power transmission Research in developing high
temperature All Aluminium Alloy Conductors (AAAC) for transmission and
distribution line applications is needed specially for developing new materials
for this purpose The high temperature conductor should have an allowable
temperature of 300° in emergency condition and  ° in continuous operation Design
and development of seismic resistant substation is necessary to maintain
reliability and safety of electrical equipment after an earthquake This depends
on the seismic response of individual substation components such as transformer,
bushings, switchgear etc The use of seismic qualification of electric equipment
is one of the most cost effective methods for reducing the damage and
disruptions from earthquake Thus, equipment and supporting structures for power
generating stations, and substations located in seismically sensitive regions /
zones have to be designed and standardized to withstand possible earthquakes
UHV DC +/- 800 kV Considering the implementation of next High Voltage Direct
Current (HVDC) transmission at +/- 800 kV, indigenous manufacture of equipment
is required The research focus will cover the following aspects: () DC electric
field, corona studies on equipment and electrodes; () Effect of pollution on
insulator surface; selection of insulator profile, configuration to withstand DC
stress under normal and polluted conditions () Performance of bushings under DC
electric stress () Effects of DC stress on transformer insulation, ageing
studies, diagnostic tools () Overhead transmission Lines () Bushings and
transformers Some of the other potential areas of research are as follows:
Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based HVDC transmission has become an attractive
option for bulk power transfer between meshed grids The advantages of VSC based
HVDC transmission is: high controllability of active and reactive power at the
converters terminal and the ability to improve the system stability The project
envisages design, development and deployment of 50 MW VSC based back-to-back
HVDC system, as  pilot project study  &  ACTIVITIES IN POWER SECTOR Central

station ground in case the ground electrode path becomes isolated The
development of indigenous HSGS will be carried out as  pilot project study for
installation at HVDC substation The concept of transformer less HVDC
transmission is under active research at various institutions  pilot project
study is proposed to evaluate various aspects To adopt the VSC based HVDC
transmission technology, High Speed Grounding Switches for HVDC systems and to
absorb the concept of transformer less HVDC transmission system in power sector,
pilot project study is required to be undertaken to gain the experience for
wider acceptability and implementation  Design and development of equipment for
1200 kV UHV AC System Power sector growth necessitates development of indigenous
technology for absorption in to the network at higher voltage levels, mainly to
strengthen the system and power evacuation The key equipment proposed for
indigenous development are: 1200 kV sub-station, circuit breakers, shunt
reactors and controlled shunt reactors for dynamic reactive power compensation
Development of High Energy ZnO blocks for lightning arrestor is required for
dissipation of high energy Development of operating mechanism for 1200 kV
disconnector is essential in the light of UHV transmission system technology
HVDC and FACTS Efforts are needed for better utilization of the facilities that
have been installed in recent years System studies will be useful to evaluate
the cost-benefit trade-offs for further use of these devices The key
technologies that are being considered for development of controls, for EHV and
UHV AC and DC transmission systems are, compact towers that significantly reduce
RoW requirements, application of High Temperature Superconducting technology in
developing transformers, cables, fault current limiters, motors etc, Gas
Insulated Substations that require about 80% less area than conventional
substations, substation automation and remote operation systems The technical
developments in communication technology and measurement synchronization for
reliable voltage Phasor measurements have made the design of system wide
protection solution possible The introduction of Phasor Measurement Units (PMU)
has greatly improved the observability of power system dynamics Based on PMU’
input, different kinds of Wide Area Protection, emergency control and
optimization systems can be designed Additionally, Smart Grids to support
utilities in making optimal usage of the transmission grid capacity and to
prevent the spreading of disturbances are also being considered By providing on-
line information on stability and safety margins for dynamic condition
monitoring, Smart Grids would serve as an early warning system in case of
potential power system disturbances  Development of controllers for FACTS
devices Application of Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS)

HVDC, switchable shunt reactors, series and shunt HVDC taps, Unified Power Flow
Controller (UPFC), Interline-Power-Flow-Controller (IPFC) & Static Synchronous
Compensator (STATCOM) and deployment in network The controller performance is to
be studied in real time There is  need to develop controller for controlled
switching of circuit breakers, which is used to close or open the contacts of
circuit breaker by time dependent control of trip coils, to eliminate
undesirable transients Substantial research in this direction is required  &

benefits, support efficient delivery and investment in the electric system,
facilitate customer choice etc, on which exhaustive and heuristic analysis can
be done Using Data Analytics, it is becoming possible to run simulations or
models to predict the future outcome, rather than to simply provide backward
looking data about past interactions, and to do these predictions in real-time
to support each individual business action While this may require significant
changes to existing operational and Business Intelligence (BI) infrastructure,
the potential exists to unlock significant improvements in business results and
other success rates Next-generation Analytics can support BI search tools that
can find reports and generate Structured Query Language (SQL) queries, visual
discovery tools to slice/dice data intuitively at the speed of thought Data
analytics and tools can also be used for monitoring and improving the
performance of utilities and generating stations Some of the important topics

Distribution system has direct impact on the consumers It is also an area in
which there are significant challenges  large share of system losses occurs in
distribution circuits and  significant amount of power system investment goes in
the purchase and installation of distribution hardware Recently, the development
of smart grid concepts and the use of solar power have changed the way in which
distribution networks function The distribution sector requires most significant
priority since the efficiency, financial viability and losses effect the
viability of the total power sector as  whole Various privatization models
including franchising, Public Private Model, and others would need to be studied
and comprehensive recommendations may be made State wise The issues regarding
refinancing of the debt to save on the interest burden on the utilities,
bringing down the cost of procurement of power from outside the State need
consideration Hence & in distribution system needs impetus Distribution system
needs careful attention in the areas such as reduction in losses, metering,
distribution automation, planning, harmonic pollution, custom power devices,
Demand Side Management (DSM) etc High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) is an
effective method for reduction of technical losses and improved voltage profile
Application of IT has great potential in reducing technical and commercial
losses Integrated resource planning and demand side management also needs
special attention and implementation Substantial efforts are required for
capacity building, so that the present day distribution system would be
transformed into  modern day distribution system Smart grid represents  vision
for  digital upgrade of power distribution system to both optimize present
operation as well as to open up new avenues for alternative energy production
Improvement in reliability of distribution network can be achieved with
deployment of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition/Distribution Management
System (SCADA/DMS) for remote monitoring and control of various network
elements, obviating need for manned substations Distribution Management System
(DMS) extends the monitoring and control functionality of SCADA to distribution
transformers Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Fault Passage Indicators (FPIs)
are installed at substations Design Automation: Expertise is available for
manual design of distribution networks But it is  labor-intensive activity and
often results in non-standard and sub-optimal designs There is  strong need to
standardize and promote design automation techniques which would reduce costs
and improve performance Feeder Load Characteristics: Individual feeder loads
differ widely in their behavior  methodology needs to be evolved for studying
feeders in order to characterize them The technique should be relatively simple
and trade off accuracy against efforts involved, since any distribution entity
has  large number of feeders, and needs to accurately predict their
contributions to the total load curve for the next day, so as to contract for
energy supplies from generation companies  &  ACTIVITIES IN POWER SECTOR Central
Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan Appropriate tariff models: Along
with the usual charges based on monthly energy charges, it is possible to factor
in charges based on time-of-day (TOD) and the ratio of peak time energy to
average energy consumption This can have the effect of reducing the overhead of
the power sector infrastructure But detailed studies are needed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the scheme under typical Indian conditions, and to come up with
the most effective tariff structures Load Shedding: Currently load shedding is
generally carried out at the feeder level, with an entire feeder being
disconnected as  single entity With the facilities offered by smart grid, it is
possible to be more selective, and enable the system operator to shed non-
essential loads, while maintaining service to critical loads With this
flexibility, the system can be run more effectively, while critical loads having
assured supply, less dependency on stand by genets Detailed studies on this
aspect will be useful Security and Protection: In conventional distribution
schemes, loads are protected mainly through over-current relays and fuses  smart
grid has the facility to provide more sophisticated protection In addition, the
ability to operate the feeder through remote control opens up the possibility of
load control in response to under-frequency and voltage collapse conditions  &
in Solar Organic Polymer based Light Emitting Devices High power Silicon based
Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are gradually making large in-roads as common light
sources However, huge capital investment needed to manufacture LED and huge
breakeven point is  serious deterrent in this competitive world It is important
to note that incandescent, fluorescent and Compact Fluorescent Light (CFL)
sources have been popular for decades at lower wattages and metal halide and
sodium vapour lamps at higher wattages for large area lighting However, there is
scope for development of organic polymer based electroluminescent light sources,
which could compete with High power silicon based light emitting devices The
concept has been used and commercialized in some ways by leading manufacturers
for backlit lighting of mobile phones  Distribution Automation The research work
should be aimed at developing indigenous know-how of full scale Distribution
Automation system, which can cover from primary substations to consumer level
intelligent automation The future research initiatives for power distribution
automation are:  Customer Level Intelligent Automation System  Computer Aided
Monitoring and Control of Distribution Transformers  Substation and Feeder
Level Automation  Data communication system for Distribution Automation 
Development and Standardization of Distribution Automation software & IN
RENEWABLE ENERGY Hydrocarbon resource limits are bound to force the world away
from fossil fuels in coming decades In addition, the environmental and health
burdens arising out of the use of hydrocarbons may force mankind towards clean
energy systems Therefore, there is  need for electric power industry to look at
other technologies of power generation through solar, wind, biomass, small
hydro, fuel cells, geothermal, tidal etc Technologies related to wind, biomass,
solar, small hydro, geothermal, fuel cells, Waste to Energy (WtE) need to be
identified Research focus is on grid connectivity of large wind mills, self-
healing wind generation connected micro-grids, distributed generation and large
use of ethanol and hydrogen for energy products Development of micro and mini
grids and larger penetration of renewable energy is an important area of
research The & activities in the field of New and Renewable energy includes the

large wind systems as the technologies and their deployment are vastly different
14) Low wind speed turbine development (India has very few locations with high
wind speeds) 15) Development of low cost material for small wind turbine blades
and tower & in renewable energy includes different technologies which are listed
below: ) Integration of renewable energy with the power grid ) Cost of storage
in case of solar energy and wind power ) Bringing down the cost of solar PV
cells and wind power generation ) & issues of renewable energy generation )
Tackling with the End of Life of Solar PV modules The main areas of  &  in
renewable generation are:  Primary converter: developments for enhancement of
efficiency, cost reduction and new technology routes  Electrical energy
distribution and grid connectivity: conventional grid-renewable grid ties, micro
grids, domestic grid tied systems, etc  End use equipment for efficient
interface to renewable power  Research to bring down the cost of solar PV cells
as well as the storage batteries applicable for distributed generation system
especially in rural areas  Develop design principles of deciding on to the
capacity of battery systems  Recommendations regarding most appropriate
technology for hybridization of solar and wind power for meeting out the demand

may involve prime movers, generators, and power electronic controllers  Effect
on the conventional thermal power generator and any design modifications
required to cope up with the variable nature of solar and wind power and take
lessons from other developed countries like Germany/Japan These studies would
make recommendations for the following:  &  ACTIVITIES IN POWER SECTOR 11
Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan  Extent of backing down
on the conventional coal fired thermal generators and total number of such
operations during the life time of plant  Any changes required on the generator
in electrical insulation to cope up with such operations  Any changes required
of the materials of construction of turbine rotor blades, generator rotor,
insulation, etc, for future applications with greater induction of solar and
wind power & IN MICROGRIDS  Microgrid is  local energy grid with controlled
capability which means it can disconnect from the main grid and operate
autonomously The grid connects homes; business and other building to central
power resources which allow the use of appliances, heating/cooling systems and
electronics devices But this interconnectedness means that when part of the grid
needs to be repaired everyone is affected  Microgrid generally operates while
connected to the grid, but importantly it can break off and operate on its own
using local energy generation in time of crisis like storms or power outages or
for other reasons Microgrid can be powered by distributed generators, batteries
and renewable resources like solar panels Depending on how it is fueled and how
its requirements are managed,  Microgrid might run indefinitely Microgrid
connected to the grid at  Point of Common Coupling (PCC) that maintains voltage
at the same level as the main grid unless there is some sort of problem on the
grid or other reasons to disconnect  Microgrid not only provides backup for the
grid in case of emergencies but can also be used to cut energy costs or
connected to local resources that is too small or unreliable for traditional
grid use The microgrid allows communities to be more energy independent and
environmental friendly Microgrids can be described by one of four categories: 
Off grid Microgrids including islands, remote sites and other microgrid systems
not connected to local utility network  Campus Microgrids-That are fully
interconnected with  local utility grid but can also maintain some level of
service in isolation from the grid  Community Microgrids-Integrated into
utility network  Nanogrids- Comprise of smallest discrete network units with
the capability to operate independently  Impedance Emulator Switched impedances
are needed to correct power factor in Micro-grid systems In the case of switched
systems many inductors or capacitors are connected  solid-state equivalent of
motor generator (MG) set to test battery powered inverters is developed These
inverters (Equipment Under Test - EUT) are to be loaded with variable inductor,
capacitor, or even resistors However, to reduce the resistive losses and yet
maintain high power factor and low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) on the EUT,
novel system need to be developed, which is similar to an electronic Motor
Generator set This can also be deployed as  Pulse Width Modulated Power (PWMP)
factor correction system in micro grids It is well known that renewable energy
resources are distributed throughout the country Wind power is available in
southern and western parts, whereas solar power is available in north western,
central and northern parts of India Similarly, small hydel potential is
identified in the Himalayan and North-Eastern parts of the country Apart from
these renewable energy resources, biomass potential is also identified in few
Indian metro cities To meet the power demand of the country, in particular the
un-electrified rural Indian population from the sustainable energy resources in
reliable manner, the hybrid combination of conventional and non-conventional
resources in off grid and grid connected mode are potential power solution in
Indian context Tapping power from these resources and integration with the
national grid is  very challenging issue It involves delicate operation and
control, interfacing, storage, generation/load forecasting and regulatory issues
Even though in India, we have few simple micro-grid (having only one or two
resources) in operation, their application is mainly focused only on power
production and lacks research and development activities Therefore, there is
immediate requirement for renewable energy based micro grid as  reliable
solution for electrification of power isolated areaGovt of India has an
extensive plan to generate more green power from sustainable renewable energy
resources Therefore,  modern state of art micro grid research infra-structure is
highly required in India for carrying out extensive research in this area  &

Plan & IN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM Though the telecommunication sector initially
started with transmitting voice over wired lines the telecom companies have
diversified into multimedia, wireless communication etc in  big way Electrical
utilities have started finding benefits from advances in communication
technology People did try to develop Power Line Carrier Communication (PLCC)
separately riding purely on power lines itself But it failed due to impedance
offered by power network Power Grid is already planning to deploy fiber optic
cable network along the entire transmission system across the country It must be
noted that electrical network is one of the most widely dispersed networks along
the length and breadth of the country Alternatively, it is suggested that the
electrical utilities (transmission and distribution together) run fiber optic
cables along HT lines down to the ultimate consumers These cables could be laid
alongside HT cables and even on 11 kV lines and down to  phase LT lines along
the same cable, in the same trench, on the same pole and maintained by the
utility The utility uses it for its own data communication and could lease it to
cable operators for  fixed extra monthly income The Telecom Regulatory Authority
of India (TRAI) regulates bandwidth for wireless radio frequency and not for
fiber optic lines Utility can plan for laying underground pipes to carry both
power lines and also draw about 10 fiber optic lines in all new trenches TV,
computer network terminations should have fiber optic modem or set top box
interface modules- if not available, it should be developed indigenously This
will make the city/ town free from hanging wires, reduce road digging by
multiple entities and bring in discipline among utilities Microwave towers are
considered to pose health risks also by some Also many companies are working on
Light Based Field Interface (LIFI) as alternative to Wi-Fi LEDs can also be used
to carry signal information superimposed on its powering current Fluctuations in
lumen output will not be noticeable This is not possible with incandescent bulb
or metal halide or sodium vapour lamps as bandwidth is low & IN ENVIRONMENT The
need for electricity generation to be clean and safe has never been more obvious
Environmental and health consequences of electricity generation are important
issues, alongside the affordability of the power which is produced Production of
electricity from any form of primary energy has some environmental effect The
power sector in India is one of the largest emitters of CO2 The share of the
power sector CO2 emissions in the total CO2 emissions in India is higher than
the global average The main reason for such  high share is the power sector’
heavy reliance still on coal There are various technologies and processes that
have substantial potential to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emission Clean coal
technologies and renewable energy usage have been adopted by India as methods of
best approach to tackle climate change issues Along with all these methods,
further steps can be implemented for reduction of CO2 emissions These are
research and development; information and education (for awareness); economic
measures; regulatory measures; and voluntary agreements Each step offers
advantages and drawbacks and has different effects on CO2 reduction Low carbon
generation options, nuclear and renewable technologies, are needed to
substantially reduce emissions Due to the high ash content of Indian coal, oxy-
fueling and post combustion CO2 capture would be suitable options for India Pre
combustion capture in  coal fired IGCC plant would require the adaptation of the
technology to the Indian coal quality Retrofitting coal power plants with CO2
capture technologies could be an option to achieve clean coal technology
Developments of following technology ready methods are being tried: ) Use of CO2
for reduction in pH of ash water ) CO2 capture by Modified Amine Solution )
Development of Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) process for CO  capture and
conversion of CO2 into useful products PSA is  technology used for separation of
some gas species from  mixture of gases under pressure according to the species'
molecular characteristics and affinity for an adsorbent material Special
adsorptive materials ( Zeolite)  &  ACTIVITIES IN POWER SECTOR 13 Central
Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan are used as  molecular sieve,
preferentially adsorbing the target gas species at high pressure The process
then swings to low pressure to desorb the adsorbent material Clean environment
mechanism at thermal power stations, creating data base for ash quality,
advanced ash management schemes, sustaining coal based power generation
considering new and emerging environmental issues, effects of electromagnetic
(EM) waves on human beings with specific reference to up-gradation of
transmission voltages, eco-design and energy efficient power transformers,
development of waste water treatment & recycling technologies, emission control
technologies for NOx, SOx and mercury are some of the areas where & activities
are required for improvement of environment and for sustainable development

laboratories can also help in setting up of many Microgrid projects to exploit
the opportunities presented by renewable sources of energy These Centres can
supplement government programmes which are intended to provide 24   electric
power to all, especially in the rural sector Sufficient funds should be made
available for setting up of new Regional testing and Research laboratories for

than arbitrarily rating the country’ expertise and the experts in various areas
The upgradation of knowledge level through training could thus be more
structured and measured India’ key technical competence areas, the competence
level of various & organizations, the competence level of the experts, etc can
be documented for improvement purpose CPRI, CSIR, DRDO laboratories who are
involved in many & programmes, may benefit substantially by evaluating the core
competencies of the organization in various areas, and could be  scientific
basis for creation and monitoring of ‘Centres of Excellence’ in their identified
core competence areas This could be  national & mission project ‘Knowledge
Academy’ in the area of Electrical Power There is  great need to provide
‘reservoir and  continuous pipeline’ of qualified and competent technical and
scientific workforce in the area of electrical power There is urgency to create
‘CPRI Academy’ to provide structured courses on electrical power to fresh and
experienced engineers who will contribute to the technology base of the country
It may be like an autonomous University, providing basic level and advanced
level theoretical and practical courses to engineers With more and more
engineers opting to software related career, there is  great dearth of skilled
and practical electrical engineers in the country with adequate domain knowledge
Intellectual Property Right (IPR) Management Cells in National Level
Laboratories There is an urgent need to promote awareness related to IPRs
amongst the scientists and technologists An ‘IPR cell’ with IPR policies and
procedures need to be formulated to suit the need and purpose of the national &
organizations The IPR cell should be manned by experts who are skilled in
training the scientists of the organization, setting IPR targets, and
facilitating the innovation management of the organization Initiation of Mega
projects of disruptive technologies Disruptive technologies provide quantum jump
in the technology advancement All the breakthrough developments have happened
essentially through material / system developments There are very few & projects
of this category in the electrical power sector Mega projects like super
conductor based fault current limiters, and transformers have been in the
research mode for quite long, as also research in the field of combustion
process, gasification process, nano- technology, high temperature steels etc
CPRI could coordinate  well-planned mega research scheme in many of these areas
under NPP scheme of larger dimensions ‘Wireless power transmission’ is another
disruptive breakthrough & project to be initiated as collaborative project with
huge impact in the electrical power sector  &  ACTIVITIES IN POWER SECTOR 17
Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan Easing the Market entry
for newly / indigenously developed power products In the context of Power
Sector, many indigenously developed products, especially those involving
substantial developmental investment, face entry barrier in the form of
qualification requirements pertaining to equipment performance over  minimum
period specified by end users Though this has arisen out of genuine reliability
concerns of new products, this provides some inertia for indigenous development
Users’ interests can be safeguarded by the product developers by way of recourse
to deferred payments, extended guarantees or insurance cover to indemnify them
against the risk of failure Further, development of indigenous products must be
encouraged by providing an opportunity to the developers to carryout field
trials on no cost basis This has to be considered to promote national & efforts
There is  need for enunciation of  clear policy / guideline to provide
incentives for the commercialization of products developed through indigenous &
efforts The incentive could be among others, in the form of excise duty
exemption at least for  period of five years from the date of commercialization
Strengthening of the & Infrastructure & Infrastructure at National Level needs
strengthening in terms of facilities especially for type testing of prototypes
with  view to minimize development / commercialization cycle Many cases exist
where the customers prefer overseas test reports as sufficient facilities do not
exist in the country  national audit may be conducted through Industry and
utility forums to identify the gaps and efforts should be made to bridge the
gaps 10 & Mechanism Research and Development towards innovative technologies has
always been crucial for meeting future energy challenges The requirement and
capacity to apply sound tools in developing effective Research and Development
(&) strategies and programs is becoming increasingly important The need to
promote development and refinement of analytical approaches to energy technology
analysis, & priority setting and assessment of benefits from & activities has
become need of the hour Management of modern & is complex and it requires
discreet but multiple interface with academia, & institutions, government etc,
besides leveraging core strength of the organization Also, the & management
should be well structured In line with the aforesaid, following & strategy is
proposed to be adopted: 11 & Platforms Platforms to support international
cooperation and collaboration could increase the effectiveness of & investments
These include:  Technology transfer mechanisms;    Opening internships and
researcher exchanges with other countries;    Information sharing on both
technology and best practice; International support for demonstration projects
to improve the outlook for &; International exhibition of & equipment,
instruments, and materials; and Information sharing systems to collect and
disseminate information on renewable energy technologies International
collaboration can provide opportunities for information exchange, multiply the
benefits from & programs, including communicating best practices and lessons
learned 12 Policies for &  Developing integrated & plans based on  multi-
disciplinary approach  well-integrated & plan would ensure that proposed
programs are culturally appropriate, reflect current and planned resource
endowments, and involve communities in discussions of energy policy;  Removing
fossil fuel subsidies to balance the energy pricing mechanism in order to
attract or drive private capital to the energy industry;  &  ACTIVITIES IN POWER
SECTOR 18 Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan  Developing
skills and capacities to create  knowledge workforce leads to success of energy
efficiency programs, proper operation and maintenance of clean technologies; 
Providing as much certainty as possible concerning long-term (  to 10 years)
funding for &  Monitoring and evaluating & programs results to enable timely
adjustments to funding levels and strategies where necessary In addition to
subsidizing electricity through low tariffs, policy should support and subsidize
purchase of energy efficient appliances  13 Institutional and funding framework
for & Government should fund the & programme through schemes such as National
Perspective Plan (NPP) and Research Scheme on Power (RSoP) Some of them can be
in collaborative mode with participation from CPSUs, Industry and academic
institutes and utilities CPRI, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, Powergrid, DISCOMs, BHEL,
CSIR, CSIR laboratories, Government funded & Institutions, IITs, NITs may
execute the projects identified, which shall be coordinated and managed by CEA
and CPRI on behalf of MoP With  view to create & infrastructure and to establish
new facilities, augmentation of existing facilities and establishment of
regional testing laboratories in different parts of India is essential
Government should continue to support CPRI through capital grants The regional
laboratories of CPRI can help India’ small and medium Entrepreneurs to produce
globally competitive electrical products This will be  major initiative to boost
our “Make in India” programme Further Government should provide test and
evaluation facilities at subsidized and affordable rates to Indian Manufacturers
through Central Power Research Institute Policy to earmark  larger percentage of
profit after tax by PSUs as part of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) should
be considered to provide the much needed impetus to & in Power sector 12
RECOMMENDATIONS Followings are the important recommendations of this sub-group:
 Preparation of  well-defined & Vision and Policy document clearly highlighting
the & plan for the next decade and providing incentives for the
commercialization of products developed by indigenous & efforts of start-up
organizations based in India  Enhance Delegation of Power to & division to
improve the performance and delivery of the system  Development of  platform
for collaborative research involving Industries, Utilities, & organizations and
Academia both national and international levels to bridge the technology gaps,
strengthen expertise, and build synergy  Consideration of & projects of
national importance that require serious intellectual and financial resource as
Government National Mission projects with funding from  Creation of ecosystems
where MNCs, industry associations and professional societies may work in tandem
in different & Programs of the nation to compliment schemes like “Make in
India”, Start up India”, “Power for all” and help in creation of more jobs 
Creation of ‘National Registry of experts & expertise’ in various areas by
competence mapping  Creation of Centers of Excellence (CoE) in identified areas
to take up application oriented research projects  Establishment of ‘Power
Academy’ or ‘CPRI Academy’ to enhance the knowledge base of fresh and
experienced engineers which will also serve as  ‘finishing school’ for young
engineers and as ‘refresher training centre’ for middle level management 
Formulation of an effective IPR policy for the national & organizations to
protect the innovations of & engineers and also to avoid possible infringements
&  ACTIVITIES IN POWER SECTOR 19 Central Electricity Authority National
Electricity Plan  Need for preparation of  well-defined Policy to provide
incentives for the commercialization of products developed through indigenous &
efforts and by Start-Up Organizations based in India This should be aimed at
easing the Market entry for newly / indigenously developed power products and
solutions Incentives could be excise duty exemption for  period of at least five
years from the date of commercialization and Qualifying requirement (QR)

training infrastructure in Thermal and Transmission areas However, there is need
for creation of infrastructure in Hydro and Distribution areas considering that
all existing employees are imparted -week training annually and new inductees
are imparted induction training of duration mentioned in the CEA Regulations
Actual deficit in Hydro and Distribution would be marginally less as almost all
NPTI institutes also conduct training in Hydro areas except HLTC, Bangalore and
in distribution areas while predominantly they conduct training in thermal areas
except in case of PSTI and HLTC at Bangalore and HPTC at Nangal, Punjab Further,
some infrastructure available with training cells, which also impart training,
at the power companies would also reduce the infrastructure deficit The existing
infrastructure itself is grossly under-utilised The under-utilisation is mainly
due to organisations under state government particularly Discoms giving almost
no attention to training Thus, efforts should be made to optimally utilise the
existing infrastructure All the organisation under state/pvt/ central sector are
required to impart training to their personnel at Government recognised
institutes as mandated in CEA’ Safety Regulations There is  need for creation of
infrastructure by way of setting up new institutes or augmenting the
infrastructure in the existing institutes  in CEA recognized institutes and
other training institutes However, priority be given on utilization of existing
input structure More infrastructure can be created in phased manner Same
approach may be adopted in case of simulator training infrastructure  Classroom

in Table Training of personnel engaged is Nuclear power is not controlled by the
Ministry of Power The concerned Ministry may take stock of the training
infrastructure in Nuclear power Similarly, the area of Solar and Wind power
comes under MNRE The training infrastructure available for training in solar and
wind power is not well organised and low in comparison to the requirement The
existing power sector institutes need to start training/ augment training
capacity for RE areas Training in solar and wind areas may be made statutory on
the line of training specified for those engaged in the & of Thermal, and Hydro
power plants, thereby the infrastructure creation will gain momentum and
training could be provided in more fruitful and productive manner  Simulator
Training Load Training infrastructure to meet mandatory simulator training has
very little shortage in thermal which would be bridged once  planned simulators
at different NPTIs are installed Requirement of hydro simulator would also be
met once these multi-mode simulators are installed at NPTI The simulator
training load requirement and existing availability are indicated in Table 17

for Classroom Training Infrastructure for Engineers, Supervisors and Operators
The maximum infrastructure requirement for class-room training for engineers,
supervisors and operators has been calculated as 1267 thousand-man-weeks per
year for 2017-The infrastructure available for class-room training for
engineers, supervisors and operators has been estimated as 435 thousand-man-
weeks per year for 2017-Therefore, there is  huge deficit of 794 thousand-man-
week infrastructure in & training of technical personnel for  in the field of
conventional power When training load for solar and wind is included the
infrastructure shortage adds to 817 thousand-man-weeks In terms of area specific
break up, there is no shortage of infrastructure in Transmission and Thermal
areas However, In the distribution sector the infrastructure requirement for
class-room training for engineers, supervisors and operators has been calculated
as 927 thousand-man-weeks per year for  while the infrastructure available for
class-room training for engineers, supervisors and operators for distribution
sector has been estimated as 23 thousand-man-weeks per year for 2017-In the
Hydro area also, there is only 34 thousand-man-weeks HUMAN RESOURCE REQUIREMENT
13 Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan infrastructure
available as against the requirement of 56 thousand-man-week Thus, there is
deficit of 22 thousand-man- weeks per year for  in Hydro area To bridge the
infrastructure gap corresponding to 816 thousand-man-weeks and cater to training
load in ,  huge fund would be required to be invested by the concerned
organisations The training infrastructure required for the  is to meet the
training load of 1335 thousand-man-weeks per year, which is little more than
that the requirement of 1267 thousand-man-weeks per year in  period  Funding for
Thermal Simulator Infrastructure As per the Gazette Notification No
CEI//59/CEA/EI (Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply) Regulations,
2010 of CEA, persons working in the & of Thermal Power Plants have to undergo
weeks simulator training The infrastructure available for simulator training has
been calculated based on the existing simulators available in the country, which
is  thousand-man-weeks per year The infrastructure requirement has been
calculated as 79 thousand-man-weeks per year for the 2022-Therefore, there is
deficit of 99 in Thermal simulator infrastructure Considering  batch size of 16
and total number of 22 batches in  year, one training simulator can provide 704
of thousand man weeks in  year Therefore, to create the simulator infrastructure
required for deficit training requirement of 99 thousand-man-weeks per year
during the 2022-However, no funding is required in this respect as NPTI is
already in the process of acquiring  multi-mode Simulators  Funding for Hydro

persons working in the & of hydel power plants have to undergo  week simulator
training The infrastructure available for simulator training has been calculated
based on the existing simulators available in the country, which is 45 thousand-
man-weeks per year The infrastructure requirement has been calculated as 32
thousand-man-weeks per year for the  and 88 thousand-man-weeks per year for the
2022-Therefore, there is  deficit of 87 thousand-man-weeks per year for the ,
which could be bridged with the setting up of simulators by  NPTIs at different
locations Thus, no more investment in hydro simulator would be required While
calculating the availability,  batch size of 10 and total number of 44 weeks has
been considered in  year, thus one training simulator providing 44 thousand-man-
weeks in  year  Funding for Training To create the infrastructure required to
meet the annual training load in ,  huge investment shall be required However,
it is proposed that instead of creating new infrastructure, all NPTI institutes
along with two upcoming institutes one each in Kerala and Madhya Pradesh may be
fully utilized to accommodate the above mentioned training load RECOMMENDATIONS
 All the organisations under central/ state/private sector are required to
impart training to their personnel at the institutes recognised by the
Government(CEA/MoP) as mandated in Regulation  &  of CEA (measures relating to
safety and electric supply) Regulations It is proposed that all Central Sector
Utilities, State Sector Utilities and IPPs provide & and refresher training as
per the norms stipulated in Regulation  &  of CEA (measures relating to safety
and electric supply) Regulations   NPTI has been entrusted with the role and
responsibility as  National Apex Body for training by the Government of India
(Gazette Notification July , 1993) and it runs the training programmes for the
power sector personnel as mandated in the Regulations  & & of CEA Regulations
NPTI’ expertise in the training may be utilised by all Utilities / Industries of
Power Sector to meet their mandatory requirement of Induction training to their
new entrants as well as refresher training to their existing personnel which
would, apart from meeting their training requirement, ensure effective
utilisation of the huge infrastructure available with the NPTI  Power sector
training in the areas of Smart Distribution, Smart Transmission and Smart
Generation may also be strengthened in coordination with NPTI in order to
accommodate emerging areas This will help prepare competent man power for
upcoming Renewable Installations of 175 GW in Solar, Wind, Small Hydro, etc In
compliance with the National Training Policy(NTP) of Ministry of Power, all
organizations need to allocate training budget at least equal to % percent of
the salary budget exclusively for funding training activities  HUMAN RESOURCE
REQUIREMENT 14 Central Electricity Authority National Electricity Plan CHAPTER
15 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The National Electricity Plan includes
review of the 12th Plan, detailed capacity addition requirement during the years
and Perspective Plan projections for the years 2022-After carrying out the
detailed exercise towards formulation of National Electricity Plan, following
conclusions and recommendations have emerged 12TH PLAN CAPACITY ADDITION ) In
the 12th Plan, capacity addition from conventional sources is 99,MW (Coal 83,560
MW, Lignite ,290 MW, Gas ,MW, Hydro ,479 MW, Nuclear ,000 MW) against  target of
88,537 MW This is about 112% of the target Private players have started playing
dominant role in capacity addition in power sector with 56 % of total capacity
addition during 12th plan coming from private sector There has been considerable
slippage in achievement of capacity addition target of Hydro and Nuclear sources
(Slippage: Hydro ,451MW and Nuclear ,300 MW) in the 12th Plan period The factors
affecting capacity addition in Hydro and Nuclear sectors need to be addressed
urgently to arrest the further decline in generation mix ii) iii) iv) During
12th plan, capacity addition from supercritical technology based coal power
plants has contributed around 42% of the total capacity addition from coal based
plants &/LE works in respect of 37 Nos thermal units with aggregate capacity of
,MW have been completed during 12th Plan Also about MW of Hydro capacity has
been achieved through uprating, life extension and restoration activities for
total of 20 hydro & schemes as on 31st March,) vi)  capacity addition of 32,741
MW from Renewable Energy Sources has been achieved during 12th Plan DEMAND SIDE
MANAGEMENT ) There would be reduction in electrical energy requirement through
implementation of various programs of Demand Side Management, energy efficiency
and conservation measures like & (Standards & Labelling), PAT (Perform-Achieve-
Trade) Scheme in industries, LED domestic & Street lighting etc ii) Total energy
savings during the year  and  has been estimated to be 249 BU and 337 BU
respectively This will result in reduction in both Electrical Energy Requirement
(BU) and Peak Demand (MW) iii)  uniform approach for formulation of DSM
regulations (including demand response) throughout the country may be taken up
in the Forum of Regulators Regulators need to notify appropriate DSM regulations
and direct the DISCOMs to prepare time bound DSM action plan Regulators may
direct Distribution Companies to take up energy efficiency measures in their
areas The DISCOMs may be suitably incentivized to implement DSM projects like
lighting, air-conditioning, agricultural pumps, refrigerators and ceiling fans
etc for reduction in their peak demand DEMAND PROJECTIONS ) Electricity demand
of the country is periodically assessed by the Electric Power Survey Committee,
taking into account the actual electricity demand incident on the system in the
past years, planned and under implementation policies and programmes of the
Government, various developmental activities projected in future, impact of
energy conservation measures etc ii) The electrical energy requirement and peak
electricity demand on all-India basis has been taken as per the 19th EPS to work
out the generation capacity addition requirement The EPS exercise involves all
stakeholders and an extensive exercise has been done Distribution company wise
electricity demand projection has been carried out to arrive at the State /
region and all- India electricity demand projection Electrical energy
requirement and peak demand on all-India basis adopted for generation expansion
planning exercise is as under: Year   Energy Requirement ( BU) Peak Demand (GW)
1566 2047 226 299 iii) CAGR of electrical energy requirement from  to  works out
to 18 % and the CAGR of CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Central Electricity
Authority National Electricity Plan electrical energy requirement from  to
works out to 51 % The CAGR of electrical energy requirement in the country from
the year  to  has been 28 % Load forecasting is undertaken by CEA once in five
years through EPS committee While making the load forecasting,  number of
assumptions are made In actual, these assumptions may deviate and need suitable
modifications It is therefore, suggested that  Mid-term review of EPS Load
Forecasting should be undertaken to help the stakeholders in the electricity
sector to facilitate effective investment decisions iv) CAPACITY ADDITION
REQUIREMENT ) During the years  () Priority has been accorded towards
development of hydro, nuclear and gas based projects which are already committed
for the year 2017-Committed Hydro capacity addition of ,823 MW has been
considered during  based on assessment of progress of actual status of the
projects Nuclear capacity of ,300 MW during  has been considered for planning
studies as per the information furnished by DOAE Gas based capacity of 406 MW
has been considered based on the projects that are in various stages of
construction Considering the demand projections for the year  as per the 19th
EPS, committed capacity addition from Gas 406 MW, Hydro ,823 MW, Nuclear ,300
MW, RES ,17,756 MW and likely retirement of 22,716 MW of coal based capacity
during , the study result reveals that coal based capacity addition of ,445 MW
is required during the period 2017-However,  total capacity of 47,855 MW coal
based power projects are currently under different stages of construction and
are likely to yield benefits during the period 2017-Thereby, the total capacity
addition during  is likely to be ,76,140 MW (ii) (iii) An alternate scenario has
also been constructed considering demand CAGR of 18% during the years 2017- It
was found that 19,700 MW coal based capacity addition is required during the
years  in case of increased demand scenario However, coal based capacity of
47,855 MW are at different stages of construction and are likely to yield
benefits during 2017-In view of  large capacity addition programme from
Renewable Energy Sources, Hydro and Gas based power stations are required to
play vital role by providing balancing power to cater to the variability and
uncertainty associated with Renewable Energy Sources Therefore, suitable
measures to ensure timely completion of capacity addition from hydro and
adequate supply of natural gas to stranded gas based power plants may be taken
(iv) () As per Electricity Act, 2003, CEA has to prepare National Electricity
Plan for Generation and Transmission The basic objective of Generation Planning
is to find out the ideal generation mix based on the demand projections In view
of this, an integrated approach for planning generation capacity addition
involving various concerned ministries like MOP, MNRE, Department of Atomic
Energy (DOAE) etc needs to be adopted (vi) The rate of capacity addition
particularly from coal based stations has outpaced the rate of increase in
demand during the period from 2017-The PLF of the coal based stations is likely
to come down to around % by  with likely demand under CAGR of 18% and 175 GW of
capacity addition from RES In the event of increase in demand, without any
deviation in other variables like RES or coal based retirements, the PLF of the
coal based stations will invariably increase ) During the years  () Priority has
been accorded towards development of hydro and nuclear based projects which are
already likely to get commissioned in the year 2022-Hydro capacity addition of
12,000 MW based on the projects concurred by CEA has been considered during
2022-Nuclear capacity of ,800 MW during  has been considered for planning
studies as per the information furnished by DOAE No new gas based power plants
has been considered during  in view of acute natural gas shortage in the country
Import from neighbouring countries to the tune 21,600 MW has been considered for
the studies (ii) Considering the demand projections for the year  as per the
19th EPS, coal based capacity addition of 47,855 MW already under construction
for benefits during , committed capacity addition of Nuclear ,800 MW, Hydro
12,000 MW, RES ,00,000 MW and likely retirement of 25,572 MW of coal based
capacity during , study results reveals that capacity addition of 46,420 MW is
required during the period 2022- This capacity addition required during  as
shown in the results is in fact the peaking capacity requirement to be met in
the grid This capacity requirement can be met from any conventional source of
energy but preferably from peaking power plants like hydro, gas or energy
storage devices CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Central Electricity Authority
National Electricity Plan (iii) During the period from , the PLF of the thermal
plants shall progressively increase and would be hovering around 61% by
2026-(iv) It is expected that the share of non-fossil based installed capacity
(Nuclear + Hydro + Renewable Sources) will be increased to % by the end of  and
will further increase to % by the end of  considering capacity addition of
47,855 MW coal based capacity already under construction and likely to yield
benefits during  and 46,420 MW coal based capacity addition required during
2022-THERMAL ) ii) India is now making  transition from power deficit to power
surplus scenario Avenues of exports of surplus power available in the Indian
Grid to the SAARC countries need to be vigorously explored and pursued iii)
significant percentage of generating plants in the country is well past their
useful life They also contribute significantly to environmental pollution
CEA/MoP may undertake periodically  study to identify these units and draw up
time bound action plan for retirement of these inefficient and old units in
consultation with the State Governments/ stakeholders Retrofitting of the
existing thermal plants for increased ramping capacity and backing down capacity
must be explored in view of integration of RES Thermal plant in the vicinity of
city may explore the possibility of using treated sewage water from
municipalities/corporations Proper assessment of requirement of water by the
power plants and availability of treated water from sewage need to be made for
this purpose India is now having manufacturing capability of power plants
related equipment to the extent of 20,000 MW per year With the infusion of high
quantum of RES into the grid, this full capacity may not be utilized by meeting
the internal demand of the country To ensure full utilization of capacity, the
manufacturing companies may explore the possibility of exporting the equipment
to other countries This shall be consistent with the “Make in India” policy of
the Government of India iv) ) vi) vii) To accommodate high quantum of RES into
the grid, thermal plants are likely to run at low PLF in future Many plants may
get partial/nil schedule of generation Market mechanisms like ancillary services
needs to be evolved through regulatory intervention so that the owners of
thermal plants are able to use some of the stranded capacity viii) The
electricity grid is undergoing rapid transformation in terms of net load
characteristics after accommodating the variability of RES Conventional power
plants must have rapid ramping and backing down capability It is proposed that
the ramping and backing down characteristics of different categories of
conventional generating units are spelt out in the CEA standard  conventional
unit should demonstrate its ramping and backing down capability before it is
declared under commercial operation ix) To harness the balancing potential of
the existing power plants, it is essential to develop market mechanism through
regulatory intervention The market must provide proper price signal to the
potential stakeholders in the grid to willingly participate in the balancing
market ) Gas based power stations are best suited after hydro power plants
(including PSPs) for providing balancing requirements of the grid due to
integration of RES Therefore, adequate gas should be made available for
effective utilization of existing gas based stations FUEL REQUIREMENTS ) For the
year , coal based generation programme of 958 BU has been estimated in
consultation of the power utilities The total coal requirement of 630 MT for the
power plants has been estimated considering normal monsoon year during the year
2017-The total coal requirement in the year  and  has been estimated as 735 MT
(Base case) and 877 MT respectively including imported coal of 50 MT The coal
requirement for the year  and  has been worked out considering 30% reduction in
Hydro generation due to failure of monsoon and being supplemented by coal based
generation Against  total domestic gas allocated to power projects of 05 MMSCMD,
total gas supplied to these gas based power plants during the year  was only 59
MMSCMD It has been estimated that the gas based power stations shall need at
least 27 MMSCMD of gas to meet the balancing and peaking requirement of the grid
The scheme for utilisation of stranded gas based generation capacity introduced
by Government of India is for two years only However,  long term policy
intervention is required for optimal utilization of gas based capacity in the
country ii) iii) iv) ) CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Central Electricity
Authority National Electricity Plan vi) The regasification capacity in the
country is also  matter of concern for gas based power plants, particularly for
those who are connected with RGTIL East-West pipeline Due to technical
constraints like directional flows etc, imported RLNG from west coast cannot be
transported to power plants located in the East CoastTherefore, facility of re-
gasification capacity may be suitably created at East coast also HYDRO ) Even
though India is endowed with vast potential of hydro power, the development of
hydro power has not taken place as per the planned capacity addition In fact,
the % of hydro capacity in the overall Installed capacity of the country has
been registering  steady decline The hydro development is plagued with many
problems like land acquisition, & issues, environmental and forest clearance etc
Now, the need for capacity addition in hydro power is felt all the more with the
rapid capacity addition in RES Pumped storage and run of the river (with
pondage) type of hydro power plants are ideal to meet the ramping and balancing
requirement of the grid In view of this, appropriate measures must be taken to
address the problems associated with the hydro power development in the country
ii) At present India is having  no of PSPs with  total installed capacity of
,786 MW However, of these only  no of PSP having IC of ,600 MW are operational
Others hydro power plants are not working in pumping mode due to  variety of
reasons The swing available from generation mode to pumping mode and vice versa
in  pumped storage plant is an effective tool in the hands of the grid operators
for grid management Installation of more number of PSPs and ensuring that the
existing PSPs are capable of running as PSPs, is the need of the hour Suitable
policy may be framed for encouraging and exploiting pump storage potential of
the country It is proposed that, for the sake of grid stabilization, effective
control of operation of these plants by RLDCs/SLDCs needs to be evolved in
consultation with States/Developers/Regulators iii) Most hydro power plants have
the ability to provide balancing power to manage variability associated with
variable Renewable Energy (Solar and Wind) However, their participation in the
above has been lukewarm as no financial incentive exists today on this account
There is no distinction between peak and off-peak tariff of  hydro plant
Therefore, suitable price signal needs to be generated to induce voluntary
participation of the hydro plants in balancing requirement of the grid Further,
it is also proposed that infrastructure cost from the hydro project may be
excluded for the purpose of determination of tariff RENEWABLE ENERGY ) India has
achieved  total installed capacity of 57,24 MW from Renewable Energy Sources as
on ii) The country has revised its Renewable Energy capacity target to 175 GW by
2022 in view of the significant renewable energy potential in the country iii)
Accelerated development of RES requires adequate indigenous manufacturing
facility for RES related equipment Policy framework may be developed to
encourage setting up of RES related equipment manufacturing facility in the
country This would be consistent with the Government of India’ “Make in India”
policy KEY INPUTS ) Adequate manufacturing facilities exist in India for main
plant equipment However, lack of orders is  concern of all equipment
manufacturers ii)  joint mechanism may be created under Ministry of Steel with
participation from power equipment manufacturers and steel manufacturers for
more information sharing on compositions/properties of various steels and steel
products required and their indigenous development by the steel industry iii) An
organizational mechanism for information sharing on BoP vendors across
industries needs to be considered Such  mechanism could provide the details on
orders in hand, & available, past performance etc This could be  web based
portal under DHI or Ministry of Commerce iv) New advanced technologies based BoP
systems like High Concentration Slurry Disposal (HCSD) type ash disposal
systems, closed pipe type conveyors for coal handling plants (CHP), large size
Reverse Osmosis systems also need to be indigenized ) ODC movement continues to
be  major constraint Thus, the suggestion of manufacturers towards adoption of
standardized maximum axle weight of around 16 MT/axle with no approvals required
thereafter, single window clearance system for ODCs or undertaking  National
Bridge Up-gradation Programme for upgradation of all bridges to minimum strength
facilitating ODC movements need to be considered to remove the constraints
prevailing in ODC movements CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Central Electricity
Authority National Electricity Plan vi) Inland waterways can become an
attractive mode of transportation in conjunction with Railways The success of
NTPC coal transportation to Farakka could be replicated across numerous other
stations vii) The prevailing regasification capacity for LNG in the country
stands at about 21 Million metric tons per annum (MMTPA) – further expansions
are being planned by several players Also additional 15,000 km, of gas pipelines
are under construction for completion of national Gas grid viii) Future
Infrastructure Project in railway line, Port development will be done through
PPP mode ix) Task Force may be created under NTPC with participation from
equipment manufacturers/EPC contractors and utilities to examine the issue of
pace of project execution in detail and work out an optimized framework of site
preparation, & requirements etc for overall improvement in project execution 10
FUND REQUIREMENTS ) The total fund requirement for capacity addition is
estimated to be ₹ 11,55,652 crores during the period , which includes the RES
capacity addition, as well as the expenditure done during this period for the
projects coming up in the year 2022-ii) The total fund requirement is estimated
to be ₹ ,56,214 crores for the period  and does not include advance action for
projects coming up during the period  ENVIRONMENT ) The total CO2 emissions
projected for the year  and  is 1026 Million Tonnes and 1173 Million Tonnes
respectively ii) The average emission factor from grid connected power stations
during  was 721 kg CO2/kWh It is expected to reduce to 604 kg CO2/kWh in the
year  and to 524 kg CO2/kWh by the end of 2026-iii) Emission intensity kgCO2/GDP
(₹) from grid connected power stations is likely to reduce by 51 % by the end of
and 65 % by the end of  from the year 2005 level iv) It is estimated that 69
Million Tonnes of CO2 emissions have been avoided by 2017 due to commissioning
of Super-critical technology based coal power plants vis--vis the scenario of
only subcritical units had been commissioned ) It is estimated that about 268
Million Tonnes of CO2 emission will be avoided annually by the end of the year
from renewable energy sources vi) Country has achieved 97% of fly ash
utilisation in the years 2015-In terms of absolute value, the same stands at 77
million tonnes vii)Detailed unit-wise feasibility study covering all factors
like technology, investment, time frame, suitability in Indian context etc may
be carried out 12  &  in POWER SECTOR There are many problems in Indian power
sector which are specific to Indian conditions Through promotion of &, these
specific problem areas need to be addressed It is suggested that CEA may act as
an interface between Industry and academics for this purpose An advisory group
may be created for promotion of & activities in the country with  permanent cell
at CEA The advisory group may have members drawn from Government, Dominant
players in the field of Generation, Transmission and Distribution sectors like
NTPC, NHPC, BHEL, Powergrid, CESC etc, Research institutions like CPRI and
Academic Institutions like IISc/IITs/ NITs 13 HUMAN RESOURCE ) Sufficient number
of Engineers, Managers and Diploma holders are available in the country However,
there are gaps in respect of lower level skills like that of ITI ii) It is
proposed that all Central Sector Utilities, all State Sector Utilities and all
IPPs should create sufficient Training infrastructure as per the norms
stipulated in notification of September 2010 issued by CEA iii) CEA has
recognized about 74 Training Institutes spread all across the country These
institutes may be strengthened for Distribution/Lineman training along with
training in renewable sector such as solar, wind etc iv) As per National
Training Policy of MoP all organizations need to allocate training budget at
least equal to % of salary budget exclusively for funding training activities
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
