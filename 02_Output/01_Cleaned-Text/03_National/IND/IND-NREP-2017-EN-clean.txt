Rapidly rising energy demand and reliance on fossil fuels India’ energy needs
are rising fast, with growth in electricity demand and other energy uses among
the highest in the world In one direction lies  future heavily reliant on fossil
fuels; and in the other,  more diverse energy mix based on greater use of
renewables� If India follows the first route, it risks locking its energy system
into today’ pattern – with increasing levels of air pollution, uncertainties
around meeting its sustainability targets and concerns about supply and sourcing
for coal, oil and natural gas� The government, contemplating  better path, has
taken steps to increase renewables and move the country towards  sustainable
future� Still, much remains to be done� This report provides  perspective on the
changes required for India to achieve an affordable, secure, inclusive and
environmentally friendly energy system� India’ socio-economic characteristics
make it unique among the world’ major energy-consuming economies Per capita
income is low, but is expected to grow quickly as India becomes the world’ most
populous country towards the end of this decade� Population and economic growth,
combined with accelerating urbanisation, will increase the number of people
living in cities and towns from approximately 435 million in 2015 to 600 million
by 2030� Urban populations consume more energy and – importantly in India’ case
– significantly more electricity� India’ total demand for energy will more than
double by 2030, while electricity demand will almost triple Ensuring that India’
growing population has access to energy, and meeting the country’ ambitious
economic growth targets, will require massive investments in the power,
transport, buildings and industry Figure : Growth in key economic and energy

IRENA analysis  Wind Power Generation Company Astrakhan Region WF
"Narimanovskaya" 24 MW sectors� Despite rapidly growing demand and significant
renewable energy potential, India is set to install less renewable power-
generation capacity than China, Germany or the United States� India’ electricity
demand has grown by 10%  year over the past decade� Rapid growth is expected to
continue, requiring massive investments in power-generation capacity and related
infrastructure� This creates an important opportunity for renewable energy
deployment, assuming the right policies are in place and policy makers start
planning for it now� Despite rapid strides in adding power capacity, India
continues to be plagued by widespread energy poverty Much of the population
lacks access to clean and affordable energy� Estimates suggest that 80 million
households, or more than 300 million people, have limited or no access to
electricity� While the electricity grid now covers much of the country, reaching
rural or remote areas with the necessary transmission and distribution
infrastructure often remains  challenge� Supply constraints, therefore, persist�
In economic terms, the health impact of outdoor air pollution costs about % of
India’ annual gross domestic product, and indoor air pollution adds
significantly to this total The World Health Organization estimates that the
number of deaths from ambient air pollution reached 700 000 in 2010� Besides,
400 million Indians (90% of them women) are exposed to respiratory, pulmonary
and vision hazards associated with indoor air pollution from burning traditional
biofuels� Both outdoor and indoor air pollution must be addressed through clean
and sustainable rural and urban energy supplies� If business continues as usual
and present energy and environmental policies persist, fossil fuels will still
dominate India’ total energy mix in 2030 and beyond Such  pathway, known as the
Reference Case in this report, relies heavily on fossil fuels along with
unsustainable and inefficient uses of bioenergy to meet most of the country’
rising energy demand� While the growth of renewable power generation will
accelerate, even faster increases are expected in the use of coal for industry,
natural gas in residential and commercial buildings, and oil in transport�
India’ demand for coal is set to triple by 2030� As  result, the share of modern
renewables could decrease from around 17% to only 12% of India’ total energy mix
by 2030�  large share of energy demand will need to be supplied by imports,
increasing energy security risks� Growing reliance on coal imports will add to
India’ existing import dependency for oil and gas� Figure : Power system
capacity and generation,   450 TWh  100 TWh 670 GW 284 GW Power system capacity
Gross power generation 2015 2030 Source: IRENA analysis  India’ total gross
power capacity will more than double from 284 gigawatts (GW) in 2015 to an
estimated 670 GW by 2030, while electricity generation more than triples from
100 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year to over  450 TWh per year More than three-
quarters of this new production is to be met by new coal-based capacity,
according to current plans and policies (the Reference Case in this study)� The
planned growth in renewable power capacity, while significant, is low by
comparison� India has set  target of 175 GW of renewable energy in power
generation by 2022, but developments after that date are uncertain� Policy
makers have thus far overlooked the potential of renewable energy in heating,
cooling and transport Apart from the rising electricity demand, India has
started to witness very rapid energy demand growth for heating, cooling and
transport� National plans currently envisage the vast majority of this being met
with fossil fuels� The significant renewable potential in these end-use sectors
could also be harnessed to address India’ energy supply challenges� An
affordable, secure and sustainable energy mix With one of the world’ largest and
most ambitious renewable energy programmes, India can take  leading role in
renewable energy transformation both regionally and globally The International
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has developed  roadmap to 2030 (REmap) to
explore different energy technology options, highlighting ways to increase the
uptake of renewable energy beyond the country’ present policies and plans� This
report has benefited from consultation and input over the course of two Figure :

black bars show the weighted average for the  period Levelised cost of
electricity (LCOE)  years from India’ Ministry of New and Renewable Energy
(MNRE) and numerous other stakeholders� The country has already devoted
considerable attention to renewables in its energy policy, becoming the first in
the world to set up  ministry dedicated exclusively to new and renewable energy
sources as long ago as 1992� Wind and solar policy and targets have, however,
only achieved mixed success over the past two and  half decades� India has set
target to install 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, showing an
awareness of how the marketplace for renewable energy technologies is changing�
Renewable energy has emerged, with growing frequency, as the least-cost option
to meet India’ rising energy needs Wind, bioenergy, small hydropower and solar
photovoltaics (PV) have all become increasingly competitive with fossil-fuel-
based power generation:  2016 tender for solar PV in India, for example,
produced bids of around United States dollar (USD) �06-�07 per kilowatt-hour
(kWh) (Indian Rupee (INR) �78/kWh)� But increasingly competitive production
costs are not the only reason to promote renewable energy� Other motivations
include reducing exposure to fossil-fuel price volatility, improving  heavily
burdened grid infrastructure, further expanding access to modern energy
services, curbing air pollution and meeting the country’ sustainability targets�
India must help to drive  comprehensive solution to climate change Its Intended
Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), submitted in October 2015, confirmed
the country’ previous, voluntary goal to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission intensity by % by 2020 (compared with 2005 levels) and went further to
pledge  reduction target of % by 2030 and to increase the share of renewables in
installed capacity to up to 40% by the same year� This report confirms that
India can achieve these targets – and shows how far it can realistically go
beyond them� In addition, the REmap analysis also shows that the country has the
potential to contribute 10% of the global carbon dioxide (CO2) emission
mitigation potential from renewable energy by 2030 that is needed, when combined
with increased energy efficiency, to set the work on  pathway consistent with
the Paris Agreement� Figure : Renewable power capacity developments 250 ) 200

2010 Reference Case 2030 REmap 2030  Renewable power will maintain its strong
growth in the Indian market reaching 35% share of generation, and 60% share of
power generation capacity The REmap Options – outlined in this report represent
accelerated uptake of renewable energy beyond the country’ current plans to
2030� Accordingly, total wind power capacity would reach 185 GW by 2030, almost
eight times its level at the end of 2015� Solar PV capacity would increase even
more than wind,  total installed capacity of almost 200 GW by 2030, with
additional capacity in off-grid� Renewable power’ share of total power
generation capacity would increase to 60% in REmap, compared to 39% with
expected developments (the Reference Case)� Thus, India’ INDC pledge of reaching
renewable energy share of 40% by 2030 is possible – and much more can be
achieved� Similarly, the country can achieve  35% share for renewables in power
generation� Integrating large shares of variable power generation requires
planning, and developing  future grid Much of the additional renewable
electricity generation deployed in REmap would be variable (such as solar PV and
wind), and often split into relatively decentralised generation units� As
result, variable renewable electricity would account for around 20% of total
electricity generation, and 45% of installed power capacity in REmap by 2030,
placing an increased strain on India’ already stressed transmission and
distribution grid� Solutions are needed to reinforce, expand and increase the
grid and enhance the flexibility of power-system infrastructure, while
incorporating storage options, demand-response, flexibility measures and
reducing grid losses� Figure : Breakdown of renewable energy use by application

Source: IRENA analysis  India can raise its final renewable energy use to
approximately  exajoules (EJ) by 2030 – equivalent to 222 million tonnes of oil
or  quarter of the country’ total final energy demand Realising this potential,
however, calls for more than increasing renewable power generation� Electricity
would account for around only 40% of the country’ total final renewable energy
use by 2030, even with REmap Options put into effect� The remaining 60% of
renewables would be used in heating, cooling and transport� Bioenergy and solar
energy are essential parts of the resource mix to realise India’ renewable
energy potential Various forms of biofuel – for transport, as well as for
generating electricity and heat – could account for 62% of total final renewable
energy use in REmap in 2030� Solar (both photovoltaics and thermal), at 16%,
would represent the second largest source of renewable energy use, followed by
wind at 14%, and hydropower at %� India could have 23 million electric four-
wheeled vehicles and 300 million electric two-and-three- wheelers on the road by
While biofuels are also becoming prominent, the use of electricity in transport
needs to increase as part of the country’ transition to renewables� Structural
changes – including highly improved, increasingly sustainable options for both
urban and longer-distance travel – could shift % of the country’ passenger
activity from individual vehicles to electrified mass transit� India could
become the fourth largest renewable energy market worldwide by It could account
for % of all global final renewable energy use, after China, the United States
and the European Union, assuming all countries achieve the potential highlighted
in REmap studies� REmap – IRENA’ global roadmap – indicates the technology and
policy choices needed to significantly increase the share of renewables in the
global energy mix by 2030� Benefits of more renewable energy The higher
renewable energy uptake taking place in REmap would result in savings twelve
times higher than costs This is the result of reduced costs from fossil fuel
externalities related to air pollution Figure : Annual costs and savings in

savings due to renewable energy� Savings from reduced air pollution alone would
total between USD 45 billion and USD 160 billion per year� Cutting energy-
related CO2 emissions by 750 megatonnes  year by 2030 would save another USD 13
billion–USD 63 billion per year� Other benefits of renewables – related to
energy access, energy security and other macroeconomic factors (�� impact on the
trade balance or gross domestic product (GDP)) – would add more to India’
savings� Accelerated energy efficiency improvements can ease India’ supply
constraints as well as yield  higher renewable energy share Along with
restraining overall demand, improved energy efficiency will help to meet India’
ambitious GHG emission-reduction goals� Studies indicate that India could have
over  million jobs in solar energy and over 180 000 in wind energy by The
prospect of rapid job creation,  major driver of policy in India, is among the
strong macroeconomic benefits of the transition to renewables� To achieve this
employment potential, the country must first meet an urgent, and currently
unsatisfied, need for training and skills development in the renewable energy
sector� India has limited sources of fossil fuels and is not geographically
adjacent to any major sources of oil or natural gas supply, making it vulnerable
to geopolitical and geo-economic shocks Local coal resources are of poor quality
(with high ash content), prompting the country to turn increasingly to imports�
This will add to concerns about the security of energy supply� Renewable energy
offers the dual advantage of improving energy access for poor communities and
bolstering energy security through diversified, and  largely indigenous, sources
of supply� The renewable energy technologies identified in REmap would lower the
demand for coal and oil products between 17% and 23% by 2030� Investment in
renewables can help drive India’ future economic growth The energy transition
envisaged in this report would involve average annual investments of USD 42
billion in renewable energy technologies between now and 2030� These include the
USD 16 billion annually taking place in the Reference Case, and the USD 26
billion for additional renewable energy options identified in REmap� Challenges
for renewable energy deployment Investment in renewable energy capacity needs to
gain impetus to meet near-term targets, as well as achieve India’ longer term
potential The investment challenge must address the higher upfront costs of
renewables and the uncertainty of long-term revenue generation� Currency hedging
can impede project development: investing in local currency adds - percentage
points to the weighted average cost of capital, compared to investments made in
US dollars� While the transition to renewables calls for  more decentralised
energy market, this entails its own set of challenges One of these is public
perception, which continues to favour centralised grid-based electricity: this
is compounded by the absence of strong regulatory frameworks for distributed
renewable energy� The big challenge for distributed renewables is to develop
business and financing models that trigger rapid deployment and growth in
ownership, particularly at the residential scale� At present, the decentralised
market is characterised by numerous different subsidies and standards, which are
often not monitored or implemented effectively� Reliable, affordable, secure
electricity production is essential to ensure continued industrial and
commercial growth and satisfy rising residential demand India’ grid
infrastructure is already strained and needs major improvements� Transmission
and distribution losses are among the highest in the world: one-quarter of total
electricity generation, rising as high as two-thirds in some states� As the
share of variable renewables (solar and wind) increases, the pressure will
continue to mount on India’ already stressed transmission and distribution grid�
Integrating this growing variability will require greater flexibility in power-
system infrastructure and storage� India needs to develop  skilled and
knowledgeable workforce to realise significant growth in renewable energy The
lack of employees trained in the skills needed to construct and operate
decentralised renewable energy systems is  continuing challenge and  barrier to
meeting renewable energy targets� Modern bioenergy can be  key source of heat
and power, particularly for rural populations There is  pressing need to
increase access to modern energy sources for hundreds of millions of India’
people� Households consume nearly 39% of total energy in India, with around
three-quarters of this consisting of traditional uses of bioenergy, which is
unhealthy and unsustainable� In contrast to such traditional sources, modern
bioenergy offers important socio-economic and human health benefits,
particularly through efficient cookstoves� Transport accounts for more than half
of India’ total petroleum consumption, and electrification offers  way to reduce
this demand The country requires massive infrastructure investments to realise
the potential of electric mobility and electrified mass-transit� It must also
make the resulting electricity use secure and sustainable� The interlinkage
between water, energy and food supply is  major consideration in India Demand
for all three is rising fast as the population and economy grow� 79% of India’
new energy capacity is expected to be built in areas that already face water
scarcity or water stress�  Areas for Action India is  country with  tremendously
dynamic and vibrant renewable energy market� The country is seeing activity
taking place on many fronts, with lots of on the ground innovation and
technology development occurring, and policy measures being taken on many
levels� However, there are key areas where additional solutions are needed for
India to realise significantly higher renewable energy uptake� The full report
discusses these solutions and associated challenges in greater depth� It
outlines five main areas of action: Establishing transition pathways for
renewable energy  Policy support for renewables needs to be durable and
credible� It should be supplemented by intermediate targets that are monitored
and, when necessary, revised� Specific advances would include: ● Improving the
enforcement of renewable energy purchase obligations (RPOs); ● Creating
conducive land acquisition policies; and ● Establishing priority-sector lending
for renewables; ● Increasing outreach to banks and establish  Green Bank; and ●
Promoting energy efficiency and renewable-based energy access� Creating an
enabling business environment  Improvements in the business environment and the
development of new business models would help to scale up renewable energy
technologies in India� Unstable policies, administrative delays, bureaucratic
malpractice and the absence of clear information all hinder the growth of
renewables in the country’ energy mix� Solutions include: ● Developing policy
frameworks that provide  level playing field for renewable energy and facilitate
the formation of markets; ● Ensuring transparent bidding processes, with
rigorous selection criteria and broad stakeholder participation; ● Reduce or
mitigate red tape� Existing policies are often shackled by slow-moving
bureaucratic procedures that discourage interest from investors and project
developers; ● Mobilise investments and reduce the costs of financing and
currency risks by establishing risk mitigation instruments and other funds and
facilities dedicated to renewables; and ● Reflect the true costs of fossil fuels
in energy pricing by including externalities relating to air pollution and
carbon emissions� Integrating renewable energy  The Indian transmission and
distribution grid is strained� Increasing its robustness and capacity is
paramount for the transition to  sustainable energy future� Along with
integrating renewable power, India needs  holistic approach to energy
development that recognises the linkages between electricity, heating and
transport needs� These linkages include both an emphasis on utilising renewable
power in end-uses, but also better collection of biofuel wastes and their
utilisation� Some solutions include: ● Strengthen transmission grids, reducing
grid losses, and improving the resilience of the power system by investing in
more flexible, dispatchable capacity, demand-response, interconnectors and
storage, as well as utilising transport/power-sector synergies� ● Giving
incentives to renewable energy project developers, such as first access to the
power grid through priority dispatch schemes; ● Encouraging the use of
information and communication technologies for managing peak loads, especially
in cities, which can also help to integrate renewable power; ● Supporting
research into the synergies between electric mobility and renewable power, while
developing renewable solutions that are applicable to India’ often unique energy
environment; and ● Creating  national bioenergy mission focused on helping to
meet industrial energy demand, including increasing the collection of
agricultural, forest and waste residues�  Managing knowledge India needs better
data and increasingly specialised skills and knowledge to maximise its renewable
energy potential� Timely and robust data must be made available, and relevant
skills must be developed� Knowledge-management measures could include: ● Regular
data collection from developers on the status of projects, capacity added per
year, and the jobs created; ● Information platforms for lending institutions to
encourage partnerships between banks; ● Improved air pollution emission
standards raised to the level of those in Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) countries; and ● Programmes to increase the awareness of
modern energy technologies and their maintenance� Unleashing innovation
Renewable energy deployment around the world depends on  combination of
technological improvements, new applications of existing technologies, systemic
creation of new business or financing models, and new, more inclusive policy
mechanisms� India, with its endemic problem of access to energy, has seen much
innovation in low-cost renewable applications and is constantly evolving
distribution and financing models� Further ways to spur innovative solutions
include: ● Incorporating renewable energy standards into the building codes for
all new buildings in cities; and ● Promoting technological development in energy
storage, energy monitoring and mechanisms to maintain  system balance�
INTRODUCTION 12% in 2030 (excluding traditional uses of biomass1)� This
Reference Case is conservative on renewables and does not include all the
accelerated commitments, such as in India’ Intended Nationally Determined
Contribution (INDC)� REmap is the global renewable energy roadmap of the
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)� It shows how accelerating the
penetration of renewable energy in individual countries could contribute to
doubling its share of the global energy mix by 2030� India has significant
potential to go further if all the potential renewable energy options identified
in REmap are deployed in addition to those in the Reference Case� The deployment
required to fill the gap is called the ‘REmap Options:’ these include – but also
go beyond – meeting India’ commitments in the INDC� Given the size of the
country, renewable energy technologies – and their related potentials – vary
from region to region: which include geothermal, wind and various forms of solar
and biomass� Key factors in achieving such  doubling include increased use of
wind and solar technologies, greater electrification, and the use of biomass for
heating, cooking, power generation and biofuels� Based on analysing 40
countries, representing 80% of global energy demand, REmap suggests that
existing and future renewable energy expansion, as currently planned, will
result in  21% share of total renewables worldwide in 2030 (IRENA, 2016a)�
doubling would result in  36% share, so there is  15% gap (World Bank, 2015)�
Each country will play  role in the global doubling, but this does not mean that
every country would double its renewable energy share� This national potential
is of global importance� Figure  provides  breakdown of total renewable energy
use across the 40 countries that have developed REmap Options� Four countries
account for half of the total renewable energy that could be consumed by 2030,
and if the European Union (EU) is considered the share rises to two-thirds�
India would be the third largest country consuming renewable energy, accounting
for % of the global total� So engaging India – together with the other largest
users such as Brazil, China, the EU and the United States (US) – is essential if
the goal of doubling renewable energy’ global share is to be achieved� REmap is
the result of  collaborative process between IRENA, national REmap experts
within the individual countries and other stakeholders� The current report
focuses on the actual and potential role of renewable energy in India,  major
energy producer and consumer, which accounts for  growing share of carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions� India is one of the world’ largest energy consumers
with  total final energy consumption (TFEC) of 17� exajoules (EJ) in 2010, % of
the total global TFEC (International Energy Agency (IEA), 2014)� India’ TFEC is
growing on average by % per year and stood at more than 20 EJ in 2014� The
country is home to 16% of the world’ population, has very low per capita energy
consumption and is growing rapidly – so many see it as one of the world’ largest
sources of increased energy demand in the coming decades� Four countries
(Brazil, China, India and the US) could account for half of global use of
renewable energy by 2030 The objective of this report is to provide detailed
background data, and the results of the India REmap country analysis, and to
then make suggestions as to how these results could be translated into action�
India’ TFEC is projected to more than double between 2010 and 2030, according to
the baseline scenario of the Planning Commission of the Government of India
(GOI, 2014b)� Over the same period, – according to this study and estimates by
the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) – the share of modern
renewables in India’ TFEC would decrease from 17% in 2010 to  Estimates for
traditional uses of biomass vary widely depending on the source�   Figure :

Source: IRENA (2016a) This report starts with  brief description of the REmap
methodology (Chapter )� It continues by explaining the present energy situation
and recent trends of renewable energy use (Chapter )� Chapter  discusses the
current policy framework and drivers for renewables in India� Chapter  discusses
the potential of different renewable energy resources in India� Chapter

barriers for renewable energy use in India (Chapter ), while Chapter  provides
policy recommendations for accelerating renewable energy uptake�    METHODOLOGY
AND DATA SOURCES This section explains the REmap methodology and provides
information about the background data used for the analysis of India� Annexes -
provide the data and background assumptions in greater detail� for the selection
of what constitutes  Reference Case was made based on discussions with the
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), as many of the aims of India’ INDC
are consistent with an accelerated renewables case� REmap is an analytical
approach for assessing the gap between current national renewable energy plans,
additional renewable technology options potentially available in 2030, and the
Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) objective of doubling the share of global
renewable energy by 2030� Once the Reference Case was prepared, additional
technology options were identified, known in this report as the REmap Options�
The choice of an options approach instead of  scenario one is deliberate: REmap
is an exploratory study, not  target-setting exercise� As of March 2016, 40
countries representing 80% of global energy use, are included in Remap:
Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Cyprus, Denmark,
the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, India (the
present study), Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait,
Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Poland, the Republic of Korea, the Russian
Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sweden, Tonga, Turkey, Ukraine, the
United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the US and Uruguay� The sources of the
REmap Options for India originate from  range of research that includes: ● For
the power sector: Planning Commission (GOI, 2014b) and Global Change Assessment
Model (GCAM) estimates of the CEEW, and India’ INDC; ● For heating (in the
buildings and industry sectors): Solar Water Heaters in India (GOI, 2010) and
the IRENA renewable energy in industry roadmap (IRENA, 2014b) with its
accompanying data; The analysis starts with national-level data covering both
the power generation and end-use energy demand (in buildings, industry,
transport and agriculture)� Current national plans, using 2010 as the base year
of this analysis, form the starting point� The Reference Case represents
policies in place or under consideration, including any energy efficiency
improvements contained in these projections� It includes the TFEC of each end-
use sector and the total generation of power and district heat sectors, and
breakdown by energy carrier for the period 2010–2030� The Reference Case for
India was based on the estimates from the Planning Commission of the Government
of India (GOI, 2014b) and the CEEW� Where necessary, 2010 IEA energy balances
for India have been updated with information originating from other national
sources or other estimates� The Reference Case assessment was prepared before
the release of India’ INDC in late 2015� The choice of this approach ● For the
transport sector: Planning Commission (GOI, 2014b), Vision 2020 –  Blueprint for
Railway Electrification Programme (GOI, 2011), and National Electric Mobility
Mission Plan 2020 (GOI, 2012) were mainly used; and ● Additionally, expert
opinions from MNRE, IRENA and external authorities were incorporated into the
analysis� These were primarily the sources of some biomass, off-grid and
renewable power technology assessments� IRENA has developed  REmap tool that
allows users to input data into an energy balance for 2010, 2020 and 2030, and
then assess technology options that could be deployed by 2030 that are
consistent with an accelerated deployment of renewable energy�  detailed list of
these technologies and the related background data are provided online, in
addition to  To the extent data availability allows, information for more recent
years ( 2013, 2014) is provided where relevant�   what is contained in the
Annexes to this report� The tool includes the cost (capital, operation and
maintenance) and technical performance (reference capacity of installation,
capacity factor and conversion efficiency) of renewable and conventional (fossil
fuel, nuclear and traditional use of biomass) technologies for each sector that
is analysed: industry, buildings, transport, power and district heat� energy
taxes, subsidies and  national cost of capital of 12% for India) in order to
generate  national cost curve, showing the cost of the transition as calculated
by businesses and investors� Assessment of all additional costs related to
complementary infrastructure – such as transmission lines, reserve power needs,
energy storage or fuel stations – are excluded from this study� However, the
report discusses the implications of infrastructure needs on total system costs,
where relevant, based on  review of comparable literature� Each renewable energy
technology is characterised by its costs, and the cost of each REmap Option is
represented by its substitution cost – the difference between the annualised
cost of the REmap Option and that of  conventional technology used to produce
the same amount of energy, divided by the total renewable energy use in final
energy terms (in 2010 real US Dollar (USD) per gigajoule (GJ) of final renewable
energy)� This indicator provides  comparable metric for all renewable energy
technologies identified in each sector� Throughout this study, the share of
renewable energy estimated is related to TFEC� It includes all six forms of
renewables: biomass, geothermal, hydropower (small and large), ocean, solar and
wind� It can be estimated including, or excluding, traditional forms of biomass:
if they are excluded, the share would refer only to modern renewables� It can be
estimated for the total of all end-use sectors of India or for each of them
individually (with or without the contribution of renewable electricity)� The
share of renewable power generation is also calculated� Further details of the
REmap methodology can be found online in IRENA’ REmap webpage at:  and in the
REmap global reports (IRENA 2014a, 2016a)� Substitution costs are the key
indicators for assessing the economic viability of REmap Options� They depend on
the type of conventional technology substituted, on energy prices and on the
characteristics of the Option� The cost can be positive (incremental) or
negative (savings), as many renewable energy technologies are already cost-
effective compared with conventional technologies, or could be so by 2030 as
result of cost-reduction driven by technological learning and economies of
scale� This report also discusses the financial needs and avoided externalities
that relate to renewable energy� Several financial indicators are developed:
Incremental system costs: This is the sum of the differences between the total
capital (in USD/yr) and operating expenditures (in USD/yr) of all energy
technologies based on their deployment in REmap and the Reference Case in  given
year; Based on the substitution cost and the potential of each REmap Option,
country cost supply curves were developed from two perspectives – government and
business – for the year 2030� In the government perspective, costs exclude
energy taxes and subsidies, and  standard 10% discount rate was used, allowing
comparison across countries and aggregation of results on  regional, sector or
global level� Estimating  government perspective allows for  country cost-
benefit analysis and for comparison of the 40 REmap countries with each other;
it shows the cost of doubling the global renewable energy share as calculated by
governments� ● investment needs: This is the Incremental difference between the
annual investment needs of all REmap Options and the investment needs of the
substituted conventional technologies� Investment needs for renewable energy
capacity are estimated for each technology by multiplying its total deployment
(in gigawatts (GW)) to deliver the same energy service as conventional  The
share of renewable energy share is estimated by dividing total final renewable
energy use by the TFEC� Total final renewable energy use includes: () total
renewable fuel use in end-use sectors to generate heat (process heat,
space/water heating, cooking, etc�); (ii) renewable motor fuels in the transport
sector; and (iii) total power and district heat consumption generated from
renewable sources� For the business perspective, the process was repeated to
include national prices (including, for example,  Indian Rupee (INR) was
equivalent to �0219 US Dollars (USD) in 2010�   capacity and the investment
costs (in USD per kilowatt (kW)) for the period � This total is then annualised
by dividing the number of years covered by the analysis; per tonne of CO2 is
assumed (IPCC, 2007) and is applied only to emissions of CO2, and not for other
greenhouse gases� According to the IPCC (2007), the carbon price should reflect
the social cost of mitigating one tonne of CO2 equivalent in GHG emissions� ●
Subsidy needs (also labelled as ‘investment support’ in the report): Total
subsidy requirements for renewables are estimated as the difference in the
delivered energy service costs for the REmap Option (in USD/GJ final energy)
relative to its conventional counterpart multiplied by its deployment in  given
year (in petajoules (PJ) per year)� The external costs related to human health
are estimated separately, which excludes any effect related to GHG emissions�
Outdoor air pollution is evaluated from: outdoor emission of sulphur dioxide
(SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter of less than � micrometres
(PM2�) from fossil fuel-based power plant operation; and outdoor emissions of
NOx, and PM2� from road vehicles ● External effects related to CO2 emission
reductions and improvements in outdoor and indoor air pollution from the
decreased use of fossil fuels have also been estimated� As  first step, CO2
emissions from fossil fuel combustion are estimated for each sector and energy
carrier, multiplying the energy content of each type of fossil fuel by its
default emission factors (based on lower heating values) as provided by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) (Eggleston et al�, 2006)�
Emissions were estimated separately for the Reference Case and REmap: the
difference between them yields the total net CO2 emission reduction from fossil
fuel combustion due to increased renewable energy use�  carbon price range of
USD  To evaluate the external costs related to outdoor emissions of SO2, NOx and
PM2� from fossil power plant operation, the following parameters were used: the
emission factor (�� tonne per kWh for 2010 and 2030 taken from the International
Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) GAINS database ECRIPSE scenario
(IIASA, 2014)); and the unit external costs (�� Euro-per- tonne average for the
EU, adapted for India from the EU CAFE project (AEA Technology Environment,
2005))� Values for the potential differences in external effects between the EU
and India are accounted for based on the difference in gross domestic product
(GDP)� An extended version of the methodology of the REmap analysis can be found
online�      RECENT TRENDS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE PRESENT ENERGY SITUATION
Key points Nuclear power accounts for the remaining % (� GW)� The share of
renewables fluctuated between 13% and 19% between 2000 and 2015, meeting 17% of
electricity supply in 2015� India can take the lead in driving the energy
transformation both regionally and globally with one of the largest, and most
ambitious, renewable energy programmes anywhere in the world� It has set  target
of 175 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2022, including 100 GW of
solar, 60 GW of wind, 10 GW of biomass and  GW of small hydropower� ● ● As of
2012, 75% of India’ population had reliable access to electricity� Annual growth
in grid electrification has attained % per year, but renewables-based off-grid
systems are often the most economical solution� There are  significant number of
rice husk gasification mini-grids and solar systems, including solar-with-
storage mini-grids� Government agencies are producing increasingly strong
financial support schemes for renewables� international Support development
banks has reached over USD  billion per year� Most of the focus has so far been
on generating renewable power� Efforts on end-use are concentrated around
improving energy efficiency and enabling access to modern energy services� ●
from regional and ● India’ grid infrastructure is already strained and needs
major improvements� Its transmission and distribution losses are among the
highest in the world, averaging 26% of total electricity generation� When such
non-technical losses as energy theft are included, average losses are as high as
50% in some regions� India’ TFEC has been growing at around % per year over the
past decade� In 2010 – the base year for this analysis – it stood at 17� EJ per
year� Renewable energy’ share of that was 40% – split into 17% for modern
renewables and 23% for traditional uses of biomass for cooking in the
residential sector� The share of modern renewable energy included �% for
renewable power, �% for biomass industrial process heat and �% for modern
biomass for cooking� ● ● Bioenergy remains the main source of renewable energy
in the buildings and industry sector� Solar heating, cooling and cooking
technologies are also used� Total installed solar water heating capacity reached
�61 million m2 ( GW) in 2014 and solar water heaters meet �% of the building
sector’ total final energy demand� By March 2013, there were �75 million biogas
and manure plants in India, around one third of the estimated potential� But the
consistency and availability of data on the use of renewables for heating and
cooling is mixed Total power generation has been growing at an average annual
rate of % per year during the past decade – exceeding  000 TWh in 2014, double
the 2000 level of 500 TWh� ● ● India submitted its INDCs to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in October 2015, pledging to
reduce the emission intensity of its economy, by 2030, by between 33% and 35%
from the 2005 level� It has also committed to increasing its share of By March
2016, India’ installed power generation capacity had reached 302 GW: 69% of it
is thermal� Most of the remainder is large hydropower (42� GW) and other
renewables (37� GW)� ●   renewable energy capacity to 40% by 2030� The Reference
Case shows this share growing to 37%: the REmap Option increased it to 60%�
About two-thirds of this would be installed in desert regions in northern and
western parts of the country� The plan is to use -15% of the wasteland available
in these regions to realise their large potential for solar and wind� Using 95%
of the available potential on 10% of the area would be equivalent to 271 GW of
total solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity and 29 GW of total wind� ● India
increasingly is importing fossil fuels� Its demand for coal is expected to reach
300 million tonnes per year (Mt/yr�) (35 EJ) by 2025 with 15% of it (200 Mt)
being met from other countries� The country’ crude oil production has reached �
EJ, and it imported an additional � EJ� Annual domestic production has been
stagnant at �83 million barrels per day over past years, and the import
dependency of crude oil and refinery throughput are 76% and 84�%, respectively�
The Twelth Five-Year Plan (FYP) expects imports to increase by 50% between 2012
and 2017� Total natural gas production was � EJ with � EJ being imported�
Consumption of natural gas is growing the fastest among fossil fuels, increasing
by 12% per year, between 2007 and 2012� The new Indian government is pushing for
investments in renewable power generation technologies amounting to USD 100
billion over the period to 2019� There is also strong financial support for
renewables in the country� In 2015 clean energy investment increased to USD 10�
billion, in line with expectations� This represented an increase from the
previous two years, but was still below the 2011 record of USD 13� billion� The
amount of support received from such institutions as the US Export Bank, KfW,
the Asia Development Bank (ADB) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) has
reached USD  billion in recent years� India is also to receive funds from the
World Bank to support one of its first ultra-mega solar projects, with  total
installed capacity of 750 megawatts (MW), in Madhya Pradesh� (Cleantechnica,
2014c)� The Government is now permitting full foreign direct investment and is
encouraging the transfer of foreign technologies, including renewables (GOI,
2014a): so far, co-operation frameworks have been established with 44 countries�
(MNRE, 2016a)� � Recent developments and long-term objectives India ranks sixth
in the world in total installed renewable power generation capacity after China,
the US, Germany, Spain and Italy� It recently set  target of 175 GW for 2022,
which implies that renewable energy would then contribute close to 20% of the
country’ total power consumption� The Government has raised the increase in
solar power capacity from 22 GW to 100 GW by 2022, while wind is to increase to
60 GW� There are also targets of 10 GW for biomass and  GW from small hydropower
for 2022 (Cleantechnica, 2015a)� No target for concentrated solar power (CSP)
exists�  target of  460 MW additional capacity has been set for 2015, just
quarter higher than the one set for 2014� The Government has allocated USD 400
million to facilitate deployment (Cleantechnica, 2015a)� It is collecting
considerable tax revenue from coal imports and production, which goes to the
National Clean Energy Fund to finance renewable energy projects� Coal taxes have
been doubled to USD � per tonne () of coal to increase revenue (Cleantechnica,
2015a)� But the industry views the fund availability as limited, when set
against the growing renewable energy targets (The Hindu, 2015)� This would
require 15 GW of annual solar installations in the next five years, slightly
higher than China achieved in 2015� India’ new government plans to use solar

access to power by 2019, as part of enhancing its plans to implement the
National Solar Mission (Cleantechnica, 2014b) using panels designed to light two
bulbs and to operate  cooker and  TV set in each home (Bloomberg, 2014a;
Cleantechnica, 2014b)� So far, most of the focus on renewable energy is in the
power sector, while efforts in end-use sectors are concentrated around improving
energy efficiency� The Government has set  fuel economy standard for new cars
and trucks: petrol mileage was projected to increase by 14% by the beginning of
2016, followed by  mandate to increase it by 38% between 2021 and 2022� The
current average efficiency of 37� miles per gallon According to Desert Power
India, the national target is to add 455 GW of renewable energy capacity by

by 2022, respectively� capacity is included, renewable power capacity in India
increases to around 42 GW� In , � GW of new grid-connected renewable power
capacity (excluding large hydropower) was installed� By the end of 2015, wind
energy accounted for the largest share of total capacity at 25� GW, followed by
solar power at � GW, biomass power at � GW and small hydropower at � GW (MNRE,
2016b)� India should take  leadership role in driving the energy transformation
both regionally and globally with one of the largest and most ambitious
renewable energy programmes in the world Wind power has accounted for the
majority of the capacity growth, with an average installation rate of  GW  year,
though this fell to �65 GW in 2015� The year 2011 was exceptional, with � GW
wind capacity installed� Annual solar PV capacity installation is increasing,
averaging 900 MW per year since 2011 (2015 saw an annual � GW increase)� Prior
to 2011, annual installed capacity was below 30 MW (MNRE, 2014b)� Indian
Railways now has 10 MW of solar capacity in small solar PV plants in about 500
stations and buildings, and is targeting  GW solar power capacity over the
coming years (Cleantechnica, 2014d)� India submitted its INDC to the UNFCCC
Secretariat in October 2015� In the past it had declared  voluntary goal of
reducing the emission intensity of its GDP by 20% to 25%, from the 2005 level,
by 2020, despite having no binding obligations for mitigation� The INDC pledged
that India will increase this target from 33% to 35% by 2030, again from the
2005 level (Cleantechnica, 2014a)� It also committed to increase its share in
renewable energy to 40% of installed capacity by 2030� The INDC includes
numerous specific goals, including increasing solar and wind energy to 100 GW
and 60 GW respectively by 2022, biomass to 10 GW by 2020, and nuclear power to
63 GW by 2032� Announcements for new solar PV projects indicate  significant
scale up of utility-scale ones, including single projects as big as  GW
(Cleantechnica, 2014d; 2014e; CEEW, 2015e)� The utility National Thermal Power
Corporation Limited has completed  successful  GW tender for solar, and
additional tenders were expected into 2016� One of the cheapest solar power
purchase agreements (PPA) in 2015 – at  rate of USD �077/kWh – was announced in
Madhya Pradesh (Hindustan Times, 2015a), and more recent bids early 2016 came in
at around USD �06-�07/kWh� � Recent developments in the renewable energy sector
Power sector Installed power capacity in India reached 284 GW in December 2015,
and 302 GW in March 2016� Of the total 69% is thermal capacity (coal, natural
gas and oil)� Large hydropower makes up 42� GW and other renewables 38� GW,
together they represent 27% of the total installed capacity (excluding off-grid
and captive renewable power capacity)� Nuclear power accounts for just under %
at around � GW of capacity (MNRE, 2016b; Central Electricity Authority (CEA),
2016)� The annual installation of biomass power averages 150 MW (excluding off-
grid and captive power plants)� Biomass in bagasse and non- bagasse cogeneration
plants as well as in gasifiers, biomethanation and power-alone plants� There
were more than 300 biomass cogeneration plants (500, including non-cogeneration)
with  total installed capacity of � GW at the end of 2015� The majority of this
capacity (close to  GW) is located in sugar mills producing power from bagasse�
Other grid- connected biomass power and gasification plants follow with  total
installed capacity of around � GW (MNRE, 2016b)� Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar
Pradesh and Uttarakhand – which are also the largest sugar cane producing states
in India – account for  large share of is used In the past five years, renewable

biomass-based grid- connected and off-grid power capacity targets have been
missed� The key issues were the availability, collection, processing, and
pricing of such agro-residues as rice husk, cotton stalk, coconut shells, soya
husk, coffee waste, and sawdust� (AIREC/SSEF, 2014)� The total installed off-
grid and captive renewable power generation capacity reached  237 MW by the end
of 2015 (excluded from Figure )� Half of it (603 MW) was biomass (non-bagasse)
cogeneration� The total installed capacity of biomass gasifiers stood at 179 MW,
nearly all of it (161 MW) in industrial plants with little (18 MW) in rural
areas� The capacity of solar home systems is growing fast: 55 MW capacity was
installed in 2015� Waste-to-energy (147 MW) is the other important capacity
installed (MNRE, 2015a)� Biomass power generation receives about USD 100 million
of investment each year in India: the various incentives to promote it include
accelerated Box : Bagasse-based CHP policy The Indian Government is pursuing its
bagasse-based cogeneration potential through financial and fiscal incentives�
Plants benefit from  capital subsidy ranging from USD 24 000 to USD 28 800 for
privately owned sugar mills� The subsidy is also available to existing co-
operative or public sugar mills – up to  maximum of USD � million per project –
and includes support for surplus power exported to the grid� Fiscal incentives
are also provided, including 80% accelerated depreciation and concessional
import and excise duties� Tapping the total industrial co-generation potential
in India would require wider policy programmes that also included non-bagasse
co-generation applications� Such measures as  more comprehensive co-generation
feed-in tariff (FiT) system, that included biomass and other co-generation
applications and open access without cross-subsidy surcharge, could help achieve
greater deployment of co-generation (IEA, 2014)�   Figure 10: Total renewable

in the year 2000 of 500 TWh� The country now accounts for approximately % of
total global electricity generation� economical solution to their needs (Szabo
et al�, 2011; Breyer, 2012)� By 2012, India’ electrification rate had reached
75% and the urban electrification rate that year was 94%, with the rural areas
reaching 67%� Growth rates for grid electrification in India – as in Indonesia
and the Philippines – have reached % per year� (The simple arithmetic of
expanding centralised grids is misleading, however, especially in view of the
geographic realities of mountain ranges with limited access such as in northern
India�) Fuel and light-related expenditures account for -10% of total household
expenditures in India, significantly higher than in other developing countries
(Dalberg, 2013)� Renewable power generation has also more than doubled over the
same period, from about 80 TWh in 2000 to over 200 TWh in 2015 (see figure 10)�
It represented 17% of total generation in 2015 made up of: 10% hydropower, %
wind, % biomass, % solar PV and �% CSP (GlobalData, 2016)� Renewable power
generation’ share of the total fluctuated between 13% and 19% in the period �
Renewables for distributed generation are becoming common to minimise the impact
of blackouts and load-shedding� India frequently experiences blackouts ranging
from  few to eight hours per day, as  result of inadequate transmission and
distribution capacity, as well as energy theft� Some cities and states have load
shedding schedules, giving some populations access to electricity for only -
hours per day� Kerala, for example, has load-shedding scheduled between -10 ��
each day� So households are adopting Rural electrification Seventeen percent of
the world’ population – an estimated �16 billion people – now live without
access to electricity� An estimated 615 million of these people live in Asia,
almost half of them – 304 million – in India� Renewables-based off-grid systems
are often the most   renewables to secure their electricity supply during these
hours, and manufacturing industry is installing biomass supplies and other
renewable units to ensure continuous power to their businesses� About 860 000
solar home systems, and around 750 mini-grid systems, were installed in India by
March 2012� The latter include 135 biomass rice husk gasification systems and
599 solar PV mini-grids, each with between 10 and 400 customers and  total
capacity of � MW� Sales of solar lanterns in Asia amounted to as high as �
million systems per year in 2011, much of them in India� Biomass-based power
systems are promoted inter alia where  handful of companies are installing them�
One company, Husk Power Systems, started in 2007, operated around 80 rice husk-
based mini-grids in 2013: their capacity ranged from  kW and they provided
electricity to over 200 000 people across 300 villages and hamlets� Bringing
electrification to more than 90% of India’ rural population would require USD 90
billion -190 billion in total investment between 2010 and 2030, mainly in
transmission grids (Daioglou, �, et al�, 2012)� Mini-grid and off-grid systems
offer an important alternative for reducing these investments, and India is
already  leading country for off-grid systems� Off-grid systems play an
increasingly important role in rural electrification in India� Mini-grids are
seen as stepping stones towards centralised grid extension� The Jawaharlal Nehru
National Solar Mission (JNNSM) is the main policy initiative promoting solar
energy, including off-grid power development, but there are several other
programmes for other renewable energy technologies� Some 40% of the power
required by India’ 740 000 telecom base stations – averaging - kilowatt
electrical (kWe) each and requiring - GW of capacity in total – comes from the
grid, the rest from diesel generators� The government mandated that half of
rural sites be Box : Renewable energy manufacturing in India India’ National
Manufacturing Policy seeks to increase the contribution of manufacturing to 25%
of GDP with  focus on ‘greener and cleaner’ technologies� The policy recommends
that  green manufacturing committee apply objective criteria to identify such
technologies, consistent with the National Action Plan on Climate Change
(NAPCC)� Yet, the Indian wind and solar manufacturing industries have seen
significant fluctuations in the last decade� Once highly competitive, the solar
sector has recently been unable to compete in the global market both on price
and quality� This has led to  decline in exports and an increasing presence of
foreign manufactured products in domestic installations� Indian wind
manufacturers are still able to meet domestic expectations� Both industries have
had to rely largely on their overseas suppliers and collaborators� Indian
manufacturers suggest that the high cost of finance, lack of working capital and
an insufficient credit line also put them at  disadvantage� It has been noticed
that – while the Indian wind sector is the more competitive of the two as
result of maturity over time – its solar counterpart has been propped up by the
demand created by the MNRE’ proposed minimum Domestic Content Requirement for
all solar projects� Domestic module manufacturing capacity stood at
approximately � GW at the end of March 2014, but only � GW of solar PV plants
were installed in India that year,  significant portion of them using imported
crystalline silicon (-Si) and thin film modules� At the time domestic PV cell
production capacity, which amounted to approximately � GW, was close to overall
PV installations during 2014� However the cell manufacturers were exposed to
extremely low capacity utilisation, producing around 250 MW that year, because
module manufacturers could source imported PV cells on account of their lower
costs The Chinese and other growing markets were supported by increased local
deployment of renewables and policies that promoted research and development (&)
and expansion of domestic manufacturing� These policies included co-ordination
with state and local governments, providing low-cost finance, making
significant economies of scale and ensuring the availability of such supporting
infrastructure as cheap electricity and domestic sourcing of components� Indian
manufacturers, on the other hand, faced  number of challenges such as high
interest rates, imported machinery, high electricity costs, slow technology
upgrade, and high lead times� The domestic content requirement imposed to
promote solar manufacturing has been controversial and widely debated, and has
failed to be effective� One reason is that it favoured local manufacturing for
crystalline silicon-based cells and modules and not thin-film� Secondly, the
policy was focused on manufacturing rather than adding value� This meant that
the focus was merely on making cells and modules, inadvertently ignoring the
large value-creation opportunities further upstream and in the balance of the
projects’ systems� Thirdly, it ran the risk of attracting trade disputes from
countries that considered such  policy to be in violation of World Trade
Organization rules: the resulting global surge of trade disputes has created
further uncertainty in an already fragile market� And finally, the policy was
bypassed by other countries using their donor and export credit agencies to
finance installations that used thin-film technology� Besides creating
distortions, this created  false sense of financial comfort among developers
while failing to prepare the domestic financial sector to take on  greater
burden of financing solar projects in subsequent phases� The domestic content
requirement provisions were modified in the second phase of the National Solar
Mission� They became technology-neutral but applied to only 375 MW of the 750 MW
central government procurement of solar power in the first round of bidding�
Subsequently, the GOI committed to providing financial support up to
approximately USD 167/kW to central government public sector units for setting
up large scale solar capacities with domestically manufactured panels (at around
% of the installation’ costs)� The government has termed this scheme ‘World
Trade Organization compliant’� Nineteen firms in India manufacture wind turbines
in the 225 kW to  500 kW range� Indian manufacturing – representing  capacity of
over � GW – caters to both domestic and global markets, providing systems to the
US and countries in the Middle East, South Asia, Africa and Latin America� As
average wind turbine size increases worldwide, Indian manufacturers are losing
their share of the global export market� Once  large player, their export share
of 12% in 2008, has since been on the decline� With the exception of one
manufacturing company, no other wind or solar manufacturer has any exports from
its Indian manufacturing base� powered by renewables by 2015� By 2020, 75% of
rural and 33% of urban stations will need to run on alternative energy

on renewable electricity, and India installed  417 wind water pumps that year

end-products of the spirits industry representing three-quarters (USDA, 2015)�
Its total fuel ethanol production ranks third among Asian countries, after China
and Thailand� India is also the world’ second largest sugar cane producer, and
sugarcane molasses is the main raw material for its ethanol production (USDA,
2014)� Meanwhile, national biodiesel production reached 135 million litres in
2015 (USDA, 2015)� Typically, vegetable oil, animal fats and used cooking oils
are used as feedstock for biodiesel production in India� Transport sector Global
fuel ethanol production reached 97 billion litres in 2015 (RFA, 2016), of which
India produced about 800 million litres or �%� By comparison,   The government
planned to achieve an ethanol blending mandate to 10% in 2015, up from just
under % today� Government-owned petroleum companies – known colloquially as oil
marketing companies (OMCs) – procured 550 million litres of ethanol in 2014,
slight increase from 475 million in 2013� If the mandate increase succeeds,
production could reach up to 700 million litres (USDA, 2014)� However, the goal
of achieving % blending was for 2013, and is only expect to be reached by the
end of fiscal year 2016, so achieving 10% looks unlikely in the near future
(Business Standard, 2016)� potential of 12� million� Solar heating, cooling and
cooking technologies are also used in the end-use sectors and there were about
70 concentrated solar cooking units, and 680 669 box type and 25 185 dish type
solar cookers in India� (MNRE, 2015a)� In 2014, total installed solar water
heating capacity reached �61 million m2 ( GW), and in that year, �53 million m2
capacity was installed� This was higher than the target of � million m2, but
lower than the achieved installations in previous years, which exceeded  million
m2� Eighty percent of the total capacity is installed in the residential sector,
14% in the commercial sector and % in the industry sector (MNRE, 2014b)� About
three-quarters of the total installed capacity is flat-plate collectors, the
other quarter is made up of evacuated tube collectors (ETC)� Solar water heaters
in India have an average capacity utilisation factor of approximately 14%� The
result is total generation of about  TWh per year of solar heat, which
represents about �% of the building sector’ total energy demand� Examples of the
use of solar thermal in Indian industry include plants in such large energy-
intensive industries as iron and steel or pulp and low-energy consuming textile
or food plants� In 2013, there were 28 concentrated solar thermal plants in
India for process heating:  new one was commissioned in October 2014 with  total
concentrator area of 450 m2 to provide process heat at 280 degrees Celsius ( )
for  drug processing company� There is growing government interest, largely
driven by air pollution, in electrifying transport� It has allocated USD 12�
million to accelerate the domestic production of electric and hybrid vehicles�
This, combined with renewable electricity, could result in increasing the share
of renewable energy in the national mix� In early 2015,  memorandum of
understanding was signed in the Punjab for constructing the first cellulosic
bioethanol plant in India, using paddy straw as  feedstock, with  total capacity
of 60 000 tonnes per year (75 million litres)� Using this straw for biofuel
production will minimise the environmental impact of burning it (Hindustan
Times, 2015b)� Heating and cooling sectors Bioenergy remains the main source of
renewable energy in Indian buildings and industry, but the consistency and
availability of data for the use of renewables in heating and cooling is mixed:
data is not available for the most recent years� Cooling is one of the largest
energy consuming applications in Indian industry, with  current demand of about
35 GW� It is traditionally provided by electric units, causing significant
spikes in electricity demand on hot days� Increasingly these units could be
powered by renewable sources such as wind and solar PV: electricity production
by the latter generally coincides well with cooling demand on hot days� Figure
11 gives an example of how cooling demand in New Delhi can result in an
increased electricity load of around  600 MW in summer compared to winter, and
this effect is expected to increase as demand for cooling in cities rises� By
2013, however, there were fewer than five concentrated solar cooling units in
India� According to the IEA (2015a),  total of � EJ of solid biomass was used in
India in 2012 –  EJ in the building sector and � EJ in the industry sector� The
bioenergy used in the residential sector, mainly for cooking, is defined as
traditional use of biomass (see the next section for  detailed discussion)�
Bioenergy represented 55% of the total final energy demand of the industry and
building sectors (excluding electricity use and the total energy demand of the
agriculture sector)� As of March 2013, there were �75 million biogas and manure
plants in India, about one third of the estimated   Figure 11: Hourly demand in

� Base year renewable energy situation In 2014 the shares are slightly different
from what they were in 2010, which is partly due to differences in sources for
statistics and energy growth� By then  larger share of the TFEC was consumed in
the building sector, with 40% in the form of fossil fuels and biomass, and % as
electricity� This shows the increasing use of electricity as electrification
increases� Modern fuels include liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)� The share of TFEC
consumed in industry also increases from 37% to 41% for fuels, and % to % for
electricity� Both agriculture and transport saw  decline in their relative
shares� The share of electricity in the TFEC was relatively low, so the
consumption of renewable electricity adds relatively little to the renewable
energy share when expressed in TFEC� Sector-level breakdown The REmap analysis
base year is 2010� India’ total primary energy supply was then 29 EJ (excluding
non- energy use of around � EJ) (IEA, 2015a)� In terms of final energy, this
translates to 17� EJ� The buildings and industry sectors accounted for 41% each
of this total, with 13% consumed by the transport sector and % by the
agriculture sector (Figure 12)� Electricity accounted for 12% of the TFEC�
Industry accounted for nearly half of the total consumption, with one-third
consumed in buildings and 18% by the agriculture sector, which for example,
requires power for irrigation pumps� Modern and traditional forms of renewable
energy accounted for 40% of the TFEC in 2010� Distinguishing between the amount
of biomass used in traditional versus modern forms is not easy, as little data
is available about whether the cookstoves currently in use are modern or
traditional� When traditional uses of bioenergy are excluded from the mix,
modern renewables account for 16% of TFEC (IEA, 2015a)� This TFEC breakdown has
changed in the past three decades (IEA, 2015a)� In the 1980s building energy
demand accounted for more than 60%, the industry sector’ share was about 25%,
and transport had  share of around 10%�  Primary energy supply refers to the
direct use or supply of all energy carriers ( crude oil) without their being
converted or transformed to another form of energy ( heat)� It is therefore
higher than TFEC, which only looks at the consumption of energy carriers such as
fuels for the transport sector or electricity for appliances (see footnote )�
Excluding the use of electricity, the share of renewable energy in India’
building sector was 84%� This is because of the significant volume of
traditional biomass used for cooking: when this is not counted as renewables,

Agriculture electricity Based on: IEA (2015a); MOSPI (2015) renewable energy
shares drop to %� By comparison, renewable energy use is 20% in the industry
sector, as  result of various forms of gasifier, residue boiler and other
specific applications (�� in small-scale steel mills)� Its share in transport is
negligible, but 13% of total electricity generation was renewable in 2010� is
related to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems (GOI,
2014b)� India has the largest air conditioning demand worldwide, accordingto
Davis and Gertler (2015), with an average of  120 cooling degree days8 (Pune,
for example, has  485 cooling degree days, Mumbai has  567) (GBPN, 2014)� Its
total potential cooling demand is more than 12 times higher than that of the US�
However, as in other low-income countries, the use of air conditioning is still
limited� The same study also shows that household income and space cooling
adoption are closely related, especially in warmer areas: ownership levels
increase by � percentage points per USD  000 increase in annual household
income� So demand for cooling – and the installation of equipment to meet it –
can be expected to increase significantly in the next few decades� India is
leading in renewables for industrial applications, but somewhat lagging in the
power and building sectors The building and industry sectors are equally the
largest energy users in India, each accounting for 41% of its TFEC� Cooking
accounts for the majority of total energy demand in both rural and urban areas�
Electricity demand has been growing at annual rates reaching more than 10% in
the past decade� In 2010, India’ building sector consumed 236 TWh electricity,
of which 72% was in the residential sector and 28% in the commercial sector�
Fans (34%), lighting (28%) and refrigeration (13%) account for three-quarters of
total power demand in the residential sector, while in commercial buildings 55%
of the total power demand India’ grid faces its peak at around  ��, and cooling
has  significant impact� Peak load in New Delhi, for example, is between - GW in
summer and �-� GW in winter� Cooling demand is % of summer peak load (Shah, Wei
and Phadke, 2015), and this peak will grow� The room air conditioner (AC) market
has grown from one million in 2003 to � million in 2012, with split units
accounting for three-quarters of the total� In 2010  The renewable energy share,
excluding power and district heat demand, provides the contribution of renewable
technologies in the sector’ total fuel use only� This is important to know to
exclude the effect of renewable power and district heating, which are often
outside the boundaries of end-use sectors�  Degree-day is  measure of heating or
cooling, which is the integral of  function of time that varies with
temperature�   AC use in urban households reached the low saturation level of %�
AC demand in India has been growing at around 20% per year in the past decade�
Estimates show that related electricity demand could reach 239 TWh/yr by 2030�
That would translate to  peak demand contribution of about 143 GW, or an
increase in units from around � million to 116 million� Three hundred new coal-
fired power plants of 500 MW each would be needed to power them� By contrast,
there is  potential to reduce the demand by 40% with efficient ACs: these could
reduce the need for 100 new coal-fired power plants, and have  peak-saving
potential of 60 GW (Phadke, Abhyankar and Shah, 2014)� in the congested western
and eastern parts of the country� Improvement in the rail sector, which will
shift freight traffic from roads to rail, and is one of the key determinants of
energy use in transport: efforts are ongoing, but are likely to take  long time�
Car ownership in major cities ranged from as low as 10 cars per  000 people in
Aurangabad to as high as 175 cars per  000 in New Delhi� Two-wheelers made up
75% of on-road passenger vehicles in 2011� Buses accounted for 75% of the total
road-based passenger activity� They are also responsible for half of the total
road passenger vehicle energy use, followed by cars/ jeeps and two wheelers,
which each account for 19% of energy demand (The Energy and Resources Institute
(TERI), 2015)� Air conditioning demand growth has averaged 20% over the past ten
years, and by 2030 the number of AC units is expected to increase from around
million today to 116 million Coal has played an important role in the Indian
energy industry� It made up 42% of the total primary energy supply in 2010 and
70% of it was used for generating electricity, accounting for two-thirds of the
total power generation of 960 TWh/yr� Generation from natural gas was 12% of the
total, while and nuclear and oil products each accounted for %� India’
industrial energy demand has been growing fast� Large shares of it come both
from bulk materials production – such as cement, steel and textile fibres – and
from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that produce various goods from food
products to textiles: indeed, much of India’ bulk material production is from
small-scale sectors� (The United Nations Industrial Development Organization,
(UNIDO) says there are 388 energy-intensive SMEs manufacturing clusters)� There
are also about 13 million micro, small and medium-size enterprises (MSME) in
India contributing about 45% of its total manufacturing output, and 40% of its
exports� Nearly 70 million people were directly and indirectly employed in SMEs
(Kumar, 2012)� Hydropower accounted for 70% of total renewable electricity
generation in 2010 Current issues faced by the Indian power sector include:
capacity shortages in the order of 15% of peak power demand and 10% of total
demand, with about 75% of all households being connected to the grid; regular
blackouts; structural under-investment; and market and institutional failures�
Besides, the average electricity price covers only  limited share of the average
production cost� As  result, power is not used efficiently, and is being wasted
– especially in the agriculture sector, where electricity is used excessively�
Furthermore, the conversion efficiency of Indian power plants is quite low: the
average gross efficiency of thermal power plants is about 30% or even less –
according to  time series analysis of the  period (Hussey et al�, 2014) – thanks
to the high ash content of India’ coal� The average age of the existing coal-
based power plant stock is 13 years, and larger new coal power plant capacity is
being rapidly added: the average capacity of the plants added in 2014 was 500
MW� These include an increasing number of new ultra large coastal power plants
burning imported coal with lower ash content and higher conversion efficiencies�
In 2010, more than 90% of the transport sector’ energy use was related to road
transport, with % related to railways� 85% of its passenger activity was related
to road transport with buses and omnibuses making up three-quarters of this
total� The share of cars was low, at approximately 10%� The remaining passenger
activity was largely related to rail transport, with aviation’ share remaining
less than % of the total� Meanwhile road accounted for 58% of freight transport,
with rail taking the remaining 42%� Every year India’ railways transport 927
million tonnes of freight and every day they carry 21 million passengers� is

efficiency of coal-based power generation is much lower than in other countries�
(based on the 2011 Indian census) mention that between two-thirds and 70% of all
households use traditional biomass� Traditional uses of biomass Three-quarters
of rural, and approximately 20% of all urban, homes in India use biomass fuel
(Fernandes and Mesquita, 2014)� The conversion to modern fuels has been
relatively high in urban areas: two-thirds of the urban households, according to
the 2011 census, used LPG for cooking: just % relied on crop residue and cow
dung cake� By contrast, 86% of rural households use firewood, cow dung cake and
crop residues� The largest populations relying on the traditional use of biomass
for cooking are found in the developing regions of Asia: by far the largest
number of these people live in India� The total population relying on
traditional biomass ranges from 700 million to more than 800 million (IRENA,
2013a)� Using biomass for cooking is inconvenient, and procuring the fuel takes
time and effort – while its use in traditional cookstoves imposes severe ill
effects on health� Women spend up to - hours per day in cooking, with 20% of
that time devoted collecting fuel� Four hundred million Indians (90% of them
women) are exposed to respiratory, pulmonary and vision problems associated with
indoor air pollution from burning biomass� The pollution causes 875 000 deaths –
and 16� million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs),  measurement of overall
disease burden – in India each year� About 525 000 of the total fatalities can
be attributed to acute lower respiratory infections, the other 350 000 to
chronic pulmonary diseases� One hundred and forty thousand children under the
age of five die each year from indoor air pollution related diseases (Dalberg,
2013)� Advanced biomass cooking stoves (or other options with clean fuels) can
avoid 570 000 premature deaths in India – as well as % of India’ total annual
GHG emissions (Venkataraman et al�, 2010)� It is vitally important to obtain
current, robust energy statistics for the traditional use of biomass and then
identify realistic potential for substitution� There is  particular need for
modern cook stove initiatives in Central and South India, where the scale and
intensity of solid fuel use for cooking is high (Dalberg, 2013)� India has the
world’ highest bovine population, which produces significant amounts of dung
(Ravindranath and Balachandra, 2009)� Wood and crop residues are other typical
biomass feedstocks (Mukhopadhyay et al�, 2012)� According to the IEA (2015a),
biomass accounted for around  EJ, or  quarter of India’ total primary energy
supply of 31� EJ per year in 2011� Eighty percent of this biomass use was in the
residential sector� In the absence of detailed information, the IEA defines this
as traditional uses of biomass burned in inefficient cookstoves or on open fires
mainly for cooking, but also for water and space heating� In most cases, such
biomass is unsustainably sourced� The main challenges now being faced by the
residential sector are access to, and the availability of, energy sources and
the efficient use of energy (TERI, 2015)� Average per capita expenditure on
cooking fuels has been increasing, on average, by % per year, in both rural and
urban areas� Cookstoves need to have region- specific characteristics to meet
needs (Dalberg, 2013)� Depending on cooking habits, India can be classified into
five broad food zones which determine heat density, the equipment required and
key cooking activities� Available data for traditional biomass use in India is
mixed� About % of the total population relied on solid fuels for cooking in
2010, and ten states account for three-quarters of the total solid fuel use in
India (Dalberg, 2013)� Three-quarters, or at least 700 million people, rely on
biomass for cooking and heating (Fernandes and Mesquita, 2014)� Other surveys
modern cook stove programme was started in India in the mid-1980s and reached
peak dissemination rate of about � million stoves  year in the mid-1990s� By
2003, 55� million modern cookstoves had been disseminated, mainly to rural
households� Some restaurants, hotels and other businesses used biogasifier
cookstoves that were as efficient as any cookstove� There are also biogas
plants, which burn  mixture of methane and carbon dioxide� Biogas, as  modern
form of biomass, offers socio-economic and environmental benefits (Minde, Magdum
and Kalyanraman, 2013) and by 2006, nearly  million biogas plants had been built
for cooking in  In 2011, the total population of India reached  190 million –
834 million living in rural areas� In the same year, the urban population was
358 million� There are 167 million rural households and 79 million urban ones�
This translates to  and � people per household in rural and urban areas of
India, respectively (Census Info India)�   households (Ravindranath and
Balachandra, 2009)� Comments by Indian officials, however, have pointed to only
million biogas plants -around half – still being in operation in 2014�  recent
announcement by software giant Infosys, which plans to build over  500 units in
the Ramanagara district of Karnataka over  10-year period, shows that the
potential of biogas is starting to be recognised (Economic Times, 2016a)� need
total energy of some 34 GJ� Total energy demand for cooking is lower in urban
areas at � GJ per capita or some 16 GJ per household of five� Useful cooking
energy demand, however, is between � and � GJ per capita so the efficiency of
cooking is % in rural areas and % in urban ones (van Ruijven et al�, 2011)�
Based on these capita demand values, the total energy demand for cooking in 2010
would be approximately  EJ� That would require �-� EJ of traditional uses of
biomass in 2011, assuming that % of all households require it (Daioglou, van
Ruijven and van Vuuren, 2012)� That, in turn, is % of the reported total use of
solid biomass use in the residential sector according to IEA energy balances
(2015a); hence around % of total solid biomass use would be in modern forms�
Traditional uses of biomass would be equivalent to - EJ in 2010� This report
assumes the lower end of this range for the year 2010� There is only  marginal
difference between solid fuel (firewood, charcoal) and modern fuel prices, with
solid fuels being slightly more expensive� However, the cost savings are
significant when the benefits of modern fuels are included (Dalberg, 2013)�
Biogas cookstoves are the most cost-competitive of all modern and traditional
uses of fuels, with levelised costs for household and community-scale ones
between 600- 900 INR/GJ according to the CEEW (2015b)� Firewood and LPG-based
cookstoves generate heat slightly more expensively, at between  000- 150 INR/GJ�
Electric and induction stoves are more expensive still, with costs in the range
of  550- 650 INR/GJ� Clearly biogas-based cookstoves are cheaper and, in view of
the availability of the resource, offer considerable potential in substituting
traditional uses of biomass� Heating and transport sectors Most of the use of
renewable energy in heating and transport is made up of biomass for cooking�
Next in importance are solar water heaters in domestic and industrial processes�
Their installed capacity in residential buildings reached  790 MW in 2010 (about
million m2) – mostly as flat-plate collectors ( 413 MW; AEE-Intec, 2012),
representing about 810 000 systems� India, with new capacity of 622 MW, ranked
fourth in annual installations worldwide in 2010, after China, Turkey and
Germany, and capacity factors reaching 14%� The yield from solar thermal has
reached � TWh per year, or �% of the Indian building sector’ Biogas offers
socio-economic and environmental benefits, and is  modern and clean alternative
to traditional cookstoves with great potential Per capita energy demand for
cooking – based on 2004 values (Shukla, 2004) – is approximately � GJ in rural
areas, meaning that  household of five people, would Box : LPG use and the role
of subsidies Domestic Indian consumption of LPG has grown strongly, with almost
45 million new connections installed between 2010 and 2013� However, the 2011
Census showed that only 70 million households out of the 110 million with
connections use LPG as their primary cooking fuel� The subsidy for supporting
this growth in LPG use stood at approximately USD  billion in the financial year
2013, but  study of who benefits from it shows that 50% of it goes to the top
30% of the population while the bottom 30% get only 15% (CEEW, 2014)� With more
than 70% of LPG distribution channels located in urban areas, about 50% of the
urban population use LPG as their sole cooking fuel, as opposed to just % of
rural people: yet 68% of the population lives in rural areas� While urban
consumption of LPG and compressed natural gas for cooking has been growing, the
use of electric kettles, electric water heaters, and induction stoves based on
electricity has also been increasing� If gas subsidies are withdrawn, there may
be  tendency to shift to using electricity in urban households, given the
availability of such electrical products in an ever-increasing consumer market�
total fuel demand� For comparison, energy demand for water heating in India from
all sources is about -% of the building sector total (GBPN, 2014)� power
deficit, and businesses are put at  competitive disadvantage as  result of their
need to pay for batteries and diesel generators for back-up power (Federation of
Indian Chambers of Commerce and industry (FICCI), 2013)� Residential buildings
represent more than 90% of the total installed capacity of solar water heaters
in India: the remainder is in applications in the industrial and commercial
sectors, which made up approximately 30 000 m2 of collector area representing
more than 150 systems, including process heat� India’ Arun dish- type
installations provide process heat at temperatures around 120o � Paraboloid dish
systems in  drug manufacturing company generate heat at 280o � Several other
similar technologies are used in the country’ manufacturing industry� Todays’
grid infrastructure challenges stem from the high growth rates in electricity
consumption by both industry and residents� The total length of transmission and
distribution lines grew by just 50% in  period, while total electricity demand
doubled� Over the longer term, peak load is expected to increase to 283 GW by
2022 and more than 600 GW by 2034 (CEA, 2015)� The lag in transmission and
distribution infrastructure is partly due to land acquisition or Right- Of-Way
(ROW) issues, which led to more than 120 transmission projects facing delays in
2011 (FICCI, 2013)� There were some 120 Indian distilleries in 2010 with
capacity to produce � billion litres of conventional ethanol production per year
to meet the demand generated by % blending with petrol� Its production is mainly
from sugar molasses: advanced bioethanol production is only in the & phase�
Production of biodiesel (from jatropha) was small, at just  million litres per
year: it is mainly used to replace replacement diesel in power generation and
heating, instead of as  transport fuel (USDA, 2011)� Relieving grid congestion
and improving the power grid infrastructure is  main priority for the central
government, which will need to work with  variety of actors to achieve its aims
(see Figure 13)� The “green corridors” programme, which will allow electricity
produced from renewables to be fed into the public grid, is one effort to
address this issue while enabling the scale-up of renewable energy� Funding is
being sourced for constructing transmission lines from international development
banks, including KfW, the Germany’ Development Bank, which recently concluded
USD � billion loan agreement to expand the grid with an Indian power
transmission company (KfW, 2014)� � Transmission and distribution grids
Reliable, affordable and secure electricity production is essential in ensuring
the continued growth of industrial and commercial activities and in satisfying
residents’ rising demands� However, India’ grid infrastructure is already
strained and in need of major improvements� Its transmission and distribution
losses are among the highest in the world, averaging 26% of total electricity
generation, and rising as high as 62% in some states� When such non-technical
losses as energy theft are included, total average losses are as high as 50%�
Billing efficiency is 55% and collection efficiency only 41%� Power producers
lose money as  result� Losses in distribution power lines also depend on the
system’ geographical spread: in extreme cases, such as in rural India, these may
exceed 30%, even 45% during peak load periods� The existing Indian Power system
is divided into five regional grids (Northern, Southern, Eastern, North-
eastern, and Western)� By the end of 2013, all these grids had been
interconnected through high-voltage transmission lines, but inter-regional
transmission capacity is relatively low compared to installed capacity: in 2012,
India had around 200 GW of power generation, but only 25 GW of inter-regional
transmission capacity (Lall, 2012)� In July 2014, total transmission capacity
reached 250 GW (MoP, 2014a) and inter-regional transmission capacity is expected
to reach around 65 GW in 2017 (PGCIL, 2012), by which time renewable energy
capacity (excluding hydropower) is estimated to be 83 GW (MoP, 2014a)� An
estimated 135 GW of non-hydropower renewable generation is expected in 2022 by
which time the Northern and Southern regions are expected to experience deficits
up to 20 GW (MoP, 2014a)� Power shortages resulted in  �% loss of GDP in 2012�
Load-shedding is common due to the peak   Figure 13: Overview of India’

Meanwhile, India is diversifying its power generation mix through growth in
biomass-based power generation, CSP, wind power and solar photovoltaics�
Renewable Energy Purchase Obligation (RPO) has been introduced, requiring power
distribution companies to buy -10% of their electricity from renewable sources,
or to purchase renewable energy certificates (REC)� Each REC, which can be
traded across the various States, stands for  MWh of renewable power generation,
and there is  separate market for Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SREC)� By
2014, some 15 million RECs had been issued: more than six million RECs had been
traded since the implementation of the REC mechanism, whose nodal agency is the
National Load Despatch Centre� Additionally, the Indian Energy Exchange that has
been in operation since 2009, offers day-ahead and longer term markets for power
providers, supplying around % of the country’ electricity consumption� It also
operates  Renewable Energy Certificate Market where RECs can be bought and sold�
Following the National Solar Mission, and the continued expansion of wind power,
the Indian Government asked the Power Grid Corporation of India (POWERGRID) in
2012 to assess the transmission infrastructure and control equipment needed to
achieve the added renewable power generation capacity outlined in the 12th plan�
The result envisioned 164 GW of wind and 35 GW of solar in 2030� The so-called
“Green Energy Corridor” report found that additional Intra-State Transmission
networks would be required to facilitate transfer of renewable power from
states10 rich in it to 10 Renewable energy rich States examined were Tamil Nadu,
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh�
others� It added that smart grid technologies – like forecasting methods,
STATCOMs, synchrophasors, dynamic compensators and switchable/controlled bus
reactors – would be required to maintain frequency and voltage, while renewable
energy management centres would need to be established to exchange data and
models to support the integration of renewables� The Indian Electricity Grid
Code is the right venue for addressing such topics as low voltage ride-through –
to provisions, voltage and reactive power (VAR) support, frequency and inertial
response support, and reserves response (NITI Aayog, 2015)� The Central
Transmission Utility (CTU), the CEA, and the Power System Operation Corporation
were identified as key stakeholders to examine the role of energy storage for
renewable energy grid integration� Table  provides an overview of the estimated
costs associated with different options for integrating renewable power
generation (Power Grid Corporation, 2012)� of renewable energy would be needed
to deal with the power surplus� On the policy and regulatory side, its report
recommended exploring energy storage options in more detail (TERI, 2015)� Since
then, the CEA has introduced connectivity standards for wind and solar PV
generation plants with requirements for harmonics, direct current injections,
flicker, fault-ride through, reactive power support, as well as active power
injection for those wind generation stations connected at higher voltage levels
(>66 kV) (CEA, 2013)� The CEA has also been examining additional strategies for
integrating large scale renewable power projects and has suggested that states
should set their renewable power purchase obligations according to their
capacity to balance the combined variability of load and renewable power
generation� States should examine technical and regulatory measures to enhance
the flexibility of conventional generation to increase balancing capacity, and
seek co-operation with the renewable energy management centres in renewable-
rich states to make optimal use of transmission infrastructure (CEA, 2013)�
India has also increased its Similar studies have been conducted at state level�
The State of Gujarat, for example, assessed the policy and regulatory challenges
needed to integrate up to 10 GW of solar PV and 35 GW of wind power into its
grid infrastructure� It concluded that interstate trading Box : Telecom towers
in India The Indian telecom industry has grown at an annual rate of 28% in the
last five years and the country now has about 740 000 mobile telephone towers –
60% of them in rural areas� Another 200 000 towers are expected by 2020� Rural
areas are expected to drive telecom sector growth� Of percentthe current towers,
70% have less than 16 hours of grid supply per day� Each consumes 6000 litres of
diesel per year to cover the remaining  hours or so that are unsupplied� In all,
telecom towers are consuming �12 billion litres of diesel per year� The Green
Telecom directive aims to address this challenge, and mandates: ● Making telecom
operators as of 2015 run at least 50% of all rural towers and 20% of the urban
ones on hybrid power (renewables technology or grid power); ● Increasing clean
energy implementation to 75% of rural towers, and 33% of urban towers by 2020;
and ● Enforcing  directive in line with the Government’ priority of decreasing
the fiscal deficit by cutting down the subsidy expenditure on diesel� Various
options exist for power supply to telecom towers, these include technologies
such as: grid + battery + distributed generation (DG); grid + Solar PV + battery
+ DG; or grid + Solar PV + battery + Fuel cell� The cost of power for many of
these systems would range between  INR/kWh (ICF, 2014)�   ambition for renewable
power generation since the ‘Green Energy Corridor’ report, and accelerated its
implementation (MNRE, 2014a)� China and is expected, from 2020, to be the
country most driving worldwide demand increases� India also imported � EJ of
coal or 20% of its total consumption; it used 70% in power generation and 10%
for steel and cement production� Demand is projected to double in the next
decade, with the structure of the coal market remaining similar, but coking coal
and power generation accounting for growth according to the Working Group for
Coal and Lignite in the 12th FYP)� The Ministry of Power is implementing an
Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) with funds to strengthen sub-
transmission and distribution networks in urban areas, to meter urban
distribution transformers/feeders/consumers, and to provide for the deployment
of solar panels, and smart grids (MoP, 2014a)� Meanwhile the Deendayal Upadhyaya
Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) programme has been launched to strengthen sub-
transmission and distribution networks, including metering, in rural areas (MoP,
2014b) Furthermore, the Cabinet approved the North- eastern Region Power System
Improvement Project (NERSPSIP) in November 2014 to strengthen the Intra State
Transmission and Distribution System (Business Standard, 2014): 19 GW of
additional transmission capacity is under construction, with another 21 GW
expected to be built before 2018� Demand for coal is expected to reach  300
Mt/yr (35 EJ) by 2025, with 15% of it (200 Mt) met by imports� Some assessments
expect this import volume to be reached as early as 2017 as domestic production
is not likely to keep up with growing demand (Krishnamoorthy, ��)� An energy
system that increasingly relies on coal will be subject to energy security
risks� Furthermore,  high demand for coal, and more imports, will bring India
larger energy bill� The high ash content of the type of coal used in India poses
multiple problems� Its calorific value is typically low, resulting in the
transport of large volumes and increased storage requirements� The efficiency of
coal- fired power plants is also low compared to the world average� Renewables
can help reduce both the growing dependency on importing coal and reduce
problems related to its use� Interconnector capacity with neighbouring countries
will also play an important role in strengthening India’ grid and improving
reliability and load factors while accommodating higher shares of renewable
energy: several neighbouring South Asian countries have abundant natural
resources and operate their grids in common frequencies and similar voltages� In
the Reference Case, India will consume one-third of global coal production in
2030 India has  total interconnector capacity of  416 MW with Bhutan, creating
major possibilities for importing hydroelectricity� Another  200 MW capacity is
planned, as is   517 MW interconnector capacity with Nepal� There is also, an
important opportunity to expand it to use Nepal’ hydropower potential� India has
no installed interconnector capacity with Sri Lanka, but  500 MW is planned for
the future (NEA, ��) India’ crude oil production has reached � EJ, and it
imports an additional � EJ� Annual production has been stagnant at �83 million
barrels per day (mbd) over past years� The import dependency of crude oil and
refinery throughput are 76% and 84�%, respectively� Imports are expected to
increase by 50% between 2012 and 2017 according to the 12th FYP (Krishnamoorthy,
��)� The country’ total natural gas production was � EJ, and it imported � EJ�
The consumption of natural gas, including LNG, is growing the fastest of all
fossil fuels, with demand increasing by 12% per year between 2007 and 2012�
(Krishnamoorthy, ��)� Its share in India’ total energy system is expected to
reach 20% in 2025, up from 11% in 2010� According to Natural Gas Vision 2030,
demand is projected to more than triple from 242 million cubic metres per day in
2012 to 746 million by 2030� The fertiliser sector’ present 25% share could drop
to 15% as  result of increasing demand from other � Conventional fuel markets
and short-term expectations India both produces and imports fossil fuels� It has
10% of global coal reserves, the 5th largest of any country in the world
(Krishnamoorthy, ��)� They are mostly in the eastern side of the country, which
is important since it necessitates transport links to other regions� Its coal
production reached 14 EJ (more than 550 million tonnes) in 2012� It has the
biggest coal demand after   sectors, such as other petrochemical production and
city gas, but mainly from power production� Domestic sources would account for
half of the total supply, with LNG (45%) and cross-border pipelines (%; �� from
Turkmenistan and Trans-Afghanistan) accounting for the other half by 2030
(Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), 2013)� gas (MNRE, 2014b)�
Coal will remain  key energy source in meeting rapidly expanding power needs
despite the apparent water conflicts� India is  relatively water-scarce country,
with only % of the world’ freshwater resources� Worldwide, about  200 new coal
power plants are being proposed representing nearly  000 GW of installed
capacity: Three-quarters of the total number of plants planned are in China and
India (Burt, Oris and Buchanan, 2013)� About one-third of the total capacity is
in India� The US Energy Information Administration estimates, India has more
than 250 trillion cubic feet of shale gas resources in four basins, equivalent
to more than  000 years of natural gas consumption based on today’ level of
demand� National oil companies are allowed to explore and exploit such
unconventional hydrocarbon resources (Krishnamoorthy, ��)� India also has an
installed nuclear capacity of  GW, with  plan to reach 60 GW by 2032
(Krishnamoorthy, ��)� Seventy-nine percent of India’ new energy capacity is
expected to be built in areas that already face water scarcity or water stress�
The country plans, for example, to build  cluster of 71 coal plants in the
Vidarbha region of Central Maharashtra,  highly water-stressed area where lack
of water for irrigation has been documented over the last decade� The Ministry
of Water Resources predicts that the national demand for water in energy
production will increase 16-fold by 2050� According to  study by an Indian
electricity regulator, the most water efficient technologies (dry cooling)
reduce consumption by 90% but result in an -% increase in the electricity
tariff� Increasing demand and reduced domestic production is causing all fossil
fuels to face import dependency in India� Crude oil has the highest share of
imports, at three-quarters of total consumption in 2010� The share of imports of
natural gas and coal were 22% and 13% of total consumption in 2013�  recent
study by TERI (2015), concludes that the average import dependence of fossil
fuels will increase from 40% in 2011 to 74% by 2030 under  business as usual
scenario, mainly driven by the tripling of dependency in both coal and natural
gas�  scenario that prioritises energy security through better energy efficiency
involves switching toward natural gas and higher shares of renewables� This can
help to limit the growth in import dependency to only 44% at the same time
period� Crude oil and coal dependencies would remain the same as now, though
that of natural gas would triple� Increasing the deployment of solar PV and wind
turbines reduces the water-intensity of electricity generation, and  recent
analysis for China demonstrates by how much� It shows that  combination of
improving plant cooling technologies and increasing renewables, based largely on
Solar PV and wind, can reduce the water- intensity of Chinese power generation
by as much as 42% by 2030 (IRENA and China Water Risk, 2016)� Though the study
focused on China, its conclusions can generally be applied to other countries
heavily reliant on coal for power generation, such as India� In the next 15
years, deployment of renewables will be key to securing India’ energy supplies
There are about 26 million pumps in Indian agriculture� At least 12 million of
them use grid-based electric motors and 10 million operate with diesel� The
number of electric tube wells (pipes bored into the ground that pump water to
the surface) has increased from 12 million in 2001 to nearly 20 million today�
Nearly 20% of all India’ power generation is used for agricultural water
pumping� When rainfall is low, water stress increases� India spends over USD
billion on energy subsidies annually, and farmers pay only an estimated 13% of
the true cost of electricity� With very low power prices, excess water use has
even further impacts, especially on groundwater resources� India is the world’
largest user � Nexus issues The interlinkage between water, energy and food
supply systems is  major consideration in India� With its growing population and
economy, demands for all three are increasing equally fast� The electricity mix
in India is dominated by coal-based power plants, followed by hydropower and
natural   of groundwater for agriculture: it accounts for nearly 80% of all
freshwater use� As groundwater levels drop, more power is needed to retrieve it,
thus increasing the energy intensity of extraction (IRENA, 2015b)� use, but it
also is more capital and energy intensive, may not be suitable for all
irrigation applications, and may reduce the replenishment of groundwater as
result of limited flow from seeps to aquifers� During 2014, the Government
undertook to install 100 000 solar water pumping stations for irrigation and
drinking water� In 2015, 22 000 were installed (MNRE, 2016a)� The Government has
also recently announced  piped water supply programme deploying 20 000 solar
pumps in select tribal and rural districts (IRENA, 2015b)� Replacing five
million diesel pump sets with solar systems could lead to savings of nearly 18�
GW worth of installed capacity, 23� TWh electricity, 10 billion litres of diesel
and 26 Mt of CO2 emissions� Renewables offer an important alternative for
agricultural pumping with multiple benefits (IRENA, 2016c)� The benefits of
large-scale deployment of solar pumps include expanding water services to
underserved communities and unirrigated lands, while reducing dependence on grid
electricity or fossil fuels� They also help to mitigate the local environmental
impacts of using diesel, enhance overall grid stability in agrarian economies,
and reduce the burden of electricity and fossil fuel subsidies� The technology
is mature and has been successfully deployed at scale� The types of biofuel
crops grown and their location in India, also makes  difference to overall water
use�  litre of ethanol made from irrigated sugarcane in India, for example,
needs more than 25 times as much water as one made from mostly rain-fed
sugarcane in Brazil� Approximately 93% of India’ sugarcane area is irrigated and
there little availability of land for rain-fed sugarcane production� In view of
these resource constraints, sugar cane may have limited potential for large-
scale biofuel production in India� Efforts to further increase its area and
production would undoubtedly intensify already severe competition for land and
scarce water resources� An alternative option, technologically similar and
proven for the production of bio-ethanol, yet agro-ecologically much better
suited to the Indian context, is producing ethanol from  feedstock of the stalks
of sweet sorghum� Unlike sugarcane, sorghum can be grown with good success under
rain-fed conditions in nearly all of the country, is drought tolerant and is
much less demanding on soils (IIASA, 2014)� On the other hand, there is also
evidence of risks posed by solar-based pumping� Since the operational cost of PV
pumps is negligible, and the availability of energy is predictable, they could
cause overdrawing of water� Many solar pumping promotion programmes package
financial support with the deployment of drip irrigation technology so as to
mitigate this risk� Drip irrigation technology can indeed improve the efficiency
of water Another interesting issue is how the use of biomass in rural areas
impacts food productivity and whether it can improve India’ food security�
Diverting cattle dung from farm manure to household cooking fuel, for example,
can reduce the amount of time spent on collecting and preparing traditional
biomass fuel� Additional research is needed on nexus issues like these�
DRIVERS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE CURRENT POLICY FRAMEWORK Key points carried
out by CEEW and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) estimates that more
than one million full time equivalent jobs will be created between now and 2022
by the solar deployment industry alone� Similarly, the wind sector would create
183 500 jobs by 2022, as its capacity increases to 60 GW� The job creation
potential of the renewable energy sectors is therefore significant, but it is
accompanied by an urgent, and currently unmet, need for training and skill
development� ● India’ widespread energy scarcity, and its vulnerability to
energy price shocks, have led to  long history of initiatives to promote
renewable energy� Also, reducing the environmental impacts of using fossil fuels
and climate change are increasingly main drivers of renewables in India� ●
installed India’ recent target of 175 GW renewable energy capacity is indicative
of its firm commitment to scaling renewables up� This ambitious target has led
to much enthusiasm in the market, and recent efforts are bearing fruit – such as
auctions for solar PV – but further efforts will be needed for its timely
realisation� India’ target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by
2022 was officially announced in the 2015 budget speech� As the country
approaches the next budget announcement, the country’ total installed renewable
energy capacity is close to 43 GW, nearly 25% of this target (MNRE, 2016b)�
Historically India has paid much attention to renewables in its energy policy�
In 1992, it was the first country to set up  ministry dedicated exclusively to
renewable and new energy sources (previously it had been  dedicated department,
which started operating in 1982)� Wind and solar technologies have been promoted
through various policies and measures in the past two decades, if with mixed
success� Figure 14 below highlights the timeline of the various policy measures
adopted, along with the growth of the country’ renewable energy capacity� ● The
drivers for renewables are different in India than in countries, which are
advanced in their use, such as the US and Germany, and even China� Some of
India’ socio-economic characteristics are unique� Its population, income levels
and, thus, energy demand are all projected to grow faster than in these
countries� The growing demand will need to be met, and the trend shows that
fossil fuels will meet more of it than renewables� ● India will be the world’
most populous country towards the end of this decade� By 2017 its population
will equal China’ and by 2030 it will be 18% larger than at present� More people
will live in urban areas by then: some 610 million compared to today’ 415
million, up from 32% to 40% of the population� That would mean building nearly
200 new cities of  million people each� Most of India’ population, furthermore,
is expected to be under the age of 30� Despite rapid strides in adding power
capacity, India continues to be plagued by widespread energy poverty�
significant proportion of its population lacks access to clean and affordable
energy� Estimates suggest that 80 million households, with more than 300 million
people, have inadequate access to electricity� Advances have been made in
extending the electricity grid across the country, but extending it to remote
and rural areas is often economically prohibitive and faces the persistent
problem of variable supply� Energy access is pivotal for holistic human
development and economic growth ● Given its population growth rate, India needs
to create ten million new jobs every year� Analysis   across the agricultural,
industrial and commercial service sectors� applications� Efforts to use biogas
effectively – and to extend the reach of the electricity grid to evacuate power
and distribute it to people in remote locations – are being undertaken� There
has also been  big push for decentralised energy systems powered by renewable
energy in the last decade� Renewable energy in India is seen as  supplement to
energy supply from other traditional sources in meeting rapidly growing energy
demand India’ widespread energy scarcity – and its vulnerability to energy price
shocks – have led to  long history of initiatives to promote renewable energy
India’ energy policy is primarily focused on bridging ongoing supply and demand
gaps, while bearing in mind the advantages from transitioning away from  mix
highly reliant on fossil fuels� Despite several pro-renewables policies in
place, however, the share of renewable energy has fluctuated between 13% and 19%
over the past years and has yet to make  dent in the share of electricity
generation from fossil fuels� In recent years, central and state governments
have adopted programmes that give impetus to the wind and solar markets,
including non-electricity driven India’ growing trend of policy focus on
renewables continues� In July 2015, MNRE released the draft National Renewable
Energy Act (NREA), which specifies the need for large scale consumption of
renewables� It also mentions that increasing the share of renewable energy would
require changes both in domestic energy policies and in the planning guidelines

announcement of India’ 175 GW renewable power target, and the release of
countries INDC   Macroeconomic Drivers system� The act promotes renewables in
line with climate, environmental and macroeconomic objectives and aims to reduce
India’ import dependency on fossil fuels and GHG emissions� India released its
INDC in October, 2015 with specific targets for deploying solar, wind and
biomass energy, and  collective target of 40% of power capacity from non-fossil
fuel sources� In early 2016, the country also amended its National Tariff Policy
(NTP), which aims to promote faster adoption of renewable energy and sourcing of
power through competitive bidding� Table  compares  number of socio-economic and
renewable energy indicators for India, China, Germany and the US to show how
their different population and economic drivers affect energy demand� The table
shows that India’ per capita income level is the lowest, but is expected to grow
quickly� Around 20% of its population currently does not have access to
electricity� Like China, it has  large share of traditional biomass, and has
experienced significant growth in energy demand over the last 10 years� The
table shows that India is unique among these major energy consuming economies in
some of its socio-economic characteristics, as well as having different drivers
than the US and Germany, and even China�11 � Drivers of renewable energy in
India Drivers for renewable energy vary from country to country� In China, the
main ones have been air pollution and local job creation� Phasing out nuclear
power is one reasonfor Germany’ energy transition� In the US, improving energy
security and cost-competitiveness were the main drivers for shifting to
renewables� The drivers behind India’ transition to  greater renewables energy
system are different again: as discussed above, they include economic growth,
energy access, energy security, and reducing the negative environmental impacts
of increased fossil fuel use, such as air pollution� Despite its growing energy
demand, India installs the least amount of renewable power generation capacity
each year of the countries shown in Table  (if hydropower is excluded)� China
has installed very much more renewable power than any other country in the
world, around 10 GW per year (excluding hydropower)� With its ambitious targets,
India is now aiming to use its rich renewable resource potential to catch up
with other advanced countries� 11 Table : Socio-economic and renewable energy

India can expect, identifying the major drivers for the country’ forecasted
growing energy demand� India will be the world’ most populous country towards
the end of this decade� By 2017 its population will equal China’ and by 2030
will be 18% larger than today� More people will live in urban areas by then:
some 610 million compared to today’ 415 million, up from 32% to 40% of the
population� That would mean building nearly 200 new cities of  million people
each� Most of India’ population, furthermore, is expected to be under the age of
30� India has already used most of its hydropower potential, and intends to add
the bulk of this non-fossil fuel capacity in the form of solar and wind power�
In China, large hydropower and nuclear together contribute 24% of its installed
capacity mix� That is significantly more than the % contributed by solar and
wind power, though their share is rising rapidly� In comparison, renewable
energy (excluding large hydro) contributes 13% of India’ installed capacity mix,
with large hydropower and nuclear together contributing 17%� India will add 236
GW of non-fossil-fuel capacity, compared to China’  GW, up to 2030, to reach
20% share of total primary energy demand� India’ total primary energy supply has
also been growing fast, increasing by 64% over the  period� By contrast, it has
declined in both the US and Germany� China’ growth was even higher, at 135%, but
in recent years it has been slowing down and this is expected to continue in the
short-term� By comparison, India’ energy demand is expected to double over the
2014 to 2030 timeframe, driven by increasing population and per capita income,
as well as the need to reach the goal of 98% electricity access� The growing
demand for power in India will need to be met by  combination of fossil fuels
and renewables� India is expecting to surpass China’ coal demand over the next
few years, and will require  power capacity of over 800 GW by 2030, up from
around 275 in 2014� It is to raise non-fossil-fuel capacity from today’ 84� GW
(37 GW of renewable energy, � GW of nuclear and 42 GW of large hydro) to 320 GW
in 2030� At present, non-fossil fuels contribute just over 30% of the total
capacity of 277 GW� As India’ total electricity capacity multiplies almost three
times over between now and 2030, non-fossil fuel capacity will have almost to
quadruple if it is to reach the target of  40% share of the total� In addition,
there are  host of policies which, if implemented, will enable the country
successfully to pursue sustainable development� They include reforming building
codes and rationalising prices in freight transport by eliminating subsidies
(Bloomberg, 2014b) and would complement current policy support for renewable
energy and energy efficiency� Indian manufacturing is being given  boost – under
the National Manufacturing Policy of 2011 and the “Make in India” programme
pursued by the current Government – so that it can contribute 25% of GDP in the
coming decade, up from 15% at present� This policy identifies focusing on
‘greener and cleaner’ technologies and local value chain creation as priorities�
It recommends that the green manufacturing committee applies objective criteria
to identify such technologies, consistent with the NAPCC� Similarly, the
National Solar Mission (one of the eight missions under the NAPCC) aims to
create  conducive environment for manufacturing in the solar energy sector, to
reduce the dependency on imports and to develop India as  solar energy hub�
Box : Renewable energy jobs in India Analysis by IRENA (2016d) estimates that
416 000 people work in the renewable energy industry in India� This excludes
large hydropower which is estimated to employ another 104 000� The solar PV
industry employs an estimated 103 000 people in grid-connected (31 000 jobs) and
off-grid applications (72 000 jobs)� The biogas sector employs 85 000 people and
the wind energy sector employs an estimated 48 000� India has the largest market
for solar lanterns, with an estimated 700 000 – 800 000 units as of 2010� About
40% of the 110 companies active in the solar portable light manufacturing
industry worldwide are headquartered in India and make up 30% of global sales�
(IRENA, 2013a)� Table : Estimated direct and indirect jobs in renewable energy

heating/cooling Wind Total Source: IRENA (2015c) India has an installed total of
� million family-size biogas plants (with - m3 capacity), making it  distant
second to China (MNRE and CII, 2010)� MNRE has estimated that available dung
could support some 12 million plants (Arora et al�, 2010)� Slightly more than
100 000 such plants were installed during the financial year 2008, saving 120
000 tons of fuelwood� The Government estimates that some 200 000 jobs could
eventually be created in the biogas sector, up from the present 85 000� An
assessment concluded in October 2010 that Indian manufacturers of biogas plants
were “steadily improving their technology and products, which has led to an
establishment of Indian companies in the global market� Thus, foreign companies
trying to break into the Indian market face strong competition from established
Indian companies in the Indian market who have knowledge of local conditions and
requirements�” (IRENA, 2013a)�  report by Bridge to India and Tata Power Solar,
concludes that there is  realisable potential of between 110 GW and 145 GW for
solar PV in India, which could create 670 000 jobs (India Today, 2014)� If India
achieves its new target of 100 GW of installed solar energy by 2022, as many as
� million full-time equivalent jobs could be created (IRENA, 2016d) – including
over 210 000 skilled plant design and site engineering jobs, 18 000 highly
skilled jobs in business development and over 80 000 annual jobs in performance
data monitoring� Another approximately 183 500 full-time equivalent jobs would
be generated if India were to reach its target of installing 60 GW of wind
energy capacity by 2022� Looking ahead, solar and wind companies in India can
support the clean energy market by reporting the numbers of jobs their projects
create (CEEW, 2015c)� Furthermore, the Government has been developing
international collaborations to enhance the transfer of clean technologies to
India� All these efforts are aimed at spurring local value creation and growth
in green jobs while pushing for local innovation� jobs by 2022 (CEEW, 2016)�
Unlike in other developed countries, where  transition to renewables may result
in job losses in the fossil fuel sector, the renewable energy sector in India is
supplementary to it and so generates new employment rather than redirecting it,
since renewable energy capacity is often in addition to that of fossil fuels�
However, developers do not report job numbers voluntarily, as in other
countries, so the absence of  clear mandate to do so by the Job creation is
major driver for policy makers around the world, and India is no exception� The
country could have over one million solar jobs and over 180 000 wind   Box : The
existing National Solar Mission The JNNSM (often referred to as the National
Solar Mission in this report) was launched in January, 2010 as one of eight
missions under the NAPCC� It originally set  target of deploying 20 000 MW of
grid connected solar power, and  000 MW of off-grid power by 2022, but this was
recently revised up to 100 000 MW� The mission aims at reducing the cost of
solar power generation in India in order to achieve grid tariff parity by 2022
through: long term policy; large scale deployment goals; aggressive &; and
domestic production of critical raw materials, components and products, The
National Solar Mission follows  phased approach that allows the government to
modify guidelines and policies based on the experiences gained and lessons
learnt in earlier phases� It has, thus far, successfully driven investment,
taking India from  cumulative installed capacity of grid connected solar
photovoltaic of nearly 10 MW in early 2010 to more than  500 MW by May 2014�
During its first phase (), more than 500 bidders competed for 63 projects
allocated during two reverse auctions, driving prices to record lows� New solar
energy investments in India increased to more than USD � billion in 2011� Phase
activities focused largely on achieving  000 MW of solar energy through an equal
split between solar thermal and solar PV project technology� Competitive bids
for the National Solar Mission projects have rapidly driven down tariffs� Phase
bids revealed prices as low as INR �49 (USD �15) per kilowatt-hour for PV
projects making it competitive with diesel-fired captive electricity generation�
Phase  of the National Solar Mission has set tariffs even lower, to stand at INR
�45/kWh (USD �09/kWh) with viability gap funding, and INR �75/kWh (USD �08/kWh)
with accelerated depreciation� Bids in 2015 and early 2016 all came in at around
INR �-�/kWh (USD �06-�07/kWh) indicating that prices are at the lower range of
the Mission’ target (Gambhir, 2016)� Figure 15: Solar PV bid price trend under

December-14 July-15 January-16 August-16 Note: Analysis based on MNRE, 2016c
Although Indian industries have responded positively to the Solar Mission, it
faces several hurdles in moving ahead, if it is to scale-up solar energy� The
central government — with co-ordinated action by states, developers, financial
institutions, manufacturers, research institutes, and communities — needs to
develop effective solutions for more credible project bids, enforceable RPOs and
RECs, strong financial structures, increased domestic manufacturing, and
reliable power evacuation and transmission�   The ambition of the programme has
been scaled up significantly, with India now targeting 100 GW of solar capacity
by 2022; 40 GW from rooftop solar projects, and the remaining 60 GW from utility
scale ones� The next phase of the National Solar Mission aims significantly to
increase annual installed capacity to reach the goal of 100 GW by 2022� Its
annual target has increased from  GW in 2015 to 12 GW in 2016� By 2017 annual
installations should amount to 15 GW, reaching 17� GW by 2021� (The targets
under each phase count total progress in installed capacity under both the
direct central government programme and the state programmes)� The level of
capacity installation growth is shown in Figure 16� Figure 16: Solar PV

(2016) Security of affordable energy supply central government creates
roadblock in analysing job creation� Despite the competitive direct costs of
fossil fuels, broad motivations for promoting renewable energy in India are
provided by such factors as exclusion for the poor (who either do not have
access to the energy markets or are unable to pay for energy services), the
instability caused in the energy market by fluctuations in energy prices, and
other real and potential market failures� Renewables are also increasingly
emerging as the least-cost option for meeting the country’ rising energy needs�
In India, as in other developing countries, public support helps to drive the
deployment of renewables and this, in turn, drives down their price and
encourages job creation across the value chain, such as in manufacturing,
installations, financing, and maintenance  broad motivation for promoting
renewable energy in India is to respond to  series of real and potential market
failures, in energy access, energy security, climate change, and local
environmental challenges Ensuring access to energy is central to India’ policy,
which aims to address the underlying demand for energy services� The household
sector consumes nearly   39% of the total energy supplied in the country:
significant proportion of this (around three-quarters) is provided by
traditional biomass based fuels – like firewood, dung cakes, and charcoal –
which are not accounted for in official statistics� This indicates the pressing
need for increasing access to modern energy sources for millions of Indians� by
history of policies and programmes aimed at enhancing rural electrification
going as far back as 1969 when the Rural Electrification Corporation was
established� The Corporation promotes and finances  wide range of rural energy
projects, including grid- connected, off-grid, renewables or conventional fuel
driven power generation, power conservation and power distribution network
initiatives� The energy policy also aims to cater for India’ growing energy
demand and domestic supply gaps� Even under an aggressive scenario of global
climate stabilisation, India would consume at least 60% more energy in 2035 than
today� Varying output from domestic fuel sources, volatile prices of imports and
uncertainty in geopolitical conditions, all lead to concerns about the
predictability and stability of fuel supplies� India has limited sources of
fossil fuels and is not geographically adjacent to any major sources of
supplies, making it vulnerable to geopolitical and geo-economic shocks� The
country’ energy security policy, therefore, needs to be viewed through  wide
lens, considering supply and demand issues from  planning and financial
perspective at both the micro and macro scale (TERI, 2015)� Renewable energy
should be considered as  viable alternative that can mitigate this risk, at
least in part, and offer the double advantage of allowing energy access to the
poor and aiding energy security by diversifying the sources of supply� The
pursuit of energy access and energy security enjoys considerable political
support, and is recognised in the Integrated Energy Policy (IEP), which
considers energy security as providing all Indians with an energy lifeline,
regardless of their ability to pay for it� This is supported Box : Climate
Change India now accounts for % of total global CO2 emissions, making it the
world’ third largest national emitter, after China (23% of the global total) and
the US (16%) (this excludes the EU-28 which accounts for 11%)� It will also play
key role in reducing the growth of global CO2 emissions� It released its INDC in
October, 2015, pledging to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33% to
35% of the 2005 level by 2030� It realises that its ambitious renewable energy
targets will help to reduce emission growth, but is nevertheless simultaneously
expanding its coal mining activities, the largest contributor to its increasing
emissions (Reuters, 2015), mainly because it needs to grow its economy (CEEW,
2015a)� India still needs to provide energy access to  quarter of its
population, and will try to do this at the least cost, so as to provide
affordable electricity� Renewables can play an important role in realising this
objective if deployment starts now and their cost-effectiveness improves�
Otherwise, there is  risk that coal will continue to be used for meeting the
exponentially growing electricity demand� So far, the contribution of
manufacturing industry to India’ economy is less 25% of GDP, much lower than in
China, for example� It will have to grow at much higher rates if India is to
overcome its development challenges, and will thus increase the country’ energy
demand and related emissions� Renewables offer industry an alternative to fossil
fuels, and India is one of the world’ frontrunners in deploying solar thermal
energy and various forms of biomass for process heat� If such practices can be
significantly expanded to cover increasing demand, emission growth can be
reduced while the economy expands� Various analyses (�� CEEW, 2015a) show that
India could increase its renewable energy ambition significantly by 2030 to meet
its growing energy needs, while reducing emissions� The country would, however,
need to consider the related costs of realising such targets while ensuring it
overcomes its development challenges� So any commitment to climate change must
be built on technology partnerships and financial mechanisms�   Environmental
Concerns and Climate Change to INR 400/tonne (USD ) in the 2016 period (Economic
Times, 2016b)� Climate change mitigation in India, as in most countries around
the world, is addressed by such measures as end-use energy efficiency and
pursuing renewables� The country’ INDC includes  commitment to decrease the
emissions intensity of its GDP by 33% to 35% from 2005 levels by 2030 (see box
)� India launched its NAPCC in June 2008, setting out eight ‘missions’ to
support action: the most prominent are the National Solar Mission (see Box ) and
the Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency� The NAPCC was seen as  way to
connect climate change mitigation and energy security, and to pursue both goals
collectively� An analysis of Indian and global governance highlighted the
availability of  vast market for future investment in clean technology and
corresponding need to deepen bilateral relations to develop, and secure access
to, energy and climate related technologies� � Key characteristics of the India’
energy policy framework India’ target of 175 GW installed renewable energy
capacity by 2022 is indicative of its firm commitment to scaling it up� This
target has led to much enthusiasm in the market, and recent efforts are bearing
fruit – such as auctions for solar PV – but further efforts will be needed for
timely realisation of this ambitious target� Governmental policies need to be
strengthened in order to tackle problems of policy uncertainty, governmental
clearances, availability of finance, health of the transmission and distribution
networks, and financial health of the state electricity boards, if the country
is realistically to pursue the target� Local environments, in  country greatly
reliant on coal- based thermal power, are plagued with multiple issues beyond
the challenge of climate change� These include air pollution (see box ), related
respiratory diseases and water pollution (New York Times, 2015)� Renewable
energy deployment has gained impetus from growing civil society opposition to
the local environmental impacts of coal-based power� Environmental Impact
Assessments (EIA) have been prevalent in India since the late 1970s and the
Environmental Protection Act has been in place for 30 years (since 1986)� An
amendment to the act in 2006 excluded wind and solar projects from EIA
requirements in order to accelerate renewable energy� The feasibility,
efficiency and effectiveness of governmental policies depends on the
characteristics of the national energy policy system of governance� Policies
applied in China, Europe, or the US are not directly applicable to India�
However, adopting general recommendations and lessons from countries at more
advanced levels of renewable energy adoption is possible, helpful and ongoing�
In setting its targets, India has drawn from the experience of countries around
the world that have scaled up renewable energy by relying significantly on
rooftop solar systems: thus the 100 GW solar target contains  40 GW solar
rooftop sub-target� This indicates how policy lessons are transferable, even if
the modalities of implementing them with support policies like FiTs, net
metering policies or financial support schemes are unique to each country� In
late 2015, the Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests announced stricter
standards for coal-based thermal power generation so as to minimise pollutants�
These revised standards are to be implemented in  phased manner, based on the
age of the coal power plant, with three groups: those installed before 2014;
those installed from ; and those installed after 2016� The new standards aim to
reduce emissions of PM10 (maximum emissions of �98 kg/MWh), sulphur dioxide
(maximum emissions of � kg/MWh) and nitrogen oxide (maximum emissions of �
kg/MWh) (MOEF, 2015)� Water consumption in new plants will be limited to �
litre/kWh (Gambhir, 2016)� The clean energy tariff on coal will increase from
INR 50/tonne The government’ ambitious renewables target can easily be achieved
if some of the key issues faced by the private sector are addressed� However,
the process of doing this is complex, as in most countries, and is often drawn
out over  long period� Policy initiatives have been put in place at the central
and state levels for both grid-connected and off-grid renewable energy� Scaling
up the renewable energy sector hinges on the combination of funding mechanisms,
legislative frameworks, institutional arrangements, and other efforts which work
together to support implementing strategies, policies and programmes�   Box :
Economic impacts of fossil fuel combustion related air pollution in India The
economic cost of outdoor air pollution health impacts has reached % of India’
GDP (World Bank, 2013b) and the estimated number of deaths from ambient air
pollution (related to PM and ozone) reached 700 000 in 2010, up from 692 000 in
2005� The Global Burden Disease report has estimated that there are 620 000
premature deaths in India from air pollution-related diseases each year (Down to
Earth, 2013)� The Years of Life Lost (YLLs) from air pollution reached 18
million in 2010, while the DALYs reached 19 million (OECD, 2014)� DALYs from
indoor air pollution from biomass combustion stand at � million Coal used in
power generation is alone estimated to shorten life expectancy in India by �
years on average, according to  study that modelled its effects (Burt, Oris and
Buchanan, 2013)� Changing climate trends and air pollutants also hit
agricultural yields� According to Burney and Ramanathan (2013), they had reduced
yields by 36% by 2010, and by as much as 50% in densely-populated areas� Fossil-
fuel based heat and power and transport results in outdoor and indoor air
pollution� Emissions of fine particulates are some five times higher than the
recommended threshold� Domestic sources and waste burning contribute % of total
urban air pollution (Dalberg, 2013)� Traffic growth is the main driver of
deteriorating air quality (OECD, 2014)� India has been adopting Euro vehicle
classes quite ambitiously – Euro  had been adopted in 13 major cities by 2009
(UNEP Risoe, 2013)� Half of the 180 cities monitored in 2010, and 60% of their
population, are exposed to critical levels of PM10 emissions� Air pollution is
increasing in large and small cities alike, thanks to both transport and other
emission sources like coal combustion for power generation and polluting
industries such as ceramics next to densely- populated areas� One reason that
emissions are rising so fast is that rather old emission standards are still in
force in India (New York Times, 2012), though new standards are coming into
effect� Varying climatic and geographic conditions over India’ large territory
mean that the economic costs of health impacts vary from place to place� New
Delhi, for example, has an air pollution problem when diesel heaters start
operating, making it one of the world’ most polluted cities in winter�  huge
cloud of pollution cloud stands in front of the Himalayas, whereas the effects
of coastal coal plants is rather limited since wind disperses their emissions�
Burning biomass is  prime source of both indoor and outdoor pollution� India,
concludes  study by Yale and Columbia universities that assessed 132 countries,
has the worst air pollution in the entire world� Its high PM2� levels are about
five times above the threshold considered unsafe for human beings� PM causes
acute respiratory diseases – the most common causes of deaths in children under
five in India (NY Times, 2012) – and is linked to cancer� The benefits of
cleaning up coal power plants are 25 times higher than the costs (Burt, Oris and
Buchanan, 2013)� Markandya et al� (2009) found much higher benefits from
mitigating carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector in India (USD / CO2)
than for the EU and China (in the order of - USD/ CO2), but this includes
savings from  switch to renewables, which also offer significant benefits�
shift from burning coal to generate electricity will reduce both greenhouse gas
emissions and fine- particulate air pollution� Several studies have estimated
the probable health benefits� Roughly 90 000 premature deaths could be averted
in India every year (Haines, et al�, 2012)�  theoretical case study suggested
that  programme providing 150 million low-emission household cookstoves over
decade would provide 87% of Indian households with clean combustion, either
through advanced biomass stoves or through graduating to clean fuels� By 2020,
some 240 000 children under  years would be saved from death from acute lower
respiratory infections, and more than � million premature adult deaths from
ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would be
averted� The total savings for the decade would amount to 55 million DALYs, an
average of � million DALYs per year (Wilkinson et al�, 2009)�   The key
legislation guiding the development of renewable energy in India is the
Electricity Act, 2003, which, amongst others, mandates the State Electricity
Regulatory Commissions to promote generating electricity from renewable sources
by providing suitable measures for connecting to the grid and selling
electricity to any person and also specify, for purchase of electricity from
such sources,  percentage of the total consumption of electricity in the area of
distribution licensee� The Ministry of Power is responsible for the
administration of this Act and the Energy Conservation Act 2001 and for
amendments to them� The NTP of 2006 directs States to fix minimum percentages
for purchasing renewable power and – as amended in early 2016 – to promote
faster adoption of renewable energy and power sourcing through competitive
bidding� Procuring renewable power for future requirements is to take place
through such  bidding process� MNRE released bidding documents for grid-
connected renewable energy in December 2012 after several rounds of
consultations with stakeholders� India� The National Institute of Solar Energy
(NISE) – an apex national & institute – has testing facilities accredited by the
National Accreditation Board for Laboratories (NABL) for solar PV modules,
lighting systems, batteries, water pumping systems and small and large solar
thermal systems� Similarly, MNRE set up the National Institute of Wind Energy
(NIWE) for wind energy technologies� The Sardar Swaran Singh National Institute
of Renewable Energy is focused on solid, liquid and gaseous bioenergy, biofuels
and synthetic fuels for transport� Also the Alternate Hydro Energy Centre (AHEC)
provides expertise in developing small hydropower in hilly areas� (SERCs) State
governments have nodal agencies and departments operating under their purview
for effectively implementing all renewable energy and cogeneration schemes�
These promote local renewable energy deployment by channelling subsidies from
the centre� The MNRE provides them with grants for their recurring and non-
recurring expenditure� Financial assistance to renewable energy projects is
provided through the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) – the
financial arm of the MNRE, operating like  green bank – which provides loans and
channels funds and other initiatives (TERI, 2014)� It is registered as  non-
banking financial company and arranges its resources through market borrowing
and lines of credit from bilateral and multilateral lending agencies� The
National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) –  development bank
set up by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) – channels money received from Finance
Ministry or MNRE to rural areas for developing off-grid solar power generation
and applications related to rural development� Rural banking arms of various
private banks also actively finance developing small and large scale renewable
energy projects� The allocation for solar power has already taken place through
competitive bidding, under the National Solar Mission and state solar policies,
but these guidelines seek to also cover all other renewable energy sources, such
as wind, small hydropower, geothermal, biomass, and tidal energy� They seek to
create competition in the grid-connected renewable energy sector, to bring
transparency and fairness in allocation, to reduce information asymmetries among
bidders, to achieve standardisation, and hence to reduce ambiguity in the whole
process of project allocation (TERI, 2015)� Multiple agencies are involved in
India’ renewable energy sector� At the centre, the MNRE is the GOI’ nodal
ministry for all matters relating to new and renewable energy, with the broad
aim of developing and deploying them to supplement the country’ energy
provision� It also conducts resource assessments for renewables and supports &
in renewable energy technologies and has initiated programmes to support grid-
connected power generation and off-grid standalone micro-grid generation, to
demonstrate technology and to develop human resources� The Government of India
has also get up  commission called NITI Aayog (formally the Planning Commission)
which looks into various aspects of the Indian economy� In 2015 it released
Report on India Renewable Electricity Roadmap 2030 (NITI Aayog, 2015) which aims
to accelerate renewable electricity deployment� While the report does not detail
targets or an estimated energy mix for 2030, it does have  thorough discussion
on policy, finance and grid integration issues related to vigorous deployment of
renewable electricity� The Ministry has also formed independent and
collaborative institutes to promote the research and enhancement of renewable
energy technologies in   Box : International Solar Alliance The International
Solar Alliance is  platform to bring together countries with rich solar
potential, along with solar innovators, developers, and financiers� It aims to
aggregate demand for solar energy across member countries, thus creating  global
buyers’ market, and thereby reducing prices, facilitating the deployment of
existing solar technologies at scale, and promoting collaborative solar & and
capacity� Countries around the world are adopting and advancing their targets in
order to transition to  solar-rich energy future while international, national
and regional organisations are working to support governments to advance
development and deployment� There are, however, three important roadblocks in
the way of rapidly scaling up solar energy: ● The high cost of financing solar
in many regions; ● The speed, scale, and skill requirements of deploying
available solar technologies; and ● The ‘solar technology trap’ of becoming
overcommitted to  particular technology� The International Solar Alliance will
accordingly focus on: ● Helping to coordinate action to lower the cost of
finance for each type of solar energy, whether industrial captive power,
commercial rooftop, residential rooftop, rural off-grid solar, or utility scale
solar; ● Simultaneously experimenting with and replicating various business
models and tailoring action to the needs of countries, so as to allow rapid
scaling up with the most suitable business and financial model, and an easily
available trained technical and managerial workforce; and ● Promoting the
development of strategic and collaborative solar & so as to avoid getting locked
into  single type of technology� Encouraging and rewarding & advancement in
future and related technologies to improve the efficiency and integration of
solar power, as well as to increase the number of available solar applications�
Encouraged by the success of the National Solar Mission, several states
announced their own state solar policies and programmes (though Gujarat took
lead in announcing its solar policy  year before the Mission)� State policies
are broadly aligned with the Mission’ objectives, though there are some
differences: several state policies, for example, have not followed its approach
of mandating domestic content requirements for projects� India has also
spearheaded the creation of the International Solar Alliance, expected to begin
operations in late 2016, to further promote solar energy in the country and
worldwide (see Box )� renewable energy� It mandates SERCs to fix quotas for the
percentage of electricity being handled by the power utilities so as to procure
power from renewable energy sources� It requires SERCs to determine the tariff
for all renewable energy projects across their states and to ensure connectivity
to the grid for project sites in remote locations and far from major load
centres� The Act necessitates the preparation and notification of  National
Electricity Policy,  Tariff Policy and,  Grid Code, so as to use the country’
energy resources optimally� These are periodically amended and updated in order
to stay relevant to the constantly changing energy portfolio� � Overarching
power generation and transmission policies The Electricity Act also stipulated
that the CEA prepare  National Electricity Plan� The Plan would be for  short-
term framework of five years while giving  15 year perspective that includes:
short-term and long-term demand forecasts for regions; suggested areas or
locations for capacity additions in generation India’ Electricity Act of 2003
paved the way for regulatory interventions, which supported and accelerated the
development and deployment of   and transmission; outlining areas where
improvement of the transmission system could occur and where development of
national grid, efficient generation,  better transmission and distribution could
be implemented; and finally what types of fuels should be chosen based on
economic, energy security and environment considerations� The first plan with
five- year perspective was notified in 2007, and released several years later�
The second plan (the latest) was notified to be in preparation in 2013, and the
first draft volume focused on generation (the second volume focus is on
transmission) was released in December, 2016 (MoP, 2016)� It assesses the peak
load and energy requirement for the period , and provides  perspective forecast
for the  period� different energy sources� It emphasises the need to step away
from capital subsidies towards performance incentives, such as  tradable tax
rebate certificate (TTRC) that could be based on actual energy generated� It
also suggests that power regulators create alternative incentive structures such
as mandated feed-in laws or differential tariffs to support utilities in
integrating power from renewable energy sources into their systems� Several
states are moving in this direction with the development of net-metering
policies and FiTs: at least  (of 29) states have announced net-metering policies
in support of distributed renewable energy� Other approaches that assist in
supporting decentralised renewables (�� rooftop solar PV) by providing subsidies
to lower capital expenditure are also being pursued, while policies that support
self-consumption are also being implemented� The IEP envisions  limited role in
power generation for renewable energy sources, with them only providing -% of
electricity in the grid as late as 2032 –  share that was already exceeded by
2010� The policy also suggests that they would only prove  crucial component to
India’ energy independence beyond 2050� However, other policies and recent
initiatives by both the central government and some state governments like those
in Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu, indicate the growing role of renewables
in the energy mix� The National Electricity Policy calls for better use of non-
conventional energy sources, including solar and wind, for additional power
generation capacity, and recognises the need to reduce the capital costs of
renewable energy projects by promoting competition� The NTP mandates SERCs to
fix  minimum percentage of RPOs from renewable energy sources, taking into
account their availability in the region and the impact on retail tariffs and
procurement by distribution companies at preferential tariffs that the SERCs
determine� The policy was amended in January 2011 to prescribe that solar-
specific RPOs be increased from  minimum of �25 % in 2012 to % by 2022 – and was
further amended in early 2016 to enable faster promotion of renewables to meet
the country’ recent targets� The NAPCC – announced by the GOI on 30 July, 2008 –
outlined eight national missions to achieve  low-carbon growth path Missions on
Solar Energy, on Enhanced Energy Efficiency, on Sustainable Habitat, on
Conserving Water, on Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem, on creating  “Green
India”, on Sustainable Agriculture and, finally, on establishing  Strategic
Knowledge Platform for Climate Change� The Indian Electricity Grid Code (IEGC)
2010 was developed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC),
which lays down both the methodology for scheduling wind and solar energy and
basis for compensating the states with  large wind and solar energy potential
for dealing with the potentially large degree of variability in generation� This
is done through  renewable regulatory charge operated through the Renewable
Regulatory Fund (RRF) mechanism� The Code stipulates that power system operators
(state/regional load dispatch centres) shall make all efforts to evacuate the
available power from renewable energy sources� Government targets include the
100 GW solar PV and 60 GW wind energy goals to be achieved by 2022, plus targets
for biomass (10 GW) and small hydropower ( GW)� However, the decade-long Remote
Village Electrification Programme (RVEP) – under which solar home lighting
solutions were distributed to about 10,000 villages – was discontinued in 2012�
Some of its systems are suspected of having fallen into disuse, and batteries
will reach the end of their useful lives and will need to be replaced� Whilst
several policies have an impact on – and encourage – rural electrification, no
replacement for the programme has yet been introduced� The IEP, formulated by
the Planning Commission of India in 2006, provides  broad framework for all
policies governing production, distribution and use of   As one of its
strategies to combat climate change, NAPCC envisages renewable energy as
constituting around 15% of India’ total final energy mix by 2020� To achieve
this,  minimum share of renewable energy is pegged in the national grid at %,
starting in 2009 and this is to be increased by % per annum so as to reach 15%
by 2020 (MNRE, 2016a)� (As noted earlier in this section, the NAPCC targets are
not in alignment with those already-realised in the IEP)� Another clean energy
initiative under the NAPCC includes promoting trade in RECs across states in
order to increase compliance with RPOs� from the energy sector� This indicates
the urgent need for policy mechanisms to encourage the uptake of renewable
energy in transport while reducing increasing reliance on imported petroleum
fuels� India has the largest light-duty vehicle fleet in the world without
efficiency or CO2 emission standards� The country’ Bureau of Energy Efficiency
has, however, proposed instituting new Corporate Average Fuel Consumption
standards, which could result in higher fuel efficiency for the light-duty
fleet, mandating  14% increase in fuel efficiency by 2016, and additional
increases in discussion could require  further 38% increase by 2021� While the
use of renewable fuels for transport is still at  very nascent stage, the
government has developed policies, through several different agencies, to
support its uptake� The Indian Ministry of Railways launched  ‘Vision 2020’ plan
in December 2009 proposing that  target of 10% of the total energy consumed by
the Indian railways should be sourced from renewables� However, no significant
progress has been made in reaching this target, though pilot projects at railway
stations, railway signals and level-crossing gates are underway� � Heating,
cooling and cooking policies  large proportion of the policies aimed at
renewable energy integration in India are focussed on power generation, but
renewables offer  suite of other applications, particularly for heating,
cooling, cooking and mechanical operations, and these would greatly enhance the
acceptance of renewables amongst the population of the country at large� The
Ministry has also entered into  joint venture with RITES Ltd�, so as to set up
railway energy management company to undertake projects harnessing renewable
power� These include solar and wind power plants, power trading activities,
transmission lines and power evacuation planning, energy conservation
initiatives, efficient co-ordination in power generation through captive power
plant, and energy audits� The company will also facilitate faster execution of
renewable energy and energy conservation works with the aim of reducing of
Indian Railways’ energy bill� Similarly, the Ministry of Heavy Industries &
Public Enterprise launched  ‘National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020’ in
August 2012� This includes interventions to reduce dependence on fossil fuels
and promote the transition to electric vehicles powered by renewable energy�
Advances on electrifying vehicles have so far been limited� MNRE provides policy
support for various renewables, bearing in mind the substantial scope of such
non- electricity applications in providing energy to people on both small and
large scales� Schemes run by both the central and state governments include
capital subsidy for solar water heaters as part of the NAPCC, subsidies under
the national solar mission for solar desalination systems, and policy support to
wind desalination systems through the MNRE programme on small wind energy and
hybrid systems� India has local, state and regional programmes to support clean
cooking, and is working with such international organisations as the Global
Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to help promote greater adoption of modern and
clean forms of cooking� Some important renewable sources have largely been
overlooked: there are, for instance, no support policies for geothermal cooling
systems� � City and state level policy making for renewables � Transport
policies India’ transport sector is  major energy consumer, accounting for more
than half of the country’ total petroleum consumption and  quarter of its total
energy� It accounts for about 13% of the carbon emissions Some of the support
framework required for up scaling renewable energy in India has to be provided
at state level� State nodal agencies have been set up to implement the policy
measures determined nationally   by the MNRE and to decide additional state-
specific policy that promote implementing renewable energy projects� The states,
however, often tend to support incumbent energy actors and their state-level
public utilities, and to subsidise power for consumers� They also determine how
to implement national policies, and this can result in big differences in how
programmes are administered� An overview of some states’ renewable policies show
how important, and dynamic, such local policy implementation can be� (in the
form of developed land, water, gas availability and access roads, and power
transmission systems) to set up solar power generation plants by private
developers� The advantages of solar parks include: ● Reductions in the cost of
solar power by providing economies of scale in procurement, the acquisition of
permits, and the development of power; ● Reductions in the risks of project
implementation for developers and the expedition of project execution; and So
far ten Indian states have announced their own solar policies� The Rajasthan
Solar Policy, adopted in 2011, is indicative of the type developed and
implemented by various states� Targeting 700 MW of solar power by 2017, it is
administered by the state nodal agency – the Rajasthan Renewable Energy
Corporation Limited� It provides  preferential tariff, and promotes developing
solar parks, setting up an infrastructure development fund, providing government
land at concessional rates, it also provides exemption from the cost of
electricity transmission and single window project clearance� Similar policies
have been adopted by Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Jharkhand� ● Preserving grid
connectivity, which has not emerged as  major issue in Gujarat and Rajasthan
(where the majority of solar PV is being deployed) partly because of the states’
approach to using solar parks� There is also  large push to promote solar in
urban areas� Developing solar cities has been an active policy in India since
2008: over 60 cities and towns take part in the “Solar Cities” programme (see
Box 10)� Many programmes and financing options are available level, as discussed
both centrally and at state earlier in this chapter� These can include income
tax breaks, accelerated depreciation, tariff payments for renewable generation,
import concessions, and other generation-based incentives� Many cities are also
adopting approaches to support renewable energy and improvements in energy
efficiency improvements through additional measures� Tax rebates are commonly
offered by local authorities� Such cities such as Thane, Amravati, Durgapur and
Navi Mumbai have property tax rebate programmes ranging from % to10% to promote
either renewable energy or energy efficiency� Many municipalities also have
green building incentives aimed at encouraging designs that include highly
efficient building envelopes and integrate solar thermal and solar PV� (ICLEI,
2013)� An Energy Service Company –  specialised service provider offering  range
of energy solutions together with planning, designing and implementing energy
efficiency projects – can agree to various types of performance contracts for
projects� Besides improving energy efficiency, typical Energy Service Company
projects can also include integrating solar water heating, or biomass/biogas
steam generators� Finally, municipal bonds form one of the most common methods
for local municipalities to Key provisions that states have made for solar and
wind policies include topics relating to land acquisition� Conducive state land
allocation policies can help it emerge as  favoured destination for renewable
energy, while unfavourable acquisition policies can discourage investments in
clean energy projects� Examples of conducive land acquisition policies include
the Rajasthan State government allotting land to wind and solar power developers
either on lease, or at  concessional rate of 10% of the market rate, in 2011 and
2012� Gujarat introduced provisions for allocating the state’ vast tracts of
wasteland for wind installations in its Wind Power Policy of 2013� On the other
hand, West Bengal’ policy of allocating state-held land through competitive
bidding, for example, has hindered attracting investments in wind-farm projects�
Solar Parks are another approach� State determined policies on large solar parks
can be designed as  package deal, enabling project development timelines to be
streamlined by allowing government agencies to undertake land acquisition and
seek necessary permits, and also providing  dedicated common infrastructure
support renewable energy� Issuers can include cities and regions, redevelopment
agencies, districts, and publicly owned airports or other entities and the
interest earned on the bonds is typically free from federal income tax� Box 10:
Solar Cities Local politics drives much of the transition to an energy future
with  greater renewable energy component in cities around the world� Peak
electricity demand is sky rocketing as India continues to experience rapid
urbanisation and migration to metropolitan cities, making it increasingly
difficult for local electricity utilities to service it� In this context, MNRE
launched  programme for the ‘Development of Solar Cities’ in February 2008� The
recently revised programme aims, at the very least, at  10% reduction in
projected demand for conventional energy after five years: this can be achieved
through combining energy efficiency measures and increased renewable energy
supplies� All types of renewable energy – such as solar, wind, biomass, small
hydropower, and waste to energy – may be installed along with possible energy
efficiency measures, depending on  city’ need and resource availability� Sixty
cities and towns are eventually to be enlisted in the ‘Solar Cities’ programme –
with  minimum of one city, and  maximum of seven, per state� Specifications for
being chosen as  solar city include population size, which must be between 500
000 and  000 000 people� The programme consolidates existing local efforts to
promote renewable energy – such as solar water heating systems, rooftop PV
systems, and waste to energy systems – and proposes holistic energy management�
Cities prepare  holistic master plan, which includes an energy consumption
baseline, future demand forecasting and strategies per sector, and an action
plan for implementing renewable energy projects on identified sites to reduce
their fossil fuel consumption� (MNRE, 2015b)� Finance, amounting to
approximately USD 100 000 per city, is provided under the programme for
developing the plan, identifying project sites and potential, and monitoring and
promoting the deployment of renewable energy projects� By July 2014, 31 cities
had been enlisted and had started the development of  master plan, while another
17 had got ‘in principle’ approval from the MNRE�    RENEWABLE ENERGY POTENTIAL
AND COSTS Table  provides an overview of MNRE and other organisations’ estimates
of the technical potential for power generation in India� The country has an
estimated renewable energy potential of about 900 GW from commercially
exploitable sources ( 000 GW when large hydropower is included)� It is endowed
with very good solar energy potential� Most areas receive on average between -
kWh/m2/day of solar irradiance� Assuming % of the country’ wasteland is
available for it there is  solar power potential of 750 GW� MNRE estimates the
annual potential for biomass- based electricity at 18 GW, generated by 120–150
million tonnes of agricultural and forestry residues� There is also about  GW of
possible power capacity from bagasse-based cogeneration in sugar mills� Sugar
mills represent the largest share of industrial combined heat and power (CHP)
potential in the country, equivalent to 14 GW� There is also  GW of additional
potential from energy crops, taking current total biomass power generation
capacity potential to 28 GW (MNRE, 2012; 2015c)� The potential for wind is more
differentiated� The National Wind Resource Assessment programme monitored 794
sites with heights ranging from 20- 120 meters� At  hub height of 80 metres,
there is at least 102� GW of potential at sites with  wind power density greater
than 200 /m2 (MNRE, 2012)� Other studies show considerable more potential,
ranging from 300 GW to as much as 1000 GW (NIWE, ��)� India has  vast  600 km
coastline and preliminary studies have indicated potential for deploying
offshore wind power projects in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)� The potential
of hydropower – small and large – is estimated by MNRE to be 20 GW (based on
474 assessed sites) and 100 GW, respectively� The IEA assesses total hydropower
potential at around 150 GW (IEA, 2011)� According to an IREDA atlas of potential
land for renewable energy assessment, there is 15 GW of potential for small
hydropower for schemes up to 25 MW� The same assessment adds that the potential
is actually much larger, as different states are offering sites for small
hydropower for self-identification by prospective bidders� Table : Renewable

early 2017 some PV auction have broken the USD �05/kWh mark, but there was still

still being built� IRENA estimates that supply costs range from USD -12/GJ� The
lower end of the range refers to agricultural residues (harvesting and
processing), as well as to biogas, the higher end to forest products and
residues, including fuelwood� Wind, hydropower, biomass power and solar PV all
compete with fossil fuel power generation, with increasingly renewable energy
being the least-cost generation option India has some of the world’ most
competitive levelised costs of electricity (LCOE), even for wind, where the
quality of the local resource is lower than in other regions� Financing costs,
however, are somewhat higher than in neighbouring countries like China, and this
has an impact on the LCOE� Figure 17 gives an overview of ranges and weighted
averages for renewable power technologies commissioned or proposed between 2013

with weighted average costs of between USD �04/kWh and USD �05/kWh for small-

costs of around USD �08/kWh, with  range between USD �045/kWh and USD �11/kWh,

points ● Total renewable energy demand in end-use sectors (excluding renewable
electricity) will see an increase from about � EJ/yr to � EJ/yr� In the building
sector, which includes residential, commercial and government sub-sectors,
developments in the traditional use of biomass are modest, with demand
increasing from � EJ/ yr in 2010 to � EJ/yr� In the industrial sector, the only
renewable energy source is solid biomass use for process heat generation: this
will increase by 50% from  200 PJ/yr in 2010 to  800 PJ/yr by 2030� Fossil fuels
still dominate, and coal use doubles� The transport sector sees more than
doubling in demand, from  400 PJ/yr to almost  000 PJ/yr by 2030, almost all the
increase is met by oil products� ● India’ TFEC is projected to increase from 17�
EJ in 2010 to 42� EJ in 2030 in the Reference Case� Energy use trends, largely
based on Planning Commission and CEEW estimates, show that its future energy
demand will continue to be mainly reliant on fossil fuels� ● Total power
generation is expected to increase by � times from 945 TWh/yr in 2010 to over
450 TWh/yr by 2030� Some  000 TWh of the expected increase will be met by growth
in coal power generation� Total gross power generation capacity will reach an
estimated 670 GW by 2030� Of this total, 40% – 262 GW installed capacity – will
be related to renewable power generation� ● The results of the Reference Case
show that fossil fuel growth largely dominates the period up to 2030� While the
growth of renewable power generation accelerates, the use of coal in industry,
of natural gas in buildings, and of oil in transport results in  decrease in
renewables’ overall share, particularly in the buildings and industry sectors� ●
Coal power capacity will reach 385 GW, an increase of around 290 GW over 2010
levels� Total coal demand for power generation will increase by  factor of �,
from around  EJ to just under 28 EJ in the Reference Case� ● The increased
renewable power capacity in the Reference Case is significant compared to
historic trends, but still low compared to the growth in coal power capacity�
Installed hydropower capacity will grow by around 25 GW to 48 GW, and biomass
and biogas capacity from around  GW to 11 GW in total� Wind power capacity will
experience the greatest increase to reach 145 GW by 2030, compared to 14 GW in
2010� Solar PV will also see strong growth� The REmap analysis of India begins
with an assessment of the uptake of renewable energy technology options between
2010 and 2030, based on current policies� Planning Commission (GOI, 2014b) and
CEEW (2015d) estimates are used to  large extent to develop the Reference Case
for this analysis, though IRENA estimates are employed in assessing biomass and
LPG use in the building sector and some bioenergy technology breakdowns in the
power sector, including off-grid power applications� ● In total, the renewable
energy share in TFEC will decrease from 40% to 23%, when traditional uses of
biomass are included, and from 17% to 12% in terms of the modern renewable
energy, which excludes such traditional uses in the building sector� India’
energy use has been growing rapidly and projections show that its TFEC is
projected to increase from 17� EJ in 2010 to 42� EJ in 2030� The country needs
to choose how this growth will be met� This chapter overviews the Reference Case

trends in India between 2010 and 2030, which mainly rely on fossil fuels�
generation from solar PV will increase rapidly from under  TWh/yr to 83 TWh/yr
by 2030, while bioenergy power (including biogas) grows from 10 TWh/yr to around
35 TWh/yr� Between 2010 and 2030, the largest increase is in natural gas, which
grows 20 fold, fuelled by surging LPG imports� Oil demand doubles due to large
increases in demand from transport and buildings� Coal use also doubles in end-
use sectors, while biomass use grows slightly, by around 10%� The increases in
natural gas and oil are driven by an increase in economic activity and
accelerated urbanisation, which takes the number of people living in cities and
towns to 600 million by 2030� Urban populations consume more natural gas and
oil, and – importantly in India’ case – significantly more electricity� Though
growth in end-use fuel consumption is significant, it is overshadowed by the
very rapid increase in the consumption of electricity� The total gross capacity
of the power system will almost quadruple from 174 GW in 2010 to an estimated
670 GW by 2030� Coal power capacity will reach 385 GW in the Reference Case, an
increase of around 290 GW over 2010 levels (Figure 20)� Total coal demand for
power generation will increase by  factor of � times over, from around  EJ to
just under 28 EJ� As discussed in Chapter , heavy reliance on coal will require
significant imports from world markets as domestic supply is limited and the
quality of Indian coal is low (with  low heat rate)� Power generation capacity
from oil and nuclear will experience very slight growth, and natural gas
capacity will remain flat� Total power generation is expected to increase �
times over in the Reference Case from 945 TWh/yr in 2010 to over  450 TWh/yr by
2030� Some  000 TWh/yr of this extra  500 TWh/yr will be met by increases in
coal power generation� Renewable power generation, meanwhile, is projected to
increase from about 137 TWh/yr to 595 TWh/yr (Figure 19)� Wind energy will form
the largest component of this with around 345 TWh/yr in 2030, followed by
hydropower with 131 TWh/yr� Power Renewable power capacity in the Reference Case
is significant compared to historic trends, but still low when contrasted with
the growth in coal-fired power� Installed hydropower capacity will grow by
around 25 GW to 48 GW, and biomass and biogas capacity will grow from around  GW
to 11 GW in total� Wind power capacity undergoes the greatest growth in absolute
terms to reach 145 GW by 2030 from 14 GW in 2010�   Figure 20: Reference Case

even more proportionately, from under  GW to 56 GW12 (of which 15 GW is
distributed rooftop PV)�  700 PJ/yr (Figure 21)� In the building sector, which
includes residential, commercial and public sub-sectors, the traditional use of
biomass only increases from  100 PJ/yr in 2010 to  300 PJ/yr,  very modest
increase compared to the doubling of the sector’ final energy demand� The
doubling of the sector’ demand is largely driven by significant growth in LPG
and natural gas consumption� The increase demand for modern forms of bioenergy
for cooking sees limited growth� Modern forms of solid biomass use increase by
only 10% in the building sector, from  400 PJ/yr to  500 PJ/yr, but its use of
biogas, though low, grows more than six-fold from 10 PJ/yr to 65 PJ/yr� The only
other sizable renewable source is solar thermal, which increases 12-fold to 72
PJ/yr by 2030, but from  very low  PJ/yr starting point� In the Reference Case
demand for coal for both heating and power generation grows significantly� To
meet this demand, measures will be needed to accommodate such  high coal demand�
Current exploration and mining of coal needs upgrading; this, along with
increasing demand, will be  major challenge if no action is taken�
Infrastructure for coal imports will be required on India’ western and southern
coasts� Coal washing will need to become the norm requiring large quantities of
water, and the fuels environmental externalities will need to be internalised
(IEA, 2011)� These investments could lock-in infrastructure that assure the
country consumes large quantities of coal for decades to come� In the industrial
sector, the only sizable source of renewable energy is solid biomass use for
heat generation, which will increase by 50% from around  200 PJ/yr in 2010 to
800 PJ/yr by 2030� Fossil fuels still dominate: coal use doubles from  200 PJ/yr
to  400 PJ/yr by 2030, as does oil consumption, from  600 PJ/yr to  200 PJ/yr�
The largest increase – from 280 PJ/yr to just under  000 PJ/yr – is in natural
gas� Total renewable energy demand in end-use sectors (excluding renewable
electricity) will increase in the Reference Case from about  600 PJ/yr to 12
Solar PV growth in the Reference Case does not take into account the recently-
announced goal of achieving 100 GW by 2022, this goal is considered accelerated
renewable uptake and is incorporated into the REmap Options   Figure 21:

Geothermal 2010 Reference Case 2030 Source: IRENA analysis Energy use in the
transport sector more than doubles from  400 PJ/yr to almost  000 PJ/yr by 2030�
Petrol and diesel consumption increases from  100 PJ/yr to  600 PJ/yr, with
small additional supply of liquid biofuel, largely based on biodiesel,
increasing from  PJ/ yr to 109 PJ/yr: that may be more than  thirteen-fold
increase, but it still only provides under % of the sector’ energy needs� Table
gives an overview of the Reference Case’ change in the share of renewables
(including both modern and traditional uses of bioenergy) in India’ TFEC between
2010 and 2030� The share of modern renewable energy in the industry and
buildings sectors actually falls, due to large increases in their consumption of
coal (in industry) and natural gas (in buildings)� In the end-use sectors only
bioenergy sees growth among renewable sources in the Reference Case; significant
growth is, however, seen in fossil fuel demand Renewables’ share in the power
sector increases, however, from 14% to 18% in the same period – despite the high
growth in coal power generation – as  result of the growth in solar PV and wind
and, to  lesser Table : Renewable energy share in the Reference Case of India,

estimates   extent, hydropower� The transport sector sees modest growth in
renewable energy due to  small increase in biofuel� social and environmental
impacts and so need to be substituted with modern forms of renewables� The
results of the Reference Case show that fossil fuel growth largely dominates the
period up to 2030� While the growth of renewable power generation accelerates,
the use of coal in industry, natural gas in the building sector, and oil in the
transport sector results in  decrease in the overall share of renewables
particularly in buildings and industry� While much attention should be paid to
the significant increases in electricity demand and the opportunities to
increase renewable energy deployment in the power sector, there is also  need to
look at increasing the growth of renewables in the end-use sectors� It is clear
from this Reference Case that India is at the start of  period of  very high
increase in energy demand, and government plans currently envisage the vast
majority of it as being met by fossil fuels, despite little potential to supply
them from domestic sources� Greater attention should be paid to meeting this
demand with domestically produced renewable energy� The following chapters will
address this challenge, and show how India can achieve significantly higher
growth in renewable energy� Even though the share of electricity in India’ TFEC
is up from 12% to 25%, and the share of renewable power slightly increases, this
is overshadowed by the growth in end-use fuels� As  result, the renewable energy
share in TFEC will decrease from 40% to 23% in the Reference Case, when
traditional uses of biomass are included, and from 17% to 12% if viewed in terms
of modern renewable energy (which excludes traditional uses of biomass in the
building sector)� The share of renewable energy in India’ TFEC was around 39% in
2012 – split into 10% modern and 29% traditional forms – according to the Global
Tracking Framework (GTF; World Bank, 2015)� The IRENA analysis for the REmap
base year of 2010 shows  similar share for total renewable energy (40%) but
higher one, of around 17% for modern renewables than in the GTF� Yet modern
renewables are still less than half of all renewable energy consumed, with
large share still coming from traditional uses of biomass� These traditional
uses are not sustainable and have negative    THE REMAP OPTIONS TO 2030 Key
points ● Options have been identified that could raise India’ renewable energy
use to approximately � EJ by 2030, equivalent to  25% share of TFEC� They
include full substitution of traditional uses of biomass by modern renewables� –
have been estimated for industry� With these additions in REmap, solar thermal
would account for about �% of India’ total industrial energy demand (excluding
power)� In the building sector an additional 125 million m2 are considered as
REmap Options� Most of this is for water heating, with  smaller share related to
solar cooling substituting for air conditioning systems� The total installed
solar water heating capacity in India’ building sector would increase to 154
million m2, delivering 370 PJ/yr, % of its total energy demand� ● Forty-two
percent of the total renewable energy use in REmap is related to renewable power
options� Various forms of biomass (such as for power, heat, and motor fuel) and
solar (PV, CSP, solar thermal heating/cooling) would together account for 80% of
total renewable energy use in 2030� ● REmap estimates  trend towards more
electricity use in the transport sector through the increased use of electric
vehicles and structural changes� An additional 100 TWh/yr electricity use is
estimated for electric vehicles, with 20 million four-wheel cars and as many as
350 million two to three wheelers on the road in 2030� ● Of the REmap Options
identified in the power sector, 40% are related to solar PV, 20% to wind, 16% to
hydro and 11% to biomass� The remaining is related to geothermal, solar CSP and
rural electrification� ● Total wind capacity would increase 14 times over from
its 2010 level� The increase in solar PV capacity is even higher and would reach
an installed capacity of 200 GW by 2030 plus additional off-grid solar PV, more
than double India’ 2022 target of 100 GW� Renewable power’ share of total
capacity would increase to 39% in the Reference Case, and 60% in REmap� India’
INDC pledged to reach  share of 40% by 2030� ● In REmap modern renewable energy’
share of India’ TFEC increases to 25% in 2030, more than double the Reference
Case level of 12%� Renewable energy’ share in power generation increases to 35%
in REmap, from 14% in 2010, compared to 18% in the Reference Case� ● The energy
intensity of India’ economy was USD � per MJ in 2010 and will decrease in the
Reference Case by 17% to USD � per MJ in 2030� In REmap, this is reduced further
to USD � per MJ,  decrease of 26% over 2010 levels� ● Primary biomass use would
increase 20% over 2010 levels� While traditional use of bioenergy would be fully
substituted by 2030, total primary biomass demand for its modern uses would more
than double by then� Additional potential for biomass use is concentrated in the
industrial, power generation and transport sectors� ● Investment needs to rise
considerably� The REmap options would require USD 26 billion in additional
investment per year in renewable capacity, which – when added to the Reference
Case investment need of USD 16 billion – would result in 42 billion of total
investment needs for renewable technologies per year between now and 2030� ●
Solar thermal heat will play an important role� 20 million m2 of low-temperature
solar water heater capacity – and 12 million m2 of medium- temperature
concentrating solar collectors   ● Coal demand would decrease by 17% over the
Reference Case, to around 30 EJ/yr, and oil demand by 23% to  EJ/yr� ● The
Reference Case for the period between 2010 and 2030 was created� The results of
this projection are explained in Section , ● The total package of REmap Options
identified would result in an incremental cost of substitution of USD � per GJ
for consumers and result in additional costs of USD �/GJ for society, making
total of USD 17 billion per year in additional costs� These exclude savings from
the benefits of renewable energy from improved human health and reduced CO2
emissions� ● Commodities and fuel prices reflecting the national situation were
prepared; ● Technology cost and performance criteria (�� capacity factors) were
also prepared to reflect the national situation and ● Additional renewable
energy options for all end- use sectors and the power sector were analysed,
based on various studies and assessments� ● These USD 17 billion total system
costs would be outweighed by estimated savings from the effects of reducing air
pollution, which amount to USD /yr, and from  reduction of 750 Mt of CO2
emissions per year by 2030, saving USD /yr� Most of the savings related to air
pollution are associated with the effects of traditional uses of biomass in the
residential sector� The sources of the REmap Options for India originate from
range of research that includes: ● For the power sector: The Planning Commission
(GOI, 2014b) and Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) estimates of the CEEW
(2015d) were used, as well as internal assessments prepared by IRENA with input
from MNRE� The Reference Case is broadly based on the Baseline Inclusive Growth
Scenario, while the REmap Options are largely based on the Low Carbon Inclusive
Growth scenario; ● The REmap Options would also have positive macroeconomic
benefits for India across the board, resulting in higher GDP and significant net
employment effects� The Reference Case (�� business as usual) analysis for India
uses an internally developed REmap tool� The data, assumptions and approach used
were summarised in Chapter  while the results of the Reference Case are detailed
in Chapter � Under the Reference Case, India is expected to experience  very
significant growth in energy demand, in the order of around  two and  half times
increase� Importantly most of this growth is to be met by fossil fuels, and the
overall share of renewables actually decreases, despite  slight increase in the
use of renewable power� So it is important to see where additional renewable
potential is available, and IRENA uses the REmap tool to input this in the form
of additional renewable energy options in the end-use sectors of industry,
buildings, and transport, as well as for power and district heat generation� The
process for identifying the REmap Options was as follows: ● For the heating
(buildings and industry) sector: Solar Water Heaters in India (GOI, 2010) and
recent IRENA renewable energy in industry roadmap (IRENA, 2014b) with its
accompanying data were used; and ● For the transport sector:  variety of sources
were used, including CEEW (2015d), IRENA analysis, the Planning Commission (GOI,
2014b), Vision 2020 –  Blueprint for Railway Electrification Programme (GOI,
2011), and the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020 (GOI, 2012)� In
addition, expert opinions from MNRE, IRENA and external authorities were
incorporated into the analysis to arrive at renewable potential� These were
primarily the source of some biomass, off-grid and renewable power technology
assessments�   Figure 22: Power capacity by renewable energy technology 250 )

2010 Reference Case 2030 REmap 2030 Note: Figure only includes on-grid power
capacity Source: IRENA analysis Solar � Renewable energy technologies in the
power sector REmap Options can potentially take the installed capacity of on-
grid solar PV to 200 GW and higher if including additional off-grid systems�
This is over four times higher than is envisioned in the Reference Case, which
assumes achieving 20 GW by 2022, and an installation rate of just over  GW/yr
between then and 2030 to have 48 GW by that time� REmap Options include the
recently proposed target of 100 GW by 2022 (as this constitutes an accelerated
approach for renewables this is included in the REmap case)� Achieving the REmap
total of 200 GW would require an annual installation rate of  GW/yr from the
2014 level until 2022 and 15 GW/yr between then and 2030� Utility-scale solar
accounts for 160 GW, and distributed generation – including grid-connected
rooftop, for the remainder� An additional 20 GW of solar home systems and solar
for telecom towers would also be in operation� The Reference Case showed modest
developments in the power generation sector with  slight increase in the
renewable share from 14% to 18%� There is significant growth in renewable power
generation capacity (particularly wind, but also solar), but total demand for
power in India grows equally fast, resulting in only relatively small increases
in the sector’ total renewable energy share between 2010 and 2030� The share of
renewable power capacity reaches 39% of capacity in the Reference Case, just shy
of the 40% INDC target� In fact, the fivefold increase in power demand creates
significant opportunity to realise India’ large potential for renewables, and
this needs to be considered� Figure 22 shows the change in renewable power
generation capacities between 2010 and 2030, if the realisable potential of all
renewable energy technologies waste is deployed beyond the Reference Case� In
REmap the renewable share of capacity increases considerably, to 60%� The rest
of this section explains this potential, technology by technology� Solar PV has
capacity factor ranging from 16% to 19% and is estimated to produce around 350
TWh/yr of power, making up around 10% of India’ power supply� So the impact of
this addition on the grid will be limited (see Chapter  for  more detailed grid
discussion)�   Wind This share is an increase from nearly zero at present, and
represents significantly higher growth even greater than the very big increase
expected in total demand for electricity� The capacity of onshore wind in 2030
increases from 145 GW in the Reference Case to 185 GW in REmap� The Reference
Case assumes reaching  60 GW target by 2022, and continued growth until 2030
with 145 GW installed wind power, resulting in just under  GW of capacity
additions per year on average between 2015 and 2030� Recent wind capacity
installations have averaged  GW per year, but rates have reached  GW/yr in
several recent years, showing that more is possible� Realising the potential
identified in REmap would require  significant increase over recent trends�
REmap also assumes  limited growth in offshore wind, from just under � GW in the
Reference Case to  GW� Total wind power generation would amount to 470 TWh, or
just above 13% of total electricity supply� Together wind with solar PV would
represent approximately 21% of the total power generation in India� Rooftops in
densely populated cities are an important element in the availability of space
for solar PV and thermal systems� By 2030 around 40% of buildings would have
either  solar thermal or solar PV system on their roofs� The estimate is based
on the availability of rooftops in New Delhi: at present they amount to around
31 km2, which could take an estimated � GW of solar PV modules (Greenpeace,
2013)� As Delhi makes up around % of India’ total population, the total Indian
rooftop potential may be around 250 GW� If it is assumed that there is around 50
GW of distributed rooftop solar PV (including solar home systems), around 20% of
India’ available rooftop area would have  solar PV system in 2030� With around
150 million m2 of solar thermal residential and commercial systems, an estimated
20% of buildings would have them� Bioenergy Besides this very significant growth
in solar PV, REmap assumes an addition of 10 GW of solar CSP� The Reference Case
assumes that there will be none of it� So, though  growth to 10 GW may seem
modest compared to the increase in PV, it still implies building  large CSP
plants within the next 15 years� The CSP plants included in REmap for 2030 have
capacity factors up to 30% but no storage: though many CSP plants which include
storage are being planned around the world, they result in higher costs�
Besides, the fact that the increasing electricity demand in India is partly
being driven by demand for cooling means the mid-day and afternoon peak load
requirements fit well with CSP production, thereby reducing the incentive to
build storage into them– at least before 2030� CSP plants commissioned in
Rajasthan achieved capacity factors ranging between 19% and 26% in 2014� Gujarat
and Maharashtra in the west of India, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and
Uttarakhand in the north, and Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in the
south – as well as Rajasthan – are favourable locations with high direct solar
radiation� The analysis assumes that the CSP plants are built in regions that
ensure higher capacity factors than are presently achieved� Bioenergy used for
electricity is differentiated in detail� In broad terms, the additions taking
place in REmap are  mix of technologies that include  GW of biomass co-firing in
coal power plants,  GW of solid biomass residue-fired CHP biomass plants in
industry,  GW of gasifiers used in urban and rural applications,  GW of power-
alone biomass fired power plants,  GW of waste-to-power systems, and � of GW
off-grid biogas� REmap biomass use estimates are based on an overview of the
assessments of potential prepared by the MNRE and other sources� Assumptions for
each technology are discussed below� ● REmap assumes that around  GW additional
power capacity from combustion of solid biomass in power-alone and co-firing –
mostly in plants that at present burn coal – is added to this total� So just
over % of the total coal power capacity of 310 GW still present in REmap, would
be used to co-combust biomass for power production� ● For power-alone solid
biomass combustion systems, MNRE estimates  total potential of about 23 GW,
split between 18 GW from agricultural/forestry residues and  GW from energy
crops� Yet IRENA’ internal assessment of biomass supplies includes no dedicated
energy crops, so it is assumed that none of the  GW   capacity would be deployed
by 2030� Based on today’ residue generation factors, REmap assumes reaching 10
GW of the 18 GW potential (compared to  GW in 2010)� in 2030� Another  GW is
assumed for non- bagasse-fired capacity which results in  2030 total of � GW�
Hydropower ● For waste-to-power systems, there is an estimate of about  GW
potential� This is 3GW higher than the  GW in the Reference Case since waste
generation potential will increase along with growth in population and the
economy� its India has large limited potential to expand hydropower capacity� In
2015 around 42 GW total hydropower capacity was in operation, with around 10% of
it considered medium and small hydropower� The Reference Case envisions
increasing the total installed capacity by 11 GW, mostly in large hydropower�
Based on the Planning Commission’ Low Carbon, Inclusive Growth (LCIG) scenario,
capacity will increase to around 77 GW in REmap, with  significant acceleration
of small hydropower systems� Total hydropower generation will reach 246 TWh/yr,
the third biggest renewable source after wind and solar PV� However, realising
such  large increase in hydropower capacity would present difficulties�
According to GlobalData (2016), 17 GW of hydropower capacity is under
construction with an additional  GW in the financing phase� REmap would require
this to almost double, with an additional 14 GW constructed� An estimated 50 GW
is undergoing consideration and review for permitting in India� Considering the
long permitting, planning and construction periods of many hydropower plants,
many of these will not be built by 2030, but,  large number of projects are
clearly being considered� ● For co-generation in industry, in 2010, the total
installed cogeneration capacity in India’ sugar mills was about � GW (electric-
capacity), generating about  TWh/yr, based on  35% capacity factor (based on
mills in Uttar Pradesh, and considering both on-season and off-season)� This is
equivalent to total generation of 85 kWh per tonne of bagasse� ● India produces
approximately 80 Mt wet bagasse with  lower heating value of approximately -
MJ/kg) each year, about 70 Mt of which is used for captive power generation�13
According to Vision 2030 for the sugar industry, total sugar cane production
will grow to 520 Mt/yr� by 2030 and would generate  total volume of 120 Mt wet
bagasse per year� Based on today’ level of wet bagasse use for power
cogeneration (70 Mt out of 80 Mt), this provides the potential to install � GW
in power capacity (at slightly improved efficiency levels and using 100 Mt/yr
wet bagasse) in the Reference Case� The Reference Case assumes an additional  GW
biomass-fired (non-bagasse) CHP capacity for distilleries, dairies and rice
mills, which today have  combined CHP potential of  GW (Singh, Singh and Mahla,
2013), rising to about  GW by 2030 since total Indian industrial energy use will
by then have doubled since 2010� Renewable off-grid and electrification In 2030,
an estimated  485 million people will live in India, 59% them in rural areas�
This compares to 71% in 2005 when India’ total population was  131 million� At
that time 55% of the rural population had access to electricity, but
electrification had increased to around 75% of the total population by 2014� The
Reference Case gives  gap to be closed of 240 million people by 2030 (assuming
95% rate of electrification), whereas REmap – assuming 98% electrification –
puts it  280 million� ● In Remap, the efficiency of bagasse-fired CHP plants is
twice today’ levels, but less bagasse is available because some of it is used in
producing advanced biofuels� This results in � GW bagasse-based power generation
capacity Electrification is possible either by grid-connection or off-grid
systems� In the Reference Case, it is assumed that up to one-third of total
rural electrification needs (related to household demand) can be met by off-
grid/mini-grid systems� Assuming  total demand of 100 kWh of electricity in
households of  people, the total needs of rural areas at present without access
to power is equivalent to  TWh/yr, of which � TWh/ 13 Information about total
heat production from cogeneration plants is limited� One source states that it
is around 110 PJ per year (power-to-heat ratio of �) but that, in actuality, it
is likely to be lower (ISMA, ��)� So an order of 150 compared to total power
generation (so  power-to-heat ratio of about �15) is assumed�   yr would be
supplied by renewable energy off-grid systems� It is assumed that half of this
can be supplied by solar home systems ( GW, with  capacity factor of  300
hours/yr), 40% by biomass systems that include gasifiers and biomethanisation (�
GW, both with  capacity factor of  100 hours/yr), and the remaining 10% by wind
(�13 GW, capacity factor of  000 hours/ yr)� With such developments,  total of �
GW off-grid capacity would be installed in India by 2030, compared to today’
level of about 120 MW� Biomass gasifiers also play  role in urban areas (� GW),
particularly in industrial systems� REmap biomass fuel demand for CHP15 heat
increases by 320 PJ/yr� Estimates of biogas and biomass gasification are based
on IRENA’ manufacturing industry report (IRENA, 2014b) to increase from 25 PJ/yr
in the Reference Case to 250 PJ/yr in REmap� No additional solid biomass use is
estimated beyond the Reference Case for heat- only process systems in India’
manufacturing industry� Total traditional and modern uses of biomass in the
building sector increase only slightly by 10%, while the sector’ total demand
for fuel doubles between 2010 and 2030�  considerable share of the total
traditional uses of biomass is substituted with LPG/kerosene and natural gas in
the Reference Case� Remap assumes full substitution of traditional uses of
biomass through  mix of modern biomass technologies and solar cookers� Gasifiers
and biogas plants, already used in large amounts, would account for 45% of total
modern biomass needs (at about 30% conversion efficiency), while another half
would come from solid biomass use in modern cookstoves (at 25% conversion
efficiency)� In total, REmap assumes that around  500 PJ/yr of modern biomass
and biogas would be required to meet the cooking needs provided by the  200
PJ/yr of traditional biomass still used in the Reference Case� This shift to
modern forms of biomass cooking would result in   700 PJ/yr reduction of biomass
use the building sector� For REmap, virtually full power access is assumed,
raising total power needs to � TWh/yr� It is assumed that up to two-thirds of
this total demand would be met by off-grid/mini-grid systems with biomass
gasifier and biomethanisation accounting for 40% of them (� GW installed
capacity), solar home systems 35% (� GW in total) and wind 25% (� GW)� Solar
systems can also play  role in the growing number of telecom towers in India�
There are now about 740 000 of them, 70% in areas with less than 16 hours’ grid
supply  day� Many are entirely powered by diesel generators� By 2020, the number
of towers is expected to increase by at least  third to just under one million�
Already � billion litres of diesel is consumed annually to ensure continuous
power supplies: by 2030 this could reach about  billion litres per year,
generating about 30 TWh of electricity� About 70% of the towers’ total power
needs in 2030 could be met with 13 GW of off-grid solar systems, with capacity
factor of about  750 hours/yr�  total of � billion litres of ethanol (30%
advanced, 70% conventional) and  billion litres of biodiesel was assumed for the
transport sector in REmap� The Reference case also sees  strong, if smaller,
growth of approximately  billion litres of ethanol and around  billion litres of
biodiesel� In total, transport sector liquid biofuel demand reaches 20� billion
litres (or 470 PJ) representing 13% of the sector’ total energy demand in REmap�
� Renewable energy technologies in the end-use sectors Bioenergy for heating and
transport fuel With all these additions in various biomass technologies, India’
total primary biomass demand reaches � EJ (see Figure 23) in REmap compared to
approximately � EJ in 2010, but is higher at � EJ in the Reference Case� The
decrease from the Reference Case total is due to replacing traditional uses of
biomass with REmap Options include various biomass technology options for
heating, cooking and transport as well as solar thermal and electricity-based
alternatives to thermal systems� The various forms of bioenergy make up the
largest type of fuel used in end-use sectors�14 In 15 This estimate of biomass
use for industrial process heating is based on energy allocation of total fuel
input to CHPs and their power and heat output� 14 The biomass used for
industrial CHP is estimated based on the total CHP generation explained in the
bioenergy power section�   Figure 23: Primary biomass demand by sector with
REmap Options, 2030 Transport,  EJ Power,  EJ Power 16% Transport; 10% Total:
EJ/yr Industry and Buildings, 74% Buildings,  EJ Industry,  EJ Source: IRENA
analysis modern, more efficient alternatives� Demand for heating in buildings
and industry would account for three- quarters of the total, with the remaining
quarter divided between transport fuels and power generation� Total biomass
demand in REmap would be 94% of the total � EJ supply potential of biomass in
India in 2030 (the total is based on IRENA’ bioenergy supply assessment (IRENA,
2014c)) conditioning systems� Their capacity factors, at between 10% and 12%,
are somewhat lower than those of industrial systems� Added to installed capacity
of 29 million m2 solar thermal capacity in the Reference Case, this would
increase the total installed solar water heating capacity in India’ building
sector to 154 million m2, or % of its total energy demand� Electrification in
the transport sector in REmap assumes an additional Solar thermal 30 million m2
of low-temperature solar water heater capacity for process heat in industry,
along with an additional 12 million m2 of medium-temperature concentrating solar
collectors� The concentrating systems operate with capacity factors around 20%:
for solar water heaters it is 13%� Solar thermal heating would therefore grow
considerably from just � million m2 in the Reference Case� With REmap’
additions, solar thermal would account for about �% of manufacturing industry’
total energy demand (excluding power) in India� REmap shows  trend towards more
use of electricity in transport, through increasing use of electric vehicles, as
well as structural changes or so-called modal shift� An additional 100 TWh/yr is
estimated for electric vehicles – made up of four-wheel passenger cars (40% of
the total additional demand), public vehicles (30%) and two-wheelers (30%)� This
would increase the total electricity demand of the transport sector by 150% in
2030, compared to the Reference Case� Modal shifts to city trams from passenger
road vehicles, and to high speed trains from aviation contribute further to the
electrification of the transport sector and result in 60 TWh/yr extra
electricity demand� The full 160 TWh/yr in additional demand is assumed to be
supplied by new renewable power generation capacity, shared equally by new
hydropower and solar PV� Electric vehicle Remap Options also estimate much
higher capacity additions -125 million m2 – on top of the Reference Case for the
buildings and services sector (including hotels)� The majority of this is for
water heating with  smaller share related to solar cooling substituting for air

penetration of battery electric two- to-three-wheelers, 20% of four-wheel
battery electric vehicles (BEV) and 18% of public electric buses� � Renewable
energy capacity deployment and shares Figure 24 shows the increases in renewable
energy in TFEC for grouped renewable energy resources between 2010 and 2030,
showing the growth occurring in both the Reference Case and REmap Options, and
sheds light on the relative importance of each resource� Biomass use does not
increase in REmap, as  result of substitution for its traditional uses, but it
still remains the most important form of renewables in final energy terms� Solar
energy experiences the largest percentage growth, because of significant growth
in solar PV, as well as solar thermal systems in industry and buildings� Wind
energy is the third largest source, but can only be used to produce power� It
already experiences considerable growth in the Reference Case, so additions from
the REmap Options are more limited� Hydropower is the fourth largest
contributor, followed by minor additions of geothermal power� The Reference Case
estimates  million electric vehicles to be in operation, 80% of them electric
two-to-three- wheelers� In REmap this number increases greatly to 350 million,
of which over 90% are assumed to be electric two-to-three-wheelers, with around
20 million passenger four-wheelers and buses� Geothermal energy India’
geothermal potential is very limited� The Reference Case envisages no addition
of geothermal power, and  small share of geothermal heat, used largely in the
building sector� The REmap Options assume  modest increase in geothermal power,
based on assessments from CEEW’ (2015d) GCAM� In total  capacity of around  GW,
producing 16 TWh of electricity, could be in operation by 2030� There is also an
assumption of  small amount of additional geothermal heat in industry based on
an IRENA assessment for renewable energy in manufacturing (2014b)� Figure 25
shows the breakdown of renewable energy use by consuming sector in 2010 and
under REmap� Biomass changes significantly, as its traditional use in the
building sector is replaced with modern alternatives� Growth in biomass use is
largely in the form of biofuels and residue combustion for CHP in industry�

analysis The other changes include  significant increase in solar thermal
heating and solar PV power generation in both the building and industrial
sectors� Solar PV and wind become the largest renewable sources of electricity,
followed by hydropower� They achieve  significant share in India’ final
renewable energy use from nearly zero today� Biomass, but in modern forms,
continues to dominate India’ � EJ of total renewable energy use in REmap in
final energy terms, accounting for two-thirds of it� is explained by the equally
fast-growing TFEC of the sector as India becomes  more industrialised country�
The share of renewable energy in transport shows  significant increase from
negligible in 2010 and only % in the Reference Case� In REmap 13% of transport
fuel comes from biofuel, and the share climbs to 16% when renewable electricity
is included� The building sector’ modern renewable energy share almost doubles
to 39% in REmap from 21% in 2010, driven by the modern use of biomass and solar
thermal� Of the � EJ of renewable energy consumed in REmap, approximately  third
is electricity, up from % in 2010� About another third is fuel consumed in the
building sector, largely for cooking – mostly modern forms of biomass but also
some solar thermal heat� Most of the remaining third is biomass used in the
industry sector for heating, with  small contribution from solar thermal and
geothermal heat� Heating continues to be the largest market in REmap with  total
59% share and the use of biofuel in the transport sector makes up around % of
renewable energy use compared to less than % in 2010� Transport fuels reach  %
share compared to less than % in 2010� Table  overviews development in physical
terms between 2010 and 2030, showing how renewable capacity would increase from
just above 50 GW in 2010 to over 520 GW in REmap, with  similar increase in
power generation from renewables� The table also shows how direct uses of
renewable energy – �� energy sourced from renewables for heating, cooling and
transport fuels – significantly increase�  more detailed table showing  higher
resolution of technology deployment, including rural and off-grid systems, is
available in Annex , including notes that describe some of the assumptions used
to arrive at the REmap Options� With all these developments, the share of modern
renewable energy shares in India’ TFEC increases to 25% in REmap, more than
double the 2030 Reference Case level of 12%� Renewable energy’ share in power
generation increases to 35% in REmap, from 14% in 2010, compared to 18% in the
Reference Case� Despite an increasing amount of biomass and solar thermal being
used in industry, the sector’ renewable energy share remains at around 2010

potential curve, and ranks them for cost- effectiveness� The cost-supply curve
is an approximate representation of the realistic potential of renewable energy
technologies – the REmap Options – which can be deployed by 2030 in addition to
the Reference Case� The cost supply curve has not been used to develop the
REmap, but is  representation of the REmap Options selected� This portfolio is
not an allocation of the global   additional potential based on the GDP of India
and other REmap countries, nor does it represent extrapolations� Further
technology portfolios can be generated, based on different understanding of the
parameters that constitute REmap Options or other studies specifically looking
at India� technologies, including power generation, heating, cooking and
transport� Substitution costs differ greatly by sector� They are cost-
competitive in the building sector from both  business and government
perspective, with  substitution cost of USD -/GJ to USD-/GJ, driven largely by
the economics of replacing traditional uses of biomass with modern renewable
energy� The transport sector has  very low incremental cost of USD �/GJ from the
business perspective, due to the effect of taxation on transport fuels, but
increases to USD /GJ from the government perspective when these taxes are
removed� The industrial sector has  narrow range of costs, from USD �-�/GJ from
the business and government perspectives, respectively, as  result of relatively
low taxation on fuels used in industry� The power sector has the highest average
cost of substitution at USD /GJ from the business perspective and USD /GJ from
the government perspective, largely due to the substitution of coal� However,
all costs presented here exclude any external cost reductions arising from the
REmap Options� Figure 26 and Figure 27 present two curves: the first is based on
the business perspective, incorporating the local cost of capital (at  10%
discount rate), commodity prices (including local taxes or subsidies), the
technology cost and performance characteristics: the second takes  governmental
perspective based on standard international commodity costs and  fixed 10%
discount rate� The former reflects factors likely to influence private
investment decisions; the latter factors more relevant to government decisions
on policy and spending� Decision makers will be tempted to pick low-cost
options, from the left end of the curve, and skip high cost options on the right
side, but the figure gives  perspective of the entire country� Decision makers
may assume that options represented by individual blocks in the supply curve are
homogenous in terms of substitution costs, but the blocks represent averages
based on the assumed deployments in the REmap� Viewed on  technology level the
cost supply curves give perspective on the competitiveness of individual
renewable energy technologies compared to incumbent conventional ones� The
substitution cost method and costs presented in the curves do not, however, take
into account some factors than can influence costs, such as externalities
relating to air pollution and climate change (which generally benefit renewable
technologies), or some system-related costs associated with deploying either
variable form of renewable power, or deployment and learning needs that may be
required if local communities are to experience  significant amount of end-use
renewable technologies� These costs are not limited to renewables, but tend to
be prevalent when new technologies are entering the market� The curve should not
be misinterpreted as  series of steps from left to right, in order of costs that
can be chosen or avoided in isolation� In fact, there are synergies and
interactions: all of these options need to be exercised together to achieve
these levels of costs and their indicated renewable energy shares� Some options,
for example, produce savings or efficiency improvements that help reduce the
costs of more expensive ones� Focusing on the cheapest individual options will
not result in the least expensive overall transition� That requires  holistic
approach� And neither curve includes the benefits relating to improved human
health or  better local environment that results from an increased deployment of
renewables� Looking at some individual technology options, it is easy to focus
on the left end of the curves� Here low- hanging fruit include technologies that
are competitive without further consideration of external costs, such as solar
thermal use for water heating in buildings� Inexpensive thermosiphon solar
thermal systems can be used on many dwellings and – since there is  trend of
increasingly using electricity for water heating in India – these systems are
very competitive is another by comparison� Biogas for cooking from  business
perspective, Observed the average cost of substitution with Remap Options is USD
�/GJ of final energy� Viewed from the perspective of governments, this cost
increases to USD �/GJ of final energy� To put them in perspective, they
represent around USD -11/MWh in additional cost if the entire portfolio of
technologies is deployed� The costs would be borne across the entire energy
system, by all energy services that are impacted by the renewable energy

the development of biogas systems, using anaerobic digestion, this competes well
on cost both with LPG and with India’ considerable use of traditional biomass in
inefficient cookstoves Other technologies that fall in the competitive or near-
competitive substitution cost range (negative to slightly positive) include
biomass and biogas applications in industry� Biogas produced either from
anaerobic digestion or fixed bed gasifiers is generally competitive, and biomass
residues used for process heat or produced in CHP systems are also attractive,
though cost slightly more than coal or natural gas alternatives� in savings�
When on-grid is compared to the wholesale price of generation, it is positive,
but would result in slight savings compared to retail electricity rates� When
considering costs and benefits, it is important to look beyond the technology
substitution costs presented in Figure 26 and Figure 27 since, as Table 10:
Financial indicators for shows, renewables provide important benefits to
society� There would, be an incremental energy system cost of USD 17 billion per
year, driven by positive substitution costs� Accounting for benefits resulting
from better human health and from lower emissions of CO2, however, means that
higher uptake of renewables could result in reduced external costs of USD 59
billion to USD 224 billion annually by 2030� Further to the right of the
government perspective curve are the main power sector technologies� Even though
many result in positive substitution costs, these do not include external
benefits relating to reduced air pollution and climate change� The importance of
including these is evident because all power sector technologies are assumed to
replace coal fired generation� The very significant growth in coal power
generation in the Reference Case means that most of the new renewable capacity
will have to replace it� And, though much of the coal will be imported, the
price is still very low� The result is positive substitution costs for most of
the power REmap Options except  few off-grid and rural systems that replace
diesel� Yet, despite this, many technologies still compete very well on costs�
Solar PV on  utility scale is only slightly positive, and onshore wind is also
slightly more expensive than coal� Rooftop solar PV is used both for rural and
off-grid applications, resulting The benefits of modern renewables, therefore,
far outweigh the slight increase in cost to the energy system� Most of the
benefit, ranging from USD 46 to USD 161 billion per year, is related to
reducedcosts associated with  lower detriment to human health, including indoor
and outdoor air pollution� The remaining USD  billion relates to reducing costs
associated with climate change� Total investment needs in renewable technologies
in REmap would average USD 42 billion between today and 2030� This is made up of
USD 16 billion annually taking place in the Reference Case, and an additional
investment of USD 26 billion due to the REmap Options� Of this USD 26 billion,
USD 21 billion would be necessary new investment (incremental investment) Table

Source: IRENA analysis REmap Options� No change in natural gas and nuclear
demand is estimated, as they are not substituted in the REmap analysis� In
comparison, total primary renewable energy supply increases by between 22% and
85% in REmap relative to the Reference Case, making it second only to coal� As
most of India’ oil is imported, and increasing amounts of coal are too, the
REmap Option would result in reduced dependence on fossil fuel imports� the US –
for an absolute reduction in emissions out of all 40 REmap countries� Together
these three countries could account for half of the potential reductions in
global emissions� Deploying renewables and reducing emissions in these countries
are therefore essential for both bringing about  transition in the global energy
system and for mitigating climate change� CO2 emissions savings resulting from
the REmap Options would be 75 Gt annually by 2030, or  reduction of around 16%
over the Reference Case level The reduction in fossil fuel use also has
important environmental benefits� In addition to avoided costs from air
pollution, valued at between USD  billion annually by 2030, there are also
savings that result from reduced CO2� India’ total CO2 emissions are estimated
almost to treble from � gigatonnes (Gt) in 2010 to � Gt by 2030 under the
Reference Case� The REmap Options would instead result in an estimated reduction
of �75 (Gt) by 2030 (Figure 29)� The largest decrease would occur in the power
generation sector, followed by transport� If all REmap Options were fully
deployed, India could reduce its CO2-related emissions from energy combustion by
around 16% from the 2030 Reference Case level (Table 11: Development of India
CO2 emissions, )� The monetary benefit of these savings can be valued at between
USD  billion annually by 2030�16 Important macroeconomic benefits would also
result from greater deployment of renewable energy� IRENA has conducted an in-
depth analysis based on REmap findings17 looking into the effects of renewable
energy on employment, GDP and welfare (IRENA, 2015e), which demonstrates that
renewable energy would have positive macroeconomic impacts across the board in
India� It shows, for example, that – if the REmap Options were deployed – GDP
would be around % higher in 2030 than under the Reference Case� Most of the
positive impacts on GDP can be explained by the increased investment required by
renewable energy deployment, which triggers ripple effects throughout the
economy� There are also important impacts on welfare, with India benefiting from
some of the greatest improvements observed in any REmap country, primarily as
response to the reduced health impact of in Indian CO2 emissions would Such
reductions contribute just under 10% of the global emission reductions, which
could be achieved if all Remap Options for doubling the share of renewable
energy in global energy were implemented by 2030� India has the third largest
potential – following China and 17 The analysis mentioned in this section was
conducted using REmap findings for India from the first REmap global report� The
findings are indicative of the results when higher deployment of renewable
energy occurs� It is important to note that, as the level of renewable energy
deployment in India in REmap has been expanded by subsequent analysis, the
findings presented in the report are likely to underestimate the level of
positive macroeconomic effects� 16 For more information on how IRENA estimates
external costs, please see the IRENA briefing note “The True Cost of Fossil
Fuels: Saving on the Externalities of Air Pollution and Climate Change” and its
accompanying methodology document (IRENA, 2016e)�   air pollution and greenhouse
gas emissions reductions� Developing economies are thus as likely as
industrialised ones to benefit from economic changes from more substantial
renewable energy deployment� Finally, there are important increases in
employment� India now has around 500 000 people working in the modern renewable
energy sector, and the study shows this could increase to � million in the
Reference Case, and to as much as � million in REmap –  seven-fold increase over
present levels� Employment in India is expected to increase substantially as it
scales up its ambition for solar PV and wind deployment: meeting its 2022 target
of 100 GW of solar alone is expected to create � million jobs (IRENA, 2015e)�
BARRIERS TO  RENEWABLE ENERGY TRANSITION This chapter goes into more detail
about some of the barriers to the renewable energy deployment detailed in the
last chapter, since accelerated deployment will present unique challenges that
go beyond – or could exacerbate – typical issues arising in India’ energy
sector� (excluding large hydropower that in 2015 amounted to an additional 40
GW)� The Government, under its 12th Five Year Plan, aims to boost renewable
energy capacity with ambitious capacity targets for solar, wind and other
sources� The country also has targets for end-use energy technologies and the
REmap Options outline how important many of these technologies are for meeting
the country’ long-term energy goals� One challenge in the years to 2030 relates
to issues associated with renewable power generation� Much of the technology
deployed in REmap will be variable and often split into more decentralised
generation units� Besides, increasing access to electrification will require
more rural power production systems� The result will be an increased strain on
India’ already stressed power grid� Solutions will be needed to reinforce,
expand and increase the flexibility of power infrastructure� REmap also directly
addresses end-use sectors, and specifically the use of traditional forms of
bioenergy for cooking and heating� Enabling  clean, affordable shift to modern
forms of renewable energy for heating and cooking will require significant
improvement of India’ bioenergy economy, including better utilisation of
residues and waste, and cleaner and more efficient combustion of bioenergy
feedstocks� Some of the key barriers to enabling the renewable energy technology
deployment identified above are listed in the following sections� They can be
broadly categorised into several key areas: ● Mobilising investment, high
upfront costs and the uncertainty of revenue generation; ● Difficulties in the
business environment; ● Required solutions for decentralised energy production
and storage; and ● Bioenergy challenges� � Mobilising investment Renewable
energy systems tend to be smaller in size, and incur high up-front investment�
As REmap shows, the incremental investment is needed for capacity, but savings
result from reduced fuel costs� Higher capital cost and investment schemes that
can value lower long-term operating costs resulting from smaller, or no, fuel
demand and fuel price uncertainty will need to be developed and made available�
They will be needed to expand access to the many rural communities and smaller
businesses that have local renewable energy potential, but insufficient capital
to develop their own capacity� Investment in renewables needs to gain impetus if
the targets are to be met and their great potential is to be tapped� The causal
factors impacting investments are shown in Figure 30� Investments are driven by
the expected rate of return and the business environment� In the renewable
energy sector, expected returns on investment are  function of the costs
involved and the revenue generated� Factors determining costs include: ● The
capital cost of the system� The costs of the technological infrastructure impact
investment, which like accelerated depreciation, viability gap funding and tax
benefits are used to counter the effect of high system costs; While this barrier
is likely to impact the deployment of renewables up to 2030, there are already
several existing challenges to deploying renewables in India� Installed
renewable energy power capacity grew from  mere � GW in 2003 to 42 GW by the end
of 2015 is why government incentives   Figure 30: Framework to evaluate
investments in renewable energy Based on CEEW analysis ● The cost of finance –
itself affected by regulatory incentives, interest rates and loan tenure – has
big impact on investment� Investment in renewable energy increases when finance
is available at affordable rates for long tenures; charges and/or granted first
access to the grid, the revenue for producers increases, further encouraging
Investment grows if there is favourable business environment long term
guarantees on policy providing measures, giving developers assurance of the
enforcement of obligations and incentive schemes and ensuring  fast and fair
legal framework to protect investments� investment� ● The cost of land forms
large proportion of the total cost of  renewable energy project� As land costs
are rising, investment continues to be adversely affected; The business
environment in the renewable energy sector is governed by such factors as: ● The
cost of evacuation infrastructure; ● The cost of storage, which is affected by
the share and scale of renewables; ● The certainty and longevity of policies,
which build investor confidence and encourage investment; ● Operations and
maintenance costs, which, when declining drive down total costs and encourage
investment� ● The timely enforcement of policies; the honouring of contracts and
the strong presence of the rule of law� Legally binding contracts guarantee
investors the option of legal recourse� This has  positive impact on investment
as it makes the process more secure and Revenues from renewables can be driven
by several factors, including: ● The extent and enforcement of renewable
purchase obligations; ● Operational ease for the developer, which in turn is
affected by several factors, such as ● The tariff at which renewable power is
sold, which can be affected by FiTs, tariff rebates, and generation-based
incentives; and — the approval time and the number of clearances required; —
access to information (pertaining to projects, ● Access to the grid, which is
affected by wheeling charges and priority dispatch to the grid� When renewables
are exempt from wheeling generation and irradiance); — the availability of
skilled manpower; and — the country’ standards of quality control�   Upfront
costs needed if India is to build significant renewable energy capacity, and the
country has reiterated numerous times that it is looking for  global mechanism
to help with some of the problems around hedging costs� Initial capital
requirements are significantly higher for renewable energy projects than for
conventional power plants� The cost of wind projects ranges from INR � to �85
crores per MW, and that of solar projects now ranges from INR � crore per MW for
utility scale ones to 10 crores per MW for rooftop and other decentralised
applications� System costs account for about 85% of the upfront costs with the
cost of finance, land and evacuation infrastructure together accounting for the
remaining 15%� One way to address this is through issuing tax-free bonds� Three
government owned agencies, including the Power Finance Corporation and IREDA,
are to raise more than USD 600 million in such bonds, and use the funding to
provide lower-cost finance to renewable energy project developers� Interest
rates as low as 10�% are said to be on offer (Cleantechnica, 2015b)� The New
Development Bank has also announced plans to issue bonds aimed at funding
renewable energy development: their aim could be to provide  source of finance
for the emerging set of projects resulting from auction programmes for renewable
power (Cleantechnica, 2016)� Financing can be particularly challenging for off-
grid systems� Schemes to help have been developed� MNRE’ flagship programme is
the ‘Solar Off-grid Refinance Scheme’ (Figure 31), which is operationalised by
IREDA through  network of banks and implementation partners identified by the
Ministry through  separate process (NREL, 2012)� Yet installed system costs are
rapidly falling, particularly for solar PV�  recent bid in Rajasthan in January
2016 set  record low for  supply contract in India, offering PV produced
electricity for under INR �34/kWh�18 The lower electricity production costs are
partly driven by lower equipment costs, but also by lower Energy Performance
Certificate costs, and by improving terms for financing� Funding renewable
energy projects in India has become progressively easier over the past few years
thanks to factors ranging from progressive fiscal policies to improved
understanding of the intricacies of renewable energy financing� This has helped
to overcome hurdles including the limited availability of financing options,
limited understanding of intricacies, and rigid and unfavourable debt contracts�
Governmental policies specifically focusing on renewable energy and on access to
finance for it have opened up  host of options for developers, ranging from
government- backed banks to non-banking financial institutions� This has led to
longer term tenures with additional refinancing options and favourable interest
rates� So,  strong impetus from the government, coupled with an enhanced
understanding of the sector, has given developers of renewable energy projects
in India an improved outlook on financing (Bloomberg, 2015)� Currency hedging
remains  problem, however� Investments made with local currency add - percentage
points to costs compared to those made with USD� So some types of projects can
have prohibitively high financing costs of %, and this is viewed unfavourably by
the many international financiers and investment companies interested in the
Indian market� International equity and investors will be Uncertainty of revenue
generation Uncertainty in generating revenues often results from inadequate or
low demand for solar power, the gap between the LCOE and the prevailing tariff
available on the market, and challenges associated with accessing the grid�
Surplus demand on the power exchange, and the way the low-cost of thermal-
sourced power is inhibiting states from procuring more renewable electricity,
are also issues� Lack of predictable demand for renewables The comparatively
high LCOE of renewable energy versus conventional fuels has previously caused
low demand� RPOs are intended to increase generation in states with high solar
irradiation, wind potential or biogasifier plants and to encourage trading with
states that have less potential� However, poor compliance with RPO mandates has
implied that the supply of RECs exceeds the demand on  monthly basis� As the
stock of unsold RECs grows, the future outlook for renewable energy demand looks
bleak unless robust enforcement of RPOs begins immediately� Auctions have
addressed some of the issues over the lack of predictable demand 18    Figure

accessing the grid for renewable-sourced power, and will help to provide more
revenue certainty for producers (see Box 11)� Wheeling and banking charges,
along with cross- subsidy surcharges, are levied on power producers who feed
power into the grid and add to developers’ project costs� Exempting renewable
energy producers from these charges – as is already happening for solar energy
in Karnataka – could increase expected returns on investment, However, this puts
burden on the utilities, so exemptions should only be given for short periods
(it is 10 years in Karnataka)� In the absence of storage technologies, renewable
energy projects are vulnerable to variable power production unless they can
access the grid and supply power on  priority basis� Gap between LCOE and
prevailing tariffs Until grid parity is reached and subsidies on fossil fuels
are reduced, there will be  gap between the tariff that distribution companies
are willing to offer to purchase power and the LCOE from some types of renewable
energy projects� The gap can be filled via  variety of incentives such as
preferential FiTs, generation-based incentives, or tariff rebates� Each is
applicable or effective for different types of renewable energy applications�
Box 11: Auctions Two types of mechanisms have been applied in India to reach its
renewable energy targets� FiT were applied for projects on  first-come, first-
serve basis: wind power has been the main beneficiary� The other mechanism has
been auctions where tariffs were quoted that comply with technical and financial
criteria� Solar power projects have been typically deployed through auctions�
The National Solar Mission has  committed systematic auction scheme� Between the
scheme’ first and second round the total capacity offered more than doubled, and
the price dropped by 28% (IRENA and CEM, 2015)� Under phase , batch  of the
National Solar Mission, 150 MW of solar PV capacity was allocated in December
2010 (PPAs were signed for just 140 MW)� Under Phase , batch II, 350 MW capacity
was allocated in December 2011 (PPAs signed for 340 MW)� Data from the period
between 2010 and 2013, suggests that auction tariffs for solar PV are moving to
market tariffs (Shrimali et al�, 2015)� Recent bids in 2015 and early 2016 have
significantly increased capacity deployment, and costs are falling to around INR
�-�/kWh (USD �06-�07/kWh), indicating that prices are at the lower range of the
Mission’ target (Gambhir, 2016)� There have been auctions in such developing
countries as China, Morocco, Peru, and South Africa (IRENA, 2013b) and
experience shows they are  cost-effective tool for deploying renewables by
ensuring that projects are allocated fairly� However, deployment was often
limited�  2015 study the Climate Policy Initiative (Shrimali et al�, 2015)
suggests ways of designing new auction systems by managing risks for cost-
effective and high deployment of renewables, especially wind power� The three
features suggested are : “() To increase cost-effectiveness, ensure sufficient
competition by setting the volume of capacity auctioned well within the market’
ability to supply; (ii) To improve deployment effectiveness, impose strong
penalties for delays in commissioning projects, implement support policies to
improve transmission infrastructure, and provide government guarantees to reduce
off-taker risk; and (iii) Use auction design elements that can mitigate risks to
achieve both cost-effectiveness and deployment effectiveness together� For the
specific case of wind energy in India, introduce auctions in  controlled
environment, in which the project site is already identified, transmission
infrastructure is planned, and resource assessment studies are completed prior
to bidding�” (Shrimali et al�, 2015)� � Enabling business environment investors�
Investment would benefit significantly from establishing single clearance
windows and expedition channels� Skilled manpower is also essential as it
impinges directly on the implementation and scale-up of projects: investors are
cautious about the returns on their investment in its absence� This issue can be
overcome by building local capacity development into renewable energy projects�
India’ renewable energy sector has suffered from delays in policy announcements
(as in launching Phase  of the National Solar Missions), frequent changes in
policy guidelines (including the type and quantum of incentives provided), and
changes in the agencies overseeing the implementation of policy� The absence of
strong policy framework reduced investor confidence and led to  sharp decline in
investment� It fell in the wind sector, for example, from USD � billion in 2011
to USD � billion in 2012, following the rollback of key governmental fiscal
benefits including accelerated depreciation adjustments� Investors often cite
such issues, such as limited availability of information about commissioned
projects, and project- related data including regional resource assessments, as
sources of rising perceived risk� The large number of clearances required, and
time taken for them, also deter � Challenges to decentralised energy The
Government of India runs several initiatives to increase distributed renewable
energy in rural areas, including the Ministry of Power’ Decentralized
Distributed Generation Scheme, started in 2009, which covers deployment of
renewable-energy-based mini grids� Similarly, the National Solar Mission, as
stated   � Skills development in Box , includes an off-grid systems component
and target� India will need to develop  skilled and knowledgeable workforce, if
it is to realise  significant growth in renewable power capacity, enable  secure
and strong future grid, and provide modern energy access to its population� The
lack of employees trained in the skills needed to construct and operate
decentralised renewable energy systems is an existing and ongoing challenge
which is recognised as  barrier to realising renewable energy targets� Yet,
despite these programmes, the decentralised energy market suffers from various
challenges� One is posed by public perception, which believes grid electricity
to be the only acceptable form of power, and this is compounded by the absence
of strong regulatory frameworks to mainstream distributed renewable energy� The
big challenge for distributed renewables is to develop business and financing
models that trigger rapid deployment and ownership, particularly at the
residential scale� The country has made an effort to create qualification
standards for its workforce� The Skill Council for Green Jobs and MNRE have been
working to integrate renewable energy curricula into training and skill
development institutions� Renewable energy coursework also has been promoted
into India’ Industrial Training Institutes (NRDC, 2016)� The decentralised
renewable energy market also suffers from  wide range of differing subsidies and
standards, which are often not monitored or implemented effectively� This,
together with lack of finance for small distributed energy systems that do not
enjoy investor confidence, further hinders the rapid uptake of distributed
renewable energy projects� The government has plans to develop  “Solar Army”,
providing new jobs for installers and operators of solar PV plants�  specially-
created association for renewable energy will help standardise and certify
renewable energy technologies, with dedicated shops for solar products�
Demonstration projects are planned, and India will strengthen its international
co-operation activities for them and for research and development� Integrating
large shares of variable power generation requires important consideration of
the planning for, and development of,  future grid� Detailed system analysis and
market design are key to enabling integration, and investment certainty needs to
be provided to utilities and system owners so as to enable growth in generation
assets and infrastructure� Integrating renewables into the power sector also has
endogenous implications for using the capacity of complementary generation
assets� Increased renewable penetration could lead to low capacity utilisation
for complementary assets that could be required to enable flexibility� �
Electricity storage The Government’ increased solar PV target of 100 GW in 2022
will increase the share of renewables from % to 10�%� MNRE is working with
states to understand how such an ambitious target would impact their generation
profiles, and what could be the possible challenges for evacuating power across
the transmission network� India has also been considering an increase from
installing  GW of wind energy  year to 10 GW� The recently-announced Green
Energy Corridor could help address some of these challenges� The project will
fund improvements in electric transmission systems to facilitate the transport
of power from areas rich in renewable energy to parts of the country where
demand for power is high (ADB, 2015)� Another interesting approach is the
development of solar-wind hybrid parks that can use transmission infrastructure
better by reducing the variability and production peaks of large renewable power
projects and thus demand on the grid� India is also pursuing further development
of mini and micro-grids: it issued  draft grid policy in early 2016 to allow for
developing power capacity in smaller grid systems (Bridge to India, 2016)� India
has many different geographical conditions ranging from deserts to long
coastlines to the highest mountain areas, which means that energy storage
technologies can be tested and explored in different scenarios� Its grid
infrastructure has difficulties in keeping up with demand growth: load-shedding
is coming, and peak prices have been introduced to reduce consumption�
Furthermore, India has  large programme to provide electricity to the 43% of
rural households without access   to distributed renewable power generation, in
the form of solar home systems or mini-grids� These can provide  quick solution
for electricity access, but back-up systems in the form of diesel generators,
bio-based power generation, or small hydropower or electricity storage would be
required to ensure that power is available around the clock� quickly to
fluctuations in power demand and supply� Fourthly, India’ distribution networks
have reported average losses of around 26%, with the worst averaging 54%�
Renewable power generation from wind and solar PV are rapidly increasing,
addressing the need for  more diversified power mix and additional generation
capacity across the country� Yet, at the same time, they require additional
measures to handle their variable generation patterns� The Green Energy Corridor
project focuses on strengthening interconnection across states, and there will
be nodal agencies within each state supported by  national platform and the
Ministry� MNRE recognises that deployment opportunities may differ substantially
among states depending on their population density, the need for power sources
in the agricultural sector, and requirements for rural electrification� It will
also focus on the opportunities for deploying solar PV on city rooftops and
close to existing power stations, as part of its ambitious plans� In total,  GW
could be deployed in  distributed manner� MNRE is also considering  policy to
oblige power producers expanding their fossil fuel fleet to pair it with at
least 10% renewable power generation� India is the world’ fifth largest
installer of wind power, and had  total installed capacity of 22 GW by the end
of 2014 (IRENA, 2015d)� The majority of which is in five states: Tamil Nadu (>
GW), Gujarat and Maharashtra (> GW), Rajasthan (>� GW), and Karnataka (> GW)�
These states are expected to add an additional 20 GW by the end of 2017� The
problem for integrating wind power generation into the grid is that the peak
wind season in some of these states (�� Gujarat and Tamil Nadu) runs from May to
August, whilst peak power requirements are in October, when wind resources are
low (CEA, 2013)� So wind contributes up to 35% of overall electricity
consumption per month in the wind peak season, but as little as % per month in
the peak demand season� Grid balancing has been achieved through reducing
generation in coal-based power plants in Tamil Nadu and gas-fired plants in
Rajasthan� However, the coal-fired power plants are relatively old and their
flexibility is constrained� Furthermore, using hydropower for regulation is
limited to non-irrigation- based installations which, in the case of in Tamil
Nadu, amounts to only � GW� These recent developments show that India
exemplifies many of the opportunities and challenges for storing electricity or
integrating renewables� It has tremendous renewable energy resources and plans
significant expansion of renewable capacity, especially for solar PV� However,
challenges to  high-level of deployment of solar PV include the strength of
local distribution grids, which may limit revenue streams for solar systems if
incentives for feeding in excess electricity are available� Electricity storage
for integrating utility-scale renewables Solar PV production mainly takes place
in utility-scale plants with  total installed capacity of around  GW (mainly
concentrated in Gujarat, which reached around  GW in 2014)� The government has
opened  number of solar 500MW to 2500 MW parks, which will allow 20 GW of solar
PV to be added to the grid between 2014 and 2019 through being connected to the
state or central transmission networks� India’ transmission and distribution
network faces  number of challenges simultaneously (India Electronics and
Semiconductor Association (IESA), 2014)� Firstly, it needs rapid expansion to
keep up with the growing demand, but there are administrative hurdles and delays
in the way� There has been  peak power deficit of around % (12 GW) (FICCI,
2013), and many cities have load-shedding and higher electricity prices to
reduce peak demand� Secondly, electricity supply and demand are not evenly
distributed across the country, requiring new inter-regional transmission
capacity� Thirdly, around 60% of the existing power generation capacity consists
of coal thermal plants, with limited capability to respond Distributed renewable
power generation can provide valuable system support to the grid: in Mahrashtra
it is providing voltage support at weak points� Renewables can also support
local reliability by allowing “islanding” of distribution networks when
surrounding grid is in fault/blackout (NITI Aayog, 2015)�   Electricity storage,
coupled to renewable power generation, can address any integration challenges
that are associated with utility-scale wind and solar PV plants, and some of
India’ regulatory regimes provide favourable circumstances� There is  surcharge
of INR �75/kWh for electricity production during peak times on the short term
energy exchange and many businesses and villages have diesel generation (at
cost of over INR 18/kWh) to guard against black-outs� Furthermore, the Indian
regulator uses Unscheduled Interchange (UI) and power factor incentives that
could be used to support the deployment of electricity storage (IESA, 2014)� The
Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) expects that 20 GW of flexible
generation, including storage and supercritical thermal generators, will be
required in 2016 (Power Grid Corporation, 2012)� It has three 50–250 kWh
demonstration projects in place in the context of its Frequency Response Pilot
Project, demonstrations include an advanced lead-acid,  lithium-ion, and  flow
battery� In 2012, over 43% of rural households did not have access to
electricity, but the country has extensive plans to rapidly increase
electrification and is extending distribution networks to connect rural
villages�20 Under the DDUGJV scheme, the Ministry of Power has sanctioned the
electrification of 124 786 villages, and the expansion of the electrification in
602 910 more� Connections to 108 913 un-electrified villages and intensive
electrification of another 314 160 villages has already been completed (MoP,
2014a)� At the same time, India is also supporting decentralised distributed
generation to villages which cannot be cost-effectively connected to the grid or
where there are only limited hours of supply� Decentralised distributed
generation projects receive 90% subsidies towards capital expenditure, and
connections to Below Poverty Line (BPL) households are financed with 100%
capital subsidies at INR  000 each� (MoP, 2013)� The household load for an
individual village is assumed to be 200 , and most electricity demand is for
lighting or businesses after sunset� Both individual solar home systems and
micro grids could be used to provide electricity, but storage systems or back-up
power would be required to provide electricity at night� The cheapest option for
storage is pumped hydropower� India has nine such schemes in place with an
aggregated installed capacity of almost  GW, but only five – with an aggregated
installed capacity of � GW – are actually working in pumping mode� The other
four have problems with vibrations or tail pool dams that have not yet been
constructed� Two more pumped hydropower storage plants, with an aggregated
capacity of 1GW, were under construction in 2013, and another �5GW of pumped
hydropower plans were being investigated� The CEA estimates the potential of
pumped hydropower at almost 100 GW, 40% in the Western region (CEA, 2013)� Most
decentralised distributed generation is based on diesel generators, which can
provide electricity at  nominal cost of INR 30/kWh� According to USAID, solar PV
coupled with advanced electricity storage systems produce electricity cheaper
than these diesel generators� IESA estimates that there is  market for energy
storage of around � GW for rural micro grids and  GW of grid connected rural
electrification� USAID examined the ability of energy storage systems to reduce
constraints in transmission capacity in Tamil Nadu, where it is underutilised
for  months per year (USAID, 2014)� Assuming capital costs of around INR
692/MW/day for the transmission network,19 they calculated that current battery
storage systems were not cost-effective and that their capital costs would need
to come down by 80%� Electricity storage for other applications There are
number of other markets for electricity storage in India� Many industrial and
commercial users (including clusters of small and medium-size enterprises) are
already deploying lead acid batteries or diesel generators to provide back-up
power� Advanced electricity storage systems could be used to replace traditional
back-up power sources, and to reduce the costs of peak pricing to industrial and
commercial users (USAID, 2014)� IESA estimates  market of around Electricity
storage for decentralised and off-grid deployment of renewables 20  village is
deemed electrified if 10%of all the households of the village has electricity
access and if electricity is provided to public spaces such as schools,
panchayat officers, health centres, community centres and dispensaries� 19 This
estimate is at least  factor of three lower than the costs of the transmission
network in the US (USD /kW/day for the US, compared to USD 27/kW/day in the case
of India)�   � GW for this application� Another option is to couple advanced
electricity storage systems to utility-scale renewable power generation plants
on site, allowing for smoothing the power generation mix (IESA estimates  market
of around  GW in 2022)� Finally, there is  large market for electricity storage
systems coupled to solar PV panels or small wind turbines for powering telecom
towers: only % of India’ some 740 000 such towers, are provided with renewable
power� (IESA expects  potential market of around 700 MW in 2022)� process
heating� No change in total demand for primary biomass (about  EJ) is expected
between 2010 and 2030, but – according to REmap – the 2030 market structure is
extended toward uses beyond cooking� Biomass use in 2030 is expected to have
notably increased in process heat generation (from � EJ to � EJ), in power
generation (from � EJ to � EJ) and in the transport sector (from negligible to �
EJ)� Supplying the considerable increase in biomass demand for such different
applications will require planning in the entire supply chain� Power and
manufacturing industry sectors will require the security of continuous supply�
Planning for the uptake of this biomass potential can accelerate deployment�
Meeting the demand for power and heat generation will mean that plants will need
to be located in areas with access to local biomass feedstocks, as will ethanol
and diesel production plants� Feedstocks can, of course, be transported, but
estimates show that – under unfavourable conditions – storage and transportation
costs can represent two- thirds of total biomass costs in India� Hence it will
be essential to assess biomass supply by region and to link this potential to
meeting demand� Available biomass feedstocks at present have several competing
uses beyond energy applications where practices vary from state to state� Such
uses of biomass will also need to be considered in planning for the increased
demand, and the use of feedstocks that do not compete with these applications
should be prioritised (Ravindranath, 2005; Natarajan et al�, 2015)� � Bioenergy
challenges Biomass would account for  significant share of India’ total final
renewable energy use in 2030 if the potential of all the technology options
identified in REmap were deployed� The estimated demand for primary energy in
REmap is  EJ, less than IRENA’ supply potential estimate of �-� EJ in 2030� The
country has the potential to supply its demand domestically with its own
resources� There are challenges in realising this potential� One is the market
environment for rural sustainable bioenergy use compared to fossil fuels, which
still receive subsidies in parts of the energy system, particularly for rural
energy needs (see Box 12)� It will be important to develop government programmes
to increase awareness and local and regional modern cook stove initiatives that
can ensure affordable and reliable equipment� If feedstock is available, biogas
can be  cost-effective option� The Government has funded many household biogas
installations – running, for example, on cattle waste – over past decades, but
many have fallen into disuse� Government funding resulted in beneficiaries not
always being motivated to maintain systems financially, or lacking the knowledge
to do so� Training in maintenance and requiring  financial stake in systems will
help ensure they are kept running for years� Household programmes can be
expanded to the commercial scale, and there is significant potential for biogas
development if commercial scale plants can be set up in large hotels, sewage
treatment plants, and industry� While managing biomass feedstocks is  serious
challenge for bio-energy projects, there are also others� Concerns were raised
in the 1980s and 1990s about the growing practice of head-loading firewood to
cater for needs in small towns and large cities with flourishing firewood
markets� As such markets become an important source of income and livelihoods,
the questions arise of whether there will be  tendency to exploit biomass
resources unsustainably and even illegally� There have been reports of women in
some rural areas having to walk even greater distances than usual to collect
firewood, or having to switch to inferior fuels such as shrubs, roots, weeds, or
loose crop residues (AIREC/SSEF, 2014)� Today’ bioenergy market focuses mainly
on household cooking, with smaller amounts used for industrial   Box 12: Fossil
fuel subsidies Another important and major challenge hindering the growth of
renewable energy – and financial investment – is the way and level at which
traditional energy is priced� Administered pricing and associated subsidies
create  situation where subsidised fossil fuels – or energy derived from them –
tends to be significantly cheaper than the market price, leading to  skewed
marketplace in which renewables have to compete� Government spending on
subsidies for petroleum products — which was as high as INR  39 869 crore (USD �
billion), or about �% of GDP in 2013 — limits the government’ spending
elsewhere, including increasing the capital investment in renewables� Investment
in renewables can yield significantly greater returns than such purely
consumptive spending as with subsidies� This issue is high on the agenda both in
India and in international forums like the G20, which has made fossil fuel
subsidies  topic for discussion and action� In India, the issue is exemplified
by: Subsidised kerosene – competing with decentralised renewables The subsidy
associated with kerosene, widely used as  primary lighting source in rural
India, is exorbitant� Subsidised kerosene is priced at INR 14/litre, and is not
available anywhere in the country at market price� India imports almost 80% of
its petroleum (crude and products) consumption, and kerosene is subsidised by
more than 70% in terms of import price parity� So the final consumer pays less
than  third of the actual cost of the fuel� This has two implications for
decentralised renewables� First, subsidised kerosene competes with the
decentralised lighting solutions based on such renewables as solar� Second,
since it is so cheap, it is heavily black marketed and adulterated into
‘subsidised’ diesel to use as auto-fuel and to run irrigation pumps in areas
with poor electricity availability – leading investment in renewable energy
based options like solar pumps being unviable� Subsidised electricity, in
generation mix with an 80% contribution from thermal sources Another way in
which some Indian states heavily subsidise fossil-fuel-based energy is by
subsidising electricity to the end consumers, especially domestic and
agricultural ones� Thermal, essentially coal-based, plants contribute as much as
80% of the country’ generated electricity� Hence any subsidy to electricity
invariably subsidises coal consumption to  significantly higher extent than
renewables�    SUGGESTIONS FOR ACCELERATED RENEWABLE ENERGY UPTAKE ● Developing
and using renewable energy is  priority� It helps to address the growing
challenge of energy demand and to enhance the security and diversity of energy
supplies� Based on the existing policy framework discussion and on barriers to
renewable energy in India in the previous sections, this chapter provides
suggestions with following five themes: Maintaining the longevity and
credibility of policy support: prematurely cutting off support for projects
investor confidence and apprehension for project developers, often prohibiting
new ones from entering the market� India’ renewable energy projects respond to
postitive incentives, such as accelerated depreciation and generation-based
incentives, which need to be stable and not revised mid-term; leads to
plummeting � Establishing transition pathways for renewable energy � Creating an
enabling business environment ● Increasing outreach to banks and establishing
Green Bank: domestic banks should be encouraged to see renewables (especially
wind and solar) as credible business opportunities� Policies driving the
creation of  Green Bank are critical for injecting new liquidity and reducing
the cost of capital for renewable energy projects� Green banks offer low cost
capital at lower interest rates than is available in private sector
transactions� Multilateral financing and self- financing provide the majority of
the funding of ongoing renewable energy projects� With international funding
expected to decline, it is critical to have policies to abate the risks
perceived by domestic banks and to increase lending; � Integrating renewable
energy � Managing knowledge; and, � Unleashing innovation� � Establishing
transition pathways Like most countries, India has national plans and targets,
indicating its long term commitment to renewable energy� Onshore wind, solar PV,
small hydropower and biogas cogeneration are the most active renewable energy
technologies, with wind contributing the lion’ share of the total capacity and
other technologies still in their infancy� Initiatives planned for the coming
years include  greater focus on solar PV, offshore wind, CSP and cogeneration
from bagasse for distributed renewable power� Assessments of these technologies’
potential indicate that policy and & support will ensure the deployment of all
types of renewables, avoid any technology lock-in, and accelerate the overall
renewables contribution to the energy mix� ● Using infrastructure debt funds for
investment in renewable energy: long-term debt lines and lower interest rates
offered by such debt funds can enable the renewable energy market to expand�
Infrastructure debt funds can act as  conduit for debt financing into
infrastructure projects with more favourable terms� An appropriate project
authority, such as IREDA, could provide guarantees to make this tool effective;
and This section includes recommendations that propose coherent and economically
feasible policies� The relatively high cost and low availability of debt in
India significantly increases the cost of renewable energy projects� Thus the
financing woes of the renewable energy sector could be mitigated by: ● lending
Establishing priority sector for renewables, by which they are unbundled from
other power projects, thus boosting low-cost financing for them� Installations
of distributed renewable energy systems already benefit from having access to
priority sector lending status,   � Enabling business environment and this could
be extended to grid connected renewable energy� Unbundling renewables from the
existing power sector, with independent lending limits for the renewable energy
sector, would increase the availability of domestic financing� Policy frameworks
that provide  level playing field for renewable energy and facilitate the
formation of markets must be developed� The lack of ease in doing business poses
great challenge for up scaling renewables in India� Policy instability, delays
in clearances, clearance malpractices and the absence of clear information all
deter the move towards increasing the share of renewables in the country’ energy
mix� Policy efforts to counter these problems include: Other policies can also
catalyse the transition to  higher renewable energy future: ● Improving the
enforcement of RPOs to signal renewable energy demand clearly� Uncertainty over
RPO enforcement and over the future of RECs reduces lender confidence� The
states of Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu have already made moves towards improving RPO
enforcement; ● Timely implementation of policies and incentives, these will be
essential in encouraging investor confidence� Existing policies, shackled by
tardy bureaucratic procedures, significantly hamper investor and project
developer interests� Policies to counter red tape are critical; ● Creating
conducive land acquisition policies: land acquisition policies like those in the
states of Gujarat and Rajasthan are essential to give  boost to renewable energy
projects� As discussed in this report, the cost of land imposes  significant
cost on solar and wind projects� State government policies, which designate land
for the development of such projects, while taking local conditions and
sensitivities into account, could counter the problem of land acquisition and
the high cost of land; ● Transparent bidding processes with rigorous selection
criteria are crucial for overall stakeholder participation, and especially for
attracting serious players� This would ensure that projects are allocated to
actors who have the ability to ensure project completion and attract financing�
These projects must be monitored to make certain that they operate at the
contracted capacity, feed power into the grid, follow mandates for quality
standards etc�; ● Introducing net metering policies to tap into the large
potential for decentralised (rooftop) renewable energy production in India� Net
metering systems would allow households to feed excess power back into the grid,
thus increasing the use of renewables; ●  single window clearance facility with
time- bound clearances for new projects should be established, as has been done
by state regulatory agencies in, for example, , Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh�
Single clearance and time- bound clearances enable project developers to
anticipate accurately the time and effort required to get project clearance, and
improve investor confidence by providing  greater degree of certainty and ease
of operation in the renewable energy market; ● Encouraging farmers to grow
biofuel crops under rain-fed rather than irrigated conditions� Such  policy
would boost agricultural returns in rain- fed areas, and provided competition
with food crops can be avoided, would minimise the risk of inducing food
insecurity; ●  nationwide training programme for renewable energy technologies
should be designed and instituted under the National Skills Development Council�
The transition to an energy future with  significantly larger share of renewable
energy is partly contingent on the availability of  skilled and trained
workforce� The Government has announced that around 11 000 solar technicians ●
Shifting to alternative (and more energy- efficient) chemicals to reduce HFC
emissions in the residential air-conditioning sector; and ● Developing  national
biomass mission�   were trained in 2015 – to be joined by another 50 000 between
2016 and 2019 – to build  ‘Solar Army’ to meet the ambitious solar energy
targets� The workers will receive training under the government’ national skill
development mission at such organisations as the industrial training institutes
(ITIs)� ● information and Encouraging the use of communication technology (ICT)
to manage peak load, especially in metro cities� This can be used for demand
management, thus enabling consumers to modify their use of power based on the
load on the grid� Similarly, the utilities can use it to manage loads,
congestion and shortfalls� ICT initiatives would also reduce the cost of stand-
alone energy storage; ● Costs and benefits must be considered when developing
new policies� Cleaning up power plants, for example, results in health benefits
worth twenty-five times the cost� ● In systems where losses are high because of
the geographical spread of the grid system,  larger number of lower-capacity
substations, together with the conversion of single-phase supply to three-phase
supply, would reduce these losses substantially� Designing systems with “slack
capacity” is also important by considering the trade-off between upfront
investment and distribution costs; and � Smooth integration of renewable energy
Significant delays in deploying renewable energy are caused by the high costs of
evacuation infrastructure, wheeling charges etc� Project developers need to be
given incentives, like first access to the grid in the form of priority dispatch
schemes etc�, if renewable energy is to be scaled up� The sector still requires
significant support and facilitation to ensure timely and adequate evacuation
infrastructure� Policies to this effect include: ● Improving the grid as  top
priority in mitigating constraints in power supply� � Managing and creating
knowledge ● Exempting renewable energy projects from wheeling, banking and
cross-subsidy charges, as already happens in states like Maharashtra and
Karnataka�  policy to this effect would provide exemption for  fixed period,
usually  years from commissioning of the plant� This reduces the cost of the PPA
for industrial and commercial consumers alike; Data on renewable energy is often
incomplete and difficult to collect, posing  significant challenge both for
investors and for policy makers� The need for up-to-date, comprehensive data is
well understood, and initiatives to collect it continue� Yet additional efforts
are required to provide it inexpensively to project developers and financiers in
order to reduce their perception of risk� This includes data on existing and
potential projects, various actors in the market and government policies� Thus,
renewable energy deployment will benefit from policies to: ● Establishing  for
setting up roadmap sub-stations and transformers� Policies to systematically
upgrade grid infrastructure for power evacuation are specifically needed to
improve energy access and electrify villages without power� Several states,
including Bihar, are already developing plans for additional sub- stations and
transformers; ● Improve data collection from developers on the status of
projects, capacity added per year and jobs created� This would enable policy
makers to formulate better support frameworks and investors to have  better
understanding of the market, which, in turn could drive up investment; ●
Ensuring priority dispatch for renewable energy� This would mean that power from
all grid-connected renewable energy projects, is guaranteed grid access,
irrespective of project size or the load at the time; ● Establish information
platforms for lending institutions to encourage partnerships between banks to
syndicate loans, share experiences, etc�   Box 13:  proposal for  National
Biomass Mission Biomass from agricultural residues and from forests and
wastelands presents  huge potential for energy generation in India� Preliminary
estimates for the potential of power from biomass – based on agricultural
production levels for 2012 and the biomass surplus available from forests and
wastelands – suggests that the total untapped potential was close to 41 GW, in
addition to the energy generated and used in cogeneration plants� This estimate
takes into account all the competing uses of biomass – including as  traditional
fuel for cooking and heating, and fodder for livestock – and has mapped the
resource potential from surplus biomass alone� As agricultural output increases
in the years ahead, the biomass available for power production is also set to
rise� Thus, an aggressive target of 25 GW of biomass power (electricity and co-
generation) by 2020 would be achievable even though power and cogeneration from
biomass now stands at  mere � GW� Proposed National Biomass mission ● Term:  ●
Capacity target: 25 GW ● Investment required: USD �75 billion ● Average size: -
MW plants (5000 plants of 5MW each) ● Land requirement:  acre/MW ● Land
footprint: �14% of India’ total wastelands ● Employment generated: approximately
62 500 full time jobs in operations and maintenance and several additional jobs
in construction, fuel collection, processing and transportation Moreover,
cogeneration – most applicable in industries – has  large potential in India’
sugar industry, which has traditionally practised it using bagasse as fuel� With
advanced biomass cogeneration units for generation and using steam from cane
residues at high temperature and pressure, the sugar industry can produce
electricity and steam to meet its entire energy demand, as well as surplus power
in the range of 80 kWh/ of cane crushed� The capital cost of installing
bagasse-based cogeneration project is almost identical to the cost of  biomass
power plant, in the range of USD 718  000/MW (INR 45 million-50 million/MW)� The
cost of generation varies between USD �05-�06/kWh (INR �25-�75/kWh), depending
on the plant’ load factor (PLF) and the interest rate on term loans� The average
life of  biomass power plant is close to 20 years, but can be extended to 30
with major restoration work� While India’ potential for biomass-based energy is
large, one of the major practical obstacles is the availability and acquisition
of land� At least  acres ( hectare) of land is required for approximately  MW of
installed capacity of biomass power generation� Biomass power plants are most
economically viable when they have  capacity of between  MW and 10 MW:   MW
plant requires an average input of 50 000 kg of biomass per day� Unlike other
renewables, biomass requires large tracks of land for fuel storage� Yet just
�14% of India’ total wastelands would suffice for 25 GW of biomass power�
However, collection, transporting and storing biomass often imposes significant
added costs, and an absence of readily available input fuel and adequate storage
space raises transport costs, further compounding the challenge of fuel linkages
and transport� Our proposed mission suggests establishing multiple decentralised
small scale biomass plants – which require relatively lower investment in both
land and fuel – to counter these challenges� Biomass power generating units
provide significant economic benefits in addition to the electricity they
produce�  10 MW project could create employment for about 100 workers during its
18-month construction phase, 25 full-time workers in operating the facility, and
35 people in collecting, processing, and transporting biomass material� The
recommendations below are made in the context of  proposed National Biomass
Mission, with  target of 25 GW of biomass power, including both cogeneration and
power plants (The challenges to renewable energy scale-up identified in chapter
and the recommendations made in chapter  are also applicable to biomass)�
Promote the distributed biomass market to improve procurement There is an
abundant surplus of biomass available in India� However, high collection and
transport costs often become  hindrance in executing biomass power generation
projects effectively� Instituting district biomass markets, to which
agricultural residues and biomass collected from wastelands and forests can be
brought for sale, would go  long way in addressing this gap� Such formal markets
could enable larger producers to source their biomass easily from many of them
at  time� Furthermore, easy access to biomass could encourage entrepreneurship
and allow decentralised producers to set up plants� Pilot projects should be
initiated in such key agricultural states, as Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,
Bihar and West Bengal, to test the viability of decentralised procurement and
production of biomass-based energy� Develop an information portal to catalogue
and update biomass availability Cataloguing can be done by crop type, region,
season, calorific value, quality and price� Such information could be collected
at  district level, with MNRE collating it within  usable platform� This could
go  long way to increasing confidence in market dynamics for what is still
nascent sector� Mandate biomass cogeneration in certain industries, such as the
sugar industry MNRE already provides several incentives for bagasse cogeneration
plants such as accelerated depreciation, tax holidays, and exemption from excise
duty� Such incentives, if combined with  minimum enforced requirement to meet
captive demand from biomass, could drive growth in biomass cogeneration plants
deployment� Offer  FiT specific to biomass generation Biomass power plants are
lucrative only if  FiT is provided to the producer for units of energy fed into
the grid� Estimates suggest that the cost of production stands at USD �06/kWh,
so utilities must buy each unit of power for more than this� Reverse auctioning
could be used to determine the lowest cost outlay from public funds� The
National Clean Energy Fund could be used to finance the FiT, although state
utilities could also contribute by including biomass cogeneration towards
fulfilling their RPOs� Rigorous project selection criteria In order to draw
serious players able to source and store biomass, attract financing and ensure
project completion; the proposed National Biomass Mission should have stringent
guidelines for choosing projects in  reverse auction bidding process� Such
guidelines are especially applicable for independent biomass power plants where
the input has to be externally sourced, as opposed to the cogeneration units in
the sugar industry where bagasse is available on site� The developer’ proposed
provisions for the purchasing, transport and storage of biomass should be borne
in mind when projects are allocated� Offer government land (wastelands) or lease
it at concessional rates for the lifetime of the project Land availability poses
significant challenge, but it could be overcome if such schemes as leasing
government land were instituted, similar to Rajasthan’ policy solar projects�
The sale of  small proportion (��  minimum of  acres) of wastelands to the
developers of biomass projects should be mandatory in each administrative block
of every state� Establish renewable energy parks Given the shortage of land
available for harnessing renewables, mixed land use could be promoted� The same
site would have multiple operating renewable energy systems – such as having
biomass storage units with solar PV panels on their roofs – thus using the land
in the most efficient way� Research and Development of innovative gasification
technology and hybrid crops Funds allocated by MNRE to encourage research into
gasifiers that have improved the efficiency or development of biomass
polygeneration units could go  long way to boosting the biomass’ share of power
in the Indian energy mix� Research into hybrid hardy seed types that can be
grown in wasteland plantations should be encouraged, as this could solve the
input fuel challenge faced by independent biomass plants� Grants worth USD 100
000 could be instituted to assist researchers in such an endeavour�   This would
be particularly helpful for co-financing projects; increasing the efficiency of
solar panels or the durability of wind turbines, lowering the cost of balancing
systems (including storage), or of distributed energy in areas that are hard to
reach� Such targeted prizes could stimulate innovation in technologies and
business models with the ultimate aim of increasing access to clean energy; ●
Particularly focus on nexus issues (water and energy); and ● Improve air
pollution emission standards to the level of those in developed countries� ●
Support partnerships: Policies that support north-south and south-south co-
operation in the form of joint research and development, international funding
of domestic research, tied project funding for piloting new technologies etc�
help in furthering the available renewable energy technology� Partnerships like
the Joint Clean Energy Research and Development Centre between India and the US
lead to  significant commitment to research and development� This partnership
committed USD 50 million, equally shared by the two countries, for research on
efficient buildings, second generation biofuels, and solar energy� The
government funding was augmented by joint research consortia contributing the
equivalent of USD 75 million; � Unleashing innovation Renewable energy
deployment around the world is continuously benefiting from innovation, whether
in technological improvements, new applications of existing technologies, new
business and financing models, or innovative and inclusive policy mechanisms�
India, with its endemic problem of access to energy, has seen much innovation in
low cost renewable energy applications and constantly evolving distribution and
financing models� It should: ● Develop building codes in cities to include
renewable energy standards for all new buildings developed as part of  housing
complex� Guidelines could include mandatory district cooling systems, solar
water heating, energy efficient lighting etc�; ● Develop  government approved
crowdfunding platform� Such  platform for distributed renewable energy projects
ratified by MNRE would help project developers raise finance and would build
investor confidence, as the projects would have government clearance� Such
portal could bridge the gap between financiers and small developers; and ●
Promote technological development in energy storage, water saving technologies
for CSP plants, energy monitoring and devices for system balance� Policies that
promote and incentivise technological advances in these fields, both
domestically and in the form of joint research, are crucial for the long term
scaling up of renewable energy in India; ● Additional measures can include:
instituting an energy access prize to drive innovation in decentralised
generation; the government partnering with energy efficient economies to develop
best-practices to reduce growing demand; exploring additional partnerships on
energy storage &, energy service company business models; and developing
coalition for low-carbon rural development (including for agriculture, water,
climate and livelihoods facing climate risks)� ● Reward innovation and domestic
manufacturing� In the light of the Government’ Make in India campaign, an
effective mechanism to support domestic manufacturing and in renewable energy
technology, distribution and financing mechanisms could be rewarded with
monetary prize and certification of excellence� Prizes could be targeted, on,
for example, innovation   REFERENCES ADB (Asian Development Bank) (2015), India:

assessment methodologies in petroleum prices; advanced biofuel estimates
originated from IRENA’ own estimates� All biomass feedstock prices are based on
IRENA bottom-up analysis (IRENA, 2014c)� Electricity prices were assumed to
increase 30% over 2010 levels, which is based on the average price increase of
conventional energy carriers, but also taking into account the changes in the
fuel mix of the power sector with renewables� Two examples are provided to
explain how the substitution costs are estimated: ● Biomass boiler substituting
LPG-based boiler: The difference between the annualised capital, operation and
maintenance and energy costs of the two boiler systems to deliver the same
amount of heat are estimated, thereby taking into account the conversion
efficiency, size of capacity, lifetime, capacity factors, etc� This is divided
by the total final biomass demand of the boiler required to deliver that heat�
In the government case, for coal, India was assumed to largely remain  domestic
producer, therefore the lower price option was used� Electricity prices are
based on national prices as described in the business case, but with the effect
of taxes removed� For natural gas India was assumed to be an importer of natural
gas and the higher price was used� Natural gas and coal prices were based on
import/export price estimates from the IEA (2012)� Petroleum prices are
standardised for the world and indexed to expected developments in the price of
crude oil based on IEA (2012)� Liquid biofuel prices are IRENA estimates with
the effect of taxes or subsidies removed� Biomass fuel prices are regionalised
to the Asia (non-OECD) region� ● Wind power substituting existing coal-based
power: The difference between the annualised capital, operation and maintenance
and energy costs of the two power systems to deliver the same amount of
electricity are estimated, thereby taking into account the conversion
efficiency, size of capacity, lifetime, capacity factors, etc� In the case of
existing coal-based power, there are no capital costs as the capacity is assumed
to be depreciated already� This difference is divided by the total renewable
electricity generated from the wind power capacity� Two detailed methodology
document are available online detailing the approach used to calculated external
cost and substitution costs, system costs, and investments: For the business
case, energy prices were estimated based on  number of methods� For some
multipliers, expected developments in energy prices for the period between 2010
and 2030 were used based on the IEA projections and these were applied to
national 2010 prices� For the case of coal, import prices were used; for natural
gas, Asian regional import prices were used; for oil products, IEA crude oil
import price projections were used (IEA, 2012)� For conventional liquid biofuel
prices, growth in price was matched to expected development REmap cost

= REmap 2030 ) Reference case is based largely on Planning Commission 2014 (BiG
scenario)� The reference case for the power sector incorporates targets based on
the Twelfth Five-Year Plan to 2017; exceptions are for Solar PV (see note ),
wind (see note ), and biopower (based on IRENA assessments)� The Reference Case
assumes reaching  60 GW target by 2019, and continued linear growth until 2030�
This would result in just under  GW capacity additions per year between 2015 and
2030� Recent wind capacity installations have exceed  GW per year, so
significant increase� For REmap yearly capacity additions increase by 25% to 10
GW year� REmap Options also include 14 GW additional to meet the increased
electricity demand in end-use sectors in REmap 2030 Reference case and REmap
Options are based on  mix of sources compiled by IRENA which are explained in
more detail for each technology in footnotes -� Based on van Ruijven, Schers and
van Vuuren (2012), it is assumed in Reference Case that by 2030, more than 95%
of all rural electrification needs (representing about 390 million people in
2030) are met compared to about 50% in 2010 levels� While all of this is
possible by grid- connection� Various renewable energy-based off-grid
technologies can also play  role� Their potential and cost-effectiveness depends
on the demand load and the capital costs relative to the grid & transmission
costs� Potential of solar PV off-grid and wind/diesel mini-grid systems range
from -100% according to the results of this study� In Reference Case, it is
assumed that one-third of the total rural electrification needs can be met by
off-grid/mini-grid systems� Assuming 250 kWh/household ( capita/household),
total power need of rural areas that do not yet have power access is equivalent
to 19� TWh/yr, and � TWh/yr to be supplied by renewable energy off-grid systems�
It is assumed that half of this total can be supplied by solar home systems (�
GW, capacity factor of  300 hours/year), forty percent by biomass systems that
include gasifiers and biomethanation (� GW, both with capacity factor of  100
hours/year), and the remainder ten percent by wind systems (� GW, capacity
factor of  000 hours/year)� With these developments,  total of � GW off-grid
capacity would be installed in India by 2030, compared to today’ level of 117 MW
(end of March 2014) that is dominated mainly by solar home systems� Biomass
gasifiers also play  role in urban areas (� GW), in particular, in industrial
systems, but in the Reference Case, about half of what their potential would be
in rural areas� For REmap 2030, full power access is assumed that raise the
total power needs to 21 TWh/year compared to 19� TWh/year in the Reference Case�
It is assumed that half of this total demand would be met by off-grid/mini-grid
systems with biomass gasifier and biomethanation systems accounting for forty
percent of this total (� GW installed capacity) and wind  quarter (� GW)� The
remainder 35% would be provided by solar home systems (� GW in total)� Solar
systems also play  role for telecom towers that are growing in number in India�
Today there are about 740 000 tower of which 70% are in areas of less than 16
hours grid supply� Total diesel consumption to ensure continues power supply
today has reached � billion litres, and by 2030 it can reach about  billion per
years to generate about 30 TWh per year electricity� There is  potential to
substitute about 70% of the total power needs with off-grid systems that would
require about 17 GW solar systems in 2030 (with capacity factor of about  750
hours/year)� ) ) )    ) For power-alone solid biomass combustion systems,  total
potential of about 23 GW is estimated, with 18 GW from agricultural/forestry
residues and  GW from energy crops ( However, for India’ total biomass supply in
2030, IRENA has estimated no dedicated energy crop potential� Of this total 18
GW potential (based on today’ residue generation factors),  total of 10 GW is
assumed for REmap 2030, compared to  GW capacity in 2010� For the Reference
Case, total installed capacity is assumed as  GW� For waste-to-power systems,
the potential today is about  GW (based on today’ waste generation factors)� For
REmap 2030,  GW is assumed that would be much less than the potential in 2030
given India’ increasing population and economic growth that would result in
higher volumes of waste being generated� In 2010, total installed cogeneration
capacity in India’ sugar mills was about � GW (electric-capacity)� These plants
generate about  TWh/yr, based on  capacity factor of 35% (considering both on-
season and off-season, and based on mills in Uttar Pradesh), total power
generation of 85 kWh per tonne of bagasse�  total of 80 Mt/yr wet bagasse is
produced (with  lower heating value of approximately - MJ/kg), of which 70 Mt is
used for captive power generation� Information about total heat production from
cogeneration plants is limited, one source ( states around  (power-to-heat of �)
but that in the actual situation it is likely lower, so an order of  compared to
total power generation (so  power-to-heat ratio of about �15) is assumed�
According to Vision 2030 for sugar industry, total sugar cane production would
grow to 520 Mt/yr by 2030� This would generate 120 Mt/yr wet bagasse� Based on
today’ level of wet bagasse use for power cogeneration (70 out of 80 Mt wet
bagasse), this would have  potential to install � GW power capacity (at slightly
improved efficiency levels and using 100 Mt/yr wet bagasse) in the Reference
Case� An additional  GW biomass-fired (non-bagasse) CHP capacity is assumed for
distillery, dairies and rice mills which today have  combined CHP potential of
GW (Singh, Singh and Mahla, 2013), or about  GW by 2030 with total industrial
energy use doubling in India between 2010 and 2030� In REmap 2030, efficiency is
double compared to today’ levels, but less bagasse is used since  share of the
total generated is allocated to advanced biofuels production (80 Mt/yr with the
remainder 20 Mt being used for advanced biofuel production); this results in  GW
power generation capacity in REmap 2030� Half of the potential in non-bagasse
sectors ( GW) is assumed in addition that take the total industrial biomass-
fired CHP capacity to 10 GW (running with  capacity factor of about  300
hours/year, and  power-to-heat ratio of �25)� Reference Case assumes achieving
20 GW target by 2022, and an installation rate of just over  GW/year in the
timeframe� It does not include the recently proposed 100 GW target by 2022,
which is accounted for instead in the REmap options, which then assumes growth
rate increase from 12 GW/year to 15 GW/year for the time period � This would
result in yearly capacity additions of just over 13 GW� Share of utility-scale
(80%) and distributed generation (20%) are estimated based on an IRENA
assessment� REmap Options include an additional 14 GW additional capacity of
utility-scale solar PV to meet the increased electricity demand in end-use
sectors in REmap 2030� REmap Options based on IRENA Assessment� ) ) ) ) 10)
REmap Options based on CEEW� 11) Reference Case and REmap 2030 estimates for the
building sector are based on CEEW� For the industry sector, estimates are based
on IRENA’ Renewable Energy in Manufacturing report and assume that some low and
medium temperature heat (less than 400 oC) can be met with solar thermal that
would account for about % of the total energy needs for process heat generation�
Compared to total demand this may be  low number, but given the growing size of
India’ manufacturing industry, the absolute volume of solar thermal heaters
installed is significant� For buildings, solar cookers account for % of the
total substitution of traditional use of biomass in the Reference Case that
would require 10 GW (14 million m2 or - million solar cookers, based on 10%
capacity factor) capacity in REmap 2030� By 2017 the target is to have � million
home units, � school units, �05 community cooking units� The remainder of solar
thermal is additional capacity for heating (83 GW) and cooling (� GW) that
represents about % of building sector’ TFEC� Heating is predominantly for water
heating whereas solar cooling substitutes �03% of the total power use of air
conditioning systems in 2030 (700 TWh/yr compared to total building power demand
of  450 TWh/yr)� 12) Reference Case is estimated based on 2010 IEA energy
balance with no increase in heat production in the Reference Case� REmap option
is based on IRENA RE in manufacturing assessment� 13) In Reference Case 2030,
total traditional and modern uses of biomass increase only slightly by %
compared to total fuel demand growth of the building sector of 63% between 2010
and 2030, with no change in their share of the total building biomass use�
Hence,  considerable share of the total traditional uses of biomass are being
substituted with LPG/kerosene� In REmap 2030, full substitution of traditional
uses of biomass is assumed with  mix of modern biomass technologies and solar
cookers (see footnote 11 for solar cookers)� Gasifiers and biogas plants that
are already used in large amounts would account for 45% of the total modern
biomass needs (about 30% conversion efficiency) and another half would come from
solid biomass use in modern cookstoves (25% conversion efficiency)� 14) To
substitute � EJ of traditional uses of bioenergy REmap assumes �58 EJ modern
biogas cookstoves, � EJ modern solid biomass cookstoves, and � EJ of biomass
gasification� Based on these fuel demand, total cookstove capacity is calculated
assuming  15% capacity factor and % stove conversion efficiency� Then this total
capacity is divided for each category of cookstove by an average cookstove unit
capacity to arrive at the number of cookstoves shown in the table� 15) Biomass
(total of bagasse and non-bagasse) used for industrial CHP is estimated based on
the total power generation explained in footnote , based on the power-to-heat
ratio assumptions� Total biomass use for industrial process heating is estimated
based on energy allocation of total fuel input to CHPs and the power and heat
output� Biogas and biomass gasification is estimated based on IRENA’
manufacturing industry report� No additional solid biomass use is estimated
beyond the Reference Case that provide process heat for  wide range of process
heat applications in India’ manufacturing industry (covering 12% of India
manufacturing industry’ total fuel demand in REmap 2030)� 16) Model shift is
structural change in the transport sector� Two options are considering:
Electrified city trams instead of personal passenger diesel/petrol automobiles
accounting for around 400 billion passenger kilometres per year (% of road
passenger kilometres); and high speed rail instead of passenger aviation
accounting for around 160 billion passenger kilometres per year (XX share of
passenger domestic flight kilometres)� 17) Reference case based on % blending
requirement by 2030; REmap 2030 based on 15% blending requirements in both
diesel & gasoline� 18) IRENA own estimates of supply based on IRENA (2014) 19)
TFEC growth in the Reference Case is based on the Planning Commission BiG
Scenario for all sectors and energy carriers except biomass (based on an IRENA
assessment) and oil product use in buildings (based on IEA WEO) 20) Power
capacity for rural electrification includes off-grid and mini-grid systems�
Capacity shown here is in addition to capacity in the grid connected categories
above� Electric vehicle assumptions are based on projected annual road passenger
kilometres by 2030 of 10 800 billion� Of this 65% is served by / wheelers, 18%
by  wheel automobiles, and 18% by public bus and mini-bus� For these segments
the REmap options assume  30% penetration of battery electric / wheelers, 20% of
wheel BEV, and 18% of public electric buses� 21) 114
