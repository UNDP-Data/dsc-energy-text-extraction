Indicators of renewable resource potential   Solar PV: Solar resource potential
has been divided into seven classes, each representing  range of annual PV
output per unit of capacity (kWh/kWp/yr) The bar chart shows the proportion of
country' land area in each of these classes and the global distribution of land
area across the classes (for comparison)     Onshore wind: Potential wind power
density (/m2) is shown in the seven classes used by NREL, measured at  height of
100m The bar chart shows the distribution of the country' land area in each of
these classes compared to the global distribution of wind resources Areas in the
third class or above are considered to be  good wind resource   Biomass: Net
primary production (NPP) is the amount of carbon fixed by plants and accumulated
as biomass each year It is  basic measure of biomass productivity The chart
shows the average NPP in the country (tC/ha/yr), compared to the global average
NPP of - tonnes of carbon 10  200  tC/ha/yr  11 = Global average of - tC/ha/yr

SDGs only apply to developing areas Energy self-sufficiency has been defined as
total primary energy production divided by total primary energy supply Energy
trade includes all commodities in Chapter 27 of the Harmonised System (HS)
Capacity utilisation is calculated as annual generation divided by year-end
capacity  ,760h/year Avoided emissions from renewable power is calculated as
renewable generation divided by fossil fuel generation multiplied by reported
emissions from the power sector This assumes that, if renewable power did not
exist, fossil fuels would be used in its place to generate the same amount of
power and using the same mix of fossil fuels In countries and years where no
fossil fuel generation occurs, an average fossil fuel emission factor has been
used to calculate the avoided emissions These profiles have been produced to
provide an overview of developments in renewable energy in different countries
and areas The IRENA statistics team would welcome comments and feedback on its
structure and content, which can be sent to statistics@irenaorg IRENA
