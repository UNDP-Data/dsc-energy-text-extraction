Solar resource potential has been divided into seven classes, each representing
range of annual PV output per unit of capacity (kWh/kWp/yr) The bar chart shows
the proportion of  country' land area in each of these classes and the global
distribution of land area across the classes (for comparison) Onshore wind:
Potential wind power density (/m2) is shown in the seven classes used by NREL,
measured at  height of 100m The bar chart shows the distribution of the country'
land area in each of these classes compared to the global distribution of wind
resources Areas in the third class or above are considered to be  good wind
resource Biomass: Net primary production (NPP) is the amount of carbon fixed by
plants and accumulated as biomass each year It is  basic measure of biomass
productivity The chart shows the average NPP in the country (tC/ha/yr), compared
to the global average NPP of - tonnes of carbon Sources: IRENA statistics, plus
data from the following sources: UN SDG Database (original sources: WHO; World
Bank; IEA; IRENA; and UNSD); UN World Population Prospects; UNSD Energy
Balances; UN COMTRADE; World Bank World Development Indicators; EDGAR; REN21
Global Status Report; IEA -IRENA Joint Policies and Measures Database; IRENA
Global Atlas; and World Bank Global Solar Atlas and Global Wind Atlas Additional
notes: Capacity per capita and public investments SDGs only apply to developing
areas Energy self-sufficiency has been defined as total primary energy
production divided by total primary energy supply Energy trade includes all
commodities in Chapter 27 of the Harmonised System (HS) Capacity utilisation is
calculated as annual generation divided by year-end capacity  ,760h/year Avoided
emissions from renewable power is calculated as renewable generation divided by
fossil fuel generation multiplied by reported emissions from the power sector
This assumes that, if renewable power did not exist, fossil fuels would be used
in its place to generate the same amount of power and using the same mix of
fossil fuels In countries and years where no fossil fuel generation occurs, an
average fossil fuel emission factor has been used to calculate the avoided
emissions These profiles have been produced to provide an overview of
developments in renewable energy in different countries and areas The IRENA
statistics team would welcome comments and feedback on its structure and
content, which can be sent to statistics@irenaorg Last updated on: 8th August,
