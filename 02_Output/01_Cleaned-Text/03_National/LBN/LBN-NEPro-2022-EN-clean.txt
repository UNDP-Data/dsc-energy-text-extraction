Annual generation per unit of installed PV capacity (MWh/kWp) Biomass potential:
net primary production Indicators of renewable resource potential   Solar PV:
Solar resource potential has been divided into seven classes, each representing
range of annual PV output per unit of capacity (kWh/kWp/yr) The bar chart shows
the proportion of  country' land area in each of these classes and the global
distribution of land area across the classes (for comparison)     Onshore wind:
Potential wind power density (/m2) is shown in the seven classes used by NREL,
measured at  height of 100m The bar chart shows the distribution of the country'
land area in each of these classes compared to the global distribution of wind
resources Areas in the third class or above are considered to be  good wind
resource   200 Biomass: Net primary production (NPP) is the amount of carbon
fixed by plants and accumulated as biomass each year It is  basic measure of
biomass productivity The chart shows the average NPP in the country (tC/ha/yr),
compared to the global average NPP of - tonnes of carbon 10   tC/ha/yr  11 =
Global average of - tC/ha/yr Sources: IRENA statistics, plus data from the
following sources: UN SDG Database (original sources: WHO; World Bank; IEA;
IRENA; and UNSD); UN World Population Prospects; UNSD Energy Balances; UN
COMTRADE; World Bank World Development Indicators; EDGAR; REN21 Global Status
Report; IEA -IRENA Joint Policies and Measures Database; IRENA Global Atlas; and
World Bank Global Solar Atlas and Global Wind Atlas Additional notes: Capacity
per capita and public investments SDGs only apply to developing areas Energy
self-sufficiency has been defined as total primary energy production divided by
total primary energy supply Energy trade includes all commodities in Chapter 27
of the Harmonised System (HS) Capacity utilisation is calculated as annual
generation divided by year-end capacity  ,760h/year Avoided emissions from
renewable power is calculated as renewable generation divided by fossil fuel
generation multiplied by reported emissions from the power sector This assumes
that, if renewable power did not exist, fossil fuels would be used in its place
to generate the same amount of power and using the same mix of fossil fuels In
countries and years where no fossil fuel generation occurs, an average fossil
fuel emission factor has been used to calculate the avoided emissions These
profiles have been produced to provide an overview of developments in renewable
energy in different countries and areas The IRENA statistics team would welcome
comments and feedback on its structure and content, which can be sent to
