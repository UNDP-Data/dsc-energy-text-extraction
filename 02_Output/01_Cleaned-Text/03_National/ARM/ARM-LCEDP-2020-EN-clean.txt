This Report presents the modelling framework, data, analyses and conclusions of
the year-long activity undertaken by the Scientific Research Institute for
Energy (SRIE), under sub-contract to Tetra Tech ES Inc as the lead implementing
partner for the USAID Market Liberalization and Energy Trade (MLET) Program, to
prepare an update of the Armenia Least Cost Energy Development Plan (LCEDP) for
the years 2020- This work utilized the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES)
model which is an economic model generator for local, national, multi-regional,
or global energy systems, developed and maintained under the auspices of the
International Energy Agency’ Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program, which
provides  technology-rich basis for representing energy dynamics over  multi-
period time horizon The TIMES model platform provides an integrated energy
system modelling tool designed to guide policy formulation over  wide range of
energy, economic and environmental planning and policy issues, helping to
establish investment priorities within  comprehensive framework Key features of
the TIMES platform include that it encompasses the entire energy system from
resource extraction through to end-use demands; employs least-cost optimization
to identify the most cost-effective pattern of resource use and technology
deployment over time; provides  framework to evaluate medium- to long-term
policies and programs that can impact the evolution of the energy system; and
quantifies the costs and technology choices that result from imposing those
policies and program Thus, the TIMES platform is specifically  tool to develop
and compare scenarios for future energy development and as such can be
productive tool to foster stakeholder buy-in and build consensus around energy
sector policy In order to adapt the generic TIMES model to become the TIMES-
Armenia model, the SRIE team first established as  base year that period for
which there was  complete set of data on production and consumption of all
energy carriers used in Armenia - the energy balance In addition, for the base
year it was necessary to establish the energy production and consumption
technologies in all sectors of the economy and to analyze and subdivide the
initial volumes of energy among all available end-use technologies When work on
the current project was initiated in August 2018, the most recent year for which
all relevant data for the Armenian economy and energy sector were available was
This was selected as the base year Having calibrated the model to confirm that
its 2018 results matched available data, the first stage of the scenario-
building process was to establish the initial Baseline (or Reference) scenario
for the period planning period 2020 – The Baseline Scenario The TIMES-Armenia
modelling exercise started by imposing no constraints on the technology choice
for future energy sector development  key result of this exercise was to
identify that expansion of variable renewable energy sources (VRES), in
particular, solar and wind energy, are the clear least-cost sources for new
generation capacity in Armenia,  clear reflection of the combination of Armenia’
rich solar resource and trends in declining cost of solar power over the
planning period Given that the initial unconstrained level of projected VRES
capacity in the baseline scenario was so high, adding nearly ,000 MW of grid-
connected solar and over ,000 MW of wind power by 2036, it was clear that more
reasonable levels of constrained expansion of VRES generation would be needed
Through expert consultation with stakeholders it was agreed that there was  need
to reflect both potential limitations in the institutional capacity to build so
much new solar and wind in the coming decades – which led to annual build-rate
constraints - and in the need to ensure planning and  | ARMENIA LEAST COST
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  USAIDGOV investment for any system strengthening that
would be required to accommodate higher rates of VRES penetration in the total
generation mix This consultation process established that  reasonable and
ambitious level of constrained maximum VRES capacity to be modelled would be
,500 MW of solar and 500 MW of wind until the end of the planning horizon, along
with limits on the annual build rates When this set of added constraints was
applied to the baseline model, the results established the Baseline Reference
(BASE-) Scenario In this BASE- scenario, which foresees closure of the Armenia
Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP) from 2027 according to current planning - as was
ultimately seen in all other scenarios as well - the full amount of constrained
solar and wind capacity is added, reflecting the significant role of these VRES
as the least-cost source of electricity for Armenia’ development While some
additional hydropower capacity was also added in the BASE- scenario, no other
types of new generation are selected by the model, taking into account that the
gas-fired Yerevan CCGT- TPP has already been included from The total required
funding for new power plant construction in the BASE- scenario is just under $
billion over the entire planning period, while projected expenditures on
imported natural gas fuel for electricity generation are $25 billion The fact
that the full constrained amount of solar and wind capacity is selected by the
model as part of the least cost solution for new generation under all scenarios
underscores the importance to Armenia of ensuring  policy and institutional
environment that supports full realization of new VRES generation to the maximum
extent practicable, not only to ensure the lowest cost generation but also to
minimize reliance on other imported energy sources and to strengthen Armenia’
energy security and competitiveness GDP Growth Sensitivities in the Baseline
Scenario Considering that GDP growth is  key main driver of energy demand
growth, two sensitivity analyses for the BASE- scenario were modelled to explore
the impacts of higher and lower GDP growth rates on the least cost development
pathway of Armenia’ energy system The particular cases analysed were for  50%
higher growth rate (, 75% growth per year) and  50% lower rate (, 25% growth per
year) as compared to the BASE- scenario assumption of  % per annum GDP growth
rate from While these higher (lower) growth rates had the expected impact in
regard to increasing (decreasing) total system costs, total primary energy
supply, final energy consumption and electricity generation, it was especially
interesting to note that the higher GDP growth rate also reduced the share of
total system cost in GDP, owing to the fact that it was accompanied by
significant lowering of the energy intensity of  unit of GDP In fact, the high-
growth case of BASE- projects an even lower level of total primary energy supply
per unit of GDP than the scenario which explicitly pursued reduced final energy
consumption through expanded energy efficiency This enhanced efficiency was most
clearly demonstrated in the fact that while overall GDP increases in total by
27% compared to the BASE- scenario, total system costs increase only by 12% and
total primary energy supply by % This reflects the fact that aggregate purchases
of new energy demand devices increase by almost 19%, which embeds higher levels
of efficiency over time as incomes rise USAIDGOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY
DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  |   surprising but crucial result from these sensitivity
analyses is that the TIMES- Armenia model projects no differences in the
projected total of new power plant capacities in level or by type required to
cover electricity demand over the full range of GDP growth variation While there
are slight variations in the implementation schedule for new solar, wind and
hydro power capacity, the only effect of higher (lower) income growth lies in
the increased (decreased) utilization of existing installed capacity of both
VRES and gas-fired thermal power plants, with  concomitant increase (decrease)
in expenditures on natural gas fuel Nuclear Scenarios Activities to extend the
operational lifetime of the ANPP up to 2027 are already in place and in the
BASE- Scenario the plant was to be decommissioned from that time While available
nuclear technologies included in the TIMES-Armenia model were not selected in
the BASE- Scenario on the basis of least cost, the GOAM remains committed to
policy to maintain some nuclear power in the country’ energy mix To analyze the
cost and other implications of these choices, four alternative scenarios for
continued inclusion of nuclear generation in the Armenian power system were
examined as: operating life extension of the ANPP for an additional  or 10 years
after 2027; and forced implementation of  new nuclear unit, either with
installed capacity 300 MW (Small Modular Reactor) or with installed capacity 600
MW (Light Water Reactor) The scenarios for life extension of the ANPP by  and 10
years decrease total system cost by around %, compared to eth BASE- scenario,
increase total primary energy supply by % and %, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions significantly by % and % and decrease imports of natural gas for
electricity generation by % and %, respectively  key feature of these scenarios
is that they increase total investment costs for new power generation capacity %
and %, compared the BASE- scenario, with the higher investment costs needed for
the longer extension being offset in its impact on total investment by the fact
that in this scenario neither of the mid-sized HPPs (Shnokh and Loriberd) are
built The scenarios which propose new nuclear units to replace the ANPP from
2027 with either  300 MW SMR or  600 MW LWR increase total system cost by around
%, increase primary energy supply by % and %, reduce GHG emissions by % and %,
and decrease imports of natural gas for electricity generation by % and %,
respectively  key impact in these scenarios is that they significantly increase
the required total investment costs for new power generation capacity compared
the BASE- scenario, more than doubling it to $ billion ( 116% increase) for the
300 MW SMR unit and increasing it to over $ billion ( 164% increase) for the 600
MW LWR unit Thus, whether considering total system cost or investment costs
required for new generation, the scenarios for life extension of the ANPP
represent  least-cost policy choice for continuing to maintain nuclear capacity
in Armenia’ energy mix It must be emphasized that such life extensions must
first and foremost always ensure all measures required for the continued safe
and reliable operation of these older plants  | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY
DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  USAIDGOV As  final point, it is useful to note that the
scenarios which imposed GHG emissions reduction targets to meet the level
defined in Armenia’ Nationally Determined Commitment, either by 2036 or earlier,
largely mirror the “new nuclear” scenarios in terms of increases in total system
cost and primary energy supply, reductions in GHG emissions and decreases in
imports of natural gas for electricity generation This is not surprising, given
that in these scenarios, with the constrained amounts of solar and wind VRES
fully utilized, the next choice for lower GHG-emissions generation leads to
selection of the new nuclear technologies, in this case introduction of 600 MW
of nuclear power Given the slightly different implementation patterns for
introduction of nuclear units in these scenarios as compared to the forced
implementation in 2027, the impact on total investment costs for new power
generation capacity is even larger compared to the BASE- scenario, ranging from
$ - $ billion Scenarios with Lower Prices for Imported Natural Gas The BASE-
scenario assumed that the natural gas price will increase up to projected
European levels by 2027 (the year of ANPP decommissioning) and after that
continue to match European levels We also explored two scenarios with lower gas
prices, starting from the same initial border gas price effective from January ,
2019, of US$ 165 per 1000 m3 , which ) applied the EU trend growth rate over the
entire period to 2036 from that starting point , and ii) assumed that the border
gas prices grows to US$ 180 m3 by 2027 and remains fixed at that level until the
end of the planning period These scenarios both show that if Russia continues to
provide relatively low-cost natural gas to Armenia there will be  significant
increase of natural gas consumption across all sectors, but mainly in
electricity generation, transportation and residential heating In both
scenarios, the expanded use of existing gas-fired TPP capacity means that the
mid-sized HPPs (Shnokh and Loriberd) are not built, while no additional thermal
power capacity is required after the inclusion of Yerevan CCGT- (RENCO) and the
closure of Hrazdan TPP This results in  roughly 20% reduction in the lumpsum
investment required for new generation in these scenarios as compared to the
BASE- scenario, the lowest in any scenarios It is useful to note that the
constrained levels of solar and wind generation are still fully built, which
generates an investment cost saving as compared to BASE- of $377 million in the
case with the EU trend to 2036 and of $391 million when the gas price is capped
at $In both scenarios there is an overall increase in total primary energy
supply by  - %, because of increased use of the cheaper imported natural gas
which is accompanied by  reduction in use of VRES While total energy system cost
is reduced when gas prices are lower, it is important to note that the increased
utilization of cheaper gas maintains and deepens Armenia’ dependence on imported
energy USAIDGOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  |  Scenarios to
Promote Fuel Switching to Electricity in Transport and Heating The most consumed
fuel source in Armenia is and will continue to be imported natural gas, most of
which is used for residential heating and transport Since increased electricity
generation based on development of Armenia’ VRES is indicated as  least cost
solution in the BASE- scenario, and confirmed in all other scenarios, expanding
use of these domestic energy resources could be accompanied by implementation of
policies to stimulate use of electricity in the transport and residential
sectors to replace natural gas imports To explore these opportunities, we
examined scenarios designed to increase the penetration level for use of
electricity in residential heating to 25% in 2027 and to 50% by 2036, increase
the penetration level for use of electric vehicles to 25% in 2027 and to 50% by
2036 and both of these scenarios taken together Each of these scenarios
proposing increased sectoral electricity penetration separately reduces total
system cost (in combination by %), reduces total primary energy supply (again,
in combination by %), lowers GHG emissions (by nearly %, in combination) and
decreases imports of natural gas for electricity generation (in combination by
%) Most importantly, no change in the overall level and type of new generation
is required as compared to the BASE- scenario in order to achieve these results,
with only  negligible increase in lumpsum investment costs for new generation
capacity associated with slight variations in the implementation schedule for
projected additions of solar and wind power The reduction in natural gas used
for electricity generation shows clearly that  policy to promote increased
deployment of electric for heating and electric vehicles will expand utilization
of domestic VRES, reduce reliance on imported energy sources and strengthen

USAIDGOV  REPORT OVERVIEW AND DESCRIPTION OF THE ARMENIAN ENERGY SYSTEM IN THE
MODELLING BASE YEAR 2016  REPORT OVERVIEW This Report presents the modelling
framework, data, analyses and conclusions of the year-long activity undertaken
by the Scientific Research Institute for Energy (SRIE), under sub-contract to
Tetra Tech ES Inc as the lead implementing partner for the USAID Market
Liberalization and Energy Trade (MLET) Program, to prepare an update of the
Armenia Least Cost Energy Development Plan (LCEDP) for the years 2020-In order
to adapt the generic TIMES model (see Chapter ) so as to become the TIMES-
Armenia model, it was necessary first to establish  base year (, the first
modelling year) for that period for which  complete set of data on production
and consumption of all energy carriers used in the country - the energy balance
- can be detailed In addition, for the base year it is necessary to establish
the energy production and consumption technologies in all sectors of the
economy, and to analyze and subdivide the initial volumes of used energy among
all available end-use technologies When work on the current project was
initiated in August 2018, the most recent year for which all relevant data for
the Armenian economy and energy sector were available was 2016, so this year was
selected as the base year For all projections, dollar costs and expenditures are
reported in terms of 2016 dollars The remaining sections of this Chapter
summarize  description of the Armenian energy system in the modelling base year
of Chapter  presents  brief summary of the platform and methodology for the
generic TIMES model, which is an economic model generator for local, national,
multi-regional, or global energy systems, developed and maintained under the
auspices of the International Energy Agency’ Energy Technology Systems Analysis
Program (IEA - ETSAP) This model provides  technology-rich basis for
representing energy dynamics over  multi-period time horizon Chapter  provides
details on the specific application of the TIMES-Armenia model, confirming the
calibration of the model to the year first modelled year (2018), confirming
results to match available data, and presents the process of developing the
initial Baseline (or Reference) scenario for the period planning period 2020 –
With the Baseline-Reference scenario fully detailed, Chapter  outlines  set of
selected alternative possible scenarios that were identified by key stakeholders
as of interest, to reflect different potential pathways for the evolution of the
Armenian energy system, including policy choices as well as sensitivity analyses
to determine the possible impacts of variations in such factors as demand growth
or energy processes This set of scenarios is intended to be illustrative and not
exhaustive and to provide useful inputs to policy and strategy development for
the energy sector in Armenia over the period to Once the results of the various
scenarios have been described and the differences in outcomes explored, Chapter
presents  set of summary conclusions and recommendations based on those results
Detailed information on various aspects of the model and data used is presented
in the Appendices  ARMENIAN ELECTRICITY GENERATION, TRANSMISSION AND CONSUMPTION
IN 2016 As summarized in Table , the total installed electricity generation
capacity of the power system of Armenia in 2016 was approximately ,267 MW, of
which ,710 MW was available, due to the conditions of aging of some plant and
equipment, as well as of climate circumstances of the nuclear and thermal power
plants USAIDGOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  |  locations1 The

Plant (ANPP) was put into operation in 1976 and the second unit in Two reactors
of the type VVER-440 (-270) were installed, with an aggregate capacity of 815 MW
Following the Spitak earthquake on December , 1988, operation of the ANPP
stopped for safety considerations, although there was no technical damage to the
plant As  consequence of the severe energy crisis in Armenia during the years ,
the ANPP Unit No  was re-commissioned in 1995 with an installed capacity of 440
MW In 2016, the available capacity of ANPP was 385 MW The installed capacity of
all hydropower plants (HPPs) in Armenia in 2016 was ,293 MW, including 328 MW of
small HPPs (size less than 30 MW) All the rivers of Armenia are in the Kura-
Araks Basin, with % of the territory of Armenia in the Araks river basin There
are more than 200 rivers and streams in Armenia with  length of 10 km or more
The Hrazdan River, flowing out of Lake Sevan, and the Araks, Vorotan, and Debet
Rivers have the most energy potential According to the former Ministry of Energy
Infrastructures and Natural Resources, the potential water energy resources of
Armenia are billion kWh, including billion kWh from large and medium-sized
rivers, and  billion kWh from small rivers Armenia’ hydropower resources are the
country’ most widely used renewable energy resource The main hydropower
generation units in Armenia in 2016 were:  Sevan-Hrazdan HPP Cascade: The
cascade comprises seven HPPs: Sevan (34 MW); Hrazdan (81 MW); Argel (224 MW);
Arzni (70 MW); Kanaker (102 MW); Yerevan- (44 MW); and Yerevan- ( MW), with
total installed capacity of 560 MW and designed to produce up to 32 billion kWh
annually The HPPs are all located on the Hrazdan River and use irrigation water
flow from Lake Sevan and other tributaries of the Hrazdan River  Vorotan HPP
Cascade: The cascade consists of three HPPs, all located on the Vorotan River in
the territory of Syunik, which utilize both the river and stream waters The
cascade comprises Spandaryan HPP (76 MW), Shamb HPP (171 MW) and Tatev HPP (157
MW) with  total installed capacity of 404 MW and  designed annual electricity
generation of 16 billion kWh  The main reasons for lower availability of nuclear
and thermal power plants against installed capacities relate to the relatively
low atmospheric density resulting by the altitude above sea level and dry and
hot summers in Armenia, which have an influence on efficiency of these types of
power plants 10 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  USAIDGOV  Small
HPPs: Construction of small HPPs in Armenia has been  leading factor in the
development of renewable energy resources, enhancing the energy security of
Armenia The majority of small HPPs under construction or in operation are run-
of-river facilities designed for natural water flows As of January , 2017,
electricity was generated by 173 small HPPs, with total 328 MW installed
capacity In 2016, the generation from small HPPs was around 937 million kWh,
roughly 13% of total generation In terms of other renewable energy resources, in
2016 Armenia’ system also had one wind farm with  capacity of 64 MW and at the
end of the year there were  small number of solar PV plants installed, with
capacity of 273 kW and annual generation less than  million kWh Data on
aggregate electricity generation and consumption in 2016 are presented in Table
It should be noted that total technical losses in the electricity grid,
including transmission and distribution networks, was just over around 10% There
was also electricity trade both to north and to south TABLE : ELECTRICITY

the total length of 220 kV and 110 kV High Voltage Lines (HVL) involved in
electricity transmission was around ,740 km (,323 km of 220 kV HVL and 417 km of
110 kV HVL) and the number of substations was 33 (15 220 kV substations and 18
110 kV substations) The Armenia power system has interconnections with all
neighbor countries, although those with Turkey and Azerbaijan were not in
operation, due to political issues Currently, construction of new 400 kV HVL
both toward the North and the South is planned, which will expand opportunities
both for exchange to neighboring power systems and to establish electricity
transit among them Electricity generated by power plants and transmitted by HVL
reaches consumers through the distribution network, which comprises 110 – 35 -
(10) -  kV lines and cables The number of distribution customers in 2016 was
close to 985,000, all served by the sole distribution company “Electric Networks

substations at the 110 kV level; ,307 km of overhead and 68 km of cable lines
and 224 substations at the 35 kV level; and 20,917 km of overhead and ,666 km of

GAS IMPORTS, SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION IN 2016 Data for the main indicators of the
natural gas supply system for 2016 are summarized in Table  below The overall
gasification level in Armenia at 95% is nearly complete; this means that almost
all consumers have access to the gas system Notwithstanding this fact, many
people especially in rural communities still use biomass (wood and/or manure)
for heating, cooking and hot water The underground gas storage facility in
Abovyan, which has capacity of around 140 million cubic meters (m3), provides an
opportunity to regulate daily load fluctuations in heavy demand periods such as
winter days, as well as to accumulate some amount of gas to provide
uninterrupted supply in emergency situations Finally, it should be noted that
gas imports from Russia are used for all domestic needs (including electricity
generation), while gas imports from the south are primarily used for electricity
generation in the context of the swap contract TABLE : MAIN INDICATORS OF

model is  tool for optimizing all fuel and energy flows in  system, including
production, transformation and consumption, it is necessary to analyze and
incorporate all relevant data into the model The best way to do this is to use
the internationally approved country energy balance This section presents the
main data of the Armenian Energy Balance for the base year (2016), as officially
published by International Energy Agency (IEA) (Source:
ource&mode=table&dataTable=BALANCES) Table  presents the Armenian Energy Balance
for 2016, which includes also the amounts of other energy carriers used, in
particular coal and oil As with gas, practically all coal and oil products are
imported from abroad (see Table ) The cumulative share of those coal and oil
products in Armenia’ Energy Balance is less than 10% and they do not play
significant role in the country’ economy Almost three-quarters of oil products
are used in transport, not only as fuel but also as lubricants According to the
IEA “World energy balances, 2018 edition, Database documentation” ( these flows
are defined as follows:  Total primary energy supply (TPES) is made up of
production + imports - exports - international marine bunkers - international
aviation bunkers ± stock changes  Transformation processes comprise the
conversion of primary forms of energy to secondary and further transformation (,
coking coal to coke; crude oil to oil products; fuel oil to electricity) Inputs
to transformation processes are shown as negative numbers and output from the
process is shown as  positive number Transformation losses will appear in the
“total” column as negative numbers  Energy industry own use covers the amount
of fuels used by the energy producing industries (, for heating, lighting and
operation of all equipment used in the extraction process; for traction and for
16 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  USAIDGOV distribution) It
includes energy consumed by energy industries for heating, pumping, traction and
lighting purposes  Total Final Consumption (TFC) Is the sum of the consumption
in end-use sectors and for non- energy use Energy used for transformation
processes and for own use of the energy producing industries is excluded Final
consumption reflects for the most part deliveries to consumers Note that
international aviation bunkers and international marine bunkers are not included
in final consumption except for the world total, where they are reported as
world aviation bunkers and world marine bunkers in transport  Non-energy use
covers those fuels that are used as raw materials in the different sectors and
are not consumed as  fuel or transformed into another fuel Non-energy use is
shown separately in final consumption under the heading non-energy use Note that
for biofuels, only the amounts specifically used for energy purposes ( small

suited to explore how developing scenarios on energy efficiency policy and
adoption can play  role in Armenia’ economy, creating conditions for economic
growth while improving energy security By reducing the energy intensity of
economic output, energy efficiency is  key element in realizing  safe,
sustainable and affordable energy supply, while meeting increasing energy demand
and improving quality of life Under existing conditions of extreme import
dependence for fossil fuels, energy that Armenia’ citizens, businesses, and
infrastructure do not use is one of the cheapest, cleanest, and most secure
energy resources Government of Armenia policy is to promote energy efficiency in
all economic sectors according to definitions formulated in the Law on Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy (2004), and as articulated in the National
Program on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (2007), the Action Plan of
Armenian Government for Implementation of National Program on Energy Efficiency
and Renewable Energy (2010), the President’ Order on Approval of Armenian Energy
Security Concept (2013), the Energy Security Action Plan for  (2014) and the
Long-Term (up to 2036) Development Pathways of the Armenian Energy Sector (2015)
Further, on February , 2017, Government of Armenia (GOAM) approved the Energy
Efficiency Action Plan for 2017-In 2016 amendments to Law on Energy Efficiency
and Renewable Energy were approved by Parliament which included some specific
minimum energy efficiency requirements The amended Law in particular requested
the Government to classify economic sectors by their energy intensity levels as
high, medium and low and established mandatory energy efficiency and energy

LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  | 23 The potential for energy efficiency in
all sectors has been assessed repeatedly3,,,, and remains high, despite the
relatively low energy intensity of the economy Although the GOAM has adopted
laws and policies to promote efficiency through various programs as noted, the
potential for efficiency improvement remains largely untapped As energy prices
rise, the urgency of accelerating uptake of energy efficiency throughout
Armenia’ economy has increased Nevertheless, up to 2016 obligatory measures to
increase energy efficiency and/or to reduce energy consumption levels had not
been implemented, so that it was possible to model for the base year only the
“Autonomous efficiency improvement” (AEI) factors, which have been introduced as
follows:  for Transport – 75%/year,  for Agriculture and Commercial – %,  for
Industry – %, and  for Residential – 01% These factors show the percentage of
efficiency improvement due to replacement of old equipment and devices by new
ones of the same type, taking into consideration some reduction of efficiency of
old equipment because of depreciation The AEI factor is in force for the whole
planning period  THE INTEGRATED MARKAL - EFOM SYSTEM (TIMES) MODEL PLATFORM AND
METHODOLOGY  THE GENERIC TIMES MODEL PLATFORM The TIMES model platform,  set of
tools developed and maintained under the auspices of the IEA - ETSAP, is an
economic model generator for local, national, multi-regional, or global energy
systems, which provides  technology-rich basis for representing energy dynamics
over  multi-period time horizon The model is usually applied to the analysis of
the entire energy sector, but it may also be applied to study single sectors,
such as electricity and district heating The TIMES platform provides an
integrated energy systems’ modelling framework that is designed to guide policy
formulation over  wide range of energy, economic and environmental planning and
policy issues and to help establish investment priorities within  comprehensive
framework Key aspects of TIMES platform include that it: ) encompasses an entire
energy system from resource extraction through to end-use demands, as

Simplified Generic Reference Energy System In adapting the generic TIMES model
to  specific country use case, estimates of end-use energy service demands (,
car road travel; residential lighting; steam heat requirements in the paper
industry; etc) are provided by the user to drive the reference scenario In
addition, the user provides estimates of the existing stocks of energy-related
equipment in all sectors and identifies assumptions relating to the
characteristics of available future technologies and present and future sources
of primary energy supply and their potentials Using these as inputs, the TIMES
model carries out its optimization to supply energy services at minimum global
cost by simultaneously making decisions on equipment investment and operation;
primary energy supply; and energy trade For example, if there is an increase in
residential lighting energy service relative to the reference scenario (perhaps
due to  decline in the cost of residential lighting, or due to different
assumptions on GDP growth), either existing generation equipment must be used
more intensively, or new, possibly more efficient equipment must be installed
The choice by the model of the generation equipment (type and fuel) is based on
the analysis of the characteristics of alternative generation technologies, on
the economics of energy supply, and on environmental criteria As shown in Figure
, the TIMES model platform is  vertically integrated model of the entire
extended energy system USAIDGOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  |
25 Figure  Energy System Models: Technology-Rich Representation Finally, it
should be noted that in TIMES, as in its MARKAL model forerunner, the quantities
and prices of the various commodities are assumed to be in equilibrium,  prices
and quantities in each time period are such that suppliers produce exactly the
quantities demanded by consumers Thus, this equilibrium has the property that
total economic surplus is maximized  DRIVING THE TIMES MODEL VIA SCENARIOS The
TIMES model is particularly suited to explore possible energy futures based on
contrasted scenarios Given the long time-horizons that are typically simulated
with the model, the scenario approach is the most effective choice (whereas for
shorter time periods econometric methods may provide more useful projections)
scenario consists of  set of coherent assumptions about the future trajectories
of the main drivers of the energy system, leading to  coherent organization of
the system under study In the TIMES platform,  complete scenario consists of
four types of inputs: energy service demand curves, primary resource supply
curves,  policy setting, and descriptions of  complete set of existing and
available future technologies  THE DEMAND COMPONENT OF  TIMES SCENARIO In the
case of  country-specific version of the TIMES model, the main drivers are:
Population, GDP, GDP per capita, number of households, and sectoral outputs Once
the drivers for  TIMES model are determined and 26 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY
DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  USAIDGOV quantified the construction of the reference demand
scenario requires computation of  set of energy service demands over the
relevant planning time horizon This is done by choosing and applying
elasticities of demand to their respective drivers As noted earlier, the demands
are user-provided for the reference scenario only When the model is run for
alternate scenarios (, an emission constrained case, or  set of alternate
technological assumptions), it is likely that the demands will be affected The
TIMES model has the capability of estimating the response of demands to the
changing conditions of an alternate scenario To do this, the model requires an
additional set of inputs for the assumed own-price elasticities of the demand In
this case, the TIMES model is then able to adjust the demands endogenously to
the alternate cases without exogenous intervention; that is, the TIMES model is
driven not by demands but by demand curves  THE SUPPLY COMPONENT OF  TIMES
SCENARIO The second constituent of  TIMES model scenario is  set of supply
curves for primary energy and material resources Multi-stepped supply curves are
easily modeled in TIMES, each step representing  certain potential of the
resource available at  particular cost In some cases, the potential may be
expressed as  cumulative potential over the model horizon ( reserves of gas,
crude oil, etc), as  cumulative potential over the resource base ( available
areas for wind converters differentiated by velocities, available farmland for
bio- crops, roof areas for PV installations) and in others as an annual
potential ( maximum extraction rates, or for renewable resources the available
wind, biomass, or hydro potentials) Note that the supply component also includes
the identification of trading possibilities, where the amounts and prices of the
traded commodities are determined either endogenously or within user-imposed
limits  THE POLICY COMPONENT OF  TIMES SCENARIO Insofar as some policies impact
the energy system, they become an integral part of scenario definition For
instance,  reference scenario may ignore emissions of various pollutants, while
alternate policy scenarios may enforce emission restrictions, or emission taxes,
etc The detailed technological nature of the TIMES model allows for simulation
of  wide variety of both micro measures ( technology portfolios, or targeted
subsidies to groups of technologies) and broader policy targets (such as
general carbon tax or permit trading system on air contaminants)  simpler
example might be  nuclear policy that limits or expands the future capacity of
nuclear plants Another example might be the imposition of fuel taxes, or of
targeted capital subsidies, etc  THE TECHNO-ECONOMIC COMPONENT OF  TIMES
SCENARIO The fourth constituent of  TIMES model scenario is the set of technical
and economic parameters assumed for the transformation of primary resources into
energy services In the TIMES model, these techno-economic parameters are
described in the form of technologies (or processes) that transform some
commodities into others (fuels, materials, energy services, emissions) In the
TIMES model, some technologies may be user imposed, while others may simply be
available for the model to choose from The quality of  TIMES model rests on
rich, well-developed set of technologies, both current and future, for the model
to choose from This emphasis on the technological database is one of the main
distinguishing factors of the class of bottom-up models to which TIMES belongs
Other classes of models will tend to emphasize other aspects of the system (
interactions with the rest of the economy) and may treat the technical system in
more succinct manner, , via aggregate production functions  THE TIMES-ARMENIA

gasoline, US$ 987/; diesel, US$ 049/; kerosene, US$ 437/, aviation gasoline, US$
261/; and jet fuel, US$ 163/ Nuclear fuel prices for modelled nuclear power
plants are taken the same based on the special study results provided by the
Ukrainian National Nuclear Electricity Generation Company Energoatom9 Finally,
accounting for the current electricity-for-natural gas swap contract is
critical assumption The swap contract calls for imports of gas from the South at
no direct cost, but in exchange for electricity exports at  rate of  m3 of gas =
kWh of electricity It is assumed that both the swap contract and net imports
from Georgia are held constant at their 2018 levels through the end of the
planning period (2036); , net exports to South will amount to 52 TWh per annum,
and net imports from Georgia will be GWh   DEMAND PROJECTIONS FOR USEFUL ENERGY
Demand projections in the TIMES model are developed for useful energy services;
, lighting, cooling, heating, food preparation, transportation of people and
goods, etc10 The fundamental TIMES model requirement is to meet projected levels
of useful energy demand in all sectors and sub-sectors, choosing those fuels and
technologies that do so at minimum costs for the total system Useful energy
demand is related to GDP or demographic parameters via elasticities These
elasticities represent how much useful energy growth depends on the growth in
GDP, or in GDP per capita Elasticities vary for different sectors and end-use
applications and they have been analyzed from historical data available in the
Yearbooks of the Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia and estimated
using expert judgment As the economy grows, the overall demand for energy will
increase Based on analyses of available retrospective statistical data and
assumptions of the working team, end-use energy forecasts by sector were
prepared The structure of projected useful energy demand and its growth for 2018
– 2036 is shown in Table  and illustrated in Figure  TABLE : STRUCTURE AND

Figure  Growth of Sector Useful Energy Demands (2018 – 2036) The Residential
sector accounts for the biggest share of useful energy demand in overall energy
up to 2036, following by the Commercial sector, which in the last planning years
is slightly less than the share of Residential (around 40% each) Agriculture
accounts for less than % of useful energy demand, with Industry accounting for
the remainder It should be noted that all economic sectors increase in terms of
their value of energy demand, with average annual growth rates ranging from % to
% The main demand drivers of demand growth for the Agriculture, Commercial,
Industry and Freight transport sectors are GDP and sector elasticity to GDP
growth For the Residential and Passenger transportation sectors, the main
drivers are GDP per capita and sector elasticity to GDP per capita growth In
addition, sector specific demand drivers were also applied, , degree-days (for
heating and cooling) in the Commercial sector, and Population and Changes in the
number of new and existing houses for the Residential sector The values of
various elasticities have been established based on the general tends and expert
opinion in working team decisions In addition, the main sector-specific
assumptions influencing projected growth of useful energy demand can be
summarized as:  Agriculture: The small growth rate is expected due to low
possibilities to expand agriculture For this sector, the elasticity was taken as
for all demand types and for the entire planning period, as the result of low
demand growth for electricity used for water pumping and tractors  Commercial:
It is assumed that development of the Commercial (Service) sector will be based
on broad development of hotels, restaurants, shops, etc This is expected to
result in relatively high growth of demand for space cooling and heating,
lighting, cooking, etc For this sector, the elasticity has taken as  for all
demand types (space cooling, space heating, cocking, lighting, hot water and
other appliances) and for the entire planning period  Industry: It is assumed
that the demand growth will be mainly driven by the Food & Tobacco sub-sector
and by development of the non-metallic minerals sub-sector The elasticity for
these sectors has been taken as  for the entire planning period This assumption
was made based on the analysis of available Armenian energy balances for recent
years and on industry data as presented in the Yearbooks of the Armenian
Statistical Committee ( 32 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
USAIDGOV  Residential: Due to the projected slight decrease in population, the
main demand driver, , GDP per capita, still grows In terms of the TIMES
modelling logic, this means that living conditions will improve, which allows
the population the possibility to buy more appliances, in addition to existing
ones More space in homes and apartments will be heated (,  country-specific
issue today is heating of part of flats/homes) Also, the number of people per
household is projected to reduce, which means that the number of apartments
would increase and more energy will be needed for space heating and cooling,
lighting, etc The model also includes other drivers which will lead to reduced
energy consumption, such as the demolition rate of old buildings and replacement
with more energy efficient new buildings, and internal improvement of
appliances’ efficiency, even when replacing the same one All of these drivers
are captured in the model and the results show that on net, consumption will
increase Two elasticities have been defined for Residential sector: That for
space heating, space cooling, hot water preparation is assumed at ; and that for
cooking and other appliances at   Transport: It is assumed that the growth of
the population’ standard of living, combined with Commercial sector development
will require more differentiated types of passenger and freight vehicles, which
will result in growth of Transportation end use energy demand Sector
elasticities for buses are distributed through the planning period, dropping
from  in 2018 to 25 in For passenger carrying international aviation, the
elasticity is kept constant at For heavy-duty vehicles, cargo international
aviation, and commercial trucks the elasticities will decrease from  to For rail
passenger transportation the sector elasticity is set at 64, and for freight
rail transportation at   EXISTING ELECTRICITY GENERATION FACILITIES Table

PARAMETERS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY One of the advantages of the TIMES modelling
tool is its ability to simulate and optimize demand-side consumption For the
Initial Unconstrained Baseline (IU BASE) Scenario, no one activity is forced and
the tool itself chooses the most economically attractive demand technologies to
be implemented in the system The model contains an extensive database with
different types of demand technologies, presented as “Standard”, “Improved”,
“Best” and “Advanced” The main parameters describing each technology are cost,
efficiency and the initial year within the planning horizon when such technology
could be available, as well as fuel type used Depending on the whole system cost
calculated for each milestone period, as well as for entire planning horizon,
and based on the costs for supplied energy carriers, the TIMES model chooses the
least cost demand 11 12 13 14 15 16 Update to the Economic and Financial

BASE scenario, the rate of penetration of Improved/Better/Advanced devices is
limited to % by the end of the planning horizon Because the Government of
Armenia has not yet put in place any obligatory requirements for implementation
of energy efficiency activities, the market uptake of Improved, Better and
Advanced technologies is constrained The common assumption on the upper limit of
“Improved” technologies for Agriculture, Commercial, Industry and Residential
sectors is 10% In addition, the Agriculture sector is allowed to change existing
technologies by “Best” (10%) and “Advanced” (10%), the Commercial sector by
“Advanced” (%), and the Residential sector by “Best” (%) and “Advanced” (%) For
the Industrial sector neither “Best” nor “Advanced” technologies are allowed,
while for the Transport sector, implementation of all new technologies types are
limited to 10%, based on the relatively limited retrospective data available for
Armenia, combined with expert review and judgement of available experience by
the DWG and SRIE team  MAIN ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE INITIAL UNCONSTRAINED BASELINE
SCENARIO Summarizing the key model assumptions as detailed in the sections
above, we note in particular:  GDP growth is assumed constant after 2022, at
the level of % per year (sensitivities to higher or lower rates will be examined
in subsequent scenarios);  While population is assumed to have  small negative
growth rate, thus slightly decreasing over the planning period, residential
demand for useful energy still grows on average by % annually;  The commercial
sector is the main contributor to demand for useful energy, with average annual
growth of over %;  The agriculture and industrial sectors contribute less to
the growth of demand for useful energy, with average annual growth rates of
around % and %, respectively;  The gas price is assumed to increase, reaching
the European prices level in 2027 (US$ 299 m3) and growing at the same rate
thereafter;  Electricity losses are assumed to maintain  total of % for
transmission and distribution systems;  Net electricity exports to South are
held constant at the 2018 level (,GWh) for the planning horizon; net electricity
imports from Georgia and from Artsakhenergo are assumed to remain unchanged at
their 2018 levels, GWh and GWh respectively, for the planning horizon;  Both
the Yerevan CCGT2 (RENCO) thermal plant and the Masrik- grid connected solar PV
plant, which are already financed and have set Commercial Operation Dates are
introduced in the system at those dates; and  No other technical limitations
are imposed on the introduction of new power generation candidate technologies
in the system for the planning horizon  SUMMARY RESULTS OF INITIAL UNCONSTRAINED
BASELINE SCENARIO The following discussion summarizes the main findings of the
TIMES-Armenia initial model Baseline Scenario calculation results, in which no
further constraints than those noted above have been introduced It is useful to
reiterate that the purpose of this exercise is to provide  starting point and
framework for further analysis, focused on the sole criterion of least cost
entry of new generation in the system to ensure that projected demand is met
Based on the results of this scenario, further adjustments may be made before
examining  series of practical scenarios and sensitivities that will be
developed in order to provide inputs for policy and planning considerations for
Armenia’ energy sector Starting with the projection of main energy sources over
the planning time horizon, presented in Table , we see that natural gas remains
by far the dominant source, with its share in Total Primary Energy Supply
(TPES), 36 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  USAIDGOV staying at
around 58% in the period following the exit from the system of the ANPP in 2027,
having declined to just under 50% in the period around Nuclear energy remains
significant supply source, accounting for up to 25% of TPES, until the ANPP
exits from the system Renewable energy sources increase dramatically over the
planning period, rising from around % of TPES to 24% The share of oil products
in TPES rises slightly from 10% to 12 % over the planning period TABLE : TOTAL

whether the capacities of existing gas pipelines might cause possible gas supply

be seen, the main energy source consumed for the Agriculture sector, which
accounts for less than % of total FEC, is oil products, remaining around 77%
throughout the planning period For the Commercial sector, whose share of total
FEC rises from 16% to over 20% over the planning period, the main sources of
energy consumed are natural gas and electricity; the former covering 57% and the
latter 42% of sectoral demand respectively, with  slight shift over the planning
period from gas to electricity In the Industry sector, whose share of total FEC
rises very slightly from just under 15% to just over 16% over the planning
period, the main sources of energy consumed are again natural gas and
electricity; the former accounting for 50% and the latter 43% of sector demand
respectively, here with  slight shift over the planning period from electricity
to gas The main sources of final energy consumption in the Residential sector
are natural gas, electricity, and biofuels, accounting for around 63%, 19% and
18%, respectively, with very slight shifts over the planning period away from
gas and biofuels and toward electricity Finally, in the Transport sector, FEC is
almost entirely split between natural gas USAIDGOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY

configuration of the power sector as determined by the TIMES-Armenia model is
presented in Table , showing the Initial Unconstrained Baseline Scenario for
total installed capacity in each period, in MW In addition to existing
generation units, this scenario includes the introduction of the RENCO gas-fired
CCGT and the Masrik- solar PV power plants according to their scheduled
Commercial Operation Dates, and also forces the decommissioning of the ANPP and
Hrazdan TPP at the end of their current operational lifetimes, 2027 and 2021,
respectively In this Least-Cost Baseline, with no other limitations on choice of
technology, by the end of planning period the model results show an added
capacity of ,931 MW of grid-connected Solar PV, ,091 MW of Wind Farms and 107 MW
of added Small HPPs The quantity of electricity generation by each technology or
plant (in GWh) over the planning period is presented in Table These results show
clearly that, taken from  cost perspective only and leaving aside any other
possible technical constraints, extensive implementation of grid-connected solar
PVs along with wind farms (Variable Renewable Energy Sources – VRES) are
economically the most attractive sources of new electricity generation over the
period to As  practical matter, planning for and realizing such extensive growth
of VRES could clearly create operational challenges for the electricity system
As large amounts of new grid connected VRESs are introduced, the model shows
decline in production of Small HPPs, which are almost exclusively run-of- river
This is driven in part by the fact of maximum solar generation during summer
time (especially in June), when large amounts of hydro generation are also
available, although the model limits generation by these Small HPPs at these
times as higher cost In the winter, when power system peak is in the evening and
solar is not producing, the compensating generation cannot be from Small HPPs
but is rather met by operation at full capacities of the RENCO and Yerevan CCGT
plants Given system operational constraints of having such large amounts of VRES
on the system from solar PV, this could imply the need for implementation of
storage technologies, although these are available and are not among the
selected least-cost solutions Another possible approach to overcome potential
system stability problems would be to limit annual construction of grid-
connected solar PV plants In fact, we explore this in the next case, which
describes our proposed Baseline - Reference Scenario 40 | ARMENIA LEAST COST

of new power capacities to cover the gap of electricity production, which is
added from wind farms as the lowest cost technology at that time with average
annual capacity factor (31) suitable to cover about 340  of the lost base load

LIMITATION OF VRES Results of the Initial Unconstrained Baseline (IU BASE)
Scenario clearly highlighted the cost-based preference for significant
implementation of grid-connected wind and solar PV generation At the same time,
such  substantial expansion also raises questions of the required further
analysis of system technical issues associated with adding very large amounts of
VRES, , system stability and dispatching issues, as well as of ensuring
realistic time frames for development of those resources and the availability of
domestic capacity to do so at such large scale While these issues suggest that
it could be reasonable to look at more limited expansion of VRES, there are also
significant benefits for domestic energy security that would arise from
displacing imported gas or nuclear fuels with VRES and which in turn would
suggest that renewable generation expansion should be promoted as much as
practically possible To reflect these aspects of concern, the following
scenario, which we develop as the Baseline-Reference Scenario (BASE-), imposes
certain limitation on grid-connected solar PV and wind generation expansion In
particular, the following sections develop the BASE- Scenario in which total
VRES development is capped at ,000 MW, of which grid-connected solar PV can be
at maximum ,500 MW over the planning period and wind generation at 500 MW Based
on wide discussion with Armenian solar experts it was assumed that construction
capacities would be limited to around 100 MW per annum, which would imply around
,600 MW over the planning horizon 16 years As  practical matter, based on
current construction tendencies it was decided to impose the limit at ,500 MW
over the planning horizon Once we have compared this BASE- Scenario to the IU
BASE Scenario presented in the previous section, in Chapter  we will then
proceed to use the BASE- Scenario as the point of comparison for examining
further the alternate policy scenarios that have been identified by key sector
stakeholders as of interest in looking to reshape the evolution of the Armenian
energy system  MAIN ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE BASELINE-REFERENCE (BASE-) SCENARIO The
BASE- Scenario maintains the same assumptions regarding key demand drivers and
hence the same projected growth of sectoral demands for useful energy as in the
IU BASE Scenario (Section  above); it also 42 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY
DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  USAIDGOV retains the same assumptions related to gas prices,
electricity losses, net exports, energy efficiency adoption rates and inclusion
of Yerevan CCGT2 and Masrik- In addition, the BASE- Scenario introduces the
following assumptions related to limiting VRES deployment over the period from :
 Introduction of new VRES generation capacity is limited to  GW for solar PV
(central and decentralized) and  GW of wind  Annual maximum new capacity
additions are capped at 100 MW for central solar PV, / MW for
Residential/Commercial rooftop PV, and 50 MW for wind  No other technical
limitations are imposed on the introduction of new power generation candidate
technologies in the system for the planning horizon  SUMMARY OF BASE- SCENARIO
RESULTS Starting again with the projection of main energy sources over the
planning time horizon, Table 11 shows that natural gas remains by far the
dominant source, with its share in TPES at around 68% in the period following
the exit from the system of the ANPP in 2027, having declined to 50% prior to
that period In fact, compared to the IU BASE Scenario, gas increases its share
of TPES by about 10% after 2027 and its amount by around 25% as  result of
limiting VRES builds In the BASE- Scenario, RES increases around two and  half
times over the planning period, with its share rising from % of TPES to nearly
16% by 2030, as the new generation reaches its assumption-allowed limits No
other sources of primary energy supply show significant changes from the IU BASE

quantity of electricity generation by each technology or plant, in GWh, over the
planning period is presented in Table As the limited amounts of new VRES are
introduced, the model shows relatively stable generation by most of the other
power plants Only generation at RENCO CCGT declines slightly between 2020 and
2024, while generation of Hrazdan  TPP is needed only in  relatively small
amount at the end of planning period Figures  and  show the pattern of new
generation added to the system by type and the associated total lumpsum
projected investment expenditures over the planning period, which amounts to
roughly US $89 billion for ,457 MW of added capacity In the period of
decommissioning the ANPP in 2027, the model indicates the power system should
add around 540 MW of new power capacity to cover the gap of electricity
generation, which is added from the lowest cost technologies at that time -
Solar PV (300 MW), wind farm (150 MW) and medium-sized Shnokh HPP (75 MW) During
the last three planning periods to 2036, an additional 875 MW of generation
capacity is added to cover the growth of demand; again, this comprises new VRES

generation from VRES reduces the overall total (undiscounted) lumpsum level of
investment in new generation by 40%, from US$,170 million to US$ ,891, which is
the combined result of the much-reduced level of solar PV and wind investment,
offset partly by the increased HPP investments and higher utilization of the
existing gas-fired thermal generation Thus, the reduced new generation
investment funding need of US$ ,279 million is also associated with
significantly higher fuel expenditures As the limited implementation of VRES
results in additional natural gas demand of roughly % relative to IU BASE by
2036, this amounts to an additional total of approximately 62 billion m3 of gas
over the planning period, which would be the assumed gas prices require an
additional (undiscounted) US$ 36 billion18  SELECTED SCENARIOS FOR THE ARMENIAN
ENERGY SYSTEM:  This Chapter provides  summary of key results in comparing the
Baseline-Reference (BASE-) Scenario with  set of alternative scenarios
identified as of interest by key sector stakeholders Full detailed outputs for
each Scenario are presented in Annex   GDP GROWTH SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
SENSITIVITY ANALYSES DESCRIPTION The BASE- scenario assumed that GDP growth will
stay constant after 2022, at the level of % per year Taking into consideration
that GDP is the main driver of demand growth, two sensitivity scenarios have
been modeled to analyze the influence of different GDP growth rates on the
Armenian energy system’ least cost development pathway In particular, the cases
of  50% higher growth rate (75% per year) and  50% lower rate (25% per year)
have been analyzed Figure  below shows the modelled levels of GDP for each
milestone year at the three growth rate levels 18 To calculate gas volumes
between milestone years, the same interpolation rules were applied as for
modelling the supply sector, , that changes in natural gas supply will be
ensured only by the Russian pipeline Therefore, the Russian gas conversion
factor of 88 TJ/million m3 has been used 50 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY

anticipated, Table  shows that total system costs are estimated to increase by
around % in the case with  50% higher GDP growth rate and to decrease by % in
scenario with  50% lower GDP growth rate as compared to the BASE- scenario With
higher GDP growth reflecting broader development of the economy at large, this
results in an increase of energy use to cover the enlarged demand It is
interesting to note that while the higher rate of GDP growth leads to an overall
level of GDP nearly 47% higher than in the BASE- scenario, energy system costs
increases by  significantly lower percentage Similarly, while the lower level of
GDP growth leads to lower energy system total costs, the reduction of % is less
than the overall decrease in GDP of 23% compared to BASE- TABLE : GDP GROWTH

As shown in Table  below, in case with  50% higher GDP growth rate, the overall
increase in TPES is %, which is largely due to the additional use of imported
natural gas as compared to BASE- by around 138 PJ (roughly  billion m3),
followed by oil products at around 52 PJ, and by RES reaching  PJ over the
entire planning period Again, as with total system costs, this increase in TPES
is significantly lower than the overall USAIDGOV ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY
DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  | 51 increase in GDP, indicating  reduced energy intensity of
economic activity In case of  50% lower rate of GDP growth, reduced demand
results in less use of imported natural gas by 83 PJ (around  billion m3), of
oil products by 29 PJ and of RES by nearly  PJ as compared to the BASE-
scenario, again with TPES declining in percentage terms by less than the overall

Figure  GDP Growth Scenarios: Comparison of TPES with BASE- (TJ) As shown in
Table  below, the higher GDP growth rate results in an increase of FEC by %,
slightly higher than in the growth of TPES Referring to the more detailed
outputs of the TIMES Armenia model, the data show that the higher income growth
in fact creates possibilities to use more efficient and more expensive
technologies on the demand side This is also seen from Table , where the amount
of money spent to purchase demand devices increases by almost 19% in comparison
with BASE- scenario It is useful to note that the significant growth of FEC is
driven by increased use of gas and oil products to meet increased demand in the
Transport and Residential sectors The reverse situation is shown in the lower
GDP growth rate scenario, in which lower income growth results in  decrease both
of FEC by % and purchases of demand devices by around 11% 52 | ARMENIA LEAST

TIMES Armenia model analysis of the effects of higher and lower GDP growth
rates, covering the range of +/- 50% over the period from 2022 to 2036,
confirmed expected increases (and decreases) in energy supply, end use
consumption and GHG emissions, with interesting impacts from the increased
adoption of energy efficient demand devices in the case of rising incomes which
lead to an overall pattern of decreasing energy intensity per unit of GDP as
income rises (with conversely less impact when incomes fall) The key finding of
this sensitivity analysis is that there are no differences in total new power
plant capacities by type required to cover electricity demand between the two
GDP growth scenarios as compared to the BASE- scenario, with only the
implementation schedule for new solar, wind and hydro being very slightly
different depending on the required consumption level in each time period Thus,
there is virtually no impact as well on the investment requirement for new
electricity generation capacity as compared to the BASE- scenario The only
effect of higher income growth lies in the increased (decreased) utilization of
existing installed capacity of both RES and gas-fired thermal power plants, with
concomitant increase (decrease) in expenditures on natural gas fuel Given this
key result, no further detailed sensitivity analyses of the impacts of higher
and lower growth rates is reported for other scenarios  NUCLEAR DEVELOPMENT
SCENARIOS  SCENARIOS DESCRIPTION Activities to extend the operational lifetime
of the ANPP up to 2027 are already in place and the plant was included in the
BASE- Scenario to be decommissioned from that time Given that the available
nuclear technologies included in the TIMES-Armenia model were not selected on
the basis of least cost in the BASE- 58 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT
PLAN:  USAIDGOV Scenario and that the GOAM as  matter of policy remains
committed to maintain some nuclear power in the country’ energy mix, the
following alternatives for continued inclusion of nuclear generation in the
Armenia system are examined: ) Forced implementation of  new nuclear plant upon
ANPP decommissioning, in particular:  Forced implementation of  new nuclear
unit with installed capacity 300 MW (Small Modular Reactor - SMR); and  Forced
implementation of  new nuclear unit with installed capacity 600 MW ) Further
life extension of ANPP, in line with international experience and ensuring all
required safety upgrades (, in the  extension of NPPs lifetime this could be as
long as 80 years ( life-to-80-years), in particular:  Operating life extension
of the ANPP for an additional  years after 2027 - up to 2032, with $300 million
of additional investment; and  Operating life extension of the ANPP for an
additional 10 years after 2027 - up to 2037, with$600 million of additional
investment Thus, four () Nuclear Scenarios have been developed starting from the
BASE- Scenario and for each of them one of the above forced options has been
allowed  NUCLEAR SCENARIO RESULTS As shown in Table , life extension of the ANPP
to 2032 reduces total energy system cost19 by %, while extension to 2037 reduces
it by %, principally through reduced use of imported natural gas and the fact
that additional investment costs for new generation are reduced Forcing the
build of new nuclear plants increases overall energy system costs compared to
BASE- by from  – %, depending on the size of new reactor, where savings
associated with reduced fuel costs are more than offset by the higher costs for
the new nuclear units which are built TABLE : NUCLEAR SCENARIOS, TOTAL SYSTEM

above shows how the development of the various nuclear options from 2027 will
replace other energy sources, primarily imported gas and to  lesser extent RES20
The data in Table 10 below indicate that in all the nuclear scenarios there is
an overall increase in TPES21 Because part of the calculation of TPES starts
from electricity produced and works backward to fuel used, the fact that NPP
efficiency is around 33% means that the forced production of additional nuclear
power electricity generation as compared to BASE- is replacing the gas used in
CCGTs, which have an efficiency of around 56%  further factor contributing to
the increase in TPES in these scenarios is that some of the extra electricity
replaces gas used directly in demand side devices that have efficiencies more
than 60% TABLE 10: NUCLEAR SCENARIOS, PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLIES Scenario BASE-

entire planning horizon, given that there is more forced nuclear generation
available after 2027 in these scenarios it is also economically more attractive
to have  slight reduction in the implementation of renewables prior to 2027;
this leads to the noted small increase in use of natural gas for generation to
cover this gap as compared to BASE- scenario 21 The figures in the table at the
bottom of Figure  present average values for the relevant milestone period Thus,
here and hereafter all the cumulative value for the entire planning horizon is

of the planning horizon Compared with the BASE- scenario, all the nuclear option
scenarios delay deployment of new solar PV generation capacity, although in all
cases the full amount of constrained new solar capacity (,500 MW) is added
during the planning horizon to Similarly, all the nuclear option scenarios delay
deployment of new wind capacity until later in the planning horizon, and in the
case of the new-nuclear LWR 600 MW capacity scenario overall new wind generation
capacity grows to less than its constrained limit (500 MW) by just over 100MW

the ANPP, the total installed capacity of new power plants is the same as in
BASE-, with differences in the timing of the implementation schedule for new
hydro, solar, and wind facilities In the scenario with ANPP life extension up to
the end of the planning period, overall new generation capacity is reduced by
-%, as noted earlier through the exclusion of new medium-sized hydro plants In
both scenarios that introduce new nuclear capacity after the decommissioning of
ANPP, the additional capacity increases of 300 and 600 MW for the new nuclear
units is offset by the elimination of medium-sized hydro (141 MW), while in the
LWR 600 MW scenario there is  further reduction of new wind generation capacity
(by 114 MW) Table 13 below presents projected installed electricity generation
capacities by plant or plant type for each scenario As noted earlier, the
scenarios including nuclear generation lead to somewhat later introduction of
wind, with slightly reduced level compared to constraint limits in the LWR 600

REPLACEMENT OF GAS TO ELECTRICITY  SCENARIO DESCRIPTION The analysis of final
energy consumption by energy carriers and sectors showed that the most consumed
fuel source in Armenia is and will continue to be imported natural gas,
virtually all of which is used for residential heating and transport Since
increased electricity generation based on the development of renewable energy
resources is indicated as  least cost solution in the BASE- scenario, expanding
the use of these domestic energy resources could be accompanied by
implementation of policies to stimulate use of electricity in the transport and
in residential sectors to replace natural gas imports To explore these
opportunities, we examine the following scenarios: • • Increase in the
penetration level for the use of electricity in residential heating to 25% in
2027 and to 50% by 2036; Increase in the penetration level for use of electric
vehicles to 25% in 2027 and to 50% by 2036; and • Both of these scenarios
combined  REPLACEMENT OF GAS TO ELECTRICITY SCENARIOS RESULTS As shown in Table
25 the total system cost will decrease by around % in the scenario with forced
penetration of electricity use for residential heating and by around % in case
when 50% of the transport stock comprises electric cars by the end of planning
period In the combined scenario, the total system cost 76 | ARMENIA LEAST COST

all scenarios there is an overall decrease in TPES, primarily because of reduced
use of imported natural gas and oil products In the residential heating
scenario, replacement of natural gas consumption by electricity results in
savings of around 76 PJ of natural gas (roughly  billion m3) over the entire
planning period In the electric vehicle scenario, the TPES savings amount to 79
PJ which comes from  combination of reduce use of oil products (61 PJ) and gas
(31 PJ), while at the same time there is an increase of around 12 PJ of
renewable energy sources to cover the increased electricity demand Finally, in
the combined scenario the total savings in TPES compared to BASE- amounts to 153
PJ, of which 105 PJ is from reduced use of gas and  little more than 60 PJ from
oil products, which again there is an additional 12 PJ of renewable energy
sources to balance the total energy demand TABLE 26: REPLACEMENT OF GAS TO

below illustrates these changes in composition of TPES as compared to the BASE-

scenarios we see  slight increase in renewables, as expected Given that oil
products are not used in residential heating, all of their reduction in TPES is
found in the scenario with increased use of electric vehicles In the scenario
with residential heating increased to 50% from electricity by the end of the
planning period, we see reduction of total natural gas supply (import) by around
%, while the share of renewables in primary energy supply has practically not
changed In the scenario with 50% electric vehicles in the transport sector by
2036 we see  significant reduction of TPES from oil products by % and of natural
gas by %, as well as around % increase of renewable energy sources The
indicators for the combined scenario are close to the aggregated data from these

Gas to Electricity Scenarios: Comparison of TPES with BASE- (PJ) Table 27 below
shows that forcing higher levels of electricity use in residential heating and
for transport results in reductions of FEC by % and % respectively compared to
the BASE- scenario In the residential heating scenario, these changes primarily
arise due to the more aggressive replacement of energy used by “Standard” demand
technologies (490 PJ) by the more efficient “Advanced” (35 PJ), “Better” (68 PJ)
and “Improved” (169 PJ) technologies In the electric vehicle scenario, this
reduction arises both from introducing electric transport technologies (27 PJ)
and by replacing existing oil product-using technologies (58 PJ) by more
advanced gas-using technologies (69 PJ) Finally, in the combined scenario there
is an increase of electricity consumption by around 33 PJ in both the

we see (in the “Gas-fired” line) that after 2027 there is increased use of the

FROM ENERGY SECTOR COMPARED TO BAU BY 2036  SCENARIO DESCRIPTION Armenia as
party to the Paris Agreement24 has undertaken obligations to reduce its GHG
emissions to the level defined in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
but meeting these targets will be  challenge This scenario examines the impact
on energy system development costs of meeting Armenia’ adopted NDC obligations,
which were not an imposed constraint in the BASE- scenario In particular, this
scenario forces the NDC target of 127,000 ktons of CO2-equivalent emissions over
the entire planning period, which is very close to  10% GHG reduction as
compared to BASE- by 2036, the Cumulative GHG 127 Mt Scenario We also examine
scenario where value of the 2036 GHG emissions target is shifted forward, to be
achieved by 2030, the GHG Target by 2030 Scenario This scenario allows us to
assess policy options associated with additional reduction of GHG emissions,
which would provide the possibility to transfer some amount of 24 The Paris
Agreement (2016) is an accord within the United Nations Framework Convention on

PLAN:  USAIDGOV Armenian GHG reduction limits to later years, or sell credits in
the GHG market, or some combination of both  REDUCED GHG SCENARIO RESULTS It is
obvious that limitation of GHG emissions can be achieved by reduction of fossil
fuel use Such  target could be reached by broad replacement of existing “dirty”
technologies by non-fossil fuel ones on the demand side, and by wider
implementation of renewable resources and nuclear options in electricity
generation The TIMES Armenia model results presented below summarize the
possible pathways to meet Armenia’ NDC obligations, while ensuring the least-
cost solution on energy system development over the entire planning horizon
Given that we continue to maintain the cap on level of deployment of renewables
from the BASE- scenario, it follows that further reductions in GHG from the
generation side would be driven by the next non- carbon technology, , nuclear
While increased efficiency can also arise on the demand side, but it this
scenario we maintain the same energy efficiency adoption assumptions as in the
BASE- scenario As shown in Table 32, the total system cost will increase by
around % in case of limitation of GHG emission in line with NDC requirements,
and by % in the scenario where this target is reached in As will be shown later,
this is primarily due to reduction of natural gas use for electricity generation
in power sector through its replacement by electricity produced by  new 600 MW
nuclear unit (Figure 23) As Shown in Figure 23, while the Cumulative GHG 127 Mt
scenario very closely resembles the earlier New Nuclear scenario with  600 MW
NPP added, there are differences in the implementation schedule, as the earlier
forced nuclear scenario brought the plant into the system from 2027, while this
GHG reduction brings it on line in 2033, which results in  small difference in
total system cost due to discounting In the GHG Target by 2030 scenario there is
also  different implementation schedule, with nuclear capacity added as compared
to the earlier 300 MW (SMR) scenario Figure 23 further shows how reaching the
NDC target GHG emission limitation with nuclear and renewable replaces primarily
imported natural gas TABLE 32: GHG TARGET SCENARIOS, TOTAL SYSTEM COSTS Scenario
BASE- Cumulative GHG 127Mt GHG Target by 2030 System Cost 2015$ 41,029 41,392
42,676 % Difference % % The data in Table 33 below indicate that in both of the
GHG reduction scenarios there is an overall increase in TPES As was explained
earlier in the description of the nuclear scenarios, the fact that NPP
efficiency is around 33% means that the scenario-driven generation of additional
nuclear electricity as compared to BASE- is replacing the gas used in CCGTs,
which have an efficiency of around 56%, contributes to this increase in TPES
Again, as the timing of implementation for new nuclear generation in these GHG
reduction scenarios differs from the nuclear scenarios, there are slight
differences in primary energy needs in each milestone period  further factor
influencing these results lies in the switching for demand devices to replace
higher carbon emitting technologies with lower emission ones ( oil products in
the Transport sector being replaced by “cleaner” gas-using devices) USAIDGOV

Figure GHG Target Scenarios, Construction of New Power Plants (by type), MW In
the GHG Target by 2030 scenario the least-cost solution is achieved by
construction of both Loriberd and Shnokh HPPs in 2030 to meet the requirements
on additional GHG emission reduction at this milestone year, with nearly the
full permissible limited amount of solar (,448 MW) and 500 MW of wind farms, as
well as two 300 MW nuclear units, the first added in 2022 and the second in
While the objective of this scenario is to examine how an earlier move to the
NDC GHG limitation affects system outcomes, it is important to highlight that
while having  new 300 MW SMR by 2022 is not feasible, both scenarios clearly
indicate that introduction of new nuclear generation together with some demand-
side management activities represents the least-cost solution to reduce GHG
emissions Table 35 summarizes the total of new electricity power generation
capacity installed over the planning horizon for both GHG reduction scenarios
and compares them to the BASE- scenario There is  significant increase in new
power plant capacities compared to the BASE- scenario, with these additions
arising from GHG emission “free” technologies, such as nuclear, hydro, solar and
wind, which reduce the utilization of already-installed thermal power plants
Table 36 below presents projected installed electricity generation capacities by
plant or plant type for each of the GHG reduction scenarios, as well as the
BASE- scenario As noted earlier, these scenarios with inclusion of nuclear
generation results in somewhat less solar capacity, while the more aggressive
policy on emission reduction results in adding 600 MW of new nuclear, as well as
both medium-sized HPPs Figure 26 shows the aggregate projected generation levels
by plant type over the planning horizon, which for the most part mirrors the
installed capacity trends above, with the notable exception of gas-fired plants

PLAN:  | 89  FORCED IMPLEMENTATION OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY TARGETS  SCENARIO
DESCRIPTION As noted earlier in Chapter , the Government of Armenia’ policy is
to promote energy efficiency in all economic sectors according to definitions
formulated in the Law on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (2004; amended
in 2016), and as articulated in  number of subsequent Government-approved
Programs and Action Plans over the last 15 years An approved National Energy
Efficiency Action Plan (2017) is currently in place and the second stage is
approved by the Government and in force Nevertheless, as no specific long-term
energy efficiency targets have been articulated we proposed to consider
scenarios for forced reduction of FEC at the levels of 25% and 50% over the
planning horizon to When examining these proposed scenarios within the TIMES
Armenia model, it was found that implementation of  50% energy efficiency target
was not feasible In order to find the highest possible feasible level of energy
efficiency targets, further sensitivity runs for 40% and 30% reductions were
performed and these cases were not also found to be feasible Thus, in this
section we examine and present the results only for  targeted 25% improvement of
energy efficiency  ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCENARIO RESULTS This scenario has been
modeled to force  25% reduction in total of final energy consumption (FEC)
across all demand sectors by Table 41 shows that as  result of primary energy
savings the overall system cost will decrease by around %, savings roughly equal
to US $ billion As will be detailed further below this arises mostly due to fuel
costs savings, for although the new higher efficiency technologies which are
forced in implementation may have higher investment costs, their reduced use of
fuel leads to this overall total system cost reduction TABLE 41: 25% REDUCED FEC

in reaching the target of 25% reduced FEC by 2036, TPES over the entire planning

demand devices used throughout the economy TABLE 42: 25% REDUCED FEC SCENARIO:

ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  USAIDGOV  SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The
fact that the full amount of solar and wind capacity is selected by the model as
part of the least cost solution for new generation under all scenarios
underscores the importance to Armenia of ensuring  policy and institutional
environment that supports full realization of new VRES generation to the maximum
extent practicable, not only to ensure the lowest cost generation but also to
minimize reliance on other imported energy sources and to strengthen Armenia’
energy security and competitiveness As noted earlier, the TIMES-Armenia model
provides  platform for integrated energy system modelling that is designed to
guide policy formulation over  wide range of energy, economic and environmental
planning and policy issues, and thereby help to establish investment priorities
within  comprehensive framework Key aspects of the TIMES platform include that
it: ) encompasses the entire energy system from resource extraction through to
end-use demands (“well-to-wheels”); ii) employs least-cost optimization to
identify the most cost-effective pattern of resource use and technology
deployment over time; iii) provides  framework to evaluate medium- to long-term
policies and programs that can impact the evolution of the energy system; and
iv) quantifies the costs and technology choices that result from imposing those
policies and program Besides the strengths of the core modelling features of
TIMES, the framework includes powerful model management tools to facilitate the
effective use to inform decisionmakers Thus, the TIMES platform is specifically
tool to develop and compare scenarios for future energy development and as such
can be  productive tool to foster stakeholder buy-in and build consensus The
following sections highlight some of the key insights for energy sector policy
development in Armenia over the period to 2036 that can be gleaned from the
detailed scenario analyses presented above To facilitate this discussion, we
have gathered selected key modelling metrics and ratios in Tables  and  Detailed
model results for each of the core scenarios can be found in Appendix   THE
BASELINE REFERENCE (BASE-) SCENARIO The TIMES-Armenia modelling exercise started
by imposing no constraints on the technology choice for future energy sector
development  key result of this exercise was to identify expansion of variable
renewable energy sources (VRES), in particular solar and wind energy, as the
clear least-cost sources for new generation capacity, given the combination of
Armenia’ rich solar resource and trends in declining cost of solar power over
the planning period As  result, the level of projected VRES capacity in the
initially unconstrained variant of the baseline scenario was so high, adding
nearly ,000 MW of grid-connected solar and over ,000 MW of wind power by 2036,
it was clear that some more reasonable levels of constrained expansion of VRES
generation would be needed, both to reflect potential limitations in
institutional capacity to build so much new solar and wind in the coming decades
and to ensure the planning and investment for any needed system strengthening
that might be required to accommodate the higher shares of VRES in the total
generation mix Thus, through expert consultation with stakeholders it was agreed
that  reasonable level of constrained maximum VRES capacity to be modelled would
be set at ,500 MW of solar and 500 MW of wind until the end of the planning
horizon, along with limits on the annual build rates This set of added
assumptions was then applied to the baseline model and the results, described
earlier and summarized in Tables  and  establish the Baseline Reference (BASE-)

this scenario - as was ultimately seen in all other scenarios as well - the full
amount of constrained solar and wind capacity is added, reflecting its
significant role as  least-cost source of electricity for Armenia’ development
While some additional hydropower capacity is added in the BASE- scenario to
account for licenses already provided by PSRC, no other types of new generation
are selected by the model (taking into account that the gas-fired Yerevan CCGT-
TPP is already included from 2022) and recognizing that this scenario foresees
closure of the ANPP from 2027 according to current planning The total funding
required for new power plant construction in this scenario is just under $
billion, while projected imported natural gas fuel expenditures for electricity
generation are $25 billion Finally, in the BASE- scenario total energy system
costs27 account for roughly 11% of GDP over the planning period, while the
energy intensity of GDP as measured by TPES is around 37 MJ/$ Taking into
consideration that GDP growth is the main driver of energy demand growth, two
sensitivity analyses were modelled to explore the influence of higher and lower
GDP growth rates on the Armenian 27 As noted earlier, these are the net present
value of the sum of costs projected by the model associated with ensuring
development and operation of Armenia’ energy system to meet the projected energy
consumption over the period to 2036, comprising all costs associated with both
the supply of energy and with end-use demands for energy across all five sectors
of the model, , agriculture, commercial, industry, residential, and transport
Investment costs in the model methodology include not only the spending required
to build new power plants or new industrial facilities, but also the costs
associated with replacing existing facilities and further include all spending
on such end-use energy items as new or replacement electrical appliances,
heating/cooling devices, cars and trucks and industrial and agricultural
equipment Similarly, for each final energy consumption sector, the variable and
fixed operation and maintenance costs include all costs, required to ensure safe
and uninterrupted operation of all the technologies and installations not only
in the supply, transmission and distribution systems, but also for all consumer
(demand) needs, while fuel costs include fuels for transport and residential
heating, as well as for electricity generation and industrial processes USAIDGOV
ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  | 99 energy system’ least cost
development pathway In particular, the cases analysed were for  50% higher
growth rate (75% per year from 2022) and  50% lower rate (25% per year from
2022, as compared to the % per annum GDP growth rate in the BASE- scenario
surprising but crucial result of these sensitivity analyses is that the model
projects no differences in total new power plant capacities in level or by type
required to cover electricity demand over the full range of GDP growth
variation, with only slight variations in the implementation schedule for new
solar, wind and hydro power depending on the required consumption level in each
time period Thus, there is virtually no impact as well on the investment
requirement for new electricity generation capacity as compared to the BASE-
scenario The only effect of higher (lower) income growth lies in the increased
(decreased) utilization of existing installed capacity of both VRES and gas-
fired thermal power plants, with  concomitant increase (decrease) in
expenditures on natural gas fuel Given this key result, no further detailed
sensitivity analyses of the impacts of higher and lower growth rates was
reported for any of the other scenarios While these higher (lower) growth rates
have expected impacts in regard to increasing (decreasing) total system costs,
TPES, FEC and electricity generation, it is especially interesting to note that
the higher GDP growth rate also reduces the share of total system cost in GDP,
owing to the fact that it is accompanied by significant lowering of the energy
intensity of  unit of GDP, , by 16% as measured by TPES In fact, the high-growth
case of BASE- projects an even lower level of TPES per unit of GDP than the
scenario which explicitly pursues reduced FEC through expanded energy efficiency
( MJ/$ as compared to  MJ/$) This enhanced efficiency is clearly seen in the
fact that while overall GDP increases in total by 27% compared to the BASE-
scenario, total system costs increase only by 12% and TPES by % This is also
reflected in the fact that aggregate purchases of demand devices increase by
almost 19%, which presumably embeds higher levels of efficiency over time as
incomes rise Conversely, the lower growth has mirroring adverse impacts on
increasing total system costs as  share of GDP and increasing the energy
intensity per unit of GDP  NUCLEAR SCENARIOS Activities to extend the
operational lifetime of the ANPP up to 2027 are already in place and the plant
was included in the BASE- Scenario to be decommissioned from that time Although
the available nuclear technologies included in the TIMES-Armenia model were not
selected on the basis of least cost in the BASE- Scenario, the GOAM remains
committed to  policy to maintain some nuclear power in the country’ energy mix
To analyze the cost and other implications of these choices, four alternative
scenarios for continued inclusion of nuclear generation in the Armenian power
system were examined as:  Operating life extension of the ANPP for an
additional  years after 2027 - up to 2032, with an additional $300 million of to
ensure safety and reliability;  Operating life extension of the ANPP for an
additional 10 years after 2027 - up to 2037, with an additional $600 million of
investment to ensure safety and reliability;  Forced implementation of  new
nuclear unit with installed capacity 300 MW (Small Modular Reactor - SMR), and 
Forced implementation of  new nuclear unit with installed capacity 600 MW (Light
Water Reactor - LWR) 100 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  USAIDGOV
As shown in Table , the scenarios for life extension of the ANPP by  and 10
years, which were not included in BASE-, decrease total system cost by around %,
increase TPES by % and %, reduce GHG emissions significantly by % and % and
decrease imports of natural gas for electricity generation by % and %,
respectively  key feature of these scenarios is that they increase total
investment costs for new power generation capacity % and %, compared the BASE-
scenario, with the higher investment costs for the longer extension being offset
in its impact on total investment by the fact that in this scenario neither of
the mid-sized HPPs (Shnokh and Loriberd) is built The scenarios which propose
new nuclear units to replace the ANPP from 2027 with either  300 MW SMR or  600
MW LWR increase total system cost by around %, increase TPES by % and %, reduce
GHG emissions significantly by % and %, and decrease imports of natural gas for
electricity generation by % and %, respectively  key impact in these scenarios
is that they significantly increase total investment costs for new power
generation capacity compared the BASE- scenario, more than doubling it to $
billion ( 116% increase) for the 300 MW SMR unit and increasing it to over $
billion ( 164% increase) for the 600 MW LWR unit Whether considering total
system cost or investment costs required for new generation, the scenarios for
life extension of the ANPP represent  least-cost policy choice for continuing to
maintain nuclear capacity in Armenia’ energy mix It should be emphasized that
such life extensions must always first and foremost ensure all measures required
for continued safe and reliable operation of these older plants As  final point,
it is useful to note that the scenarios which imposed GHG emissions reduction
targets to meet the level defined in Armenia’ NDC, either by 2036 or earlier,
largely mirror the “new nuclear” scenarios in terms of increases in total system
cost and TPES, reductions in GHG emissions and decreases in imports of natural
gas for electricity generation This is not surprising, given that in these
scenarios, with the constrained amounts of solar and wind VRES fully utilized,
the next choice for lower GHG-emissions generation leads to selection of the new
nuclear technologies, in this case introduction of 600 MW of nuclear power Given
the slightly different implementation patterns for the introduction of nuclear
units in these scenarios as compared to the forced implementation in 2027
examined earlier, the impact on total investment costs for new power generation
capacity is even larger compared to the BASE- scenario, ranging from $ - $
billion  DIFFERENT TRENDS IN IMPORTED GAS PRICES The BASE- scenario assumed that
the natural gas price will increase up to projected European levels by 2027 (the
year of ANPP decommissioning) and after that continue to match European levels
Historically Armenia has negotiated gas prices with Russia below these rates, so
two scenarios were analyzed with lower gas prices as28: • EU trend rate to 2036:
Applies the EU trend growth rate over the entire period to 2036, and • Growth to
$180 by 2027: Assumes the border gas prices grows to US$ 180 m3 by 2027 and
remains fixed at that level until the end of the planning period 28 All cases
start from the same initial border gas price effective from January , 2019, of
US$ 165 per 1000 m3 and all scenarios assume that the current gas
transmission/distribution/supply margin does not change USAIDGOV ARMENIA LEAST
COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  | 101 As expected, analysis of these scenarios
shows that if Russia continues to provide relatively low-cost natural gas to
Armenia there will be  significant increase of natural gas consumption across
all sectors, but mainly in electricity generation, transportation and
residential heating In both scenarios, the expanded use of existing gas-fired
TPP capacity means that the mid-sized HPPs (Shnokh and Loriberd) are not built,
while no additional thermal power capacity is required after the inclusion of
Yerevan CCGT- (RENCO) and the closure of Hrazdan TPP This results in  roughly
20% reduction in the lumpsum investment required for new generation in these
scenarios, the lowest in any scenarios - although still with the constrained
levels of solar and wind generation fully built - which generates an investment
cost saving as compared to BASE- of $377 million in the case with the EU trend
to 2036 and of $391 million when the gas price is capped at $While total energy
system cost is reduced when gas prices are lower, it is important to note that
the increased utilization of cheaper gas maintains and deepens Armenia’
dependence on imported energy In both scenarios there is an overall increase in
TPES, by  - %, because of increased use of the cheaper imported natural gas,
which is accompanied by  reduction in use of VRES In the case when gas prices
follow the EU trend, replacement of renewables by natural gas results in total
additional TPES of around 32 PJ, which is distributed between an increase of 56
PJ (roughly  billion m3) of natural gas and  reduction of renewables use by 22
PJ over the planning period When the gas price is capped at $180 from 2027, the
increase of TPES is roughly 49 PJ, comprising an increase of 85 PJ of gas
(roughly  billion m3), which is offset by  34 PJ reduction of use of renewables
PROMOTING FUEL SWITCHING TO ELECTRICITY IN TRANSPORT AND RESIDENTIAL HEATING
Analysis of FEC by energy carrier and sector showed that the most consumed fuel
source in Armenia is and will continue to be imported natural gas, most of which
is used for residential heating and transport Since increased electricity
generation based on development of Armenia’ VRES is indicated as  least cost
solution in the BASE- scenario, and confirmed in all other scenarios, expanding
use of these domestic energy resources could be accompanied by implementation of
policies to stimulate use of electricity in the transport and residential
sectors to replace natural gas imports To explore these opportunities, we
examined the following scenarios: • Increase in the penetration level for the
use of electricity in residential heating to 25% in 2027 and to 50% by 2036, and
Increase in the penetration level for use of electric vehicles to 25% in 2027
and to 50% by • • Both of these scenarios together As shown in Table , each of
these scenarios proposing increased sectoral electricity penetration separately
reduces total system cost (in combination by %), reduces TPES (again, in
combination by %), lowers GHG emissions (by nearly %, in combination) and
decreases imports of natural gas for electricity generation (in combination by
%) The reduction in natural gas used for electricity generation shows clearly
that  policy to promote increased deployment of electric heating and vehicles
will expand utilization of domestic VRES, reduce reliance on imported energy
sources and strengthen Armenia’ energy security Most importantly, no change in
the overall level and type of new generation is required by the model as
compared to the BASE- scenario to achieve these results, with only  negligible
increase in the lumpsum investment costs for new generation capacity associated
with slight variations in the implementation schedule for the projected
additions of solar and wind power 102 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY DEVELOPMENT

cooking and for electricity demand between heat, hot water, cooking, air

preparation and cooking remain unchanged throughout the year, while differences
between winter and summer consumption patterns are reflected heating demands The

(ktoe) The structure of fuel and electricity consumption in the Transport sector
of Armenia differs radically from that of similar the countries in the region
and those of Commonwealth of Independent States as  whole These specific
characteristics are largely based on the following factors:  Long-term
transportation blockade of the country by Turkey and Azerbaijan limiting trading
opportunities (export/import);  High prices for imported oil products; and 
Existing transport infrastructure (fully electrified railway transport, ground
and underground urban electric transport, developed road network, etc) Thus, the
availability and relative low cost of natural gas compared to liquid motor fuels
led to  massive shift of the road transport to the use of natural gas By the
early 2000’, up to 90% of the light vehicles and most of urban public transport
are equipped with dual fuel systems using natural gas with gasoline as  backup
fuel As  result, an extensive network of gas charging stations has been
established, covering almost the entire country and  drastic reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions was recorded in the transport sector between 1998 and

it is important to establish consistent characteristics for the different plant

is also ALWR type For Armenia, the size of nuclear plant is important Because of
this, the economy of scale of nuclear plants was applied to calculate the costs
of smaller versions of ALWR, establishing consistent data for competitive
analysis of nuclear plants of different size, as discussion below The Projected

light water reactors and generic generation III reactors For new designs, net
plant capacities range from around ,000 to ,300 MW (for  multiple-unit plant in

technologies, indicating that the industry trend towards this technology
continues TABLE lists the nuclear plants in Projected Costs of Generating

there is there is  large difference in nuclear costs between Europe, US and Asia

power plants for Armenia The Russian VVER version, for example, is the one
deployed in Hungary, with  cost of ,215 USD2013/kW Another study for South
Africa31 shows an estimated overnight capital cost of $50-billion (including
owners development costs but excluding interest during construction) for   GW

of USD5,776 per kW net output is calculated However cost for  single unit will
be higher by 10 to 20%, which will result in the number around ,600 USD/kW As
seen from TABLE the Chinese, Korean and US versions are considerably cheaper
Based on this we suggest two versions of ALWR, one based on average
characteristics of ALWR globally and the second based solely on Hungary data It
should be mentioned that TABLE also includes the nuclear power plant in Mohovce,
Slovak Republic, which consists of  blocks with 513MW each However, this is for
project originally initiated in 1986, the design of which has evolved
substantially from the original water-cooled and water-moderated reactor (VVER)
-213 specifications, because of this it is not considered Emerging nuclear
technologies in the  timeframe include small modular reactors (SMRs),
essentially based on the same technology as today’ generation III reactors
(namely light water reactors) There are wide- ranging projections for installed
SMR capacity by Because of their size the specific per-MW costs of SMRs are
likely to be higher (typically 50% to 100% higher per kWh for  single SMR plant)
than those of large generation III reactors Variable costs (& and fuel costs)
for SMRs most likely will remain higher than for large nuclear plants as well
Based on Current Status, Technical Feasibility and Economics of Small Nuclear
Reactors (NEA 2011)32, because of economies of scale, SMRs will suffer
significant economic disadvantage compared to large reactors in terms of their
overnight costs per unit of installed capacity Specific capital costs ( capital
costs per unit of installed capacity) are expected to decrease with size because
of fixed set-up costs ( siting activities or earth works for connecting to the
transmission grid), more efficient utilization of primary inputs ( raw
materials), and the higher performance of larger components ( pumps, heat
exchangers, steam generators, etc) Several studies have employed the following
scaling function to illustrate the effect of changing from  plant unit size P0
to  plant of similar design with capacity P1: Cost(P1) = Cost(P0)(P1/P0) ()
where Cost(P1) and Cost(P0) are the costs of power plants of size P1 and P0
respectively, and  is the scaling factor for the entire plant (this is an
overall scaling law for the entire plant—different components of the plant may
have substantially different scaling exponentsCurrent Status, Technical

economies of scale if  sufficiently large number of identical SMR designs are
built and replicated in factory assembly workshops Lower overall investment
costs and shorter construction times for SMRs could also facilitate the
financing of such reactors compared to large nuclear plants at lower costs of
capital) Furthermore, they can be more discretely sized accorded to the capacity
needed owing to the modular nature of the design So, other sensitivity scenarios
can be performed for higher  in formula () which will analyze the sensitivity of
results compared to the future costs of SMRs In all cases Decommissioning costs
for nuclear plants are higher than those for other generation types, in part
because of the additional cost of removing all remaining radioactive materials
Plant-specific decommissioning costs were used when provided, and  default
assumption of 15% of the overnight cost was used for all other plants Prototypes
of generation IV reactors, that could include very-high-temperature reactors
(VHTR) for electricity and process heat applications, and liquid metal-cooled
reactors such as sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFR) and lead-cooled fast reactors
(LFR), were not considered In terms of generation costs, generation IV
technologies aim to be at least as competitive as generation III technologies
(and will build on the enhanced safety levels of those technologies), though the
additional complexity of these designs, the need to develop  specific supply
chain for these reactors and the development of the associated fuel cycles will
make this  challenging task However, generation IV also provide additional
benefits in terms of fuel utilization and waste management (especially for fast
neutron reactors) or in terms of high thermal efficiency (>40%), and potential
for high temperature process heat application for HTRs and this could represent
an economic advantage over alternative technologies 114 | ARMENIA LEAST COST
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  USAIDGOV  SOLAR POWER PLANTS Solar PV plants are
divided into three categories: Residential rooftop (less than 20 kWe),
Commercial rooftop (from 20 kWe to  MWe), and large (greater than  MW) ground-
mounted central plants In addition we consider solar thermal technologies, which
are able to produce significant amounts of power (installation sizes tend to
range from the tens to hundreds of megawatts) and can be used with thermal
storage solutions such as molten salts to extend their electric power production
into peak evening hours Conversely, solar thermal power plants use more
materials, in particular steel, than other types of solar power, and so are
relatively more capital-intensive and will often also have higher operation and
maintenance (&) costs For Armenia, we have selected two options from the US, one
with -hour storage, which reaches annual Capacity Factor (CF) =34% and another
with 12 hour storage reaching CF=50, as opposed to PVs whose CF range between
15%-20% in US) However, for Armenia country-specific CFs are used for all Solar

storage technologies absorb energy and store it for  period of time before
releasing it to supply energy or power services Through this process, storage
technologies can bridge temporal and geographical gaps between energy supply and
demand Some technologies such as pumped storage hydropower are mature; however,
improvements can be made with respect to the ratio of electric capacity to
storage volume; flexibility in pumping mode with variable-speed pumps, and sea
water pumped storage hydropower, to better help integrate variable renewables
Most other technologies are still at early stages of development and will
require further RD& before their potential can be fully realized Emerging
electricity storage technologies include compressed air energy storage (CAES),
adiabatic CAES,  range of batteries, flywheels and hydrogen storage Investment
in energy storage RD& has led to significant cost reductions In addition, costs
for large-scale batteries have shown impressive reductions, thanks in part to
ambitious electric vehicle deployment programs and greater demand for frequency
regulation The cost of  lithium-ion battery for grid-scale storage has shown the
largest decline, falling by more than three-quarters between 2008 and However,
additional efforts, including targeted & investments and demonstration projects,
are needed to further decrease energy storage costs and accelerate development

SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE HPPS Lack of fossil fuel in Armenia dictates the necessity
to utilize domestic energy sources (hydro, wind, solar, etc) as much as
ecologically and economically feasible With respect to small hydro resources,
according to PSRC data, in addition to existing 186 small hydro power plants
(SHPPs) with total installed capacity MW, 31 companies have licenses for
construction of 88 MW SHPPs At this stage, no additional SHPPs are foreseen for
construction due to new more stringent ecological and technical requirements,
changes in water resources patterns, in part due to global warming, and the
absence of economically feasible locations 34  116 | ARMENIA LEAST COST ENERGY
DEVELOPMENT PLAN:  USAIDGOV As stated by Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and
Natural Resources, there is still potential for development of medium-size HPPs
, in particular Lori-Berd, Shnokh and Meghri35 Below are some main indicators
for these projects Lori-Berd HPP Construction of the Lori-Berd HPP (with around
60MW of installed capacity and 200 million kWh of annual energy production) on
the Dzoraget river plays important role for the Armenian hydro energy sector
development In the years  Fichtner prepared  feasibility study for the above-
mentioned station In February 2007, Fichtner updated the price calculations for
the project Price increases were mostly attributed to higher equipment cost
Lori-Berd HPP Is planned to be constructed in the northern part of Armenia,
where there are not large production entities, and would strengthen the energy
supply to the northern parts of the country, as well as provide the energy
system with opportunities for parallel operation between Armenia and Georgia It
is foreseen to implement the Lori-Berd HPP construction by attracting private
financial investment Lori-Berd HPP characteristics are as follows:  Design head
