available in:               Chinese (中文) This report contains the latest
developments and good practices to develop grid connection codes for power
systems with high shares of variable renewable energy – solar photovoltaic and
wind. The analysis is an update of the 2016 IRENA report  Scaling up variable
renewable power: The role of grid codes .  There is an urgent need to adopt
clean energy solutions to cope with growing demand for energy and replace
existing polluting generators. The inclusion of variable renewable energy
introduces challenges to system operation. As renewable energy is variable,
uncertain, location constrained and inverter-based, replacing conventional
synchronous generation technologies. Furthermore, the power system is becoming
more decentralised, digitalised and end-use sectors more electrified. These
trends are driving the growth of the power system in a new and different
direction. All of this comes at a cost to the system operation, which has to
ensure that the system is stable at all times. Grid codes play a critical role
in building trust between the system operators and stakeholders. They remain one
of the central tools to ensure the security of supply of a power system at any
time. Grid connection codes define technical requirements, regulations, and
behaviour for all active participants in the power system, including power
generators, adjustable loads, storage, and other units. Grid codes are evolving,
to enable innovative technologies to be connected to the network safely, without
compromising the reliability of supply. This report elaborates on the latest
developments and experiences related to technical requirements for connecting
variable renewable energy generators and enabling technologies such as storage,
electric vehicles or flexible demand.   Additional analyses
