industrial sector is the leading hydrogen consumer, with 87.1 million tonnes of
hydrogen consumed in 2020. Hydrogen is used in refineries, chemical industry,
and steelmaking, all categorised as "hard to abate" sectors. This large and
centralised demand is critical for developing a green hydrogen sector. However,
several barriers impede green hydrogen's full contribution to the industrial
sector, including cost, technical, policy, lack of demand and carbon leakage
risk. Policy makers can adopt industrial policies that address barriers and
oblige or support a change from fossil fuel dependency of hard to abate sectors.
An urgent task given the the long lifespans of industrial assets and a limited
window to avert the climate crisis. This report from the International Renewable
Energy Agency (IRENA) provides a basis for understanding the challenges and
policy solutions. It highlights the range of policy options available, including
mandates, carbon pricing, carbon leakage measures, support schemes and market
creation measures and complements these policies with country examples. The
report separates policy recommendations into various stages to formulate
appropriate policy pathways most suitable to a country's level of deployment of
green hydrogen. This is the third guide in a series of reports designed to
explore policies to support green hydrogen. The first report  Green hydrogen: A
guide to policy making , published in November 2020, identified the pillars
needed for creating a policy framework for green hydrogen and the second one,
published in May 2021,  Green hydrogen supply: A guide to policy making ,
explored the challenges for green hydrogen production.   Additional analyses
