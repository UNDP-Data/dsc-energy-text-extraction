pollution                 Achieving universal modern energy access by 2030, in
line with SDG 7, delivers socioeconomic benefits and reduces greenhouse gas
emissions. In addition, major air pollutant emissions are halved by 2030 which
reduces premature deaths by 3.6 million, predominately in emerging market and
developing economies.                Population without modern energy access
