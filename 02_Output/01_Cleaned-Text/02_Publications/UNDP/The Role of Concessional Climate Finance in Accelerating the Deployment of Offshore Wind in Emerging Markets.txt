Concessional Climate Finance in Accelerating the Deployment of Offshore Wind in
Emerging Markets Offshore wind will be critical to achieve the world's
decarbonization  and  sustainable development goals . Although the cost of
offshore wind has dropped dramatically over the past decade, there will be an
initial cost premium when developing offshore wind in emerging markets  due to a
variety of risks and constraints in establishing a new market.  Concessional
climate finance could help  countries overcome this initial cost barrier to help
reduce costs for future projects and lay the foundation for the development of
successful offshore wind markets.   This report from World Bank’s Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and International Finance Corporation
(IFC), finds that concessional climate financing is essential to unlock offshore
wind in emerging markets and estimates that  US$15 billion in concessional
climate financing, consisting of both grants and loans, could catalyze offshore
wind deployment across ten emerging market countries.      According to the
report, concessional climate financing consisting of  US$ 4.8 billion of
concessional public deb t,  US$ 8.3 billion of concessional private debt , and
US$ 2.5 billion in grants  over an initial five-year period would enable the
development of ten pathfinder projects between 500-1,000 MWs each, driving down
the average Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) from US$100 per megawatt-hour
(MWh) to US$70 per MWh.  This concessional financing could therefore be a  key
solution to unlocking offshore wind potential and benefits  in emerging markets,
while representing a big-ticket solution to accelerate the pace of global
decarbonization for donor countries.  Citation Knight,Oliver; Whittaker,Sean;
