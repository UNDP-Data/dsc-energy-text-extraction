(PDF)﻿ This paper studies the nature of municipal building codes restricting
solar adoption and how such local measures impact the adoption of solar
photovoltaics. It focuses on Germany, a leader in solar adoption. The authors
show that national policies promoting the adoption of solar photovoltaics are
partially counteracted by local policies defining the aesthetics of the built
environment. These findings raise important questions on the
(cost-)effectiveness of nationwide efforts promoting the adoption of renewable
energy to increase energy security and to contribute to mitigate climate change.
The study documents that a significant share of German municipalities have
amended their building codes to restrict solar installations, often to preserve
the historical nature of towns, and that these restrictions have an economically
important impact on solar adoption. Using a unique survey of municipalities
collecting information about their building codes, and administrative data on
all solar installations in Germany, the authors show that municipalities that
implement municipal building codes aimed at restricting solar adoption have
10.4% less solar photovoltaic capacity than municipalities in the control group.
The findings have important policy implications: there is a trade-off between
national (and even global) climate change mitigation as well as energy security
goals and local heritage preservation goals. As countries accelerate their
transition towards a cleaner economy and seek to minimise their dependence on
imports of energy from foreign sources, municipal policies potentially need to
be reevaluated, also accounting for technological developments that increasingly
make solar photovoltaics less aesthetically invasive. Key points for decision-
makers The authors created a registry of local solar policies (i.e. municipal
building codes restricting solar adoption) based on survey responses from
municipal officials in Germany. The survey asked how current local building
codes treat the installation of solar panels as well as how past local building
codes did. The survey also tracked information on the specific areas of
municipalities covered by such restrictions, wherever coverage was not
municipality-wide. Regulations of solar installations in some cases include
explicit bans or permit requirements. Other municipalities have more subtle
provisions, for example such that solar installations cannot be visible from the
street. The paper confirms and quantifies the trade-off between national and
global climate change mitigation and energy security goals and local historical
preservation policies. The authors show that many German municipalities regulate
and restrict the installation of solar photovoltaics. A significant portion
(15.1%) of municipalities in the sample have one or more provisions in their
building codes targeted at solar photovoltaics. Municipalities that implement
any type of policy have 8.9% fewer solar photovoltaic installations and a 10.4%
smaller solar capacity than similar municipalities without such policies. The
larger effect on solar capacity shows that municipal policies lead to less
adoption of solar (referred to as the ‘extensive margin’) as well as smaller
installations, conditional on adoption (referred to as the ‘intensive margin’).
Reductions in solar adoption are driven mostly by small to medium-sized
installations of 5–10 kW, consistent with the policy goals of shaping the urban
built environment. The authors conclude that it is crucial for policymakers in
Germany, and in other locations where such local restrictions are widespread, to
take a closer look at the trade-off with heritage preservation. Policymakers
should determine whether these restrictions are still warranted in the current
environment and whether they will be in the future, as technology evolves. For
instance, allowing photovoltaic roof tiles that blend into the built environment
could expand solar capacity in historical towns and other areas where similar
aesthetic considerations apply.                   Solar panels in Oberrarbach in
