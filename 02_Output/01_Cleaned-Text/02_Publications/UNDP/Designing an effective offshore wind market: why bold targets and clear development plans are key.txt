Our work and impact Designing an effective offshore wind market: Why bold
targets and clear development plans are key This policy briefing identifies four
lessons for policymakers aiming to grow offshore wind deployment. Image   Share
Overview Few countries are on track to meet their offshore wind targets and, as
a result, the value of target-setting has been called into question. However,
our experience of advising governments around the world, as well as our analysis
of targets and actual deployment rates in six key markets clearly demonstrates
the positive impact of targets for facilitating market scale and visibility and,
in turn, driving installations. Our analysis of offshore wind development in the
UK, the US, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Vietnam and France highlights four key
takeaways for target-setters:   Targets spur on installations, and ambitious
targets are strongly linked to higher deployment rates.  Targets must be
followed by plans that clearly define processes and responsibilities. Ambitious
targets without coherent action plans can lead to stagnation. Collaborative
initiatives can support market scale and accelerate build-out. File

of policy briefings aiming to help policymakers design effective offshore wind
markets. All policy briefings will be available on the Carbon Trust website.
