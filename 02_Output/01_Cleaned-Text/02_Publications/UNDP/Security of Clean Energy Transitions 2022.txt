About this report This report examines the evolving challenges of maintaining
energy security in the context of clean energy transitions on the pathway to net
zero emissions. The report reflects on the security implications of the triple
global crisis, the climate emergency, the global energy crisis and the social
and economic implications of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The report highlights key
energy security concerns during energy transitions and provides governments,
notably within the Group of Twenty (G20), with policy recommendations for
maintaining and improving energy security, while accelerating clean energy
transitions to address the triple crises.  In the context of Indonesia’s G20
Presidency, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources invited the
International Energy Agency (IEA) to produce a second edition of its Security of
Clean Energy Transitions report, the first having been published in 2021,
building on the G20 Naples Principles.  In the run up to the Bali G20 Energy
Transitions Ministerial in September 2022, this report is intended to support
discussions among the G20 countries and further elaborate on the G20 Naples
Principles, agreed at the G20 energy ministers’ meeting in Naples in 2021, by
providing analysis, insights and recommendations. Published September 2022
