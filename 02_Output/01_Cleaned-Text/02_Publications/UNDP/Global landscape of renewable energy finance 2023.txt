2023   Newsletter    Go Global investment in energy transition technologies,
including energy efficiency, reached a record high of USD 1.3 trillion in 2022.
However, annual investments need to at least quadruple to remain on track to
achieve the 1.5 ° C Scenario in IRENA’s  World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 .
Investment in renewable energy was also unprecedented – at USD 0.5 trillion –
but represented less than one third of the average investment needed each year.
Investments are also not flowing at the pace or scale needed to accelerate
progress towards universal energy access; investments in off-grid renewable
energy solutions in 2021 – at USD 0.5 billion – fell far short of the USD 2.3
billion needed annually in off-grid solar products alone (not including mini-
grids). This third edition of the biannual joint report by the International
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) analyses
investment trends by technology, sector, region, source of finance and financial
instrument in the period 2013-2020 and provides preliminary data for 2021-2022.
It identifies financing gaps to support informed policy making for the
deployment of renewables at the scale needed to accelerate the energy
transition. The report finds that investments have become further concentrated
in specific technologies and uses, and in a small number of countries/regions.
It underscores the need to direct public funds to regions and countries that
have considerable untapped potential but find it difficult to attract
investment. Funding must be focused on supporting energy transition
infrastructure development, as well as enabling policy frameworks to drive
investment and address persistent socio-economic gaps.   Additional analyses
