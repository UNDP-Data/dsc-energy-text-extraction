Browse by theme               By effectively increasing the distance over which
it is cost-effective to transport energy, green hydrogen can unlock new
possibilities for energy trade, giving rise to new players and providing
opportunities for energy exporters to pivot towards a net zero system. In a
1.5°C future, around 25% of hydrogen could be globally traded - half in the form
of ammonia transported by sea, and half through gaseous hydrogen pipelines
concentrated in Europe and Latin America. Around 70% of hydrogen traded would be
used as feedstock and fuel, rather than reconverted to hydrogen following
transport. This report explores key actions and milestones in relation to market
creation, infrastructure and regulation, certification, technology, cost gaps
and financing. It reveals that the share of trade remains relatively constant
across multiple scenarios; but that the outlook for specific countries can
change drastically, depending on assumptions. The most influential and uncertain
parameter is the cost of capital and the differential between countries. Part
