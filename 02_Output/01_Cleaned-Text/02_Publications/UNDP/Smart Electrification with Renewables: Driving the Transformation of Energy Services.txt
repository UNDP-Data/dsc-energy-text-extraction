Full report translations:               Chinese (中文) The world has made the
transition from one dominant form of energy to another several times. The
replacement of fossil fuels with renewables marks the next historic shift. Yet,
to ensure sustainability and global climate stability, this latest energy
transformation needs to happen much faster. Countries around the world need a
vast expansion of renewables, smarter and more flexible electricity grids, and
huge increases in the numbers of vehicles and other products and processes that
run on electricity. Those three elements – combined in a “Smart Electrification”
strategy – will be crucial in shaping the world’s new, renewable-dominated
energy system. This publication provides policy makers with a conceptual
overview of the global transition to electrification with renewables. Crucially,
this work was undertaken jointly by the International Renewable Energy Agency
(IRENA) and the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC). As such, it benefits
from the perspective of the world’s largest grid operator, and one that is
strongly focused on the challenges and opportunities of rapid electrification,
digitalisation and renewables deployment. Combining the perspective of a major
grid operator with IRENA’s global work to foster innovation and technology co-
operation, the publication examines recent trends in relevant technologies and
innovations, sets out possible long-term pathways for electrification with
renewables, and identifies priority actions to enable those pathways. Throughout
the publication, the underlying concern is how to achieve “smart electrification
with renewables”, rather than poorly planned electrification. Smart
electrification with renewables focuses on the potential synergies between major
increases in renewable power generation, electrification and digitalisation, and
looks to create the conditions for the unprecedented co-ordination of their
deployment and more efficient use across end-use sectors – power, transport,
industry and buildings.  A summary of this report and its main findings was
published in 2019 as “ Electrification with Renewables: Driving the
transformation of energy services – A Preview for Policy Makers ”.   Additional
