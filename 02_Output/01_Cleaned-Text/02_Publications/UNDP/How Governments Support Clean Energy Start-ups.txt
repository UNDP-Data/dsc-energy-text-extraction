About this report This report highlights recent initiatives to inspire policy
action at a time when innovation leadership by the public and private sectors is
critical to meeting the net zero challenge. Countries around the world strive to
become home to the next major company emerging from a start-up with a disruptive
clean energy invention, and with good reason. Whilst aiding innovation in
support of climate and energy goals, nurturing innovative start-ups to maturity
can also create local economic prosperity because clean energy transitions will
be a major market opportunity for all countries, all century long. Already, the
number of government policy measures to help start-ups get new clean energy
technologies to market has risen sharply since the Paris Agreement was signed in
2015. This is extremely encouraging given that energy technology start-ups
continue to face challenges attracting patient capital and governments possess
some unique resources to speed them through the phases to reach technical
maturity while staying in business. Based on 14 detailed case studies and in-
depth interviews, this report presents a range of impressive policy measures
from a variety of different country contexts, and identifies eight key insights
for effective policy to support clean energy start-ups. Published March 2022
