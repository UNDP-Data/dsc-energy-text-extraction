September 20 2023 AUTHOR(S) World Bank, ESMAP.   Toward a Framework for the
Sustainable Heating Transition in Europe and Central Asia   This report presents
the results of research and analysis on the status and trends of space heating
conducted in 2022-23. In the long, cold winters in many parts of the Europe and
Central Asia (ECA) region, heating is critical to life and for livelihoods, but
it is currently not sustainable. Energy use for space heating has expanded to 24
percent of total regional energy demand today—of which about 72 percent is
consumed in the residential sector and the remainder in commercial and public
buildings. Fossil fuels—natural gas and coal—have overwhelmingly met this energy
need. Compounded by an aging and energy inefficient building stock, the heating
sector has generated a significant level of emissions, both locally and
globally.  Across the region, air pollution, particularly in urban areas, is a
serious threat that causes 302,000 deaths and incurs a welfare cost of 7 percent
of GDP annually. Annual gross CO 2  emissions from ECA heating of buildings are
estimated to be about 22 percent of total regional emissions, or 678 MtCO 2 , of
which 75 percent is attributed to the residential sector. In urban areas, most
households currently heat their homes with district heating (DH), electricity,
and gas boilers, while in rural areas most households rely on firewood or coal
stoves and boilers. Addressing the considerable challenges in heating is an
urgent imperative for policymakers to ensure heating services are affordable,
efficient, and clean which can in turn bring enormous development benefits. The
decarbonization pathways in ECA countries to net zero by mid-century are
intertwined with sustainable heating. Press Release  | Download the Report:

Clean Household Heating Solutions High efficiency, low emissions (HELE) heating
stoves offer significant benefits for household comfort, public health and air
pollution which is an increasing problem in urban areas in the winter.  May 31
