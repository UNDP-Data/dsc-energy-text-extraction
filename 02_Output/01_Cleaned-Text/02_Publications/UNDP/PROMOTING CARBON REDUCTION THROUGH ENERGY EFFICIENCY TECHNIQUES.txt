Promoting Carbon Reduction Through Energy Efficiency (EE) Techniques in Baghdad
City  Status: Ongoing Duration: 2020-2021 Budget: US$150,000 Coverage: Baghdad
City SDG: SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy and SDG 13: Climate Action
Partners: The Government of Iraq  Programme Summary UNDP is developing the five-
year project “Promoting Carbon Reduction Through Energy Efficiency (EE)
Techniques in Baghdad City”, following support from the vertical UNDP fund for
Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the Government of Iraq (GoI) Ministry of
Health of Environment.  Project activities will be developed in consultation
with all relevant stakeholders, including the private sector and with technical
support from international and national experts in the energy efficiency field.
Key intervention points will be identified through assessment of baseline
legislation and regulatory policies, and best practice for technical solutions
in energy efficiency for infrastructure, in order to identify a suitable Theory
of Change.  The GEF guidelines ensure that the project document is carefully
designed with well identified targets, indicators, and risk mitigation measures.
Social and environmental standards will be screened, and the necessary
mitigation measures developed, as well as a gender action plan to ensure gender
mainstreaming throughout the project.      What we aim to achieve The promotion
of innovation and technology transfer for sustainable energy breakthroughs and
accelerate energy efficiency adoption; Enabling policy, institutional, and
legislative frameworks to support the development of energy efficiency programs
and applications in the building sector; Strengthened individual and
institutional capacity at the national level, including expertise in building
codes & standards and technical knowledge in the energy efficiency buildings
sector; Identification of key intervention points for piloting energy efficiency
solutions.       Search           Found  0  results.            Did you mean   ?
