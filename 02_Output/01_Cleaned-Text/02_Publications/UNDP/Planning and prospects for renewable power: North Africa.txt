Go This report is part of the IRENA series on  Planning and prospects for
renewable power: Africa , which focuses on renewable electricity generation in
African power pools. It represents a key aspect of IRENA’s involvement in the
search for energy transition pathways in the region, supporting the eventual
development of a regional masterplan for power system expansion in North Africa
(Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania and Tunisia), which currently does
not exist in a format similar to other African power pools. Developing such a
regional masterplan is highly significant in the context of the African
Continental Transmission Masterplan. This study shows the importance of regional
coordination in long-term planning, by showcasing collective opportunities for
North African countries to diversify their electricity generation mixes and
reduce their reliance on fossil fuel resources by 2040. The region stands to
benefit from falling renewable energy costs and its ample endowments of wind and
solar energy, as well as from increased interconnections, more battery storage
deployment and, potentially, even green hydrogen production. All of these can
help the region decrease the cost of electricity generation by increasing the
share of renewables in the electricity mix. Interconnections would also bring
flexibility that will complement the more diverse power systems in North Africa
with a higher share of renewable energy. The report’s analysis was conducted
using the  IRENA MESSAGE-SPLAT modelling framework . The framework was recently
endorsed by the five African Power Pools as an official planning tool for the
upcoming  Continental Power Systems Masterplan  Development, an initiative of
the African Union Development Agency, in which IRENA is a partner.   Additional
