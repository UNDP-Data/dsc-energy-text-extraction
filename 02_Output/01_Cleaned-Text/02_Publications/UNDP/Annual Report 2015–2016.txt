Annual Report documents UN Women’s work to foster women’s empowerment and gender
equality around the world. It highlights some of the organization’s initiatives
during the year and provides summary financial statements, a list of new
programmes and projects, and contact information. 2015 was UN Women’s fifth
year. As we marked this milestone, UN Member States agreed on the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development which recognizes the transformative power of women
and girls. Our work around the world contributes to turning the promise of the
Sustainable Development Goals into reality. Working with our diverse partners,
we deliver results, from advancing norms and standards, to expanding women’s
leadership and participation, bolstering women’s economic empowerment, and
ending violence against women and girls. Additional documents PDF version:
