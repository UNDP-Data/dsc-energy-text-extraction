Unabated fossil fuels in electricity generation
Electricity output from unabated fossil fuels falls by 40% to 2030
and virtually disappears by 2050, as plants are run less, retired,
retrofitted with CCUS or repurposed to use low-emissions fuels.

CCUS retrofits and blending low-emissions fuels enable coal- and
gas-fired power plants to contribute to energy transitions
Reducing coal-fired power in EMDE accounts for 60% of global
