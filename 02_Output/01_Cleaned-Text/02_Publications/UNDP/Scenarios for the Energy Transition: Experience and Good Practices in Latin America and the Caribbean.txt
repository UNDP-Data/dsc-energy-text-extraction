También disponible en  Español Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) nations have
used long-term scenarios and energy planning tools to inform national planning
for decades, providing excellent examples of how governments can make strategic
use of such scenarios in the context of complex clean energy transitions. When
the right institutional framework is in place, they can assess alternative
pathways to accelerate the use of renewables toward just and sustainable energy
systems, while also contributing to public debate and supporting consensus on
desired outcomes in the LAC region.  This report summarises such examples
presented throughout the webinar series, “ Long-Term Energy Scenarios (LTES) for
Developing National Clean Energy Transition Plans in Latin America and the
Caribbean ”. It presents key findings and recommendations that are broadly
relevant to Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as to stakeholders
attempting to improve their planning processes across the world. Good practices
are categorised under three main pillars: strengthening scenario development;
improving scenario use; and identifying capacity-building approaches. Key
findings: The LAC region is developing energy  scenarios with a broader scope
that goes beyond techno-economic criteria. A number of LAC governments are
developing  increasingly integrated  and long-term energy scenarios linked to
their climate goals. There is growing emphasis on  participatory scenario
development  as part of energy planning processes in the LAC region. The long-
term scenarios analysed by LAC countries are increasingly based on  larger
shares of renewables  in their energy mixes and on more efficient energy
consumption. Transparent  energy data and statistics  are crucial to the
development of more reliable scenarios. The support provided through
international co-operation  has been crucial in enabling many LAC countries to
develop energy scenarios for medium- and long-term energy planning.   Additional
