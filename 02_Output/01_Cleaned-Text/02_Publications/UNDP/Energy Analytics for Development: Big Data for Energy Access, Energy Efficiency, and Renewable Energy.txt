AUTHOR(S) Lerner, Karin Anna Maria; Dalphond, Zhenia Viatchaninova; Gee,
Matthew; Plagge, Thomas   Energy Analytics for Development: Big Data for Energy
Access, Energy Efficiency, and Renewable Energy With unprecedented speed and
scale, digital transformation is affecting multiple industries, including
energy. A combination of technologies, and a more complex world demanding
greater agility and new competences impact all aspects of the energy sector and
manifest themselves in changing patterns of consumption, new ways of asset
optimization, and cross-industry partnerships. ‘Smart solutions’ are a product
of this transformation and energy data are its source. By nature, the energy
sector generates vast amounts of big data through meters, sensor networks,
customer payments, credit history, satellite imagery, etc. It is not surprising
that private and public energy companies are turning to the idea of leveraging
big data analytics for performance optimization and improved service delivery.
The transition to a digitized energy sector will not happen on its own, and a
number of enablers are required to facilitate this change. Beyond improved
digital infrastructure, digital skills and analytics capabilities will need to
be strengthened. This new solutions brief aims to encourage the use of big data
analytics in the energy sector by outlining opportunities and identifying cases
for where the use of big data analytics could help better address challenges
faced by the energy sector today. Citation Lerner, Karin Anna Maria; Dalphond,
