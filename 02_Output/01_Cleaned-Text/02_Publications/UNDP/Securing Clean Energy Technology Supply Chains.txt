Overview                                                      About this report
Secure, resilient and sustainable energy technology supply chains are central to
successful clean energy transitions. The race to net zero emissions will
redefine global energy security and shift the focus from the supply of fossil
fuels to the supply of the minerals, materials and manufacturing capacity needed
to deliver clean energy technologies. This report,  Securing Clean Energy
Technology Supply Chains,  assesses current and future supply chain needs for
key technologies – including solar PV, batteries for electric vehicles and low
emissions hydrogen – and provides a framework for governments and industry to
identify, assess and respond to emerging opportunities and vulnerabilities. The
IEA highlights five key strategies to build secure, resilient and sustainable
supply chains: Diversify, Accelerate, Innovate, Collaborate and Invest. This
report has been prepared for the  Sydney Energy Forum  on 12-13 July 2022. The
IEA is pleased to co-host the Forum alongside the Australian Government and in
partnership with the Business Council of Australia. The report is a precursor to
the 2023 edition of  Energy Technology Perspectives , an IEA flagship report,
which will present detailed analysis on what is needed to develop and expand a
range of clean energy technology supply chains to achieve net zero emissions.
