Browse by theme                         IRENA’s Critical Materials for the
Energy Transition emphasises that an accelerated energy transition requires a
growing supply of critical materials, with IRENA’s World Energy Transition
Outlook further elaborating on the importance of batteries for the energy
transition. As a key component in the transition, electromobility needs to
become the dominant form of road transportation. Its success depends on the
availability of affordable lithium-ion batteries. Stationary battery
applications will also continue to grow; therefore, lithium supply needs to
expand, and mining and materials processing industries need to be developed at
an accelerated pace in a way that is both environmentally and socially sound.
This technical paper discusses the global lithium industry structure and major
players. The paper examines supply and demand-side outlook, reflects on current
costs changes and their further implications, the role the governments could
play to de-risk lithium supply and delves deeper into the opportunities the
innovation can play in reducing demand growth. Special attention is given to
energy use and the CO2 emissions from lithium production and options for CO2
emissions reduction.         Additional analyses
