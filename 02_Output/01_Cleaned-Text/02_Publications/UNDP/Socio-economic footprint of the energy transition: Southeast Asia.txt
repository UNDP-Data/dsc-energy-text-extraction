Southeast Asia has witnessed impressive economic growth in the past three
decades. Its gross domestic product (GDP), expressed in terms of purchasing
power parity (PPP), has expanded at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
4.7%. Southeast Asia has also made significant progress in social development
and in raising the standard of living for its citizens. However, growth and
development have also placed considerable strain on the existing development
model that must be addressed to safeguard future development and living
standards. This necessitates a new model for the sustainable utilisation of the
region’s natural resources – to which the region’s socio-economic development is
tied. While the past few years have stretched resources and forced a focus on
near-term priorities – especially during the COVID-19 pandemic – the region’s
socio-economic outlook depends on its ability to reshape its own development
narrative. Informed by IRENA’s  World Energy Transitions Outlook  for the
development of a sustainable and cleaner energy system, this report explores the
potential socio-economic impacts of the energy transition in Southeast Asia
under two scenarios. IRENA’s analysis has shown that a comprehensive and more
ambitious energy transition will lead to improved socio-economic outcomes. Under
the 1.5 ° C Scenario, the GDP of Southeast Asia is expected to be 3.4% higher
over the 2021-2050 period than in the Planned Energy Scenario (PES). Greater
household consumption, trade surpluses and international co-operation flows, as
well as higher transition-related investment, are the main drivers of this
difference in GDP outcomes. Southeast Asia is expected to also experience 1.0%
more economy-wide jobs and 10.9% higher social welfare than in the PES over the
2021-2050 period. In the renewable energy sector, the 1.5 ° C Scenario could
boost employment substantially, from around 1.3 million currently to around 3.9
million by 2030 and some 5.1 million (mainly bioenergy and solar technologies)
by 2050. For these benefits to be realised, ASEAN countries will require a
comprehensive policy framework that not only drives forward the energy
transition but also protects people, livelihoods and jobs. The region’s energy
transition policy framework should be holistic to provide clean and sufficient
energy to all, and enable a just transition from fossil-based to renewables-
based economies. Addressing justice and fairness is essential to ensure support
and buy-in by all (including national stakeholders, regional-level actors and
citizens), deliver benefits equitably, leave no one behind, avoid costs falling
disproportionately on disadvantaged groups, and ensure the energy transition
supports rather than counteracts social welfare and equality.   Related content
