Technology Review of Hydrogen Carriers      The report covers transformation
from gaseous hydrogen to a suitable form to allow its transport and storage, its
use in the process of transportation itself and its reconversion from the
carrier back to pure hydrogen.                         ISBN: 978-92-9260-431-8

Hydrogen can be transported over long distances by pipeline or by ship. This
report compares the transport of hydrogen by pipeline as compressed gaseous
hydrogen with three forms used in shipping pathways: ammonia, liquid hydrogen
and liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC). The focus is on hydrogen transport
rather than the transport of commodities made using hydrogen, noting that
ammonia can be both a hydrogen carrier and directly used as a feedstock or fuel
for different applications. Carbon-containing carriers (such as methanol or
methane) are excluded. This is part of a report trilogy focusing on global
hydrogen trade in a 1.5°C scenario in 2050. The report covers transformation
from gaseous hydrogen to a suitable form to allow its transport and storage; its
use in the process of transportation itself; and its reconversion from the
carrier back to pure hydrogen (if needed). Each step of the value chain is
reviewed from a techno-economic perspective including costs and efficiency, and
their potential evolution towards mid-century. Other reports in the trilogy
cover the integration with demand, to assess a scenario for global hydrogen
trade by 2050; and cost and technical potential of green hydrogen supply for
various regions and time horizons under different scenarios and assumptions.
