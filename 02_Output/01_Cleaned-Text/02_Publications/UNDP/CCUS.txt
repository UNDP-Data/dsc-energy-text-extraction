About this report This 2023 update to our  Net Zero Roadmap  surveys the complex
and dynamic energy landscape and sets out an updated pathway to net zero by
2050, taking account of the key developments that have occurred since 2021.

utilisation and storage                        If all announced CO 2  capture
capacity is realised and the             current growth trend continues, global
capacity could reach NZE             levels by 2030. Reducing project lead
times, particularly related to             the development of CO 2
storage, will be critical to achieve those levels.            Capture capacity

Two-thirds of total CO 2  capture is in the emerging                 market and
developing economies                Announced capture and storage capacity
include all facilities with a capacity larger than 0.1 Mt CO2 per year as of
June 2023, and projects with an announced operation date by 2030. Planned
capture capacity shown in the bottom graph excludes capacity for utilisation.
