Browse by theme               Green hydrogen – hydrogen produced from renewable
energy – will play a key role in the energy transition, and particularly in the
decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors. The deployment and uptake of green
hydrogen, and the development of national, regional and international green
hydrogen markets will depend on the establishment and wide acceptance of
tracking systems. Such instruments are necessary to track attributes across the
entire value chain, create transparency, boost demand and encourage
transferability. The IRENA  Coalition for Action  brief on Green Hydrogen
Certification, led by the members of the Decarbonising End-Use Sectors Working
Group, provides an overview of technical considerations for green hydrogen
tracking systems and the challenges that need to be addressed for the creation
of such instruments. In addition, the brief also puts forth key recommendations
to policy makers in order to successfully establish tracking systems for green
hydrogen based on internationally accepted standards.   Additional analyses
