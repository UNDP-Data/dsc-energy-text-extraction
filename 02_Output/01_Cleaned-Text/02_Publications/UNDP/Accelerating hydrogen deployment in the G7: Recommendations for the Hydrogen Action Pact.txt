Accelerating hydrogen deployment in the G7: Recommendations for the Hydrogen
Action Pact   Newsletter    Go Launched by the G7 in May 2022, the Hydrogen
Action Pact (HAP) aims to strengthen joint action on power-to-X (electricity
storage through conversion into hydrogen), hydrogen and derivatives (especially
ammonia), and to streamline the implementation of existing multilateral
initiatives. This report briefly summarises the status and outlook for hydrogen
in each G7 member, including analyses of technology, costs, strategy and stated
policy support for each country, and presents recommendations for accelerating
global hydrogen trade. The report features the outcomes of a cross-strategy
analysis that was conducted to establish trends and common priorities, and
identify differences and misalignments within the G7 membership. It also
identifies the main areas where collaboration among G7 members can make the most
significant difference in advancing hydrogen deployment, and provides specific
recommendations for G7 members in each area. It concludes that G7 countries
should promote the uptake of hydrogen use in hard-to-decarbonise sectors, while
working together on certification, technology, policy making and communication.
