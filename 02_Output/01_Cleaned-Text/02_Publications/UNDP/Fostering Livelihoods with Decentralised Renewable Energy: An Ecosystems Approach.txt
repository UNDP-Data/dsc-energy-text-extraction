Newsletter    Go                   Browse by theme               Decentralised
renewable energy solutions linked to livelihoods is an important step in
maximising the benefits of energy access for socio-economic development.
Renewables offer the opportunity to translate investments in electricity
connections and kilowatt-hours into higher incomes for communities and
enterprises, local jobs, greater adaptive capacity and overall well-being.
Achieving this transformative change requires greater efforts than simply
deploying decentralised systems. It requires investing in an ‘ecosystem’ that
positions the diversity of people’s livelihoods at the centre of energy access
efforts and delivers tailored energy solutions, the financing, capacity and
skills, market access and policy support to realise the full benefits of energy
access. This brief jointly developed by IRENA and SELCO Foundation discusses how
energy access programmes and initiatives are tackling the various ecosystem
components to sustain and strengthen existing livelihood activities or
facilitate new ones. Building on case studies and examples from different
regions and contexts, the brief identifies five key action areas: Consider
productive end uses in energy access plans and strategies Mobilise accessible,
affordable financing for end-users and enterprises Support technology innovation
and adaptation processes Expand incubation support and skills development
Mainstream gender across the ecosystem Investing in an enabling ecosystem will
yield long-term socio-economic dividends underpinned by sustainable livelihoods.
It would also advance efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda, stimulate a more
inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and contribute to a more just
energy system.   Additional analyses                                Renewable
