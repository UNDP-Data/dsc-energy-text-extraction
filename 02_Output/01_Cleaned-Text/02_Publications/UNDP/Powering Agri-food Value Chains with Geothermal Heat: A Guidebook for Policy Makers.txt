The report is also available in Spanish ( español ). Global demand for food and
water is expected to grow by 50% by mid-century, placing increasing pressure on
existing water, energy and food systems. This increase in demand for food
presents an opportunity for clean energy technologies such as geothermal energy
to support the development of “sustainable food systems”. The use of geothermal
heat in the agri-food value chains has several benefits, including increased
food productivity due to growing crops and animals in optimal environments, and
reduced food spoilage due to timely processing, drying/dehydration and cold
storage/refrigeration. Other benefits include empowering women and youth who are
heavily involved in food production, particularly in developing countries, and a
general improvement in the living standards of local communities. This IRENA
report provides recommendations to accelerate the deployment of geothermal
energy in the agri-food sector. It addresses challenges related to inadequate
data on geothermal resources and existing heating demand for agri-food
applications; absent or misaligned enabling framework conditions; inadequate
financing; and lack of awareness. It also highlights case studies for geothermal
agri-food applications from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas and Oceania.
