About this report Space cooling is the fastest-growing use of energy in
buildings globally and in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Electricity use for cooling in buildings across the region has increased
dramatically over the past decades. Yet today, only 15% of households in
Southeast Asia have an air conditioner; fans represent around another 9% of
residential energy use. With continued economic development and population
growth across the region, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that
air conditioner ownership across the ASEAN Member States (AMS) will continue to
grow. This growth could see electricity demand from space cooling in the region
grow to 300 TWh in 2040 – approximately equivalent to the total electricity
consumption of Indonesia and Singapore combined. The  Roadmap towards
Sustainable and Energy-Efficient Space Cooling in ASEAN  focuses on the policy
tools available for AMS to drive energy efficiency improvements for space
cooling. It sets ambitious milestones for space cooling technologies, including
air conditioners and fans, that can help guide the ambitions outlined in this
roadmap and subsequent action across ASEAN. Published April 2022 License CC BY
