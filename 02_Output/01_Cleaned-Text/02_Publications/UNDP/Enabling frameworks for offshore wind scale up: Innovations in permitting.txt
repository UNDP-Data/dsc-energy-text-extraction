Innovations in permitting   Newsletter    Go Offshore wind represents a key
solution in meeting global climate goals, and an increasing number of countries
are turning to this technology to catalyse their sustainable energy transition
efforts. According to IRENA’s  World energy transitions outlook , to remain on
track to meet the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement, nearly 500 GW of global
offshore wind installations will be needed by 2030, while 2 465 GW will be
required by 2050.  To accelerate the rapid deployment of this technology, it is
crucial to facilitate permitting processes for offshore wind projects. Most
permitting protocols in place today involve l engthy processes, and are hampered
by  a lack of central authority; limited digital resources; and scattered
modalities to engage with different stakeholders.  Therefore, IRENA's
Collaborative Framework on Ocean Energy and Offshore Renewables , with the
support of the  Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) , developed this policy brief
to outline actionable solutions to address permitting bottlenecks and accelerate
these processes. The recommendations are also accompanied by several case
studies to demonstrate their practical relevance.   Related content
