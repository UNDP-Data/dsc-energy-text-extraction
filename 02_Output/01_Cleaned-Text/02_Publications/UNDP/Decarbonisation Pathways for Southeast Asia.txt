Overview                                                      About this report
The International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Institute of Energy Economic,
Japan (IEEJ) have developed and published long-term decarbonisation pathways for
Southeast Asia and Indonesia. This paper provides a comparison of modelling
approaches, quantitative drivers, and results from the IEA and IEEJ pathways,
highlighting areas of agreement, as well as identifying and explaining
differences, and thereby to derive implications. The IEA pathway used in the
comparison is the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) from the  World Energy
Outlook 2022  and the  Energy Sector Roadmap to Net Zero Emissions in Indonesia
. The IEEJ pathway is the net zero CO 2  emissions in 2050 or 2060 case
(CN2050/2060) from the  Decarbonisation of ASEAN Energy Systems: Optimum
Technology Selection Model Analysis up to 2060  study. Published April 2023
