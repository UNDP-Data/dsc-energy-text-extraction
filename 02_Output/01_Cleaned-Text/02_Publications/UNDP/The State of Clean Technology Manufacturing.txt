The State of Clean Technology Manufacturing                                 An
Energy Technology Perspectives Special Briefing
Download pdf                             Overview
About this report Technology manufacturing plays a pivotal role in the energy
transition required to meet climate, energy security and economic development
goals. Deploying clean energy technologies at the pace required to put the world
on a trajectory consistent with net zero emissions by mid-century will demand
rapid expansion in manufacturing capacity, underpinned by secure, resilient and
sustainable supply chains for their components and materials. This Energy
Technology Perspectives Special Briefing,  The State of Clean Technology
Manufacturing , provides an update on recent progress in clean energy technology
manufacturing in key regions. It focuses on five technologies – solar PV, wind,
batteries, electrolysers and heat pumps – that will be critical to the energy
transition. Manufacturing capacity for these technologies is expanding rapidly,
driven by supportive policies, ambitious corporate strategies and consumer
demand. The aim is to keep decision makers informed of investment trends and the
impact that recent industrial strategies are having in these highly dynamic
sectors.  This special briefing was produced to support deliberations at the
2023 G7 Leaders’ Summit in Hiroshima, Japan, from 19-21 May 2023. It builds on
analysis in the latest edition of the IEA’s flagship technology publication,
Energy Technology Perspectives 2023 (ETP-2023) , published in January 2023, to
take into account the latest announced expansions in manufacturing capacity. 
This report is part of the IEA’s support of the first global stocktake of the
Paris Agreement, which will be finalized in the run up to COP28, the next UN
Climate Change Conference, at the end of 2023. Find other reports in this series
