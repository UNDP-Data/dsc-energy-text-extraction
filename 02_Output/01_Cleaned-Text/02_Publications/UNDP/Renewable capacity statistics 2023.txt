International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) produces comprehensive statistics
on a range of topics related to renewable energy. This publication presents
renewable power generation capacity statistics for the past decade (2013-2022)
in trilingual tables. See the latest  Renewable Capacity Highlights . Data sets
are also available in French ( Français ) and Spanish ( Español ). Renewable
power generation capacity is measured as the maximum net generating capacity of
power plants and other installations that use renewable energy sources to
produce electricity. For most countries and technologies, the data reflects the
capacity installed and connected at the end of the calendar year. Data has been
obtained from a variety of sources, including an IRENA questionnaire, official
national statistics, industry association reports, other reports and news
articles. IRENA gratefully acknowledges the support of national correspondents,
national and international industry associations for their help in compiling
this dataset. The  previous edition  spanned the years 2012-2021. The complete
dataset from the year 2000 onwards is available for download on  Data and
Statistics  web pages.   Related content                                  North
