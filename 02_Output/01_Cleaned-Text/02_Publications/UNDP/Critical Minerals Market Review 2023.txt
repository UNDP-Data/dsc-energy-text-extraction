About this report The inaugural edition of the  Critical Minerals Market Review
provides a major update on the investment, market, technology and policy trends
of the critical minerals sector in 2022 and an initial reading of the emerging
picture for 2023. Through in-depth analyses of clean energy and mineral market
trends, this report assesses the progress made by countries and businesses in
scaling up future supplies, diversifying sources of supply, and improving
sustainable and responsible practices. It also examines major trends for
individual minerals and discusses key policy implications. The report will be
followed by a forthcoming analysis that will feature comprehensive demand and
supply projections for key materials and a number of deep-dives on key issues.
It also makes available an online tool, the  Critical Minerals Data Explorer ,
which allow users to explore interactively the latest IEA projections. Published

Implications read Read online In its first release, this dataset provides demand
projection results for 37 key metals and minerals that are critical to the clean
energy sector under different scenarios and technology cases, including 12
alternative cases modelling the impact of different technologies or consumer
behaviours. The numbers will be regularly updated to align with the latest
energy projections in line with the IEA's  Global Energy and Climate model .
Long-term supply projection data will also be added at a later stage.
