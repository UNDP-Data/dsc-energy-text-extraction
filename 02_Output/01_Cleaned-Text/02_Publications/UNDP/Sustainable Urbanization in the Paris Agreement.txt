Sustainable Urbanization in the Paris Agreement’ – a comparative review of
Nationally Determined Contributions for Urban Content”, a UN-Habitat publication
coming on the heels of Habitat III, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
and COP22. The adoption of the New Urban Agenda (NUA) on 20 October 2016, and
the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change two weeks later,
on 4 November 2016, are a strong first step toward the immediate implementation
of Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, in urban- and climate change related
matters. In this final version of the publication, UN-Habitat analyzes the
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) towards the Paris Agreement on
Climate Change, with a special focus on the urban context, in order to
understand better the roles of member states in urban climate action. The result
is very encouraging: over two-thirds – 113 out of 164 – of the submitted NDCs
show clear urban references and content, establishing the relationship between
sustainable urbanization and climate action. Through the New Urban Agenda and
the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, UN-Habitat stands ready to support member
states to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). About us
