Towards a Circular Steel Industry      Achieving a circular steel sector
requires improved material and process efficiency; increased steel recycling;
and the adoption of renewable energy sources for steel production. This report
provides a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and opportunities associated
with improving circularity in the sector.                         ISBN:

Circular Steel Industry   Newsletter    Go Steel, a vital material for human
societies, enables progress in various sectors. However, the steel industry
contributes about 7% of global carbon dioxide emissions due to its reliance on
fossil fuels. The circular economy for steel can mitigate the detrimental
impacts that arise from the steel industry. This report, prepared by the
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in close collaboration with
India's Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, aims to facilitate
the discussion on a circular steel industry under India's G20 Presidency. The
report delves into the key factors that contribute to the environmental impact
of the iron and steel sector and provides a comprehensive analysis of the
challenges and opportunities associated with improving circularity. Achieving a
circular steel sector requires improved material and process efficiency;
increased steel recycling; and the adoption of renewable energy sources for
steel production. This report recommends international dialogue, co-operation
and collaboration to pivot toward a more resource-efficient, low-carbon,
environmentally sustainable steel industry.   Related content
