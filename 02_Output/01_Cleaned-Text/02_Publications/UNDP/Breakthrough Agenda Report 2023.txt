The 2023 edition of an annual collaboration between the International Energy
Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the United
Nations Climate Change High-Level Champions assesses progress toward meeting
international climate goals.                         September 2023 Home >

The 2023 edition of the Breakthrough Agenda Report examines the advances made
and actions needed to deliver the Breakthrough Agenda - a clean technology
commitment signed by 48 countries at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021. The annual
process aims to align actions by countries to reduce emissions, scale up
investment and drive down clean technology costs across key sectors: power; road
transport; steel; hydrogen; agriculture; and, for the first time in 2023,
buildings and cement. Collectively, these seven sectors account for more than
60% of global GHG emissions. This second edition of the report shows that
current efforts on clean energy and sustainable solutions are not delivering the
levels of investment and deployment required to meet international climate
goals; and calls on governments to strengthen collaboration in key areas – such
as standards and regulation, financial and technical assistance and market
creation – to turbocharge the transition.   By providing a practical roadmap for
more effective international collaboration, the report sets out a series of
recommendations for each sector to help reduce emissions over the next decade
and stave off the worst effects of climate change. The guidance spans finance,
research and development, demand-side adoption, supporting infrastructure and
public engagement. Shared commitments to net zero emission targets across the
seven sectors will help direct investment and accelerate cost reductions in
clean energy technologies, according to the report. Moreover, co-ordinated
deployment, facilitated by international collaboration, can help create the
economies of scale required to bring down the price of crucial clean energy
technologies and sustainable agriculture solutions.   Related content
