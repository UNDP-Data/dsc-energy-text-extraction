About this report Renewables are growing rapidly in the electricity systems
around the world as countries seek to improve their energy security, meet
emission reduction targets and take advantage of cheaper electricity sources.
Thanks to successful use of flexibility resources – from stronger grids and
interconnections to demand-side measures, affordable storage and dispatchable
power supply – many countries have already securely and efficiently integrated
significant shares of variable renewables (VRE) in their electricity generation.
As wind and solar continue to grow as a proportion of generation, system level
surpluses and periods of lower generation will eventually expand beyond hour-to-
hour or daily variations to seasonal timescales. Addressing seasonal variability
of renewables means that flexibility resources will be needed to varying extents
throughout the year, even on a week-to-week or month-to-month basis. The present
study, produced in support of Japan’s G7 Presidency, explores the integration of
VRE beyond 70% share of annual generation in future power systems, focussing on
four different climatic regions: Temperate with hot summer, Tropical, cold Arid
and Continental with warm summer. The study confirms that a mix of flexibility
resources is needed to manage variability across all timescales and seasons. In
particular, systems with very high level of VRE require seasonal flexibility
services, which can be provided from existing thermal power capacities and from
hydropower plants. Eventually, as energy systems transition towards net zero
emissions, all flexibility services will need to be fully decarbonised.
