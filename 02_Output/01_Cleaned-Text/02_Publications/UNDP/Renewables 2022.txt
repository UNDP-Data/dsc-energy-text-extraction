About this report Renewables 2022 is the IEA’s primary analysis on the sector,
based on current policies and market developments. It forecasts the deployment
of renewable energy technologies in electricity, transport and heat to 2027
while also exploring key challenges to the industry and identifying barriers to
faster growth. The current global energy crisis brings both new opportunities
and new challenges for renewable energy. Renewables 2022 provides analysis on
the new policies introduced in response to the energy crisis. This year’s report
frames current policy and market dynamics while placing the recent rise in
energy prices and energy security challenges in context. In addition to its
detailed market analysis and forecasts, Renewables 2022 also examines key
developments and trends for the sector, including the more ambitious renewable
energy targets recently proposed by the European Union; the issue of windfall
profits; the diversification of solar PV manufacturing; renewable capacity for
hydrogen production; and a possible feedstock crunch in the biofuels industry
and viable ways to avoid it. Published December 2022 License CC BY 4.0 Press
