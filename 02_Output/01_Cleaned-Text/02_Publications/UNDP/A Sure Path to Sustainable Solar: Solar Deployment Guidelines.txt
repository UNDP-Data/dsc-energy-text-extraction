Sustainable Solar: Solar Deployment Guidelines English  |  French Achieving
global goals for access to energy and mitigation of climate change will require
a quadrupling of present levels of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation in the
developing world by 2025 to reach around 950 gigawatt (GW). This represents an
investment of more than US$500 billion in new solar PV generation alone. To
reach this objective, large amounts of private funding will have to be unlocked
to complement the limited public financing available. Yet most developing
countries still lack a pipeline of bankable solar projects for consideration by
the private sector. To develop one, countries must take a series of key steps to
tackle critical risks perceived by the private sector while also minimizing
risks for the public sector. The World Bank, Energy Sector Management Assistance
Program in partnership with, Agence Française de Développement (AFD),
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and International Solar Alliance
(ISA) developed the Solar Risk Mitigation Initiative (SRMI or “the Initiative”)
to address these challenges. SRMI aims to support countries in developing
sustainable solar programs that will attract private investments and so reduce
reliance on public finances. The report details each step to be taken to develop
an effective program, highlighting links between each step and other critical
matters that should be considered along the way to ensure an integrated
approach. The guidelines also include a diagnostic tool that countries can use
to benchmark their progress in fulfilling the conditions for a sustainable solar
program. The main conclusion of the pipeline assessment is that few countries
have completed the preliminary work necessary to mount a sustainable solar
program. English  |  French For more information on SRMI, read the brief:
