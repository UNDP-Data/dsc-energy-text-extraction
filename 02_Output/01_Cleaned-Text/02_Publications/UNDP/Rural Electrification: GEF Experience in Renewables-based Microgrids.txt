Topics Knowledge & Learning Renewable Energy and Energy Access This paper
discusses how the existing 1.2 billion poor people worldwide without access to
electricity can be environment-friendly electrified with the implementation of
the UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) on energy and the 2015 Paris
Agreement on climate change. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the
experience of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) in rural electrification
with renewable energy-based microgrids or mini-grids, and identify challenges
and business opportunities in rural electrification in the least developed
countries (LDCs). Several case studies are presented to show GEF’s strategies of
financing renewable energy-based microgrids. This paper concludes that (1) with
the demonstrated evidence of the importance of new technologies for renewable
energy-based microgrids, it is necessary to improve enabling environments for
creating markets conducive to the new technologies; (2) project investment is a
necessary first step, but for success to be fully realized, catalyzing follow-on
investments should also be set as an important goal; and (3) investments need to
include effective technology transfer components for renewable energy-based
microgrid technologies. Follow Us GEF Affiliated Sites GEF Portal Independent
