The cost of financing for renewable power      Based on a new, unique dataset
from a global survey, this IRENA report presents unprecedented insights on the
cost of capital for onshore wind, offshore wind and solar photovoltaic (PV)
projects.                         ISBN: 978-92-9260-530-8 May 2023     Appendix

Newsletter    Go The cost of capital (CoC) for renewable power generation
technologies is a major determinant of the total price to purchasers of
renewable electricity. Both reliable data, and a deep understanding of the
composition of the CoC and its drivers, are therefore critical information.
Crucially, even small differences in the CoC that are not properly accounted for
can result in misleading cost calculations and lead to poor policy making. This
IRENA report presents new cost of capital data, obtained from an expert survey
and interviews covering all major regions for onshore wind, offshore wind and
solar photovoltaic (PV). The coverage of this survey is believed to be
unprecedented in terms of its geographical and technological breadth; as such,
the results may represent the most wide-ranging database on renewable energy
financing available today. The report fills a key information gap by providing
greater understanding of the composition of the CoC and its drivers to assist
policy makers in developing effective approaches to support the energy
transition that reflect technology and country risks, and help support energy
analysts/modellers seeking accurate cost estimates. In addition to the report,
the associated  Data appendix  features cost of capital data for solar PV,
onshore and offshore wind for 100 countries, benchmarked from the survey data.
