term energy scenarios and low-emission development strategies: Stocktaking and
alignment   Newsletter    Go Long-term energy scenarios (LTES) are a vital
planning tool for guiding the energy system to a clean, sustainable and
increasingly renewable-based future. Following COP21 in Paris in 2015, countries
have also begun to develop long-term low greenhouse gas emission development
strategies (LT-LEDS) to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with
the structural transformations needed to reach carbon neutrality and meet the
targets of the Paris Agreement. As of October 2022, 36 out of the 53 LT-LEDS
published have featured scenarios as their main tool to outline alternative
pathways and targets and to quantitively assess the short- and medium-term
policies needed to reach their long-term targets. This report aims to explore
the processes behind the development of scenarios in energy planning
publications and scenario-based LT-LEDS, and the alignment between these two
processes. It is a publication of the  LTES Network , of which the UNFCCC is a
technical partner, and aims to complement the  UNFCCC’s synthesis report on LT-
LEDS . The report provides a comparative analysis of 24 LTES and 36 scenario-
based LT-LEDS from a total of 45 countries. It considers the institutional and
governance framework in which LTES and scenario-based LT-LEDS publications are
developed, including the level of institutional coordination, stakeholder
consultation, type of publication, and highlights from these publications.
Additionally, it assesses the coverage of energy transition elements included in
the scenarios of these publications (ranging from renewable generation and end-
use sectors to mineral constraints and job impacts). The report concludes by
highlighting the advantage of basing LT-LEDS on scenarios, making the policy
recommendations more robust, facilitating communication of the outcomes with
stakeholders, and increasing implementation potential. It also provides
recommendations on how to improve institutional alignment between LTES and
scenario-based LT-LEDS and expand the scope of the scenarios to better reflect
the realities of the energy transition.   Additional analyses
