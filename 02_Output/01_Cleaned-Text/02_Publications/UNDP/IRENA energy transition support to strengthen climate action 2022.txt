International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) assists its Members and other
countries in their efforts to achieve a global energy transition powered by
renewables. Increasingly, Members and countries have identified renewable energy
in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Long-Term Low Greenhouse
Gas Emission Development Strategies. The Agency provides support to enhance the
ambition of countries’ climate commitments and to effectively implement national
climate action policies and plans. IRENA has engaged with 83 Parties to the 2015
Paris Agreement to support their efforts to enhance their climate pledges and
implement the climate action plan. This engagement covers a total population of
two billion people with a carbon footprint of four billion tonnes of carbon
dioxide equivalent. This report highlights the ongoing and previous work of the
Agency to support countries through its various work packages, including those
concerned with project development, financing and investment, while the Annex of
the reports lists support and climate action commitments for individual
countries.   Additional analyses                                Tripling
