Overview                                                      About this report
Energy demand for space cooling has increased more than twice as fast as the
overall energy demand in buildings over the last decade. Higher temperatures
caused by climate change, coupled with increasing incomes and growing
populations, are driving rapid growth in residential air conditioning (AC)
ownership. Yet, of the 3.5 billion people who live in hot climates, only about
15% owned AC in 2021, with even lower ownership levels in Sub-Saharan Africa and
South Asia. Lack of access to indoor cooling puts much of the global population
at high risk for heat stress, adversely affecting thermal comfort, labour
productivity, and human health. Between 2002-2004 and 2019-2021, the average
annual number of heat-related deaths among people aged 65 years or older
increased by 61%, reaching an estimated 300 000 or more deaths. Nevertheless,
access to effective cooling has saved tens of thousands of lives; over the same
period, the average annual number of heat-related deaths averted by AC increased
3-fold, reaching an estimated 190 000 lives saved per year during 2019-2021.
However, the rapid growth of AC is putting stress on the power grid, whilst
exacerbating the adverse impact of space cooling on GHG emissions, local air
pollution, power outages, urban heat island effects, energy poverty, and
physiological acclimatisation. This analysis examines available technical and
policy response measures that are a win-win: they can ensure that lower income
households are not left behind, and that growth in space cooling does not cause
harm to the climate and health. This work is the result of a long-standing
collaboration between  Yale University  and the IEA within the context of the
reports of the  Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change . Published March
