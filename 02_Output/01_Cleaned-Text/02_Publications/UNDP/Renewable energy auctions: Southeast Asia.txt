Newsletter    Go Renewable energy auctions have become a popular instrument for
the deployment of renewables around the world, and Southeast Asia is no
exception. Within the region, however, countries have different contexts and
starting points, and auction design elements and outcomes have varied greatly.
Experience in Southeast Asia shows that the success of auctions greatly depends
on clear, transparent and accessible information regarding auction documentation
and bidding procedures. It also demonstrates that, when setting qualification
requirements, finding a balance between screening out bidders that may
underperform and attracting enough players to bid to benefit from competition is
key. Local content rules have been introduced as pre-requisites for
participating in the auction or as criteria for the selection of winners. Such
measures can be important tools to support the development of domestic renewable
energy industries, even if they may result in higher prices, at least on the
short term. The development of local industries has been a priority in the
region, especially for solar PV, with large potential for innovation and job
creation.   Additional analyses                                Malaysia energy
