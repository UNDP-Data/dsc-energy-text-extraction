About this report Energy Efficiency 2022  is the IEA’s primary annual analysis
on global developments in energy efficiency markets and policy. It explores
recent trends in energy intensity, demand and efficiency-related investment,
innovation, policy and technology while also discussing key questions facing
policy makers.  This year record-high consumer energy bills and securing
reliable access to supply are urgent political and economic imperatives for
almost all governments. In response to the energy crisis countries are
prioritising energy efficiency action due to its ability to simultaneously meet
affordability, supply security and climate goals. While efficiency investment
has recently been increasing to reach new record levels, the pace of global
energy intensity improvements had noticeably slowed in the second half of the
last decade and virtually stalled during the first two years of Covid-19. With
efforts to better manage energy consumption as a result of the crisis increasing
the rate of improvement once more, the question as to whether 2022 will see a
sustained efficiency turning point, and what more can be done, are key themes of
this year’s report.  language English chevron-down Language Close dialog English
