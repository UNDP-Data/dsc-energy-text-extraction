Hydrogen Cost and Potential      This report estimates the potential for green
hydrogen production as a function of land availability, considering exclusion
zones such as protected areas, forests, wetlands, urban centres, slope and water
scarcity.                         ISBN: 978-92-9260-432-5 May 2022 Home >

Goal: Green Hydrogen Cost and Potential   Newsletter    Go
Browse by theme               Hydrogen is an essential component of a net zero
energy system and has a key role to play in decarbonising sectors that are
difficult to electrify, such as heavy industry and long-haul transport. Vast
green hydrogen potential exists around the world, equating to more than 20 times
global primary energy demand in 2050. However, the potential within specific
countries or regions depends on the land available. This report estimates the
potential for green hydrogen production as a function of land availability,
considering exclusion zones such as protected areas, forests, wetlands, urban
centres, slope and water scarcity. It forms part of a series of three reports
focusing on global hydrogen trade in a 1.5°C scenario in 2050. The higher cost
of green hydrogen compared to fossil fuels has posed a significant challenge to
the deployment of green hydrogen. Various time horizons and scenarios are
therefore explored in this report. In the most optimistic scenario, production
costs could reach levels of USD 0.65/kgH 2  by 2050 in the best locations, while
reaching levels of USD 1.15/kgH 2  in less optimistic cost assumptions. Part I:
