About this report This 2023 update to our  Net Zero Roadmap  surveys the complex
and dynamic energy landscape and sets out an updated pathway to net zero by
2050, taking account of the key developments that have occurred since 2021.

cumulative emissions reductions            Bioenergy             While
traditional use of biomass is phased out in the NZE Scenario,             modern
bioenergy use more than doubles to 2050, due to its ability             to be
used as a direct drop-in substitute for fossil fuels. Advanced
feedstock supply grows considerably, supported by investments and
commercialisation of advanced conversion technologies.            Bioenergy
