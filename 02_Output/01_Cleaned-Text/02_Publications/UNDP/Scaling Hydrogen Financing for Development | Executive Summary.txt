February 20 2024 AUTHOR(S) ESMAP, OECD, GIF, Hydrogen Council   Scaling Hydrogen
Financing for Development This report unveils a unique and in-depth proposal to
transform ideas into attractive investment projects. It highlights how policy
and financial risk mitigation mechanisms play a critical role in slashing the
funding gap and reducing the cost of hydrogen generation. The findings promise
to boost clean hydrogen lighthouse projects to revolutionize this multi-billion-
dollar industry, so that emerging markets and developing countries can
successfully participate in this nascent sector. DOWNLOAD  Report Overview   The
full report will be available in late December. Citation Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), Global Infrastructure Facility, and Hydrogen Council.
