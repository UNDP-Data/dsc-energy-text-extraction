Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) produces comprehensive, reliable datasets on
renewable energy capacity and use worldwide.  Renewable energy statistics 2023
provides datasets on power-generation capacity for 2013-2022, actual power
generation for 2013-2021 and renewable energy balances for over 150 countries
and areas for 2020-2021. Data was obtained from a variety of sources, including
an IRENA questionnaire, official national statistics, industry association
reports, consultant reports and news articles. Major trends in the sector
worldwide are outlined in the accompanying brief,  Renewable energy highlights .
The yearbook also includes statistics on investments in renewables, compiled
from the OECD-DAC database and 20 major multi-lateral, bilateral and national
development financial institutions, spanning 2012-2021. The investment data is
presented in millions of United States dollars (USD million) at 2020 prices.
Data on renewable power capacity represents the maximum net generating capacity
of power plants and other installations that use renewable energy sources to
produce electricity. For most countries and technologies, the data reflects the
capacity installed and connected at the end of the calendar year. Capacity is
presented in megawatts (MW), while generation is presented in gigawatt-hours
(GWh). Pumped storage, although included as part of hydropower data, is excluded
from total renewable energy. Electricity generation and capacity datasets from
the year 2000 onwards are also available through a dashboard on IRENA’s  Data &
Statistics  page.   Related content                                  North
