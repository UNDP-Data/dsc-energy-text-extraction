Renewable energy benefits: Leveraging local capacity for small-scale hydropower
Newsletter    Go In the pursuit of a sustainable energy future, small-scale
hydropower is emerging as a transformative force with the potential to
revolutionise the energy landscape while strengthening local capacities and
capabilities. This new comprehensive study focuses on the entire value chain of
small-scale hydropower, from production and installation to operation. It
highlights the critical role of human resources and skills, enabling informed
decisions on domestic value creation opportunities to pave the way for a
brighter, more sustainable future. The report also underscores the direct link
between small-scale hydropower deployment and the betterment of local
livelihoods, as well as its potential to empower communities, preserve
watersheds and fortify collective resilience to climate change.   Related
