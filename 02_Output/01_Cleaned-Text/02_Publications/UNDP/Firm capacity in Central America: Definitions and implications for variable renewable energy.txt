Definitions and implications for variable renewable energy      Firm capacity
assesses the contribution of a power plant to meeting demand during critical
conditions. This report explores the key factors that affect the estimation of a
more equitable firm capacity valuation in Central America that reflects the
financial viability of variable renewable energy projects, providing experiences
and best practices from regional and international perspectives.

Spanish (Español) Worldwide, firm capacity is a commercial attribute that
generators can use as a trade asset in an electricity market, or offer as a
guarantee to the system in exchange for a regulated payment - the signing of
long-term contracts with distribution companies and large consumers is also an
option for commercialisation. Rising concerns among project developers and
investors in the Central America region relate to a quickly saturating power
market, the limited ability to trade into the regional market, and purchase
power agreements (PPAs) for wind and solar PV that vary extensively from country
to country. The regulatory component of IRENA’s  Clean Energy Corridor of
Central America (CECCA)  initiative focuses on assessing solar and wind PPAs to
ensure a level playing field for renewables vis-à-vis conventional generation,
given that current frameworks appear to offer limited investment incentives for
variable renewable energy (VRE). To support this work, IRENA developed this
report to provide an overview on the use of firm capacity across countries in
the region and for contracting power generated by renewables.   Related content
