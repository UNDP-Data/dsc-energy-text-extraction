Unveiling of State-of-the-Art Energy Efficiency Lab for a Sustainable Future
October 16, 2023         Inauguration of the lab by UNDP Deputy Resident
Representative, Sergio Valdini and Director of Human Resources, Administration
and Management Ministry of Energy, Bahati Mtono    UNDP/EE                 On
Friday, October 13, 2023, a significant milestone was reached in Tanzania's
pursuit of sustainable and efficient energy solutions. The European Union (EU),
in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the
Ministry of Energy (MoE), proudly inaugurated a cutting-edge energy efficiency
laboratory at the Tanzania Industrial Research and Development Organization
(TIRDO). This state-of-the-art laboratory is poised to play a pivotal role in
practical education and energy auditing services for industries, commercial
buildings, and households alike. Its establishment aligns with the objectives
set forth in Tanzania's 1st Energy Efficiency Action Plan, an initiative
designed to ensure equitable access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and
modern energy for all in Tanzania. The dynamic implementation of this plan is
spearheaded by the MoE and UNDP, with invaluable support from the EU. Ms. Bahati
C. Mtono, Director of Human Resources, Administration, and Management at the
Ministry of Energy, expressed her enthusiasm about the laboratory's
capabilities, stating, "The laboratory is equipped with state-of-the-art energy
efficiency technologies, including energy monitoring and analysis systems,
energy modeling software, and energy efficiency testing equipment." She further
emphasised its dual purpose, noting, "The laboratory will be used to train
Tanzanian professionals in the field of energy efficiency and to provide energy
auditing services to Tanzanian businesses and organisations." Within the broader
context of the 'Energy Efficiency Action Plan,' one of the core tasks of this
project involves the development and implementation of a framework for the
management of large energy consumers. This strategic endeavour forms an
essential part of the action plan, with the objective of enhancing national
capacity in energy management and audit. This capacity-building effort will pave
the way for the adoption of optimal energy management practices, leading to
significant advantages such as energy savings, cost reductions, and a reduction
in carbon emissions.     UNDP/EE       Mr. Sergio Valdini, UNDP Deputy Resident
Representative, spoke glowingly of the professionals involved in the initiative,
citing previous successful collaborations such as the pilot energy audit and
management program at PSSSF, Aga Khan Hospital, and Silafrica Ltd. He
highlighted the transformative impact of these efforts, leading to substantial
savings in energy expenses and setting a precedent for future projects. In his
remarks, Mr. Lamine Diallo, Head of Natural Resources at the EU Delegation to
Tanzania, underscored the European Union's commitment to supporting Tanzania in
its journey towards a clean and sustainable energy future. He lauded the
significance of the energy efficiency laboratory in this endeavour. Furthermore,
in collaboration with the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited, Dar es
Salaam Institute of Technology, and UNDP, TIRDO conducted a pilot study earlier
this year. This study focused on energy analysis, evaluation, and the
implementation of energy efficiency measures and conservation measures in three
selected pilot study areas in Dar es Salaam. In addition to these
accomplishments, the project has empowered TIRDO employees with international
training, both in the classroom and through field-based experiences. These
training efforts have culminated in certifications that enable them to serve as
certified energy auditors and managers, further enriching the pool of expertise
dedicated to advancing Tanzania's energy efficiency objectives. In closing, the
inauguration of the energy efficiency laboratory signifies a substantial stride
towards a more sustainable and energy-efficient future for Tanzania. It
exemplifies the collaborative efforts of the European Union, the United Nations
Development Programme, and the Ministry of Energy in driving positive change and
fostering a greener and more prosperous tomorrow.
