guide to design   Newsletter    Go Recent geopolitical and climate-related
developments reiterate the need for immediate action to increase ambition for
renewable energy deployment to achieve climate goals, increase energy security
and improve affordability, as well as to ensure universal access to reliable and
affordable energy. This report sets out to support governments in designing
renewable energy targets that can help achieve these pressing objectives. The
report presents an overview of the latest updates in climate commitments made
ahead of COP27, focusing on the renewable energy targets in NDCs. The analysis
illustrates the existing mismatch between renewable targets in NDCs and those
set in national energy plans, after presenting the latest trends in targets and
an analysis of the level of ambition in renewable power targets globally.
Finally, the report provides guidance on designing targets to achieve policy
objectives related to the climate and beyond, within the specific contexts of
jurisdictions, including resource availability, the level of development of the
renewable energy sector and necessary infrastructure, and the future energy mix.
