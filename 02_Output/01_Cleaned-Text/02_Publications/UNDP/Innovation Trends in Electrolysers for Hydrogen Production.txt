Browse by theme               Electrolysis of water, using renewable
electricity, is the sustainable option to produce green hydrogen as an
attractive low-carbon energy carrier. To respond to the growing demand for
renewables-based hydrogen, an extraordinary expansion of the market for
electrolysers is needed linked to a significant capacity increase in the
manufacture and deployment of electrolysers. A rapid reduction in electrolyser
system costs is essential and technology innovation is crucial to this end.
According to IRENA, investment costs for electrolyser plants can be reduced by
40% in the short term and 80% in the long term through key strategies such as
improved electrolyser design and construction, economies of scale, replacing
scarce materials with abundant metals, increasing efficiency and flexibility of
operations, and learning rates with high technology deployment aligned with a
1.5˚C climate target.  This patent insight report on innovation trends in
electrolysers for hydrogen production, jointly prepared by the European Patent
Office (EPO) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), uses patent
statistics to reveal the trends and dynamism in the exciting field of green
hydrogen that can be produced using renewable electricity via electrolysis. With
its charts and commentary, the report is useful to policymakers, technologists,
companies, and investors wanting to better understand these rapidly expanding
technology domains. An online dashboard with interactive graphs can be accessed
