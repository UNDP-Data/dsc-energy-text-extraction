Renewable Energy in Sri lanka                          The Government of Sri
Lanka has set ambitious energy targets to meet by 2030 to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. UNDP in Sri Lanka is supporting the country to achieve these targets
by  connecting China and Sri Lanka to exchange expertise in renewable energy
technology transfer.  Based on China’s expertise in climate change mitigation,
this 2-year South-South project will support the  transition to sustainable
energy uses in the agro-industry sector.           Related Materials Prodoc
