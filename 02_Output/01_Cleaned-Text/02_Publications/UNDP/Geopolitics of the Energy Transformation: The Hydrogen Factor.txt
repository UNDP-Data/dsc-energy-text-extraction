in Arabic ( عربي ), Chinese ( 中文 ), French ( français ), Russian ( русский ) and
Spanish ( español ). As countries around the world rally behind net zero
targets, hydrogen is increasingly seen as a missing piece of the energy
transformation puzzle to decarbonise harder-to-abate sectors. The possible
pathway on which hydrogen might evolve still involves many uncertainties. With
the growing momentum to establish a global hydrogen market comes the need for a
deeper understanding of its broader effects, including geopolitical aspects.
IRENA has carried out an in-depth analysis of the geopolitics of hydrogen as
part of the work of the  Collaborative Framework on the Geopolitics of Energy
Transformation  (CF-GET). The report builds on IRENA’s substantial body of work
in hydrogen and benefits from a wide range of expert input in the fields of
energy and geopolitics. This report considers whether and how hydrogen may
disrupt future energy systems, reflecting on many of the key themes discussed in
the Global Commission’s report,  A New World – The Geopolitics of the Energy
Transformation . The analysis offers insights into how countries and
stakeholders can navigate the uncertainties and shape the development of
hydrogen markets, and outlines policy considerations to help mitigate the
geopolitical risks and capitalise on opportunities. Some of the key findings of
the report include: Hydrogen is part of a much bigger energy transition picture,
and its development and deployment strategies should not be considered in
isolation. Setting the right priorities for hydrogen use will be essential for
its rapid scale-up and long-term contribution to decarbonisation efforts. The
2020s could become the era of a big race for technology leadership, as costs are
likely to fall sharply with learning and scaling-up of needed infrastructure.
Equipment manufacturing offers an opportunity to capture value in the coming
years and decades. Hydrogen trade and investment flows will spawn new patterns
of interdependence and bring shifts in bilateral relations. Countries with an
abundance of low-cost renewable power could become producers of green hydrogen,
with commensurate geoeconomic and geopolitical consequences. Hydrogen could be
an attractive avenue for fossil fuel exporters to help diversify their economies
and develop new export industries. Supporting the advancement of renewable
energy and green hydrogen in developing countries is critical for decarbonising
the energy system and can contribute to global equity and stability.
International co-operation will be necessary to devise a transparent hydrogen
market with coherent standards and norms that contribute to climate change
efforts meaningfully. The Annex containing the summary of the results of the
geopolitics of hydrogen surveys of experts and IRENA member states is available
