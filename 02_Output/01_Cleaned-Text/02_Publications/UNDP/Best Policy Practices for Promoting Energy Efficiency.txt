Политика повышения энергоэффективности: передовой опыт A Structured Framework of
Best Practices in Policies to Promote Energy Efficiency for Climate Change
Mitigation and Sustainable Development UNECE Energy Series 43 This report sets
forth a suite of existing energy efficiency policies that stand out as best
practices. The policies identified in this report include exemplars of best
practices in energy efficiency policies from around the globe, drawn from
respected and objective policy evaluations and databases.  The primary audience
is policy makers from the member States of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (ECE), though this exploration of best practices should be
useful in other regions. For countries starting to develop energy efficiency
programmes, the policies outlined offer guidance into what works and can offer
confidence when exploring and selecting options. For countries with established
and proficient energy efficiency programmes, this report can assist by
validating policies and offering a set of policy benchmarks.  ABOUT UNECE
