report translations:               Chinese (中文) In order to achieve the
collective goal to secure a carbon-neutral future, the global energy transition
focuses not only on how energy is produced but also, importantly, on how it is
consumed; both supply and demand must be simultaneously transformed to deliver
the efficient and effective decarbonisation of the entire system. Innovation in
end-use sectors is therefore integral to the transition. On the supply side,
wind and solar technologies have experienced rapid growth in recent years,
making substantial amounts of clean electricity available to power systems;
IRENA’s 2019 report,  Innovation landscape for a renewable-powered future ,
mapped 30 key innovations for integrating high shares of variable renewable
electricity in power systems. However, the demand side has not evolved in
parallel. Today, the transport and heating sectors continue to largely rely on
fossil fuels; yet, both direct and indirect electrification with renewable power
now provide feasible solutions to electrify many end-use sectors, thanks to the
sharp cost reductions for wind and solar technologies. See the visual story:
How to decarbonise end-use sectors with renewable power? This report presents
key innovations that can form the basis of smart electrification strategies.
These strategies offer cost-effective decarbonisation pathways to electrify end-
use sectors, increase system flexibility and incorporate large shares of
renewable energy in power systems. The report offers pathways to end-use
electrification in the areas of power to mobility; power to heat and cooling;
and power to hydrogen. These are based on 100 key innovations, categorised
within four dimensions: (i) technology and infrastructure; (ii) market design
and regulation; (iii) system planning and operation; and (iv) business models.
