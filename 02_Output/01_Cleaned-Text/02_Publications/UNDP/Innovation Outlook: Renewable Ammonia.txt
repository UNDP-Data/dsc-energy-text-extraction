Renewable Ammonia      This IRENA-AEA joint report provides a detailed overview
of renewable ammonia in contrast to conventional and fossil-based ammonia with
carbon mitigation.                         ISBN: 978-92-9260-423-3 May 2022 Home

Go                   Browse by theme               Ammonia is one of the seven
basic chemicals used to produce all other chemical products. It is the second
most produced chemical by mass, after sulphuric acid. Around four-fifths of all
ammonia is used to produce nitrogen fertilisers, such as urea and ammonium
nitrate; as such, it supports food production for around half of the global
population. While renewable ammonia’s use as a carbon-free fuel and hydrogen
carrier has been proposed, this has not yet been implemented at significant
scale. Renewable ammonia has been produced at an industrial scale using
hydropower since 1920; however, most ammonia today is produced from natural gas
(72%) and coal (22%). Jointly developed by the International Renewable Energy
Agency (IRENA) and the Ammonia Energy Association (AEA), this report provides a
detailed overview of renewable ammonia in contrast to conventional and fossil-
based ammonia with carbon mitigation, and includes a review of the current
technology status and outlook. The ammonia production industry produces annual
emissions of 0.5 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), representing around
1% of global CO 2  emissions and 15-20% of the chemical sector’s CO 2
emissions. Addressing emissions from ammonia production is therefore a key
component of the decarbonisation of the chemical and agricultural sectors. In
addition to fostering the development of new renewable ammonia plants, the
gradual and increasing co-production of renewable ammonia in existing fossil-
based ammonia plants should be stimulated to begin decarbonising current ammonia
production assets at an early stage. Significant new markets are expected to
develop over the coming decades for ammonia as a hydrogen carrier, as a fuel for
stationary power and heat, and as a transport fuel, particularly in the maritime
industry. For these new markets to materialise, large additional volumes of
ammonia will be required – with demand in 2050 projected to be roughly three
times that of 2020 – and these volumes must be low-carbon.   Additional analyses
