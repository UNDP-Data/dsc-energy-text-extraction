Go This white paper has been developed jointly by members of the Coalition’s
Working Group on Towards 100% Renewable Energy. Building on several case studies
and first-hand interviews with companies, the paper analyses the various
opportunities and challenges in advancing towards sector coupling and an
integrated energy transformation. The findings of the case studies feed into
policy recommendations and key takeaways for both the private sector and
policymakers on how sector coupling can support further advancements towards a
fully renewables-based energy system.   Additional analyses
