About this report This 2023 update to our  Net Zero Roadmap  surveys the complex
and dynamic energy landscape and sets out an updated pathway to net zero by
2050, taking account of the key developments that have occurred since 2021.

behavioural change                        Scaling up energy efficiency,
behavioural change and fuel switching             are key to double the rate of
energy intensity improvements by 2030,             as current measures lead to
only marginal progress.                        Average annual rate of total

• Eco-driving and motorway speed limits of 100 km/h
introduced by 2030                                        • Use of internal
combustion engine cars phased out                     in large cities by 2030
• Space heating temperatures moderated to 19-20 °C                     and space
cooling temperatures to 24-25 °C on average by                     2030
• One-out-of-two long-haul business flights are                     avoided by
2040                                    Efficiency standards cover 90% of energy
use for key appliances                 but other uses lag
Reductions of energy demand from behavioural changes are nearly
five times higher per capita in 2030 in advanced economies
Avoided demand includes behavioural change. The 2030 value shown in the top
graph of the dashboard refers to the average annual rate of energy intensity
improvement between 2022 and 2030 in the NZE Scenario. No new internal
combustion engine trucks are sold after 2040 in advanced economies and after
2045 in the emerging market and developing economies.          Explore
