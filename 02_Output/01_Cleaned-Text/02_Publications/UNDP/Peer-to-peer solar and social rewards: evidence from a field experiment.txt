Download working-paper-383-Carattini et al. (PDF)﻿ The transition to a cleaner
and more resilient economy requires an increased use of renewable energy. The
global market for solar power has expanded dramatically over the last few
decades. Now, as the market becomes mature, new niches need to be identified.
One of these could be the use of ‘peer-to-peer solar’, which offers an
opportunity for households who cannot have solar panels fixed to their own homes
to access solar energy from their neighbours. The authors of this paper
hypothesise that because using a neighbour’s solar power is an  invisible  form
of pro-environmental behaviour, it will mean less reward in the form of social
or peer approval, reducing the attractiveness of peer-to-peer solar. They tested
this by advertising peer-to-peer solar in two Massachusetts cities through
Facebook, in partnership with a company that offered a randomly selected sub-
sample of customers the possibility to share reports of their green behaviour
online. The data confirm the hypothesis. Interest in peer-to-peer solar power
increased by about 30% when ‘green reports’ were mentioned in the
advertisements. However, in the case of more extensive Facebook campaigns, the
algorithm started reaching out to an audience considered ‘less relevant’, and
they were less responsive to the messaging. Therefore, the study also provides a
methodological contribution on how to run field experiments through Facebook ads
in the presence of a heterogeneous audience and an optimising algorithm. Key
points for decision-makers The peer-to-peer solar power model responds to the
fact that not all homeowners can have a solar power system, either because they
are financially constrained or because their home is not suitable. It can also
aid renters who have an interest in accessing solar energy but whose energy
choices are made by their landlord. The authors ran randomised campaigns using
Facebook advertisements in the Massachusetts cities of Cambridge and Somerville
in 2018 and 2020 in collaboration with the local authorities and in partnership
with a start-up company in the United States active in peer-to-peer solar,
MySunBuddy. MySunBuddy agreed to offer to a randomly selected subsample of
customers the possibility of receiving and sharing ‘green reports’ online with
their friends and network, which would document their use of solar energy. The
ads were seen by several tens of thousands of people. The objective was to test
whether interest in peer-to-peer solar increases when prospective customers are
informed that they will be given the option to share their ‘greenness’ with
other people through online social networks, thus making an otherwise invisible
behaviour visible and observable. ‘Observability’ is known to be an important
driver of pro-social behaviour, including in the adoption of new technologies:
people may be more likely to behave in a certain manner if they see others
around them doing so, and, as shown in this study, if others around them see
them doing so. The authors also tested whether people were more likely to show
interest in peer-to-peer solar in the presence of frames emphasising the fact
that both cities were active in transitioning towards a cleaner economy, or in
the presence of frames emphasising the importance of being a frontrunner. They
found that social media users were 30% more likely to show interest in peer-to-
peer solar and respond to the ads when informed that they would be receiving
shareable green reports displaying their greenness. The green reports appeared
to be most effective in combination with the community frame.
