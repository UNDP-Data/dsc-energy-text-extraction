Overview                                                      About this report
Governments, businesses and citizens around the globe are facing the challenge
of climate change and how to accelerate global clean energy transitions to reach
net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. Central to reducing energy-related
emissions are the move away from fossil fuel use to electrified systems;
significant and sustained improvements in energy efficiency; and an increase in
renewable electricity generation capacity.  Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade
and Industry, as part of Japan’s Presidency of the G7, asked the International
Energy Agency (IEA) to examine the evolution of energy efficiency policy in the
context of the clean energy transitions. This acted to support discussions among
G7 countries to provide insights and direction for the G7 energy and climate
agenda. This report reflects the findings of these discussions, and uses them as
a basis for guiding policy makers towards the development of policies to hasten
the delivery of the energy system required for clean energy transitions. The
challenge is considerable but, as this report demonstrates, governments have
already begun the process of transforming their energy efficiency policies to
address it.  The report outlines the ways in which energy efficiency polices can
develop to incorporate flexibility and engagement levers and provides insights
into policy developments in major economies, with examples in three main
sectors: Demand flexibility in appliances and buildings Vehicle fuel economy
standards Industrial energy and carbon reporting. Published December 2023
