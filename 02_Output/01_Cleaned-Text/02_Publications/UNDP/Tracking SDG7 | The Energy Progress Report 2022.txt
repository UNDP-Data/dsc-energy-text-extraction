Report 2022 At today’s rate of progress, the world is still not on track to
achieve the SDG 7 goals by 2030. Advances have been impeded, particularly in the
most vulnerable countries and those that were already lagging. Innovative
policies and technologies continue to emerge and bring benefits to the energy
sector, but the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic set progress back in ways that
were not foreseen in 2019. Not only is the world not on track to reach SDG 7
under current and planned policies, some targets are even farther away than they
were. Recent improvements in increasing energy access in Africa are being
reversed. After declining over the previous six years, the number of people
without access to electricity increased in 2020. At the same time, the perceived
risk of lending money to a number of developing countries has increased
dramatically, making it more expensive for those countries to raise debt finance
for energy technologies and improve energy access. The outlook looks more
positive for renewables and efficiency. Rising prices in 2021 and recovery plans
in key economies focused on renewables and efficiency make the outlook for
renewables and efficiency stronger than it was a year ago. Recent price spikes
and the crisis in Ukraine have also increased uncertainty in global oil and gas
markets, putting renewed pressure on net importers to reduce exposure.
Renewables, efficiency, and electrification are likely to play major roles in
the policy responses to these events. These responses need to be substantial and
reach beyond advanced economies if the world is to achieve the energy-related
SDGs. Getting on track toward meeting SDG 7 depends partly on how governments
continue to support clean energy and energy access investments. As policy makers
chart the path ahead, it is worth bearing in mind that an energy transition
ambitious enough to fulfill SDG 7 can also help meet other social and economic
objectives. With holistic policies in place, the energy transition can foster
sustainable economic growth, create jobs, and improve welfare. Press release :
