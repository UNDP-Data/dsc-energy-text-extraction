Go The scale of the global climate emergency has become ever more obvious in
recent years, with record high temperatures and extreme weather events linked to
climate change occurring around the globe. The success achieved this decade in
reducing greenhouse gas emissions will determine whether global temperature rise
can be limited to 1.5 ° C of pre-industrial levels this century, in line with
the objectives of the Paris Agreement. IRENA’s 1.5 ° C Scenario, set out in the
World Energy Transitions Outlook , presents a pathway to achieve the 1.5 ° C
target by 2050, positioning electrification and efficiency as key transition
drivers, enabled by renewable energy, clean hydrogen and sustainable biomass.
The first volume of the 2023 Outlook provides an overview of progress by
tracking implementation and gaps across all energy sectors, and identifies
priority areas and actions based on available technologies that must be realised
by 2030 to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century. It also provides three key
pillars that can form the foundations for action to realign the global energy
transition with climate objectives: building the necessary infrastructure and
investing at scale to accommodate new production locations, trade patterns and
demand centres; advancing a policy and regulatory architecture that can
facilitate targeted investments, and improve socio-economic and environmental
outcomes; and a strategic realignment of institutional capacities to help ensure
that skills and capabilities match an energy system that integrates a high share
of renewables. To date, policymakers have concentrated on the technological,
institutional, regulatory and policy facets of the energy transition, with
limited attention to its socio-economic implications. Volume 2 of the  World
Energy Transitions Outlook 2023  contends that current transition narratives may
not resonate with all stakeholders, largely due to their omission of central
socio-economic dimensions. Bridging gaps in climate policy ambition and
fostering essential structural changes necessitates unparallel global
collaboration. The second volume is based on IRENA’s macro-econometric modelling
work and provides policymakers with insights into how economic activity,
employment and wellbeing may be affected under the 1.5 ° C pathway, compared to
current policy settings. It adopts a comprehensive approach that includes a set
of supportive policies within the 1.5 ° C pathway designed to facilitate
structural changes and empower countries to fully leverage the socio-economic
opportunities that arise during the energy transition. Volume 2 also employs
IRENA’s welfare index, comprising five dimensions (economic, social,
environmental, distributional and access), to delve deeper into the socio-
economic analysis of the energy transition. Human welfare improves in all
countries and regions under the 1.5 ° C Scenario.   Related content
