Energizing health: accelerating electricity access in health-care facilities
Published by  WHO - World Health Organization IRENA World Bank Group Research
14 Jan 2023 Share this page     Download Full Report Energizing health:
accelerating electricity access in health-care facilities  is a report published
by WHO, IRENA, World Bank, and Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL).   The
report provides a comprehensive update on the status and key actions needed for
providing reliable, modern energy to healthcare facilities in low- and middle-
income countries. It describes available tools and methods for characterizing
the energy requirements for healthcare facilities; identifies technical and
economic considerations for electrification; estimates the amount of investment
that will be needed to provide universal electricity access to health
facilities; and analyses the enabling policy frameworks that create the
conditions for spurring investments and accelerating electrification of
healthcare facilities.   The findings of the report are relevant for agencies
responsible for or involved in the financing and planning of health system-
strengthening programmes – including Ministries of Health, Energy, and Finance,
Rural Energy Agencies, and planning commissions – as well as actors involved in
funding and implementation of energy access solutions for health facilities.
This includes development partners, investors (especially impact investors),
private sector service providers, foundations and non-governmental organizations
operating in the health and in energy sectors.      Web Annexes
