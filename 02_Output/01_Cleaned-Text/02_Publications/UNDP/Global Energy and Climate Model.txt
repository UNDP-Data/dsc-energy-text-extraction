About this report Since 1993, the IEA has provided medium- to long-term energy
projections using a continually evolving set of detailed, world-leading
modelling tools. First, the World Energy Model (WEM) – a large-scale simulation
model designed to replicate how energy markets function – was developed. A
decade later, the Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) model – a technology-rich
bottom-up model – was developed, for use in parallel to the WEM. In 2021, the
IEA adopted for the first time a new hybrid modelling approach relying on the
strengths of both models to develop the world’s first comprehensive study of how
to transition to an energy system at  net zero CO 2  emissions by 2050 . The
integrated framework of the IEA’s Global Energy and Climate Model (GEC Model) is
now the principal tool used to generate detailed sector-by-sector and region-by-
region long-term scenarios across IEA publications, including the  2023 update
of the Net Zero Roadmap , the  World Energy Outlook  series and  Energy
Technology Perspectives   series. Download the GEC Model Methodology document
for an in-depth description of the overall approach and features of the model,
and download the  GEC Model Key Input dataset  for selected key input data.
