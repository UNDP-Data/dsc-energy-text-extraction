Gender equality is not only an intrinsic human right and a core development
objective, but also an instrument for development. It increases productivity and
improves the welfare of families and children while having solid and positive
impacts on GDP per capita. Economic empowerment is a particularly effective
means for women to gain more control over their own lives. However, women are
still frequently ignored, undervalued or unpaid, which prevents them from
becoming dynamic economic participants. Without their full engagement, inclusive
growth is unattainable. Climate change and gender equality are inextricably
linked. Strategies and programmes addressing the effects of climate change must
include the participation, experiences and voices of women – not only because
they are disproportionately impacted by climate change but also because they
have valuable points of view, experience and knowledge to contribute to building
community and national resilience. The solar photovoltaic (PV) industry is the
largest employer within the renewable energy sector, accounting for some 4.3
million jobs. If the solar business does not include a gender lens to
incorporate more women, the industry is at risk of excluding a talent pool that
is integral to its growth. This also undermines opportunities to improve the
working environment for all employees, as having more women in the workplace is
proven to improve organisational culture, resulting in better employee
engagement and retention. This report, the third in IRENA’s gender perspective
series, examines the participation of women in the solar PV sector. The analysis
outlines the share of women in the solar PV workforce, examines the barriers
that women face in the sector - including women living and working in the off-
grid context - and discusses the path to a more diverse solar PV workforce. See
