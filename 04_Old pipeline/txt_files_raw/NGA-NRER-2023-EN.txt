VRE variable renewable energy FOREWORD
The Federal Republic of Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa 
and the largest economy on the continent. The country is expected to 
experience rapid economic growth in the coming decades, leading to a 
significant increase in energy use. Nigeria has therefore reached a vital 
juncture at which it must decide whether to maintain its reliance on fossil 
fuels – accepting the inevitable environmental and economic risks that path 
entails – or capitalise on its ample indigenous renewable energy resources 
to drive economic development, decrease energy costs and significantly 
reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.
This renewable energy roadmap for Nigeria was developed in collaboration 
with the Energy Commission of Nigeria and offers a long-term perspective 
to 2050 guided by IRENA’s World energy transitions outlook.
As Nigeria commits to ever more ambitious climate targets, including 
net-zero commitments, planning must begin now in earnest. Nigeria has 
a unique opportunity to develop a sustainable energy system based on 
renewable energy resources that can support socioeconomic recovery and 
development while addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation 
strategies, and accomplishing energy security, universalisation and 
affordability goals. 
This report provides a comprehensive renewables-focused energy pathway 
for the development of a cleaner and more sustainable national energy 
system. It explores end-use sector electrification, the rapid expansion of 
renewable generation, energy efficiency solutions, the role of emerging 
technologies as well the importance of expanding power sector integration. 
It also presents sector specific technological pathways and investment 
opportunities that will enrich the regional debate and help accelerate the 
energy transformation across Nigeria. 
Accelerating the energy transition will require far-sighted choices, discipline

Energy AgencyFOREWORD
Sustainable energy is the driver of modern development. Availability of 
adequate, reliable, sustainable and cost-effective energy is important for 
the socio-economic development of any nation. Given Nigeria’s progress 
in this regard, it is necessary to continue identifying options for scalingup sustainable energy supply to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) in the country. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) 
has developed this Renewable Energy Roadmap (REMap) for Nigeria 
through the Energy Commission of Nigeria and in collaboration with energy 
professionals and relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies in the 
country. By providing this thorough assessment, it is hoped that individuals, 
firms and governments can be encouraged to embrace renewable energy 
to benefit the national economy and the lives of the Nigerian people. 
Nigeria is endowed with abundant renewable energy resources - namely 
solar, wind, hydro and biomass - that can be harnessed to scale up its 
energy supply and achieve universal energy access, energy security and the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for climate change mitigation. Energy 
consumption in the country is expected to continue to increase due to a rising 
population and improvements in the socio-economic life of the people. 
This report demonstrates how the renewable energy resources of Nigeria 
can be integrated and scaled-up to achieve a sustainable energy mix - 
both on- and off-grid - while meeting growing energy needs to support 
the country’s development. It provides analysis of the energy types and 
quantities currently utilised in all sectors of the economy, namely residential, 
commercial, industry, agriculture and transport. It also predicts how energy 
types and quantities may evolve in two scenarios up to 2050. 
This assessment is timely, given the Government of Nigeria’s commitment 
to reducing its greenhouse gases by 20% unconditionally and 47% 
conditionally by 2030, as well as to reach net-zero emissions by 2060, as 
expressed by at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021. 
This contribution to Nigeria’s efforts to increase the share of renewable 
energy in its energy mix is highly appreciated, and will be useful in reviewing 
the national energy policy and strategic energy plans, as well for academics, 
consultants and investors interested in improving access to clean energy 
sources for various applications in Nigeria.

Federal Republic
of NigeriaKEY FINDINGS AND MESSAGESNigeria is at a key juncture in time; with a growing population and a range of socio‑economic 
challenges, it requires sustainable energy sources to meet the growing needs for all the sectors of 
its economy and achieve universal access to modern energy services. This report demonstrates 
how renewable energy technologies will be key in achieving a sustainable energy mix and 
meeting the growing needs of the country. 
Universal provision of energy services for cooking and power are key objectives of national energy 
policies, in addition to priorities of energy affordability, energy security, and reduced air pollution 
and carbon dioxide (CO2
) emissions. Renewable energy sources can be a driving force in achieving 
all these goals because they are some of the lowest-cost energy sources today and are domestically 
abundant and less polluting than conventional or traditional sources of energy.
This study shows how, under current plans and polices, Nigeria will experience substantial increases 
in primary energy requirements and CO2
 emissions. However, the analysis also shows that various 
economic growth rates over time imply the need for structural changes in the economy as well as for 
induced shifts in the patterns of end-use demands. The study presents how an increased renewable 
uptake scenario, named the Transforming Energy Scenario (TES), sees future capacity expansion of 
Nigeria’s electricity supply system provided largely by renewables, which reduces primary energy 
requirements (because most of the renewables deployed are more efficiently converted to useful 
energy than fossil fuels) and greenhouse gas emissions in tandem with increased electrification 
compared with the Planned Energy Scenario (PES), which represents what would occur under 
current and planned policies. Key results and actions needed to reach the ambition are presented 
in Table 1.
In the TES, the share of primary energy requirements met with renewable energy reaches 47% 
by 2030 and 57% by 2050. In terms of final energy consumption this corresponds to a renewable 
share of 52% by 2030 and 59% by 2050. Electrification plays a significant role in achieving this 
renewable energy share with the share of electricity in final energy use nearly doubling by 2050
to 27% from 2015 levels, in addition to other modern energy forms. 
Key findings
and messagesInvestment in renewables is more cost-effective than the conventional pathway. The TES has 
lower investment costs than the PES, USD 1.22 trillion (2010) compared with USD 1.24 trillion 
(2010), while delivering the same energy service. In terms of average annual investment values, 
this corresponds to USD 35 billion USD (2010) per year compared with USD 36 billion USD (2010) 
per year. This shows that investment in renewables is cost-effective – it is cheaper than the planned 
case, regardless of the economic growth rate achieved. Therefore, by using its abundant and largely 
untapped renewable energy resources, Nigeria could provide sustainable energy for all its citizens in 
a cost-effective manner. However, the study also shows that under very high economic growth (10% 
annual gross domestic product [GDP] growth rate), current energy policies would be insufficient to 
meet the total electricity needs of Nigeria by 2050, with substantial shares of distributed oil-based 
generation needing to remain in the Nigerian electricity supply mix. 
Achieving the TES will require a shifting of and scaling-up of investments in Nigeria in the short 
term to avoid fossil fuel lock-in infrastructure investment with long lifetimes such as natural gas 
pipelines. In the year 2050, in terms of primary energy requirements, the TES uses over 40% less 
natural gas and 65% less oil than the PES, which has a profound implication for infrastructure 
investments for these uses of resources. The risk of stranded assets is substantial, especially given 
the cost, price stability and energy security benefits of renewables in comparison with fossil fuels. 
Fossil fuels are often touted as bridging fuels in the energy transition, but the end destination of 
this bridge is often neglected.
Improvement upon existing efforts to promote clean cooking and access to modern forms 
of energy are needed. Traditional bioenergy plays a large role in the energy sector of Nigeria, 
meeting nearly half of final energy consumption in 2015. Achieving universal energy access by 2030 
has the potential to alter the final energy demand composition of Nigeria. In 2015, the base year, 
the buildings sector accounts for the largest energy consumption. However, its share in total final 
energy demand gradually diminishes as universal modern energy access is also gradually being 
realised to 2030. This is pivotal in reducing the share of traditional bioenergy in final energy 
consumption to 42% by 2030 and just 15% by 2050. Cooking is the most energy-intensive activity 
in the buildings sector today, but as the use of inefficient traditional biomass stops and households 
transition to efficient cookstoves by 2030 and beyond, the share of the residential sector in total 
final energy drops substantially. This sees the residential sector overtaken by the transport and 
industry sectors on account of the magnitude of growth expected in these sectors in the future. 
Should traditional biomass be considered as renewable energy, then modern energy access has the 
capacity to reduce the share of renewables in household fuel mix. However, this must be carefully 
considered in terms of efficiency of the stoves and effects of air pollution. This study shows that 
to promote renewable energy in the Nigerian residential sector, there is a need to diversify the 
cooking mix with electricity and modern renewables that are convenient for cooking in a way that 
is comparable to or even better than liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Expansion of existing appliance efficiency and lighting programmes is needed. In the TES, 
the share of efficient lighting, refrigerators and air conditioners rises in both rural and urban 
households up to 50% by 2030 and to 100% by 2050. This scenario in 2050 sees an increase 
in household income level which need not increase energy demand. This ambitious scenario 
demonstrates how a shift towards the adoption of energy-efficient technologies can reduce the 
overall energy requirement of the sector.
An acceleration of electricity capacity additions, especially distributed solar photovoltaic (PV), 
in the power sector will be key to unlocking Nigeria’s renewable energy resources. Regular 
outages in the centralised power system combined with frequent natural gas and water shortages 
for generators mean that system peak power capacity is substantially below the rated capacity of 
the system. This has led to a high reliance on costly distributed oil-based power generation with 
profound implications for air quality, economic cost of unreliable electricity and expensive backup. 
The TES shows how this need not be the case and how the benefits of Nigeria’s wealth of solar 
resources can be unlocked. 
Total installed power generation capacity needs in the TES reach 62 gigawatts (GW) in 2030 and 
178 GW in 2050, of which 77% is renewable in 2030 and 92% is renewable in 2050. Solar PV 
capacity is a “no-regrets” investment in this scenario, reaching 32 GW in 2030 and 115 GW by 
2050 in the central TES. In terms of electricity generation shares, this corresponds to 70% by 2030
and 84% by 2050. Fostering innovative financing mechanisms for distributed renewables and 
utility-scale technologies such as blended finance and microfinance will help deliver this, especially 
in the substitution of diesel generators by solar home kits and mini-grids, which have a higher 
upfront cost but significantly lower operation cost. This will combine favourably with increased 
electrification of various end uses, further driving down the energy intensity of demand sectors 
with some of the lowest-cost power available on the market today. 
Hydropower will also be key in balancing the centralised power system by offering flexibility to 
mitigate solar power variability. The TES sees hydropower reaching 13 GW in 2030 and 15.5 GW
in 2050. Despite having relatively larger installed capacities in the TES, electricity generation under 
current and planned policies remains larger because renewables, such as solar PV, are constrained 
by the resources underpinning them. The TES shows that there is further scope to improve energy 
efficiency beyond the levels envisaged under current and planned policies. This energy efficiency 
will be key in pivoting the Nigerian economy towards high-innovation sectors using domestic 
energy renewables and energy-efficient technological options, especially solar PV power driven 
electrification of end use.
Faster adoption of biofuels and electric vehicles (EVs) when combined with an increased role for 
public transportation, will help to sustainably meet growing transportation demand. Nigeria has 
a biofuel policy but lacks a dedicated EV policy and will need substantial expansion of the power 
sector and its reliability to facilitate a reliable shift to EVs. The share of electric private cars could 
reach 10% by 2030 and 35% by 2050 in the TES, while biofuel-based private cars could account 
for 20% in 2030 and 25% in 2050. A major challenge to the implementation of alternative fuels in Nigerias transport sector is the lack of availability of the fuels, which thereby reduces the choices 
available to Nigerian consumers. The penetration of EVs here in this study rely on a reliable power 
sector with significant reinforcement of the transmission system in tandem with off-grid renewables 
expansion. The TES also sees significant modal shifts: 20% of private car demand shifts to public 
transport; 40% of interstate passenger road movement and 40% of freight shift to rail. This 
scenario also sees these being enhanced by significant amounts of renewable energy, with 40% of 
trains and 35% of buses being electric by 2050. Expansion of the railways could facilitate much of 
this modal shift; however, this would necessitate large infrastructure and upfront investment costs. 
This modal shift would best be accompanied by a corresponding increase in renewables-driven 
transportation sources.
Nigeria would benefit from the promotion of the adoption of solar process heat in large industries 
where it could deliver a reliable supply of thermal energy and reduce local air pollution. Industrial 
clusters should be promoted in policy so that multiple small and medium enterprises can derive 
process heat from a few solar thermal installations. In the TES, these technologies could serve up 
to 8% of industrial energy demand by 2030 and 29% by 2050. This would also play a significant 
part in reducing the role of traditional bioenergy in the sector. Also, electric process heat provided 
via renewables should be encouraged for industries that lack the capacity to adopt solar thermal 
systems.
Efficient irrigation pumps and tractors in the agriculture sector should be promoted to improve 
energy security by reducing the impact of internal fuel price volatility on the sector. Awareness 
of solar irrigation pumps and their associated benefits needs to be promoted, especially in rural 
areas. Polices also need to be developed and promoted for the technologies that underpin the TES 
to deliver higher efficiency and renewable energy use in this sector to encourage their adoption 
by farmers. Key will be the promotion of solar-based irrigation pumps, which reach penetrations in 
irrigation of 15% by 2030 and 50% by 2050 in this scenario, in addition to the share of biofuel and 
electric tractors, which combined reach 25% by 2030 and 60% by 2050. 
Irrespective of the level of GDP growth, CO2
 emissions are on an upward trend. Energy sector 
CO2
 emissions were about 119 million tonnes (Mt) per year in 2015 and in the PES rise rapidly to 
516 Mt per year by 2050. In the TES these grow much more slowly to 189 Mt per year by 2050. 
Additionally, it is shown in 2030 that the dominant source of CO2
 emissions in the country shifts from 
the power sector to the transport sector, clearly identifying the sector which should be prioritised 
for emissions mitigation measures in the future. 
Overall, policies for accelerated deployment of renewables are needed, but careful selection of 
technologies is needed to unlock the benefits achieved in this study. Also, the highly distributed 
institutional structure of the energy sector in Nigeria means that co‑ordination of policies will be 
essential to unlocking integrated energy transition planning and ensuring its success. A crosscutting agency or body tasked with doing so would be helpful in building consensus and developing 
a coherent plan which in turn would allow for the scaling-up of renewable energy to meet the needs 
across the Nigerian energy sector.Table 1 Key results of the analysis for Planned and Transforming Energy Scenarios and key actions needed

African continent. It is home to one of the fastest-growing populations globally, which has 
led to a rapidly increasing demand for energy services that will be key to unlocking economic 
development. This presents a substantial opportunity to develop the rich natural renewable 
energy resources of the country and unlock low-carbon growth. 
Nigeria is a lower-middle-income developing country which has shown its commitment to the global 
transition to a sustainable energy future and increasing its share of renewables in the energy mix. 
Nigeria signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, a landmark agreement to reduce global greenhouse 
gas emissions to limit global temperature increase to below 2°C and has made commitments to 
develop its energy system in line with these goals. In its recent revision of its Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) as part of the Paris Agreement, Nigeria has pledged an unconditional 20% reduction 
on emissions in a business-as-usual scenario by 2030, and an upward revision of its conditional 
reduction pledge from 45% to 47% dependent on sufficient financial assistance, technology transfer 
and capacity building. In addition, at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), Nigerian President 
Muhammadu Buhari pledged that Nigeria will cut emissions to net zero by 2060.
The post-COVID-19 recovery will need to balance meeting these goals with the substantial 
development challenges facing the country in order to achieve sustainable growth and development. 
Improving access to modern forms of energy and the high levels of unemployment remain key 
barriers to economic development and are the primary focus areas for the government in its pursuit 
of a prosperous future for the nation. Thus, the strategies set out in the Nigerian NDC were written 
with a view to addressing all these challenges while simultaneously mitigating emissions growth. 
These strategies spanned the whole energy system of the country and included 13 gigawatts of 
decentralised solar photovoltaic in addition to improvements in the energy efficiency in the power, 
residential, commercial, industry and transport sectors.
IntroducctionAchieving these goals would lead to considerable changes in the national energy system and would 
shape the investment decisions over the coming years. Nigeria has large renewable potential and 
has already made some promising strides towards increasing domestic deployment of renewable 
energy. Nigeria has the potential to play an important role in the global energy transformation. The 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the Nigerian Energy Commission collaborated 
on this Renewable Energy Roadmap project, also referred to as REmap Nigeria, to explore how best 
to unlock the country’s renewable energy potential while also ensuring tremendous sustainable 
growth.
This study analyses the additional renewable energy deployment potentials out to the year 2050 in 
close consultation with key stakeholders, with an additional 2030 focus to aid shorter-term policy 
development, across the Nigerian energy system and as a result provide additional context for 
energy policy discussions of how increased ambition in terms of renewable energy, beyond the 
current government policy and targets, can be realised. This analysis expressly does not aim to 
replace national energy sector planning, but rather seeks to further inform it with an expansive 
analysis of realistic renewables deployment potential and provide input to further national energy 
sector ambition.
1.1 The REmap process
IRENA developed the Renewable Energy Roadmap (REmap) programme (IRENA, 2014) in response 
to requests from members for assessment and determination of strategies and pathways to increase 
the share of renewable energy in energy systems.
REmap focuses on identifying the long-term realistic potentials of renewable energy to the 
year 2030 and 2050 in all parts of the energy system. This process quantifies related costs and 
investment requirements and assesses its contribution and climate objectives. It is a simple and 
transparent analysis of technology options that quantifies the potential of renewable energy by 
end-use sector for the countries and regions to which it is applied. This approach is often linked 
with a variety of dedicated sectoral models to help analyse the pathways developed in terms of 
different end-use and transformation sectors. The choice of an options approach is deliberate, 
as REmap is an exploratory study of additional renewable energy potential. Its core strength lies
in its consultative and collaborative nature where the renewable energy roadmap is developed in 
collaboration with and evaluated by energy sector stakeholders in the country or region in question. 
IRENA has conducted country-level REmap analyses and has prepared country reports for the 
People’s Republic of China, Ethiopia, Germany, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Ukraine, the United 
Arab Emirates and the United States, among others. 
The country analyses follow the approach of:1

 All the REmap related material and methodology are available for download at www.irena.org/remap. There is also a detailed 
overview of REmap methodology, sources and papers available on the website.• Building the Planned Energy Scenario (PES); this represents the baseline for energy demand 
and fuel mix out to 2030 based on current policies and strategies at country level, including 
targets for renewables.
• Determining technology options based on renewable potential (based on theoretical overall 
resource potentials and both technical and economic factors that constrain deployment) 
realisable to 2030. These are called REmap Options and serve to substitute for conventional 
technologies that are considered in the PES. 
• Assessing REmap Options for electricity and heat production, energy end use in industry and 
buildings (i.e. residential, commercial, public), and for the transport sector. The sum of the options 
results in a new energy mix, which is called the Transforming Energy Scenario (TES).
Throughout this analysis, the renewables share is determined in relation to total final energy 
consumption (TFEC).2
 End-use sectors comprise the following:
• Buildings: include the residential, commercial and public sectors. Renewable energy is used in 
direct applications for heating, cooling or cooking purposes, or as renewable electricity.
• Industry: refers to downstream industrial activities only such as the manufacturing sector, where 
renewable energy is consumed in direct use applications that comprise mainly process heat, and 
as electricity from renewable sources.
• Transportation: which can make direct use of renewables through the consumption of liquid and 
gaseous biofuels, or through use of electricity generated from renewable energy technologies.
• Other sectors: including agriculture (including fisheries and forestry), mining and construction.
The REmap analysis in the case of this study was strongly guided by local stakeholders including 
both the IRENA focal points at the Energy Commission of Nigeria, from which there was strong 
collaboration throughout, and the outcome of stakeholders’ consultations held in Abuja in January 
2020. The analysis at every stage has been presented and discussed to make sure the resulting 
analysis fits the national context and realities facing the country. Not only does it help with the 
suitability of the study but its participatory nature offers genuine local input to the work and 
meaningfully shapes its results. This is core to the application of the REmap process and was 
influential throughout the modelling process. Additionally, the REmap approach often involves 
analysing the impact of differing growth rates on the PES, REmap Options and the subsequently 
derived TES.
2
 TFEC is the energy delivered to consumers, whether as electricity, heat or fuels that can be used directly as a source of energy. 
This consumption is usually subdivided into that used in: transport; industry; residential, commercial and public buildings; and 
agriculture; it excludes non energy uses of fuels.1.2 Scenario definitions for Nigeria
Planned Energy Scenario (PES)
The PES is essentially the primary reference case for this study, providing a perspective on energy 
system developments based on current national energy plans and other planned targets and 
policies, including Nigeria’s NDC under the Paris Agreement. The PES is based on existing policy 
and plans, with no other substantial measures. Energy and environmental policies influence future 
energy demand and supply trends. The Nigerian government has a long history of developing 
sound policies but has faced challenges in establishing implementation mechanisms. Over the years, 
several policies and programmes have been developed for the energy sector. Here, it was assumed 
that the various programmes outlined in the Nigerian energy/climate policies will be realised. 
Transforming Energy Scenario (TES)
The TES describes an ambitious, yet realistic, energy transformation pathway based largely on 
renewable energy sources and steadily improved energy efficiency (though not limited exclusively 
to these technologies). This could set the energy system on the path needed to keep the rise in 
global temperatures to well below 2°C and towards 1.5°C during this century. The TES proposed 
by this study is aimed at expanding the current scope of renewable energy development in the 
country well beyond the stated capacities outlined in the national energy policy frameworks. 
While an understanding of current national plans and recent national developments was derived 
in the PES, an understanding was also gained as to how renewables can play a more significant 
role than envisaged in these plans, which still feature significant levels of fossil fuel reliance. This 
scenario serves to maximise the use of renewable energy technologies across the energy system 
in a transformative and cost-effective manner with many benefits that extend well beyond the 
energy sector. Furthermore, in the TES, assumptions are made on the end-use technologies in 
terms of new technologies penetration as well as improvements in the efficiency of the existing 
stock. The PES and TES are very different scenarios; the TES seeks to provide a realistic assessment 
of how renewable energy can be increased beyond current plans with many secondary benefits. 
The TES does not intend to replace the PES; rather, it seeks to provide an alternative development 
pathway strongly based on renewable energy technologies and can serve as context to further 
inform existing or planned energy policies.MODELLING 
METHODOLOGY AND 02 KEY ASSUMPTIONS2.1 Modelling methodology and socio‑economic assumptions
Each Renewable Energy Roadmap (REmap) study is a bespoke process using the data and tools 
best suited to the needs of the study. This is also the case for the REmap Nigeria analysis, where 
data sources, methods and models were chosen to make the best use of the data available to 
present a renewable energy pathway that explores the potential for further renewable energy 
deployment. This section serves to outline the methodology and key assumptions for the study, 
which are elaborated in more detail in Appendix B.
The overall approach employed in this study was to use an integrated energy system model to 
analyse how Nigeria’s growing energy service demands can be supplied under various scenarios 
out to 2050. This study largely relies upon energy system analysis using TIMES (The Integrated 
MARKAL-EFOM System) modelling framework for Nigeria (Loulou, Remme, et al., 2005; Loulou, 
Remne, et al., 2005). The main output of TIMES are the energy system configurations to meet 
energy service demands, which are exogenous to the model and further detailed in Appendix B. 
The model determines values for primary energy supply, final energy consumption, energy flows, 
greenhouse gas emissions, capacities of technologies and marginal emissions abatement costs 
based on an assumed set of cost parameters and demand projections. 
On the demand side of TIMES-Nigeria model, econometric models were developed based on various 
macroeconomic drivers that are used to understand the changing patterns of end-use demands. 
The macroeconomic form of any country serves as the basis of its development trajectory and also 
plays a key role in determining its future energy demand trajectory and corresponding emissions. 
Population and gross domestic product (GDP) are the key forces influencing the patterns of growth, 
production and consumption choices in an economy. The GDP trajectories used in this study were 
requested at the REmap workshop held in Abuja in January 2020 with key stakeholders spanning 
the Nigerian energy sector and the Honourable Minister of Science and Technology to help enable 
a deeper understanding of scenarios developed. The implications of these results were further 
discussed and validated at the final review workshop held in Abuja in late 2022. The central scenario 
used for this study is 7% per year annual growth rate (a rate which was decided upon in consultation 
with stakeholders) with two additional growth rate scenarios also considered with a 5% per year 
Modelling 
methodology and
key assumptionsaverage growth pessimistic case and 10% per year average growth optimistic case. Demand driver 
analysis is imperative to examine the associated costs and benefits of undertaking alternative choices 
and understanding the macroeconomic implications on the economy. Accordingly, this study examines 
how these drivers may influence final energy consumption in the Nigerian economy.
2.2 Nigeria’s renewable energy resources
Nigeria has vast natural renewable energy resources which will be essential for sustainable 
development of the country; however, at present these resources are very much underexploited. 
In the case of this study the potentials were based on (2014a, 2014b), Sobamowo and Ojolo (2018), 
(2019), IHA (2021) and the U.S. Department of Trade (2021) are displayed in Table 2. The historic 
generation capacity and bioenergy use in 2015 as shown in 2015 in Table  2 are based on ECN 
(2015a), IRENA (2021a) and the U.S Department of Trade (2021) in addition to feedback received by 
stakeholders at the REmap workshop held in Abuja, Nigeria, in January 2020.
Solar
Nigeria has high solar resource potential characterised by an average annual global horizontal 
irradiation ranging between 1 600 kilowatt hours per square metre (kWh/m2

(ESMAP). For additional information: https://globalsolaratlas.info.with the highest values (greater than 2 000  kWh/m) located in the northern part of the 
country. IRENA estimates the technical potential for solar photovoltaic (PV) in the country at 
210 gigawatts (GW) considering only 1% of the suitable land can be utilised for project development
(IRENA and AfDB, 2022). The potential for concentrated solar power (CSP) is also very significant 
with a potential of approximately 88.7 GW and is mostly located in northern Nigeria, where the 
direct normal irradiance is highest (Ogunmodimu, 2013). 
Wind
The country has moderate wind potential with average wind speeds at 10 metres (m) height ranging 
between 2.1 m/second (s) and 8 m/s with the highest values (greater than 7 m/s) located in the 
northern part of the country. IRENA estimates the technical potential for wind at 3.2 GW considering 
only 1% of the suitable land can be utilised for project development (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Apart 
from the coastal and offshore locations, the wind speed in southern Nigeria is relatively low, while 
higher wind speeds are experienced in the northern region (Emodi and Yusuf, 2015; Idris, Ibrahim 
and Albani, 2020). Currently, there is no estimate of offshore wind potential in Nigeria. However, 
the Federal Ministry of Power says that it is conducting an offshore wind mapping. For this study, it 
is assumed that only onshore wind turbines will be deployed in Nigeria. The target of the National 
Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) is to achieve 0.17 GW of grid-connected wind capacity
by 2020 and 0.8 GW by 2030.

Nigeria has a large hydro potential of around 24 GW and a small hydro potential of about 3.5 GW. 
This potential for the most part is yet to be exploited. In 2015, Nigeria had about 1.9 GW installed 
capacity of large hydro and about 60  megawatts of small hydro (ECN, 2014b; IHA, 2021; U.S. 
Department of Trade, 2021).
Biomass
Exploiting the huge potential of biomass resources in the country, especially in the form of agricultural 
residues for power generation, will go a long way to resolving the current energy crisis in Nigeria 
(Simonyan and Fasina, 2013). While there exist many biomass options for power generation, this 
study considers only agricultural residues as feedstock for biomass power plants (ECN, 2015a)

system as the baseline for the Renewable Energy Roadmap (REmap) analysis. It presents the 
current role and uses of renewables in the national energy mix, as well as the drivers for increased 
renewables deployment and socio-economic and environmental implications from current energy 
production and use. Table 3 below provides an overview of the key macroeconomic and energy 
system indicators. The numbers help to describe the population and economy that the Nigerian 
energy system serves and to explain some of the energy policy choices of the country and are 
based on a wide range of sources (NBS, 2020; SE4ALL, 2021; World Bank, 2021).
The Federal Republic of Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with a population of nearly 
200 million people and has the largest economy in Africa in terms of GDP (Olawale, 2020). The 
total final energy consumption (TFEC) in Nigeria amounted to around 2.1 exajoules (EJ) in 2015, 
which is approximately 9% of the TFEC in Africa. Currently, Nigeria’s energy sector is heavily 
dominated by fossil fuels and traditional biomass (Ley, Gaines and Ghatikar, 2015). Nigeria is the 
13th-largest producer and the 8th-largest exporter of crude oil in the world (Africanvault, 2015; 
Investopedia, 2019).

Energy context
and potentialTable 3 provides a snapshot of the nation as a whole and offers perspective on areas to focus on for 
the development of this study. In terms of access to electricity and clean cooking, the rural-urban
divide is very apparent with rural areas having substantially lower attainment of access to both. 
These observations merit consideration while evaluating the renewable energy options for Nigeria. 
The relatively low urbanisation rate combined with low GDP per capita and large population signify 
large potential for economic expansion in the future, which evidences the opportunity to ensure 
that it be a sustainable pathway. 
Nigeria is a major actor in Africa, and will play a key role in determining the continent’s future, as 
its population is estimated to double to over 400 million by 2050, according to Statista (Statista, 
2022). This shows clearly how Nigeria’s vast resource potentials for solar energy, hydropower and 
bioenergy (Brimmo et al., 2017) will be key to unlocking economic growth, expansion of provision 
of modern energy services and sustainable development not only in Nigeria but Africa as a whole. 
The rest of this section explores the energy context of Nigeria in terms of how energy is currently 
used in each sector of the energy system in addition to recent key national energy policies that 
are shaping the near-term expansion of the energy sector and serves as context and basis for the 
energy pathways presented as part of this study. The base year for this analysis was 2015; it was 
selected because at the time of writing it was the year for which the available dataset was richest. 
All results presented for this base year are based on a bottom-up, technology-rich assessment of 
energy use.

Figure 3 Nigerian primary energy supply in 2015 base year (2 730 PJ) based on model results and 
validated through a range of stakeholder engagement3.1 Primary energy
The primary energy supply of Nigeria is highly renewable at a share of approximately 47%. Biomass 
dominates the energy mix in Nigeria with a share of 43%, as presented in Figure 3. This is due to 
its extensive use for heating and cooking purposes where substantial progress remains to be made 
in terms of access to clean cooking fuels, as shown in the later sections. The biomass subsector in 
Nigeria is highly informal with a lot of uncertainties regarding its usage, especially in rural areas, 
and issues relating to fuel stacking in the Nigerian buildings sector. It is also unclear to what degree 
biomass is used in the Nigerian industry sector. Thus, the share of biomass in Nigeria’s primary 
energy supply may be greater than the value from the model due to differences in methodological 
approaches, energy access levels and efficiency values of the modelled biomass technologies. 
As per the Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics living standards survey, there was only about 
18% access to clean cooking (gas and electric stoves) in Nigeria in 2019 (NBS, 2020). However, 
international statistics suggest that access to clean cooking in Nigeria was around 13% in the same 
year (IEA, IRENA, UNSD, World Bank, WHO, 2022, p. 7). The data discrepancies may be attributed 
to the differences in survey and measurement techniques and what constitutes clean cooking. Most 
cooking uses traditional biomass, which indicates that air quality can be substantially improved by 
moving to other technologies and many deaths associated with air pollution avoided. 
Oil makes up a similar share of primary energy requirement as bioenergy. While Nigeria is trying 
to get its refineries working at optimum capacity, the existing capacity is insufficient to satisfy the 
local demand for petroleum products. To meet this requirement, 80% of the refined oil products 
used in Nigeria are imported from abroad (PWC, 2017). Despite the ongoing construction of a large 
oil refinery capable of refining up to 650 000 barrels per day (George, Payne and Zhdannikov, 
2021), Nigeria has much to gain from pivoting towards domestic renewable energy sources in place 
of domestic fossil fuels. As shown in Pai et al. (2021), global fossil fuel employment may drop by 
80% in a 2°C scenario compliant with the Paris Agreement, while renewable-based employment 
could increase fivefold. Nurturing local development of abundant renewable energy resources 
would potentially spur local innovative renewable energy champions in such a scenario, which 
would enable the creation of local jobs and spin-off industries.
Natural gas, other renewables and hydropower make up the remainder of primary energy 
requirement of Nigeria and are used in the power sector for the most part. The low penetration 
of variable renewables such as wind and solar shows the opportunity that lies in integrating them 
in the power sector given the substantial cost reductions of the technologies in recent years and 
the enormous natural resource that Nigeria has, especially for solar power (IRENA, 2021b). Among 
the many advantages of these technologies, their modularity makes it easier to operationalise 
in a decentralised setting and in combination with storage can reliably provide power to a
significant extent.
Unlike many other countries, Nigeria has relatively low coal use. At present, there is no coal power 
generation of note in the country. The current local consumption is mainly from the cement, brick, 
foundry and bakery industries. All this shows that while the primary energy supply of Nigeria has a very substantial non-fossil share, 
its composition has negative externalities that, if changed going forward, could allow for improved 
air quality, domestic job creation and economic expansion. The proceeding subsections further 
unpack the composition of this energy use at present in Nigeria and contextualise the scenarios 
developed as part of the REmap analysis out to 2030 and 2050. 
3.2 Total final energy consumption
Nigerian TFEC is dominated by the residential sector, making up nearly 50% of final energy 
consumption; the industrial and transport sectors each make up a fifth, with the remainder supplying 
the needs of the commercial and agricultural sectors. Energy demand in the agricultural sector is 
negligible due to the low mechanisation of the sector. This will change as the Nigerian population 
and economy expand to meet the needs of the country. 
The outcome of this study provides additional context on how best to inform policy decisions by 
analysing various possible future pathways with a view to advancing the role of renewable energy. 
This study aims to develop a renewable energy pathway for the Nigerian energy system, but central 
to this is facilitating sustainable development. As shown in Figure 5, the renewable energy share in 
most sectors, especially the residential sector is quite high; this is because of the very substantial 
use of firewood and other sources of traditional biomass. Thus, considering energy use purely based 
on renewable energy share belies the advancement needed to improve modern energy access and 
improved air quality which is a key focus of the Transforming Energy Scenario (TES).

validated through a range of stakeholder engagementThat said, Nigeria has made some promising strides towards sustainable development with an array 
of policies designed to advance this goal. These policies are accounted for in all scenarios developed 
as part of this study and are further described in the following sections.
3.3 Buildings sector (residential and commercial)
Nigerian households and commercial enterprises (restaurants, malls, banks, hotels, etc.) use energy 
for different purposes: cooking, water heating, lighting, air conditioning, refrigeration and for 
powering other miscellaneous electrical appliances such as fans, computers, washing machines, 
phones, televisions (TVs) etc. Owing to the increases in GDP, per capita income and urbanisation, 
improved lifestyle, and the general increase in population, there has been a substantial increase in 
Nigeria’s residential sector energy demand. The final energy demand of the residential sector has 
varied over the years and has increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.64%, from 
50.92 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 1990 to around 105.59 Mtoe in 2018 (IEA, 2021). The 
final energy demand of the commercial sector has increased at a CAGR of 2.04%, from 1.94 Mtoe 
in 1990 to around 3.41 Mtoe in 2018 (IEA, 2021). The energy basket of the sectors mainly consists 
of electricity, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and biomass (fuelwood, animal dung and 
charcoal) (ECN, 2013).
Due to the observed spatial heterogeneity in residential energy use, the energy demand of the 
Nigerian residential sector may be grouped as demand from rural and urban households (Dioha 
and Kumar, 2020). With respect to electricity access, in 2019 only 46% of the rural population had 
access while in the urban areas the value was around 90% (NBS, 2020). However, there is disparity

Figure 5 Renewable energy share in total final consumption by enduse sector, most of which is from

indicating a level of 25% in rural areas and 84% in urban areas in 2020 (IEA, IRENA, UNSD, World 
Bank, WHO, 2022). With respect to clean cooking, there is also disparity of data. The Nigeria Living 
Standards Survey of the National Bureau of Statistics suggests that around 18% of Nigerians have 
access to clean cooking (NBS, 2020) while the SDG7 tracker indicates that only about 15% of 
Nigerian households had access to clean cooking in 2020 (IEA, IRENA, UNSD, World Bank, WHO, 
2022). Depending on the data source, all indicators show that the challenge is more pronounced 
in rural areas, where only about 6% of the rural population have access to clean cooking (NBS, 
2020). The main challenges to modern energy access in Nigeria include lack of access to adequate 
financing, lack of adequate business models, inadequate planning and poor governance, as well as 
weak human/institutional capabilities. 
The fuels/technologies used for cooking in the Nigerian residential/commercial sector are diverse. 
Traditional three-stone fire, improved woodstove, LPG, kerosene and electric stoves are used for 
cooking in the sector. Fuelwood is the predominant fuel for cooking, especially in the rural areas 
of Nigeria. It is usually collected from the nearby forests in the villages in rural areas. However, 
in the urban areas, fuelwood is usually purchased from local vendors who sell it at a marginal 
price compared with other cooking fuels such as LPG. The high reliance on traditional biomass 
for cooking has led to the depletion of many forests in the country and has also resulted in the 
destruction of several natural ecosystems (Gujba, Mulugetta and Azapagic, 2015). Furthermore, 
air pollutant emissions such as carbon monoxide and particulate matter – from the incomplete 
combustion of biomass in inefficient cookstoves – have severe health implications and contribute to 
around 64 000 deaths per year in Nigeria (HEI and IHME, 2018).

Figure 6 Total final energy consumption in residential buildings in 2015 based on model results and 
validated through a range of stakeholder engagementAs most buildings in Nigeria (especially in the rural areas) are not equipped with water heating 
facilities, they use cooking devices to making hot water for bathing. Moreover, many households 
fitted with water heaters mainly use the standard inefficient types. With respect to lighting, Nigerian 
households depend on electricity, kerosene, dry cell batteries (such as alkaline cells or rechargeable 
lithium-ion cells), candles, grass, etc., but at the national level, electricity, dry cell batteries and 
kerosene constitute the main sources of lighting for the vast majority of households. The electric 
lighting technologies include incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and lightemitting diodes (LEDs). Electrical appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners are mainly 
localised in urban households. Most of the appliances found in Nigerian buildings are very old and 
inefficient. Some of them are scraps that are imported from Western countries after they have served 
their useful life. This scenario indicates that there is a large scope for improved energy efficiency in 
the sector. With the growing urbanisation and increased demand for a luxurious lifestyle, the use of 
refrigerators and air conditioners is expected to rise in the future (Dioha and Kumar, 2020). 
Various programmes have been initiated to reform the residential and commercial sectors in Nigeria 
as a solution to the challenges. Recently, there have been a lot of efforts and political discussions 
to provide all households in Nigeria with modern energy access by 2030. The National Renewable 
Action Plan (NREAP) and the Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) Action Agenda5
 seek to increase 
electricity access to around 75% (90% in urban areas and 60% in rural) by 2020 and to 90% by 2030.

 The Action Agenda is a strategy-driven and holistic document acting as an umbrella for energy sector development at the 
national level. It defines the national SEforALL objectives and determines how the three goals of SEforALL can be achieved.

Figure 7 Total final energy consumption in commercial buildings in 2015 based on model results and

cooking with improved cookstoves by 2020 and 80% by 2030, working together with the private 
sector to deploy LPG at reasonable cost for Nigerians by 2020 and subsequently up to 2030. The 
NREAP also seeks to expand efficient lighting to almost 100% of households by 2030. Furthermore, 
the current COVID-19 pandemic has put severe limitations on investment in modern energy access 
(including clean cooking systems) in the country, which, in turn, is pushing the country further away 
from achieving universal access to clean cooking by 2030. Notwithstanding, Nigeria continues to 
see progress in the diffusion of clean cooking equipment in the country. The Nigerian Alliance 
for Clean Cookstoves is working to bring in new partners to further strengthen and support the 
distribution of clean cookstoves (NACC, 2021). The alliance is also supporting many enterprises 
in Nigeria to access development funds such as Spark and Women’s Empowerment Funds and 
the Catalytic Small Grant to promote the adoption of clean cookstoves (One Earth, 2021). A 
national testing centre for cookstoves and fuels has also been developed (Clean Cooking Alliance, 
2021). A programme to reduce dependency on firewood has been launched in Katsina state in 
partnership with the European Union; Oxfam; the International Centre for Energy, Environment and 
Development; and the Nigerian Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (Oxfam, 2021). The joint programme 
provides support to women-owned enterprises and conducts business development training for 
local entrepreneurs on the production and marketing of a more consumer-friendly, fuel-efficient 
stove (Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, 2016).
In recent years, the government has made giant strides in phasing out incandescent bulbs through 
its various agencies and programmes. The Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN) and the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have also worked on joint projects to promote energy 
efficiency in Nigeria’s residential and commercial sectors. The project strategically aims at reducing 
the energy consumption of key end-use technologies such as light bulbs, air conditioners and 
refrigerators. Other energy efficiency initiatives in the sector include the enforcement of FDNIS 
ECOSTAND 071-2:2017EE: Minimum Energy Performance Standards Part 2: Air conditioning products. 
This standard covers requirements for domestic and commercial air-conditioning products. Other 
government ministries (e.g. Federal Ministry of Environment) and non-governmental organisations 
are also working towards improving the energy situation of the sectors.
3.4 Transport sector
Against the backdrop of rapid population and GDP growth, the energy demand of the Nigerian 
transport sector has grown substantially over the years at a CAGR of 6.42%, from 3.97 Mtoe in 
1990 to around 22.69 Mtoe in 2018 (IEA, 2021). The rapid growth in the energy consumption of the 
sector is expected to continue because of the projected increase in population. The fuel mix of the 
Nigerian transport sector is dominated by gasoline and diesel (Gujba, Mulugetta and Azapagic, 
2013). In terms of vehicles per population, Nigeria’s car ownership is just around 64 vehicles per 
1 000 Nigerians. This value is relatively low compared with 569 vehicles cars per 1 000 in Europe 
(European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, 2021). However, the desire for car ownership 
in the country is extremely high due to the social status it conveys as well as the limited public 
transportation system.The modes of transport in Nigeria include road, air, rail and water. Road is the major mode of 
motorised transport in Nigeria with private cars contributing over 40% of the final consumption 
as shown in Figure 8 above. It accounts for over 90% of both passenger and freight movements in 
terms of kilometre(s) travelled. The major means of road transportation include motorcycles, private 
cars, taxis, light buses, coaches and heavy-duty vehicles based on the World Bank’s vehicle survey in 
Nigeria (Cervigni, 2013). Motorcycles are mainly used for commercial purpose but are also privately 
owned. They are mainly the two-stroke-engine type and powered by gasoline. The private cars 
consist of the sport utility vehicle (SUV), sedan, wagon, pickups and jeeps which are solely used for 
private purposes. Around 98% of private vehicles run on gasoline. The taxis, light buses and coaches 
provide the majority of public transport. The heavy goods vehicles (trucks) are mainly powered by 
diesel. The adoption of flex-fuel, biofuels and electric vehicles is still at the infant stage of development 
in the country. The air transport subsector in Nigeria accounts for the second-highest share of 
modal contribution to transport output (Daramola and Fagbemi, 2019). However, the air transport 
subsector has accounted for just 6-7% of transport GDP in the last couple of years. Nevertheless, the 
air transport subsector has much more potential for contributing to the local economy, particularly 
through increased capacity for earning and conservation of foreign exchange (Daramola and 
Fagbemi, 2019). The Nigerian rail system is underdeveloped with only few locomotives on track and 
will require major overhaul to become a significant mode of transportation in the country. Nigerian 
trains are for the most part served by diesel, though currently progress is being made to revamp 
the Nigerian railway system (Onokala and Olajide, 2020; GCC, 2021). In addition, water travel is also 
underdeveloped in the country (Obeta, 2014; Onokala and Olajide, 2020).

Note: CNG = compx-ressed natural gas.The growing population will need more public and private transport. Worsening congestion and 
ever-increasing demand for movement in the large cities such as Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja 
implies that ever-greater numbers of vehicles are required to serve the public. For freight vehicle 
activity, the anticipated economic growth will drive a greater demand for the movement of freight 
and goods. Moreover, the existing vehicle fleet is made up of ageing and high-polluting vehicles, 
the majority imported from Western countries only when they approach the end of their economic 
life (Ayetor et al., 2021). Poor routine maintenance and the harsh environment in Nigeria mean that 
the condition of these vehicles deteriorates quickly. Nigeria is also not exempt from the negative 
impacts of fossil fuel-driven transport. Many Nigerians, in particular those living in traffic-congested 
towns and cities, such as Lagos and Port Harcourt, are exposed to air pollution, which contributes to 
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and this exacerbates poverty in the country. 
In recent years, the federal government of Nigeria has shown its commitment to implement 
policies and strategies to advance a safe, secure, affordable and sustainable transport system in 
the country. The Nigerian Biofuel Policy and Incentives came into effect on 24 July 2007 (IEA and 
IRENA, 2021). The aim is to gradually reduce the nation’s dependence on imported gasoline and 
reduce environmental pollution while at the same time creating a commercially viable industry that 
can generate sustainable domestic jobs. The NREAP further outlines the intention of the federal 
government of Nigeria to incorporate biofuels into the transport fuel mix. Currently, there is a ban 
on the import of two-stroke motorcycles, and the use of motorcycles for commercial purposes has 
also been banned in certain parts of major cities such as Abuja and Lagos. There are also regulations 
guiding vehicle emissions standards for all new and imported vehicles (Opara, 2011; George, 2020). 
The launch of the National Automotive Industry Development Plan in 2014 attracted the interest 
of leading international carmakers and led to the resumption of small-scale vehicle assembly in 
the country. According to the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), 
there are 31  licensed producers of cars, trucks and buses currently operating in Nigeria with a 
combined installed capacity of 205 000 vehicles a year, though far fewer numbers are produced 
due to huge funding, infrastructure and capacity gaps. In early 2019, the NADDC stated that only 
nine of the assemblers were active. Consequently, in March 2020, as a mark of relative success, the 
government commissioned USD 1 billion worth of locally assembled vehicles which were made by 
17 companies (U.S. Department of Trade, 2021). In all, it appears the high import tariff regime aimed 
at discouraging imports and spurring local assembly has not yet achieved its goal. 
After several attempts to reform Nigeria’s downstream oil sector, the Buhari administration has 
taken steps to reduce fossil fuel subsidies and move to a market-based pricing regime for gasoline 
in the wake of the oil price crash (Gupte, 2020). The subsidy removal may impact the fuel mix 
of Nigeria’s transport sector. The proportion of private vehicles that run on diesel is negligible, 
with commercial vehicle owners also opting to run petrol vehicles wherever possible. Hence, it is 
expected that if alternative vehicle fuels become cheaper than gasoline, many car owners may 
consider a switch to the less expensive fuel. To make this scenario possible, on 1 December 2020, 
the Nigerian government launched its National Gas Expansion Programme aimed at distributing 
LPG across gas stations in order to promote the wider use of gas in vehicles (Reed, 2020).With the renewed interest of the government in revamping the rail system, and its railway 
modernisation initiative seeking to replace the existing narrow-gauge system with the wider 
standard-gauge system – while allowing high-speed train operations on the railway network, it is 
expected that a substantial amount of road travel demand will shift to rail in the future (AfricaNews, 
2020; Clowes, 2021). 
3.5 Industry sector
The Nigerian industry sector can be split into several subsectors such as food, beverages and 
tobacco; basic metal (iron and steel); chemicals and pharmaceuticals; non-metallic mineral products; 
electrical and electronics; paper and pulp; textiles and leather; domestic and industrial plastic and 
rubber; motor vehicle and miscellaneous assembly; and wood and wood products. The energy 
demand of Nigerian industry sector has grown substantially over the years at a CAGR of 4.61%, from 
2.13 Mtoe in 1990 to around 7.51 Mtoe in 2018 (IEA, 2021). Figure 9 shows the industry sector’s fuel 
mix, which includes natural gas, fuel oil, coal, electricity and other derived products, with biomass 
being the most consumed fuel in the sector. Regarding renewable energy systems beyond biomass, 
the use of solar for industrial thermal applications is nearly absent in the country.

Figure 9 Total final energy consumption in industry in 2015 (PJ) based on model results and validated 
through a range of stakeholder engagement The Nigerian industry sector remains one of the major challenges facing the country. The sector 
has failed to implement the crucial structural reform necessary for it to play a leading role in 
economic growth and development. The sector is structurally weak and basic industries such as 
iron, steel and petrochemicals are not fully developed. Many manufacturers depend entirely on 
imports for machinery, equipment and spare parts. These factors have led previous development 
plans to describe the Nigerian manufacturing sector as one of “mere assembly plants”. In addition, 
the skilled workforce necessary to guarantee competitiveness in the modern-day dynamic and 
globalised world is lacking. Consequently, the sector is unable to attract the necessary investment 
for economic growth and remains an insubstantial player in the economy. 
With respect to technologies, Nigeria’s industrial sector is characterised by inefficient technologies 
and processes (Oyedepo et al., 2015). For instance, the wet process for cement production, which 
consumes relatively more energy, still exists in Nigeria (Ohunakin et al., 2013). The National Energy 
Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) target for high-energy-consuming sectors (e.g. industry) is that 
energy efficiency will increase by at least 50% compared with baseline. 
3.6 Agriculture sector 
Although relatively small in energy terms, the agricultural sector plays an important role in the Nigerian 
economy as it provides livelihood for around 70% of rural dwellers. Primary agriculture accounts for 
just around 1% of total final energy demand. The energy demand of the Nigerian agriculture sector 
has remain relatively sTable over the years at around 4 kilotonnes of oil equivalent (IEA, 2021). The fuel 
mix of the Nigerian agriculture sector mainly consists of diesel, gasoline and kerosene.

Figure 10 Total final energy consumption in agriculture in 2015 (PJ) based on model results and validated 
through a range of stakeholder engagement Diesel is the most important energy source in the agricultural sector and accounts for more 
than half of the energy consumed, and it is primarily used to power irrigation pumps and 
fuel vehicles, such as tractors and combine harvesters. Diesel is used to run diesel irrigation 
pumps. A small amount of electricity is used to power grid-based irrigation pumps. Renewable 
energy technology application is still at a nascent stage of deployment in the sector with just 
a few solar water irrigation pumps installed in the country. In terms of technological options, 
Nigeria’s agriculture is still underdeveloped and mainly depends on manual labour. With the 
anticipated future mechanisation, growth in population and corresponding food demand, energy 
consumption of the sector is expected to increase substantially. While the federal government 
of Nigeria has developed several policies for the country’s agriculture sector, such as the 
Agricultural Promotion Policy, many energy-related developments in the sector have been at 
state levels. For instance, in 2018, the Sokoto state government awarded a contract for the 
construction of 250 solar-powered water schemes, which will be developed in rural areas across 
the state’s 23 local government areas (Solar Business Hub, 2018). However, the impact of some 
of these schemes remains to be seen.
3.7 Power sector 
Nigeria’s electricity supply system can be grouped into two: centralised (grid-connected) and 
decentralised (off-grid) systems. The centralised system consists of the large-scale generation 
of electricity at centralised facilities such as large hydro and thermal plants. The decentralised 
electricity supply system consists of a few kilowatts to megawatt capacities such as captive diesel 
and gasoline generator sets as well as renewable energy technologies (such as solar home systems, 
streetlights and mini-grids).
Figure 11 presents total on-grid and off-grid installed capacity. The total installed capacity of gridbased systems is around 13 GW. However, today’s available on-grid peak generation varies and 
hovers around 4.5 GW. Nigeria’s on-grid generation is dominated by natural gas power stations 
(86%) and large hydropower plants (14%). However, unavailability of gas, machine breakdowns, 
seasonal water shortages and limited grid capacity have severely limited the operational 
performance of these power plants (Yetano Roche et al., 2020). This situation has led to led to 
acute shortages of electricity supply across the country with blackouts lasting for several hours in 
a day. The situation has also made many households and business units result to self-generation 
of off-grid electricity using diesel and gasoline generator sets as back-up. In terms of installed 
capacity, there is considerable uncertainty about the total capacity of fossil fuel-based selfgeneration. However, in accordance with the number of generators imported annually into the 
country, it is assumed that around 15 GW of diesel and petrol-based generation capacity were 
available in the country as of 2015 (Solar Plaza, 2017), while another study suggests around 30.5 GW
(Tambari, Dioha and Failler, 2020).Today, around 84% of urban households use back-up power supply systems such as fossil diesel/
gasoline generators and/or solar-based systems, while about 86% of the companies in Nigeria own 
or share a generator (Ley, Gaines and Ghatikar, 2015; Elinwa, Ogbeba and Agboola, 2021). Given 
the several million captive generators imported into the country, Nigeria leads Africa as the highest 
importer of generators and is also one of the largest importers worldwide. Nigeria’s erratic power 
supply systems and the relatively expensive captive generation negatively impacts the economy 
from the residential to the industry sector. Owing to the high costs of captive generation, households 
and small and medium-sized enterprises spend between two and three times more on kerosene, 
diesel and petrol than they do on electricity from the grid (All On, 2016). In industry, government 
figures suggest that the cost of self-generating power makes Nigerian products approximately onethird more expensive than imports (FMITI, 2014). For these reasons Nigeria needs to improve the 
provision of electricity in the country in terms of both access and reliability in order to reduce the 
use of captive diesel and gasoline generators. 
The transformation of Nigeria’s electricity supply system is plagued with several challenges, some of 
which are common to both the centralised and decentralised systems. The main challenges facing 
the entire power sector include inadequate financing, relatively high investment risks and policy 
uncertainty (Latham & Watkins, 2016). The setbacks facing the centralised system are insufficient 
generation capacity, weak transmission and distribution infrastructures, gas supply constraints, 
seasonality of water levels, and governance (Latham & Watkins, 2016; Wijeratne et al., 2016). Recent 
policy developments such as those that were intended to meet the goals of the National Policy 
on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency aimed to address aforementioned challenges include 
the feed-in tariffs for renewable energy, new metering regulations and guidelines allowing large 
consumers to purchase power directly from generating companies.

Note: CSP = concentrated solar power; TWh = terawatt hours.Nigeria has a huge potential off-grid market whether based on solar photovoltaic (PV) mini-grids 
or through solar home systems. Currently, based on life-cycle assessment, stand-alone solar PV 
systems are already cost-competitive compared with conventional diesel and gasoline generators 
used in the country as back-up (Esan et al., 2019). However, solar PV systems have higher initial 
capital outlay, which makes them unattractive for the poor consumers. Some of the key barriers for 
investments in the Nigerian decentralised renewables space include poor consumer affordability 
and poor enabling environment (Latham & Watkins, 2016). Recent policies and programmes, such 
as the 2016 mini-grid regulation introduced by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission 
and government removal of import duties on some solar components, aim to ameliorate the 
aforementioned challenges (NERC, 2016; Department for International Development, 2019). 
While the Nigerian power sector continues to struggle, poor financing remains the key bottleneck 
to lack of progress. The Nigerian power sector will require substantially more investment to achieve 
constant power supply. In terms of improving electricity access, around USD 34.5 billion in total 
investment will be required to provide electricity access to all households by 2030 (Ohiare, 2015). 
The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) suggests that rehabilitation and expansion of the grid 
will require an annual investment of USD  1  billion for the next ten years (TCN and PMU, 2017). 
Currently, the World Bank is financing a USD 486 million International Development Association 
credit for the Nigerian Electricity Transmission Access Project, to support the development of 
Nigeria’s transmission system (World Bank, 2018). The African Development Bank, which is already 
working with the country on a USD  410  million transmission project, has pledged to invest an 
additional USD 200 million through the Rural Electrification Agency, in order to expand electricity 
access in the country (AfDB, 2020). Recently, the Nigerian federal government signed a six-year deal 
with Germany’s Siemens AG for a three-phase electrification project aimed at increasing Nigeria’s 
power to 25 000 megawatts (MW) that amounts to NGN 1.15 trillion (around USD 3.8 billion [2020])
(U.S. Department of Trade, 2021).
Around USD 34.5 billion in total
investment will be required to provide 
electricity access to all households
by 2030.The institutional structure of the Nigerian electricity sector is presented in Figure 12 as featured in 
Adeyanju et al. (2020) and is composed of a range of different institutions.
With respect to transmission, the TCN manages the electricity transmission network in Nigeria. TCN 
is one of 18 companies that were unbundled from the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) 
in April 2004 and is a product of a merger of the system and transmission operations parts of 
PHCN. It was incorporated in November 2005 and issued a transmission licence on 1 July 2006. 
TCN’s licensed activities include electricity transmission, system operation and electricity trading. It 
is responsible for evacuating electric power generated by the electricity GenCos and wheeling it to 
DisCos. It provides the important transmission infrastructure between the GenCos and the DisCos’ 
feeder substations across the country.

Source: Adeyanju et al. (2020)Nigerias transmission network consists of high-voltage substations with a total (theoretical) 
transmission wheeling capacity of 7.5 GW and over 20 000 kilometres of transmission lines (NERC, 
2021). Currently, transmission wheeling capacity (5.3 GW) is far below the total installed generation 
capacity of around 13  GW. The entire infrastructure is essentially radial without redundancies, 
thus creating inherent reliability issues. The grid is characterised by the poor voltage profile in the 
network (especially in the north due to its radial nature). Overloaded transmission lines and high 
technical and non-technical losses are a regular feature. The average transmission losses are around 
7.4%, which is relatively high compared with emerging countries’ benchmarks of 2-6% (NERC, 2021). 
The transmission system also experiences a number of system collapses during the year. This shows 
that there exists critical infrastructure and operational challenges in the transmission subsector 
of the industry. IRENA’s West Africa Planning report focused primarily on the regional expansion 
of the centralised power sector in the region and demonstrated the benefits of co-operation in 
power system expansion to Nigeria and the wider region out to 2030 (IRENA, 2018a). International 
transmission with other countries is limited to two lines with Benin (686 MW) and Niger (186 MW) 
(IRENA, 2018a). A new 650 MW line is also planned as part of the Nigeria-Benin-Niger-Burkina-Faso 
Power Interconnection Project (also known as the North Backbone Project) which is expected to be 
commissioned in 2022 (AfDB, 2021). Moving forward, deeper system integration within the Western 
Africa Power Pool will enable a more reliable power supply regionally and offer Nigeria the chance 
to export power to the wider region.RENEWABLE 04 ENERGY OUTLOOKThe previous sections have outlined the energy context in Nigeria and some of the opportunities and 
challenges that lie ahead. However, Nigeria’s energy system is highly dynamic, and the government 
would benefit from periodically re-evaluating longer-term energy goals to reflect changing market 
dynamics and priorities for the country. This section presents the International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA) Renewable Energy Roadmap (REmap) analysis and provides an outlook on the 
medium-term potential of renewable energy in the country. 
The macroeconomic factors that apply to any country serve as the basis of its development trajectory 
and also play a key role in determining its future energy demand trajectory and corresponding 
emissions. Table 4 displays these factors as has been assumed in this study for Nigeria, for both 
the Planned Energy Scenario (PES) and the Transforming Energy Scenario (TES). A further more 
detailed description of these assumptions can be seen in Appendix B.

others, a national target for 75% electrification rate 
by 2020 and a reduction of electricity generation, 
transmission and distribution losses from 15-40% in 
2013 to less than 10% by 2020. 
Energy Commission 
of NigeriaFor the PES, it was assumed that the various programmes outlined in the Nigerian energy/climate 
policies would be realised. The main policy documents that served as the base for the PES scenario are:
• NEP
• NREAP 
• NEEAP
• NDC
• Nigeria SEforALL Action Agenda 
• RESIP
The stakeholder review workshop held in Abuja in January 2020 was instrumental in harmonising 
these various plans and policies with the latest developments in the country that have occurred 
since these documents were published. The final workshop held in Abuja in December 2022 was 
also essential in confirming the final study results were nationally representative. However, the 
other policy programmes shown in Table 5 which are not explicitly stated in these aforementioned 
documents have supported the development of the scenarios in terms of targets and structure 
overall. Further information in this regard for each sector and key technologies are available in 
Appendix B.
In addition, it is assumed that diffusion of efficient and new technological options will continue 
based on previous and likely future trends without any substantial extra policy interventions. 
Where there was doubt on the feasibility of policy targets/frameworks, stakeholders’ opinions were 
taken accordingly. There were also additional scenarios to explore the impacts of differing growth 
trajectories as discussed in section 2 to help provide a deeper understanding of sensitivity of the 
pathways developed to these assumptions.
The proceeding sections present the development of the Nigerian energy system out to 2050 based 
on these aforementioned assumptions and methodology in terms of demand projection (as presented 
in Appendix B) and how these demands are met in accordance with current policies and plans using 
The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) modelling framework (as presented in Appendix B). 
Primary energy requirement
Figure 13 shows the primary energy supply for the PES which represents a view on energy supply 
based on current and planned policies under a 7% GDP growth rate. Here, the total primary energy 
supply reaches 5 138 petajoules (PJ) by 2030 and 13 044 PJ by 2050. This indicates a rise by about 
five times in 35 years largely attributed to the substantial expansion of the economy and population.
Bioenergy is the dominant energy source in 2015 but its share declines from 43% in 2015 to 
33% by 2030 and 27% by 2050, while supply rises from 1 129 PJ in 2015 to 1 622 PJ by 2030 and 
3 478 PJ by 2050. Although the magnitude of supply of crude oil increases over the modelling 
time frame, its share in total primary energy mix is set to decline after 2030. The share of crude 
oil in the supply mix rises from 41% in 2015 to 45% by 2030 and then declines to 33% by 2050. The 2050 decline in the share of crude oil in primary energy supply mix is on account of the 
expansion of the utilisation of other energy sources such as natural gas as well as renewables.
For the modelling time frame, upward growth is observed in natural gas. Figure 13 shows that the 
share of natural gas rose from 18% in 2015 to around 24% by 2030 and 2050. Despite the magnitude 
of coal rising in the supply mix from 5 PJ in 2015 to 39 PJ (2030) and 696 PJ (2050), its share 
remains around 1% by 2030 and 6% by 2050. This can be attributed to the low domestic utilisation 
of coal in the country. Analysis shows that “other renewables” will increase from 17 PJ in 2015 to 
around 161 PJ by 2030 and 512 PJ by 2050. The share of “other renewables” in primary energy mix 
will grow modestly from less than 1% in 2015 to around 3.5% in 2030 and 4.3% by 2050. Thus, by 
2030 and 2050 in the PES, renewables (hydro, bioenergy and “other renewables”) will account for 
around 37% (2030) and 33% (2050) of the primary energy supply mix.
Carbon emissions 
The total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the energy sector increase from 119 million tonnes 
(Mt) in 2015 to 201 Mt in 2030 and 516 Mt in 2050 Figure 14, which corresponds to an increase of 
over threefold in 35 years. In the PES, the unconditional NDC CO2
 emissions target for 2030 is met 
but that the conditional NDC requirement would not be. In 2015, electricity generation is the largest 
source of CO2
 emissions in the energy sector. However, by 2030, the transport sector becomes the 
largest source of CO2
 emissions in the energy sector and maintains this position up to 2050, owing 
to the huge growth of the fossil-powered transport system. In 2030, within the energy sector, PJ

Figure 13 Primary energy requirement under current plans and policies transport emissions account for 47% and increase to 59% by 2050. The decline in the share of the 
power sector in total CO2
 emissions from the energy sector can be attributed to the rapid growth of 
renewable energy technologies deployment in the power sector, which are cost-effective to install 
at scale even without additional incentives. 
Final energy demand
The total final energy demand under current and planned policies grows from 2 155 PJ in 2015 to 
3 765 PJ in 2030 and 10 351 PJ in 2050, increasing over four times in 35 years. The total final energy 
demand of the transport sector grows at the fastest pace, with a compound annual growth rate
of 6.8%. 
Figure 15 shows that the percentage share of the residential sector in final energy demand is largest 
in 2030, accounting for around 35% of the total. However, by 2050, the transport sector overtakes 
it and contributes the most to final energy demand with a share of about 45%. The share of the 
residential sector is seen to fall over time since the size of its energy consumption grows slowly, 
while that of the commercial and agriculture sectors grows more slowly across study horizon. The 
renewable energy share of total final energy consumption (TFEC) is also anticipated to decrease 
along the study horizon from just below 50% in 2015 to about 40% in 2050. The substantial growth 
in renewable energy use in industry, as shown in Table 6, does not mitigate the rapid expansion of 
the transport sector, where the renewable energy share is only 7% by 2050. The growth in demand

of TFEC it goes from 49% in 2015 to just 18% in 2050. This owes to demand growth in other sectors 
but is also due to significant efficiency gains over the period achieved through the roll-out of clean 
cooking technologies. The composition of final energy demand trajectories for each sector are 
further elaborated in the proceeding subheadings of this section.
Figure 16 further elaborates on the final energy consumption as projected in Figure 15 with the 
most notable expansion in energy use coming from gasoline, diesel and natural gas, whose use 
expands very substantially as a result of its increased use in the transport sector. Meanwhile, the 
use of biomass substantially increases out to 2050, expanding threefold in energy terms as a result 
of increased use in industrial applications while its use in the residential and commercial sectors 
reduces due to increased electrification of these end uses.

Figure 17 Final energy consumption for the residential sector under current and planned policies
Note: RE = renewable energy.Biomass continues to be an important source of energy, especially in rural areas, as it is used for 
cooking and water heating. This analysis shows that biomass will remain the dominant energy source 
by 2030 with a share of around 51%. However, with the penetration of more efficient cookstoves, as 
well as the growth of other energy services, the share of biomass in 2050 declines to 26%. 
In the residential sector, several factors have formed part of the PES in terms of the level of energy 
access and penetration of efficient and advanced appliances. In terms of electricity, 100% access to 
electricity is achieved by 2030 in the urban areas but achieved only by 2035 in the rural areas. In the 
PES, 100% access to clean cooking devices is not achieved in either rural or urban areas. 
Owing to greater appliance penetration and the rate of electrification, the electricity demand of 
the sector increases over five times from 156 PJ in 2015 to 1 012 PJ in 2050 – making electricity the 
largest contributor to the final energy demand of residential sector in 2050 (53%). With respect to 
the share of modern renewable energy in the PES, they reach 11% in 2030 and 24% in 2050, inclusive 
of the renewable share of electricity and exclusive of traditional biomass. This is, however, mitigated 
by the greater penetration of efficient refrigerators and air conditioners, which are assumed to rise 
in both rural and urban households from 20% in 2015 to about 40% in 2030 and 70% in 2050. Given 
that 100% electrification is anticipated to be realised after 2035 (in rural areas), the use of kerosene 
lanterns for lighting stops after this. Efficient lighting technologies such as compact fluorescent 
lamps (CFLs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) also penetrate into the rural households at a faster 
rate while incandescent bulbs are phased out completely by 2030. 
These changes in demand and efficiency in supply of energy service demands, as shown in 
Figure 18, have a profound effect on the shares of energy demand of different energy services, with 
the strongest being in terms of the reduced share of cooking and increased share other electrical 
appliances.

Figure  19 illustrates the final energy demand of the commercial sector by fuel for the planned 
energy scenario. The final energy demand in the commercial sector grows from 260 PJ in 2015 to 
417 PJ in 2030 and 907 PJ by 2050. The two primary fuel sources for the rising energy demand in 
this industry are electricity and biomass. In comparison to the base year value from 2015, electricity 
consumption in the sector thus rises by approximately 66% in 2030 and by 277% in 2050.
This stems from the energy service demands of the commercial sector for lighting, air conditioning, 
cooking and other electrical appliances being met with more efficient appliances over time due to the 
push for energy efficiency improvements in the NEEAP and NREAP. With respect to the renewable 
energy share, the commercial sector reaches a share of about 50% in 2030 and 55% in 2050. 
However, as shown in Figure 19, despite the changes in efficiencies of appliances, the composition is 
only expected to shift modestly with cooking decreasing and other electrical appliances increasing 
due to efficiency improvements and demand growth with the expansion of the economy driving a 
greater breadth of energy service demands. 
The total final energy demand
overall under current and planned 
policies increases over four times
in 35 years.

Figure 19 Final energy consumption for the commercial sector under current and planned policiesTransport
Nigeria’s transport sector is dominated (over 98%) by fossil gasoline and diesel, and Figure 21 reflects 
this in the final energy demand of the transport sector by fuel under planned and current policies. 
The final energy demand of the transport sector grows from 418 PJ in the base year to 1 137 PJ 
by 2030 and 4 172 PJ by 2050. This sizeable increase in demand by the transport sector can be 
ascribed to the immense growth in use of private cars – a more energy-intensive mode of transport 
for passenger movement. As income levels grow, the purchase of private vehicles increases and this 
leads to higher growth of transport energy demand. In 2015, gasoline and diesel were used to meet 
around 99% of the sector’s energy demand. The Nigerian government launched its National Gas 
Expansion Programme in late 2020; this programme promoted the distribution of CNG across gas 
stations operated by state energy company Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (Central Bank 
of Nigeria, 2020). Thus, in line with this the share of diesel and gasoline in the transport sector is 
anticipated to reduce to 90% in 2030 and 70% in 2050 on account of the gradual adoption of CNG, 
biofuels and electric vehicles (EVs) in the PES.

Figure 21 Final energy consumption for the transport sector under current and planned policiesThe National Biofuel Policy (NNPC, 2007) and the NREAP both push for the expansion of biofuels 
usage in the transport sector. Using first-generation biofuels, the target of the NREAP is to achieve 
57% ethanol as share of gasoline consumption by 2030 and 17% biodiesel as share of diesel and 
fuel oil consumption by 2030. However, these are not assumed to be met in the PES with only very 
modest fractions achieved by 2050 as a conservative assumption based on workshop consultations.
The NDC and the SEforALL Action Agenda envisage the use of domestic gas resources for cars; for 
this reason the PES assumes a modest increase in the shares of CNG- and biofuels-fuelled vehicles. It 
is also anticipated that the penetration of biofuels vehicles will be favoured more in comparison with 
EVs due to the presence of national biofuel policies and a lack of a framework for EV deployment. 
The main shifts that occur in the PES in terms of the share of demand are shown in Figure 22 with 
a key feature being that passenger car transport demand increases strongly out to 2030 and far 
outpaces growth in public transport, which then picks up at the latter end of the study horizon. It 
is notable that despite the substantial growth, the share that it represents of transport demand 
remains the same in 2050 as in 2015, but the absolute growth in demand is an eightfold increase. 
Energy use in freight is also quite pronounced; though it decreases in proportion by a third of 
overall transport demand, its growth in absolute energy terms equates to approximately a fivefold 
increase. This scenario does not favour the penetration of EVs in Nigeria’s transport system due to 
the lack of a dedicated EV policy in the country.
The PES shows rising energy service demands to meet the growing needs of a more affluent and 
expanding Nigerian population. By relying on internal combustion engines fuelled by fossil fuels in 
the most part, this has profound implications on the national primary energy requirement, import 
requirements and local air pollution; alternatives to this will be considered in the TES that positively 
affect these factors while meeting the growing needs of the Nigerian economy.

Figure 22 Percentage contribution to transport energy demand under current and planned policiesIndustry
The final energy demand of the industrial sector by fuel under current and planned policies grows 
from 405 PJ in 2015 to 872 PJ by 2030 and 3 336 PJ by 2050, as Figure 23 Illustrates. The NEEAP 
target for high-energy-consuming sectors (e.g.  industrial sectors) is that efficient energy will 
increase by at least 50% compared with baseline. However, the NEEAP does not provide baseline 
values and it does not have specific targets for key appliances/processes in the various subsectors 
of industry. Hence, in the PES, efficiency improvement is considered as per the historical trend and 
in line with the conventional technological options in the Nigerian manufacturing sector.
Biomass is used to serve over half of the sector’s energy requirements with an accompanying energy 
consumption which rises by nearly seven times across 35  years. This immense growth in industrial 
energy consumption is largely due to the growth of manufacturing of energy-intensive products (such 
as cement, steel, fertiliser, etc.) for infrastructural requirements and the growth in the demand for food, 
among others. Natural gas and petroleum products are the next most-consumed fuels by the sector. 
The renewable energy share in the current and planned policies reaches 67% in 2030 and 72% in 2050. 
The continuous liberalisation of the Nigerian market is predicted to lead to energy-intensive industries, 
such as those of cement and fertiliser, improving their energy efficiency levels by adopting stateof-the-art and advanced technologies. The increased competition in such industries will help make 
energy savings and efficiency through their impact on costs and profitability, though this impact 
will vary depending on the sectors and corresponding technologies. In the cement sector, the use 
of wet process is minimised and phased out by 2050 and the use of dry processes with 4-6 stage 
preheater + precalciner is expanded to account for 100% of cement production processes by 2050. 
Generally, it is assumed as per the NEEAP that the specific energy consumption (SEC) of these 
large-scale industrial subsectors will improve, but it has been implemented in this study by the 
adoption of new and advanced technologies (which have better SEC) over the study time frame.

energy demand out to 2050, as shown in Figure 24 
Agriculture
Energy in the agriculture sector is primarily needed for irrigation and land preparation. In Figure 25 
the final energy demand under current and planned policies for the agriculture sector by fuel is 
shown to rise from 8 PJ in 2015 to 12 PJ in 2030 and 30 PJ in 2050. Diesel is the main fuel used in 
the sector and it is mainly applied in irrigation water pumping as well as in tractors.

Figure 25 Final energy consumption for the agriculture sector under current and planned policiesIn 2015, gasoline was assessed as having a share of 55%,, diesel 45% and grid-based irrigation 
pumps 5%, with the share of solar-based pumps serving demand being negligible. Over the horizon 
of the study it is expected that the share of solar-based irrigation pumps reaches 5% by 2030 and 
10% by 2050 while the share of advanced electric grid-powered pumpsets in irrigation is assumed 
to gradually increase to 8% by 2030 and 25% by 2050. In addition, the share of biofuel-powered 
tractors increases from 0% in 2015 to 5% by 2030 and 15% by 2050. Furthermore, the share of 
efficient diesel-based tractors in the sector is assumed to gradually improve. Thus, the renewable 
energy share in the agricultural sector is expected to remain low under planned and current policy, 
going from a share of about 1% today to 4% in 2030 and 7% in 2050. 
Power sector
Total installed capacity, off-grid included, grows from 33 GW in 2015 to around 56 GW by 2030 and 
136 GW by 2050, reaching a renewable share of 60% in 2050, driven primarily by the cost reductions 
of renewable energy technologies which make them essential considerations in the expansion of 
capacity. This corresponds to an increase of over three times in overall generation capacity compared 
with the base year (2015). The analysis shows that captive generation (oil) will decline to 12.1 GW by 
2030 and then will be totally flushed out of Nigeria’s installed power capacity mix by 2050. However, 
this understanding is based on the assumption that the PES is fully implemented. Despite the expansion 
of renewable energy capacity in this scenario, fossil generation (gas, oil and coal) are set to dominate 
the total installed capacity by 2030 with a share of around 53%. However, by 2050, the share of 
fossil generation declines to 35.4% on account of the expansion of renewable energy capacity in the 
system as well as the development of nuclear power. The share of renewables (including large hydro) 
in total capacity by 2030 is 47% and by 2050 is 61%. Off-grid photovoltaic (PV) systems continue 
to account for the maximum share of the total installed capacity of renewable energy technologies.
Off-grid systems currently supply the majority of capacity at a share of 62%, which drops to 45% by 
2030 and 22% by 2050, indicating a more robust centralised power system serving the majority of 
capacity needs in Nigeria by the end of the decade.

Figure 26 Percentage contribution to agricultural energy demand under current and planned policiesIn terms of power generation, the evolution over time corresponds to the expansion of generation 
capacity, which shows that total electricity production increases from 112 terawatt hours (TWh) 
in 2015 to 220 TWh in 2030 and 566 TWh in 2050. The share of renewable energy in total power 
generation rises from 9.2% in 2015 to 35.5% in 2030 and 42% in 2050. off-grid PV systems account 
for the largest source of renewable energy power generation by 2030. However, by 2050, large 
hydro becomes the largest source of renewable power generation, followed by utility-scale PV 
and then off-grid PV. In reality, this may not be the case as the choice of technologies is not always 
based on least-cost solutions.

IRENA and IAEA to help African Union develop continental power master plan
IRENA and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have been selected as modelling partners 
for the development of the African Continental Power Systems Master Plan (CMP). The initiative is 
led by the African Union Development Agency (AUDA) with the technical and financial support of 
the European Union, and is aimed at establishing a long-term continent-wide planning process. The 
two agencies’ modelling tools will be the official planning models utilised in this initiative and both 
agencies will lead the development of an electricity master plan that promotes access to affordable, 
reliable and sustainable electricity supplies across the continent.
A unified transmission network in Africa will enable inter-country trade between African countries 
as well as cross-continental trade with Europe and Asia, via existing links in North Africa, allowing 
African countries to source electricity from a wide range of competitive, clean energy sources. It will 
also create beneficial socio-economic opportunities by increasing interregional access to affordable 
African renewable energy resources within the continent, fostering investment opportunities and job 
growth and ultimately contributing to the region’s sustainable development.
The urgency of this task is underlined by the prospect of carbon lock-in. Existing plans in eastern 
and southern African countries include more than 100 GW of new coal-fired power plants by 2040 
– the development of which would triple CO2
 emissions to 1 200 Mt per year. Under the CMP, power 
generation options will be reviewed and reconsidered to maximise socio-economic benefits while 
simultaneously minimising emissions.
IRENA and the IAEA, as modelling partners, will support African stakeholders with the development 
of the CMP identifying surplus and deficit regions/countries in Africa in terms of electricity generation 
and demand. This will help identify the most cost-effective ways of expanding clean electricity 
generation and transmission infrastructure across the African continent.
IRENA and IAEA will also train AUDA-NEPAD (New Partnership for Africa’s Development) staff and 
Power Pool experts on the use of the modelling tools, including IRENA’s System Planning Test (SPLAT) 
models using the IAEA’s Model for Energy Supply System Alternatives and Their General Environmental 
Impacts (MESSAGE) tool, and support the team in the development of the CMP, ensuring knowledge 
transfer and capacity building.
The MESSAGE-SPLAT capacity expansion models are a key component and product of IRENA’s 
support to African countries. Built using the MESSAGE software, the agency has developed SPLAT 
models covering 47 African countries across the five African power pools. They have been used in 
IRENA’s capacity-building programmes on energy planning across the continent.
The IAEA and IRENA co-operate on energy planning with a view to enhancing the effectiveness 
and impact of capacity-building efforts by joining the complementary competencies of the two 
organisations. This process could be helpful for Nigeria, in particular with respect to the TES, as it 
would show how the Nigeria power sector would operate within a broader regional power system 
which in turn would allow an understanding be gained of the key benefits of regional integration of 
renewable power and how it could be achieved.4.2 Transforming Energy Scenario to 2050
This section discusses the TES, which is an assessment of the accelerated potential of renewable 
energy in Nigeria. The key findings relate to the REmap Options, which are renewable energy 
technologies and sources that have additional potential to be utilised or deployed on top of 
developments in the PES. This section’s main aim, therefore, is to outline where the additional 
potential of renewable energy lies in Nigeria, both in meeting the aims of existing energy policies/
plans and also increasing renewables even further. Further information in this regard for each 
sector and key technology is available in Appendix B. The REmap Options explore the potential 
to increase renewables across all sectors of Nigeria’s energy system – it uses a mixed approach 
aimed at maximising renewable energy deployment and looks at options in power, buildings (both 
residential and commercial), transport, industry and agriculture applications. It also evaluates these 
renewable options in terms of their costs, benefits and investment needs. The TES is not intended 
to replace the PES; rather, it seeks to provide another development pathway strongly based on 
renewable energy technologies and can serve as a complement to the existing energy policies and 
plans.
Drivers for renewable energy 
The REmap Options identify areas across Nigeria’s entire energy system where additional potential 
for using renewable energy lies. The criteria for selecting these options are not based solely on cost, 
but also on additional motivating factors that incline governments to support increased deployment 
of renewable energy technologies. These factors can include efforts to improve energy security, 
develop the domestic value chain and the resulting job creation, and to reduce adverse health 
effects, environmental damage and mitigation of climate change. 
The REmap Options do show that renewables are in many cases the least-cost option for energy 
supply in Nigeria, especially in areas not connected to the grid. The cost case is even more appealing 
when considering benefits that arise from reduced air pollution and CO2
 emissions. As the costing 
section shows, the grouping of technologies identified in REmap not only reduce energy system 
costs as a whole – meaning lower overall energy costs for consumers – but also result in at least 
twice as much savings from reduced externality costs due to lower levels of air pollution and 
environmental damage. 
Fossil fuels carry price volatility risk, particularly where they are imported. Valuing this risk is difficult, 
but should be considered when evaluating energy system investments. The renewables identified in 
this section either have no fuel price volatility (such as for solar, wind or hydro resources), or in the 
case of bioenergy are based largely on the local agro-economic conditions, which generally affords 
government more control over the market and certainty on how costs will develop over time. 
The sections that follow go into more depth on what additional potential is available, in which 
technologies and sectors. They also quantify those technologies and sources in terms of their costs, 
benefits and investment needs. Below is a short summary of the key findings: Box 2
Renewable power generation cost trends, 2010-2020: A decade of falling costs
The decade 2010 to 2020 represents a remarkable period of cost reduction for solar and wind power 
technologies. The combination of targeted policy support and industry drive has seen renewable 
electricity from solar and wind power go from an expensive niche to head-to-head competition with 
fossil fuels for new capacity. In the process, it has become clear that renewables will become the 
backbone of the electricity system and help decarbonise electricity generation, with costs lower than 
a business-as-usual future.
New solar and wind projects are increasingly undercutting even the cheapest and least sustainable 
of existing coal-fired power plants. IRENA analysis suggests 800 GW of existing coal-fired capacity 
has operating costs higher than new utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind, including (2020)
USD  0.005/kWhfor integration costs as illustrated in Figure  28. Replacing these coal-fired plants 
would cut annual system costs by (2020) USD 32 billion per year and reduce annual CO2
 emissionsby 
around 3 gigatonnes of CO2 (IRENA, 2021b).
These cost reductions represent an opportunity for Nigeria, given its high level of renewable energy 
resources. These cost reductions are a key driver in their expansion in the TES in addition to the 
non-cost benefits they harness such as their ability to reduce pollution and exposure to fossil fuel price 
fluctuations. Levelised electricity costs (2020 USD/kWh)

Source: IRENA (2021b).• In the TES the share of renewables increases across all sectors, with the largest increase in the 
power sector, which in turn drives increased shares of renewables in the end-use sectors. 
• Overall, modern renewable energy (i.e. renewable energy excluding traditional biomass) can 
provide 10% of Nigeria’s energy supply in TFEC in 2030 and 44% in 2050, up from just 1% in 2015 
and the 10% achieved by 2050 in the PES. 
• Modern renewables in TFEC increase from 32 PJ in 2015 to 286 PJ in 2030 and 1 077 PJ in 2050 
in the PES. In the TES this reaches far higher levels of 714 PJ in 2030 and 3 186 PJ in 2050, an 
increase on the PES of over 300%.
• By 2050, the power mix moves from being one dominated by distributed diesel and gasoline 
generators to a much more diverse mix of technologies that includes sizeable generation from 
solar PV (both centralised and decentralised), concentrated solar power (CSP) and bioenergy. 
Power generation from solar PV is now the largest generation source by 2050 (38% of generation 
– of which about 30% is centralised and 70% is decentralised), followed by hydropower
(17% of generation) and natural gas (16% of generation). In the TES by 2030, 84% of generation 
is supplied from renewable sources, a doubling over the share in the PES by 2050 and up from 
9% in 2015. 
• Renewables use in the end-use sectors is also important in the TES, with about 10% of fuel use 
in all end-use sectors being met by modern renewables in 2030 and 44% in 2050, including 
bioenergy and solar thermal.

Total primary energy supply 47% 37% 47% 33% 57%• This analysis identifies additional renewable energy potential across all sectors of the Nigeria 
energy landscape. However, the analysis shows that the largest potential, and where the largest 
growth occurs, is in the power sector, where it increases the share of renewables in end-use 
sectors. This is especially true in the residential sector, where electricity can supply 60% of energy 
demand by 2050, and the commercial sector, where it can supply 72% of demand. 
• The power sector sees substantial growth due to untapped renewable potential, particularly for 
solar PV and hydropower. In both the PES and the TES, the share of renewable energy in TFEC 
that comes from renewable power is always over half. In fact, 73% of the renewables in total 
final energy consumed in the PES is supplied by electricity in 2050, driven primarily by the cost 
reduction anticipated in solar PV deployment. 
Overall, modern renewable energy can provide 44% of Nigerian TFEC by 2050, quadrupling the 
share in the PES and up from just 1% in 2015, as shown in Table 7. At the sector level, the largest 
share is in the power sector where over 84% of electricity comes from renewable sources by 2050. 
Across the end-use sectors the share of renewable energy in fuels and direct uses varies from 36% 
to 69% inclusive of the renewable energy share of electricity. 
Looking at how these percentages translate into energy supply when viewed in final energy terms, 
several key findings are evident. Renewable power in Nigeria represents a substantial share of its 
modern renewable energy. The renewable power mix changes, moving to being a much more diverse 
mix of technologies that includes the majority of generation coming from solar PV. In fact, while 
power generation from natural gas remains substantial, oil-fired generation is eliminated in the TES 
by 2030 and the largest source of generation is solar PV, which is closely followed by hydropower as 
the second largest mode of generation. Overall, renewable power generation in the country increases 
over tenfold, from just 10 TWh in 2015 to 144 TWh in REmap in 2030 and 469 TWh in 2050. 
Despite the substantial potential of renewable power, direct renewable energy use must also be 
considered in buildings, industry and transport. In these end-use sectors, energy is needed in the form 
of fuels and direct use for thermal, cooking and transport applications. In fact, in final energy terms 
these non-electrical energy needs make up just under three-quarters of TFEC in the TES by 2050 and 
even more in the PES due to lower electrification of end uses. Therefore, a holistic view of energy is 
needed, taking account of the potential of renewables for heat, fuels and other direct uses. 
Bioenergy is still an important source in end-use energy applications due to its ability to be used 
for heat and transport fuel. Traditional bioenergy is the primary source for heat and cooking 
purposes in buildings (both commercial and residential) in 2015 and remains substantial out to 
2030 where it serves around 45% of energy demand in both the PES and TES. However, by 2050 
this is substantially reduced and in the TES, serves just 16% of overall energy demand in buildings 
with the profound associated health and environmental benefits. The key enabler of this reduced 
use of traditional bioenergy is electrification of cooking and heating end uses. Modern biofuels are 
applied predominantly in the transport sector where in the TES by 2050 they serve 24% demand in 
the form of biodiesel and bioethanol.Solar thermal is also an important source of renewable energy in the end-use sectors of buildings and 
industry. The technology can provide hot water for a variety of uses in different end-use sectors. In 
industry, solar thermal systems can provide low-temperature heat and preheating or other process 
heat uses. In the TES, sizeable additional potential has been identified, raising the share of industrial 
sector energy supply met with solar thermal to 29% whereas 0% is achieved in the PES. 
In total, the amount of modern renewable energy used in Nigeria increases from 32 PJ in 2015 to 
286 PJ in 2030 and 1 077 PJ in 2050 in the PES, and increases further to 714 PJ in 2030 and 3 186 PJ 
in 2050 in the TES, an increase on the PES of over 300%. This would lead to modern renewable 
energy providing 10% of Nigeria’s energy supply in TFEC in 2030 and 44% in 2050; by 2050 this 
equates to a quadrupling of the share achieved in the PES.
The proceeding sections present the energy systems of TES in more detail out to 2050 and contrasts 
it to the PES as derived using the TIMES modelling framework to allow for the differences between 
the scenarios to be more discernible and thus allow for potential policy comparison and assessment.
Primary energy supply 
The TES substantially reduces the share of fossil fuels in the Nigerian primary energy supply mix 
on account of accelerated renewables deployment. The renewable energy shares in TES are about 
47% in 2030 and 57% in 2050, as shown in Figure 29, resulting from the modelling performed in 
TIMES. Another defining characteristic of this scenario is the substantial energy savings of 22% by 
2030 and 33% by 2050 when compared with the PES. This can be ascribed to the reduction in the 
consumption of crude oil, natural gas and traditional biomass (mainly at the residential sector). 
These reductions are achieved on account of high-energy efficiency strategies implemented across 
the various demand sectors that allow the same energy service demand to be met. Compared 
with the PES, the primary supply of crude oil declines by 48% (2030) and 64% (2050) due to the 
massive roll-out of alternative fuel vehicles in the transport sector in the TES. Additionally, due 
to higher penetration of clean and improved cookstoves in the residential areas, the supply of 
bioenergy in the primary energy supply reduces by 1.2% in 2030 and 10% in 2050 compared with 
the PES. It may be observed that there is no huge decline in bioenergy supply in the TES, which may 
seem counterintuitive; this is because despite the decline in bioenergy for cooking in the residential 
sector, there is very substantial growth in demand for bioenergy in the transport and power sectors. 
The results also indicate that due to the massive upscaling of renewable energy in this scenario, 
“other renewables”, mainly composed of solar energy, will increase respectively, by 71% in 2030 and 
171% in 2050 compared with the PES. Final energy demand 
Figure 30 shows the total final energy demand out to 2050 for both the PES and the TES, as derived 
using the TIMES Nigeria model. The total final energy demand under current and planned polices 
grows from 2 037 PJ in 2015 to 3 484 PJ in 2030 and 9 183 PJ in 2050, increasing over threefold. While 
the share of renewables in the PES is rather high at 45%, once traditional biomass usage is excluded, 
modern renewables in TFEC drops to below 10%. Conversely, in the TES, modern renewables meet 
just under 50% of demand with renewables supplying 60% overall. The total final energy demand of 
the transport sector grows at the fastest pace, with an average growth rate of 6.8%. In the TES, due 
to several demand-side management measures and fuel efficiency enhancements in the demand 
technologies, the final energy demand is 2 932 PJ by 2030 and 6 755 PJ by 2050 – savings of 16% 
and 26% respectively in comparison with the PES. These results help explain the overall energy 
implication of the demand management strategies implemented in the TES. 
In both scenarios, the percentage share of the residential sector in final energy demand is largest 
in 2030, accounting for around 38% of the total energy demand. However, by 2050, the transport 
sector overtakes it and contributes the largest in final energy demand with a share of about 45%. 
The share of the residential sector is seen to fall over time since the size of its energy consumption 
grows slowly, while those of the commercial and agriculture sectors remain relatively constant 
across the modelling time frame. The lower portion of Figure 30 shows the final energy demand 
by fuel and reiterates the earlier discussions of reduced biomass usage; while traditional use of 
biomass decreases, the use of bioenergy in other sectors in terms of biodiesel and bioethanol 
drive its maintained importance in the TES. The much more efficient use of alternative and cleanburning fuels for cooking and water heating applications in the place of traditional biomass in 
particular reduce the energy input required by 26% compared with the PES in 2050 in addition to 
the tangential non-cost benefits in terms of health from reduced pollution and time saved from 
collection of wood which could be used for economically more productive uses.

• Residential
Figure 31 compares the final energy demand of the residential sector by fuel, for both the Planned 
and Transforming Energy Scenarios, resulting from the modelling performed in TIMES. In the 
TES, the final energy demand of the residential sector rises to 1 065 PJ by 2030 and 1 281 PJ by 
2050, which is about 20% and 33% lower than the demand in the planned case. This reduction 
can be clearly observed in electricity consumption, which is 23% lower by 2050. The demand 
reduction occurs due to higher diffusion of efficient appliances in the household sector such 
as very efficient refrigerators, water heaters, air conditioners, etc. It is worthwhile to note that 
100% energy access by 2030 is achieved in this scenario. Though challenging to achieve when 
considering the latest developments, its achievement would have profound benefits and thus 
these efforts need to be accelerated to achieve universal access to clean cooking in Nigeria.

the PES. It is also worth noting that improved cookstoves are up to three times more efficient 
than the conventional traditional cookstoves and substantially reduce the energy requirement for 
cooking. All these measures can help achieve a very substantial modern renewable share in sector 
which reaches 27% in 2030 and 61% in 2050.
While the TES sees 100% electricity and clean cooking access achieved in both rural and urban 
areas by 2030, there are differing diffusions of technologies in both areas to achieve this. It is also 
important to note that this would be very challenging to achieve at this point considering the current 
infiltration rate of these technologies by 2030. Cooking technologies have been diversified in this 
case with LPG stoves being the dominant choice for cooking. However, biogas has considerable 
uptake by rural households due to the local resource availability compared with that of urban 
households. Conversely, the penetration of electric stoves is assumed to be more pronounced in 
urban areas compared with rural areas due to closer proximity to the centralised grid. These show 
that differing policies and initiatives will be needed to provide accelerated energy access tailored to 
the specific needs of each area in the TES.

Figure 31 Comparison of final energy demand in the residential sector in in the Planned and Transforming 
Energy Scenarios for 2015, 2030 and 2050The composition of overall energy demand in terms of end use in the sector remains broadly the 
same as in Figure  18 with only moderate shifts in the share mainly attributed to the improved 
efficiency of appliances used and electrification of end uses; most notably are efficient lighting, 
refrigerators and air conditioners, which rise in both rural and urban households to 50% by 2030 
and to 100% by 2050.
• Commercial 
The TES for commercial buildings, similarly to residential buildings, sees final energy demand 
decrease, seeing drops of 18.2% in 2030 and 31.6% in 2050 in comparison with what is achieved 
under current plans and polices. In Figure 32 we can observe notable drops of 11% in 2030 and 
25% in 2050 re observed in the usage of electricity due to increased penetration of more efficient 
electrical appliances and cookstoves in the sector. With respect to overall renewable share, they 
reach 68% in 2030 and 77% in 2050 but when considering only modern renewables, the share 
drops to 50% in 2030 and 66% in 2050. This drop is even more pronounced in the PES due to the 
maintained importance of traditional biomass in heating and cooking applications.

Figure 32 Comparison of final energy demand in commercial buildings in in the Planned and Transforming 
Energy Scenarios for 2015, 2030 and 2050Transport sector
The TES sees final energy demand in transport rise to 1 002 PJ by 2030 and 2 846 PJ by 2050, which 
is lower than the PES by 12% and 32% respectively. Generally speaking, the share of biofuels and 
electricity in the sector increases substantially while the share of CNG use also moderately increases, 
which sees a substantial substitution of oil products in the PES. Consequently, the consumption of 
oil products declines by 29.5% in 2030 and 64.2% in 2050 compared with the PES. However, due to 
the substantial domestic resource and recent policy developments it can be seen that, even in the 
TES, CNG usage will continue to be a key part of the transport mix. 
These shifts lead to renewable energy shares reaching 16% in 2030 of final consumption in the sector 
in the TES and 39% in 2050 as seen in Figure 33. To consider the renewable energy share in this 
way, however, obscures very substantial gains in terms of electrification of the vehicle fleet. EVs are 
much more energy-efficient (often about three times more) than conventional internal combustion 
engines and thus, the absolute energy consumption shares are not reflections of the vehicle fleet 
shares. Electric private cars and taxis reach 10% by 2030 and 35% by 2050 in the TES, while biofuelbased private cars could account for 20% in 2030 and 25% in 2050 but need substantially different 
efficiencies. Modal shift also plays a key role with a considerable improvement in public transport 
in terms of rail and bus transport, where electricity serves 40% (rail) and 35% (bus) by 2050 in the 
TES, further compounding the efficiency gains of this increased electrification.

Hydrogen and its potential applications
Hydrogen as an energy carrier has the potential to play a pivotal role in the global energy transition, 
particularly in the hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as shipping, long-haul aviation, chemicals and 
seasonal storage in the power sector, where few cost-effective alternatives are available. However, 
its use has to be carefully considered due to its competition with other technologies across various 
sectors and local conditions and costs in each use case.
In a bid to encourage hydrogen adaptation, the federal foreign office of Germany established a 
hydrogen office in Abuja, Nigeria, on 9 November 2021 (Auswärtiges Amt, 2021). Given the region’s 
solar energy resources in particular, the country has a strong possibility of producing green hydrogen 
for both domestic consumption and export, using some of the lowest-cost power sources available 
today (IRENA, 2021b). Additionally, the economy of Nigeria, as a significant exporter of fossil fuels, 
may benefit from a shift to green hydrogen production and export in terms of leveraging its existing 
expertise and skills base in the production of LPG, crude oil and natural gas. Technically, hydrogen can 
be used in many different sectors, but its extensive use may not be in line with the requirements of 
a decarbonised world, where energy consumption and capacity deployment will have to be carefully 
managed. In particular, the production of green hydrogen requires dedicated renewable energy that 
could be used for other end uses. Indeed, indiscriminate use of hydrogen could then slow down the 
energy transition. This calls for priority setting in policy making. Policy priority setting for green hydrogen 
relies on assessing different factors. Some of these factors can be similar between different countries 
globally, while others are country- or region-specific. Among the global factors are the technological 
readiness of the decarbonisation solutions and the potential size of local hydrogen demand.

of hydrogen are among the highest priority end use, as alternatives are still missing in the foreseeable 
future and demand from these facilities can be large enough to allow economies of scale in production 
and infrastructure, making the shift to green hydrogen even more cost-effective in these applications.

Source: IRENA (2022b).Industry sector
As in other sectors, the final energy demand of the industry sector sees substantial reductions 
in final energy demand in the TES when compared with the PES. Total industry energy demand 
is 682  PJ in 2030 and 2 393  PJ in 2050 in the TES, which amount to savings of 22% and 28% 
when compared with the planned case respectively. A large number of new, more efficient and 
advanced technologies are introduced in the industry sector, which allows older and less efficient 
technologies to be retired. Solar-based industrial process heat is set to replace many of the 
conventional fossil- and biomass-fired systems in large-scale industries (up to 50% by 2050). The 
TES also accounts for various strategies to help reduce the specific energy consumption of all
the technologies/processes in the sector. This sees the share of modern renewables reach 14% 
in 2030 and 36% in 2050. The relatively lower share of renewable energy in TES is on account of 
the reduction of biomass consumption in the sector. However, the move from inefficient biomassfired boilers to using appliances which are more efficient facilitates a much higher share of modern 
renewables, as shown in Figure 35.

roll-out of such technologies and ensure stakeholders are made fully aware of the benefits of these 
technologies. These measures should include training in the installation and manufacture of such 
technologies, technology transfer, and information campaigns demonstrating the gains to be made 
by using such technologies.

Potential for further use of Nigeria’s rich bioenergy potential
Nigeria is richly endowed with bioenergy resource potentials of many varieties that are yet to be fully 
harnessed. Biodegradable agricultural and municipal solid wastes hold great potential for meeting the 
growing energy needs of the country while having the dual benefit of reducing pollution by producing 
biogas using anaerobic digestion.

The agriculture sector represents a small share of energy demand (representing less than 0.5% 
of energy use in both the PES and the TES) but is a crucial part of the Nigerian economy with 
a very substantial share of the population employed in the sector at 35% in 2019 (World Bank, 
2021). However, increased mechanisation is expected to allow the sector to diversify. The TES sees 
final energy demand drop by 16.7% in 2030 and 2050 when compared with the planned case. 
Solar-based and electric pumpsets replace diesel/gasoline pumpsets, which substantially increases 
energy efficiency of the sector and allows it to achieve a renewable share of 70% by 2050 as shown 
in Figure 37. 
Nigeria has substantial volumes of waste that can be anaerobically digested to produce biogas that 
can be upgraded to biomethane for cleaner combustion. Figure 36 shows the distribution of organic 
crop production in Nigeria; waste products associated with this production could be used as a biogas 
feedstock. Post-harvest losses are problematic not only for perishable crops, but also for grain, 
livestock and fish production. It is estimated that following the harvest, around 25% of fruits, 40% of 
vegetables and 15-20% of the grain are lost (Okoro et al., 2020). This resultant energy produced from 
these wastes, if anaerobic digestion were developed at scale, could be used to replace significant 
amounts of natural gas usage directly without any significant changes in end use necessarily (such 
as in high-temperature heating applications) across the Nigerian energy system in the transportation, 
commercial, residential, industrial and agricultural sectors. 
The exploration of alternative energy sources such as anaerobic digestion will be important in 
diversifying the energy mix of Nigeria in the context of its increasing energy demand and economic 
expansion. This potential is expected to rise in the future due to increasing levels of waste generation, 
driven mainly by income growth, migration and urbanisation. This biogas could also be used to 
produce hydrogen in the reforming of biogas vapour, making it a potentially useful component of in 
the decarbonisation of difficult-to-decarbonise sectors.

Figure 37 Comparison of final energy demand in the agriculture sector in in the Planned and Transforming 
Energy Scenarios for 2015, 2030 and 2050Power sector
The TES, just as the name implies, sees a profound transformation of the total installed capacity mix 
with substantial penetration of renewable energy technologies. Here, the total installed capacity 
reaches 62  GW by 2030 and 178  GW by 2050. This equates to a 10% increase by 2030 and a
31% increase by 2050 in comparison with current and planned policies. From Figure 38, it is observed 
the share of fossil capacity drops substantially in this case to around 22.8% by 2030 and 8.4% by 
2050 on account of the massive penetration of renewable capacity, mainly solar, in the system. The 
overall aim of the TES framework is to promote the aggressive but realistic deployment of renewable 
energy beyond that seen in the PES. The TES sees an elimination of coal generation capacity, no new 
nuclear capacity additions and a substantially reduced expansion of natural gas generation capacity 
that is facilitated by maximising the use of Nigeria’s wealth in terms of domestic renewables.
In the TES, the share of renewables in the total capacity mix is 77% in 2030 and 92% in 2050. 
Just as in the PES, with the decentralisation of renewable energy systems in the country, off-grid 
PV systems with battery storage continue to account for a substantial share of the total installed 
capacity of renewables. Also, due to the more constrained operation of variable renewable energy 
(VRE) such as PV, the capacity needed to deliver the same amount of electricity is higher, leading 
to a considerably higher generation capacity in the TES. While the system operation will need to 
change to integrate such a high share of VRE, the substantial amount of off-grid batteries with PV 
would help ensure a reliable supply.

Bioenergy generation share 0% 8% 11%
Renewable generation share 9% 70% 84%
Battery capacity (GW) 1 21 75 
While the system operation will need
to change to integrate such a high 
share of VRE, the substantial amount 
of off-grid batteries with PV would help 
ensure a reliable supply.These changes in capacity have corresponding shifts in total electricity production, which reaches 
206 TWh in 2030 and 561 TWh in 2050 as illustrated in Figure 39. These values correspond to reduction 
of around 6% in 2030 and 1% in 2050 in comparison with the planned case. Despite the substantial 
growth in demand-side management as well as efficiency improvements, there is no substantive 
reduction in electricity demand, particularly by 2050. This is due to the higher electrification of end 
uses implemented in this scenario (e.g.  electric cookstoves and EVs) which, in turn, increases the 
electricity demand. Consequently, owing to the electrification of end uses in this scenario, the profound 
effect of efficiency improvements and demand-side management are not well-pronounced in terms of 
electricity production. The renewable share in power generation reaches 70% of total generation in this 
scenario by 2030 and 84% by 2050. Off-grid PV remains the dominant source of renewable electricity 
production in both 2030 and 2050. In addition, once off-grid capacity is excluded, the centralised share 
of VRE in the system reaches 13% by 2030 and 17% by 2050, which has been achieved in many regions 
of the world with operational practices for such integration being well-established.

Potential for further development of Nigeria’s rich offshore wind potential
There is significant wind potential in Nigeria which, if developed, could diversify the energy mix, 
improve energy security and lead to significant job creation. Although wind speeds are generally low 
in the country, in the southern part of the country, coastal locations such as Lagos, Rivers, Bayelsa, 
Ondo, and Akwa Ibom states have the potential to harness wind energy (Adedipe, Abolarin and 
Mamman, 2018). Due to the higher wind speed in these coastal areas, offshore wind farms here can 
produce significantly more power per turbine than onshore sites. Offshore wind speeds also tend to 
be steadier that those onshore, which can improve the consistency in the power output of these sites. 
In terms of employment, offshore wind has much potential for Nigeria; the development of a typical 
500 MW offshore wind farm requires around 2.1 million person-days of work. Manufacturing takes 
up 59% of the labour requirements of such a project, followed by operation and maintenance (24%) 
and installation and grid connection (11%). Factory workers account for more than half of the labour 
needed in manufacturing (IRENA, 2018b).
Additionally, given that Nigeria has a significant oil and gas sector, which has many natural synergies 
with offshore wind development, specifically in terms of skills and occupational patterns, it is important 
to consider in a national context. Offshore wind turbine foundations, array cables and substations are 
fundamentally the same as oil and gas platforms in terms of structure and layout, which would allow 
for a leveraging of existing national expertise in the development of these projects (IRENA, 2018b). 
Successful job migration between sectors, however, depends on dedicated retraining policies. Specific 
policy measures, such as upgrading and supplier development programmes, support for joint ventures, 
or industrial promotion schemes, may be needed to strengthen the industrial capacity of domestic firms. 
Another factor to consider in this regard is the recent volatility of oil markets, which featured negative 
oil prices in 2020 and near record highs in 2022, serving as a reminder of the volatility of markets 
for oil – and other fossil fuels – and of the geopolitics associated with the current energy system 
and its underlying revenue streams. Many oil companies have woken up to this challenge and are 
actively developing new lines of business activity. The findings of IRENA’s recent paper “International 
oil companies and the energy transition” suggest more needs be done to meet energy transition 
needs (Asmelash and Gorini, 2021). Such decisive shifts towards low-carbon energy, such as offshore 
wind, are vital to help fossil fuel-producing companies and countries find their place as the energy 
companies of the future.Carbon emissions
The TES profoundly affects CO2 emissions. Total CO2 emissions reach 115 Mt in 2030 and 189 Mt 
in 2050, representing savings of around 42.8% and 63.4% respectively compared with the PES as 
shown in Figure 40. Just as in the PES, the transport sector accounts for the largest source of CO2
emissions in the TES, accounting for around 60% of the total CO2
 emissions in 2030 and 65% in 2050. 
It may also be observed that there is a substantial drop (75.4%) in CO2
 emissions from the electricity 
sector on account of the aggressive deployment of renewable energy technologies, most notably 
solar PV, in the TES. Agriculture remains the lowest source of CO2
 emissions within the energy sector 
with a share of less than 0.5% across the two scenarios across the modelling time frame.
Investment needs
The TES shows itself to be a cost-effective scenario with less capital investment required than for the 
PES. The overall results point out that investments in energy-efficient technologies and renewables 
are cost-effective. The TES has lower investment costs than the PES, USD 1.22 trillion (2010) compared 
with USD 1.24 trillion (2010) between 2015 and 2050, while delivering the same energy service. 
It can be seen that the transport sector contributes the most to the investments in the economy-wide 
energy system in Figure 41 for the three milestone years presented, which consists of investments 
predominantly from private individuals. The transportation sector represents the largest portion of 
investment predominantly due to the cost of the vehicles required to meet an expanding demand 
for personal transport with higher incomes. Due to the aggregated nature of some sectors in the 
model, their investment needs may not have been adequately captured. It is also key to mention 
that these investment costs exclude the costs of negative externalities which would be incurred in 
the planned case such as those for premature mortality associated with air pollution and reduced 
modern energy access.

Figure 40 CO2 emissions of the Planned and Transforming Energy ScenariosFor the power sector, Figure 42 shows more clearly the annual investment for the power sector for 
the same three milestone years. For policy makers, this direct investment in the power sector is 
particularly important to consider given much of this investment will need to be borne by national 
bodies and will be key in delivering the TES across all end-use sectors.
The annual investments estimated here are based on technical feasibility and techno-economic 
modelling of the energy system, which rely on parameters which are inherently uncertain, and 
thus cannot fully reflect real-world factors such as complex political and social factors or 
financial leakage in the system that shape real-world investment requirements. As a result, the 
real investment requirements may be higher than those analysed here. Nevertheless, the TES can 
transform the energy system of Nigeria into one which is more cost-effective, cleaner and modern 
while accelerating national development.

Financing solutions for the future of energy in Nigeria
Achieving the TES will require a shifting of and scaling-up of investments in Nigeria in the short term 
to avoid locking in investment in fossil fuel infrastructure with long lifetimes. In the year 2050, in terms 
of primary energy requirement, the TES uses over 40% less natural gas and 65% less oil than the PES, 
which has a profound implication for infrastructure investment for these uses of resources. 
Safeguarding Nigeria’s future energy needs will be dependent on today’s choices to put the country 
on a trajectory to sustainable and cleaner energy solutions. The sheer scale of the renewable energy 
resources at Nigeria’s disposal and cost reductions in these technologies mean that for these 
technologies to play the role envisaged in the TES, financial solutions will need to be developed to 
meet these needs and redirected away from the highly fossil fuel-dependent PES.
A well-functioning and comprehensive financial planning framework is needed for successful scalingup of clean energy projects and solutions across the whole energy system of Nigeria, such as that 
which was presented by the World Economic Forum (World Economic Forum, 2021) after a range 
of consultations with several financiers and stakeholders. Frameworks such as this can help ensure 
targeted delivery of finance to clean energy solutions that are aligned with national needs and sectors 
that not only address climate change issues but also can be implemented in a manner which propels 
development. This framework will need to capture and tailor solutions to the local context of energy and 
digital technologies that will support the energy needs of Nigerians, spanning financing instruments, 
business models, fund disbursement, technical assistance, capacity building, sector-based targeting 
and risk mitigation strategies.
Although development finance will be key to enabling the successful application of such a framework, 
financial de-risking mechanisms (such as blended finance) are needed to enable investments beyond 
development finance. Risk mitigation tools can be a useful strategy for reducing a variety of perceived 
and real investment risks and, as a result, securing investments from both the private and public 
sector. Some financing mechanisms that helps with risk mitigation include government guarantees, 
partial risk/credit guarantees, liquidity guarantees and political risk insurance (IRENA and AfDB, 
2022). These mechanisms can help insure investments in both the public and commercial sectors, 
such as the EUR 800 million worth of guarantees granted by the European Commission under its 
External Investment Plan (Convergence News, 2018; IRENA and AfDB, 2022).4.3 Impact of different growth rates 
The differences between the Planned and Transforming Energy Scenarios become more pronounced 
when the impacts of various economic conditions are considered. Out to 2050, there is uncertainty 
as to how the economy will perform and how this could affect the scenarios in this study. This 
section explores the impacts of different growth rates to the central 7% average growth rate (where 
the PES and TES are referred to as PES7 and TES7), with additional pessimistic and optimistic 
average economic growth rates of 5% (where the PES and TES are referred to as PES5 and TES5) 
and 10% respectively (PES10 and TES10), considered out to 2050. It should be noted that these 
differences in demand projection are based on a linear regression without any other adjustments.6
Figure 43 displays the primary energy requirement out to 2050 and how this varies by growth 
scenario. The renewable energy share of primary energy is broadly consistent within each respective 
PES and TES, regardless of growth rate. Without the adoption of more efficient appliances, cooking 
methods, vehicles and electrification of end uses, the primary energy demand expands substantially, 
and this is compounded by increased economic growth rates. As show in Figure 43, by 2050 the 
PES10 is nearly 60% more energy demanding than the TES10, where energy efficiency allows for a 
lower energy demand to drive the same level of development for the Nigerian economy, substantially 
decoupling economic growth and energy demand. However, the primary energy requirement for 
each respective PES and TES scenario does increase with economic growth, but the TES allows this 
growth to be mitigated by at least 34% in all cases with respect to the planned case, reducing the 
footprint and costs of the energy system.
6
 The model relies on exogenously estimated energy service demands based on the GDP values agreed upon by IRENA and 
the ECN. The context of the analysis wasn’t based on implementing a CO2 constraint but on evaluating the energy system and 
emission impacts of energy efficiency, renewable energy and energy access polices.

Figure 43 Primary energy requirement across all scenarios considered
Note: TJ = terajoules.Figure 44 presents TFEC and how this varies between scenarios for both the PES and the TES. In 
terms of energy consumption, it is the industry sector that is impacted most by reduced economic 
activity, followed by transport and the commercial sector. Residential and agricultural energy use 
are only modestly impacted due to these energy uses being largely non-discretionary in nature. 
Depending on whether it is the PES or TES, this translates to differing reductions in energy 
demand due to the different underlying technology mixes servicing different levels of energy 
service demands in these different scenarios. This translates to varying reductions in different fuel 
uses depending on the referenced scenario (PES or TES). For example, in the PES there remain 
considerably higher levels of biomass use than the TES but in the PES5 this is half the level of the 
PES10 (about 2 000 PJ versus 4 000 PJ); the vast majority of this reduction is from the industrial 
sector. In the TES, electricity demand is the most affected by the growth rate; in the TES5 this is 
approximately 40% lower than in the TES10 (about 1 600 PJ versus 2 700 PJ).

Figure 44 Final energy consumption changes between different growth scenarios in 2050Figure 45 shows the penetration of different technologies by scenario for the power sector and 
how they change in each respective scenario. Hydropower and solar PV play prominent roles in 
the power sector of each PES and TES level regardless of economic growth rate and represent “no 
regret” investment options. Hydropower reaches between 13 GW and 15.5 GW by 2050 across all 
scenarios and solar PV reaches at least 38 GW in the lowest case in PES and between 90 GW and 
140 GW across the TES cases. The low variation in hydro capacity merely emphasises the benefits 
it holds for the power system, while solar PV’s greater variation between the PES and the TES 
emphasises its need for policy support in scaling roll-out. The solar PV’svariation in the TES (as 
seen in Figure 45) in particular displays the benefits of its modularity as a technology and the sheer 
resource Nigeria has in scaling it to meet demand growth. In the buildings sector, this is also true 
for a shift away from traditional biomass in cooking towards cleaner cooking technologies such as 
electric cooking stoves.

Figure 45 Power generation capacity change between different growth scenariosWhile the variation in energy consumption for each scenario and growth rate is quite substantial, 
as shown in Figure  44, the impact on emissions is even more so. Figure  46 presents how the 
CO2
 emissions are affected by the technology deployment of each scenario and economic growth. 
Every transformative scenario is far less emitting than any of the planned scenarios; each is at least 
60% lower than its corresponding planned case. This is a crucial conclusion to draw, particularly in 
light of targets of the Paris Agreement and Nigeria’s NDC and the policy choices that could help 
achieve its goals.
Figure 47 identifies the differing investment requirements for the PES and the TES for differing 
economic growth rates, in each case further proving the economic benefits of the TES. Regardless 
of the growth rate considered, the investment required to achieve this scenario is more costeffective than the planned case even without considering the positive externalities of pursing a 
cleaner energy future with higher levels of access to clean cooking and electricity and greater 
availability of public transport with all the positive impacts of social mobility which could in turn 
spur even greater economic development.

Figure 47 Total annual investment for each scenario consideredNote that the investment values presented in Figure 47 correspond to investments in each of the 
milestone years of the model (which ran in blocks of five years) so these values correspond to 
investments in the preceding five-year band. An average investment per year between 2015 and 
2030 in addition to between 2015 and 2050 is presented in Table 13. It shows that the average 
annual investment from 2015-50 is greater than 2015-30 due to the relatively higher additional 
energy investments needed post-2030.
Table 14 displays some of the key implications of economic growth on the TES levels. Most notable are 
the impacts on power capacity (especially solar PV) and solar thermal applications, particularly in 
industry. For power, this owes to the efficiency of electricity as an energy carrier. Nigeria’s vast 
solar resource see’s renewable power meeting a significant share of demand in the transport and 
commercial sectors which are substantially impacted by the growth rate considered. The same is 
also true for solar thermal, which scales easily to meet a higher or lower demand in industry to 
medium- and low-grade heat applications. The scaling of these technologies and others lead to 
differing investment needs among the three growth scenarios considered. This scaling is due to the 
higher or lower energy service d emands which are met through using these technologies, which 
are modular and cost-effective and consistently deployed across scenarios.

Key implications of growth rates
Power 
generation 
capacity needs
Electricity demand expands and contracts with higher and lower economic growth rates. 
There is 26% more generation capacity needed in TES10 (225 GW) compared with TES7
(178 GW), including 25 GW more solar PV. However, in TES5 this capacity need is 22% lower 
than under the 7% growth rate at 139 GW; again, much of this results from lower deployment 
of solar PV due to its low cost and modularity. 
Solar thermal 
in industry
Economic growth impacts industrial expansion leading to significantly higher deployment of 
solar thermal heating, reaching 900 PJ in the 10% growth rate scenario compared with 400 PJ 
in the 5% growth scenario and 700 PJ in the central 7% growth scenario 
Traditional 
biomass use
Use of traditional biomass is greatly affected by economic growth rate, especially
in the PES but also the TES with significant implications for the environment.
For the PES by 2050, PES7 sees 1 029 PJ biomass use while this drops to 655 PJ
in PES5 and rises to 1 317 PJ in PES10. 
Investment 
needs
The economic growth rates dramatically affect the investment needs, reaching 
USD 122 billion (2010) in the central 7% TES level, which rises to USD 149 billion in TES10 
and drops to USD 91 billion (2010) in the TES5 case.ACTIONS 05 NEEDED NOWNigeria is at a key point in time to capitalise on its abundant renewable energy resources to meet 
the growing needs of its population while simultaneously addressing socio-economic challenges. 
To do so requires a broad and comprehensive set of policies for all the sectors of its economy which 
will facilitate the transition away from fossil fuels with all the economic and health benefits that 
would follow. Renewable energy technologies will be key in achieving a sustainable energy mix
for Nigeria. 
Broad-based national planning will be required to plan and manage the energy transition so that 
the benefits outweigh the costs and are evenly distributed across the country. Accelerating the 
energy transition and maximising its benefits require an integrated energy planning approach that 
combines targets and commitments with holistic and long-term plans including the deployment 
of energy transition technologies, the phasing-down of fossil fuels (and their direct and indirect 
subsidies) and the thorough consideration of their socio-economic impacts. An integrated longterm plan should be developed in co-ordination among different ministries and national bodies. The 
energy plan must consider the different transition pathways including electrification, the deployment 
of green gases, sustainable biomass and solar thermal among key enabling infrastructure. The 
plan must be based on specific needs, macroeconomic conditions, availability of resources, the 
infrastructure already in place, and the level of development of different regions, accessibility and 
cost of technologies. Developing and implementing an integrated long-term plan requires strong 
co-ordination and a robust institutional structure. This is especially the case when it comes to 
electrification with renewables, as it calls for the synchronisation of the deployment of renewable 
power plants with measures to deploy electricity-powered technologies in in a timely fashion.
Among other measures, a fiscal system is needed that facilitates the adoption of energy transition 
solutions while disincentivising new investments in fossil fuel technologies and supporting a 
national phase-down and -out of these technologies aligned with a climate compatible pathway. 
Policies and measures are also needed to facilitate access to finance, foster innovation and raise 
awareness among consumers – and citizens in general – to support the uptake of transition-related 
technologies. Development of financing mechanisms for distributed renewables and technologies 
(microfinance, margin money finance, etc.) in addition to information campaigns will also be key to 
roll-out of a whole host of goals achieved in the Transforming Energy Scenario (TES) in terms of 
clean cooking, distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery installations.
Actions needed nowA long-term, integrated energy plan is also necessary to co-ordinate the deployment of renewablesbased solutions with measures to raise energy efficiency and develop the needed infrastructure, 
while minimising stranded assets. Based on the long-term energy plans, corresponding investments 
are needed to upgrade existing and develop new infrastructure, often as a prerequisite to attracting 
private investments in energy-transition-related solutions. Such an integrated energy plan can 
help minimise stranded assets for a given climate ambition by developing national strategies that 
leverage existing infrastructure and expertise.
This section highlights the key barriers identified throughout the Renewable Energy Roadmap 
(REmap) process and the corresponding actions to overcome them. The adoption of these 
recommended actions would contribute to the widespread use of renewable energy throughout 
Nigeria. In order to ensure the realisation of the huge renewable energy ambitions outlined in the 
TES, the proceeding policies and measures are recommended.
5.1 Power
• Improve the existing financing mechanisms and explore further regulatory options. Despite the 
demonstrated benefits of renewables, the adoption of renewable energy technologies in Nigeria 
is still growing at a slow pace compared with what is obtainable in other countries within the 
region, such as Egypt, Kenya and South Africa. Fostering innovative financing mechanisms for 
distributed renewables and utility-scale technologies such as blended finance and microfinance 
will help deliver higher penetrations. Especially in the substitution of diesel generators by standalone solar systems and mini-grids which have a higher upfront cost but significantly lower 
operation cost. The government’s existing policies/programmes in this regard are already on the 
right track but need to be actively implemented. Furthermore, the existing Renewable Purchase 
obligation (RPO) mechanisms need to be strengthened and made workable. Having clear and 
transparent RPO target formulation while setting standardised and transparent procedures to 
determine the targets and making such targets mandatory while ensuring strict enforcement are 
important elements towards promoting renewable energy technologies in the country.
• Improve and expand the regulatory framework for decentralised renewable energy solutions. 
Nigeria has been successful with a progressive regulatory regime for mini-grids (both off-grid and 
on-grid) backed by various dedicated financing schemes (such as the results-based financing facility 
and minimum subsidy tender). It is important that this framework architecture continue to evolve as 
technologies develop and new applications emerge with participation of both public and private sectors.
• Accelerate electrification of end uses and promote policies that would support it. The 
energy transition both globally and in Nigeria requires electrification, but it must happen in an 
orderly and well-managed fashion. Proactive policy making is necessary to avoid some initial 
pitfalls. Delaying action policies can lock in fossil fuel solutions and reduce opportunities for 
sector coupling. Ineffective policies can create additional barriers (e.g. transitional barriers or 
reputational barriers) that will reduce the attractiveness of electrified solutions and increase the 
challenges of achieving the energy system outlined in the TES.• Modernise the transmission and distribution infrastructure. The analysis shows that the Nigerian 
grid needs to be prepared for the integration of large-scale renewables. Efforts should be placed on 
strengthening the existing central grid and more efforts should be placed on developing interstate/
intercity regional transmission capacity for optimum utilisation of available power. The TES requires 
relatively higher deployment of renewable energy technologies into the existing system. Planning 
for integration of renewables into the grid is a key requirement for the success of renewable power. 
Investments are essential to support infrastructure and renewable energy development and should 
be accorded high priority. As Nigeria’s transmission system is not very mature, it presents an 
opportunity for the country to develop its power transmission system in a modern fashion. Moreover, 
a smart grid will go a long way to support the management of intermittent solar and wind. As 
Nigeria’s decentralised supply system grows, it becomes pertinent to integrate it into the central 
grid. In some cases, decentralised generators can produce surplus energy that can become wasted 
if not supplied to the central grid. Here, a smart grid system will help to accommodate this surplus 
and provide the needed compensation accordingly. Furthermore, electricity theft is a major issue in 
the Nigerian electricity sector. A smart grid system will help to curtail this issue. Additionally, greater 
use of distributed PV can reduce the need for transmission and provide valuable upstream benefit. 
• Invest in renewable over fossil energy. The analysis shows that it is cost-effective to invest 
in renewable energy technologies over fossil fuels such as coal, owing to the declining costs 
of renewables (all TES levels). The Nigerian Energy Masterplan and Vision 30-30-30 seek to 
integrate coal into the Nigerian electricity supply mix. However, there is currently no existing coal 
power plant in the country. While acknowledging that plans are under way for the deployment of 
coal-based technologies, the current scenario also presents an opportunity for Nigeria to develop 
its electricity system in a more sustainable manner by leapfrogging fossil-based technologies 
and focusing more on cost-effective renewables. Beyond environmental sustainability issues, 
Nigeria is still a developing country in dire need of financial resources to drive its developmental 
agenda. Thus, there is no room for wastage of resources on technologies that are not costeffective. It will be to Nigeria’s benefit in terms of environment and economics to abandon the 
current coal plans and invest more in renewable energy. Such targets and goals for renewables 
need to be translated into policies and measures. Quantified quotas for renewable power can be 
considered, along with a system for issuing and tracking energy attribute certificates. Structured 
procurement policies such as feed-in tariffs, premiums and auctions are instrumental to address 
context-specific barriers and risks and to serve specific objectives. 
• Develop a robust database for renewable energy potentials and a corresponding pipeline of 
bankable projects. Apart from solar and hydro, there is a considerable dearth of information 
regarding the potential of renewable resources in the country. There is a need for comprehensive 
assessment of wind energy potential in the country for both on- and offshore wind. As 
observed from the analysis, the potential for geothermal, wave and tidal energy is yet to be 
quantified and thus, no plans yet to develop these renewable energy resources in the country. 
It is recommended that the federal government perform a detailed assessment to have a 
robust database of Nigeria’s renewable energy potential. This will help to support planning for 
renewable energy development and also show the possible locations for renewables deployment.IRENAs Global Atlas for Renewable Energy is a free web-based platform that could help in 
addressing this; it provides users with data and tools to assess their renewable energy potential 
(IRENA, 2022a).
5.2 Buildings
• Improve upon existing efforts to promote clean cooking. Despite the decades of efforts to promote 
clean cooking in Nigeria, around 80% of Nigerians still do not have access to clean cooking facilities. 
This can be attributed to a lack of affordable alternatives which subdues the ability of households to 
transition to clean cookstoves. Although traditional biomass fuels (fuelwood, dung, crop residues, 
etc.) are freely available, the low efficiencies, environmental impacts and health implications 
associated with their use do not make them a sustainable option in the long-term. While the Nigerian 
government has developed various programmes to enhance clean cooking, it is recommended 
that future government initiatives ensure that programmes for improved cookstoves, which are 
aimed at expanding cooking options via modern renewables (modern biofuels and electricity) are 
introduced. This should take place within a clean cooking policy framework that makes it a clear 
priority in a cross-ministerial approach that tackles cost and finance barriers, bolsters sustainability 
and supply chains, and creates awareness about impacts and solutions. It is thus timely that the 
federal government has recently established a committee to develop a national policy on clean 
cooking and meeting universal access (Nigerian Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, 2022).
• Improve upon existing appliance efficiency and lighting programmes. The majority of electricity 
consumed in the residential and commercial sectors is through lighting, refrigeration, air conditioning 
and miscellaneous electrical appliances. For lighting, the replacement of incandescent light bulbs 
with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and other efficient lights can bring about large energy savings 
as observed in the TES for the residential/commercial sector. Towards this end, the cost of LED and 
other efficient lights needs to be reduced to make them more affordable by promoting their largescale manufacturing. In addition, bulk procurement and establishment of “buy back” schemes have 
worked elsewhere to implement the switch to compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and LED light 
bulbs. The analysis also shows that even with a conservative estimate of efficiency improvement 
possibilities, there exists substantial scope for savings in residential and commercial refrigeration 
and air conditioning. For this, it is necessary to make available efficient types as against locally 
made technologies, provide incentives to purchase from government-certified outlets and generate 
awareness among consumers. In this regard, the government needs to support the Standards 
Organisation of Nigeria with all the necessary funding required to maintain and enhance its appliances 
standard programmes. Enhanced capacity building across the industry and stakeholder groups in 
areas like consumer behaviour related to appliance use, manufacturers, and suppliers are required 
in continuing to meet minimum energy performance standards for appliances. Furthermore, there 
is a need to promote solar thermal for hot water application. Households, hospitals, hotels and 
schools use hot water for different purposes, especially for bathing. It is recommended that efforts 
already aimed at expanding the use of solar water heaters in the residential/commercial sectors be 
improved upon, which could be achieved through provision of financial incentives and customised 
loans to promote renewables for direct use.• Promote energy efficiency policies such as stricter building codes, support for building retrofits 
and appliance standards, which are critical conditions for the efficient uptake of renewable cooling 
in buildings and industrial processes. Such measures are mostly cost-efficient in the medium 
term and can improve the cost-competitiveness of renewable heating and cooling applications. 
The benefits of these policies can be compounded if combined with measures to encourage the 
uptake of digital monitoring and control technologies which enable smart building operation. 
5.3 Transport
• Faster adoption of biofuels. Nigeria has a biofuel policy in place, but it needs to be improved 
and implemented appropriately. The major setback to the implementation of alternative fuels 
in Nigeria’s transport sector is the lack of availability of the fuels which thereby reduces the 
choices available to Nigerian consumers. For example, in the case of private vehicles, where 
ethanol and biodiesel can be fuel choices, the lack of large-scale availability of the fuel reduces 
the fuel choices available to Nigerian consumers. Furthermore, Nigeria’s biofuel target as per the 
National Renewable Energy Action Plan is focused on using first-generation biofuels. To provide 
wider alternatives, it is recommended that efforts are improved to promote the adoption of 
second- and third-generation biofuels.
• Policies aimed at transport electrification and acceleration of the adoption of electric vehicles 
(EVs) should be put in place. In a country where only 64% of the population have access to 
electricity for basic services such as lighting, it becomes very difficult to have additional 
electricity to serve EVs. First, as a key priority, the electricity grid should to be strengthened to 
accommodate the impact wide adoption of EVs would have on the grid. Measures that can be 
applied are financial and fiscal incentives to increase uptake of EVs; bans on internal combustion 
vehicles; setting clear and ambitious national targets for electric cars, buses and trains; and 
mandating EV charging stations in new buildings. Furthermore decentralised charging stations 
powered by renewables (solar PV) and established at various locations in the country to cater for 
EV charging needs while also serving as a source of revenue for the business owners. Moreover, 
via the vehicle-to-grid option and vice versa, EVs could help to provide storage infrastructures 
needed for both TES5 and TES7 where renewable power is deployed aggressively. A key milestone 
to addressing this challenge will be the development of a dedicated EV policy that outlines the 
programmes and measures that will be used to improve EV diffusion in the country. • Enhancement of public transportation offerings and rail infrastructure driven by renewables will be 
key to achieving the modal shifts and energy efficiency needed in transportation. The analysis also 
shows that modal shift will play a key role in reducing transport energy demand as observed in the 
TES Railways currently account for less than 5% of land transport demand in Nigeria. While efforts are 
under way to revamp the sector, without any focused and aggressive actions such as the development 
and financing of an integrated national long-term multimode transportation plan, the share of railways 
will remain insubstantial in the future transport system. Efforts to improve the existing rail network 
would necessitate large infrastructure and upfront investment costs, but at the same time would have 
important implications on the long run, on both energy and emissions. The development of high-speed 
railways and dedicated freight corridors would lead to a major shift of both passenger and freight 
movement from road to rail. Being the most energy-efficient mode of transportation, its attractiveness 
would increase once it is technologically and operationally efficient, too, providing better services as 
compared with road. Modal shifts in freight and passenger transport go beyond railways, however, 
and encouraging switches to public transport, biking and walking will require infrastructure roll-out to 
match such ambition so that they are seen as a safe and reliable alternative to cars. 
5.3 Industry
• Develop local renewable energy technologies manufacturing industries. Despite the huge decline 
in the costs of renewable energy technologies globally, the cost of renewable energy technologies 
in Nigeria remains relatively high compared with global averages. Some of the key reasons for 
this are the costs of financing, the fact that most renewable energy technologies are imported 
into the country and a lack of an enabling environment for local renewable energy technologies 
manufacturing. A key recommendation here is to develop an enabling environment to support 
renewable energy technologies manufacturing industries in the country through expanding the 
local demand for renewable energy technologies. Effective measures to create such an enabling 
environment include industrial upgrading programmes, supplier development programmes, 
promotion of joint ventures, development of industrial clusters and investment promotion schemes. 
To ensure the full-fledged development of a nascent industry, policy support should be time-bound 
and include broader aspects beyond deployment, human resources and industrial development. 
Beyond cost matters, Nigeria has high levels of unemployment. Developing local renewable energy 
technologies manufacturing industries will help ameliorate the problem by creating employment 
opportunities such as solar panel production. These employment opportunities are significant; 
manufacturing the main components of a 50 megawatt solar PV plant requires 50225 person-days 
where the production of solar cells requires most work (almost half of the total) (IRENA, 2017).
• Focus on energy efficiency improvement in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
by providing financial/fiscal incentives to boost their capacities to adopt state-of-the-art 
technologies. Policies and measures need to be developed to support the electrification of 
industry including regulations to expose consumption to price signals (e.g. time-of-use tariffs); 
public support for research, development and demonstration in the direct and indirect use of 
electricity in industrial processes; the relocation and co-location of energy-intensive industry to 
sites with low-cost renewable electricity with high load factors; and incentives or requirements 
for the use of efficient cooling systems through mandates and financial incentives.• Promote the adoption of solar heating technologies in large industries where there are available 
spaces to deploy them. For SMEs, industrial clusters should be promoted by designating specific 
clusters across various regions and making them an integral component of regional economic 
development strategy, which would enable multiple SMEs to derive process heat from a few solar 
thermal installations. 
5.4 Agriculture
• The feasibility, sustainability and scalability of decentralised renewable energy solutions in the 
agri-food sector highly depend on appropriate institutional and policy frameworks. Clear and 
targeted measures are needed such as designing development plans tailored to local conditions, 
levelling the playing field for renewables solutions by addressing market distortions, and putting 
in place specifications and standards to ensure market differentiation between high- and lowquality products to support a strong market development and ensure users’ confidence in 
the technologies (IRENA, 2016). Such measures would support renewable energy markets by 
incentivising local enterprises, stimulating demand, thereby promoting productive uses.
• Improve the affordability of solar irrigation pumps. While solar irrigation pumps are already 
cheaper than diesel and gasoline pumpsets in terms of levelised cost of energy, their initial 
capital outlay remains relatively higher. This scenario makes it challenging for Nigerian farmers 
(predominantly poor and peasant farmers) to purchase solar pumpsets as they remain 
financially disadvantaged. To make solar pumpsets competitive, the Nigerian government needs 
to provide targeted subsidies and grants as well as robust financing mechanisms to make the 
capital requirement for solar irrigation pumps lower than their diesel and gasoline counterparts. 
Furthermore, due to the predominant use of diesel and gasoline pumps in the sector, some 
farmers have become accustomed to using these conventional technologies and thus may find it 
difficult to shift even when they have the resources to do so. This implies that there should be a 
focus on clear promotion of the benefits of solar-based irrigation pumps in addition to training in 
their installation and use. The government, as well as the government workers, need to promote 
awareness of solar irrigation pumps and their associated benefits, especially in the rural areas.
• Policies to promote the adoption of efficient pumpsets. Conventional irrigation pumps in 
Nigeria are mainly the inefficient types. To improve efficiency in this sector, regulatory measures 
are needed that will require farmers to use minimum energy pumpsets and prohibit inefficient 
pumpsets from being sold, as well as better technical support and capacity building for all 
stakeholders.
• Incentives to promote adoption of alternative fuel tractors. The Nigerian tractor subsector is 
dominated by diesel-powered tractors. To promote the use of biodiesel and electric tractors, the 
government needs to establish policies that will discourage the use of diesel-powered tractors. 
For example, the government may establish policies that provide additional agricultural inputs 
(seedlings, fertiliser, micro grants) for farmers who employ biodiesel and electric tractors for 
their farm traction needs.Adedipe, O., Abolarin, M.S. and Mamman, R.O. (2018), ‘A review of onshore and offshore wind

 Director P and PC The TIMES Nigeria model
The overall approach employed in this study was to use an integrated energy system model to 
analyse how Nigeria’s growing energy service demands can be supplied under various scenarios 
out to 2050.
This study largely relies upon energy system analysis using TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL EFOM 
System) modelling framework for Nigeria (Loulou, Remne, et al., 2005). The main output of TIMES 
are the energy system configurations to meet energy service demands, which are exogenous to 
the model and further detailed below. The model considers primary energy supply, final energy 
consumption, energy flows, greenhouse gas emissions, capacities of technologies and marginal 
emissions abatement costs. 
The TIMES Nigeria model employed for this exercise has been set up for 40 years extending from 
2015 to 2050 at five-year intervals and follows the same structure as was initially presented by 
Dioha and Kumar in (Michael O. Dioha and Kumar, 2020). In the model, the Nigerian energy system 
has been split into five major energy-consuming sectors: transport, industry, commercial, residential 
and agriculture. Each of these five sectors is further split into subsectors to reflect the sectoral enduse demands, as TIMES is a demand-driven model and thus shapes energy supply technology 
configurations to meet these demands. 
On the supply side of the energy system, the model considers the several available energy 
resources that are produced locally and those that are imported in order to satisfy the various enduse demands. The energy resources encompass conventional energy such as oil and natural gas as 
well as renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydro and biomass. Furthermore, the annual limit of 
extraction of each of these fuels is represented by constraints imposed on the supply side.
To capture inter-fuel and inter-technology substitutions within the model, the relative energy prices 
and technology costs (investment costs, operation and maintenance [O&M] costs) of various forms 
were defined. Furthermore, various technical parameters (e.g. technical efficiency, capacity factor, 
lead time, lifetime) of conversion and process technologies are incorporated in the model. Nigeriaspecific capital costs and O&M costs for various technologies included in the model database have 
been obtained from various sources. Wherever Nigeria-specific costs are not available, international 
costs are used. Moreover, future reduction in the cost of emerging technologies has also been 
assumed based on an understanding of the particular technology development. 
APPENDIX BCost assumptions
Table 15 shows the various economic costs considered for energy resources in the model. To reflect 
the price differentiation across several energy-consuming sectors/segments/uses, the study did 
not consider the implications of subsidies and taxes. The energy prices for the future are taken 
from various sources (both local and international). Fossil fuel prices were mainly adapted from 
projections from the United States Energy Information Administration. A discount rate of 12% has 
been applied to account for energy resources produced locally. It is worthwhile to state that there 
has been uncertainty in fossil fuel prices in recent years for several reasons. Thus, the projections 
here are subject to oil market volatility.
Given the wide range of technologies modelled in TIMES Nigeria, there was no central cost data 
source. Various websites, interviews, manufacturers’ quotations, stakeholders and calculations have 
been used to arrive at the cost of technologies and production of energy resources used in TIMES 
Nigeria model. However, care was taken to ensure that the cost data used reflect the true cost of 
the technologies in Nigeria. Table 16 shows the cost assumptions used for electricity generation 
technologies which were derived from ETSAP (2017), UCT Energy Research Centre (2019) and 
Yetano Roche (2017). For a more detailed breakdown of these costs for further end uses please 
consult the Appendix of Dioha and Kumar (2020) which has a ful model description.

On the demand side of TIMES Nigeria model, econometric models were developed based on various 
macroeconomic drivers that are used to understand the changing patterns of end-use demands. 
The socio-economic form of any country serves as the basis of its development trajectory and also 
plays a key role in determining its future energy demand trajectory and corresponding emissions. 
Population and gross domestic product (GDP) are the commonest forces influencing the patterns 
of growth, production and consumption choices in an economy. Moreover, socio-economic analysis 
is imperative to examine the associated costs and benefits of undertaking alternative choices and 
understanding the macroeconomic implications on the economy. Accordingly, this study examines 
how these drivers may influence final energy consumption in the Nigerian economy. 
Population and its structure
Population census in Nigeria is under the purview of the National Population Commission. The last 
census conducted in the country was in 2006. Then, Nigeria’s population was estimated at around 
140 million people. In this study, the future projections of Nigeria’s population are taken from the United 
Nations 2019 Medium Variant World Population Prospect. Accordingly, in 2015, the total population of 
Nigeria was estimated at around 181 million people. This value is expected to grow by over 100% to reach 
around 401 million people by 2050 (Table 17). In a similar time frame, the rate of urbanisation is expected 
to rise from 48% to about 70%. Data on characteristics of Nigerian households are usually collected by 
the National Bureau for Statistics (NBS) through its household living standard measurement surveys. 
The survey reports have been used in deciding the sizes for rural and urban households in Nigeria. The 
total number of households has been projected to increase from 16 million rural and 18 million urban in 
2015 to around 24 million rural and 70 million urban by 2050.

The GDP trajectories used in this study were requested at the Renewable Energy Roadmap (REmap) 
workshop held in Abuja in January 2020 with key stakeholders spanning the Nigerian energy sector 
and the Honourable Minister of Science and Technology to help enable a deeper understanding of 
scenarios developed. The central scenario used for this study is 7% per year average growth rate 
(a rate which was decided upon in consultation with stakeholders) with two additional growth 
rate scenarios also considered – a 5% per year average growth pessimistic case and 10% per year 
average growth optimistic case. The GDP projections are assumed to take effect from 2021 while 
the actual reported GDP values by the NBS and Central Bank of Nigeria have been used for the 
three growth scenarios for the period 2015-19 (NBS, 2020). The GDP of 2020 has been impacted by 
COVID-19 pandemic and this was reflected in the study with a negative GDP growth rate (-3.2%) as 
projected by the World Bank (World Bank, 2020). The GDP structure is assumed to be consistent 
across all the scenarios as presented in Table 18 below for the central growth scenario.

Table 18 7% GDP growth rate and sectoral distributionDiscount rate
The choice of a social discount factor plays a key role in determining the robustness of energy scenarios 
arising from a social perspective within the context of a technology-rich cost-optimisation model 
(García-Gusano et al., 2016). The discount factor is applied in the case of public-sector investment 
projects. In the case of no uncertainty, the projects can be ranked on the basis of net present values. 
The project with the highest net present value is chosen in such a case. A high social discount factor 
would prioritise projects with immediate net benefits whereas a low factor will indicate to prioritise 
projects with long-term net benefits (Murty and Goldar, 2006). Given that Nigeria is a developing 
country, lacking in major infrastructure investment, there is a strong case for using a higher discount 
factor. Consequently, a discount factor of 10% (inflation-adjusted) has been used for this study.
Energy service demands
To estimate the energy service demands across various demand sectors, econometric techniques 
such as regressions, process models and end-use methods were employed. The population and GDP 
projections were used as the main driving force for estimating the end-use demands in each of the 
energy-consuming sectors. The energy use on the demand side is disaggregated into five sectors 
namely i) residential; ii) transport; iii) industry; iv) commercial; and v) agriculture. Each demand 
sector has different end-use energy demand and technologies meeting these, as described below.
Residential sector
The residential sector consumes energy for cooking, lighting, air conditioning, refrigeration and hot 
water and for operating other miscellaneous electrical appliances. The energy sources consumed 
by the Nigerian residential sector mainly include traditional biomass (firewood, crop residue and 
animal dung), electricity, kerosene and LPG (Dioha, 2018). Traditional solid biomass fuels are mainly 
used for cooking in rural areas of the country. However, with the current efforts to improve clean 
cooking access in the country, these fuels are gradually being replaced with modern cooking 
fuels such as LPG and modern biofuels. Thus, commercial energy use in the residential sector is 
also increasing on account of the change towards more energy-intensive lifestyles as well as the 
transition to commercial energy forms as urbanisation grows.

appliances such as fans, computers, televisions, phones, washing machines, etc. Population growth 
and the dynamics of demographic shifts across rural and urban classes of households have a direct 
influence on energy demands in the future and are captured appropriately. Demand for the various 
energy services were computed separately for rural and urban households based on diffusion rates 
of these appliances across the two classes of household and the estimated appliance usage norms.
Transport sector
In the transportation sector, the demand is disaggregated into mode-wise passenger-kilometre 
demand and freight-kilometre demand and using various econometric demand estimation models 
based on several socio-economic variables, such as per capita GDP, total GDP (constant price) and 
population. For passenger-kilometre demand, the study considered demand for motorcycle, private 
car, taxi, light bus, coach, passenger train, boat and aeroplane. For freight-kilometre demand, this 
study considered demand for truck and freight train. To project the future passenger- and freightkilometres demand from each mode, their respective projected vehicle population numbers is 
multiplied with the average occupancy rates and the dynamic utilisation rates.
Industry sector
Demand for the industry sector was estimated for four energy-consuming subsectors, namely 
cement, fertiliser, steel and paper. The other energy-consuming industries include the small-scale 
industries, such as beverages, foundry, ceramics, leather etc., and are classified in one subsector 
collectively named “other industries”. The production output of each industrial subsector was used 
as a proxy for demand and projected into the future using econometric techniques. We used linear 
regression techniques for future projections for each of the major industry subsectors, taking 
production as the dependent variable and other macroeconomic variables (total GDP and sectoral 
GDPs) as the regressor. Due to a wide range of products within the “other industries”, in place of 
projection of physical production, the projection for final energy demand has been used.
Commercial sector
The commercial sector comprises various institutional and industrial establishments such as 
restaurants, banks, hotels, shopping malls, public departments supplying basic utilities etc. The 
majority of the energy use in the commercial sector is mainly associated with services such as 
cooling, lighting and cooking. In the commercial sector, energy service demand is projected based 
on the total floor area of the commercial sector and using the value added by the services sector as 
an explanatory variable. Energy demand for providing civic services such as street lighting, public 
waterworks and sewage systems are internalised in the analysis.Agriculture sector
Traditionally, Nigeria has been an agricultural economy. Agriculture is still a major source of 
employment, although its share in GDP was around 22% in 2019. In the agriculture sector, final 
energy demand is estimated for irrigation pumping, traction and kerosene applications. The 
demand for irrigation pumping is calculated by estimating the irrigation pump demand of the 
agriculture sector. Demand for traction is calculated by estimating the number of tractors that 
will be required in future. Kerosene application demand was estimated based on the historical 
growth of kerosene in the sector. Crop production was used as the main driver of energy service 
demands in the sector.
POWER
Coal
PES
Nigeria’s proven reserve of coal is about 639 million tonnes (Mt) while the inferred reserve is about 
2.75 billion tonnes. The coal-fuelled electricity generation target in Nigeria’s Vision 30-30-30 is to 
achieve generation capacity of 0.424 gigawatts (GW) by 2020 and 3.2 GW by 2030. Currently, there 
is no coal plant in Nigeria; however, there are plans under way to use the domestic coal resources 
in Enugu and Kogi states for power generation in the country. Permission has been granted for the 
development of at least one coal power plant. It proposed to use the less innovative technology 
(subcritical technology) and does not include carbon capture and sequestration. In view of the 
interest in coal as per the Vision 30-30-30 as well as stakeholders’ review, it is assumed that 0.4 GW 
of coal-powered generation would be available by 2030 and 10 GW by 2050.
TES
The TES envisages a Nigerian energy system without coal power plants. Since construction is 
yet to start, the scenario suggests that there is no need to invest in coal power generation to 
avoid carbon lock-in as Nigeria moves towards a more sustainable energy mix in the future. 
Accordingly, the TES assumed that coal would not be deployed in the Nigerian energy system.
Gas
PES
The gas-fuelled available on-grid generation capacity target in Vision 30-30-30 is 13 GW. In 
2015, Nigeria had about 10.6 GW of total installed gas capacity. However, less than 5 GW 
is available for grid electricity owing to inadequate gas supply. Nigeria's proven natural gas 
reserves is around 202 trillion standard cubic feet, representing a huge opportunity for domestic 
gas utilisation. In this scenario, the maximum total installed capacity of natural gas power plants 
is assumed as 18 GW by 2030 and 38 GW by 2050. This modest projection is based on the 
current interest of the government towards decentralising electricity generation in the country. 
Thus, limiting investment in conventional centralised power plants.
TES
While Nigeria pushes for more utilisation of domestic natural gas for electricity generation, the 
TES suggests that Nigeria has other domestic renewable resources to invest in beyond natural 
gas. Thus, investment in natural gas is slowed after 2030 which therefore leads to a capacity of 
around 14 GW by 2030 and 15 GW by 2050. Further, capacity utilisation of existing power plants 
is increased up to 85%.
Nuclear
PES
Exploration of uranium– the main source of nuclear energy in the country – is still in progress 
and the proven reserve is yet to be quantified (ECN, 2014c). Government agencies and 
independent researchers have tried to quantify uranium reserves in Nigeria. At the end 
of various exploration programmes in 2001, the reserve of uranium in Nigeria was put at 
around 200 tonnes, with grades ranging from 0.63-0-9% at a vertical depth of 130-200 metres 
(Karniliyus and Egieya, 2014). Currently, there is no nuclear power plant in Nigeria. However, 
there are plans under way for establishing one. While the Nigerian Electricity Vision 30-30-
30 envisaged the development of a nuclear power plant by around 2025, it has been assumed 
that only after 2030 can a nuclear power plant be deployed in Nigeria. The scenario assumes 
a maximum of 1 GW by 2030 and 5 GW by 2050. Stakeholders’ opinions with respect to 
uncertainties and delays in land acquisitions, public acceptance, international diplomacy, slow 
development and commercialisation of nuclear technologies forms the backbone for such 
modest projections.POWER
Nuclear
TES
The TES also envisages an atom-free energy system in Nigeria. Since nuclear power is yet to 
be developed, the scenario suggests that there is no need to invest in expensive nuclear power 
technologies where there are other relatively cheaper renewables to employ towards the same 
purpose of power generation. Accordingly, the TES assumes that nuclear would not be deployed 
in the Nigerian energy system.
Hydro
PES
Nigeria has a large hydro potential of around 24 GW. However, this potential is yet to be exploited. 
In 2015, Nigeria had about 1.9 GW installed capacity of large hydro. There are projects under way 
such as the Lokoja – 0.75 GW, Makurdi – 1 GW, Zungeru – 0.7 GW plant in Niger state and the 3.05 
GW Mambilla hydropower plant in Taraba state which are aimed at complementing the existing 
large hydro systems. The large hydro electricity generation target in the National Renewable 
Energy Action Plan (NREAP) is to more than double the existing capacity up to 4.7 GW by 2030. 
In view of the government plans to rehabilitate and expand the capacities of the existing hydro 
plants, the capacity of large hydro plants is assumed to reach 5 GW by 2030 and 10 GW by 2050. 
It is assumed that the 3.05 GW Mambilla hydroelectric project will come on board before 2030 and 
further expansion of large hydro projects will continue even after 2030.
Nigeria potential for small hydro is around 3.5 GW. However, the existing small hydro capacity is 
just around 0.068 GW. The NREAP target for small hydro is 1.2 GW by 2030. With the renewed 
interest in small hydro plants as per the NREAP, it is assumed that the NREAP target will be 
realised and the capacity of small hydro increases to 1.2 GW in 2030 and up to 3.0 GW by 2050. 
TES
The overall purpose of the TES framework is to promote the aggressive deployment of 
renewable energy beyond the PES. Thus, it is assumed that the technical potential of large and 
small hydro is realised faster compared with the PES case. Accordingly, large hydro capacity 
reaches 7 GW in 2030, 12 GW by 2040 and remains constant to 2050. Similarly, small hydro 
capacity reaches 2.2 GW in 2030, 3.5 in 2035 and remains constant to 2050.
Solar
PES
The annual average total solar radiation varies from around 25.2 megajoules per square metre 
(MJ/m2
) per day in the northern region to around 12.6 MJ/m2/day in the southern region (Emodi 
and Yusuf, 2015). Nigeria has a theoretical potential for electricity production from solar PV 
technology in the range of 207 000 gigawatt hours r annum if only 1% of the land area were used 
for solar PV installation (NESP, 2015). 
Centralised grid-connected solar PV
Currently, Nigeria has no grid-connected solar PV plant. However, there are serious plans under 
way to connect solar PV plants to the central grid. Several solar projects have received licences 
to be grid-connected such as the 100 megawatt (MW) facility in Bauchi state and many others 
in different states of the country. The target of the NREAP is to achieve grid-connected solar PV 
of 2 GW by 2020 and 5 GW by 2030. The target of 2020 is yet to be achieved. Adapted from the 
NREAP and modified by stakeholders’ opinions, it is assumed that efforts in this regard will be 
improved and grid-connected solar PV capacity will be 5 GW in 2030 and reach 25 GW by 2050.
Decentralised solar PV
There exist off-grid solar PV systems scattered across the country in the forms of solar water 
pumping systems, solar home systems, solar street lights and mini-grids. There is no reliable 
estimate of the totalled installed capacity of decentralised systems in the country. However, 
2015 estimates show that there is around 0.01 GW of decentralised systems (Roche et al., 2019). 
Development of decentralised renewables is assumed to progress in line with government 
policies and programmes. As per the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets, 13 GW 
of decentralised solar PV is assumed to be met by 2030 while 30 GW is to be met by 2050. 
CSP
Deployment of CSP requires areas with huge direct normal irradiation (DNI) potential. High DNI is 
experienced in the northern region and it varies from 6.0 kilowatt hours per square metre ( kWh/m2
) 
per day (2 190 kWh/m2
/year) to about 7.5 kWh/m2/day (2 737.5 kWh/m2/year), stretching from 
Adamawa to Sokoto (Ogunmodimu and Okoroigwe, 2018). The NREAP target is to achieve 0.05 GW 
of CSP by 2020 and 1 GW by 2030. Presently, there is no CSP plant in Nigeria. Based on the current 
plans and stakeholders’ review, CSP capacity is modelled as 1 GW in 2030 and 5 GW in 2050.Solar
TES
Given the abundant solar radiation and land available in the country, additional solar capacities 
are not considered as a challenge, provided the financial resources needed for the same are 
available. 
Centralised grid-connected solar PV
Maximum capacity is assumed that grid-connected solar PV capacity will be 10 GW in 2030 and 
reach 40 GW by 2050. To account for the huge growth in demand in TES10, the capacity was 
further expanded to 60 GW by 2050.
Decentralised solar PV
Maximum capacity of 22 GW of decentralised solar PV is assumed to be met by 2030 and 75 
GW by 2050. To account for the huge growth in demand in TES10, the capacity was further 
expanded to 80 GW by 2050.
CSP
CSP is assumed to penetrate up to a maximum of 2 GW by 2020 and 12 GW by 2050. To account 
for the huge growth in demand in TES10, the capacity was further expanded to 16 GW by 2050.
Wind
PES
The wind energy potential in Nigeria is very modest, with annual average speeds of about 
2 metres per second (m/s) at the coastal region and 4 m/s at heights of 10 metres in the far 
northern region of the country. Based on wind energy resource mapping carried out by the 
Ministry of Science and Technology, wind speeds of up to 5 m/s were recorded in the most 
suitable locations, which reveals only a moderate and local potential for wind energy. The 
highest wind speeds can be expected in the Sokoto region, the Jos Plateau, Gembu and Kano/
Funtua. From the study, Maiduguri, Lagos and Enugu also indicated fair wind speeds, sufficient 
for energy generation by wind farms. Apart from these sites, other promising regions with 
usable wind potential are located on the Nigeria western shoreline (Lagos region) and partly 
on the Mambila Plateau. Thus, Nigeria is located in the poor-to-moderate wind regime. Wind 
energy deployment in Nigeria should be focused in the northern region. Apart from the coastal 
and offshore locations, the wind speed in southern Nigeria is relatively low, while higher wind 
speeds are experienced in the northern region (Emodi and Yusuf, 2015). Currently, there is no 
estimate of offshore wind potential in Nigeria. However, the Federal Ministry of Power says that 
it is conducting an offshore wind mapping. For this study, it is assumed that only onshore wind 
turbines will be deployed in Nigeria. The target of the NREAP is to achieve 0.17 GW of gridconnected wind capacity by 2020 and 0.8 GW by 2030. Currently, there is no grid-connected 
wind plant in Nigeria. However, there are wind projects under development for grid connection 
such as the 10 MW facility in Katsina and the 100 MW in Plateau state. Owing to the poor wind 
regime in the country as well as stakeholders' opinion, wind-based capacity is pegged at 0.8 GW 
in 2030 and will reach a maximum capacity of 7 GW by 2050. 
TES
Wind-based capacity is pegged at maximum of 2.5 GW in 2030 and will reach a capacity of 10 GW 
by 2050, assuming they will be installed in the windy northern parts of Nigeria. To account for the 
huge growth in demand in TES10, the capacity was further expanded up to 14 GW by 2050.
Biomass
PES
Exploiting the huge potential of biomass resources in the country, especially in the form of 
agricultural residues for power generation, will go a long way to resolve the current energy 
crisis in Nigeria (Simonyan and Fasina, 2013). While there exist many biomass options for power 
generation, this study considers only agricultural residues as feedstock for biomass power plants 
(ECN, 2015b). The annual potential of agricultural residues is estimated at around 145.62 Mt 
(Simonyan and Fasina, 2013). To date, there has not been any significant plan to establish a 
biomass power plant in the country. The NREAP target is to achieve around 0.3 GW capacity 
of biomass electricity by 2020 and 1.1 GW by 2030. In this study, maximum biomass-based 
generation (using agricultural residue as fuel) is modelled as 1 GW by 2030 and 4 GW by 2050.
TES
Maximum biomass-based generation (using agricultural residue as fuel) will be 3 GW by 2030 
and 11 GW by 2050. To account for the huge growth in demand in TES10, the capacity was 
further expanded up to 24 GW by 2050.POWER

(tidal/ wave/ geothermal)
PES Potentials yet to be quantified and no policy/target yet. 
INDUSTRY
PES
The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) target for high-energy-consuming sectors (e.g. industrial 
sectors) is that efficient energy will increase by at least 50% compared with baseline. However, the NEEAP 
does not provide baseline values and it does not have specific targets for key appliances/process in the various 
subsectors of industry. Hence, in the PES framework, efficiency improvement is considered as per the historical 
trend and in line with the conventional technological options in the Nigerian manufacturing sector. 
The efficiencies of industrial processes are assumed to improve autonomously and stably by 1% annually 
over the modelling time frame. Owing to the continuous liberalisation of the Nigerian market, it is assumed 
that large-scale industries such as cement and fertiliser industries will improve their energy efficiency levels 
by adopting state-of-the-art and advanced technologies. In the cement sector, the use of wet process is 
minimised and phased out by 2050 and the use of dry processes with 4-6 stage preheater + precalciner is 
expanded to account for 100% of cement production processes by 2050. Generally, it is assumed as per the 
NEEAP that the specific energy consumption (SEC) of these large-scale industrial subsectors will improve 
but it has been implemented in the model by the adoption of new and advanced technologies (which have 
better SEC) over the modelling time frame.
The “other industries” which mainly consists of SMEs is assumed not to adopt energy-efficient technologies 
at a faster pace owing to their limited financial capacities. Most of them belong to the category of the 
unorganised informal industrial sector. Moreover, their fragmented nature and lack of technical know-how 
remains a barrier to their swift adoption of energy-efficient technologies.
However, in TIMES Nigeria model, the “other industries” subsector is parameterised using dummy 
technologies owing to the dearth of data. Hence, the plethora of industrial products in the sector is not 
captured and the cost of improving energy efficiency is not well-represented. It is assumed that the 
SEC (efficiency of the dummy techs) will improve autonomously by 1% annually. Note that due to the 
aggregated nature of the subsector by using dummy technologies, the adoption of new and advanced 
technologies is impossible.
TES
It is assumed that a large number of new, more efficient and advanced technologies are introduced in 
the industry sector, thus retiring the older ones. Solar-based industrial process heat is set to replace 
some of the conventional fossil- and biomass-fired systems in the large-scale industries (up to 50% by 
2050). Due to space-constraint in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the penetration of solar 
process heat was limited.
SEC of the large-scale industries and the energy intensities of the SMEs is assumed to improve by 30% 
by 2030 and 100% by 2050, beyond the autonomous improvements in efficiencies assumed in the PES.
TRANSPORT
PES
Nigeria’s transport sector is dominated (around 98%) by fossil gasoline and diesel. The National 
Biofuel Policy (NNPC, 2007) and the NREAP push for the expansion of biofuels usage in the transport 
sector. Using first-generation biofuel, the target of the NREAP is to achieve 57.34% ethanol as share 
of gasoline consumption by 2030 and 17.45% biodiesel as share of diesel and fuel oil consumption by 
2030. In the model, this has been implemented by varying share of vehicles running on different fuel 
types but based on stakeholders’ consultation. The NDC and Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) 
actions envisage the use of domestic gas resources for automobiles. On 1 December 2020, the Nigerian 
government launched its National Gas Expansion Programme, which is aimed at the distribution of 
auto-gas across gas stations to promote the wider use of gas in vehicles (ENERGY VOICE, 2020). TRANSPORT
PES
Generally, the PES assumes a modest increase in the shares of compressed natural gas (CNG) and 
biofuels dependent vehicles. Owing to the current biofuel policy, it is assumed that the penetration 
of biofuels vehicles will be favoured more in comparison with electric vehicles (EVs). Thus, a slight 
penetration of EVs is considered. Similarly, it is worth mentioning that autonomous improvements 
(0.2% annual improvements) in fuel economy are considered across the modelling time frame. The 
following presents the numerical assumptions used in the model. Note that the shares here refer to the 
shares in the total vehicle fleets and not the shares of new buys. As earlier noted, gasoline and diesel 
dominate the current system (98%), so we won’t be discussing them further – the focus will be on the 
key alternative vehicle fuel type implemented in each scenario.
Boat: Boats are 100% run by diesel. The share of biodiesel-powered boats increases from 0% in 2015 to 
2% in 2030 and 10% in 2050.
Truck: Trucks are run 90% by diesel and 10% by gasoline. The share of biodiesel trucks increases from 
0% in 2015 to reach at least 3% in 2030 and 8% in 2050. The share of CNG/LPG-powered trucks reaches 
5% in 2030 and 12% in 2050.
Rail: Currently, the existing few networks of the Nigeria rail transport system are based on fossil diesel. 
Consequently, a lag has been applied to account for the time required to develop infrastructures 
needed to accommodate electric-powered trains. The share of electric trains in passenger and freight 
rail movement increases from 0% in 2015 to 2% in 2030 and 20% in 2050.
Light bus: Light bus is run 98% by gasoline and 2% by diesel. The share of CNG/LPG light buses 
increases from 0% in 2015 to reach a maximum of 10% in 2030 and 30% in 2050. Also, penetration of 
biofuel-powered light buses (at least 1% by 2030; 12% by 2050) and electric light buses (0.2% by 2030; 
8% by 2050) are accounted for. 
Coach: Coaches are run 50% by diesel and 50% by gasoline. The share of CNG/LPG coaches increases 
from 0% in 2015 to reach a maximum of 10% in 2030 and 30% in 2050. Also, penetration of biofuelpowered coaches (at least 1% by 2030; 12% by 2050) and electric coaches (0.2% by 2030; 8% by 2050) 
are accounted for.
Motorcycle: Motorcycles run almost 100% by gasoline. The share of electric motorcycles increases
from 0.01% in 2015 to account for 2% by 2030 and 10% by 2050. 
Private car: Private cars run 98% by gasoline. The share of CNG/LPG private cars increases from 0.001% 
in 2015 to reach 10% in 2030 and 30% in 2050. Also, penetration of biofuel-powered private cars
(at least 1% by 2030; 12% by 2050) and electric private (0.2% by 2030;
10% by 2050) are accounted for. 
Taxi: Taxis run 98% by gasoline. The share of CNG/LPG taxis increases from 0.001% in 2015 to reach 10% 
in 2030 and 30% in 2050. Also, penetration of biofuel-powered taxis (at least 1% by 2030; 12% by 2050) 
and electric private (0.2% by 2030; 10% by 2050) are accounted for. 
This scenario does not favour the penetration of EVs in Nigeria’s transport system due to the lack of a 
dedicated EV policy in the country.
TES
The transport sector in this scenario has been modelled in a way such that gasoline- and diesel-run 
vehicles are increasingly replaced by biofuels, electricity and CNG-powered vehicles.
Boat: The share of biodiesel-powered boats reaches 10% in 2030 and 30% in 2050. Similarly, the share 
of electric boats reaches 10% in 2030 and 30% in 2050. 
Truck: The share of biodiesel powered truck reaches at least 20% in 2030 and remains constant to 2050; 
electric trucks reach 10% in 2030 and 30% in 2050; CNG/LPG-based trucks reach 14% in 2030 and 30% in 2050.
Rail: The share of electric-based traction in passenger and freight rail movement rises to 12% in 2030 
and 40% in 2050. 
Light bus: The share of electric light buses reaches 11% by 2030 and 35% by 2050. Biofuel-powered 
light buses account for 20% in similar time frames.
Coach: The share of electric coaches reaches 10% by 2030 and 35% by 2050. Biofuel-powered coaches 
account for 20% in the same time frames. TRANSPORT
TES
Motorcycle: Electric motorcycles are encouraged and their share is assumed to rise to 20% by 2030 and 
50% by 2050. 
Private car: The share of electric private cars reaches 10% by 2030 and 35% by 2050. Biofuel-powered 
private cars account for 20% in 2030 and 25% in 2050. 
Taxi: The share of electric taxis reaches 10% by 2030 and 35% by 2050. Biofuel-powered taxis account 
for 20% in 2030 and 25% in 2050. 
Modal shift is also considered as a demand-side management strategy. By 2050, 40% of freight will be 
on rail; 20% of private car demand shifts to public transport as well as non motorised means and 40% of 
interstate passenger road movement goes to rail.
Along with the penetration of these alternative fuels/technologies in the sector, we have also assumed 
improvements in the fuel economy of vehicles (additional 0.2% annual improvements) beyond the 
autonomous improvements considered in the PES.
RESIDENTIAL
PES
In the residential sector, several factors have been considered towards the assumptions made on the 
level of energy access and penetration of efficient and advanced appliances. 100% access to electricity 
is achieved by 2030 in urban areas but achieved by 2035 in rural areas. Clean cooking systems include 
LPG, modern biofuel stoves, improved wood and electric stoves. In the analysis, 100% access to clean 
cooking devices is not achieved in both rural and urban areas. 
Rural cooking: In 2015 the shares of cookstoves in rural areas are as follows: LPG stove (3.5%), 
kerosene stove (20%) and fuelwood and other stoves (76.5%). The share of LPG stoves for rural areas are 
modelled as 20% in 2030 and 50% in 2050; improved wood stoves as 16% (2030) and 31% (2050); electric 
stoves as 3% (2030) and 5% (2050). Other technologies – kerosene, modern biofuels, traditional threestone and solar cookstoves – account for the remaining percentages. 
Urban cooking: In 2015 the shares of cookstoves in urban areas are as follows: LPG stove (8.4%), 
kerosene stove (59.2%) and fuelwood and other stoves (32.4%). The share of LPG cookstoves for urban 
areas are modelled as 30% in 2030 and 70% in 2050; improved wood stove as 10% (2030) and 5% (2050); 
electric stove as 7% (2030) and 15% (2050). Other technologies – kerosene, modern biofuels, traditional 
three-stone and solar cookstoves – account for the remaining percentages. 
The NREAP target for number of residential houses with solar thermal systems is 7% by 2030. However, 
as at 2020, the share of residential houses fitted with solar water heaters is less than 1%. It is assumed 
that 3% of households will be fitted with solar water heaters by 2030 and 10% by 2050.
In 2015, it was assumed that 20% of the existing stock of refrigerators and air conditioners are the 
efficient types. The share of efficient refrigerators and air conditioners are assumed to rise in both 
the rural and urban households to about 40% in 2030 and 70% in 2050. It is also assumed that 100% 
electrification is realised after 2035 (in rural areas) and the use of kerosene lantern for lighting stops. 
It is assumed that efficient lighting technologies such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and lightemitting diodes (LEDs) penetrates into the rural households at a faster rate while incandescent bulbs 
are phased out completely by 2030.
TES
100% energy access is achieved in both rural and urban areas with a portfolio of clean cooking 
technologies by 2030. While LPG stove is the preferred choice for cooking in the TES, cooking 
technologies have been diversified. It is worthwhile to mention that biofuels (biogas) are more easily 
adopted by rural households due to the availability of resource compared with urban households. 
On the contrary, the penetration of electric stoves is assumed to be more pronounced in urban areas 
compared with rural areas. 
Rural cooking: The share of modern biofuels (gas and liquid) cookstoves for rural areas is 10% in 2030 
and 20% 2050. Improved wood stove: 22% (2030) and 31% (2050). Electric stoves account for 10% (2030) 
and 30% (2050). Other technologies – kerosene, LPG, traditional three-stone and solar cookstoves – 
account for the remaining percentage. RESIDENTIAL
TES
Urban cooking: The share of maodern biofuels (gas and liquid) cookstoves for urban areas in 5% in 
2030 and 20% in 2050. Improved wood stove: 12% (2030) and 10% (2050). Electric stoves account for 
15% (2030) and 40% (2050). Other technologies – LPG, kerosene and solar cookstoves – account for the 
remaining percentage. 
It is assumed that 5% of households will be fitted with solar water heaters by 2030 and 20% by 2050. 
The share of efficient refrigerators and air conditioners is assumed to rise in both rural and urban 
households up to 50% by 2030 and to 100% by 2050. About 50% of the lighting requirement is satisfied 
by CFLs and LEDs in 2030 and 100% in 2050. Energy intensity (i.e. efficiency of “1” used to parametrise 
the dummy technologies) of other miscellaneous electrical appliance is assumed to improve by 40% in 
2030 and 100% in 2050.
COMMERCIAL
PES
The energy service demands of the commercial sector are split into demand for lighting, air 
conditioning, cooking and other electrical appliances. The NEEAP and NREAP push for energy 
efficiency improvements and the use of renewable energy in the service sector. Here, analysis has been 
done based on improvements in energy efficiency via the adoption of more efficient and advanced 
technologies. Similarly, analysis for renewable energy has been done based on the use of renewables 
for satisfying various energy service demands.
The share of efficient/advanced air conditioners is assumed to rise from 25% in 2015 to 55% in 2030 and 
80% in 2050. 
For lighting, it is assumed that LEDs account for 30% of lighting in 2030 and 50% in 2050. 
The share of LPG stoves for cooking increases from 10% in 2015 to reach 20% in 2030 and 35% in 2050; 
improved woodstoves from 10% in 2015 to 20% in 2030 and 35% in 2050; electric stoves from 1% in 2015 
to 5% in 2030 and 10% in 2050.
For other electrical appliances, an annual reduction of 0.5% in technological efficiency is assumed.
TES
The share of efficient/advanced air conditioners is assumed to rise to 60% in 2030 and 100% in 2050. 
LEDs account for 40% of lighting in 2030 and 60% in 2050. 
The share of electric stoves for cooking reaches 10% (2030) and 25% (2050); modern biofuel stoves 10% 
(2030) and 20% (2050); improved woodstove 20% (2030) and 35% (2050). 
For other electrical appliances, an annual reduction of 1% in technological efficiency is assumed.
AGRICULTURE
PES
Energy in the agriculture sector is primarily needed for irrigation and land preparation.
In 2015, the share of gasoline irrigation pumps was 55%, diesel was 45% and grid-based irrigation pumps 
was 5%. The share of solar-based pumps is very marginal. It is assumed that the share of solar-based 
irrigation pumpsets reaches 5% by 2030 and 10% by 2050. The share of advanced electric grid-powered 
pump sets in irrigation is assumed to gradually increase to 8% by 2030 and 25% by 2050. These pumps 
are modelled to be twice as efficient than the diesel and gasoline pumps currently in use.
The share of biofuels-powered tractor increases from 0% in 2015 to 5% by 2030 and 15% by 2050. 
Furthermore, the share of efficient diesel-based tractors in the sector is assumed to gradually improve. 
TES
The share of solar-based irrigation pumps reaches 15% by 2030 and 50% by 2050. The share of advanced 
electric grid-powered pumpsets in irrigation is assumed to increase to 13% by 2030 and 30% by 2050.
The share of biofuels-powered tractors reaches 20% by 2030 and 40% by 2050. The share of electric 
tractors reaches 5% by 2030 and 20% by 2050.wwwirenaorg
