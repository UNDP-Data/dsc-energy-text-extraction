NNSP Implementation Framework 27 FOREWORD
The Government of Niue is committed to building a “Prosperous Niue” – Niue ke Monuina for 
all who wish to make Niue their home and enjoy the Tāoga and lifestyle which we have all 
come to realise is a life worth living to enjoy.
Creating wealth using the resources that God has bestowed upon our country, through 
investments in tourism, fisheries and selected crops noni and vanilla as well as our food 
security subsistence crops, have been identified as the cornerstone of our economic 
aspirations.
Generating greater revenue capacity through the introduction of a consumption based tax will 
lead to greater sustainability and financial stability. Working together in a coordinated and 
well planned manner to ensure the populations good health, well educated children and a 
strong and growing private sector supported by a robust and well managed public service is 
paramount. 
Government alone cannot make this vision happen. The vision must be built on a genuine 
shared desire to help develop Niue. Our forefathers overcame many hardships and 
challenges and we look back with pride at the foundations they built and recognise that it is 
our duty as caretakers to maintain our strong national identity; our “Tāoga” with responsible, 
smart logical strategies and solutions for our people. 
The central purpose of the Niue National Strategic Plan (NNSP) is to focus and invest on 
creating opportunities for everyone on Niue through Financial Stability, Good Governance, 
Economic, Environment, Social and Tāoga development pillars with economic growth as the 
identified anchor and vital for prosperity. 
In order for NNSP to work a whole of Niue approach will be needed to spearhead economic 
development initiatives identified and agreed in a consultation process which includes 
everyone and will continue to include everyone.
Niue is our Tāoga, our birthright. For those who choose to make Niue your home you are 
blessed with a country that is safe, unspoilt, and unbelievably beautiful. A country that holds 
a lifestyle and environment that is uniquely Niuean and very much sought after internationally. 
Take care of Niue, our country and Tāoga is irreplaceable and priceless.

Wellington, New ZealandVISION
Niue ke Monuina – A Prosperous Niue
The objective is to build a sustainable future that meets our economic and social needs while 
preserving environmental integrity, social stability, and the Niue culture. 
VISION STATEMENT
Niue’s journey towards prosperity commenced in 2003, under the National Integrated 
Strategic Plan 2003 - 2008. The achievements for this period were mixed. A category 5 
cyclone2that caused widespread damage 6 months after the Plan started, diverted financial 
and other resources to recovery and rebuilding post-cyclone. The strategic objectives have 
been adapted and strengthened for the 2009-2013 period. 
The achievement of Niue ke Monuina is supported by six national development goals or 
Pillars and specific strategies under each of those Pillars. Progress of the journey to 
prosperity is measured by targets and indicators corresponding to each of the Pillars. 
A number of strategies have been identified to achieve the Pillars. Careful and strategic 
allocation of resources will be prioritised so that the strategic initiatives, activities and targets 
can be achieved by 2013. 
The 2009 - 2013 Plan is a five-year strategic framework towards achieving ‘Niue ke Monuina’.
It provides the directions that we as a nation shall follow to enable us to achieve prosperity for 
everyone.
LIVING THE VISION
Niue will continue to be a sovereign nation in free association with New Zealand. Its unique
culture, based on spiritualism, language, heritage and social values, will thrive and be 
celebrated. Her people will continue to enjoy a high standard of living with a unique island 
lifestyle and a stable and responsible government.
Niue will continue to be recognised internationally for its unspoilt and unique environment, 
particularly its pristine coastal waters. It will continue to protect that environment through 
sustainable environmental practices. 
While government will continue to be the major employer, there will also be a vibrant private 
sector offering employment and investment opportunities to both locals and those wishing to 
make Niue their home. 
The tourism industry will continue to flourish based on the attractions that the unique 
environment has to offer. The industry will be serviced by regular airline services to New 
Zealand and other Pacific Island Countries. Vanilla and noni production and a thriving fishing 
industry are major contributors to the economy.
The revenue base for the government will have expanded so that there are sufficient funds 
available to finance necessary infrastructure maintenance and replacement, provide seed 
capital to encourage private industry and investment as well as continue to provide essential 
government services. Government will continue to be debt free.
As a result of these initiatives Niue’s population will be stable and possibly show a net 
increase. Government will continue to enjoy cordial international relations particularly with 
New Zealand, Australia her Pacific neighbours and valued investment partners. It will also 
continue to enjoy and participate in regional and international fora. The journey towards 
prosperity will continue to build the foundation for the future of Niue. NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PILLARS

GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The following guiding principles are fundamental to the achievement of ‘Niue ke Monuina’.
The principles apply to all systems and policies regarding the Plan in terms of strategic 
planning and implementation:
 Relevant to Niue ke Monuina – A Prosperous Niue
 Efficient and effective systems 
 Collaboration, communication and consultation with sector wide approaches
 Accountability, responsibility and transparency
 Sustainable healthy development
 Effective resource allocation and use
 A strategic focus and alliances with key stakeholders
 Cohesive and coordinated implementation of the strategic objectives
 Outcome focused, and mindful of cultural and spiritual values
 Constant monitoring and evaluation
 Implementation framework and outcome-based sector plans (outcome focused and 1 - FINANCIAL STABILITY
ENSURE THAT SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE SECURED, AND 
RESPONSIBLE FISCAL MANAGEMENT IS PRUDENT, SUSTAINABLE AND SUPPORTS 
HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES
AIM:
To have sufficient funds available on an ongoing basis in order to fund:
1) recurrent budget 
2) asset maintenance and replacement programmes
3) capital programmes, and
4) new initiatives in support of the strategic objectives
5) capital investment
Financial stability is fundamental for Niue to develop into a prosperous nation. Niue must 
ensure that sufficient financial resources are available in order to continue to meet its 
obligation for the nation. There will be challenges along the way; however with prudent fiscal 
management financial stability can be achieved if a whole of Niue approach is adopted. 
Niue’s financial resources are derived from taxation (income tax and import duties), 
government trading activities, sovereign assets and development partners. These resources 
are used to fund the Government’s annual recurrent costs which include personnel, asset 
maintenance and replacement, and economic development initiatives. 
In the last five years significant efforts have been made to ensure that all government 
services and functions are maintained. Niue is heavily dependent on its constitution partner
New Zealand for financial assistance. While New Zealand has a statutory obligation to 
provide the necessary economic and administrative assistance to Niue, Niue will look to foster 
diplomatic relationships and strategic alliances with the wider international community and 
within Niue’s Constitutional parameters with New Zealand. 
The introduction of a broad based tax system (Niue Consumption Tax), improvement on 
entrepreneurial activities and returns, the removal of government subsidies on certain 
services and user pay charges are some of the options that Niue is considering in order to 
address its ongoing cash flow challenges. 
The establishment of an Aid Management Unit, a fiscal management framework and a Public 
Sector Investment Programme will ensure better management of financial and technical
resources. These vital instruments will be used to highlight the areas where external funding 
will be essential to minimise pressure on the recurrent budget. 
STRATEGIES
Macroeconomic 
Management (Donor and 
External Funding, Fiscal 
Policy)
1. Target existing development partners funds to areas of 
high priority
2. Secure new development partners
3. Maximise benefits from existing external sources
4. Generate new sources of external funds
5. Review fiscal and taxation policy with a view to 
obtaining additional revenue
Entrepreneurial Activity Maximise returns from all trading and entrepreneurial activities.
Trust Fund and Sovereign 
Assets
Increase capital value of the Trust Fund 
Maximise returns from sovereign assets such as the Exclusive 
Economic Zone, philatelic and numismatic sector, upper air 
space, and other resources.2- GOVERNANCE
ENSURE THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE REFLECTS THE PRINCIPLES OF 
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND IS PRACTISED AT ALL LEVELS
AIM
To establish and practice good governance principles that will create an environment where 
all residents are fully informed and consulted.
Good governance promotes stability, peace and harmony, stimulates confidence across all 
sectors, Good governance keeps people informed and accountable and Niue remains 
committed to strengthen all aspects of good governance. 
Niue is part of the realm of New Zealand and a special relationship exists between the two 
countries. Under the Niue Constitution Act 1974 Niue will be seeking clarification and letters 
of exchange on a number of issues and grey areas.
Work on the public sector reform has commenced. This reform will facilitate a more efficient 
and accountable public service, with a structure that is more appropriate to the current
environment.
Law and order remains important for Niue. In an environment of increasing global challenges 
Niue’s justice system will need to be strengthened. The land court and processes will be 
more simplified and strengthened to function effectively, to facilitate land registration and 
titling process as access to land for developmental purposes is fundamental. 
Strengthening current statistical systems and dissemination mechanisms will be undertaken
to support national, regional and international commitments. Credible statistical data is 
important for evidence based decision for all stakeholders. 
As a nation with a small population, the demands on the limited resources available are very 
high. Thus, better coordination and appropriate usage of all public and development partner 
funds is paramount for the delivery of all services.

MAXIMISE BENEFITS FROM NIUE’S RESOURCES IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER 
FOCUSING ON PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT, TARGETING TOURISM, 
AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES SUPPORTED BY SAFE, RELIABLE, AFFORDABLE
HEALTHY INFRASTRUCTURE
AIM
To promote economic development by:
1) Supporting and targeting assistance to the private sector’s strategic plan with 
maximum potential
2) maximising use of Niue’s resources in particular tourism, fishing, noni and vanilla in a 
sustainable manner
3) encouraging foreign direct investment and trade, and
4) developing and maintaining key infrastructure.
A strategic approach is being undertaken to ensure that efforts are focused on key areas 
where Niue holds a comparative and competitive advantage, such as tourism, fisheries and 
agriculture. 
Visitor numbers to the island have increased with the commencement of the Air New Zealand 
service in 2005, flying direct from Auckland (New Zealand) to Niue, on a weekly basis. 
Potential for a second service is dependent on an increase in tourist accommodation and 
products. 
An increase in visitors will impact on infrastructure, and the Niue Waste Management Plan 
and National Water Management Plan will ensure that any negative environmental impacts
are minimised. Key infrastructure such as power, communication, water and sanitation, port 
facilities and roads will be upgraded sustainably. 
A review of the customary land system may identify ways to facilitate improved access and 
security of tenure to land for development purposes, while protecting customary ownership. 
There will be improved access to finance, and adopting appropriate foreign investment 
policies to encourage foreign investment, and skills and technology transfer, particularly from 
Niueans living abroad. Legislative and administrative requirements for the private sector will 
be streamlined and mechanisms to encourage investment will be explored, such as Insurance
and a Credit Rating system.
STRATEGIES
Private Sector 1) Promote, assist and support a vibrant private sector.
2) Form and foster partnerships with non-government 
organisations
Tourism Increase tourism in a responsible and sustainable manner 
taking advantage of our clean, green environment and cultural 
and social values.
Fisheries Increase the returns from the fisheries resource in a sustainable 
and responsible manner.

internet services; radio and television services. Air New Zealand flies direct from Auckland, 
New Zealand weekly on a Boeing 737 aircraft. Niue is serviced by monthly shipping services 
from Auckland, New Zealand.
Power is generated using diesel and the aim is for Niue to be 100% carbon neutral within the 
next three years. Niue is exploring renewable energy options to reduce reliance on fossil 
fuels and is considering energy efficient products such as electric cars and solar powered 
street lights.
STRATEGIES

ENJOY A HARMONIOUS AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE IN A THRIVING, EDUCATED AND 
SAFE COMMUNITY THAT HAS ACCESS TO A WIDE RANGE OF QUALITY SOCIAL 
SERVICES AND HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES
AIM
To provide social services of a quality that will maintain and enhance the quality of life on the 
island.
A population strategy and policy will be developed to maintain and build Niue’s population. 
Inward migration policies will continue to focus on Niueans living abroad.
Niue’s education system follows the New Zealand curriculum and provides free and 
compulsory primary and secondary education. Opportunities for tertiary education are 
available through the Government Reverse Scholarship Scheme or development partner
funded scholarships. 
An assessment on available human resources will assist planning for training opportunities in
areas where there are skill shortages. 
Niue has a new hospital with equipment that requires technical expertise. Public promotion on 
healthy living will target non-communicable diseases that are a high area of concern. Equally 
important is the provision of quality care for Niue’s elderly population, as well as the 
prevention of communicable diseases. Cost recovery options such as medical insurance to 
assist with overseas medical referrals, will be explored as well as assistance for referred 
patients.
The church and village communities continue to have important roles in society. The 
Community Affairs Department will continue to support church, youth, women, and sports 
groups that that promote community development. 
Sports activities will continue to contribute towards a healthy lifestyle and promote Niue 
through participation at regional and international levels. Niue competes in regional and 
international sporting competitions with rugby, touch rugby, weight-lifting and body building
being the most popular. Sports development policies will be strengthened so that top athletes 
can receive high-level coaching and training opportunities. 
STRATEGIES

Sports and Recreation Create an environment for people to enjoy sports and 
recreation, and to be competitive at a regional and international 
level5 – ENVIRONMENT
SUSTAINABLE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF NIUE’S NATURAL RESOURCES AND 
ENVIRONMENT FOR PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS
AIM
Utilise the abundant natural resources in a way that not only maximises the economic benefit 
but also ensures that future generations will be able to enjoy them to the full.
The need for sustainable use and management of the environment and natural resources 
begins at the village level. All residents of Niue are responsible for the management and 
sustainable use of the environment. 
Niue is susceptible to environment changes and a category 5 cyclone that devastated the 
island in 2004 demonstrated Niue’s vulnerability. 
The Department of Environment in collaboration with other departments will continue to 
ensure that the resources are managed effectively and that any adverse effects resulting from 
climate change are mitigated. Niue is an active participant in a number of international and 
regional discussions on climate change and environmental concerns and will continue to meet 
its reporting requirements. 
Environmental impact assessments will be compulsory for all development programmes. A
national waste management plan will be implemented along with resource management plans 
(such as fisheries and forestry). These plans will be implemented over the next five years 
and financial and technical resources will be required from development partners and 
international organisations. 
The management and protection of the water lens and water bores is fundamental given 
Niue’s vulnerability. Awareness programmes will educate the residents of Niue on 
sustainable use and management of the environment. 
STRATEGIES
Agriculture Ensure the sustainable use and management of the land and 
soil
Fisheries Enhanced management and conservation of the marine 
resources
Environment Sustainable use and management of the environment
Climate Change and 
Natural Disasters
The mitigation of adverse effects of climate change and natural 
and non natural disasters

Biodiversity Conservation The conservation of marine, freshwater and terrestrial 
biodiversity and ecosystems
Education for 
Environment and 
Sustainable Development
Increase public awareness of environment and sustainable 
development principles6 – TĀOGA NIUE
PROMOTE, PRESERVE AND STRENGTHEN NIUEAN CULTURAL HERITAGE, 
LANGUAGE, VALUES AND IDENTITY
AIM
To develop, sustain and enhance the sovereign and ethnic identity of the people of Niue 
through their own distinctive language, customs and traditions, arts and craft, history and the 
environment.
Tāoga Niue is the culmination of all elements that symbolise the “tagata” Niue; its identity, 
language, culture and heritage. Recognising the importance of Tāoga Niue for the well being 
of the “tagata” Niue and the need to preserve its culture and heritage, this sector has now 
been included as the sixth development pillar. 
The Department of Tāoga Niue established in August 2006 is the key agency responsible for 
the promotion, preservation and the overall coordination of all aspects that represents Tāoga 
Niue, with key sectors such as Education and Environment providing the necessary support 
and complementing programmes. Fundamental to the strengthening of the functions and 
operations of Tāoga Niue will be the enactment of the Tāoga Niue Bill and the Vagahau Niue 
Language Commission Bill in 2009. 
The Huanaki Cultural Centre was destroyed by Cylone Heta in 2004 and a new premise for 
Niue’s artefacts has yet to be constructed. Efforts will be expended to secure funding for the 
construction of the Kaina. Concurrent to these efforts will be the continuing restoration of 
historical public records damaged during Cyclone Heta, and strengthening of Niue’s public 
record keeping. 
Particular emphasis will be placed on the implementation of the Tāoga Niue Strategic Plan 
and the outcomes of the 2004 Tāoga Niue Fono. The preservation and the promotion of
Vagahau Niue, the arts, customs and traditions and history will be strengthened with the 
support of key stakeholders that reflects the ownership of Tāoga Niue, namely the family, 
village and national as well as government sectors such as Tourism, Education and 
Environment, and facilitated by the Tāoga Niue Department. 
The cultural bridge programme with the Niueans living abroad and those living in Niue will 
continue to feature and will complement efforts in other sectors to rebuild Niue’s population
and to further Niue’s aspiration towards economic prosperity. 
STRATEGIES
Kaina Tāoga Niue Preservation and repatriation of cultural artefacts and national 
archives through the construction of a multipurpose 
multifunctional facility to house and include all needs of Tāoga

DepartmentNNSP IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK
NNSP MONITORING AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK
The current NNSP 2009-2013 strategies contain some measurable and quantifiable targets 
and indicators, which will be used to determine achievements. At the same time it is 
acknowledged that these are susceptible to robustness and will require further scrutiny and 
testing due to lack of baseline data for support. Capacity building in this area is essential.
A key challenge in the previous Niue National Integrated Strategic Plan 2003 – 2008 was the 
overall coordination and management where the responsible agency responsible for
coordinating and managing the implementation and monitoring of the NNSP had not 
succeeded due to capacity constraints and other competing work programmes. 
Sector Master Plans
The NNSP outlines the broad sector strategies aimed at achieving the national development 
pillars. In these broad sector strategies, reference is made to the need to develop more 
detailed sector plans linked to the NNSP 2009-2013. Some sector plans are being reviewed 
to be adapted to the NNSP. 
Implementing departments will need to prepare sector master plans as indicated in the NNSP. 
The NNSP provides direction to ensure alignment and consistency with national development 
pillars.
Departmental Corporate Plans
Government departments or agencies will develop their respective Corporate Plans in 
accordance with the pillars and priorities set by the NNSP. The national budget process will 
be aligned to these plans and each department or agency shall prepare shorter term threeyear corporate plans linked to the sector master plans and the NNSP.
National Budget
Annual national budgets with multi-year budget frameworks will be based on the medium term 
fiscal policy management framework and linked to the NNSP and plans; being sector and 
corporate plans.
Public Sector Investment Programme
The Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) will provide for current and proposed 
allocation of capital and aid funding requirements of the NNSP and consequent sector master 
plans. 
It will outline the various programme initiatives and project activities linked to the NNSP
ranked by key development priorities.
The PSIP will form the core of project planning, programming and aid coordination, and is 
linked with the annual budgets and the multi-year budget framework and medium term fiscal 
policy management framework. 
The PSIP will be prepared in collaboration with all departments and agencies. The PSIP has 
a medium to longer term planning horizon (5 to 10 years) and can be updated annually. Its 
purpose is to:
 provide a clear and broad overview and guidance of national development priorities 
and projects for development partnership consultations, which are linked with the 
national development goals and strategies in the NNSP
 provide a clear overview and guidance of current and planned present and future
