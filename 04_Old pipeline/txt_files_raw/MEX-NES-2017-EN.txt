• National Energy Strategy development
• Methodology
• Expected outputs and indicators• It is an integral planning document that organizes and aligns the actions of
the different actors involved in the sector in the same long-term vision.
• It was originated from the 2008 Energy Reform and must be updated on
an annual basis.
• The document focuses on long-term strategic issues, i.e. the long term
actions and projects that need to be undertaken to improve the overall
conditions of the energy sector.
• The development of the strategy and its implementation will be the result of
a consensual approach involving an active participation of the country’s
legislative bodies, as well as scientific, academic and business
What is the NES?  • Establishes a vision to renew the energy sector,
which has been lagging behind expectations and
building bottle necks.
• Provides certainty to actors in the energy sector
for the medium and long term.
• Strengthens the GDP and through economic
development, it improves the living conditions of the
population, particularly those with lowest resources.
• Incorporates the consensus about the
inefficiencies that for years have been considered
must be corrected.
• Succinctly exposes the strategic problems from
which it establishes specific lines of action required
to achieve changes.
• From its methodology, it is possible to monitor its
Through its strategic objectives the
NES defines its essential purpose:
.. that the energy sector will serve
as a lever for development of the
country and, at the same time,
incorporate all Mexicans to the
benefits derived from access and
consumption of energy.Composed of:

• National Energy Strategy development
• Methodology
• Expected outputs and indicatorsFor the development of the NES 2013-2027, the following elements were
identified: two strategic objectives, three integration elements and four policy
measures. From their analysis, lines of action and strategic indicators were
defined, always in close adherence to the current legal framework

Analysis NES• Objective 1.- GDP growth
• Objective 2.- Social inclusion
1. Efficiency
3. Sustainability
2. Safety
1. Transport, storage and distribution
Objectives Policy
2. Refining, processing and generation
3. Oil production
4. Energy transition1.Hydrocarbon production can not be less
than the previous year.
2.Having 1P reserves of at least 10 years
(assuming 100% replacement of annual
production);
3.Hydrocarbon production should be
sufficient to cover the aggregate demand
trend of oil products and natural gas for
three years after the base year.
4.Natural gas should have the necessary
import infrastructure to meet the
domestic demand.
5.Fuel supply to regions that do not have
access
Even when the actors are free, are necessary the following premises:
Hydrocarbons
1.Expansion of the power sector through
projects that achieve the target set in the
LAERFTE and increase system security.
2.Incorporate a methodology that
recognizes energy security risks
associated with high fuel dependence
3.Electricity coverage must keep pace with
population growth.
4.Transmission lines should accommodate
interregional electricity trade.
5.Localized energy sources should be
integrated. (Distributed Generation)
