THE REPUBLIC OF
BELARUS
Renewables Readiness AssessmentThe Republic of Belarus recognises the key role that modern, energyefficient and carbon-neutral technologies play in the successful economic 
development of countries. Along with the international community, Belarus is 
continuously modernising and introducing innovations in the country's energy 
sector, including measures to develop renewable energy and replace fossil 
fuels with renewable sources. This work is aimed at creating favourable living 
conditions for the citizens of Belarus, increasing the competitiveness of the 
national economy and reducing negative environmental impacts, as well as 
fulfilling domestic and international obligations and goals.
The Republic of Belarus, as a member State of the International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA), requested that IRENA conduct a Renewables Readiness 
Assessment. This study, prepared in co-operation with the State Committee for 
Standardization and representatives of government agencies and organisations, 
presents the key aspects of the current state of the energy sector. It proposes 
significant short and medium-term measures to improve the legislative and crosssectoral environment to increase the development of renewables.
This comprehensive assessment is based on the results of working 
consultations with relevant stakeholders from government authorities and 
other organisations leading the renewable energy sector in Belarus, which 
helped to identify opportunities and develop solutions for increasing the 
use of renewables. The assessment also describes the factors hindering the 
development of renewable energy and measures to accelerate the pace of 
development of renewables in our country.
The implementation of the Renewables Readiness Assessment for Belarus 
will certainly help to enhance the positive image of the Republic of Belarus 
in the international community. It will form the basis for the development 
of new areas of co-operation with other countries and international and 
financial organisations in the field of renewable energy. The presentation 
and publication of the Renewables Readiness Assessment will also open 
up new opportunities for the Republic of Belarus to co-operate with 
international partners on the implementation of regional and cross-border 
projects of international technical assistance, investment, and infrastructure 
projects contributing to the achievement of national and global sustainable 
development goals, including Goal 7, “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, 
sustainable and modern energy for all”.
On behalf of the State Committee for Standardization of the Republic of 
Belarus, I express my gratitude to the International Renewable Energy 
Agency for the preparation of the Renewables Readiness Assessment for 
Belarus. I also express my gratitude to all international and national experts, 
government officials and stakeholders who contributed to this process and 
shared their best practices, knowledge and experience. The proposals and 
recommendations collected in the assessment will definitely have a positive 
effect and a direct impact on the implementation of a long-term energy

As the world moves towards a low-carbon future, the energy sector is 
undergoing deep transformations to rise to this challenge. Through renewable 
energy, a less carbon-intensive development model is now within reach, with 
numerous positive spillovers for the economy and society. 
Currently, fossil fuels make up more than 90% of the energy mix in Belarus, 
with natural gas taking the lion’s share. Power generation is also predominantly 
fossil fuel-based, with very limited integration of renewable sources. Energy 
imports amount to 84.8% of the total primary energy supply and come 
primarily from a single source supplier, exposing the country to price volatility 
and putting its energy security at risk. 
Renewable energy is the response to many of these challenges. Clean, reliable, 
available locally and increasingly cheaper, renewable energy would strengthen 
the energy security of Belarus by reducing its reliance on fossil fuel imports. 
It would contribute to economic growth, job creation and improved air 
quality, thereby enhancing the peoples’ well-being. Although still in a nascent 
stage in the Belarusian energy sector, renewable energy has been growing 
steadily over the past decade, accounting for 7.1% of the country’s final energy 
consumption in 2019. While most of Belarus's renewable energy production 
comes from biofuels, there is significant potential for biomass, solar and wind 
development and integration across all end use sectors. Setting ambitious 
renewable energy targets, designing renewable energy auctions, adopting a 
grid code to support the integration of renewables, de-risking investments, 
and enhancing human and institutional capacities are among the key actions 
identified by IRENA that could harness the potential of renewable energy 
sources in Belarus. 
Since 2011, nearly 40 countries in regions from Latin America and the 
Caribbean to Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific have undertaken 
Renewables Readiness Assessment, exchanging knowledge and fostering 
international co-operation to accelerate the deployment of renewables. Each 
process has been country-led, with IRENA providing technical expertise 
and highlighting regional and global insights, along with facilitating national 
stakeholder consultations. 
IRENA thanks the State Committee for Standardization of the Republic 
of Belarus (Gosstandart) for its close co-operation and engagement in the 
development of this RRA. The report has also benefitted from the valuable 
input of numerous other government agencies and national stakeholders.
I am confident that the observations and recommendations presented here 
will be valuable in addressing the challenges of the energy sector in Belarus 
by highlighting the path to uptake the deployment of renewables.

USSR Union of Soviet Socialist RepublicsThe Republic of Belarus is a landlocked country in eastern Europe with a population of 
approximately 9.5 million people. After the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics (USSR) in 1991, the economy of Belarus contracted, but it soon resumed 
growth due to an increase in labour productivity, favourable trading terms – mainly with 
the Russian Federation and the European Union (EU) – and further development of the 
manufacturing industry and exports. 
The Belarusian economy is highly energy intensive, and the country’s energy sector is 
overwhelmingly fossil-fuelled and import-dependent. The country’s total primary energy 
supply (TPES) in 2019 was composed of 62% natural gas and 28% oil, with the remainder 
comprising mainly biomass, waste, coal and peat. Energy imports are mainly from the 
Russian Federation, and amount to about 85% of all energy supplied in the country. The 
largest fuel import dependency is on natural gas, of which only 2% supplied is produced 
domestically. This makes Belarus one of the world’s most energy import-dependent 
countries and dramatically compromises the country’s energy security. 
Renewable energy is at an early stage of development in the Belarusian energy sector. 
The share of renewables, although steadily increasing over the past decade, stood 
at just 7.1% of the TPES in 2019. This share comprises largely biofuels and, to a lesser 
extent, solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind. Nonetheless, the country is well endowed with 
renewable energy resource potential that presents a viable and sustainable pathway for 
the development of the energy sector. Biomass is the most abundant renewable energy 
resource, but there is also significant wind and solar PV potential in almost all areas 
of the country. For solar PV and solar thermal applications, the south and southeast 
of the country have the highest irradiation levels and annual direct normal irradiance 
(DNI), respectively. Indeed, these regions have considerable potential for solar thermal 
applications, such as space and water heating and low-enthalpy process heat in the 
industry and services sectors. Geothermal potential, although not extensively studied, 
is deemed to be most suitable for low-enthalpy heat processes throughout the country.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARYRenewables in Belarus comprise largely of biofuels,
followed by solar photovoltaic and wind, and increased 
steadily over the past decade to reach 7.1% of the
total primary energy supply in 2019 
Apart from renewable energy resources, Belarus does not have significant local energy 
resources. Thus, through the increased deployment of renewable energy technologies, 
Belarus would be able to increase its domestic energy supply, which would have a direct 
contribution towards the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), economic growth and 
energy sector security. Furthermore, greening the energy sector would directly reduce 
emissions, thereby supporting a sustainable and environmentally sound development 
pathway for the country. Increased renewable energy deployment would also contribute 
to local value creation, including employment opportunities and industrial development.
With a view to informing the development of a sustainable and secure energy sector 
in Belarus, this Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) identifies critical actions that 
could significantly increase the scale-up of renewable energy in the country, outlined in 
a number of key recommendations.
Revising renewable energy targets
To guide the development of renewables, Belarus has set out various renewable energy 
targets through multiple policy documents and plans. However, the targets are not 
always consistent with one another, and while some technology-specific targets were 
not met by the end of 2020, the national renewable energy target for 2025 has already 
been reached. This mismatch creates uncertainty about near-term continued renewable 
energy development and raises questions about the targets’ ambitiousness and 
relationship to other development objectives, such as energy security. Current targets 
need to be revised, streamlined and made consistent.Improving the quota allocation for renewables
The development of renewables in the power sector is enabled through yearly quotas 
that allocate the amounts of installed capacities per renewable energy technology 
for the coming three-year period. However, these quotas have been subject to many 
revisions and reductions that have adversely impacted investor confidence and limited 
the pace of the renewable energy sector’s growth. In addition, the quota allocations do 
not encourage larger-scale investments. To accelerate the development of renewables 
and allow for larger-scale investments, especially for solar PV and wind technologies, it 
is imperative that the allocated quota amounts be increased. Furthermore, the quotas 
should allow for biomass power development, and the current hydropower quotas 
should be allocated to other renewable technologies. Finally, the quota systems should 
not include renewable energy prosumers, and the quota allocation period should be 
extended to five years to allow investors to gauge the development of the sector. 
Designing renewable energy auctions
Renewable energy producers in Belarus sell their electricity to the off-taker at a feed-in 
tariff (FiT) that is calculated by applying different multiplier coefficients on the electricity 
base tariffs. However, electricity base tariffs do not truly reflect the unit cost of production, 
and the multiplier coefficients are low, leading stakeholders to deem the FiTs too low to 
attract the necessary investments at scale. To attract renewable energy investments, 
the country should look into developing renewable energy auctions, which can allow for 
market-based tariff setting of renewable power generation and have the potential for 
real price discovery. Furthermore, auctions can allow for well-planned and cost-efficient 
renewable energy deployment, and their transparent design and implementation can 
instil confidence in investors and reduce perceived market risks. 
Developing a law on energy and heat
Belarus has no primary act or base law on energy that holistically governs the energy 
sector, defining the energy system and the roles of the different energy sector entities. 
To compensate, local regulations ultimately fill this gap, creating inconsistencies among 
different regions. A telling example of this gap is that Belarus does not have a specific 
law governing its heat sector. As such, there is no comprehensive legal framework to 
incentivise the development of renewable energy in the respective end-use sector and 
support the sector’s decarbonisation. A dedicated and comprehensive legal framework 
for the energy sector is needed to assign legal enforcement mechanisms for the 
development of various energy sector programmes. Furthermore, a dedicated heat 
law could incentivise the development of renewables in heat supply and would signal a 
political commitment to the decarbonisation of the energy sector. 
Harnessing renewable energy potentials in heating
Belarus has high biomass potential, but the calorific value of different biomass feedstocks 
and fuel products needs further improvement. This is key because the country relies 
on outdated resource assessment standards that do not take into account different 
technological advancements for thermal extraction and processing of feedstocks into 
more calorie-dense fuel products. Furthermore, the unit price of biomass is based on 
mass or volume of the fuel, rather than per unit calorific value. Therefore, standardising 
the quality of biomass feedstocks and ensuring trading prices are based on quality 
standards are necessary in ensuring the technical and economic viability of biomass for heating. Moreover, the increased use of renewable energy sources in heating should 
be based on the integration of modern, technically and economically feasible energyefficient technologies, harnessing the country’s biomass, low-enthalpy geothermal and 
solar thermal resources, as well as energy-efficient heat pumps.
Developing an energy sector master plan with higher shares of renewables
The development of the energy sector in Belarus is guided by a number of cross-sector 
state programmes. However, it is necessary to integrate these cross-sector strategies 
into a master plan for an integrated development of the energy sector. The development 
of such a plan would facilitate sector-wide policy assessments, including environmental 
impacts and the infrastructural and financial needs of fulfilling wider development 
objectives. Furthermore, a master plan would allow for a more co-ordinated and holistic 
development approach to various renewable targets, quota allocations and auction 
rounds.
Adopting a grid code for renewables
The Belarus power system is in a relatively early stage of managing variable renewable 
power injection on the grid. To avoid any disturbances on the grid, renewable power 
producers are not given priority dispatch, but instead have to feed in power generated 
according to dispatch control centre schedules. In addition, a lack of technical standards 
for integration and uncertainty about technical requirements to connect to and feed 
into the grid introduce transmission or grid risks and significantly increase the cost 
of financing for renewables. A well-formulated national renewable energy grid code 
outlining procedural and technical requirements for variable renewable power producers 
feeding into the central grid will help to alleviate investment risk and allow for a level 
playing field for all power producers while also maintaining power system stability.
Improving variable renewable power generation forecasting
Variable renewable power forecasting is an essential and cost-effective tool for 
managing power system operations, balancing power supply and maintaining grid 
stability in power grids to which variable renewable power generators are connected. 
Currently in Belarus, wind and solar PV forecasting is not optimally integrated into daily 
scheduling and dispatch operations for power system balancing, and renewable energy 
generators are obliged to participate in the day-ahead scheduling. Short-term (zero to 
six hour) forecasting is crucial in predicting renewable energy production, and when 
intra-day adjustments of forecasted renewable energy production are not accounted for, 
power production uncertainty is created. This leads to unnecessary power curtailments 
for which renewable power producers are not compensated and which adds to power 
market risk for investors. To alleviate this investment risk and facilitate the increased 
integration of renewable power plants, short-term forecasting must be integrated into 
generation scheduling and dispatch operations. 
Improving de-risking mechanisms for renewable energy investments
Financing for renewable energy projects in Belarus is very low, and there is an overall 
shortage of both debt and equity financing. In particular, the local financial sector is 
inexperienced in green financing. Most investments have been facilitated through 
international capital. Furthermore, local financing comes at a very high cost, and 
commercial lending entails high interest rates and high collateral requirements due to 
numerous perceived risks. Clear financial sector policies for green financing should be developed with the national development bank, which should also include small-scale 
financing. Furthermore, establishing a dedicated renewable energy fund could be an 
effective way of providing public loans and de-risking mechanisms for renewable energy 
investments. 
Currency risk also adversely impacts the cost of international debt and equity financing. 
A significant amount of foreign financing in Belarus comes from Europe, so fixed prices 
in power purchase agreements (PPAs) should be at least partially indexed to the euro to 
increase the bankability of renewable energy investments. To alleviate off-taker risk, clear 
mitigation clauses should be included in a standardised PPA along with governmentbacked guarantees and letters of support. To mitigate the risk associated with permitting 
procedures, information on grid connection points should be made publicly available, 
and permitting procedures should be streamlined and consistent in each administrative 
region of the country.
Standardising power purchase agreements
PPAs for different renewable energy technologies in Belarus are not standardised, and 
the clauses within the contract are individually negotiated between the off-taker and 
the developer. Furthermore, PPAs are only signed once the renewable power plant has 
been built and commissioned, which introduces a significant risk for the developers, may 
jeopardise the bankability of their project and weakens their negotiating position. The 
lack of a PPA in the development phase of the renewable power project also adversely 
impacts the developer’s ability to obtain debt financing for the project in the first place. 
Standardised PPAs for different renewable energy technologies need to be developed, 
applied in all regions of the country and concluded with the developers after successful 
bidding. Throughout the duration of the PPA contract, a guaranteed fixed price for the 
sale of electricity needs to be applied, and clauses that clearly define non-compensable 
and compensable power curtailments need to be included. 
Building human and institutional capacities for renewable energy development
Developing an energy sector with an increased share of renewables requires competencies 
beyond those of the conventional fossil fuel-based system. These competencies are 
needed both at the institutional and the individual level. Within the public sector, 
planning and facilitating renewable energy deployment through incentive schemes are 
the two priority areas that require capacity strengthening. These include improvements 
in statistical data collection pertaining to electricity generated by renewable energy 
prosumers and capacity building in renewable energy auction design. 
The private sector’s capacity to ensure due diligence in the preparation of renewable 
energy project documentation also needs to be strengthened. Furthermore, practical 
skills at academic institutions and on-the-job training need to be enhanced to ensure 
a qualified workforce for the development of a renewable energy sector. Within the 
financial sector, there is a continued need for development partners to support local 
financial institutions with technical assistance in project appraisals, the creation of a 
local renewable energy financing impetus and the facilitation of experience sharing in 
renewable energy financing. The capacity of local institutions to innovate in the area of 
renewable energy technology should be enhanced through comprehensive co-operation 
of national scientific organisations with industrial and energy enterprises, international 
organisations, development partners and foreign researchers.1.1 RENEWABLES READINESS ASSESSMENT
The Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a tool developed by the International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to comprehensively evaluate the conditions 
for accelerated renewable energy deployment in a country. It is a country-led,
multi-stakeholder consultative process that allows for the identification of existing 
challenges for renewable energy deployment and recommends short to medium-term 
actions to guide decision makers and other stakeholders in addressing these challenges.
The RRA for Belarus was initiated by the State Committee for Standardisation of the 
Republic of Belarus (Gosstandart) in technical cooperation with IRENA. It has greatly 
benefitted from stakeholders’ inputs. Stakeholders in the RRA process included officials 
from ministries, utilities, power project developers, development partners, financial 
institutions, civil society and academia. 
As a first step of the RRA process, a background report on the energy sector in Belarus 
was developed that provided an overview and preliminary analysis of the energy sector 
context in Belarus. Thereafter, various interviews were held with institutional energy 
sector stakeholders in the country, supplemented with a set of detailed questionnaires 
aimed at further assessing the energy sector and determining the main barriers for 
renewable energy deployment. Based on desktop research, bilateral interviews and the 
questionnaires, an issue paper was developed highlighting some of the challenges for 
renewable energy deployment in the country. 
On this basis, a multi-stakeholder consultative workshop was organised by IRENA 
and Gosstandart on 9-10 February 2021. Over 35 representatives from governmental 
institutions, the private sector, development partners, civil society and academia 
attended. The workshop facilitated further discussions among stakeholders on the 
challenges in renewable energy deployment and allowed for the identification of 
recommended actions in overcoming these challenges. The outcomes of the consultation 
workshop, along with insights gained from bilateral consultations and the supporting 
documentation that was developed, constituted the basis for this RRA report. The RRA, 
with its recommended short to medium-term actions, was validated on 20 April 2021 at a 
virtual multi-stakeholder validation workshop attended by over 35 representatives from 
the energy sector in Belarus.
1 INTRODUCTION1.2 COUNTRY OVERVIEW
The Republic of Belarus is a landlocked country located in Eastern Europe bordered by 
the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. Its capital city is Minsk, 
located in the centre-west of the country. 
Belarus covers an area of 207600 square kilometres (km2), spanning about 650 km from east 
to west and 560 km from north to south. The topography of Belarus is mainly flat and lowlying. More than half of the country’s surface area is below 200 m of altitude, with the highest 
point of elevation at 346 m above sea level at Dzyarzhynskaya Hara in the vicinity of Minsk 
(Encyclopedia Britannica, 2020). Over 90% of the country is covered by natural vegetation, 
and about 40% of it is forested. The north of the country is predominantly characterised by 
gently sloping hills with many lakes, while the south is predominantly low-lying and mainly 
marshland. The largest and most significant river is the Dnieper, flowing through the east of 
the country, but other notable rivers include the Dvinar, Neman and Pripyat.
Belarus has a temperate continental climate, with warm summers and cold, humid winters. 
Average temperatures in winter range from -4.5 degrees Celsius (°C) in the southwest 
to -8°C in the northeast, while average temperatures in summer range between 17°C in 
the north to 18.5°C in the south (Belarus.by, 2020). Average annual precipitation ranges 
between 550 millimetres (mm) and 700 mm, with the highest precipitation seen in June 
and July (89 mm). Snow falls from November to March and is heaviest in January with an 
average of 24 snow days (Weather Atlas, 2020).

The population of Belarus numbered almost 9.5 million in 2019, with a decrease in 
population of 32 900 from the previous year. The population is largely urban: 78.4% of the 
population lives in urban settings, and over a fifth of the population, just under 2 million 
people, live in the capital city. More than half (57%) of the population is of working age 
(i.e., between the ages of 15 and 65 years) (BELSTAT, 2020a). The unemployment rate 
has been declining over the past few years and stood at 4.2% in 2019 (BELSTAT, 2020b). 
The country has a universal literacy rate, a 99% effective transition rate of students 
from primary to secondary education, and 87.4% gross enrolment in tertiary education 
(UNESCO Institute of Statistics, 2020). 
Governance structure
The government of Belarus consists of the prime minister, deputies and ministers who are 
accountable to the president and answerable to Parliament. The territory of the Republic 
of Belarus is divided into six regions (voblasti) and one municipality (horad). The regions 
(Brest, Gomel, Grodno, Minsk, Mogilev and Vitebsk) are administrative territorial units, 
while Minsk City is a municipality. The regions and municipality are further subdivided 
into 118 districts, whereby Minsk City alone has 9 districts. Furthermore, Belarus has 
1151 rural councils (BELSTAT, 2020c).

After the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991, Belarus 
experienced an economic downfall. In 1994, gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 
as much as 11.7%.1 As shown in Figure 3, soon thereafter, the economy started to grow 
due to an increase in labour productivity, favourable trading terms (mainly with the 
Russian Federation and the European Union [EU]), further development of the services 
and manufacturing industries, and an increase in exports. The largest contributor to the 
country’s GDP is the services sector (49%), followed by manufacturing (22%), agriculture 
(7%), construction (6%), and, lastly, supply of energy and mining (BELSTAT, 2020d). 
Within the services sector, wholesale and retail trade, motor vehicle repairs, transpiration, 
storage, information and communication, and real estate activities are some of the 
largest contributors to GDP. The country’s manufacturing industry includes machinery, 
minerals and metals, chemical products, textiles, and foodstuffs.
Following the global economic crisis in 2009, negative economic growth forced the 
government to introduce stringent monetary and fiscal policies that returned growth to 
the economy. In 2015, economic difficulties in the Russian Federation, a major trading 
partner, resulted in Belarus’s economy again declining by 3.82% (OECD, 2018). 
In 2019, the country’s GDP stood at approximately BYR 134 billion (Belarusian rubles; 
USD 61 billion [United States dollars]) with an annual increase of 1.6% over the previous 
year. In 2020, Belarus’s GDP fell to approximately 99.1% of its 2019 levels,2 a decline 
mainly attributed to the global COVID-19 pandemic (BELSTAT, 2020d).

the energy sector’s greenhouse gas emissions 
decreased by 41%
The supply3 of electricity, gas, steam and hot water contributes only 3% of GDP 
(BYR 3.95 billion, USD 1.9 billion) (BELSTAT, 2020d). This is largely due to very low 
domestic production of energy and an overreliance on energy imports. This in turn 
contributes to the seemingly weak correlation between total primary energy supply 
(TPES) and GDP as shown in Figure 4. Belarus imports most of its energy, particularly 
natural gas, from the Russian Federation at inexpensive prices. This has over time resulted 
in the high use of gas in both electricity and heat generation. Crude oil is also imported 
and refined into petroleum products for domestic use and for exports, mainly to Ukraine. 
In 2019, gross energy imports amounted to USD 9.9 billion and the net energy import 
balance was USD 3.6 billion (BELSTAT, 2020c), which significantly contributed to the 
country’s trade deficit. 
Although energy supply is not significantly correlated to GDP, the energy intensity of the 
economy (i.e., the ratio of gross inland energy consumption to GDP) is high in relative 
comparison to EU countries, which signals a continued need for energy efficiency 
measures. As is shown in Figure 5, the energy intensity by power purchasing parity of 
Belarus is much higher than the EU average.
3 Supply refers to all domestically produced electricity, gas, steam and hot water, and domestically provided services such as 
distribution and transmission and the sale of the same.

As shown in Figure 6, and according to the latest greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory, GHG 
emissions decreased by 32.5% in 2017 (93.96 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 
[MtCO2-eq]) from their 1990 levels (139.27 MtCO2-eq) excluding the land use, land use 
change and forestry sector (LULUCF). This fall can mainly be attributed to a decrease 
in emissions from the energy sector. The energy sector, which includes transport fuels, 
is the largest contributor to GHG emissions, contributing 61% of the total national 
emissions in 2017. However, when compared to 1990 emissions levels, the energy sector’s 
GHG emissions have decreased by 41%, owing to reduced energy consumption, the 
implementation of energy efficiency policies, and a change in fuel consumption structure 
with the decreased use of highly GHG-emitting coal and oil products in the industrial 
and services sectors. The agricultural sector is the second-largest contributor to GHG 
emissions (26%; 24.04 MtCO2-eq) but has decreased by 25% compared to 1990 levels 
owing to a decrease in agricultural production. Emissions from industrial processes and 
waste each contribute a further 6.5% of total GHG emissions (UNFCCC, 2019).
Investment environment
Capital investments in Belarus amounted to USD 11.3 billion in 2019. Investments were 
primarily in the manufacturing industry (USD2.58billion) and real estate (USD2.57billion), 
followed by USD 1.3 billion in agriculture, forestry and fisheries and USD 1.2 billion in 
the supply of electricity, gas, steam, hot water and air conditioning (BELSTAT, 2020f). 
Foreign investment in the country is relatively limited, but has been rising in recent years. 
In 2019, gross foreign investment flow into Belarus amounted to just over USD 10 billion, 
and the net inflow of foreign direct investment was USD 1.33 billion (BELSTAT, 2020g).

Note: ktCO2eq = kilotonne of carbon dioxide equivalentThe corporate tax rate stands at 18% and at 25% for banks, insurance companies and 
foreign exchange companies. A flat tax rate of 13% is imposed on personal incomes, and 
the standard rate of value added tax (VAT) is 20% on most supplied products, services 
and imports, rising to 25% for telecommunications (Deloitte, 2021). 
According to the World Banks’ Ease of Doing Business ranking, Belarus is ranked
49th globally (out of 190) and 11th (out of 24) in the European and Central Asian region 
(World Bank, 2020a). The highest ranking category is “getting electricity”, for which 
Belarus ranks third in the European and Central Asian region. This is due to minimal 
administrative procedures for electricity connection, the costs for each procedure, and 
the reliability of electricity supply and transparent communication on tariffs and tariff 
changes. There are only three administrative procedures for obtaining an electricity 
connection, which take approximately 105 calendar days to complete. The cost for 
electricity connection is 84.4% of the average monthly income per capita, which is 
considered relatively low in comparison to the region (World Bank, 2020a). Moreover, 
the reliability of electricity supply is high, with a system average interruption duration 
index5 of 0.5, owing to the country’s automated tools for monitoring outages and 
restoring services efficiently. Effective tariffs are readily available online and customers 
are notified of tariff changes well ahead of billing cycles.
Financial sector
The financial sector in Belarus is dominated by banks, of which commercial banks 
represent approximately 85% of the total financial assets (valued at about three-quarters 
of the national GDP). The Belarus Development Bank represents 7% of total financial 
assets, while leasing, microcredit and insurance companies account for roughly 5%. The 
banking sector comprises 27 banks, of which 19 have some degree of foreign capital. 
Nonetheless, the sector is dominated by state-owned banks, which account for about 
65% of the banking sector’s assets. Five of the largest banks account for close to threequarters of the capital.
At the end of 2017, the loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 140%, rendering banks relatively 
non-liquid. Thus, intermediation levels were low, and domestic credit to the private sector 
amounted to 25.8% of GDP in 2016. Non-performing loans stood at 13%. Performing 
loans were largely household borrower loans which, as a result, are rated as least risk. 
The banking sector is highly dollarised, with the share of foreign currency deposits at 
70% (EIB, 2018). As such, it is subject to risks in exchange rate depreciation. Nonetheless, 
most of the state-owned enterprises, with their significant contribution of deposits to the 
banking sector and critical role in the economy, are unhedged from currency risk.

number of hours of interruption incurred by an average customer in a year

Source: World Bank (2020a)Concessional financing by international financial institutions (IFIs) has been the largest 
proponent of green financing in Belarus, although the IFIs’ involvement has slowed 
down recently. Although IFI financing is provided with more favourable terms, for public 
project financing, IFIs perceive municipalities and state-owned enterprises to have rather 
low creditworthiness and therefore almost always require a sovereign loan guarantee. 
Such guarantees need to be approved by Parliament before lending. Given that the state 
is wary of the level of debt, such financing instruments are not always readily taken up.
A bond market is also present in Belarus. Foreign bonds, i.e., bonds issued by foreign 
entities in local currency, can only be accessed by the state and are otherwise not 
possible in Belarus. Local bonds make up only about 10% of the total bond market and 
are mainly issued by the administrative regions. Bond revenues that are tax exempt exist, 
but their interest rates are high and their tenures are short, which ultimately impedes 
their utilisation (EuropAid, 2020).
Regional co-operation
Belarus participates in several regional unions and bilateral agreements. It is a member 
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)5 along with 11 neighbouring countries. 
The CIS member states have agreed to form a common economic space for the free 
movement of goods, services, workforce and capital, and to harmonise monetary policies 
on tax, pricing, customs and external relations (CIS, 2020). Through the CIS, Belarus 
committed to implementing various bilateral and international treaties concerning 
regional energy sector relations and power system operations.
In advancing the agreements under the CIS, since 2015, Belarus has been a member 
of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), along with Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan 
and the Russian Federation. The EAEU members agreed to “develop long-term mutually 
beneficial cooperation in the energy sector, conduct coordinated energy policies and 
gradually create common energy markets with a view to ensuring energy security”
(EnC, 2018). The member states are working towards conceptualising the creation 
of a common electricity market based on agreed principles, including a stepwise 
transformation and unbundling of vertically integrated state-owned power companies, 
a common electricity market model and a synchronous operation of member states’ 
power systems.
Belarus also participates in the Armenia-Belarus-Kazakhstan-Kyrgyzstan-Russian 
Federation Common Economic Space (CES). The CES’s objectives are to facilitate the 
free movement of goods, services, capital and workforce among its member countries. 
Belarus also participates in the European Commission’s Eastern Partnership (EaP) 
programme, which aims to strengthen relations between the EU’s member states and 
its eastern neighbouring countries, namely Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, 
Moldova and Ukraine (European Commission, 2020). Under the EaP, four main priority 
areas for co-operation are established, including economy, governance, connectivity 
(power connectivity, energy efficiency, climate change) and society. Belarus is also a 
part of the EU4Energy Programme, which aims to strengthen energy statistics, energy 
policy design and regulatory frameworks and facilitate access to information among the 
partner countries of the programme.
5 The CIS includes the following member states: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, 
Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.2.1 ENERGY BALANCE
Total primary energy supply
The energy mix of Belarus is overwhelmingly fossil-fuel based. In 2019, Belarus’s TPES 
amounted to 26 607 ktoe, of which the largest share was natural gas at 62% of TPES, 
followed by oil at 28%, and biofuel and waste at 6%. The total share of renewables in the 
TPES was 7.1% (BELSTAT, 2020e).

Energy exports and imports 
Belarus is highly dependent on energy imports, mainly from the Russian Federation, 
and is one of the world’s leading energy import-dependent countries. The country’s 
energy sufficiency, or the ratio of energy produced nationally compared to TPES, is 
valued at only 16.5%. The bulk of the energy supply is covered by energy imports, which 
amount to 84.8% of the TPES (BELSTAT, 2020c). 
Figure 8 compares domestic energy production and supply of energy by fuel. The 
largest fuel import dependency is natural gas. Only 2% of natural gas supplied is 
produced locally, which makes Belarus one of the countries most dependent on natural 
gas imports in the world. Crude oil is imported in similar quantities, but is refined and 
exported in significant amounts to Ukraine. Final energy consumption
The final energy consumption is 70% of the TPES (i.e., 18 505 ktoe), with transformation, 
distribution and non-energy use losses accounting for 15%, 4% and 12%, respectively. 
As is shown in Figure 9, heat6 is the largest share of final energy consumption (30%), 
followed by transport fuel (26%), natural and liquid petroleum gas (21%), electricity 
(15%), and lastly by biomass, coal and peat (BELSTAT, 2020e).

Figure 11 Final energy consumption in sectors by carrier/fuel, 20192.2 ELECTRICITY BALANCE
The production of electricity has significantly increased in recent years with 
increased installed capacities. Since 2005, when electricity production stood at 
31 terawatt hours (TWh), production has increased by over 30%. In 2019, production 
amounted to 40.5 TWh. Figure 12 shows the steady increase in electricity production 
over recent years and a very slight increase in the renewable energy share. Electricity is 
largely produced by thermal power plants (98.3% of total electricity production), which 
are predominantly fuelled by natural gas. Hydropower, solar PV and wind power account 
for 0.9%, 0.5% and 0.4% of electricity production, respectively (BELSTAT, 2020h).

Until 2017, Belarus imported more electricity than it exported. However, with the 
additional installed capacities and energy efficiency measures, in 2018 it became a net 
electricity exporter, net exporting 2 338 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity by 2019 – the 
equivalent of 5.8% of its total electricity production (BELSTAT, 2020h). Electricity is 
exported to Ukraine and the Baltic states.
In 2019, after accounting for exports and imports, the total available electricity supply 
amounted to 38.1 TWh, of which 94.3% was supplied by BelEnergo (35.9 TWh)
(BelEnergo, 2020a). Finally, after accounting for own power use by power plants 
(2.2 TWh; 5.8%) and electricity transmission and distribution losses (2.7 TWh; 7.1%), the 
final electricity consumption in 2019 was 33.2 TWh (BELSTAT, 2020h).2.3 HEAT BALANCE
Belarus has a vast district heating network serving about 70% of the population (Euroheat 
& Power, 2017). Heat is largely produced by combined heat and power (CHP) plants 
fuelled by natural gas, while renewables account for 10.6% of the total heat production. 
The renewable share in heat production is almost entirely based on biomass, and 
negligible amounts (0.02%) of geothermal and solar thermal heat production. In 2019, 
the total heat production amounted to 59 269 tera calorie (Tcal). Heat distribution losses 
accounted for 7.3% of production, which rendered final heat consumption 54 971 Tcal
(BELSTAT, 2020i).

2.4 POWER INFRASTRUCTURE
At the end of 2019, installed power generation capacities in Belarus amounted to 10297 megawatts (MW), 
of which 391.8 MW were renewable energy power plants. Solar PV was the largest renewable energy 
installed capacity (154.3 MW), followed by wind (106.1 MW) and hydropower (95.7 MW). Over 86% of 
installed capacities were owned by BelEnergo, while the rest were owned privately or by local districts. 
BelEnergo’s power plants included 42 thermal power plants, 25 hydroelectric power plants and 1 wind 
power plant. In November 2020, Belarus commissioned its first 1.11 GW nuclear power plant.Belarus’s power grid system consists of 279 730 km of transmission, distribution and 
interconnection lines and a total of 1 357 transformer substations. Distribution lines 
are exclusively 0.4 kilovolts (kV) to 35 kV, while 110 kV lines serve both distribution 
and transmission of power. As shown in Figure 16, the main transmission network is 
represented by 110-330 kV transmission lines, 110-330 kV substations and high-pressure 
power plant switchgears. In terms of regional interconnections, one 750-kV overhead 
line, along with three 330-kV lines, connect the Belarusian power system with that of the 
Russian Federation. Furthermore, two 330-kV lines connect Belarus to Ukraine, five 330-
kV lines connect to Lithuania, while one 220-kV and two 110-kV lines connect to Poland. 
Belarus transits electricity from mainland Russian Federation to the Russian region of 
Kaliningrad, Poland and, until recently, to Lithuania. Since the commissioning of Belarus’s 
nuclear power plant, Lithuania has blocked the electricity inflow from Belarus. 
In terms of e-mobility infrastructure in Belarus, there are currently some 350 electric 
cars, public transport fleets (including 119 electric buses and 1 900 trolley buses) and 
251 fast and slow charging stations owned by the Belarusian automobile fuel retailer 
Belorusneft. The uptake of electric cars has gained momentum, and the country plans to 
install 600 charging stations by the end of 2021 and have 30000 electric vehicles on the 
road by 2025 (EMEurope, 2019).

State policy and regulation within the energy sector, including energy efficiency and 
renewable energy, is ultimately implemented through decrees and directives adopted by 
the president of the Republic of Belarus. The Council of Ministers adopts resolutions to 
guide energy sector development strategies, ensure the implementation of policies and 
regulate residential end-user energy tariffs upon the president’s approval. Legislative 
measures within the energy sector are prepared by the Ministry of Energy and experts in 
the sector before they are submitted for approval through the National Assembly.
In terms of energy sector regulation, there is no single independent body acting as 
an energy regulatory authority. Instead, residential energy tariffs are regulated by the 
Council of Ministers and approved by the president, while electricity and heat tariffs 
for all non-residential sectors, including tariffs for electricity and heat sales to industry 
and for electricity sale by independent power producers (IPPs), are regulated by the 
Ministry of Anti-Monopoly Regulation and Trade (MART). The role of key institutional 
stakeholders in the energy sector is discussed below, and Figure 17 schematically outlines 
the institutional governance structure of the sector.

the implementation of the commitments under the Paris Agreement and the nationally 
determined contributions (NDC).
BelEnergoState Production Association of the Electric Power Industry (BelEnergo SPA)
is primarily a vertically integrated, fully state-owned electricity and heat producer, supplier 
and retailer. The association employs 65000 employees and comprises 27 organisations
including regional energy supplying companies; companies for construction, design 
and installation of energy; and other organisations, such as training institutions. Its 
main operational objective is to ensure reliable and uninterrupted electricity and heat 
supply to end users. BelEnergo’s main activities include the production, transmission, 
distribution and sale of electricity and heat; operational dispatch control; power plant and 
supply network maintenance; and other responsibilities for energy system development
(e.g., demand forecasting, investment planning, etc.). BelEnergo is a natural monopoly 
for energy transmission and distribution, as required by law.7 It is the dominant electricity 
generator and the supplier of about 50% of the heat supply. The remainder of the heat 
supply is provided by municipal district heating companies (IEA, 2020a). Electricity 
and heat generation, transmission, distribution and sale are carried out by six regional 
vertically integrated subsidiaries of BelEnergo, Oblenergos: Minskenergo, Brestenergo, 
Vitebskenergo, Gomelenergo, Grodmoenergo and Mogilevenergo (BelEnergo, 2020c). 
BelEnergo reports to the Ministry of Energy annually and to Parliament occasionally. By 
monitoring electricity and heat supply and demand trends it prepares energy forecasts 
and energy sector development plans to guide investments in energy infrastructure.

www.energo.by/content/about/sovet-gpo-belenergo/.BelTransGas is fully owned by Russias Gazprom and is tasked with the operation of the 
natural gas transit pipelines in Belarus, and thereby the transportation of natural gas 
from the Russian Federation to neighbouring countries/regions such as Ukraine, Poland, 
Lithuania and Kaliningrad, as well as to Germany through the Yamal-Europe transmission 
pipeline.
BelTopGas Fuel and Gasification State-Owned Production Association (BelTopGas 
SPA) is the state-owned supplier of gas to Minsk and the six regions of Belarus. It 
incorporates seven regional supply companies and is answerable to the Ministry of Energy. 
It is tasked with providing a reliable and uninterrupted supply of natural and liquefied 
gas to consumers, operating the gas distribution network, and building gas retail and 
sales infrastructure. It is also responsible for peat extraction and processing as well as the 
production of fuel briquettes for local consumers and export (Beltopgas, 2020).
The National Statistical Committee of the Republic of Belarus (BELSTAT) is tasked with 
administering national data services by collecting, processing and publishing national 
statistics. As part of energy statistics, BELSTAT prepares energy balances, which it 
collects and prepares in co-operation with relevant stakeholders, such as the Ministry 
Energy and energy enterprises.
The Department of Energy Efficiency at the State Committee for Standardisation of 
the Republic of Belarus (Gosstandart) is tasked with the drafting and implementation 
of energy efficiency and renewable energy policies. Furthermore, it sets out standards, 
norms and requirements for achieving energy efficiency through monitoring compliance 
of energy-saving products and services, technical and economic compliance of energy 
generating equipment, and rational use of energy and fuel resources in the country. It 
also develops financial measures for encouraging energy efficiency.
The Ministry of Economy is responsible for regulation and manages analysis and 
forecasts pertaining to social and economic development in Belarus. It is tasked with 
the development and implementation of economic reforms and policies. This includes 
nurturing entrepreneurship and investments, and privatisation of state-owned enterprises 
(Ministry of Economy, 2020a). 
IPPs are also numerous and have been increasing their presence in the energy landscape 
of Belarus. IPPs are predominantly renewable energy power producers who sell their 
electricity to the off-taker, BelEnergo, at feed-in tariff (FiT) prices. In addition, legal 
entities produce renewable power for self-consumption. These account for about 50% of 
the renewable energy production in Belarus.
2.5 ENERGY SECTOR POLICY AND LEGISLATION 
Belarus’s energy policy strives for a reliable, affordable and sustainable energy sector 
with greater energy security through the reduction of energy imports. As such, the 
sector aims to reduce over-reliance on imported oil and gas and promote renewable 
energy and energy efficiency while also commissioning its first nuclear power plant. 
Developing local energy resources, reducing energy intensity through energy efficiency 
measures and diversifying away from natural gas in the energy mix have been embraced 
as critical in achieving the overall sector goals. While there is no comprehensive law on 
energy, nor specific laws on heat and electricity, several normative legal acts govern the 
energy sector instead, as outlined below.Resolution of the Council of Ministers On Approval of Electricity Supply Rules No. 1394, 
dated 17 October 2011 with the latest amendment on 25 May 2020, governs procedures 
for connections to the state electricity grid by legal entities, individual entrepreneurs 
and citizens. It obliges the regional electricity companies (Oblenergos – see Chapter 2, 
Section 5) to offer energy suppliers access to the grid and defines the technical conditions 
for connection. The resolution sets out the responsibilities of each entity and obliges 
renewable energy producers to relay real-time information on power production to the 
Oblenergos. It also sets out the procedure for concluding a power supply contract with 
energy producers.
Law On Energy Savings 2015 specifies the use and implementation of energy-efficient 
technologies, as well as the requirements for energy-efficient equipment. The law also 
makes provisions for the creation of energy efficiency policies.
Resolution of the Council of Ministers On Issues in the Field of Heat Supply No. 609, 
11 September 2019, approved the heat supply regulations concerning end user relations 
with suppliers, payment procedures and the connection of individual heat consumption 
systems to the heat network (Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus, 2019).
The energy sector is further governed by the Law on Gas Supply (2003) and the Law 
on Nuclear Energy (2008). Also relevant to the energy sector are the Law on Industrial 
Safety and the Law on Environmental Protection. 
Currently, there is no specific legislation governing the electricity sector or an electricity 
market in Belarus. In 2019, Belarus signed the amended Treaty on EAEU for the formation 
of a common EAEU electricity market. However, given that Belarus does not have a law 
on electricity markets that includes rules governing wholesale and retail of electricity in a 
market framework, there is currently no basis for energy companies to participate in the 
EAEU’s common energy market. There are, however, plans to develop a law on electricity 
markets that would restructure the power sector and set out separate activities for 
competitive and non-competitive market segments, and govern the relations between 
electricity providers and end users. The Ministry of Energy has drafted such a law, which 
has been submitted to the Council of Ministers, but not yet passed on to Parliament. The 
draft law also aims to harmonise national legislation with the EAEU Treaty and strives for 
satisfying domestic electricity demand before trading across borders.
Specific renewable energy legislation is further outlined in Chapter 3, Section 2.
The main policy document for the development of the energy sector in Belarus is the 
third edition of the Concept of Energy Security of the Republic of Belarus, approved 
by the Council of Ministers by Resolution No. 1084 in 2015 and effective as of 2016.
It lays out the long-term policy guidelines for the development of the energy sector until 
2035 and includes the following key objectives (Council of Ministers of the Republic of 
Belarus, 2015):
• decreasing dependence on energy imports by increasing energy sufficiency8
 to 20% 
in 2030 (14% in 2015; 16.5% in 2019)
• diversifying energy resources through a greater participation of renewable energy 
and nuclear power in the energy mix
• diversifying energy suppliers by reducing the share of the major energy supplier in 
total energy imports to 70% in 2035 (90% in 2015)• ensuring reliability of energy supply
• increasing energy efficiency in end use through modernisation of the energy system 
• increasing economic and energy efficiency in energy generation and distribution 
through enabling legal frameworks and upgrading of grid infrastructure
• ensuring end user affordability of energy while phasing out subsidies for electricity 
and heat
• developing international co-operation with leading energy organisations and 
expanding energy exports to EU countries 
• developing a dedicated law on electricity
• creating a wholesale electricity market
• providing a scientific evidence base for the development of the energy sector including 
technological advances, energy resource assessments, environmental safeguarding, 
and demand and supply side management.
A summary of the key targets for the development of the energy sector until 2035 are 
highlighted in the table below. 
In April 2016, the State Programme for Energy Saving 2016-2020 reinstated some of 
the targets above, set forth further targets for the deployment of renewable energy by 
2020 and identified monitoring measures in tracking the progress of those targets on 
an annual basis. It defined financial resources and various challenges in achieving the 
planned targets; however, it lacked concrete implementable measures to achieve the 
same. Solar PV and wind capacity targets were not reached by the end of 2020. The key 
targets set out in the programme included (EnC, 2018):
• renewable energy share in the TPES to reach at least 6% by 2020 
• domestically sourced primary energy to account for at least 16% of TPES by 2020
• energy intensity of GDP to be reduced by at least 2% by 2020 compared to 2015 levels
• operationalisation of 135 power plants using renewable resources by 2020
• total hydropower capacity of 80 MW by 2020

systems
• total wind power capacity of 200 MW by 2020
• increased production and use of biomass, including increased use of biofuels in the 
transport sector (without targets)
• increased uptake of solar water heaters, such as for drying products in agriculture, 
and water heating in the residential sector (without targets).
In February 2021, a new State Programme for Energy Saving 2021-2025 was adopted 
that set out a new renewable energy target by 2025, namely an 8% share of renewable 
energy production in the TPES in 2025. The programme also aims to reduce the energy 
intensity of the GDP by 2026 by at least 7% compared to its 2020 level. It also puts 
forward increased energy efficiency strategies and specific projects for the development 
of biomass and electric heat pumps in heat supply. Furthermore, the document lays 
out the financial resources for the programme and defines the risks and risk mitigating 
mechanisms for the execution of the programme. The main risks are related to adequate 
funding for the programme, timely adjustment of the consolidated targets and indicators 
in the Concept of Energy Security, and timely registration of planned changes in 
legislation. 
Specifically for the power sector, the Comprehensive Plan for the Development of 
the Electric Power Industry until 2025 was approved by the Decree of the Council of 
Ministers by Resolution No. 169 in 2016, and lays out specific implementation activities 
and timelines for the development of the electricity sector until 2025. It includes the 
following key elements:
• phase out electricity tariffs subsidy by 2020
• unbundle the electricity sector by 2025
• create a wholesale and retail electricity market
• commission a nuclear power plant (NPP) of 2 400 MW by 2020
• integrate the NPP grid by installing 985 MW of electric boilers with BelEnergo
• reduce the share of natural gas in heat and electricity supply to 60% by 2025
• increase reserve power capacity by an additional 800 MW
expand charging infrastructure for e-vehicles .
The Sectoral Programme of Electricity System Development for 2016-2020
foresaw the restructuring of the power sector, and the unbundling of vertically 
integrated BelEnergo into separate generation, transmission, distribution and sales 
entities – activities that to date have not been achieved. In addition, the programme 
aimed to develop legislation for electricity regulation by setting out the operational 
relations between the state and power sector entities, limiting the degree of state 
involvement in regulating energy tariffs, and drawing up the foundations for a wholesale 
and retail energy market (IEA, 2020a).Although not a state programme initiated by the Council of Ministers, the Programme 
for the Development of Charging Infrastructure and Electric Transport 2016-2025 
supplements the Presidential Decree on Stimulating the Use of Electric Vehicles. The 
decree passed an incentive that all electric vehicle permits will be issued with waived 
fees and that the state enterprise Belorusneft will be the state operator for the creation 
and development of a charging network for electric vehicles. The programme foresees 
the introduction of up to 30000 electric vehicles by 2025 (EMEurope, 2019).
The government of Belarus also put in place various policies on mitigating the effects 
of climate change and the reduction of GHG emissions. In 2005, Belarus ratified the 
Kyoto Protocol whereby the country committed to the reduction of GHG emissions by 
8% compared to 1990 levels within the 2008-2012 period, and a 12% reduction for the 
period 2013-2020. The target of 12% was later revised to 8% at the Doha Conference of 
Parties in December 2012. Consequently, a State Programme of Measures to Mitigate 
the Effects of Climate Change for 2012-2020 was enacted that aimed to reduce GHG 
emissions by 8% in 2020 compared to 1990 levels. This amounts to approximately 
11 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (MtCO2-eq). In 2016, Belarus submitted 
its intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) following the 21st Conference 
of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, pledging to reduce its GHG emissions by at least 28% in 
2030 compared to its 1990 levels (excluding LULUCF). The achievement of this target 
is not dependent on carbon market mechanisms or development funds. The INDC is in 
line with the National Sustainable Development Strategy of the Republic of Belarus. The 
measures to achieve this reduction include increasing energy efficiency, reforestation 
(to 41% of forest cover in 2030), restoration of peat lands (to at least 60000 hectares 
[ha] by 2030), conservation of natural ecosystems (with protected areas covering
8.8% by 2030), and improved legal and regulatory approaches (UNFCCC, 2016). However, 
the INDC does not feature potential renewable energy contributions. An updated NDC is 
currently being drafted and is to be finalised by the end of 2021.
2.7 ENERGY PRICES
Consumer energy pricing in Belarus is based on a complex system of cross-subsidisation 
whose tariff-setting procedure is based on Law No. 255-3 “On Pricing”, and the Resolution 
of Council of Ministers No. 222. The tariff-setting methodology is based on a “base price” 
tariff that should represent the real cost of the unit energy production, transport, repair 
services, depreciation of funds, salaries and social contributions, taxes, and normative 
profits. The Ministry of Anti-Monopoly Regulation and Trade sets the base tariff based 
on information provided by BelEnergo (for heat and electricity cost estimates) and 
BelTopGas (for natural gas and liquid petroleum gas [LPG] cost estimates). However, it is 
argued that the base price does not truly reflect cost recovery. For certain groups of endusers, energy tariffs are set below the base tariff, and the shortfall is cross-subsidised 
from higher-tariff end users.
For natural gas, the import price is agreed upon between BelTransGas and the Ministry 
of Energy. Tariffs for gas consumption by residential consumers are cross-subsidised 
by higher base tariffs for industrial consumers, although some industrial consumers, 
such as glass, chemical and fertiliser manufacturers, are also subsidised. Residential 
consumer tariffs are differentiated by period of year (i.e., during the heating season, 
tariffs are lower), total consumption volumes and whether the household uses gas 
boilers and meters.Heat tariffs are differentiated by type of consumer, i.e., residential, industry, public 
institutions and by region. According to a World Bank study, residential heat tariffs are 
between 10% and 21%10 of the actual unit production cost (World Bank, 2014).
Electricity tariffs are set according to the consumer group and are further differentiated 
by time of consumption (i.e., peak and off-peak hours). For industrial consumers with 
a connection capacity of up to 750 kVA (including electrified public transport, pubic 
institutions and public lighting) a flat rate tariff is applied, while industrial consumers 
with a connection capacity above 750 kVA have a monthly fee on top of the flat-rate 
tariff. For residential consumers, the tariff is differentiated by time of consumption and 
by electricity use (i.e., households with electric stoves have a lower tariff than households 
using gas stoves). Organisations such as health clinics and other public institutions and 
religious institutions have a residential tariff applied (OECD, 2018).

SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
3.1 RESOURCE POTENTIAL
Renewable energy is in a nascent stage in the Belarusian energy sector. The share of primary 
energy supply from renewables has been steadily increasing over the past decade and in 
2019 stood at 7.1%. This share largely comprises biofuels and, to a lesser extent, solar PV and 
wind. Nonetheless, the country is well endowed with renewable energy resource potential 
that presents a viable and sustainable pathway for the development of the energy sector. 
Biomass
Biomass is the most abundant renewable energy resource in the country. Much biomass 
potential lies in wood resources, including residues, given the vast expanses of forests11
covering approximately 40% of the country’s surface area. Waste wood resources that 
can be used for bioenergy production are estimated at 1.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) 
with an annual growth of 0.03 bcm (IEA, 2016). According to the National Programme 
on Local and Renewable Energy Development for 2011-15, solid biomass potential is 
valued at 2.2 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe)/year, while a further 1.7 Mtoe/year 
is estimated from agricultural waste (crop residues and straw). Currently, solid biomass 
is utilised for heat production in heat and cogeneration power plants and boilers, and 
8.9 MW is installed for power production (Ministry of Economy, 2018).

opinion on the part of IRENA concerning the status of any region, country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning
the delimitation of frontiers or boundaries.The potential for biogas production is significant in Belarus, owing to the large quantities 
of manure available from cattle and poultry farming, residues from crop farming, waste 
from the food industry, municipal waste and sewage from treatment facilities. Resource 
assessment studies for biogas potential from these waste sources have not been 
extensively undertaken; however, several approximations have been made. Namely, 
these potentials include 2.3 Mtoe/year of biogas production from animal manure and 
0.3 Mtoe/year from municipal solid waste. In 2019, the installed capacity of biogas power 
plants was 26.8 MW (Ministry of Economy, 2018).
Biofuel production in the form of bioethanol and biodiesel is deemed significant, albeit 
understudied. The potential for biofuel production is due to the significant agricultural 
activities, sugar production, and starch and cellulose industries in Belarus.
Hydropower
Given Belarus’s relatively flat topography, the country’s potential for large hydropower 
development is insignificant, although the potential for small-scale hydropower (<10 MW) 
production is feasible in the northern and central regions of the country. The potential 
hydropower capacity of all bodies of water in Belarus is estimated at 850 MW, of which 
the technical potential is estimated at 520 MW and economic potential is estimated at 
250 MW (UNIDO and ICSHP, 2013). 
Historically, Belarus had a large number of very small-scale hydropower plants for 
electricity production in rural areas and for productive uses, such as sawmills and 
flourmills. With the expansion of the centralised grid, most of these plants became 
obsolete and were decommissioned. Currently, the installed hydropower capacity is 
95.7 MW, of which 88.1 MW is owned by BelEnergo (BelEnergo, 2020b).

Source: Greenworld.org (2020)Wind
Average annual wind speeds are above 6 m/s (at 100 m hub height) in almost all areas 
of the country (see Figure 20). In the north, northwest and around Minsk, average annual 
wind speeds can reach up to 8 m/s, signalling high-quality resource potential for wind 
power development in the country. In 2019, the installed wind power capacity was 
106.1 MW, of which 9 MW were owned by BelEnergo (BelEnergo, 2020b). 
Solar
The annual global horizontal irradiation (GHI) in Belarus is between 1000 kWh/m2 and 
1170 kWh/m2, with the highest irradiation in the south and southeast of the country, 
indicating significant potential for solar PV development (see Figure 21). In the highpotential areas, solar PV generation yield can reach over 1100 kWh/kWp annually. In the 
rest of the country it can reach well above 1020 kWh/kWp (see Figure 22). 
For solar thermal applications, the regions with the highest potential are Brest and Gomel 
in the south and southeast of the country, which receive on average 60 clear days per 
year and a direct normal irradiance (DNI) of more than 1050 kWh/m2 (see Figure 23). 
In general, the country has potential for solar thermal applications, such as for space 
and water heating and low-enthalpy process heat in the industry and services sectors
(IEA, 2016).

Note: PVOUT = the amount of power generated per unit of the installed PV capacityGeothermal
The potential for geothermal is inadequately assessed to date, with studies carried 
out on only a few regions. In 2018, the first geothermal atlas of Belarus was published, 
consisting of around 50 detailed maps of the Pripyat Trough showing the most promising 
geothermal wells at depths between 100 m and 4 km. The atlas includes geothermal 
gradients, heat flow density and geothermal resources. Although some estimates show 
that temperatures of 150°C to 180°C are available within the crystalline basement of up 
to 6 km depths, they are not economically feasible for exploitation. As such, Belarus’s 
geothermal resources are not deemed significant enough for power generation 
(Dubanevich and Zui, 2019). 
In general, geothermal potential is deemed to be most suitable for low-enthalpy heat 
processes throughout the country. The most promising sites are in the Pripyat Trough in 
the south of the country and in the Brest region (IEA, 2016). Given the potential for the 
integration of low-enthalpy geothermal resources into Belarus’s district energy systems, 
in February 2021, IRENA, together with the State Committee for Standardisation of the 
Republic of Belarus and with technical input from Aalborg University in Denmark, organised 
a workshop titled “Integrating low-temperature renewable energy sources in district 
heating and cooling systems”. The objective of the workshop was to equip district heating 
stakeholders in Belarus (including policy makers at the national, regional and local levels; 
urban planners; and district heating operators/utilities) with various options and tools for

sets out a renewable energy target by 2025 of 8% 
renewable energy share in the total primary
energy supply 
As of 2019, Belarus had just under 300 geothermal heat pump installations of under 
13 MW of installed capacity, which are mainly used for space heating and hot water 
supply in cottages and hospitals. The largest geothermal installation (two heat pumps 
with a collective output of 1010 KW) is located at a greenhouse complex in the Brest 
region, where the water temperature reaches 24°C and flows at about 42 m3 per hour 
(Dubanevich and Zui, 2019).
3.2 RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY AND REGULATION
As discussed in Chapter 2, Section 6 (2.5 Energy sector policy and legislation), the 
energy sector aims to reduce its over-reliance on imported oil and gas and promote 
renewable energy and energy efficiency while also commissioning the country’s first 
nuclear power plant (NPP). Developing local energy resources, reducing energy intensity 
through energy efficiency measures and diversifying away from natural gas in the 
energy mix have been embraced as critical in achieving the overall sector goals. As such, 
the deployment of renewables is central in fulfilling the energy sector’s development 
goals. According to the newly adopted State Programme on Energy Saving 2021-2025, 
the renewable energy target by 2025 is an 8% renewable energy share in the TPES, 
which differs from the 7% renewable energy share of the TPES by 2025 as set out in the 
Concept for Energy Security. Several legal acts governing the deployment of renewables 
in Belarus are discussed below.
In 2010, Belarus passed its first law On Renewable Energy Sources No. 204-3. The key 
elements in the law are outlined below.
• regulation of the promotion of the use of renewable energy sources and installations 
and the manufacturing and procurement of renewable energy equipment
• provision for private investors to build and operate renewable energy generation 
plants
• guarantee for non-discriminative connection to the grid for renewable energy 
suppliers 
• provision for favourable pricing of renewable energy supply to encourage the use of 
and investment in renewables 
• provision for tax concessions in accordance with legislation for renewable energy 
investments
• obligation of the Oblenergos to purchase electricity from renewable energy generation
• exemption of customs duties for imported equipment related to the generation, 
transmission, consumption, storage and conversion of electricity from renewable 
energy sources.In 2015, the Resolution of the Council of Ministers On the Establishment, Distribution, 
Release and Withdrawal of Quotas for the Creation of Installations for the Use of 
Renewable Energy Sources No. 662 was passed. The resolution set out the regulation for 
setting of annual capacity quotas for various renewable energy. Soon thereafter, in 2017, 
the Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 305 revised the procedure for determining 
and allocating energy generation quotas. The resolution redefined the composition of 
the committee for the determination and allocation of quotas for renewable energy 
generation. It further stipulates that if, during the tender bidding process, more than 
one bidder submits the same bid, the committee is authorised to invite the bidders for 
negotiation. The allocated quotas have been revised several times. The current approved 
quotas for the period 2021-2023 are presented in Table 6.
In 2019, the Presidential Decree On Renewable Energy Sources No. 357 was passed that 
supersedes various aspects of the aforementioned Law on Renewable Energy Sources. 
Specifically, the decree stipulates that only renewable energy generation suppliers that 
use new equipment are permitted to partake in tenders under the quota allocations 
and that the FiTs at which they sell their electricity to the off-taker are set for a ten-year 
period. The off-taker is the Oblenergo in the region where the renewable energy plant is 
located. The FiT is calculated by the application of a multiplying coefficient to the market 
electricity price. The market price is calculated as follows: market price = base price * 
(0.31 + 0.69 C/Ca), whereby C is the exchange rate of BYR against the USD at the time of 
payment and Ca is the exchange rate at the time when the base price was approved. This 
is used to adjust the rates of inflation and index the tariff to the USD. The FiT coefficient 
is dependent on the type of renewable energy, installed capacity and/or lifespan of the 
installation, as shown in Table 7.

Source: Ministry of Energy (2020a)The presidential decree also obligates renewable energy generators to produce only 
according to schedules set by the dispatch control centre to offset potential instability 
on the grid system.
According to the tax code of the Republic of Belarus, renewable energy equipment, 
components and spare parts for renewable energy generation are exempted from
VAT upon import and may further be exempted from custom duties. Land tax is also 
waived for renewable energy facilities and plants. Furthermore, to promote electric 
mobility uptake, VAT for electric vehicle imports is waived. If the vehicles are purchased 
inland, the buyer is eligible for a VAT rebate. Further incentives for electric car owners 
include free public parking and free public road usage tax (Export.by, 2020).

Credit provided by Belarusian banks for the distribution of energy, gas, steam and warm 
water amounted to 6% of total credit disbursed in 2016, and their involvement remains 
limited. Commercial bank lending in Belarus, in local currency, is done at relatively high 
interest rates of 9.023% (in 2019), and loan tenures are rather short (Trading Economics, 
2020). Local green financing is almost negligible, so most investments are supported by 
IFIs or through credit lines provided by international development partners to the local 
banking sector. 
IFIs–such as the World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), 
the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation (NEFCO) and the Eurasian Development 
Bank (EDB) – have been active in Belarus by offering concessional loans at attractive 
interest rates, partial grant schemes and technical assistance for local banks. However, 
for public projects, IFIs almost always require a sovereign loan guarantee because they 
perceive public institutions, such as municipalities and state-owned enterprises, to have 
low credit-worthiness. Table 8 highlights some of the available financing opportunities 
for the renewable energy sector.
The Republic of Belarus co-operates with various international organisations for the 
development of the energy sector.
The EBRD co-operates with Belarus on the development of renewable energy and 
energy efficiency through programmes such as the Finance and Technology Transfer 
Centre for Climate Change, known as FINTECC. The programme offers investment, policy 
and technical support to a number of countries, including Belarus. Furthermore, EBRD 
has supported Belarus with over USD 500 million in funding for the implementation 
of energy efficiency investment projects. In renewable energy, the bank provided 
a senior loan of USD 18.4 million (of the USD 26.3 million total project cost) for the 
development of three biogas power plants with a total installed capacity of 15 MW.

generated electricity to the regional subsidiaries of the state-owned utility company 
BelEnergo (EBRD, 2020a). EBRD is also assisting BelEnergo’s subsidiary MinskEnergo 
in developing electricity infrastructure that will connect to the Minsk Free Economic 
Zone (FEZ Minsk). Specifically, the bank is providing a sovereign loan of EUR 14.5 million 
(euros) (USD 17.4 million) for the construction of a 110/10 kV low voltage substation in 
the town of Fanipol (EBRD, 2020b). Furthermore, the cities of Minsk and Pinsk are both 
members of EBRD’s Green Cities Initiative supporting the preparation of the Green City 
Action Plan. The plan identifies investment needs and provides technical support to city 
administrators and local stakeholders in sectors including waste and water management, 
urban transportation, energy, and green buildings (EBRD, 2020c). Through its BelSEFF, 
EBRD supports projects in energy efficiency and small-scale renewable energy by 
working with local financial institutions to on-lend the funds to small and mediumsized businesses, corporate and residential borrowers, and renewable energy project 
developers. BelSEFF has financed energy-efficient heating technologies in the Minsk 
region and a 1.78 MW solar PV plant in the Mogilev region (EBRD SEFF, 2020).
The World Bank, through its lending arm, the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, supports Belarus on the Sustainable Energy Scale-Up Project (2020-2025) 
with a total project cost of USD 202.25 million. The borrower is the State Committee for 
Standardisation and the implementing agencies are the Energy Efficiency Department 
and Belinvestenergosberezhenie (authorised agency for the implementation of energy 
conservation projects financed by loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development). The project aims to scale up the efficient use of energy in space 
heating of multi-apartment buildings and in woody biomass utilisation for heating in 
selected localities. The components of the project include (World Bank, 2020b):
• renewable wood biomass heating to support fuel switching to renewable biomass 
and efficiency improvement of heating systems through biomass heating investments
• thermal renovation of multi-apartment buildings to support thermal renovation by 
piloting a partially payable grant scheme selected by the government and the bank 
• technical assistance to the thermal renovation pilot and the thermal renovation 
programme, as well as for overall project implementation support.
Furthermore, the World Bank committed USD 90 million to support the Belarus Biomass 
District Heating Project between 2014 and 2021. The project’s objectives are to expand 
the efficient utilisation of biomass in heat and electricity supply in selected towns of 
Belarus (World Bank, 2020c).
Through the IFC, the World Bank further invested USD 850 million for private sector 
development and provides concessional loans to SMEs in the energy sector. It also 
provides investment advice to the government to support the inflow of foreign capital 
and increased private sector engagement. Specifically, between 2019 and 2022, the IFC 
has committed to working on capacity building activities for promoting investment with 
MART, supporting SMEs through the development of conducive regulatory frameworks 
with the Ministry of Economy and improved access to finance with the National Bank of 
Belarus, and enhancing accreditation systems in Belarus with Gosstandart (Ministry of 
Economy, 2020b).The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Global Environment Facility, 
in co-operation with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection of 
Belarus, launched the Removing Barriers to Wind Power Development in Belarus project 
in 2015. The objectives of this project, budgeted at USD 3.345 million, are to assist in 
the development of the wind power sector and enable investment for the construction 
of five wind farms with a total installed capacity of 60.7 MW. The project has carried 
out two year wind speed measurements and detailed feasibility studies. It also assisted 
in obtaining various permits that saw the commissioning of 9 MW of wind power in the 
small town of Novogrudok as well as other planned wind power plants in the rest of the 
country (UNDP, 2019). Belarus has also been working closely with the United Nations 
to develop the next United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 
for 2021-2025 (UNSDG, 2020). The draft National Sustainability Strategy 2035 was also 
developed with expert support of the United Nations entities in Belarus.
The EDB, as the regional financial institution established to promote economic growth 
in its member states by extending trade, economic and investment ties among them, 
has supported Belarus by financing the construction of a 21.75 MW hydropower plant at 
Polotsk on the western Dvina River. The plant was commissioned in 2017 and is operated 
by BelEnergo’s subsidiary Vitebskenergo. The total project costs were USD 79.97 million 
(EDB, 2019).
NEFCO is an IFI established in 1990 through an intergovernmental treaty between 
sovereign states, the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and 
Sweden. NEFCO exclusively finances small and medium-size environmental and climaterelated projects. As an example, NEFCO along with Swedfund provided a EUR 1.2 million 
(USD 1.44 million) loan for a landfill gas-to-electricity project in Vitebsk that is privately 
owned by Vireo Energy (NEFCO, 2019). NEFCO further supports the Belarusian People’s 
Bank with a EUR 1 million (USD 1.2 million) credit line for electric vehicle loans and loans 
for charging stations (EMEurope, 2019).4.1 FALLING COSTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES
Over the past two decades, global renewable power generation capacity has drastically 
increased, from 754 GW in 2000 to 2 799 GW in 2020. In fact, in 2020, renewables 
accounted for a record share (82%) of all new power generation capacities. In view of the 
COVID-19 global pandemic and the consequent adverse economic effects, it is clear that 
global renewable energy supply chains proved to be resilient and adaptable in dire crises. 
The increasing pace of renewable power capacity additions was facilitated by falling 
renewable energy technology costs due to technological advancements, economies of 
scale and competitive supply chains. In the past decade (i.e., between 2010 and 2020), the 
costs of power production from utility-scale solar PV, concentrated solar power and onshore 
wind have decreased by 85%, 68% and 56%, respectively. A shown in Figure 24, the global 
weighted-average levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of solar PV fell from USD 0.381/kWh
in 2010 to USD 0.057/kWh in 2020, and for onshore wind from USD 0.089/kWh in 2010 to 
USD 0.039/kWh in 2020. This not only indicates that renewables are able to compete with 
the cheapest fossil fuels, but that they are able to surpass them in terms of cost and new 
installed capacities. This trend is firmly expected to continue in the coming years. As an 
example, based on data from IRENA’s Renewable Auction and PPA Database, utility-scale 
solar PV projects that have won recent competitive procurement processes and that are 
expected to be commissioned by 2022 could have an average price of USD 0.04/kWh, 
which is 27% less than the cheapest fossil fuel competitor, namely coal-fired plants.

The Belarusian energy sector is heavily based on fossil fuels and highly dependent on energy 
imports. The current energy demand is insufficiently met by locally available resources and, 
as a result, the energy sector relies to a great extent on imports of oil and gas. With energy 
imports amounting to 84.8% of the TPES, Belarus is one of the world’s most energy importdependent countries. The highest fuel import dependency is on natural gas, of which only 
2% of demand is produced domestically. Furthermore, most of the energy imports are from 
a single source supplier, which additionally jeopardises the country’s energy security.
Belarus imports most of its energy from the Russian Federation. Traditionally, such 
imports of natural gas and oil from the Russian Federation have benefitted from 
favourable import prices that are only a fraction of the prices charged to other European 
countries. Nevertheless, because of Belarus’s overreliance on energy imports, high energy 
insecurity and extreme vulnerability to price changes, any increases in import prices 
have always been met with strong opposition. Figure 25 shows the strong fluctuations in 
import prices of fossil fuels between 2012 and 2019. 
Belarus has set forth various targets to increase its energy sector security. These have 
been outlined in the main energy policy document on the Concept of Energy Security up 
to 2035 and include increasing the share of domestic energy production in gross energy 
consumption, decreasing dependence on energy imports, diversifying energy resources, 
diversifying import energy suppliers and reducing the share of the major energy supplier 
in total energy imports. Accelerating the deployment of renewable energy is therefore 
critical in meeting these targets. Renewable energy resources, although currently 
untapped, are abundantly available in Belarus and present a way for the energy system 
to reduce its import dependence, alleviate vulnerability of energy import prices and 
promote domestic energy production, thereby improving the country’s energy sector 
security. This in turn would lead to an economically sustainable and environmentally 
sound energy sector.

Source: Adapted from BELSTAT (2020c)4.3 CONTRIBUTION TO ECONOMIC GROWTH
Belarus relies heavily on energy imports to meet its national energy demand. In 2019, 
gross energy imports amounted to USD 9.9 billion while the net energy import balance 
was USD 3.6 billion (BELSTAT, 2020c). In relative terms, the net energy import balance 
equates to approximately 5.5% of the country’s GDP, contributing significantly to the 
country’s trade deficit. Also, given this high reliance on energy imports and the fact 
that the primary energy supply is not predominately domestically sourced, the energy 
sector is not a significant direct contributor to the country’s GDP. In fact, the supply12
of electricity, gas, steam and hot water contributes to only 3% of the national GDP
(BYR 3.95 billion, USD 1.9 billion) (BELSTAT, 2020d). 
Therefore, the exploitation of local energy sources is crucial to enable the country to 
reduce its trade deficit and its expenditures on energy imports. In this regard, renewable 
energy deployment presents one of the most viable options, given the country’s abundant 
and diverse renewable energy resource potential. Moreover, apart from renewable 
energy resources, Belarus does not have other significant energy resources. By boosting 
the deployment of renewable energy technologies, Belarus would be able to increase its 
domestic energy supply, which would have a direct contribution towards the country’s 
GDP while also advancing towards sustainable and environmentally sound economic 
growth in the country. To facilitate the technical and economic viability of renewable 
energy deployment across all economic sectors, energy efficiency measures must also 
be enforced. In consequence this will contribute to the country’s national development 
targets of reducing the energy intensity13 of the economy.
4.4 REDUCTION OF GHG EMISSIONS
In Belarus, energy utilisation alone is responsible for about two-thirds of the country’s 
current greenhouse gas emissions, which is similar to the global average. To achieve the 
GHG emission goals set out in the Paris Agreement, the transformation of the energy 
system is of vital importance. At the same time, economic growth and energy security 
need to be maintained while achieving these goals. For the first time in decades, in 
2014 and for the next three-year period, energy-related global GHG emissions stabilised 
despite continued economic growth (IEA, 2020b) due to the decreasing dependence 
of economic growth on GHG-emitting energy sources and a decrease in the energy 
intensity of the global economy. This was facilitated by the increased deployment of 
renewable energy technologies and increased energy efficiency measures. In Belarus, 
GHG emission stabilisation has been observed since 2005. This is attributed mainly to 
the restructuring of the economy over the past few decades and the fact that energy 
efficiency measures have steadily been introduced across all economic sectors. 
12 Supply refers to all domestically produced electricity, gas, steam and hot water, and domestically provided services such as 
distribution, transmission and sale of the same.
13 The energy intensity of the economy is the ratio between gross inland energy consumption and GDP. It is a measure of the energy 
efficiency of an economy. The more energy intense an economy is, the more energy it takes to produce the same unit of GDP and
the less the net value added of the service or good that is contributing to the GDP.Under a business-as-usual scenario,14 Belaruss energy demand is projected to increase 
some 42% by 2050 from its 2018 level. However, realising the need to reduce the energy 
intensity of its economy, the country has committed to continually enforcing energy 
efficiency measures. In fact, with ambitious renewable energy and energy efficiency 
targets, the energy demand of Belarus could potentially fall well below its 2018 levels by 
205015 (Simon et al., 2019). This means that any further deployment of renewable energy 
will be able to directly displace current fossil fuel utilisation and directly contribute 
towards GHG abatement.
4.5 LOCAL VALUE CHAIN CREATION
The development of the renewable energy sector presents opportunities for developing 
domestic industries, creating jobs along the value chain, generating income and 
harnessing wider socio-economic benefits. To maximise these benefits and contribute to 
local value chain creation through renewables, a country needs to leverage its existing 
economic activities, or develop new ones, and build on its local supply chains. 
Local industrial development in Belarus can be enhanced by leveraging local 
materials and industries. These include glass, steel, concrete and aluminium for solar 
PV development, as well as concrete, steel, polymers and fibreglass for wind project 
development. Furthermore, renewable energy development can boost economic 
activities along the various renewable energy value chain segments, which include project 
planning, procurement of raw materials and components, component manufacturing, 
transport, installation, grid connection, commissioning, operation and maintenance, and 
decommissioning. 
According to IRENA’s analysis, the development of a typical 50 MW solar PV plant requires 
approximately 230000 person days along the value chain (IRENA, 2017a). Figure 26 
shows the distribution of human resources required along the value chain. Although 
various segments of the value chain, such as manufacturing, are concentrated in only 
a few countries, much of the value chain – such as transport and construction – can 
immediately be facilitated by the domestic workforce of existing industries within the 
country. Installation and grid connection segments involve the most labour-intensive 
activities, such as site preparation and civil works, which can also easily be sourced 
locally and have the potential to create local employment opportunities, especially for 
low- to medium-skilled workers (IRENA, 2017b). Furthermore, by building a certified and 
skilled workforce in other value chain segments – such as installation, operation and 
maintenance – over 70% of the value chain requirements can be sourced locally, creating 
significant socio-economic benefits.

In 2017, IRENA published two reports, Renewable energy benefits: Leveraging local capacity for 
onshore wind, and Renewable energy benefits: Leveraging local capacity for solar PV. To harness 
the potential for local value creation, the reports assess the types of jobs that can be created along 
the value chain of the two technologies and aims to inform policy makers on the human resources and 
skills required to produce, install and decommission renewable energy plants. The reports assess the 
materials and equipment needed in each segment of the value chain and identify ways to leverage 
existing local industries (IRENA, 2017b) (IRENA, 2017c).5.1 POLICY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS
Scaling up the deployment of renewables requires ambitious supporting policies and 
conducive regulatory frameworks. Although Belarus has over the years put in place 
various frameworks and incentives for the development of renewables, they are still in an 
early stage, and the pace of their deployment has not taken advantage of the abundance 
of their resource potential. Some of the policy and regulatory reasons for this slow uptake 
have included unambitious and incoherent renewable energy targets. Furthermore, the 
deployment of renewables in power generation has been facilitated through yearly quota 
allocations that have been prone to revisions, reductions and low pricing of FiTs, which 
have consequently deterred investments. To allow for a more conducive environment 
for renewable energy deployment, recommended actions include increasing the 
ambitiousness of renewable energy targets, improving the quota allocations and their 
pricing methodology, as well as introducing renewable energy auctions for pricing that 
is more market-based, especially for large-scale investments.
Action 1: Revising renewable energy targets
Renewable energy targets can be drivers for multiple interconnected policy objectives 
that lead to the development of the country’s energy sector and its further development. 
Targets facilitate transparency in policy development, provide signals for investors 
regarding investment opportunities in the short- and long-term, and indicate any data 
or methodology discrepancies that need improvement as the sector develops. They also 
provide an indication of the government’s commitment to energy security, environmental 
sustainability and overall socio-economic development. 
For the development of renewables in Belarus, various renewable energy targets have 
been set through multiple policy frameworks. These frameworks have sometimes lacked 
coherence or have been misaligned, and some have only been partially achieved. As 
discussed in Chapter 2, Section 6, the State Programme for Energy Saving to 2020 set 
various technology-specific renewable energy targets that were not met by the end 
of 2020. On the other hand, however, the overall renewable energy target by 2020
(i.e., 6% renewable energy production of TPES) was achieved, as set out in the 
main policy document of the Concept of Energy Security of the Republic of 
Belarus. In fact, even the renewable energy target for 2025 laid out in the same 
document was achieved in 2020 (i.e., 7% renewable energy production of TPES).
5 CHALLENGES AND
RECOMMENDATIONSRenewable energy targets can facilitate transparency
in policy development, provide signals for investors
regarding investment opportunities in the shortand long-term 
The fact that the target was achieved five years in advance presents uncertainty about 
the impetus for continued renewable energy development in the near-term. It also brings 
into question the ambitiousness of the targets and their relation to other development 
objectives, given that a 14% renewable energy share of the TPES was set as an acceptable 
level of energy security.
Although current targets as laid out in the Concept of Energy Security have encouraged 
the development of renewables thus far, it is recommended that these targets now 
be revised, streamlined and increased in ambition and coherence. These actions will 
allow the energy sector to transition from its current early stage of renewable energy 
development and to continue to build momentum while working towards overall 
development objectives. 
As a first step, it is suggested that the current renewable energy target set out in the 
Concept of Energy Security be revised and aligned with the target set in the most 
recently adopted State Programme for Energy Saving 2021-2025 (i.e., 8% share of 
renewable energy production of the TPES by 2025), which would incentivise the 
continued development of renewables in the near-term. Furthermore, renewable energy 
targets in end uses, such as electricity, heat and transport, need to be clearly defined and 
should be consistent with all energy sector development objectives, such as increased 
energy security and gas share reduction. In this case, it is necessary to harmonise targets 
with indicators adopted by the Republic of Belarus within the framework of the Paris 
Agreement on climate and with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Target setting needs to be founded on metrics and clearly articulated objectives, while 
also taking into consideration political, institutional and economic aspects. They can 
be set in absolute terms (i.e., a specific quantity of energy to be supplied or capacity 
to be installed) or relative to a moving baseline (i.e., generation output as a share of 
final energy supply in percentage terms). Absolute targets for technology-specific 
installed capacities may have the advantage of easier monitoring, but they do run 
the risk of counting idle or under-performing capacities towards the capacity target 
when in reality they do not actually contribute significantly towards energy supply. It is 
therefore recommended that both absolute and relative targets be combined to allow 
for monitoring of renewable energy development in terms of output and capacity. This 
can better facilitate the implementation of such targets and relate them to specific policy 
measures such as quota allocations, FiTs and auctions. Furthermore, technology-specific 
targets should not be considered to be a cap on installed capacities and should be 
regularly reviewed and revised in case one renewable energy technology proves more 
economically viable than another. Targets also need to be enacted by law, with clear 
compliance and enforcement mechanisms. This reduces the market risk for investors 
and clearly signals the country’s commitment to renewable energy development
(IRENA, 2015). Action 2: Improving the quota allocation for renewables
The development of renewables in the Belarusian power sector is enabled through 
yearly quotas that allocate the amounts of installed capacities per renewable energy 
technology. The quotas are allocated for the coming three-year period, but they have 
been subject to many revisions, a circumstance that has adversely impacted investor 
confidence. In 2015, the Resolution of the Council of Ministers on the Establishment, 
Distribution, Release and Withdrawal of Quotas for the Creation of Installations for the 
Use of Renewable Energy Sources No. 662 was passed, which regulates the setting of 
quotas for various renewable generation capacities (Council of Ministers of the Republic 
of Belarus, 2018). In 2017, however, a revised Resolution of the Council of Ministers 
No. 305 was passed that revised the procedure for determining and allocating energy 
generation quotas, ultimately decreasing the quota amounts to slow the initial influx of 
variable renewable power. This limits the pace of the renewable energy sector’s growth. 
For example, in the period 2017-2019, applications received amounted to 770 MW of 
installed power capacity, whereas the allocated quotas for the same period were seven 
times less (117.42 MW) (Simon et al., 2019). 
Moreover, the quotas allocated to investors for the current three-year period 2021-2023 
have been revised downward twice and have amount to only 38.8 MW out of the total 
129.5 MW allocated for the same period. This amounts to approximately a third of the 
quota allocation and is considered by stakeholders to be unambitious. The revision 
annulled the previously allocated quotas for geothermal and waste-to-energy for the 
three-year period and reduced the total 2023 quota for all technologies from the previous 
allocation of 102.16 MW to 18.3 MW. In addition, the quota allocations do not encourage 
larger-scale investments, which tend to be cheaper. For example, the allocated solar PV 
quota for 2021 is only 2.5 MW, whereas the quotas for both solar PV and wind in 2023 are 
set to 9 MW each, and no quotas have been allocated for biomass in 2022. 
The methodology for quota allocations has been described by national energy
stakeholders as being insufficiently transparent, not facilitating wider stakeholder 
engagement, and allowing various revisions without justification. Furthermore, the 
FiT incentives (i.e., the multiplier coefficients applied to the base price determining 
the FiT price for renewable energy technology) allocated under the quota system are 
not attractive for investors. This is apparent in the number of previously concluded 
investment agreements that have been terminated, especially in the construction of 
biomass/biogas power plants.
To address these challenges and accelerate the development of renewables, it is 
imperative that the allocated quota amounts be increased and that the multiplier 
coefficients be appropriately determined for each technology to ensure economic 
viability for investors, especially for solar PV, biomass and wind technologies. Through 
the RRA stakeholder consultation process, stakeholders have asserted that given the 
country’s limited hydropower resources, quotas should not be allocated to hydropower 
but should instead focus on solar PV, biomass and wind power development. In addition, 
recommendations were made that renewable energy prosumers16 should not be included 
in the quota system because their power production would have limited consequences 
for the power grid. Furthermore, some stakeholders in Belarus believe that the quota 
allocation period should also be extended from the current three years to five years to 
allow investors to gauge the development of the sector. 
16 Energy prosumers are both producers and consumers of energy.In these efforts to improve quota allocations, extensive energy stakeholder engagement 
(including representation from the Renewable Energy Association) is crucial to ensure 
transparency in the process. Multi-stakeholder engagement during the revision stages 
would allow for a more varied and objective consideration in setting the optimal quota 
allocations per technology. Such considerations should include, among others, investor 
readiness, which calls for increased quota allocations, as well as technical bottlenecks, 
which call for more controlled increments. 
Action 3: Designing renewable energy auctions
Renewable energy producers in Belarus sell their electricity to the off-taker, the respective 
regional subsidiary of the state-owned BelEnergo, at a FiT set out by MART. As discussed in 
Chapter 3, Section 2, the FiTs per technology are calculated by applying different multiplier 
coefficients on the electricity base tariffs. Given that FiT calculations are based on electricity 
tariffs that do not truly reflect the unit cost of production, and further compounded by the 
fact that the multiplier coefficients are low, stakeholders report that the FiTs in turn are too 
low to attract the necessary investments at scale. More specifically, the FiTs are considered 
particularly low for wind and solar PV technologies, whose multiplier coefficients are on par 
with otherwise cheaper technologies, such as hydropower. Furthermore, the methodology 
for setting the multiplier coefficients lacks transparency, and it is unclear why some 
multiplier coefficients are differentiated by lifetime of the project, as is the case for wind, 
while others are differentiated by capacity size. 
To attract renewable energy investments, especially at a larger scale, it is recommended 
that the country look into developing renewable energy auctions that can allow for 
market-based tariff setting of renewable power generation and the potential for real 
price discovery. Auctions are one of the most successful policy support mechanisms for 
the development of renewables globally, specifically for utility-scale renewable energy 
plants. They allow for well-planned and cost-efficient renewable energy deployment, 
and their transparent design and implementation can instil confidence in investors and 
reduce the perceived market risks. A key strength of auctions is their ability to determine 
the real market tariff for renewable power generation in a structured, transparent 
and competitive process, while considering the development and maturity of national 
markets and the development of local supply chains. Furthermore, auctions can facilitate 
contractual agreements between the power producer and the off-taker that clearly lay 
out the commitments and liabilities of the two parties, and in turn offer more regulatory 
certainty. Nevertheless, the eventual success of auctions relies on eliminating any 
potential for bidder collusion and ensuring fair competition while offering terms that can 
attract a critical number of bidders.In 2013, Kazakhstan set an ambitious target of generating 50% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 
2050. FiTs were introduced in 2014 to attract renewable energy investments, and although they did initially boost 
renewable energy deployment, the FiTs did not capture the rapidly falling costs of solar PV and wind technologies. 
This led the country to design renewable energy auctions that would allow for more competitive price setting and 
increased transparency of energy procurement. In 2018, the first auction bidding round was announced, along 
with guidelines on eligible renewable energy technologies, project capacity limits for bidders, dedicated land plots 
for project development, assigned grid connection points and ceiling prices equivalent to FiT prices from 2014. 
At the same time, the country also announced its planned auction schedules going forward, which encouraged a 
pipeline of renewable energy projects in the subsequent auction rounds. In only two years since the auction launch, 
Kazakhstan has completed 28 auctions with a contracted capacity of 1.07 GW, of which 609 MW is wind, 356 MW is 
solar PV, and the remainder are hydro and biomass power plants. Furthermore, in the same time period, the auction 
bids were at least 15% and as much as 66% lower that the previously set FiT prices, depending on technology 
(USAID, 2020). The design of the auctions in Kazakhstan was supported by IRENA. 
Box 1 Successful auction design: The case of Kazakhstan
IRENA has served as a global reference for renewable 
energy auctions since 2012, when the agency 
produced its first study on auctions, Renewable 
energy auctions in developing countries. In 2015, 
IRENA, together with the Clean Energy Ministerial, 
developed a six-volume guidebook on the design of 
auctions, Renewable energy auctions: A guide to 
design, which has advised policy makers on various 
approaches to auction design and their implications. 
The report highlights key auction design elements 
and offers choices and recommendations to support 
optimal decision-making in different contexts with 
a view to ensuring cost-effectiveness, security of 
energy supply and socio-economic development 
objectives (IRENA and CEM, 2015). This guidebook 
has been used by several governments and 
development banks, such as EBRD, the World Bank and the United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID), to support countries in designing their auctions. Since then, IRENA has 
published three reports on the topic. The latest, Renewable energy auctions: Status and trends 
beyond price (2019), demonstrates how auctions can be designed to support other objectives. 
Building on this knowledge, IRENA supports countries with the design and implementation of 
renewable energy auctions according to specific country circumstances and broader objectives and 
provides capacity-building workshops and more tailored advice upon request.5.2 RENEWABLES IN END USES
Heat accounts for the largest share (30%) of final energy consumption in Belarus, 
and given that it is overwhelmingly fossil-fuelled, its decarbonisation is imperative for 
ensuring a sustainable and energy-secure development future for Belarus. Currently, the 
heat sector does not have a dedicated law governing its development, decarbonisation 
and subsidisation. This has subsequently led to the slow uptake of renewables in 
heating and an over-subsidisation of the otherwise fossil-fuelled sector. Although the 
country plans for more integration of biomass in heating, sustainable biomass resource 
potentials are insufficiently assessed, and the methodologies for the estimation 
of their energy content are outdated. Furthermore, alternative renewable energy 
technologies – such as geothermal and solar thermal, which would allow for a more 
diversified and decarbonised heat supply – are insufficiently accounted for in planning, 
despite their potential. It is therefore recommended that a law governing the broader 
energy sector, and heat supply specifically, be developed that would make provisions 
for decarbonisation and appropriately allocated subsidies that are more conducive to 
renewables. Finally, the development of heat supply in Belarus should be diversified 
and based on the integration of modern, technically and economically feasible energyefficient technologies harnessing the country’s renewable energy potential.
Action 4: Developing a law on energy and heat
As discussed in Chapter 2, Section 6, Belarus has enacted several laws and legal acts 
governing the country’s energy sector. Nevertheless, there is no primary act or base 
law on energy that holistically governs the energy sector, defining the energy system 
and the roles of the different energy sector entities, including suppliers, consumers 
and prosumers and their operational obligations, reporting and deliverables, and the 
appointment of monitoring and enforcement agencies. To compensate for the lack of 
a state-wide law on energy, local regulations ultimately fill this gap and tend to leave 
room for inconsistency among different regions. A telling example is that Belarus does 
not have a specific law governing this end use sector. As such, there is no comprehensive 
legal framework to incentivise the development of renewable energy in heating and 
support its decarbonisation.
Heat accounts for the largest share (30%) of final energy consumption in Belarus, but 
only 10.6% of heat production comes from renewable energy sources – mainly biomass. 
Furthermore, there are no specific renewable energy targets for the heating supply 
except for targets to reduce the gas share in the heat supply, as defined in the Concept 
for Energy Security (see Chapter 2, Section 6) and technology-specific targets for the 
development of biomass and heat pumps for heating, as defined in the State Programme 
on Energy Saving. Solar thermal and geothermal technologies remain unexploited 
despite the country’s potential to harness such renewable energy sources for heating and 
hot water supply and thereby effectively reduce the sector’s overreliance on imported 
natural gas. 
The increased uptake of renewables in heating is further hindered by a lack of costcompetitiveness compared to alternatives, such as relatively low-cost natural gas, and 
the high degree of subsidisation of end user heat tariffs, which is a measure to address 
energy poverty. According to energy stakeholders in the country, the methodology for 
setting consumer tariffs lacks full transparency and the base price for heat production 
does not reflect the true cost of heat production. The state spends up to an estimated USD 800 million annually to subsidise heat supply. 
Residential heat tariffs alone are estimated to be between 10% and 21%17 of the actual 
production cost (World Bank, 2014). Given the high degree of subsidisation, it is increasingly 
difficult for renewable energy investments to compete. There is a need to shift these 
subsidies to more sustainable sources of energy to reduce the long-term cost of support 
while supporting the energy transition. A dedicated and comprehensive legal framework 
for the energy sector would be a starting point in addressing this challenge and assigning 
legal enforcement mechanisms for the development of various energy sector programmes. 
Furthermore, a dedicated heat law and accompanying bylaws could incentivise the 
development of renewables (including geothermal, solar thermal and modern biomass) in 
heat supply and would signal the political commitment to the decarbonisation of the sector. 
Policies to phase out fossil fuels, eliminate distortions and incentivise energy transition 
solutions are described in detail in the joint IRENA, IEA and REN21 report Renewable 
energy policies in a time of transition: Heating and cooling (IRENA, IEA and REN21, 2020) 
and in IRENA’s World energy transition outlook (IRENA, 2021).
Action 5: Harnessing renewable energy potentials in heating
Belarus places great importance on the development of biomass for heating. It is endowed 
with great biomass potential, both from agricultural waste and vast expanses of forest 
cover, which can be used to increase the share of renewables in the heat supply – both 
for space and water heating. However, despite the high potential, securing good 
quality and continuous biomass feedstock supply from sustainable sources is crucial 
to ensuring the technical viability and sustainability of projects. The country’s biomass 
supply is characterised by seasonal fluctuations in supply availability, which largely 
depends on the type of feedstock and can be offset with feedstock storage facilities 
and combinations with other feedstocks that offer seasonal complementarity. Biomass 
resource assessments in Belarus have been undertaken to various degrees. However, 
assessments of the calorific value of different feedstocks and fuel products need further 
improvement, especially because the country relies on resource assessment standards 
that are outdated and do not take into account different technological advancements for 
thermal extraction and processing of feedstocks into more calorie-dense fuel products. 
Furthermore, standardisation and costs accompanying logistical supply chains of 
feedstocks and fuels also require consideration. 
Biomass feedstocks must be available in reasonable quantities within an acceptable 
distance to make any investments economically viable because transportation costs 
factor significantly into the final unit price of the fuel. Currently, the unit price of biomass 
is based on mass or volume of the fuel, rather than per unit calorific value. This introduces 
discrepancies, especially as different qualities, chemical and physical characteristics of 
feedstock arise. For example, feedstocks that have low energy density and high moisture 
content present challenges for storage and transportation and may not be technically viable 
unless pretreated through drying and densification, which in turn affects its economics. 
Therefore, standardising the quality of biomass feedstocks and ensuring trading prices 
based on such quality standards, such as per unit energy density, is necessary to ensure 
the technical and economic viability of biomass for heating. Furthermore, innovative 
technologies for biomass and waste-to-energy require development, demonstration and 
evaluation of economic efficiency, especially for district heat supply. 
17 Depending on the size, condition and fuel used in the district heating system.The implementation of a holistic master plan in
Belarus is imperative to achieve a higher share
of renewables in the energy sector 
The development of bioenergy also needs to be sustainable. Relevant aspects of 
sustainability include biodiversity and ecosystem benefits (including flood mitigation, 
water and soil quality) and impacts (on biodiversity and land and water use), as well as 
social issues such as food security, impacts on gender and job creation. Belarus already 
has vast areas of disturbed peatland forests (UNDP, 2018), and further damage must be 
avoided. It is important to recognise the significant risks related to negative impacts, both 
on the climate and in terms of wider sustainability, and to introduce measures to mitigate 
them. Such measures, and broader policies to support the deployment of bioenergy, are 
presented in IRENA’s report Recycle: Bioenergy (IRENA, 2020).
Geothermal energy is another option for decarbonising heat supply. The resource 
assessment of the potential of geothermal energy has only been carried out in a small 
number of sites, mainly in the south of the country. Further resource assessments need 
to be undertaken to more concretely estimate the enthalpy of geothermal potential in 
Belarus and how it can most efficiently be tapped and integrated into heat networks. 
Furthermore, the most appropriate technology application for harnessing geothermal 
energy in district and individual heating systems requires greater research. 
The increased use of renewable energy sources in heating should be based on the 
integration of modern, technically and economically feasible energy-efficient technologies 
harnessing the country’s biomass, low-enthalpy geothermal and solar thermal resources, 
as well as energy-efficient heat pumps. To advance renewable energy use in the heat 
supply, the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus should be supported in its efforts to 
fully develop and implement resource assessments and demonstrate the technical and 
economic feasibility of pilot projects.
5.3 PLANNING AND INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLES
The integration of renewables can present various challenges for an energy system 
which, if not appropriately accounted for, can deter their wider development. Adequate 
planning is required to align different cross-sector development objectives, and 
in Belarus, the implementation of a holistic master plan for the energy sector with a 
higher share of renewables is imperative. Specifically in the power sector, renewable 
integration at a larger scale is hampered by the lack of adequate grid codes that provide 
technical guidelines for the connection and operation of renewable power generation 
facilities and a lack of short-term variable renewable generation forecasting, which 
has resulted in power system operations that are non-conducive to wider renewable 
energy deployment. To address these challenges and facilitate the wider integration of 
renewables, it is recommended that an energy sector master plan with higher shares 
of renewables be developed, along with grid codes and improved variable renewable 
energy forecasting in power system operations.Action 6: Developing an energy sector master plan with higher shares of renewables
The development of the energy sector in Belarus is guided by a number of state 
programmes such as the Concept of Energy Security by 2023, State Programme for 
Energy Saving by 2025, Comprehensive Plan for the Development of the Electric Power 
Industry until 2025 and the Programme for the Development of Charging Infrastructure 
and Electric Transport by 2025. However, to foster an effective integration of renewables 
and ensure coherence among the various sub-sector programmes and the feasibility of 
attaining each programme’s objectives, it is necessary to integrate these cross-sector 
strategies into a master plan for an integrated development of the energy sector. 
For example, the State Programme on Energy Saving plans for an increased electrification 
of heat supply in Belarus that has implications for the development of the power sector. 
The power sector would need to align its development objectives even more intensively 
towards renewables to make sure that electrification of heating, and even transport, 
does not call for increased fossil-fuelled power production. The power sector would 
need to reflect timely infrastructure deployment, regulatory frameworks and demandside management measures, among others, to align with the development objectives of 
heat supply and electric transport. 
Moreover, the decarbonisation of the energy sector requires a long-term vision 
incorporated into such coherent planning. This entails the determination of short, 
medium and long-term objectives and commitments that can also guide the timely 
implementation of all international commitments, national development objectives, 
reforms and infrastructural advancements, etc., that are related to the energy sector. 
In other words, in striving for an increased share of renewable energy, the master plan 
should also ensure its alignment with international commitments, such as the Paris 
Agreement on climate change, as well as overall national development objectives, such 
as acceptable levels of energy security.
The increased participation of renewables leverages broader energy sector objectives, 
existing infrastructure and operational complementarity with current technologies. 
While renewables present various integration challenges, a master plan would allow 
for a preview of such challenges and offer ways to address them and methods to 
leverage existing and planned infrastructure to facilitate larger shares of renewables. 
The development of such a plan, and the accompanying energy system modelling, would 
facilitate sector-wide policy assessments, environmental impacts, and infrastructural 
and financial needs of fulfilling wider development objectives. Furthermore, a master 
plan would allow for a more co-ordinated, coherent and holistic development approach 
to various renewable targets, quota allocations and auction rounds, as discussed
in Chapter 5, Section 1. 
Action 7: Adopting a grid code for renewables
The Belarus power system is in a relatively early stage of managing variable renewable 
power injection. The system has been built around thermal power production, which 
amounts to 98% of electricity supply, and BelEnergo has limited operational experience 
with renewable power plant connections, grid management and stability with higher 
shares of renewables. As a precautionary measure to avoid any disturbances on 
the grid, renewable power producers are not given priority dispatch, but instead 
have to feed in power generated according to dispatch control centre schedules.Furthermore, there is a lack of technical standards for the integration of variable 
renewable power to the grid and uncertainty about technical requirements that 
the developers need to abide by to connect and feed in to the grid. This introduces 
transmission or grid risks and significantly increases the cost of financing for renewables. 
A well-formulated national renewable energy grid code that outlines the procedures and 
technical requirements for variable renewable power producers feeding into the central 
grid will help to alleviate investment risk and allow for a level playing field for all power 
producers, while also maintaining power system stability.
Of immediate importance to Belarus are the development and adoption of connection and 
operation codes that would take into account different renewable energy technologies 
and different capacity sizes. Connection codes regulate the generator connection, and 
operating codes regulate operational security, planning and scheduling as well as load 
frequency and emergency procedures. Various aspects for consideration during grid 
code development include the size of the power system; the level of interconnection with 
other countries’ power grids; the voltage levels of connection whereby requirements for 
connecting to lower voltages differ from higher voltage levels; distribution and flexibility 
of load and generation, which is also dependant on the geographical locations of 
connection points; the characteristics of conventional generators, such as the combined 
cycle gas turbines and their operational flexibility; energy policy and planning; and current 
and planned grid operational practices (IRENA, 2016). It is also important that grid codes 
are regularly reviewed and updated to take into account policy changes, the experience 
gathered with the implementation of the grid code and planned development of the 
power grid system. Grid codes should anticipate the future of the system requirements 
and align with national energy development goals. Furthermore, the participation of 
various energy stakeholders, such as policy makers, system operators and power plant 
producers, in the revision of grid codes is crucial in ensuring that system security is not 
compromised and that the responsibilities are justly distributed among all actors.
In 2016, IRENA published Scaling up variable 
renewable power: The role of grid codes, which 
provides guidance to national stakeholders such 
as policy makers and system operators on how to 
develop and implement grid connection codes to 
enable a higher share of variable renewable power 
by considering different aspects of a country’s power 
system context. It also highlights specific examples of 
variable renewable energy grid code implementation 
from other countries (IRENA, 2016).Action 8: Improving variable renewable power generation forecasting
Variable renewable power (such as solar PV and wind) forecasting is an essential and 
cost-effective tool for managing the power system operations, balancing of power 
supply and maintaining grid stability in power grids to which variable renewable power 
generators are connected. It becomes an increasingly essential part of power system 
management as higher shares of renewables, i.e., above 5%, are integrated into the grid. 
Currently in Belarus, wind and solar PV forecasting is not optimally integrated into daily 
scheduling and dispatch operations for power system balancing. 
In Belarus, all renewable energy generators above 1 MW are obliged to participate in the 
day-ahead scheduling. However, given the variability of renewable power generation, 
short-term (zero to six hour) forecasting is crucial in predicting renewable energy 
production in the next few hours and down to the next few minutes. Specifically, when 
intra-day adjustments of forecasted renewable energy production are not accounted for, 
power production uncertainty is created, resulting in discrepancies between the actual 
variable renewable energy that could have been fed into the grid and the scheduling 
set out by the dispatch control centre. This leads to unnecessary power curtailments for 
which renewable power producers are not compensated and which adds to the power 
market risk for investors in Belarus. 
To alleviate this investment risk and facilitate the increased integration of renewable power 
plants as the sector develops, it is imperative that short-term forecasting be integrated into 
generation scheduling and dispatch operations. This will allow for reconfiguring peaking 
plant operations (such as gas turbines) to allow for more renewables power injection, 
which has a zero marginal cost of production, and offset the need for costly fossil fuel 
utilisation. Such short-term forecasts are based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) 
models of weather conditions at site locations of the renewable energy power plants. Such 
meteorological data is converted to power forecasts combining both physical and/or
statistical methods. An example of a physical method to predict wind power production 
is Preventio, developed by the University of Oldenburg in Germany, which uses current 
NWP data to calculate wind speeds at wind turbine hub heights and thereby forecast 
power production. An example of a statistical method is the Wind Power Prediction Tool, 
developed by the Technical University of Denmark, which perpetually calibrates various 
data flows, such as weather conditions and past power production patterns, and uses 
statistical methods to predict power production (Zieher, Lange and Focken, 2015). 
In 2020, IRENA published Innovation landscape 
brief: Advanced forecasting of variable renewable 
power generation, which provides an overview of 
advanced weather forecasting and its importance 
for variable renewable power integration into power 
systems. The publication discusses the importance 
of short and long-term weather forecasting for 
both renewable generators as well as power system 
operators and presents key requirements for the 
implementation of such forecasting, together with 
best-practice examples from different countries 
(IRENA, 2020b).5.4 RENEWABLE ENERGY FINANCING
Financing levels for renewable energy projects in Belarus is very low, and there is an 
overall shortage of both debt and equity financing. In particular, the local financial sector 
has an inadequate track record in green financing, and most investments have been 
facilitated through international capital. Furthermore, local financing is very costly, and 
commercial lending incurs high interest rates and demands high collateral requirements 
due to numerous perceived risks. Such risks include the non-standardisation of PPAs in 
Belarus and the fact that contracts are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and signed 
only after commissioning of power plants. This ultimately introduces significant risks for 
investors and jeopardises their ability to secure financing for projects in the first place. 
These and other risks can be alleviated through various policy and financial de-risking 
mechanisms, including the standardisation of PPAs, as discussed in the recommended 
action points below. 
Action 9: Improving de-risking mechanisms for renewable energy investments
The financial sector risk presents a challenge for equity financing of renewable energy 
investments in Belarus and significantly contributes to the high cost of equity financing. 
This is largely due to a lack of financial sector policy for investing in renewable energy 
infrastructure and a general non-prioritisation of green financing in the sector. It is 
further compounded by a lack of local financing products, including those from the 
national development bank, in supporting renewable energy developers to access 
various funding opportunities. Small-scale investors, such as individual residential 
units, also lack appropriate financing mechanisms. It is therefore recommended that 
clear financial sector policies for green financing be developed with the national 
development bank creating a dedicated green financing portfolio and taking the lead 
in local green financing efforts. These should also include small-scale financing, such 
as the inclusion of rooftop solar PV, heat pumps and electric vehicles under housing 
and vehicle loans with the appropriate tailoring of loan tenures. Other financial sector 
policies could also encourage green financing through obliging financial institutions 
to report on their green financing portfolios as part of corporate social responsibility 
measures. Furthermore, a dedicated renewable energy fund could be an effective way 
of providing public loans and de-risking mechanisms for renewable energy investments. 
Such a fund can be sustained by taxes on GHG emissions, waste water pollution and 
natural resource exploitation, for example. 
Currency risk also adversely impacts the cost of international debt and equity financing. 
The Belarusian ruble is prone to considerable fluctuations and has depreciated in the 
recent past compared to hard currencies such as the euro or the US dollar. Currently, 
FiTs are dependent on the base price of electricity, which in turn is correlated to the price 
of imported fossil fuels. As such, according to legislation, the local currency FiTs are 
partially indexed to the US dollar. However, this indexation has decreased in recent years, 
and there is much uncertainty about how the newly added nuclear energy production 
will impact the indexation because the base tariff for electricity will have less influence 
from imported fossil fuel prices. Moreover, there is currently no indexation of local 
currency FiTs with the euro, which adversely affects financing from European countries. 
To increase the bankability of renewable energy investments, it is recommended that 
fixed prices in PPAs (as recommended in Action 3) should be at least partially indexed to 
the euro to decrease currency risks, and this indexation should be enforced in legislation.Off-taker risk is also a contributor towards the high costs of financing. The off-taker, the 
state-owned BelEnergo, is not perceived to have a high degree of credit-worthiness. 
This is mainly due to a lack of transparency in its financial reporting and the country’s 
highly subsidised energy tariffs. This poses a risk that the off-taker may default or delay 
payments to the renewable energy developers. Clear clauses to mitigate this risk need to 
be part of a standardised PPA. Additionally, government-backed guarantees and letters 
of support with the PPA can alleviate the off-taker risk.
Risk associated with permitting procedures also poses a challenge for renewable 
energy investments. For example, the country has a well-developed atlas of solar PV 
and wind sites indicating high resource potential areas that are favourable for project 
development. However, there is limited access to grid data to discern the possibility of 
connecting eventual renewable power generation to the grid. Data on the status and 
utilisation of power grids are not holistically available, and it is not always apparent to 
potential developers whether they will eventually be able to connect to their power plants 
to the grid in a timely manner or obtain the necessary permits. Therefore, including 
available grid connection points in the renewable energy atlas would allow investors to 
better assess the technical and economic feasibility of project development and help in 
alleviating permitting risk. Furthermore, permitting procedures should be streamlined 
and consistent in each administrative region of the country.
IRENA publishes a series of reports on measures for risk mitigation and financing mechanisms for 
renewable energy projects.
IRENA started its analytical work on renewable energy finance and investment in 2016, when 
it launched the publication Unlocking renewable energy investment: The role of risk mitigation 
and structured finance. The report highlighted the need to scale up renewable energy investment, 
outlined the challenges of attracting private investment and proposed ways to overcome barriers. 
In January 2018, IRENA joined forces with the Climate Policy Initiative, a leading institution in the 
tracking and analysis of climate finance flows, and launched the joint report Global landscape of 
renewable energy finance 2018. The report looks at key global investment trends in 2013-2016 by 
region and sector, maps the roles of different financial instruments, and explores key differences 
between private and public actors. In January 2020, IRENA published three finance briefs looking at sovereign guarantees and other risk 
mitigation options (Renewable energy finance: Sovereign guarantees), providing recommendations 
to harness institutional investment for renewable energy projects (Renewable energy finance: 
Institutional capital) and highlighting the need for more green bonds to drive sustainable, climatesafe energy finance (Renewable energy finance: Green bonds).
Institutional investors – including pension funds, 
insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and 
other endowments and foundations – represent 
an enormous global capital pool that has yet to be 
harnessed for the energy transition. Mobilising 
institutional capital for the energy transition
considers ways to attract institutional investors into the 
sector on the necessary scale. Its recommendations 
are aimed at policy makers, public capital providers, 
capital market regulators and other stakeholders, 
including major institutional investors that could 
channel capital into renewables.
Action 10: Standardising PPAs
PPAs are legally binding long-term contracts signed between independent power 
producers (IPPs, the sellers of power generated) and the off-taker (the purchaser of the 
power). The contract defines the price at which power will be sold and includes various 
clauses that define the legal obligations of both contractual parties, thereby allocating 
risk accordingly. Well-formulated PPAs are a crucial link in securing project financing for 
renewable power developers and allow for ascertaining the bankability of a project and 
the various risks associated with the operation of the project during the lifetime of the 
contract. PPAs for different renewable energy technologies in Belarus are not standardised. The 
clauses within the contract are individually negotiated between the off-taker, Oblenergo, 
and the developer. Furthermore, PPAs are only signed once the renewable power plant 
has been built and commissioned, which introduces a significant risk for the developers, 
may jeopardise the bankability of their project and weakens their negotiating position. 
Moreover, not having a PPA in the development phase of the renewable power project 
adversely impacts the ability of the developer to obtain debt financing for the project in 
the first place.
Currently, the prices that are set out in the PPAs are not fixed. On the contrary, the 
FiT prices are susceptible to annual changes depending on the changes in the base 
tariff for electricity production, which is largely based on the costs of the natural gas 
imports (see Chapter 3, Section 2 on FiT-setting methodology). Therefore, fluctuations in 
natural gas prices indirectly cause fluctuations in the FiT, which can significantly impact 
the economic viability of the project and increase the power market risk for investors.
A further challenge affecting the economic viability of renewable energy projects is the 
dispatch scheduling, which can lead to unnecessary power curtailments for the IPPs and 
for which they are currently not compensated.
As the country looks towards attracting more renewable energy investments, 
standardised PPAs for different renewable energy technologies need to be developed 
and applied in all regions of the country. PPAs should be concluded with the developers 
after successful bidding, and well before the commissioning of the power plants to 
facilitate financing. Throughout the duration of the contract, a guaranteed fixed price for 
the sale of electricity needs to be applied to alleviate the power market risk. Fixed prices 
can be set through eventual auction bidding rounds as recommended in Chapter 5, 
Section 1, Action 3. Furthermore, the contracts should include clauses that clearly 
define non-compensable and compensable power curtailments. For example, a noncompensable curtailment may occur in the event that power cannot be dispatched due 
to grid maintenance, in which case the IPP would not be compensated for the deemed18
energy generated. On the other hand, compensable curtailment may occur in the event 
that the off-taker cannot accept power due to balancing issues, in which case the IPP 
would be compensated for the deemed generation. The compensable curtailment – the
so-called “take-or-pay” mechanism – is essential in creating certainty of the project 
revenue stream for the developer, especially in cases of power curtailments that 
are beyond the control of the power producer. There could also be a limit to noncompensable power curtailments, and/or the PPA may makes provisions for extensions 
of the duration of the agreement to allow for recovery of missed energy production. 
Further clauses that need to be included in the standardised PPAs should obligate 
power producers to maintain minimum thresholds of guaranteed availability in the case 
of wind power (usually set at 95% of mechanical availability) and minimum thresholds 
of committed power generation in the case of solar PV (usually set at 85% of committed 
energy supply). 
18 Deemed generation is the electricity that a power plant was capable of generating but had to curtail due to power system conditions 
beyond the control of the power plant. 5.5. INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITIES AND SKILLS
Developing an energy sector with an increased share of renewables requires 
competencies beyond the conventional fossil fuel-based system that currently exists. 
These competencies are both at the institutional level in enabling an overall systematised 
deployment of renewables and at the individual level in building a qualified workforce 
at all stages of the value chain to adequately support renewable energy deployment. 
In Belarus, there is a need to strengthen both human and institutional capacities for 
renewable energy deployment across all sectors, including within the public sector on 
renewable energy target setting and reporting, in the private sector on due diligence 
of project preparations, in the financial sector on green financing, and in academia in 
nurturing technological research and innovation. 
IRENA and Terawatt Initiative’s Open Solar Contracts platform provides support for streamlining 
project development and finance processes by offering simple and universally applicable legal 
agreements that decrease transaction costs, shorten project development timelines and facilitate 
balanced risk allocation, making contracting much faster and less costly. With the support of several 
top-tier law firms, the contracts are publicly available on the Open Solar Contract website and include: 
Power Purchase Agreement, Implementation Agreement, Operation and Maintenance Agreement, 
Supply Agreement, Installation Agreement and Finance Facility Term Sheet. These contracts are 
fine-tuned for small and medium-sized, grid-connected solar PV projects. Going forward, a similar 
process will be initiated for wind projects. Upon request, IRENA provides training on the use of the 
Open Solar Contracts and how to tailor them to the needs of project proponents.
IRENA’s project facilitation through the Climate Investment Platform
The Climate Investment Platform (CIP) is a global initiative supported by IRENA, the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and Sustainable Energy for All (SEforAll) in co-operation with the 
Green Climate Fund (GCF). The CIP’s objective is to step up climate action and translate ambitious 
national climate targets into concrete investments on the ground. While initially focused on energy 
transition, the ultimate goal of the initiative is to accelerate investments in renewable energy and 
enable the success of the NDCs.
The platform offers an avenue to strengthen existing collaboration and presents an opportunity to 
consider new ways for more effectively bringing together stakeholders to catalyse action, all within 
existing institutional structures and in line with the respective mandates of the partner organisations. 
In this context, investment forums, a key element of IRENA’s strategy to facilitate investments in 
renewable energy, offer an effective organising framework for the implementation of the CIP through 
a sub-regional approach. 
In operationalising the CIP, IRENA intends to work with multilateral, bilateral and local financial 
institutions; private companies and investors; and development partners who are prepared to provide 
financial and technical resources and support the realisation of projects.Electricity generated
by renewable energy
prosumers needs to be
accounted for in ofcial
statistics
Action 11: Building human and institutional capacities for renewable energy 
development
Within the public sector, planning and facilitating renewable energy deployment through 
incentive schemes are the two priority areas that require capacity strengthening. In 
planning for renewable energy investments, a holistic statistical basis is required. Energy 
sector statistics in Belarus are regularly updated, publicly reported and comprehensive. 
However, reporting on renewable energy generation needs to be improved. Currently, 
electricity generated by renewable energy prosumers, such as solar PV installations 
for self-consumption in the residential sector, is largely unaccounted for in official 
statistics. This skews reporting on the achievement of energy targets and does not 
enable a holistic understanding of the degree of uptake, the efficiency and operational 
experience of installed systems, and potential for further deployment. This in turn offsets 
appropriate planning and the need for developing various policy incentives such as the 
development of a prosumer strategy and appropriate incentives. Forming a working 
group is necessary to design a methodology for the assimilation of renewable energy 
production by decentralised and stand-alone systems, which would capacitate BELSTAT 
and other public institutions in collecting and utilising such data for further energy sector 
planning and policy development. Furthermore, renewable energy auction design is 
another policy mechanism that requires capacity-building efforts in public institutions 
and among policy makers. 
Within the private sector, insufficient due diligence in preparation of renewable energy 
project documentation also hinders project financing. This can be mainly attributed to 
the lack of local skills in project development and engineering design. For example, 
there tends to be a lack of high-quality energy audits; design estimates on technical, 
financial and economic viability; long-term operational projections; and estimated return 
of investment. All of this hinders potential investors and financiers in assessing the 
economic viability of proposed projects. Usually, international experts are relied upon to 
carry out various feasibility studies. 
Inadequate competences are also reported in the 
various segments of the value chain of developing 
renewable energy projects, including procurement 
and manufacturing, installation (especially for PV 
and wind), operation, and maintenance. A local 
workforce in such areas is not readily available, 
evidenced by the fact that most larger projects have 
been implemented by Russian and other European 
companies. As such, practical skills at academic 
institutions and on-the-job training need to be 
enhanced to ensure a qualified workforce for the development of a renewable energy 
sector in Belarus. The practical skills of the workforce can be developed by adjusting the 
curriculum for the relevant higher education institutions to include more practical training 
on renewable energy technologies and by facilitating individual training programmes for 
the construction, installation and operation of renewable energy technologies. Figure 27 
shows an example of human resource requirements for the operation and maintenance 
of onshore wind projects.The local financial sector in Belarus is inexperienced in financing renewable energy 
projects, and it has insufficient capacities for and a lack of expertise in appraising 
renewable energy project proposals. Most commercial lending has been done through 
credit lines facilitated by IFIs which have also, to some extent, provided technical 
assistance in project appraisals. Nevertheless, such experience gained by local financial 
institutions is not readily shared among the financial sector, and there is a continued need 
for development partners to support local financial institutions with technical assistance 
in project appraisals and create the impetus for local renewable energy financing. 
In terms of research and development, there is a low demonstration of working 
effectiveness of renewable energy technologies in Belarus and low levels of technological 
innovations locally. This leads to an over-reliance on equipment imports and studies that 
are not specific to the local context. It is necessary to determine the priority directions 
for the development of scientific research in the field of renewable energy and ensure 
comprehensive co-operation of national scientific organisations with industrial and energy 
enterprises, international organisations, development partners and foreign researchers to 
build the capacities of local institutions in renewable energy technology innovation.
