1.1 INTRODUCTION
Formulation of the Strategy for the Energy Sector 2017–2030 has taken place during a period of dynamic 
developments in Albania’s energy sector. During this period, a number of framework laws and regulations 
were drafted and adopted, the electricity sector was going under important structural, legal, tariff reforms, 
and the oil and gas sector was subject to important developments. Also, during this period, Albania has 
continued to implement its obligations and commitments towards regional integration through the Energy 
Community and it has taken on new international commitments and initiatives, including in relation to 
climate action. All of these activities have served as a foundation for development of this National Energy 
Strategy.
The Strategy represents a synthesis of detailed energy sector analysis, and other sectoral and crosssectoral strategic and planning documents, much of which was incorporated into an analytical review of 
future development pathways for Albania’s energy sector. Many of the key documents referenced in this 
Strategy were still under review during this period, and the strategy represents the most current 
information on these documents as of early 2018, and an analytical review of future development pathways 
for Albania’s energy sector. 
As a complex and multidimensional process, this Energy Sector Strategy has been guided by the political 
leadership of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy, supported by a Working Group, established with 
participation of the Ministry’s key Departments, ERE, AKBN, power utilities (KESH, OST and OSHEE) 
and oil and gas companies like ALBPETROL, ARMO, ALBGAS. This Working Group coordinated the 
process for drafting the National Strategy for the Energy Sector and was closely supported by USAID with 
technical expertise1 from USAID’s strategic team, composed of leading experts in the fields of electricity, 
oil and gas, renewables, energy efficiency and strategic energy planning.
As announced at the Energy Community Ministerial Council meeting on 14 December 2017, the Republic 
of Albania will engage, in cooperation with the Secretariat of the Energy Community, in elaborating and 
adopting an Integrated Energy and Climate Plan in the course of 2018. This Plan will complement the 
present Strategy, and will address the five mutually reinforcing and interrelated dimensions2, adapted in 
the context of Albania, to bring greater energy security, sustainability and competitiveness. The five 
mutually supportive dimensions are:
1. Energy security, based on energy sources diversification, solidarity and trust;
2. Fully integration into the regional and subsequently European market;
3. Energy efficiency contributing to moderation of demand;
 
1 The USAID’s technical assistance was provided in the framework of the regional program “Enhancing Capacity for 
Low Emissions Development Strategies (EC-LEDS) 
2 Five dimensions of the Energy Union set out in the European Commission's Communication of 25 February 20154. Decarbonizing the economy;
5. Research, innovation and competitiveness;
1.2 METHOD FOR DEVELOPING THE STRATEGY
The principles guiding the development of this strategy are fully in line with the principles of the Second 
National Strategy for Development and Integration, and their goals are to:
 Increase the security of energy supply while ensuring sustainable development and providing 
affordable energy costs for Albanian citizens and the economy; 
 Further diversification of supply sources and interconnection with the regional and European 
electricity and gas networks
 Establish a competitive and organized market that provides correct signals for production and 
consumption of electricity and natural gas, considering the specific influence of climate changes on 
the domestic power production;
 Couple the electricity market in line with the commitments made under the so-called Berlin 
process3;
 Ensure that the climate change targets are met, including the renewable energy resource (RES)
and energy efficiency targets 
The analysis of the Albanian Energy Sector was performed using the Albania-LEAP4 model, a proven tool 
used previously by the Albanian Government and commonly used by other countries in the region and 
globally. The analytical results provided quantitative metrics for assessing the likely outcomes of possible 
energy scenarios against the strategic goals of this strategy. 
The assessment of the institutional reform priorities was developed in consultation with a large variety of 
stakeholders inside and out of the government aiming to discuss the key policy and legislative instruments 
driving energy sector reform in Albania and identify actions to meet the legal requirements and political 
commitments. For the Power Sector, the discussions included the Electricity Market Model, creating an 
Agency for Energy Efficiency, developing an Energy Efficiency Fund in accordance with the Energy Efficiency 
Law, and other priorities such as the development of secondary legislation for implementing the Power 
Sector, Oil & Natural Gas, RES and EPB Laws. Discussions regarding the oil and gas sector included the 
role of key institutions and reforms needed to modernize the sector and prepare the proper institutions 
and entities for a potential gasification of the economy. Particular attention was given to the need for 
capacity building and restructuring of Albanian energy institutions and energy public companies. 
 
3 The Berlin Process is a diplomatic initiative linked to the future enlargement of the European Union. The Berlin 
Process is an intergovernmental cooperation initiative aimed at revitalizing the multilateral ties between the Western 
Balkans and selected EU member states, and at improving regional cooperation in the Western Balkans on the issues of 
infrastructural and economic development.
4 Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) The need for continuation of the electricity tariff reform was assessed, including the importance that such 
a reform has on the creating the right incentives for electricity market participants. The chapters on 
incentives for energy efficiency investment and introducing Contract for Difference (as support scheme)
for RES electricity generation were based on a comparative assessment of best practices in the old and 
new EU Member States.
Analysis of how well Albanian legislation aligns with the EU energy acquis was based on independent 
assessments of Albania’s status, e.g. by the Energy Community Secretariat, and through discussions with 
sector experts in Albania. The assessment of the potential for integration into the regional/EU energy 
market was based on research into regional market plans and discussions with local experts regarding the 
Albania’s competitive position in these markets. 
1.3 ALIGNMENT WITH OTHER KEY DOCUMENTS
Albania’s Energy Sector Strategy is harmonized in terms of goals, energy sector details and timeline with 
a number of other strategic and legal documents that are in force, adopted or drafted in the same time 
frame as this document. Building on and complementing these documents has led to synergies in the 
prioritization of policies and programs and in the development of strategic recommendations.

1.4 CURRENT ENERGY SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION 
In 2014, 2015, 2016, Albania’s total primary energy production was respectively 2,014 ktoe, 2117 ktoe, 
2013 ktoe. The respective gross inland consumption in 2014, 2015, 2016 was 2,342 ktoe, 2219 ktoe, 2309
ktoe while net imports were 1888 ktoe, 1508 ktoe 1358 ktoe. Albania’s primary energy supply is 
dominated by oil, hydropower, and imported electricity as shown in Figure 1, which shows that imports 
of oil by products, electricity and a small amount of coal comprise over 56% of all primary energy 
consumption. Figure 2 shows that the transport sector consumes the most final energy, followed by 
households and industry, and the three dominant final energy fuels are oil products, electricity and wood. 
The figures illustrate the following characteristics of the Albanian energy sectors:
- The heavy dependence on oil imports
- The importance of hydro power
- The large transport sector share of energy consumption
- The absence of a natural gas sources.
Figure 1: Primary Energy Supply and Imports – 2014 Figure 2: Final Energy Consumption by Sector – 2014
Electricity generation has been historically met almost exclusively by hydropower plants, with a total 
installed power capacity of 2,011 MW at the end of 2016. The country has exploited approximately 50% 
of its hydropower potential, and future expansion of hydropower capacity is possible mainly along the 
Drini, Mati, Vjosa, Devolli, and Bistrica rivers. The only thermal power plant, Vlora TPP, is not yet 
operational, and its conversion to natural gas is foreseen following construction of the Trans Adriatic 
Pipeline (TAP). Albania imports electricity from neighboring countries, although imports have 
progressively dropped in the last ten years following the increase in domestic power generation and the 
reduction in of (technical and non-technical) electricity losses in the distribution system, which have been

Albania’s electricity market is under transition from a centrally planned to a market-based system. The 
wholesale power market is dominated by the state-owned, regulated generation company KESh, which 
supplies to OshEE the electricity needed for captive customers under regulated “full supply” condition. 
The competitive wholesale environment consists of independent producers and a small number of large 
customers supplied through bilateral contracts. 
1.5 LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR
The Ministry of Energy and Industry, together with all other energy stakeholders, are working to fulfill 
their commitments to implement the Third Energy Package. In addition, Albania had the first gas 
transmission system operator, TAP AG, certified under Third Energy Package procedures, which has laid 
the groundwork for development of a gas market via the Trans Adriatic Pipeline. ERE also certified the 
second gas transmission system operator, Albgaz, on 8 Nov 2017
The new Power Sector Law transposing the Third Energy Package in the electricity sector was adopted 
in April 2015 and entered into force on 13 June 2015. A draft Law on some amendments of the Power 
Sector Law is currently in the process of being approved in the Parliament, which will create the legal 
basis for the establishment of the Albanian Power Exchange and market coupling with Kosovo.
Following the obligations stipulated therein, the Energy Regulatory Entity (ERE) and the Ministry of Energy 
and Industry started the process of harmonizing the secondary legislation required for the reforms and 
liberalization of the electricity market. In March 2017, ERE approved the final certification of the 
ownership unbundling of the electricity system operator, OST. 
The electricity market reforms will go beyond the implementation of the Third Energy Package inside the 
country. Albania is a member of the Berlin process or Western Balkans Six (WB6) initiative and has 
committed to regional electricity market integration as an intermediary step toward a European electricity 
target model. Further, as a part of WB6 initiative Albania has committed to climate action. 
In July 2016, the Council of Ministers adopted a new market model for the regulation of Albania’s 
electricity market. The Council also adopted a plan to phase-out price regulation and to enable all market 
participants to freely trade on the market. An action plan for setting up a power exchange, which envisages 
an organized day-ahead market in the second half of 2017, was also part of this package. The market model 
envisages the coupling of the Albanian market with the Kosovo market and other neighboring countries.
By commissioning the new 400 kV interconnection line with Kosovo in June 2016, Albania took a further 
step towards its regional electricity market integration. The two system operators have already developed 
and tested a mechanism for procurement of capacity for secondary reserve. The Power Sector Law of 
2015 is in line with the Third Energy Package and transposes Directive 2009/72/EC and Regulation (EC) 
 
5
Implementation of the project "Recovery of the Power Sector" and the recent revamping work carried out on the 
transmission-distribution networks during the years 2014-2016.714/2009. However, the secondary legislation is yet to be adopted, thus delaying the implementation of 
the Third Energy Package. 
Over the years, Albpetrol has transformed itself from a fully operational oil company towards the role of
an agency with no active involvement in upstream oil and gas operations, while retaining huge number of 
the employees on its payroll. At present Albpetrol's primary source of revenue is the overriding royalties 
or share of profit it obtains from private oil and gas companies. These are functions that should be 
performed by a government agency, rather than Albpetrol. Hence, Albania today has, in effect, two 
government agencies overseeing the oil and gas sector, with the more appropriate agency for this role 
(AKBN) having been substantially weakened. The other players in Albania's upstream market are private 
companies that have obtained rights over existing oil and gas fields as well as new exploration and 
production. Albania's ad-hoc licensing approach has resulted in a predominance of small companies 
operating in Albania. Rather than focusing on company size, the criteria the Albanian government should 
use for assessing potential investors should be the qualifications and experience of companies in the oil 
and gas industry, supplemented by a competitive process for license access. The time would appear to be 
right for Albania to shift course and invite investors to bid for licenses on a competitive basis.
1.6 STATUS OF ENERGY SECTOR ALIGNMENT WITH EU ACQUIS
In line with its obligations under the Energy Community and as part of Albania’s strategic objective to 
accede to the EU, the Government has worked to align its legislation with the legal framework of the EU, 
and aims to establish clear and transparent responsibilities for the implementation of EU Acquis. The 
relevant primary legislation includes the Power Sector Law No. 43/2015, the Natural Gas Sector Law No. 
102/2015, the Energy Efficiency Law No. 124/2015, the Renewable Energy Sources Law No. 8/2017, the 
Law No. 68/2012 “On Information of the Consumption of Energy and Other Resources by Energy-Related 
Products”, and the Law on Energy Performance of Buildings No. 116/2016.
In line with the EU legislation and the EC Treaty, the Albanian Government has developed and adopted 
the respective National Action Plans for Energy Efficiency and RES. Also, the national energy regulatory 
authority (ERE) already issued a significant set of secondary regulatory acts. However, important 
regulations and secondary legislation, which are necessary for the full application of these laws, have yet 
to be developed, and the Government and ERE should continue to develop and implement regulations 
and secondary legislation for energy efficiency and renewable energy sources; improve strategic planning 
for physical capacities, financial requirements and budgetary implications of the energy sector; ensure that 
the goals of loss reduction and full bill collection are completed by OShEE; ensure unbundling of OShEE
and speed up the implementation of the energy acquis considering that faster implementation will facilitate 
much needed investments and influence the local market towards sustainable energy objectives.
Near-term priorities for the future include developing secondary legislation and regulations for 
implementing the Law on Energy Performance of Buildings, the Law on Energy Efficiency, amending the 
Power Sector Law and adoption of the secondary legislation for establishing and functioning of the 
Albanian Power Exchange, the electricity market coupling with Kosovo and other neighboring countries, 
developing and adoption of the secondary legislation for implementation of the RES law, and developing 
and approving a specific regulation transposing the EU Regulation no.347/2013 on guidelines for TransEuropean Energy Infrastructure
A special attention will be devoted to the implementation of the obligations established under the Council 
Directive 2009/119/EC of 14.09.2009 on maintaining minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products and the law no.8450, dated 24.02.1999 “On refining, transportation and trading of oil and its 
byproducts” as amended.
Considering that the energy sector is one of the key sectors with a large impact on the climate change, 
the Albanian Government is planning to finalize soon a new draft Law on Climate Change, which will serve 
as a legal basis for setting a more detailed framework for climate actions and clear competences and 
responsibilities for Ministry and other subordinated agencies responsible for energy sector and Ministry 
of Tourism and Environment.
The draft Law on Climate Change, which will sets the framework for climate actions, is under development
and is expected to be adopted by middle of 2018. 
1.7 ENERGY SECTOR CHALLENGES 
Since 1992, the Albanian economy has experienced a transformation from a centralized to a market 
economy. The GDP per capita value has increased in the last two decades due to a number of factors, 
including an ambitious program for the economic development, development support offered by donors, 
and a favorable geographic position as a bridge that connects the Balkans with Western Europe. The 
challenges currently facing the Albanian energy sector include:
 Meeting the economic developments in different sectors and the growing level of energy 
consumption per capita;
 Improving the trend of energy intensity reduction;
 Enhancing security of energy supply by improving energy efficiency, increasing the share of 
renewables and other indigenous energy sources, and increasing regional cooperation and 
integration. 
Historically, Albania’s energy consumption per capita is very low, which indicates low levels of economic 
activity as well as modest levels of comfort in the household and service sectors. On the other hand, 
energy intensity, which is the ratio of primary energy supply in a given year and GDP produced in the 
same year, has been very high. The reasons are the same as for the other Central and Eastern European 
countries: Albanian industry had been orientated towards energy intensive industries such as mining and 
metallurgy, and energy prices were kept at relatively low levels. Thus, one of Albania’s most crucial 
challenges is how to increase the low per capita energy consumption while at the same time reducing the 
high level of energy intensity in order to have an efficient economy that will compete in the domestic and 
foreign markets. 
The challenges related to energy security include meeting the country’s demand for crude oil with 
domestic production in decline. The total primary energy demand cannot be met with domestic energy 
sources. They have continuously declined during the period 2001-2016, with the self-sufficiency of primary 
energy sources declining from 97% in 1990 to approximately 41.2% in 2016. Thus, it is clear that meeting 
the country’s energy demand requires further development of domestic resources as well as liberalization 
and integration in the regional market
In addition to the challenges above, three future challenges for the Albanian energy system are to reach 
the RES target in 2020 and beyond, the EE target for reduction in final energy use, and the NDC target 
for GHG emission reductions. These energy sector challenges are compounded by the uncertainty in 
energy and economic indicators, the lack of an appropriate and effective infrastructure to collect data, and 
the lack of development strategies in some sectors. The final challenge is management of the transition to the new market model, including the protection of 
vulnerable customers. 
 2. STRATEGIC VISION, POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES 
This National Energy Sector Strategy contains the following Vision for 2030: 
Development of domestic energy sources, leading to a regional integrated and diversified energy 
system based on market principles, able to meet demand for energy and for sustainable 
development of the economy, ensuring security and quality of supply, safety, environmental 
protection and climate action, and increased welfare. 
2.1 STRATEGIC CONTEXT 
The Energy Strategy for Albania 2017-2030 is the core strategic document for the country’s energy sector. 
It is consistent with the national efforts to sustain economic development, and meet commitments to the 
Energy Community, EU integration and other international agreements, while increasing the security of 
energy supply and minimizing environmental impacts with affordable costs for Albanian citizens and the 
economy. 
The Energy Sector Strategy is developed in accordance with the National Strategy for Development and 
Integration II (NSDI - II), and it is the sector strategy that will guide the policy-making at high levels of the 
public institutions, as well as the private sector.
The Energy Sector Strategy is part of the Integrated Planning System (IPS) and is intended to be an 
important reference document that will enable development partners to align their development and 
cooperation strategies and programs with Albania’s priorities and framework for development and EU 
integration. 
The Energy Sector Strategy was prepared in compliance with the requirements of Article 4(2) of Power 
Sector Law (Law no.43/2015, date 30.04.2015) and with the support of the USAID Enhancing Capacity for 
Low Emission Development Strategies (EC-LEDS) program, which is part of worldwide efforts to address 
climate change and promote transitions to low-carbon economies. The national energy-sector strategy is 
designed to meet the development needs of the country and provide its citizens/consumers with a stable, 
reliable and affordable energy supply based on the regional integration and diversification of the energy 
sector. 
2.2 GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The principles guiding the development of this energy strategy are consistent with the goals of the NSDI 
– II, specifically to:
 Increase the security of energy supply with affordable costs for Albanian citizens and the economy; 
 Further development of domestic energy sources, and diversification of supply sources and 
interconnection with the regional Energy Community and European electricity and gas networks
 Establish a competitive market that provides correct signals for production and consumption of 
electricity and gas;
 Provide incentives for implementing the necessary climate action policies, such as reaching 
renewable energy resource (RES) and energy efficiency targets and for decreasing adverse 
environmental impacts.The following long-term strategic objectives were identified to actualize the Guiding Principles 
and the current commitments that have been undertaken by the Albanian government. 
 Improving the reliability and security of energy supply;
 Developing the domestic primary energy sources in a sustainable and competitive manner
 Improving the cost-effectiveness of energy supply systems;
 Achieving the targets for renewable energy sources and energy efficiency established in the second
National Energy Efficiency Action Plans and the National Renewable Energy Action Plan;
 Developing least-cost and sustainable policy for residential heating and cooling
 Integrating the Albanian power and natural gas markets with regional Energy Community and 
European markets; and
 Achieving the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emission reductions.
2.3 POLICY SCENARIOS
The key policies impacting the Energy Sector and related climate actions in Albania include policies needed 
to:
 Meet the current commitments to the Energy Community for energy efficiency and renewable 
energy implementation, and the country’s GHG reduction commitment under the Paris Accords 
and other climate actions policies as part of WB6 commitments,
 Prepare for a possible natural gas market within Albania, and 
 Better integrate with the EU and regional markets, with a specific focus on efforts for coupling 
the Albanian and Kosovo electricity markets as a first step toward regional market coupling. 
To understand the costs and benefits of these possible policies, the following six scenarios were developed 
and analyzed using the Albania-LEAP6 model.
 Baseline Scenario: This represents the most likely evolution of the Albanian energy sector with 
no any further policy interventions. This scenario is the base for comparison with the policy 
scenarios below.
 Energy Efficiency (EE): This scenario assumes that Albania meets its Energy Community Treaty 
commitments by implementing the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan and enforces 
the Law on Energy Efficiency (together with improvement of the Law to transpose EED 
requirements) and the Law on Energy Performance in Buildings.
 
6 Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP)  Renewable Energy Sources (RES): Assumes that Albania meets its Energy Community Treaty 
commitments of reaching a 38% renewable energy target in 2020 by implementing the Albanian 
National Renewable Energy Action Plan.
 Natural Gas Promotion: Assumes maximum possible penetration of natural gas in line with 
the Gas Master Plan.
 Albania-Kosovo Coupling: Assumes the coupling of the Albania and Kosovo electricity markets 
by establishing a single bidding zone with a common PX platform and algorithm for settling market 
transactions.
 Combined: Combines the EE, RES and Natural Gas Promotion scenarios.
2.4 POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES
2.4.1 RECOMMENDED POLICY OBJECTIVES
The Energy Strategy addresses new laws, regulations and institutional reforms currently underway in 
Albania, including incentives for EE and RES, electricity tariff reform, market development and integration 
with EU and regional markets. With the implementation of the National Energy Strategy, Albania aims
to achieve the following results: 
 Reduced energy imports and increased domestic energy generation by meeting future energy 
demand in a sustainable manner while increasing social welfare
 Improved energy efficiency in the household, services and industrial sectors 
 Increased use of RES technologies, based on least-cost planning, sustainability, climate action and 
environmental protection
 Penetration of natural gas in the Albanian energy sector through key infrastructure investments
 Development of mechanisms to encourage foreign direct investment in the Albania energy sector.
 Increased competition in the energy market while preserving customer and investors interests;
 Improved alignment and integration of Albanian energy-sector policy and regulation with the 
Energy Community energy acquis and regional and EU energy markets.
 Development of a policy framework for energy (including energy efficiency) in transport based on 
the “Transport Sector Strategy in Albania – Final Strategy & Action Plan (DCM No. 811, dated 
16.11.2016, and introduction of new technologies for all other sectors
 Development of a competitive market that provides correct signals for production and 
consumption of electricity and gas.
 Focused activities regarding the use, remediation or removal of existing non efficient energy 
infrastructure that adversely impacts environment and potentially high value areas for other 
development sectors, i.e. tourism, agriculture, etc. 
The results of the detailed analysis show that the most beneficial scenario for the Albanian energy sector, 
based on the strategic metrics, would be to implement all the measures from the EE, RES and AlbaniaKosovo electricity market coupling scenarios along with the power and industry sector components of the Natural Gas Promotion scenario. Removing the gas infrastructure investment required to enable gas 
access to residential and commercial customers would improve outcomes, presenting an optimal scenario 
for the development of the Albanian energy sector till 2030. The recommended development scenario 
has the potential to achieve the following results, which in many cases exceed the commitments made by 
the country: 
 Potential to reduce energy imports by 32% compared to the Baseline scenario;
 Potential to increase the RES share past 2020 by focusing the gas infrastructure investment to 
provide gas access to the power and industry sectors and not residential and commercial 
customers;
 Potential to reduce final energy demand by 19.4%, , close to the NEEAP target;
 Potential to reduce GHG emissions by 28% compared to the Baseline scenario;
 Potential to reduce electricity generation requirements by at least 31%, and
 Potential to reduce the Energy Intensity of GDP by 18%
 Potential to increase penetration of the TAP’s natural gas in Albanian primary energy supply from 
0.36% in 2015 to the 19.81% in 2030 
2.4.2 OTHER POLICIES & OBJECTIVES
Implementing this Energy Strategy will increase the security of Albania’s energy supply and begin to 
integrate the Albanian energy market into regional, the Energy Community and the European markets. 
This Strategy supports the country’s overall economic development goals, and is based on an optimal 
energy scenario that balances national interests with those of the different energy sub-sectors. In addition, 
the strategy is designed to support social development goals, by increasing employment through 
promotion of the green energy sector, stimulating competition in the Albanian energy market, ensuring 
supply stability by moving towards regional markets, increasing the welfare for energy consumers, and 
minimizing adverse impacts to the environment. 
Albania has signed the Paris Agreement on the 22nd of April 2016 in New York, entering in the new era 
of the climate international policy process. In fact, Albania joined the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995, and the Kyoto Protocol in 2005. Albania has started 
the process of changing the status from a developing country to a developed country, in the context of 
the UNFCCC. This process is an integral part of the process of integration into the European Union and 
involves the development of capacities at the national level for monitoring and annual reporting of 
Greenhouse Gases (GHG), the formulation and implementation of policies to reduce GHG and climate 
change adaptation, transposition and implementation of the European Union acquis on climate change. In 
line with the objectives of the EU 20-20-20, Albania has submitted its National Determined Contribution 
within the Paris Agreement process in September 2015, committing itself to reduce CO2 emissions 
compared to the baseline scenario in the period of 2016 and 2030 by 11.5%.
The level of National Determined Contribution will be reviewed and further elaborated upon in the 
Integrated Energy and Climate Plan to be developed and adopted in 2018. 3. ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MAIN PRODUCTS 
3.1 APPROACH TO ANALYSIS OF ALBANIAN ENERGY SECTOR SCENARIOS
The analysis of future development pathways for the Albania energy sector was performed using the 
Albania-LEAP model, a proven tool used previously by the Albanian Government and commonly used by 
other countries in the region and globally. The Albania-LEAP model was updated, calibrated to the 2014 
energy balance and updated to 2015 and 2016 energy data where available, and extended to 2030 for this 
analysis, as documented in the Analysis Report7. 
A Baseline scenario, which represents a business as usual approach to the energy sector, was developed 
based on the following data and assumptions:
(i) The base year was calibrated to the official 2014 national energy balance, and relevant 
2015/2016 data was considered as it became available. 
(ii) Future projections of energy demand are consistent with the baselines used in the NREAP 
and NEEAP analyses. 
(iii) Follows economic development objectives of the second National Strategy for Development 
and Integration (NSDI-II). 
(iv) Current structure of energy supply and demand in all economic sectors remains similar to the 
base year.
(v) A continued prevalent use of electrical energy for heating and warm water in residential and 
the service sector.
(vi) A significant portion of future demand for electricity will be met through new hydropower 
plants and new thermal generation based on imported natural gas.
(vii) The planned short-term measures from the national action plans on Renewable Energy 
Sources and Energy Efficiency will not be strictly implemented. 
(viii) National energy intensity will decrease only slightly from 2014-2030. 
The Baseline scenario serves as the reference for comparing each of the energy strategy scenarios that 
will look to accomplish specific policy goals. 
The Energy Efficiency scenario is based on Albania’s commitments under the Energy Community 
Treaty, the 2015 law on Energy Efficiency (No. 124), and the new law on Energy Performance in Buildings. 
The EE scenario also assumes that Albania implements the second NEEAP. The scenario includes 14 
specific measures needed to increase energy efficiency in both supply and demand.
 
7 Analysis of Energy Development Scenarios in Support of the National Energy Strategy of Albania, Report to USAID 
and Ministry of Energy and Industry, December 2016.The Renewable Energy scenario is based on Albania’s obligations as a Contracting Party to the Energy 
Community Treaty to comply with EU Directives on the promotion of renewable energy sources. One 
of the directive’s requirements is the preparation and adoption of a National Renewable Energy Plan 
(NREAP). The RE scenario incorporates Albania’s NREAP, which calls for increase the portion of 
renewables to 38 percent of the total final energy consumption by 2020, which should be further 
developed by 2030. 
The Natural Gas Promotion scenario calculates how much natural gas could penetrate in the different 
demand sectors (residential, service, industry, transport and agriculture) as well as power generation. This 
scenario assesses the costs and benefits of accessing natural gas from the Trans Adriatic Natural Gas 
Pipeline.
The Albania-Kosovo Coupling scenario assesses the impacts of integrating the operation of the 
electricity markets in Albania and Kosovo as a first step towards a regional coupled electricity market. 
This project, which is a Project of Mutual Interest, would have the following benefits:
 Reduced electricity system costs through more efficient utilization of cross-border capacity 
between Albania and Kosovo. 
 Improved security of electricity supply, especially given existing problems with blackouts and in 
some cases of load shedding.
 Greater utilization of the existing generation capacities and improved generating diversity.
 Improved power system control and system reserve by combining thermal (base) generation in 
Kosovo and hydropower (peak) capacities in Albania.
 Improved regional integration of Albania’s power market that could lead to further market 
coupling in line with the WB 6 commitments
 Improved competition and market efficiency due to increased market size.
The following strategic metrics were selected because of their relationship to the long-term strategic 
objectives. Each metrics is the change from the Baseline scenario for the following model outputs:
 Percentage of renewable energy utilization;
 Reduction in energy-related CO2 emissions; 
 Level of final energy consumption, 
 Level of electricity generation; and 
 Level of utilization of cross-border capacity;
 Fraction of energy imports in the total energy supply;
 Level of natural gas penetration into the total primary energy supply 
 Energy intensity of GDP.3.2 RESULTS OF ENERGY SCENARIOS ANALYSIS
In order to identify a national strategy that supports the best interests of the country and its 
citizens/consumers, each of the energy scenarios was evaluated against the strategic objectives mentioned 
above using the strategic metrics that were extracted from the Albania-LEAP model results. Each of these 
scenarios shows what is possible in the Albanian energy system under different policies. They quantify
the potential changes that would likely results from specific policy changes using the Baseline scenario 
as a comparison point, and are not a precise prediction of the future. The following section summarizes 
the scenarios results against each of the strategic metrics.
3.2.1 ENERGY CONSUMPTION TRENDS
From 2009-2016,, final energy consumption in Albania expanded from 1,871 ktoe to 2,060 ktoe, an 
increase of approximately 10.13 percent, but the growth was not consistent during the years. As shown 
in Figure 3, final energy consumption in Albania increased gradually between 2009 and 2011 before 
decreasing in 2012, coinciding with a slowdown in the Albanian economy. However, energy consumption 
rebounded sharply in 2013, in spite of slow GDP growth. This was mainly due to increased residential 
demand. Energy consumption increased significantly in 2014, driven primarily by the iron and steel 
industrial sectors.
Figure 3: Final energy Consumption Data (Source: Energy Balance of Albania 2009-2014, AKBN; INSTAT
The projections for the growth of energy consumption in Albania for the period 2014-2030, for each 
scenario are shown in the Figure 4, along with the projected GDP growth.

The Baseline scenario shows that the Final Energy Consumption will increase to 3,868 ktoe. All the other 
scenarios, except Natural Gas promotion show reduced Final Energy Consumption in comparison to 
Baseline scenario, while supporting the Albanian GDP growth.
3.2.2 ENERGY IMPORTS
Figure 5 shows the percentage of total energy imports for 2020, 2025 and 2030 for each of the scenarios. 
The Energy Efficiency (EE) scenario shows that there is a potential to reduce energy imports by 19%, 
final energy consumption by 28%, and GHG emissions by 27% compared to the Baseline scenario. The 
Gas Promotion scenario shows energy imports increasing by 22%, and the Albania-Kosovo coupling 
scenario shows that there is a potential to reduce imports in Albania by 24% compared to the Baseline. 
The Combined scenario shows the potential to reduce imports by 32% because of combining the EE and 
RES measures and by replacing hydropower used for space heating with natural gas.

Figure 6 shows the share of renewable energy sources in the total primary energy supply. Only the 
Renewable Energy Sources (RES) scenario achieves and maintains the NREAP target through 2020. 
It has an impact on the reduction of electricity and oil by products imports and it has the potential to 
achieve 1/3 the CO2 emission reduction compared to the EE scenario. The Gas Promotion scenario 
reduces RES utilization by replacing some electricity generated from hydropower used for space heating 
with natural gas. The Combined scenario also shows reduced RES utilization for the same reason, but 
the RES share is greater because of the reduced electricity demand produced by the EE measures. As a 
result, Albania would not meet its national target for RES after 2026.

Figure 9: Albania GHG Emissions (kt CO2 eq.)
At the European level a proactive approach involves all Member States in promoting a concerted 
international response to climate change. This involves mitigation efforts to control greenhouse gas 
emissions, as well as the promotion of adaptation measures to counter the adverse impacts of climate 
change that are already inevitable.
This Albanian Energy Strategy is fully in line and in harmony with EU “Low-carbon Economy Roadmap” 
and promotes EE, RES and natural gas policies that promote a stable business climate which will encourage 
low-carbon investments for the period 2017-2030. As the analyses supporting this strategy shows, there 
is significantly greater GHG reduction potential in the Albanian energy system than the initial NDC 
commitment, Therefore, the energy strategy and the policy objectives it envisions are in-line with the 
increasing ambition goals of both the UNFCCC and the EU/Energy Community. Given the current status 
of Albania as a candidate country in accession to the EU, it is likely during the period covered by this 
strategy Albania will accede to the EU. For this reason, as well as required by its Energy Community 
membership, it is of great importance that Energy Strategy is in line also with EU Climate Change Policy 
by ensuring that the energy policy objectives and the respective energy action plans identified in this 
document are supporting the levels of ambition expressed in EU CO2 reduction targets and climate change political goals. The Integrated Energy and Climate Plan to be adopted in the course of 2018 will be the 
key document for this purpose.
3.2.7 ALBANIA-KOSOVO COUPLING
The results of the Albania-Kosovo power market scenario shows there is a significant potential for 
better utilization of cross-border transmission capacity and increase the welfare through market 
optimization of operation of the thermal power resources in Kosovo and hydro resources in Albania
(specifically, the Drin River Cascade), as well as exchanging balancing reserve requirements. Figure 10
shows a breakdown of the projected changes in savings and costs for electricity generation and imports 
for this scenario. By 2030, the two systems combined would generate annual financial savings from 
reduced import costs of more than €1 billion. The results also show that under a joint Albania-Kosovo 
power market, generation costs would likely decrease in both countries. Further synergy effects can be 
expected from market coupling on an even larger scale, i.e. on regional level including the Energy 
Community Contracting Parties and neighboring EU member states in South East Europe.

3.3 RECOMMENDED DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO
Based upon the strategic metric results, the detailed analysis shows that the most beneficial development 
scenario for the Albanian energy sector would be to implement all the measures from the EE, RES and 
Albania-Kosovo electricity market coupling scenarios along with the power and industry sector 
components of the Natural Gas Promotion scenario by removing the gas infrastructure investment 
required to serve residential and commercial customers. The recommended development scenario is 
considered the most beneficial because it has the potential to achieve the following results: 
 Potential to reduce the energy imports by 32% compared to the Baseline scenario
 Potential to reach the RES target past 2020 by including the gas infrastructure investment to serve 
the power and industry sectors and not at the middle terms to the residential and commercial 
customers;
 Potential to reduce the final energy demand by 19.4%, compared to the Baseline scenario;
 Potential to reduce the GHG emissions by 28% compared to the Baseline scenario;
 Potential to reduce the electricity generation requirements by at least 31%, and
 Potential that natural gas to penetrate up to 19.81% of the total primary energy source by 2030;
 Potential to reduce the reduce the energy intensity of GDP by 18%
Implementing this Energy Strategy will increase the security of Albania’s energy supply and begin to 
integrate the Albanian energy market into regional and European markets. This Strategy is based on an 
optimal energy scenario that balances national interests with those of the different energy sub-sectors. In 
addition, the strategy is designed to create equal conditions for all energy companies engaged in the 
Albanian energy market, increase the welfare, and minimize adverse impacts on the environment. 
3.4 KEY POWER SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS
Albania is in the process of developing and implementing a number of key laws and regulations that will 
have an impact on the role of main stakeholders in the power sector, and in the area of energy efficiency
as well as climate action. This chapter summarizes the key areas of reform, sets out the implications for 
the role of both existing and new energy sector institutions, and identifies gaps between the actual 
situation and what is expected to be achieved after the successful implementation of the reforms.
3.4.1 POWER SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORM DRIVERS
The main drivers of reform in the power sector reforms include: The Energy Community Treaty (“ECT”), ratified by the Albanian Parliament with Law No.9501, 
dated 3.04.2006, which provides a legal framework for convergence with the European Union’s 
(“EU”) energy acquis8;
 Law No. 43/2015 “On Power Sector”, which was approved by the Albanian Parliament in April 
2015;
 New Market Model for the Albanian electricity sector, which was approved by the Council of 
Ministers Decision no. 519, dated 13.07.2016;
 Decision of ERE no.214, dated 28.12.2017 “On approval of Albanian Electricity Market Rules and 
Participation Agreement in the Day Ahead Market”;
 Law No. 124/2015 “On Energy Efficiency”, which was approved in November 2015; 
 Law No. 7/2017 “On Renewable Energy Sources”, which was approved by the Albanian Parliament 
in February 2017. 
3.4.2 ECT AND POWER SECTOR LAW
As a signatory to the ECT, much of Albania’s energy sector legislation and regulation is guided by 
requirements of the EU’s Internal Energy Market. Specifically, the ECT sets out a number of acquis, which 
comprises core EU legislation in the energy sector. More details on the component parts of the acquis 
that are relevant to the power sector are described in the Technical Annex.
Law No. 43/2015 “On Power Sector” was approved in 2015, with the primary objective of moving towards 
alignment with the EU acquis on electricity. The key reform actions and the progress being made against 
these actions are described in the Technical Annex.
3.4.3 NEW ELECTRICITY MARKET MODEL
A new Electricity Market Model (“Market Model”) for Albania was approved by the Council of Ministers 
in July 2016 and sets out changes to the electricity sector that would see a move away from the regulated 
market arrangements that have until now been in place, towards more liberalized trading arrangements. 
Implementation of the Market Model would also improve compliance with many components of the EU 
energy acquis set out in the ECT. In order to facilitate the establishing of the Albanian Power Exchange 
and enabling TSOs or Market Operators from other countries to join the APX, an amendment to the 
Power Sector Law was proposed and approved by the Albanian Government. The draft law is under the 
review and approval by the Parliament. 
OST has a full set of market rules to implement the Market Model, which were approved by the ERE in 
December 2017. It is intended that implementation of the new Market Model is phased in over the period 
2017-2020. The key characteristics of the new Market Model can be summarized as follows:
 
8 The EU’s “acquis communautaire on energy” is defined in Annex I of the Energy Community Treaty and includes a 
number of EU Directives and Regulations that are core to the regulation of the energy sectors of EU member states. Physical trading by market participants is exclusively to take place through the following platforms:
o A day-ahead (“DA”) and intra-day (“ID”) market, to be set up by a new Albanian Power 
Exchange.
o Trading of long-term physical power is permitted based on cross-border capacity bought 
through cross-border capacity auctions.
 All other forms of trading will be financial, for example through bilateral Contract for Difference 
(CfDs) or establishment of decentralized futures markets.
 Specific t bidding rules are to be developed and an efficient regulatory monitoring regime shall be 
enforced with the goal to prevent the abuse of any market power by specific participants.
 A Balancing Market which integrates imbalance settlement is to be established and operated by 
OST, which will balance supply and demand, starting from the positions nominated by market 
participants through physical trading, and through contracting for balancing services directly.
The new Market Model will have implications for existing commercial arrangements in the market:
 Where RES generators have Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) with the KESh public supplier, 
the intention will be for these volumes to be traded through the organized market, but with a 
Contract for Difference (“CfD”) put in place to keep the RES generator whole relative to the 
original PPA. The affected generators will need to be able to access a liquid reference price, which 
will be the index for settlement against the strike (fixed) price in the CfD. The wholesale public 
supplier role will also be transferred to OShEE once the new market model is implemented.
 There is currently a bilateral agreement in place between KESh and OShEE that governs supply of 
power to OShEE. In order to comply with the Market Model, these volumes will also be required 
to pass through the new power exchange. The Market Model refers to this as a “Market Maker 
Obligation” on KESh and OShEE. As with the IPPs, a CfD could be put in place between KESh 
and OShEE to provide a financial hedge against volatility in the organized physical market.
Once implemented successfully and accompanied by cost-reflective network and market access tariffs, the 
new Market Model should facilitate improved competition, first in the wholesale market, and then in the 
retail market. OShEE will retain its supplier business, and will be exposed to competition by new suppliers 
that could enter the market to supply end consumers. An overview of the commercial relationships in 
place on implementation of the Market Model is presented in the schematic in Figure 11.Figure 11: Recommended Schematic of the key commercial relationships under the Market Model
The implications of the Market Model are taken into account in setting out the roles of key power sector 
institutions. The most important actions and reforms that are required to implement the Market Model 
can be summarized as follows:
 OST, in consultation with other market participants including ERE, is to continue work to
finalize the market rules for implementing the new Market Model. In particular, rules for the 
Balancing Market, the procurement of balancing services, and the calculation of imbalance charges 
need to be defined.
 The Market Model will require the APE to be established as a separate legal entity with the 
participation of OST and other legal entities, and strengthening for the capability of the market 
unit within OST, with the required capabilities being built through recruitment and/or training.
 Affected market participants (e.g. IPPs), in consultation with ERE, need to draft new 
financial contracts, such as CfDs, where these are required as transitional measures to ensure 
that the intent of previous commercial agreements in honored under the new Market Model.
 All market participants will need to build new capabilities in order to interact effectively 
with the new market arrangement, for example establishing trading departments, or commercial 
teams to manage bilateral financial contracts.
3.5 ENERGY EFFICIENCY LAW
The new EE Law’s primary objective was to align with the EU’s Energy Efficiency Directives (2006/32/EC
and partly 2012/27/EU). The main objectives of the Law can be summarized as follows:
 Setting of a National Energy Saving Indicative Target, and preparation of a National Energy 
Efficiency Action Plan (“NEEAP”) that is to be updated at least every three years.
 Creation of an Agency for Energy Efficiency (“Agency for EE”) to oversee implementation of many 
of the Law’s provisions, and an Energy Efficiency Fund (“EE Fund”) to support and finance energy 
efficiency measures.

 Establishing criteria and standards for energy auditors and energy services providers.
3.6 RENEWABLE ENERGY LAW
The objective of the RES Law is to facilitate the harnessing of Albania’s significant renewable energy 
resources, in particular in the area of hydroelectric plants, biomass and biofuel resources. Through the 
Energy Community, Albania has set a binding target of 38% of its gross final energy consumption to be 
fulfilled from renewable energy by 2020, which is an ambitious target compared to 33.1% in 2014, mostly 
due to the increase of final energy consumption. Specifically, the RES Law will introduce a renewable 
energy support scheme for electricity based on Contracts for Difference (“CfDs”), which takes into 
account the creation of a competitive day-ahead electricity market. The details of the CfD-based support 
scheme will need to be closely coordinated with the drafting of Market Rules described earlier. An 
effective CfD mechanism will require a robust reference price that RES generators can access through a 
liquid wholesale market. This should be available once the Market Model has been fully implemented.
3.7 IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ROLES OF KEY POWER SECTOR INSTITUTIONS
Figure 12 presents an overview of the key power sector institutions and companies in Albania:
 Government and regulatory actors, which include government and ministries, the regulator, and 
agencies to whom ministries delegate specific sector responsibilities;
 Public sector companies, such as KESh, OST, and OShEE, who are currently major players;
 Line of oversight from the relevant ministry to each public sector company, reflecting the recent 
shift in oversight for OST to the Ministry of Economic Development to meet the unbundling 
requirements of the acquis.Figure 12: Key Power Sector Institutions in Albania
3.7.1 GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS
The most significant institutions in setting policy and regulation in the power sector in Albania are the 
Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (“MIE”) and the regulator, the Energy Regulatory Authority (“ERE”). 
In addition to MIE and ERE there are a number of ministries that have a smaller role in the sector, and 
also a number of government agencies with responsibilities with respect to the power sector that are 
delegated to them by the ministries.
Council of Ministers: The Council of Ministers is the cabinet of Albania, which along with the Prime 
Minister sets the overall direction for policy across the government. Specifically in the energy sectors, its 
role is review and approval of decisions that are proposed by MIE, such as this Energy Strategy, before
the decisions can go into force. 
Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (MIE): MIE has overall responsible for the energy sector and 
is responsible for developing energy policy and the medium and long-term strategies for the energy sector. 
MIE’s key area of focus in the power sector is continuing to make progress in implementing reforms to 
align Albanian policy and regulation with the EU’s energy acquis. This process is now well under way with 
the recent passing of the Law on the Power Sector, the EE Law, Energy Performance in Building Law and 
RES Law. Ministry through its Energy Efficiency Agency (EE Agency) and Energy Efficiency Fund (EE Fund)
is involved in some of the reforms being implemented to improve energy efficiency, specifically in 
implementation of the Energy Performance in Buildings (“EPB”) Law. 
While MIE is the ministry most engaged in the sector, there are a number of other Government ministries
that work with MIE in setting the overall policy agenda for the sector. These ministries, and the actions that they will need to take to implement the new laws, are set out below, and all government priority 
actions are summarized in Table 1.
Ministry of Finance and Economy: (“ MoFE”) includes the Directorate of Public Property, which 
oversees the economic and financial performance of state enterprises, including OST, KESH and OSHEE. 
The Directorate of Competitiveness is responsible for ensuring the free movement of goods and services 
and implementation of legislation to align with the EU’s internal market. In addition, the National Business
Centre subordinated to the Ministry of Finance and Economy helps new entrants to the market to navigate 
licensing requirements.
Ministry for Health and Social Welfare: is responsible to implement the requirement from the Law 
on the Power Sector that appropriate criteria are defined to identify vulnerable customers. The ministry 
needs to ensure these rules are implemented correctly so that the support available is targeted more 
appropriately. 
Ministry of Tourism and Environment ("MoTE"): has overall responsibility regarding protection of 
the environment and regarding the energy sector; MoTE is responsible, through the National Environment 
Agency), for approving the Environmental Strategic Assessment for planned development in the power 
sector. MoTE is also responsible for climate change related policies, and it serves as focal point for the 
Albanian Government under the UNFCCC.

Energy Regulatory Authority (ERE): The Energy Regulatory Authority (“ERE”) is an independent 
public body responsible for the regulation of activities in the electricity and natural gas sectors. ERE is the 
competent body for issuing licenses for carrying out electricity generation, transmission, distribution, 
supply and trade of electricity. It is responsible for approving the grid codes which govern connection with 
and access to the transmission and distribution networks to all power producers. ERE also has 
responsibility for approving tariffs in the sector, including feed-in tariffs for RES producers, tariffs for access 
to the transmission and distribution networks, and tariffs for end users supplied by the Universal Service 
Provider. ERE approves standard industry documents such as the standard PPA to be used by priority 
RES producers. ERE is also responsible for the development of most secondary legislation in the sector 
as well as approving the electricity market rules. 
Agency of Energy Efficiency: The establishment of the Agency of Energy Efficiency (“Agency of EE”) 
is required under the EE Law. Setting up the Agency for EE is clearly a priority of the Government based 
on the EE Law and the priority actions set out in Table 2 are to be carried out by MIE. Duties and 
responsibilities of the Agency for EE are set out in detail in Article 25 of the EE Law, and include:
 Develop secondary legislation and programs to promote energy efficiency.
 Develop and monitor the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (“NEEAP”) and prepare an annual 
progress report regarding the NEEAP.
 Work with market participants and stakeholders to develop a database to monitor progress being 
made in improving energy efficiency.
 Develop technical standards and regulations to improve the energy efficiency of products.
 Evaluate projects to improve energy efficiency for potential funding from the EE Fund.
 Support energy efficiency through providing advice, training, and developing open source contracts 
for energy services.
 Verify the accuracy of data from energy audits, if deemed necessary.
Energy Efficiency Fund: The EE Law mandates the setting up of an Energy Efficiency Fund that shall be 
managed by a Board of Trustees composed by representatives of different public institutions. 
Representatives of the private business associations might also be represented in the Board. The Energy 
Efficiency Fund shall be financed through agreements with donors, and shall be established and operated
as an independent public entity. The EE Law sets out clearly the types of projects that the Fund can be 
used to finance:
 Improvements to energy efficiency for end consumers or in the production, transmission, or 
distribution of energy, including projects awarded funding through voluntary agreements;
 Improvements to energy efficiency in public lighting, or in water supply and waste water treatment.
 Research and development activities, and development of demonstration projects for new 
technologies.
 Energy audits in the public sector.
 Improvements to metering and billing, and awareness campaigns regarding energy efficiency.3.7.3 OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND REGULATORY BODIES
In addition to the government departments and agencies set out above there are a number of agencies 
that have a smaller role within the power sector, mentioned below for completeness. There are no major 
changes to the roles carried out by these organizations as a result of the reforms currently being 
implemented.
AKBN – National Agency of Natural Resources: The National Agency of Natural Resources 
(“AKBN”) reports to MIE. AKBN mission is the development, supervision of rational use of natural 
resources, according to the government policy, and monitoring of their post-exploitation in mining, 
petroleum and energy. These responsibilities include:
 The proposal, consultation and cooperation with relevant government structures for the design 
of its policies and strategies in the field of mining, hydrocarbons and energy;
 The implementation of Government policies in the field of mining, hydrocarbons and energy;
 Ensuring within the scope of its activity, the government critical for studies and projects in the 
field of activity of mining, hydrocarbons and energy, presented by government or private entities, 
domestic or foreign. For special cases may require specialized assistance;

 Negotiation of petroleum and mining agreements and monitor the implementation of their 
development plans;
 Preparation of the necessary documentation and procedures for issuing permits, licenses, 
authorizations, in accordance with the law, which allow entry into the petroleum agreement and 
conducting petroleum operations under signed agreements;
 Monitoring the implementation of agreements on hydrocarbons;
 Supervises mining, hydrocarbons and energy;
 Performs the monitoring of areas used, the risk of closure of mining and mining activities;
 Monitoring the concessionary contracts for hydropower;
 Exclusively manages all primary hydrocarbon sector data and data related to mining and postmining activities;
 Propose measures to increase the use of energy in the energy cycle;
 Drafting and publication of the annual energy balance, in national and regional level, in accordance 
with Eurostat formats and International Energy Agency.
Once the new EE Agency is set up, AKBN will need to work closely with the new Agency to minimize 
overlap between the two agencies, and to ensure that both are working towards common goals. 
Specifically, responsibility for preparing plans for the implementation and monitoring of the NEEAP is likely 
to move to the Agency for EE and AKBN will be focus more towards RESAP.
AKPT – National Territorial Planning Agency and National Territory Council: The National 
Territorial Planning Agency (“AKPT”) is a public institution subordinated to MUD that is responsible for 
preparation and coordination of the national planning instruments. 
AZHT - National Agency of Development: AZHT has responsibility for making decisions regarding 
specific projects of national importance. This includes, for example, approval of construction permits for 
projects in the energy sector such as power generation, transmission and distribution, and oil and gas 
projects.
AKM – National Environment Agency: National Environment Agency (“AKM”) is an institution 
subordinated to the Ministry of Tourism and Environment, which is responsible for reviewing and 
approving the environmental impact assessments for large development projects, such as those in the 
energy sector. The Agency also has responsibilities for monitoring compliance with environmental 
standards.
PUBLIC ENERGY COMPANIES
In addition to the government departments and agencies presented above, there are a number of large 
public energy companies in Albania who are essentially the incumbent state-owned utilities. These 
companies will be affected by elements of the reforms being implemented, such as unbundling 
requirements, and the introduction of increasing levels of competition in the sector. The section below 
sets out some of the key implications of reform for these public energy companies, and the priority actions 
are summarized in Table 3.Albania Power Corporation, KESh: KESH remains the dominant electricity generator in Albania, 
generating ~75% of power generated in 2015. Originally KESh was established as a state-owned, verticallyintegrated company comprising all functions of electricity generation, transmission and distribution. In 
1995, according to two laws9, KESh was transformed into a joint stock company with 100% of the shares 
owned by the state, and KESh started to function as a commercial company. However, KESH is still largely 
regulated under public service obligations, because major part of the production is allocated to OShEE for 
supply of tariff customers.
Transmission System Operator, OST: OST is the Transmission System Operator (“TSO”) in Albania 
managing the network at 110 kV and above. On implementation of the power sector reforms OST will 
have three main roles:
 It will remain owner and operator of the transmission network – the reforms will have relatively 
little impact on this role on a day-to-day basis.
 It is initially likely to own the Albanian Power Exchange, which will be the primary trading 
platform for the organized power market in the competitive market. This is a new role in the 
Albanian market that OST will need to build capacity for.
 OST will continue to be responsible for balancing of the system through the procurement of 
balancing and ancillary services.
Distribution Company, OShEE: OShEE owns the electricity power distribution system below 110 kV. 
OShEE is a single legal entity that includes both the Distribution System Operator (“DSO”) and the 
Universal Service Provider. In 2009 OShEE was privatized in order to secure investment, improve 
operational efficiency, reduce power losses, and improve revenue collections. With support from 
government it was envisaged that this would overcome mounting losses and lead to lower, more affordable 
and competitive retail power tariffs over the medium-term. From the outset, however, challenges began 
to emerge between CEZ, the new owners, and government regarding bad debt provisions, the rate of 
loss reduction and annual tariff filings. The distribution license was revoked by the Albanian Energy 
Regulatory Authority (ERE) in 2013 on the grounds that the distribution company had failed to meet the 
conditions of its license. The company went back to public ownership and embarked on an ambitious 
program of loss reductions and improved collections and dramatically improved its financial position. The 
Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy and OShEE are working to unbundle the distribution wiring service 
from the Universal Service of suppling tariff customers. Unbundling of OShEE is an obligation under the 
Energy Community acquis and the Power Sector Law, which will create more transparency for all users 
of the distribution network.

13.07.1995 “On electric power.”3.8 KEY OIL AND GAS SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS
Albania’s petroleum sector is small by international standards, but is significant to Albania’s economy and 
has potentially large undiscovered reserves. Albania is one of the transit countries for the Trans Adriatic 
Pipeline, which will carry Azeri gas across Greece, through Albania, to Italy. By the end of 2020, the 
pipeline should give Albania access to natural gas for domestic use. The new pipeline will also connect 
Albania to the much larger economies of Greece and Italy, both of whom are important trading partners 
and sources of investment.
Albania’s state-owned oil company ALBPETROL estimates Albania’s proven oil reserves at roughly 220 
million barrels and natural gas reserves at approximately 5.7 billion m3 gas. Currently, nine companies 
hold Production Sharing Agreements (PSA) with the state-owned oil company ALBPETROL for 
development and production in the existing oil fields. Patos Marinza - Bankers Petroleum (2004); Ballsh

example in managing CfDs with legacy generators
● Complete legal and operational unbundling of distribution and supply functions by end 
of 2017
● Build operational capability to carry out responsibilities under the new Market Model; 
e.g. buying power on the APE, managing offtake contracts with RES generators and 
processing consumers that change electricity supplierHekal – Continental Oil and Gas (2016); Cakran Mollaj - Albpetrol; Gorisht Koculit - Albpetrol; Delvina
– Global Energy Management (2016); Kucova - Sherwood International Petroleum (2007); Visoka -
Transoil Group (2009); Amonica – Albpetrol, Drashovica, Finiq-Karne and Pekisht-Murriz – Phoenix 
Petroleum (2013); and Divjake, Ballaj-Kryevidh, Povelce, Panaja and Frakull – Phoenix Petroleum (2013).
As a result, heavy crude oil production in Albania has tripled over the last decade to 1.29 million tons in 
2015, with Bankers Petroleum (a Canadian oil company) driving almost the entire increase. There is little 
or no production of domestic natural gas. However, the steady decline of oil prices in the international 
market has caused a corresponding decline in oil production and investment in the sector in the past two 
years. China-based Geo Jade Petroleum Corporation has recently bought Bankers Petroleum for 
approximately $440 million.
The elements of government management over the oil and gas sector are dispersed through many
ministries, agencies and public sector entities, resulting in an ad hoc approach to policy, which needs to 
be focused to meet the specialized needs of the oil and gas sector. Institutional reforms are critical to 
improve the management force needed to effectively direct the rational development of nation’s current 
oil and gas sector. 
Albania’s decision to apply for membership in the European Union requires that the management of 
Albania’s oil and gas sector be brought into conformity with the EU Directives. This process, which is 
also driven by the imminent arrival of Caspian natural gas via the Trans Adriatic Pipeline transiting Albania 
to Italy, will require a major restructuring of the government’s ability to manage to the processes of gas 
purchase, distribution and sales to the domestic market. . Albgaz Sh.a, is a joint stock company that has 
been incorporated, stocks fully owned by the Albanian State, with the functions of a combined gas 
transmission and distribution system operator in the Republic of Albania.
As part of the transition required to join the EU, Albania became compliant under the Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative (EITI) in May 2013. The Government plans to use this as a platform for enhancing 
governance, transparency and accountability within the energy sector. It also plans on using it as a vehicle 
to strengthen the legal and institutional framework in the extractive industries and as a tool for removing 
the large regulatory barriers to economic agents that impede growth and job creation, by strengthening 
the legal and institutional framework in these subsectors. 
3.8.1 CURRENT NEEDS
To function effectively, the government requires the following facilities:
1. The Directorate for Strategies and Policies of Industry and Energy of MIE should develop 
mechanisms for appropriate petroleum policy.
2. AKBN, Albpetrol and ALBGAZ are responsible to organize the structures to supervise the 
implementation of these policies in an acceptable fashion and ensure their compliance with existing 
laws, regulations and contractual agreements.
3. The petroleum law has been successfully amended in February 2017 and the associated legal 
documents that reflects these policies, current international petroleum practices compliant with 
EU Standards.
4. A composite list of Petroleum Regulations that ensure that policy implementation progresses in 
an acceptable fashion, according to the government’s instructions.5. A trained set of Petroleum Inspectors who will monitor regulatory implementation for compliance 
and/or remediation.
6. Structural provisions to ensure that the produced reserves of petroleum are replaced, new 
deposits discovered, and modern mechanisms of exploitation are utilized.
7. ISHTI is responsible for Monitoring and quality control of all imported petroleum products, their 
distribution to the public to ensure that the public is served with sufficient supplies to meet their 
demands, that their quality meets international standards, the prices to be charged are fair and 
that there is sufficient storage of product to sustain unexpected delays in the supply chain.
8. Consolidating the legal framework for the gas sector in line with the Third Energy Package will 
create a solid basis for supporting policies and projects for the development of the gas sector in 
Albania, as well as its regional integration in line with the EU practices and standards.
9. Consolidating the legal framework for the implementation of the Oil Stocks Directive
10. Preparations for the advent of imported natural gas through the vehicle of the TAP, making 
possible the integration and supply diversification with energy sources. 
Most of these facilities currently exist, but require modifications to bring them the capability to implement 
effective management tools that are in compliance with EU laws. Their structure must be modified to fit 
the present needs, their mission must be re-defined, and they need to be staffed, managed and well trained. 
Authority and responsibilities must be quantified and secondary legislation written to define these new 
vehicles.
3.8.2 ENERGY REGULATORY AUTHORITY (ERE)
The Energy Regulatory Authority is an independent public body that is the single authority responsible for 
regulation of electricity and the natural gas sector as well. With the passing of the Law on Natural Gas 
Sector in September 2015, ERE has certified TAP AG pursuant to the tailor-made independent 
Transmission Operator (ITO) model elaborated under the Final Joint Opinion of the Energy Regulators 
on TAP’s exemption application in February 2016. TAP must finalize and prove its full compliance with 
the ITO rules under the EU Directive prior to the commencement of commercial operation, scheduled 
to take place by 31 December 2020. ERE certified AlbGaz as a Combined Operator of natural gas 
(Decision No. 179, date 08.11.2017).
3.8.3 MINISTRY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY (MIE)
The MIE has overall responsibility to manage the existing concessions of the National Oil Company 
(ALBPETROL) and those that have been granted to the foreign PSA-holding companies. A secondary 
objective to develop the future reserves through the promotion of private investment in an 
environmentally responsible and financially transparent manner. The legal climate for these investments 
needs to further be improved, including the appropriate petroleum regulations and mechanisms for their 
enforcement. Demand forecast for petroleum products throughout the country are to be made and
regularly updated, and arrangements must be made for the emergency stockpiling of petroleum products 
within the country to ensure compliance with EU Directives. Plans for the negotiating, off-taking, 
transmission, distribution and retail sales of natural gas from the TAP need to be developed based to the 
Gas Master Plan projects, prior to the anticipated arrival of gas at the end of 2020. Market reforms must 
be developed to comply with the Energy Community commitments and to complete the transformation of Albania into a member of the European Union. The internal administrative structure of the MIE, should 
therefore, with respect to petroleum, contain separate Directorates for each of these responsibilities. 
Priority actions for the government in the oil and gas sector are listed in Table 4.
MIE, through the Directorate of Policies and Strategies of Industry and Energy and the Directorate of 
Development Programs of Industry and Energy needs to develop and consolidate the specific roles and 
functions of oil and gas sector organization complying with the international best practices. 
It is important that the competency of the Ministry be such that Operating Companies will have a clear 
view as to what is required of them and that there will be penalties for non-compliance. The Directorate
of Policies and Strategies of Industry and Energy should in addition, provide direction and supervision to 
the management of two public companies, ALBPETROL and ARMO. Priority actions for MIE in oil and gas 
sector are listed in Table 5.

Directorate of Policies and Strategies of Industry and Energy in oil and gas sector3.8.4 ALBPETROL 
ALBPETROL is a wholly government-owned, vertically integrated oil company that has the exclusive rights 
for the development of all oil and gas fields. Most of the oil production over which ALBPETROL has 
production rights, has been contracted out to foreign companies of which nearly 60% is exported for 
refining into products elsewhere. Albania’s yet-to-be-discovered reserves of oil and gas, both offshore and 
onshore, are believed to be significant, but their exploration will require the use of sophisticated 
technologies which are not locally available. Programs must therefore be developed to present these 
opportunities to the international oil industry in a structured fashion as a means of converting them into 
tools of economic development for Albania.
The petroleum sector in Albania faces significant challenges in both the upstream and downstream. In the 
upstream, there has been a steep decline in production since the 1970s and 1980s, largely owing to the 
lack of investment in exploration.
Albania's existing and potential hydrocarbon resource makes c1ear that there is significant potential for 
Albania to achieve considerable economic benefit from more extensive and intensive petroleum 
exploration and development. Albania's two major petroleum basins, which have thus far produced 429 
million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), hold another 467 MMboe in proven and probable recoverable

● Monitoring existing operations with a view of either rejuvenating them or bringing them
to a realistic termination, including environmental remediation
● Planning for the national supply and demand for petroleum products: Procurement, 
Quality Control, Emergency Stockpiling, Product Distribution and the respective taxes 
(which will have impact on pricing); 
● Planning for ongoing modern exploration and development of the national petroleum 
endowment;
● Utilization of the industry to bring foreign direct investment funds, enhance technology 
transfer, infrastructure development, job creation, training and utilization of domestic 
goods and services.

● Monitoring existing operations with a view of either rejuvenating them or bringing them 
to a realistic termination, including environmental remediation
● Planning for the national supply and demand for gas: Procurement, guaranty of necessary

consideration feasibility for the consumers. 
● Planning for utilization of natural gas off-take from the TAP pipeline
● Utilization of the industry to bring foreign direct investment funds, enhance technology

goods and servicesreserves and also have estimated potential from yet undiscovered fields of 718 MMboe. All above 
mentioned figures are based on the declared figures of Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy as well as 
AKBN. These oil-equivalent estimates are expected to consist primarily of oil; but the potential for gas 
reserves from undiscovered fields is also significant at 5.7 billion cubic meters. 
Some preliminary study carried out from the IFC shows that the recent growth in Albanian oil production 
to roughly 21,400 barrel per day (bd) in 2013, largely on the basis of the ALBPETROL (Patos Marinza) 
field, which can be sustained and expanded to 44,000 bd by 2020, on the basis of horizontal drilling at 
multiple existing oil fields. After 2020, the potential exists for further growth in production on the strength 
of new discoveries-but only if Albania can optimize its policy framework to encourage high levels of 
exploration and development activity. Unfortunately, Albania's regulatory and investment framework for 
oil and gas exploration and production since the passage of the Petroleum Law in 1993 has been ineffective 
in promoting the development of these potentially considerable hydrocarbon resources and several 
amendments of petroleum law in February 2017 has significantly improve this law. The failure of two 
licensing rounds in the l990s, when crude oil prices were much lower than today, led to an unstructured 
ad-hoc approach to license negotiations. Nevertheless, the state has made all efforts to promote its 
acreage internationally through “open door policy” and active participation in international conferences. 
It is noted also the organization for the first time of the Oil & Gas Summit held in 2015 in Tirana, where 
participated almost all well-known international oil companies, such as SHELL, Exxon Mobil, BP, SOCAR, 
ENI etc.. 
3.8.5 CRUDE OIL REFINING PLANT
Albania's market for refined products is small by European standards, with total reported consumption of 
about 1 million metric tons (mt) per year at present. The plants employ 1960’s design technology and 
include 220,000 cm of storage capacity and 1500 employees in 2012. 85% of the State’s holding of the 
company was sold in 2008. 
Petroleum product demand is concentrated in the transportation and to a lesser extent, the agriculture 
sector and is dominated by diesel. Albania relies primarily on imported fuels, which are readily available in 
the regional market from Italy and southeastern Europe. The quality of petroleum products has been 
improved continuously and has reached the average EU level, since the level of abuse with the quality is 
not more than 5% of the total quantity, but have been plagued by substandard products. The number of 
retail gas stations relative to population is very high by European standards, and needs to decrease 
significantly in order to meet the best practices. 
Albania's refinery at Ballsh faces serious challenges to its continued commercially viable operation as crude 
oil refinery. It is very small by European and global standards, and thus lack the economies of scale and 
the catalytic conversion technology that is required to process the locally available heavy crude oils with 
their high sulphur and acid content. The refinery is located inland with logistical constraints that make it 
quite infeasible to consider imported crudes. 
3.8.6 ALBGAZ
ALBGAZ sh.a. Is a wholly-owned government company, created in the form of a combined gas 
transmission and distribution operator. (DCM No. 848, dated 07.12.2201 2016. ALBGAZ sh.a. will engage 
in the realization of important projects for the development of the gas sector in Albania, as well as for the 
interconnection of Albania with the regional gas networks.ALBGAZ Company includes the possibility of cooperation with foreign companies currently operating in 
Albania, such as TAP AG, but also with other companies that may be present in the future. The gas 
sector in Albania will face significant challenges because it is a commercial sector that will be built from 
the start but that will be one of the most important sectors that will make possible the diversification of 
energy sources and increasing the security of energy supply of different sectors of the economy and the 
population.

● Encourage consolidation of the retail fuels market through certification requirements 
and potentially also modest land-site taxes. 
● Support efforts to attract international retailers into the market. 
● Investigate options to reduce logistics costs in the petroleum sector through 
refurbishment of disused pipeline and rail infrastructure as well as road-building 
programs, where appropriate. 
● Support proposals that might emerge from the refinery owner to reorient its 
operations. 
● Exempt fossil fuels used in the refinery operations from the levy of excise duty.
● Undertake a feasibility study on renovating the existing refineries or building new skidmounted mini-refineries3.8.7 NATIONAL AGENCY OF ENVIRONMENT 
The National Agency of Environment (NAE) is an institution subordinated to the Ministry of Environment, 
which is responsible for reviewing and approving the environmental impact assessment reports for 
different projects carried out by licensed environmental experts for issuing the environmental permits. 
Although not a direct report to the MIE, the NAE is responsible for much of the important environmental 
regulatory work dealing with MIE-related project construction (such as the TAP, and possible 
rehabilitation of Ballsh and Fieri refineries. 
3.8.8 NATIONAL AGENCY OF NATURAL RESOURCES (AKBN)
AKBN is an independent agency reporting to the MIE and is responsible for the development and 
supervision of the exploitation of national natural resources based on government policies. AKBN is also 
responsible for monitoring post-exploitation cleanup in the mining, hydrocarbons and hydropower 
sectors. AKBN's competencies have been redefined more specifically through the amendment to the Law 
no. 7746/1993 "On hydrocarbons” (Exploration and Production), approved in February 2017.
3.8.9 STATE TECHNICAL AND INDUSTRY INSPECTORATE (STII)
STII is an agency reporting to the MIE that is responsible for preserving the public safety aspects of goods 
in the marketplace, focusing on electrical appliances, pressure vessels (especially LPG tanks for households 
and small business). STII is also responsible for public safety aspects of equipment used in power 
generation, transportation and distribution. Quality control of imported hydrocarbon fuels is included 
within the mandate of the Inspectorate, but skilled personnel and lack of adequate appropriate testing 
equipment has hampered these efforts. Although focused predominantly on the electric power sector, as 
STII has responsibilities in preserving the safety in gas infrastructure as well, the capacity building of this 
Inspectorate should be one of the near term priorities of MIE. Priority actions for the above mentioned 
agencies are listed in Table 7.
Table 7: Oil & Gas Sector Priorities and Actions - 4
National Agency 
of Environment
● Continues monitoring for upstream and downstream oil and gas activities with the 
main goal to follow strictly Environmental Mitigation and Management Plan for each

● Develop and implement clear demarcation between agencies as to who is responsible 
for energy sector planning and statistics if EU compliance is to be assured
● Develop secondary legislation for the collection of energy data in general and oil 
products in particular, including MOS (Monthly Oil Statistics) questionnaire
● Internal discussions within MIE should focus on increasing the professional expertise 
of the AKBN as the basis for the Technical Department, with contributions from the 
Contract negotiations unit as well
State Technical 
and Industry 
Inspectorate
● Sharply increase the technical competency of the staff of the Inspectorates. with a 
priority in gas sector
● Provide laboratory apparatus and equipment needed to undertake the mandated 
inspections3.9 NEED FOR A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS
Albania will provide a vital link and have a concrete institutional role in completing the energy loops that 
tie Italy, Central Europe and the Balkan states into a more integrated energy system that provides far 
greater energy security through a multitude of suppliers and energy transportation vehicles. The Albanian 
Government’s vision therefore is to promote economic development by serving as an energy transit 
corridor for electricity, natural gas and oil in all its forms, to move into greater Europe by sea and by 
overland pipeline. Its geographic location places Albania in the position of sharing its newly acquired energy 
sources with those of its neighbors in South East Europe, through the development of energy wheeling 
networks to strengthen the regional energy security of its neighbors, as well as itself.
Given the impending arrival of the TAP pipeline and the potential reinvigoration of domestic exploration 
and production of oil and gas both onshore and offshore Albania, the development of an integrated 
strategic plan for the entire oil and gas economic subsector is critical. Each of the many components of 
Government that will ultimately be related to the utilization of oil and gas, must be integrated into a single 
smooth, functioning system, connected to its adjacent related Ministries in such a fashion that the benefits 
of increase energy access may be shared by the rest of the government and through that, to the population 
in general. 
The broad elements inherent in a national strategy for the oil and gas sector include:
1. Establishing a baseline that adequately defines Albania’s present place in its oil and gas 
development. 
2. Defining a series of development objectives that are to be achieved against a fixed timeline for the plan to succeed by the agreed upon time, currently 2030. 
3. Creating detailed plans for implementation of each major component of the plan along a 
time-line. 
4. Adjusting existing Government mechanisms for administrative, technical management, 
legal, regulations, and regulatory compliance elements as required to efficiently administer and 
manage the economic development of the national petroleum resource.
Much of the above has already been accomplished, but needs to be organized and put into a plan format. 
There has been little apparent movement in this direction so far within Albania’s hydrocarbon sector.
3.10 INCENTIVES FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY INVESTMENT
Given the importance of energy efficiency (EE) measures, which includes RES use on the demand side, 
specific financing measures and fiscal incentives were examined based on best practices identified by old 
and new EU Member States. Table 8 shows the types of incentives that have been implemented by EU 
Member States in order to help achieve the targets set up in their various NEEAPs. The EU member 
States database10 describes both the measures and statistical evidence of how well the measures have 
performed. The applicability of successfully implemented schemes and mechanisms in the EU Member 
 
10 Energy Efficiency Policy Recommendations, IEA 2008, 2014States has been examined taking into account the specifics of Albania’s conditions. The details of this 
assessment, which supports the recommendations in this chapter, can be found in the Technical Annex.

3.10.1 GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
This chapter proposes recommendations for financing mechanisms and fiscal incentives in Albania to 
support the sustainable implementation of the Second NEEAP as well as to implement all measures 
presented under the EE Scenario presented in Section 1 of this strategy. No single measure is going to 
diminish the challenges which Albania is facing. Only a comprehensive package of awareness and 
information on legal, financial, fiscal and institutional measures will gradually improve the situation and 
bring Albania closer to modern standards in the energy efficiency field. Such a package should include: 
 Transposition and adoption of technical regulations and other secondary legislation, which should 
be prepared in the following short term period; 
 Fully staffed and operational Energy Efficiency Agency, as leading implementing body. 
 Capacity building at all levels;
 Continuous awareness raising campaigns; 
 Permanent advice and technical information on EE for all energy consumers;
 Establishment of the Energy Efficiency Fund shall be a legal person, having the status of a nonprofit organization and an energy tax as a source of income for the energy efficiency fund; The Fund aims to provide financial support and project management for developing a market of 
energy efficiency improvement and supporting programs for final customers with high-cost and 
high-risk investments.
 The Fund shall be used to promote energy efficiency improvement programs, energy service 
companies, independent energy experts, energy auditors, energy distributors, distribution system 
operators, retail energy sales companies and installers of efficient equipment
 Grants for low cost EE investments for vulnerable groups,
 Energy audits of public buildings;
 Grants for energy audits of multi-apartment buildings, commercial services and industry,
 Loans at lower interest rates from IFIs for EE investment in public buildings,
 Investment deduction for selected EE investments, 
 Detailed studies on appropriate fiscal mechanisms to support EE investments, especially related 
to VAT reduction for selected EE investments the relevant sector,
 Specific financing schemes for vulnerable groups (e.g. a ‘Pay as You Save’ mechanism),
 Detailed studies on poverty and energy service affordability, 
 Regulatory tariff incentives on energy efficiency.
3.10.2 ENERGY EFFICIENCY FUND
Energy efficiency funds are helpful in overcoming market barriers to energy efficiency investments in 
general and for specific energy consumer groups. At start-up, such a fund needs access to grant financing 
from global trust funds such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and this strategy recognizes that 
MIE is working in this direction with the support of the UNDP Climate Change Unit. Furthermore, the 
Government will try to get loans on favorable terms from IFIs like the World Bank, foreign financial 
institutions such as Climate Change Fund, WB, KfW, EBRD and the EIB, and bilateral donors for securing 
the initial EE Fund budget. In addition, the EE Fund will secure an initial fund from the State Budget based 
on the State Budget Law. The sustainable operation of the Fund will be guaranteed through a stable annual 
income coming from energy carrier and environmental pollution taxes. Ministry of Infrastructure and 
Energy will carry out a feasibility study for defining the amount of the expenses for the yearly operation 
of the fund and also covering the pilot projects carried out in the different sectors. When a market 
segment is sufficiently developed to attract commercial financing, the Energy Efficiency (EE) Fund’s 
objective has been reached and it can be phased out over the medium-term (at least five years).
Energy efficiency funds are usually established for implementation of national energy efficiency programs
and action plans. . An EE Fund may be based on one of three financing options: 1) loan guarantees, 2) 
interest rate buy-downs or investment deduction and 3) direct loans. EE Fund will not play the role of 
classic bank and Figure 13 lists the key characteristics of each fund model.Figure 13: Main characteristics of EE Fund models
Based on the new Energy Efficiency Law, the Government plans to establish soon an Energy Efficiency 
Fund, which shall function as a legal entity, having the status of a non-profit organization. The Energy 
Efficiency Fund shall be governed by a Board of Trustees with members representing MIE and other 
Ministries engaged in the improvement of energy efficiency in the areas under their responsibility. Each of 
the Fund models presented above can potentially stimulate EE investments. However, these models have 
different impacts in terms of their ability to mobilize new investment, make efficient use of the Fund’s 
capital and ensure the sustainability of the Fund’s operation. Some advantages and drawbacks of Fund 
models are listed in Table 9.
Guarantee Fund
•Fund provides a guarantee for all 
or part of the loans given by 
commercial banks to loan users
•Lower risk for commercial banks 
results in better loan terms and 
conditions 
•Repayment from the Fund to the 
banks depends on loan users’ 
behaviour 
•High investment to fund costs 
ratio (usually 4 to 1) 
•Advantage: Experience with 
guarantee funds in most of Energy 
Community Countries (and in New 
EU MS)
Interest rate deduction / 
Investment deduction
•Fund pays full or part of loan 
interest rate costs or pays part of 
the investment
•Lower loan costs improve project 
economic performance 
•Interest rate payment or 
investment deduction decreases 
Fund assets 
•Disadvantage: Repayment and 
grace period are often more 
relevant than interest rate or 
investment
•Advantage: Interest rate is higher 
in Albania, thus reduced interest 
rate may make for attractive 
loans;
•Lack of equity fiancing may make 
loans attractive due to investment 
deduction
Direct funding 
•Fund gives preferential loans to 
the users directly (reduced 
interest rate, longer repayment 
period, longer grace period)
•Better loan conditions can be 
provided 
•Fund gathers and evaluates loan 
applications 
•When loans are reimbursed the 
Fund can be used again
•Funds for environmental 
protection, EE and RES can be 
combinedHowever, if the annual income of the EE Fund is secured by energy and environmental taxes, then the 
sustainability of the Fund’s operations can be achieved. Based on the advantages and drawbacks of fund
options presented above, the following actions are recommended for the EE Fund development.
 Begin by providing loan guarantees, so that by reducing the risk exposure of the Fund, higher 
external investments can be attracted.
 Determine the Fund models to be used for different investment projects, according to the type 
of projects, the level of investment and the type of client. 
Table 9: Advantages and Drawbacks of Energy Efficiency Fund Models
Fund 
model
Advantage Drawback
Loan 
Guarantee
● Provide funding for EE investments that are not 
financially viable under current loan conditions
● Reduced risk of non-repayment helps projects to 
receive better loan conditions from the 
commercial banks
● High guarantee to loan ratio and mobilization of 
high external investments for the projects 
● Possible support to development of EPC/ESCO 
industry 
● Guarantee can be used again for new loans, once 
current loans are repaid
● If failure to repay loans by borrowers is higher than 
expected, the Fund’s resources could be used more 
rapidly than planned and its ability to support new 
loans diminished
● Certain borrowers may not meet the loan standards 
of the Fund and hence not qualify for financing
● If the Fund charges a fee for its guarantee, these costs 
might be passed on to the borrower, thereby 
increasing total loan costs 
Interest 
Rate / 
Investment 
deduction 
payment
● Reduced cost of borrowing will increase the 
feasibility of projects
● The Fund benefits from the commercial banks’ 
client portfolio and expertise
● Limited or no exposure of the Fund to borrower 
credit risk
● Interest rate / investment deductions will reduce 
the Fund’s capital until it is depleted
● If investment deduction is applied, the Fund 
resources will be spent faster, leaving no resources 
for other projects 
● Does not address essential risks the banks may 
perceive in making loans 
● Very limited benefit for small investments
Direct 
Loans
● Fund provides loans at more favourable and 
flexible terms than those offered by the 
commercial banks
● Fund is the last alternative for some projects that 
cannot get financing from commercial banks 
● Fund may give loans to projects being implemented 
on an EPC/ESCO basis, supporting developing of 
this new business model
● Once loans are repaid, funds can be used to finance 
new projects (i.e. act as a revolving fund)
● Significant costs associated with staff training and 
Fund operation (since the Fund acts as a bank)
● Potential legal obstacles for establishing and running 
such a fund
● Fund bears all credit risks 
● If the Fund’s capital is fully distributed then no 
resources will be available to make new loans for 
other projects until the first repayments have been 
collected  Utilize interest rate payment reductions, because the benefits for smaller investments are low. 
 Utilize investment deductions with caution, particularly if the annual income of the Fund is not 
secured since this option spends the Fund’s resources the fastest.
 Build up a capability to offer direct loans over the medium-term, cooperating where possible 
with similar existing state institutions such as a Guarantee Fund, or a Development Fund.
 Draft eligibility and evaluation criteria for investments to be supported by the Fund for prescreening of potential projects and to ensure that the development of selected projects helps 
the Fund achieve its priorities.
 Prepare promotion of the Fund among target groups to bring together all potential partner 
organizations (commercial banks, project developers, clients-investors) that may wish to 
cooperate with or capitalize the Fund in future.
 Evaluate cooperation alternatives with external financiers and identify how the Fund, partner 
institutions and clients can benefit from such cooperation.
3.10.3 SUPPORT ENERGY EFFICIENCY MECHANISMS IN BUILDINGS SECTOR
BUILDING EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS 
Support mechanisms to improve energy efficiency in the buildings sector are different for public buildings, 
commercial buildings and households. Taking into account the mechanisms applied in EU Member States, 
the following suggestions could be used for Albania: 
 In additions to EE Fund it is very important to investigate other financing mechanisms, including 
preferential loans, grants, subsides and third party financing, which are recommended rather than 
fiscal mechanisms; 
 Financing of energy efficiency measures in central and municipal public buildings should be 
organized by the government in close collaboration with local authorities. Improvements in the 
energy efficiency of public buildings and public street lighting may be financed from grants that are 
still provided by IFIs and PPP model/ESCO projects. Grants and soft loans should be sought from 
IFIs for specific activities. PPP model/ESCO projects typically include detailed energy auditing, 
technical design, implementation and monitoring and verification of the results (energy and cost 
savings, cost and energy indicators); Also, 
 Improvements in the energy efficiency of commercial buildings should be financed by preferential 
loans from existing guarantee funds such as the EBRD Sustainable Energy Fund (SEF) Programme 
(under Western Balkan Sustainable Energy Programme). Implementation of Western Balkans 
Green Economy Financing Facility (WB GEFF - Residential) in the Western Balkans, focusing on 
the residential sector through the EBRD is supporting Residential sector with grants for all 
projects that reach 20% energy savings or 20% reduction of CO2 emissions. Albania will be 
included in this scheme during the year 2017 and the program will continue until 2020. Energy 
audits and technical advice are already granted from EBRD Western Balkan Sustainable Energy 
Direct Financing Facility (WeBSEDFF) program through financial support provided by the 
EBRD/EU;
 Some external financing for commercial building energy efficiency is also available in the form of 
preferential loans (which include incentive payments) combined with technical assistance energy audits provided free of charge for the borrower) launched by IFC, GGF and from private banks 
with their internal funds;
 Financial support to improve the energy efficiency of households should combine awareness, 
technical advice and information, and preferential loans for EE investments from an established 
list. 
 Financing of low income households should focus on low cost measures and technical advice which 
will be subsidized either from a state budget allocation or from local authority budgets and by 
redirected subsidies from energy utilities to end-users; 
SOLAR WATER HEATING INCENTIVES
The following financial and fiscal measures for promotion of solar hot water technologies should be further 
investigated and recommended to be followed to maintain the momentum of such technology use in 
residential, commercial and public buildings as well as in some industrial sectors.
 Exempt producers of solar thermal systems from the customs duties and VAT for these solar 
water heaters.
 Reimburse producers or assemblers of the solar water heating systems providing sanitary or 
technological hot water the customs duties paid for the raw materials imported for actually 
assembling or producing solar water heating systems. The Council of Ministers, upon the proposal 
of Minister responsible for energy, shall approve the rules and procedures for governing 
reimbursement of such customs duties.
 The Council of Ministers, upon the proposal of the Minister responsible for energy, shall 
determine the economy sectors and the categories of buildings, the minimum area or the capacity 
of the solar water heating systems, technical requirements of solar water heating systems to be 
installed as well as the specific procedures and criteria to be followed regarding the enforcement 
and monitoring of such an obligation by the responsible institutions.
3.10.4 SUPPORT ENERGY EFFICIENCY MECHANISMS IN INDUSTRY SECTOR
The only grant program available for the industry sector is managed by EBRD (WeBSEDFF) with a grant 
level up to 20% of the loan amount required, and Albania is part of this scheme since 2010. IFIs usually 
extend loans to local Participating Banks which then provide loans to private sector companies for 
industrial energy efficiency projects. In Albania, the new EE Law defines an ESCOs role, and the 
Government support to ESCOs, based on new secondary legislation that will be prepared during 2018
and will assign their development to the private sector only. 
3.10.5 SUPPORT OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY MECHANISMS IN TRANSPORT SECTOR
On average in the EU, half of the measures in the transport sector are directly targeted at cars and that 
share rises to 60% if measures on fuel substitution (e.g. on the promotion of biofuels) are also included. 
Only a limited number of measures address freight transport, despite it being the transport mode with 
the most rapid increase in energy consumption in last decade. Two-thirds of national measures target 
improvement in the efficiency of -or reduction of CO2 emissions from - new cars, with financial incentives 
to purchase more efficient/low emission new cars being the most common measure. Based on the 
experience of new and old EU Member States discussed above, and different financial and fiscal mechanisms, the following are recommendations that can be implemented in Albania and can bring 
significant EE improvements in the transport sector: 
 Require Vehicle Technical Centers (VTCs) to provide strict and regular technical testing, including 
measurement of air pollutant and CO2 emissions, for all categories of cars and freight transport. 
These VTCs will be useful for governments in preparing taxes related to energy efficiency and 
forecasting of transport energy use and in providing a realistic basis for target setting and effective 
regulation.
 Develop measures for a purchase tax and annual tax on cars and other vehicles should be linked 
to energy efficiency performance. It will be useful to study the example of the French government, 
which has taken innovative action in this area by setting up a combined subsidy and tax scheme, 
with a subsidy for low emission cars (i.e. <130g CO2/km) and a tax on cars with high emissions 
(i.e. above 161g CO2/km). 
 Establishment and implementation of EE criteria in procurement of state and municipality vehicles 
and transport services. 
 Another measure to be developed for the medium-term is the introduction of road charging. 
Road charges for heavy goods vehicles are already in place in many EU countries. The German 
Toll Collect system is an innovative system that uses satellite-guided systems rather than 
conventional tolls and links road charges to the vehicles’ emissions factor. The toll revenues are 
used to subsidize rail and water transport infrastructures. 
3.11 ELECTRICITY TARIFF REFORM 
3.11.1 LONG-TERM STRATEGY
The long term tariff strategy for the Albanian power sector should take account of the following 
interconnected features. 
 The evolution of the power market in Albania, particularly the creation of a competitive wholesale 
and retail market which will require legally, functionally and financially separate transmission and 
distribution entities.
 Abandoning price regulation in the wholesale market (including through PSO), and continue with 
deregulation of the public generation according to the Power Sector Law
 The insolvency of the entire Albanian power sector and the importance of restoring it to solvency 
over time to avoid the need for government subsidy.
 The priorities for development of the sector and in particular the enhancement of the role of 
renewable energy through the development of small scale hydro, wind and solar PV capacity in 
order to meet EU and national priorities and sustainability.
 The priorities for development of the sector and in particular the enhancement of consumer
benefits in terms of securing supply of electrical power and quality of service.
 The development of sustainable tariff reforms in order to protect especially vulnerable customers
as well as to increase the efficiency of the electrical power system of Albania. The integration of the Albanian power market with the regional market, and later with the 
European power market in compliance with the acquis. 
3.11.2 POWER MARKET EVOLUTION
Significant changes in the power market will create a regional market for power generators, with all 
generation passing through the market. Albania will have improved insurance against dry years when hydro 
generation falls below normal levels, providing greater consistency in costs between wet and dry years as 
the regional market improves price stability for generation. KESH is likely to become significantly more 
profitable, especially in wet years, by selling into a regional market against higher cost thermal generators. 
The extent to which KESH can become profitable depends partly on how much electricity it can sell to 
the market and how much (if any) it is obliged to sell under the public service obligation. The overall 
impact on Albania and the extent of imports and exports are also uncertain and will depend on both the 
evolution of the market and power sector investment decisions in both Albania and the countries with 
which it trades power.
3.11.3 SECTOR INSOLVENCY
The insolvency of the Albanian power sector is quite severe. It stems in large part from the performance 
of the distribution company OSHEE since there are excessive technical and non-technical losses in the 
distribution sector and inadequate collection of cash from customer bills. In principle, this problem can be 
addressed by significant financial injections from the Government, by policy and other reforms to improve 
the financial performance of sector entities or by a combination of these two approaches. Given that
government finances are very tight and policy reforms would be needed to complement any financial 
injections in order that such injections were not required regularly. Therefore, the focus should be on 
initiatives that can improve financial performance through initiatives in the sector that do not require 
government funding or an expectation of any other external finance. 
Reforms implemented by the Albanian government in 2014, improved the ability of OSHEE to collect 
overdue debts accrued over the years. Moreover, it decreased non-technical losses of power in the local 
grid due to the unlawful interventions of third parties. Specifically, the amendments of the Albanian 
Criminal Code (Law n. 7895), in full force since September 2014 increased the legal responsibilities of any 
individual and/or legal entity unlawfully stealing electricity. The Government needs to continue to improve 
the financial solvency of the OSHEE and of KESH which will help promote important investments in the 
power sector. 
3.11.4 RENEWABLE ENERGY
The Government has committed to a policy of increasing the use of renewable energy, primarily 
hydropower, solar and wind, with small-scale hydropower having the highest priority. Methodologies for 
offering support schemes have been developed as part of this strategy and are described in the Technical 
Annex. At this stage they address general principles. However, the detail will need to be kept under review 
as the Albanian power market evolves. In particular:
 Government will ensure that the levels of all renewable energy sources generating electricity 
offered to the market are manageable within the framework of other electricity sources and the 
evolving market.  There is already extensive experience in commissioning small scale hydro projects through 
concession agreements. Such hydro projects are therefore likely to continue to be the main 
source of renewable energy projects, building on this experience. However, for solar and wind 
projects there is little previous experience. The Government has defined the FiT for solar, wind 
and biomass energy in order to promote the best site and in the same time help to reach the 
respective targets
 The development of a regional market is likely to lead to greater variation in prices over the day,
season (winter-summer) and the benefits of by optimizing the utilization of scale hydro projects 
with small solar photovoltaic and wind power plants to help balance intermittent solar and wind 
power will increase significantly benefits and the tariff policy should recognize this.
3.11.5 RETAIL PRICES AND TRANSMISSION TARIFFS
The developments discussed above will not affect the methodology for retail prices applied for electricity 
supply under public service and the role of the Universal Service Provider directly. However, there are 
potential significant implications as the market develops, generation tariffs are being deregulated, and 
increased renewable generation introduces greater uncertainty into estimating the level of generation. 
There are two broad areas in which changes are likely to be needed:
 Changes in retail Universal Service prices structure to respond to variations in generation prices
and make tariffs more cost reflective for that particular category of consumer.
 Actions by the system operator to incentivize short term management of the balance between 
supply and demand through a competitive balancing market.
For the system operator, OST, the new market arrangements will mean that balancing supply and demand 
becomes more complex. System operators have devised numerous ways of coping with the challenges 
arising from this complexity. The arrangements will depend on the characteristics of consumer demand 
on the Albanian system. The responsibility for devising innovative mechanisms for balancing demand will 
include balance responsibility and competitive balancing market, enforced and implemented by OST. 
However, the Government will want to ensure that the utilities are thinking ahead in devising new 
mechanisms and ensuring that the quality, economy and reliability of the power system are enhanced by 
them.
3.11.6 FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE ALBANIAN POWER SECTOR
Albania’s power sector has made financial and operational progress in recent years. Results for 2015-2016
suggest that all three major utilities were profitable and showed financial performance improvements 
compared to 2014. Supplies are generally reliable, although voltage sometimes drops to very low levels at 
the end of long distribution lines. However, the power sector faces three interconnected and major issues. 
These issues are only partly within the capacity of ERE as regulator to resolve. In particular, the 
Government, as owner of the main generation, transmission and distribution companies, has to exercise 
its ownership responsibilities more effectively in order to resolve these issues and create a more 
sustainable power sector.
The three core issues are firstly the insolvency of the sector, in particular the distribution company 
OSHEE, secondly excessive technical and non-technical losses in the distribution sector and thirdly 
inadequate collection of cash from customer bills. The reform implemented by the Albanian Governmentrecently in the power electricity sector aimed at collecting debts and enforcing the prevention of energy
non-payment11 by customers has had some impact, but the financial position remains difficult. The extent 
of the insolvency of the sector can be illustrated by the financial position of OSHEE, which had negative 
equity of over 55 billion ALL at the end of 2015 (Figure 14). This is an improvement as there was negative 
equity of over 71 billion ALL at the end of 2014 but it is uncertain whether this performance improvement 
can be sustained. Moreover, the financial data of the OSHEE balance sheet for the first semester of 2016 
made available online in its website12, shows a further improvement in the financial position of the company 
compared to 2015. 
The position of KESH is better in that its balance sheet appears solvent but the company has significant 
short term credits and loans, much of it in the form of an overdraft, amounting to over 44 billion ALL at 
the end of 2015. This is also an improvement on the 2014 position when short term credits and loans 
amounted to over 49 billion ALL but KESH would not be capable of repaying the overdraft and other 
short term debt in the near term. In principle an overdraft is repayable on demand by the bank and as a 
matter of principle the balance on the overdraft should reduce to zero at least once during each year. The 
overdraft is providing long term financing for the company’s operations. Similarly, the transmission 
company OST had trade receivables of 9.5 billion ALL in 2015 and 9.7 billion ALL in 2014, again showing 
a small improvement. These amounts are largely receivables due from OSHEE and are equivalent to over 
a year’s transmission revenue. This in turn damages the position of OST.
Resolving these issues can only be achieved over a period of time. There are manifold challenges in devising
a package of measures which will deliver improved performance while achieving political and social 
acceptability. Responses are required from both ERE and Government. These are necessary conditions 
for sectoral performance improvement. Their effectiveness can be enhanced by a number of further 
financial reforms to boost sector performance and by changes to the way the ERE reviews investment 
plans in order to make its role more manageable. The Government will work with ERE to develop a joint 
plan to carry out the reforms.
 
11 The available data shows decreased of the non-paid energy from 52% in 2013 to about 29.8% for the first six months 
of 2015.
12 http://oshee.al/rezultati-financiar-i-6-mujorit-i-2016-per-OSHEE/Figure 14: Institutional Arrangements in the Albanian Electricity Sector
Better management of losses and cash collection can lead to huge improvements in sector financial 
performance. Such improvements can be complemented by a number of other financial initiatives that will 
help to enhance performance further. The following activities would be clearly complementary to loss 
reduction initiatives:
 Developing a sector financial model.
 Reformulating the Universal Service Supplier responsibilities.
 Permitting the utilities to earn a higher rate of return on equity.
 Carrying out financial restructuring of each of the utilities to place them in a solvent position.
3.11.7 DEVELOPING FINANCIAL MODEL
At present Government and ERE do not have a comprehensive financial model to help inform decisions 
regarding the entire electricity sector. Government should create one interconnected model that 
connects the accounting structures of the three publicly owned utilities so that the overall financial 
implications of tariff and other regulatory and financial decisions can be evaluated quickly and easily. The 
model should cover all the interactions between the generation, transmission and distribution businesses so that, for example, the impact of an increased generation tariff on distribution tariffs and financing can 
be evaluated. It should also have the capacity to make forward projections so that the impact of investment 
programs and the evolution of the regional power market can be evaluated. It should enable the calculation 
of financial ratios such as the debt equity ratio, self-financing ratio and debt service coverage ratio. The 
model should enable both government and ERE to carry out evaluations of power sector finances.
3.11.8 UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPLIER RESPONSIBILITIES 
At present, the Universal Service Supplier (USS) responsibilities are a mechanism which enables certain 
categories of consumer to benefit from the availability of relatively less expensive power from regulated, 
state-owned hydro generation. In the past all consumers were beneficiaries, but the USS is being 
progressively withdrawn from high and medium voltage consumers as the power market evolves. 
Consumers connected to the distribution network at 10 kV and 6kV will cease to be eligible for supply 
by the USS on December 31, 2017. Thereafter, only low voltage (0.4 kV) households and eventually small 
enterprises will qualify to get supply service from USS. Nevertheless, the low voltage customers shall be 
eligible to switch to a competitive retail on their own accord.
Government, supported by ERE, will need to develop further and replace the USS responsibility with a 
clear government commitment to support alleviation of energy poverty for the socially vulnerable 
consumers rather than uniform support across customer classes at lower voltages. Once such customers 
are identified and the conditions are regulated and enforced, a lifeline tariff could be applied to the poorest 
consumers applying funds outside the electricity market (with no cross-subsidizing), with other consumers 
paying cost reflective tariffs. The Government will seek to define the criteria in a transparent manner. The 
financial impact of this on the responsible suppliers (i.e. OSHEE) would still need to be determined and 
such suppliers to be compensated without disturbing the electricity market or cost of supply to other 
consumers. 
3.11.9 RATE OF RETURN FOR KESH
The present tariff model only permits KESH to earn a return on its assets equivalent to the one-year 
government bond rate. This rate is likely to be too low for a power utility which requires long term finance 
for up to thirty years. In general, longer term debt commands a higher interest rate than short term 
money such as one year bonds. Equity rates of return are higher still. KESH is highly unlikely to be able to 
achieve adequate self-financing for its investment program unless it is permitted to earn an equity rate of 
return on at least some of its investment. This will continue to be an issue as long as KESH continues to 
sell some power to OSHEE under special arrangements and outside the market. Once all power passes 
through the market it will cease to be an issue.
3.11.10 FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING
At some point a substantial sector financial restructuring is likely to be required to place all power 
companies on a sustainable basis. This may for example require the write off of some debt owed by OSHEE 
to KESH. The aim should be to place debt within the sector on a sustainable and commercial basis. This 
sort of restructuring is only worthwhile if the various parties are required to operate on a commercial 
basis in the future. Thus, current interventions such as the government requirement that OSHEE only 
needs to pay 85% of the invoice for transmission tariffs from OST would have to be dropped. These sorts of interventions serve only to entrench mismanagement in the sector and have no role in a commercial 
power sector. 
3.11.11 IMPROVING MANAGEABILITY OF THE REGULATOR’S ROLE
At present ERE tries to review tariff applications against very tight time deadlines. ERE could discharge its 
responsibilities more effectively if the submission of tariff applications was separated from the submission 
of investment plans for transmission and distribution. Investment plans could be submitted at a different 
time of year and developed more thoroughly in a way that would enable ERE to review the plans more 
effectively and approve investment with more confidence. There are already requirements for the 
transmission and distribution companies to produce ten and five year investment plans respectively and 
this requirement should be enforced within the next year. 
ERE should develop formats and timetables for the separate submission of investment plans by the 
transmission and distribution utilities. Government will also benefit from this initiative as it will enable 
government, as owner of the companies, to scrutinize their plans more closely. The plans should 
demonstrate that the companies have the financial and operational capacity to carry out the proposed 
investment plans and be realistic in the light of performance in previous years. 
The steps required to implement the program described above and possible timings are outlined in Table 
10. It is assumed that there will not be any government cash injection to the sector.
3.11.12 EXPERIENCE WITH FEED-IN TARIFFS FOR RES TECHNOLOGIES
The electricity tariffs for qualifying RES generators needs to reflect the cost of service, and the 
recommended strategy for a support schemes according to the RES Law and the respective Council of 
Ministers Decisions for Small Hydro Power Plans (SHPPs), Photovoltaic Power Plans (PvPPs) and Wind 
Power Plans (WPPs). Tariff setting process is based on a number of important documents: a) Existing 
structure of electricity tariffs; b) RES Targets for the period 2014-2020 and the impact of RES- support 
schemes for average electricity tariffs; and c) Qualitative analysis of year 2015 on costs and average tariffs.

of countries in the E&E region. Of the nine countries studies all use feed-in tariffs as support mechanisms 
except one, where tradable green certificates are being used. The regime of tradable certificates was
included in the review as it offers valuable insights to the set-up of alternative support mechanisms. All 
regimes are a market based support schemes systems. In addition to the obligation of connecting RES 
generators, most support systems also require suppliers or grid operators to purchase RES generated 
electricity based on the purchase supporting obligation scheme of RES-e generation. 
3.11.13 PROPOSED SUPPORT METHODOLOGY FOR RES PLANTS 
The new RES Law specifies that a support schemes system will be introduced that takes into account the 
type of technology and efficiency of generating equipment. The new RES Law also provides other incentives 
such as:
 Establishment of a national RES target in the total energy final consumption;
 Obligatory connection to the transmission or distribution networks;
 Payment only of the direct costs of connection to the electricity transmission or distribution 
networks;
 Long-term (15 years) power purchase agreements for the electricity produced from Priority 
RES power plants up to 15 MW installed capacity will remain the same. However, the support 
scheme will be based on a contract for differences. ERE will prepare the respective secondary 
legislation for their implementation.
 Obligatory off-take of the electricity produced from Priority RES power plants
In addition, all RES plants with installed capacity higher than 2 MW will now have balancing responsibilities. 
As a result of these measures, interest in RES power plants has grown considerably and new plants have 
started to be constructed – initially small hydropower and photovoltaic power plants, which are the bestknown and available technologies. In addition, several investors have started to request authorizations 
for wind turbines as well as biomass power plants.
A key component of the new RES law is a new tariff methodology which is the result of a study ERE had 
undertaken in June 2017 to define the most appropriate methodology. Because the private sector has 
been identified as the key player in the development of the RES sector, the focus of the methodology was 
to consider the rate of return on the project from the viewpoint of the private investor. Hence the study 
came to the conclusion that the result of a long run marginal unit cost (LRMC) analysis should be the basis 
on which the feed in tariff for each type of qualifying RES power plant must be based. The study concluded 
that: 
 The EU targets for renewable energy share can only be met by a significant share of new SHPPs, 
the utilization of solar energy for providing heat and electricity, traditional and new industrial 
biomass resources, and wind power plants, which requires mobilization of the private sector.
 The level of investment needed will requires considerable involvement from private investors 
who are looking for an attractive rate of return on their investment.
 Given the current market conditions: 7-10 years loan maturity, 2 years grace, a rate of return 
on equity 15-16% should make an investment attractive to this sectorThe new RES Law requires the Council of Ministers to approve, based on the proposal of ERE, the 
methodology for establishing the support schemes for Priority Producers of SHPPs, PvPPs, WPPs, BioGas 
PPs. It is important that the methodology (i) allow the recovery of the investments in the installation using 
the currently available renewable energy technology with reasonable profit, (ii) determine the maximum 
installation size for each type of qualifying RES technology, (iii) determine the total installed capacity for 
each type of RES technology that will benefit from the support schemes, (iv) take into account the social 
and economic impacts of the support scheme on consumers, (v) include an indexation formula to cover 
inflation for each year, and vi) establish a formula for the calculation of any additional RES Surcharge on 
end-user’s electricity price for all electricity consumers in Albania. 
The new RES Law specifies that the support will be given under a contract for differences (CfD) that 
provides a variable premium calculated as the difference payment between an administratively prefixed 
price (the strike price) and a measure of the market price for electricity (the reference price).
 The strike price (support schemes level) has to be calculated in such a way as to make a 
significant volume of a particular renewable energy technology economically viable and as such 
incentivize investment decisions. The reference price is a price which is based on Albanian Power 
Exchange (APEX) price or before on comparable wholesale market price in a given period. To 
ensure that the renewable energy producers are not being overcompensated, the off-takers are 
obliged to pay the difference between the reference price and the strike price to the CfD. 
 Financial support under a contract for difference (CfD) and the level of such support is in 
principle to be determined via a competitive, non-discriminatory bidding process (auction) to 
become a qualified producer of electricity from renewable energy sources. 
 CfD’s will have a duration of 15 years.
The relationships among and the role of market participants in the physical operation of the Market Model 
are defined by agreements between the individual participants and the Albanian Power Exchange (APE) 
and TSO, or regulated through applicable standard bilateral agreements. All RES power plants are divided 
in two groups: all RES plants with installed capacity lower than 2 MW will not have any balancing 
responsibility; and all RES plants with installed capacity greater than 2 MW will have balancing 
responsibility. Any fine/fee/penalty that will be imposed for not meeting balancing responsibility and how 
it will be decided under draft RES Law by Decision of Council of Ministers, which will be needed to be 
drafted and approved for practical implementation of the APE and future RES Law requirements. The 
Technical Annex provides detailed proposals for the methodology of calculating strike price for specific 
RES technologies. Table 11 presents the strategic recommendation to be taken into consideration during 
the calculation of supporting scheme based on the new RES Law.Table 11: Main Technical and Financial Parameters to be taken into Consideration for the RES Support Scheme

8 Weighted Average Capital Cost (WACC) consider in the calculation of FiT for RES WACC should be at least 15-16%. 
This value is considered the minimum for all RES scheme in general. PV power plants in particular will be financed from 
developer equity (banks in Albania are requiring 40-50% of total investment) and banks loans) the remaining 50-60% of 
total investment) based on the Project Financing Concept. So, in order to convince the Financial Institutions during the 
initial years of the FiT, the allowed WACC needs to be higher than 15-16%.
9 Duration of the incentive: According to Concession Law related to the support scheme, the applicable promotion 
scheme consists of the Public Supplier (OSHEE) entering into a fifteen (15) year power purchase agreement with all 
Priority RES Plants admitted to the support scheme, pursuant to which OSHEE purchases electricity at feed-in tariffs. .
10 Indexation of CoD: FiTs are annually adjusted according to inflation for new power plants. Once the CoD was awarded 
to a specific facility, there is no longer indexed. ERE has decided to index the yearly CoD with inflation index HICP 
according to the NACE Rev2 and published from EUROSTAT
11 Allocation of network investment costs: 
The Albania grid code currently allows 
the cost of deep network connections to 
be charged to the developer, which 
increases the project costs and has a 
negative impact on the investor returns. 
The RES law provides that Priority RES 
Generators should pay only of the direct 
costs of connection to the electricity 
transmission or distribution networks, 
while the upgrade of the network is a 
responsibility of both system operators. 
ERE should improve the transmission 
and distribution codes in order to 
include practical rules for the 
implementation of this measure. 
Allocation of network investment 
costs: The Albania grid code 
currently allows the cost of deep 
network connections to be charged 
to the developer. This approach 
increases the costs especially for 
SHPPs less than 2 MW and has a 
negative impact on the investor 
returns and interest.

increases the costs for WPP 
developers and has a negative impact 
on the investor returns and interest.
12 Licensing procedures: Licensing procedures are almost the same for medium RES (>2MW) and very small one like Solar 
PV, SHPPs, WPPs (20-2000 kW) systems. This will require a lot of preparatory work (and respective investment will be 
increased) and FiT should be impacted. In order to reduce the investments required in preparatory phase the licensing 
procedures need to be simplified especially for small Solar PV, SHPPs and WPPs less than 2000 kW.3.12 ALIGNING ALBANIAN ENERGY LEGISLATION WITH ENERGY COMMUNITY AND EU 
DIRECTIVES 
Albania’s energy sector is governed by primary and secondary legislation. In line with its commitments 
under the Energy Community acquis and as part of its strategic objective to accede to the EU, the 
Government of Albania has worked to align its legislation with the legal framework of the EU. The 
government aims to establish clear and transparent responsibilities for the implementation of the Acquis. 
Legislation and regulations in the energy sector fall under four major categories: primary legislation, 
secondary legislation, international agreements and EU directives.
3.12.1 PRIMARY LEGISLATION
Relevant primary legislation includes the Power Sector Law No. 43/2015, the Natural Gas Sector Law No. 
102/2015, the Energy Efficiency Law No. 124/2015, the Renewable Energy Sources Law No. 8/2017, the 
Law No. 68/2012 “On Information of the Consumption of Energy and Other Resources by Energy-Related 
Products”, and the Law on Energy Performance of Buildings No. 116/2016 And the Law on biofuels in 
transport (2008).
3.12.2 SECONDARY LEGISLATION (BY-LAWS) 
The Albanian Government, MIE and ERE are reviewing the secondary legislation in power sector, with 
the aim of putting them in line with the requirements of the new Power Sector Law. The secondary
legislation subject to review are provided below. 
Government decisions:
 The DCM no 52, dated 25.01.2017 “On the approval of the procedure for authorization of 
construction the direct lines”, was approved by the Albanian Council of Ministers in January 2017.
 The DCM no.16, dated 11.01.2017 “On the approval of the procedure for authorization of 
building new interconnectors”, was approved by the Albanian Council of Ministers in January 2017.
 The Decision of the Council of Ministers (DCM) no. 519, dated 13.07.2016 “On the approval of 
the Market Model of the Power Sector”, was approved by the Government in July 2016. This 
DCM sets out the steps that the Government is taking in the process of transitioning the vertical 
integrated structure of the electricity sector, towards a structure with legally, functionally and 
financially separate generation, transmission and distribution entities. In addition, it specifies the 
political objectives of the Government to the process of privatization in the power sector and its
harmonization with EU power sector directives. Moreover, this market model aims at developing 
an electricity market according to clear market rules and grid codes as the minimal technical 
requirements for efficient power system operation. Notwithstanding, the new market model will 
be implemented once the establishment of the Albanian Power Exchange, which is still pending, 
has been achieved.
 According to DCM no. 449, dated 15.6.2016 “On the approval of terms and procedures to appoint 
the last resort supplier (LRS) of power electricity”, the LRS appointed by ERE will be obliged to 
supply customers with electricity in case where the previous supplier becomes insolvent or 
subject to bankruptcy proceedings, or the license of the previous supplier has been revoked or 
suspended, or where it is impossible for the customer to find a supplier within the local market. On 7 July 2016 by its decision no. 155, ERE appointed OSHEE as the new LRS for an initial period 
starting from 07.08.2016, up to 31.12.2016. Such period was further extended by ERE until end 
of June 2017.
 The DCM no. 317, dated 27.4.2016 “On the appointment of the public authority which represents 
the state stakeholder’s rights in the share capital of the public owned companies acting in the 
power sector”, was approved by the Government in April 2016. This DCM sets out MIE as the 
public authority entitled to represent the state interests in the share capital of the public owned 
companies KESH and OShEE, and specifies the Ministry of Economic Development, Tourism and 
Trade as the entity that represent the state stakeholder’s rights in the share capital of OST.
 The DCM no. 244, dated 30.3.2016 “On the approval of the public service obligation to the 
licensed operators which generate, transmit, distribute and supply the electricity”, sets out the 
terms and conditions that the operators, licensed in the power sector to generate transmit and 
distribute electricity, must comply with in order to offer these public services. The decision was 
amended in December 2017 transferring the right to establish the selling price from KESH to 
OShEE to the Shareholder’s Assembly of KESH.
 The DCM no. 27, dated 20.1.2016, “On the National Renewable Energy Action Plan 2015 – 2020”, 
was approved by the Albanian Council of Ministers in January 2016.
 DCM no. 822, dated 7.10.2015 “On approval of the regulation for procedures of granting 
permits/authorizations for the construction of new power generation plants/facilities not subject 
to concession” as amended, sets out the necessary procedures and documents for application, 
evaluation and granting of an authorization for building a new power generation capacity that is 
not subject to concession. It repealed the outdated DCM no. 1701, dated 17.12.2008, enacted 
according to the abrogated power sector law no. 9072, of 2003.
 The DCM no. 125, dated 11.02.2015 “On the approval of the financial recovery plan in the power 
electricity sector”, was approved by the Government in February 2015. 
 On December 7, 2016 the Government approved DCM no. 848 “On the incorporation of the 
new joint stock company ALBGAZ Sh.A and the appointment of the public authority which 
represents the state stakeholder’s rights in the share capital of the public owned companies
ALBPETROL Sh.A. and ALBGAZ Sh.A.”. This DCM authorizes the spinoff of the gas unit within 
the company ALBPETROL Sh.A., and incorporation of a new independent entity in the form of a 
joint stock company namely ALBGAZ Sh.A to be owned 100% by the State. It is projected that 
such new entity will serve simultaneously as a combined transmission system operator and supply 
system operator of natural gas in Albania. According to the DCM, MIE is appointed as the public 
authority which represents the state stakeholder’s rights in the share capital of ALBPETROL Sh.A. 
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economy, Tourism, Trade and Entrepreneurship is appointed 
to represents the state stakeholder’s rights in the share capital of ALBGAZ Sh.A. Art. 7 of this
DCM sets out the obligation of the new entity ALBGAZ Sh.A. to apply to ERE for the certificate 
of the transmission system operator according to Art. 37 of the Natural Gas Sector Law No. 
102/2015. In addition, it is required to obtain the license of the combined system operator of 
natural gas pursuant to the procedures of Art. 22, 23 and 24 of the same law. 
Other relevant legislation connected or related to the energy sector: Amendment of the Law on Concessions and Public Private Partnership No. 77/2015, was 
approved by the Albanian parliament in July 2015. It provides for liberalization of the energy 
market, increases competition, and encourages the development of renewable resources as well 
as the attraction of foreign investments. Specifically, the amendments of this law exclude the 
applicability of the concession and Public Private Partnership (PPP) tender procedures for the 
construction and operation of renewable energy sources up to 2MW according to the Law on 
Renewable Energy Sources No. 138/2013. 
 DCM no. 575, dated 10.07. 2013 “On approval of evaluation rules and award of 
concessions/public-private partnership” defines the detailed procedures and requirements for the 
evaluation and award of concession applications for hydropower plants.
 DCM no. 416, dated 13.05.2015 “On approval of the general and special conditions, accompanying 
documents, term of validity, application forms for authorization and permit, procedures 
for the revision of decision-making process and permit authorization forms for the use of water 
resources”, defines the specific conditions and procedures for reviewing and decision-making to 
grant an authorization or permit for use of water resources, including the use of water for 
construction of hydropower plants.
3.12.3 INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION 
In 1997, Albania ratified the Energy Charter Treaty and the Protocol on Energy Efficiency and Related 
Environmental Aspects (PEEREA), which committed the government to draft and implement policies for 
improving energy efficiency and reducing the negative environmental effects of the energy system. The aim 
of PEEREA is that contracting parties, including Albania, shall cooperate by assisting each other in 
developing and implementing energy efficiency policies, laws and regulations. In fulfilling its commitments 
under PEEREA, Albania presented a regular review of its energy efficiency policies in 2007.
The Energy Community Treaty (“ECT”) was approved by the Albanian Parliament in April 2006 (Law No. 
9501, dated 3.04.2006). It provides a legal framework for convergence with the EU’s energy acquis13. 
Being a contracting party to the ECT, Albania has made binding commitments to implement the relevant 
EU Acquis on energy, environment, RES and competition and to promotion of investments, statistics, and 
social policy. Albanian authorities have explicitly acknowledged that energy efficiency and renewable 
energy deployment have the potential to bring benefits to the local consumers, reduce emissions and 
contribute to security of supply. Energy security, sustainable development and international obligations 
are identified as the main drivers of energy efficiency policies with competitiveness, employment, comfort 
and climate change providing further incentive to the energy sector at the national level.
3.12.4 ENERGY COMMUNITY LAW AND EU DIRECTIVE ALIGNMENTS
The status of alignment of the Albanian Energy Sector with the EU directives is summarized In Table 12.
 
13 The EU’s “acquis communautaire on energy” is defined in Annex I of the Energy Community Treaty and includes a number of EU Directives and Regulations that are core to 
the regulation of the energy sectors of EU member states.Table 12: Status of Albanian Energy Sector Alignment with EU Directives

3.12.5 ALIGNING ALBANIAN CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY WITH INTERNATIONAL AND EU DIRECTIVES
Albania is a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 
adopted at the “Rio Earth Summit” in 1992, which established the objective to combat climate change by 
stabilizing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere and limiting average global temperature increases to 
support sustainable development. The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015, provides a common 
framework for all Parties aimed at holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 
2° C above pre-industrial levels. To achieve such a long term goal, parties should aim to reach a global 
peaking of GHG emissions “as soon as possible”, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing 
country parties and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best science available, so 
as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the second 
half of this century. 
Based on the GHG Emissions Baseline Scenario and the Third National Communication and projections 
of the transport sector, assume that the energy demand for the Transport Sector will increase at the same rate as it was increasing since 2000. The potential measures for increasing energy efficiency, considered 
under the EE scenario and reduction of GHG to be considered are as follows:
1. Implementing EE Targets for transport sectors of Albania based on 2nd and 3rd NEEAP already 
approved;
2. Implementing RES Targets for transport sectors (especially focus on bio fuels to be consumed in 
this sector according to the respective targets) of Albania based on first RESAP;
3. Reconstruction of existing poor quality roads and construction of new roads; 
4. Road maintenance through public and private sector cooperation;
5. Increasing the share of public transport for passengers and freight transport (road, rail and 
waterways);
6. Increasing taxes for second hand category cars in order to reduce at maximum their introduction 
to Albanian market.
7. Promotion of an integrated intermodal transport system, which includes 
infrastructure/transportation by land and sea;
8. Further restructuring of the railway system, the creation of the Albanian Railway Authority, the 
reorganization of the Albanian Railways, through total separation of operating activities from 
management activities and infrastructure maintenance;
9. Intensification of work for the creation of an integrated system of transport, focused on the 
connection of ports of Durres, Vlora, and Shëngjini by rail;
10. Construction of an intermodal port in Shengjin, which will be one of the largest ports in the region, 
and will serve as a connecting point between the Adriatic Sea and other countries in central and 
eastern Balkan;
11. Construction of new tourist ports, equipped with the necessary infrastructure and modern 
logistics for this purpose;
12. Opening of the market and reducing the cost of travel fees for passengers, in order to increase 
the movement of passengers and goods; 
13. Promotion of investments based on public-private partnership for domestic tourism purposes;
14. Construction of a new airport in the south of the country;
15. Enhancing regional collaboration in the area of air transport;
16. Enable a better performance of air safety functions, as well as strengthening the administrative and 
technical capacity in this sector.
The Paris Agreement also aims to strengthen the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change 
while ensuring a sustainable, resilient and low carbon development through adequate finance flows. The 
support should be provided by developed countries Parties to developing countries with respect of both 
mitigation and adaptation, continuing the existing collective goal to mobilize USD 100 billion per year until 
2025 when a new collective goal will be set. 
In order to achieve the emission reduction objectives, the Agreement establishes a “bottom up system” 
where Parties will have to prepare and communicate successive nationally determined contributions 
(NDC) every five years with the aim of progressively improving their efforts.
In addition to their NDC, Parties should also formulate long-term, mid-century low GHG development 
strategies, and submit them by 2020 that demonstrate how their efforts will contribute to the goal of 
zero-net emissions by the second half of this century. Albania has signed the Paris Agreement on the 22nd of April 2016 in New York, and the agreement will 
enter into force after 55 countries that account for at least 55% of global emissions have deposited their 
instruments of ratification. 
The EU adopted the “Low-carbon Economy Roadmap14” in 2011 setting out a cost-efficient pathway to 
make the European economy more climate-friendly and less energy-consuming. The roadmap suggests 
that, by 2050, the EU should cut its emissions to 80% below 1990 levels. Milestones to achieve this are 
40% emissions cuts by 2030 and 60% by 2040. All sectors need to contribute to the low-carbon transition 
according to their technological and economic potential. The EU Low Carbon Economy Roadmap calls 
for actions in all main sectors responsible for Europe's emissions – power generation, industry, transport, 
buildings, construction and agriculture - and significant investments need to be made in:
 New low-carbon technologies
 Renewable energy
 Energy efficiency and 
 Grid infrastructure. 
Albania has started the process of changing the status from a developing country to a developed country, 
in the context of the UNFCCC. This process is an integral part of the process of integration into the 
European Union and involves the development of capacities at the national level for monitoring and annual 
reporting of Greenhouse Gases (GHG), the formulation and implementation of policies to reduce GHG 
and climate change adaptation, transposition and implementation of the European Union acquis on climate 
change. In line with the objectives of the EU 20-20-20, Albania has set quantitative targets related to 
energy efficiency (increase by 6.8%) and renewable energy sources (increase up to 38%) within the 
framework of Energy Community Treaty. These objectives are currently under review within the 2nd 
revision of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plans
In 2014 the Order of the Prime Minister No. 155, dated 25.04.2014 established an inter-ministerial 
working group on the coordination of the Ministries tasks, according to the country’s obligations on 
UNFCCC. The group, chaired by the Deputy Minister of Environment, includes the representatives of 12 
Albanian Ministries. The group has the mandate, among other things, to draft policies and strategies, 
ensure inter-institutional coordination for the implementation of climate change activities. In its first NDC, 
Albania has committing to reduce CO2 emissions by 11.5% in 2030 compared to the Baseline scenario. 
Further analysis of this area as well as targets and actions to be taken will be provided in the Integrated 
Energy and Climate Plan to be prepared together with the Energy Community Secretariat
3.12.6 MAIN FINDINGS TO ENERGY POLICIES AND KEY RECOMMENDATIONS 
In order to develop sustainable energy policies according to the needs of the country, international 
commitments, and the priorities of the Strategy, the Government is working to:
 
14 COM(2011) 112 final/2. Available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:5db26ecc-ba4e-4de2-
ae08-dba649109d18.0002.03/DOC_2&format=PDF Continue to implement a consolidated set of policies for energy efficiency and renewable energy
sources;
 Improve strategic planning for physical capacities, financial requirements and budgetary 
implications of the energy sector;
 Continue to secure the stability and reliability of the Albanian electricity system;
 Ensure that the goals of loss reduction and full bill collection are completed by OShEE;
 Recognize the current slow pace of reform and speed up the implementation of the energy acquis 
considering that faster implementation will facilitate much needed investments and influence the 
local market towards sustainable energy objectives;
 Ensure effective implementation of energy policy and legislation which needs to be further 
developed and implemented in practice. 
3.13 INTEGRATION INTO THE REGIONAL/EU ENERGY MARKETS
Integration into the regional and EU energy markets will be a crucial step for Albania to meet its growing
demand for energy. In 2014, total energy consumption in Albania was 2070 ktoe15. Electricity consumption 
was 7722 GWh, or 34 percent of primary energy use. With a projected annual GDP growth rate of 4%
for the coming decades, energy consumption is also expected to increase. In order for Albania to sustain 
its growth, the country will need to find additional sources of energy and invest in its energy transportation 
and delivery infrastructure. New energy sources and infrastructure investments will help Albania’s energy 
sector to continue its transformation towards a more competitive marketplace, while aligning with the 
Third Energy Package initiative and objectives.
Albania is one of the earlier Contracting Parties to have successfully achieved transposition of the Third 
Energy Package in 2015. As part of the Third Energy Package, emphasis on market opening and crossborder market integration are crucial steps towards a pan-European regional energy market.
3.13.1 ELECTRICITY SECTOR: MARKET INTEGRATION
Installed electricity generation capacity in Albania is 1.8GW, and hydropower plants provide most of the 
electricity. In the past, the hydropower production was sufficient to meet the domestic demands. 
However due to varying hydrological conditions, faster demand growth in contrast with a stagnation in 
new capacity installation since the 1990s and relatively high system distribution losses, the country has 
had to rely more on electricity imports to meet demand. Including losses, the total overall electricity 
consumption over the next decade is expected to increase by more than 33% over its 2014 level and will 
remain dominated by the residential consumption. 
Albania has adopted an Integrated Planning System (IPS) policy to provide operating principles for 
facilitating a coordinated and coherent government policy planning. One of the key features to IPS is the 
second National Strategy for Development and Integration (NSD-II) which describes the national social, 
 
15 Energy Balance of Albania 2009-2014, AKBN; INSTATdemocratic and economic development country’s objectives over the period 2015-2020. Some of strategic 
objectives in the NSDI-II for the electricity sector include:
 Increasing hydropower energy supply to 7,300 GWh/annum by 2020 (from 4,425 GWh in 2012),
 Reducing electricity losses in the distribution network to 14% by 2020,
 Reducing energy dependency in imports to 65% in 2020 (from 69.75% in 2015),
 Start operation on the second half of 2018 of the 400 kV interconnection line between Albania 
and Kosovo (completed in 2016) with the assistance of the Energy Community Secretariat and 
European Commission.
 Strengthen interconnection of electricity networks with Kosovo and Macedonia to improve the 
linkage of the Albanian energy system with the region. ,
 Aligning the electricity sector’s legal and regulatory framework with the EU Acquis and meeting 
the obligations of the Third Energy Package.
 Regional market coupling
In order to meet its obligations with the Third Energy package and further promote and sustain its 
economic development, Albania is taking steps to remain attractive financially and economically in the 
energy sector. While being one of the first Contracting Parties to begin transposing the Third Energy 
Package in the electricity sector, Albania’s electricity sector is characterized by a market structure in 
which most of the energy procurement is dominated by bilateral transactions for large customers, while 
most of the other customers and the retail market remains operated under a regulatory regime. Positively, 
the unbundling of operations and interests is underway, and the one positive aspect in the transmission 
ownership was adopted by law in 2016. 
OST, the certified transmission system operator central to the development of a robust market, is tasked 
to ensure quality development of the transmission grid, while ensuring transparent and non-discriminatory 
grid access for market participants. It must also coordinate the planning and development of the 
transmission network with counterpart companies in the region. As part of its effort to strengthen its 
transmission network, Albania has initiated several improvement projects within the country such as for 
the mid-term (2017-2021):
 Extension of Komani substation with 400/220 kV autotransformer 345 MVA and its connection 
to the grid.
 Construction of 400/110 kV Tirana3 Substations 2x150 MVA, Strenthening of 110 kV Tirana ring 
network and Construction of double circuit 220 kV line Tirana2 Ss- Rashbull Ss.
 Construction of 400 kV interconnection line Fier Ss - Elbasan2 Ss - Bitola Ss, rehabilitation of 
Elbasan2 Ss and extention of Fier Ss with 400/220 kV autotransformer 400 MVA.
 Construction of 220 kV line Burrel – Peshkopi and 220/110 kV Peshkopi Ss 120 MVA.
 Installation of a Shunt Reactor 400 kV, 120 MVAR in 400 kV Zemblak Ss busbars.
 Purchase and implementation of a new electronic platform for the energy Management
Long term plans for the transmission network will be prepared from OST by the end of 2018.
3.13.2 ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMPETITIVE DAY AHEAD ELECTRICITY MARKETThe integration of the Albanian electricity market to the European electricity market requires that a 
competitive wholesale and retail market should be established first in the country. The new Power Sector 
Law (PSL) provides a gradual opening of the retail market and establishment of an immediate competitive 
wholesale market. Based on PSL, a new Albanian Market Model was approved by the Council of Ministers. 
The development and approval of the Albanian Market Model (AMM) is the final step towards the 
development of the Albanian Electricity Market into a fully competitive power market in line with the 
Energy Community obligations. Closely linked to the previous two developments, a process towards the 
establishment of an Albanian Power Exchange (APE) has been initiated which also requires further 
alignment of the electrical power market in full compliance with the Energy Community. In addition to
allowing for further regional integration between Albania and its neighboring countries, the updated 
Albanian Market Model should encourage the following: 
 Higher consumer benefits in terms of securing supply of electrical power and quality service; 
 More efficient utilization of the cross-border trading between Albania and its neighboring 
countries allowing the Albanian power sector gain on their specific generation portfolio;
 The harmonization of the power legislation and market practice with the requirements of Energy 
Community Treaty; 
 Finalizing the move from the vertical integrated structure of the Electricity Sector towards a 
structure with legally, functionally and financially separate Supply, Generation, Transmission and 
Distribution entities allowing for competition in wholesale and retail markets; 
 The development of the electricity market according to clear market rules and grid codes as 
minimal technical requirements for an efficient operation of the Power System; 
 The implementation of third party access in order to participate in the electricity market and the 
creation of the conditions for the development of a transparent and non-discriminatory market; 
 The liberalization of the power market, creating structure that increases the interest and number 
of participants and opens the sector for competition and foreign participants and investors; 
 The monitoring of the electricity market by ERE; 
 The need to design and implement rules that provide for level-playing field for carrying out 
transactions in the markets, as well as market integrity regime to mitigate market manipulation, 
market abuse and insider trading in line with the European best practice; and
 The integration of the Albanian Electricity Market with the Regional Market in South East Europe, 
and later with the European Electricity Market to be a guiding design principle. 
The Albanian Market Model is characterized by a wholesale market based on bilateral transactions, while 
all the physical contracts are traded on an organized Day-Ahead and Intraday Market organized through 
the APE. The ERE, the Albanian Competition Authority and State Aid Commission shall, in coordination 
with the Energy Community Secretariat and in consultation with the market participants, make sure that 
appropriate and well-justified measures are taken for ensuring that the market performance satisfies the 
criteria of transparency and openness as well as security of supply. All forms of direct and indirect price 
regulation and subsidies will be removed except what is covered in any Public Service Obligation compliant 
with the Power Sector Law and Energy Community obligations. 
The implementation of the Albanian Market Model shall be enabled by the detailed market rules. Its 
implementation will also enable Albania to comply with the commitments already undertaken or may undertake in the framework of international and regional cooperation. The competitive market will also 
facilitate a future market coupling of Albanian market with other markets from neighboring countries. 
With regard to RES electricity producers, the Market Model is expected to support schemes in compliance 
with the relevant Energy Community acquis in the form of contracts for difference (CfDs) that will replace 
their current Power Purchase Agreements (PPA). 
3.13.3 BENEFITS OF A REGIONAL ELECTRICITY MARKET
Analysis of a coupled electricity market between Albania and Kosovo has been analyzed and shown to 
provide the following benefits:
 Improved security of electricity supply, as Albania has almost 100% hydro capacities (strongly 
vulnerable to variable hydrological conditions) and Kosovo has almost 100% thermal capacities 
(partly very old and inflexible). The combined generation capacity mix is approximately 50% hydro 
and 50% thermal, which is expected to improve security of supply through more efficient use of 
cross-border capacity and price signals. Based on the Memorandum of Understanding signed 
between Albania and Kosovo both power systems are going to operate as a single bidding zone 
and are going to establish the efficient market.
 Efficient use of cross-border capacity and increased welfare on both sides. 
 Improved power system control and system reserve synergies provided by the combination of 
thermal (base) and hydro (peaking) capacities.
 Improved investment climate to attractive potential generation investors.
The financial benefits associated with integrating the Albania and Kosovo electricity markets were 
quantified based on the savings that would come from the reduction of electricity imports and the 
additional variable O&M costs for Kosovo Thermal Power Plants and the Drin River Cascade HPPs. The 
savings from reducing imports greatly overshadows the incremental operating costs for both the thermal 
and hydropower plants, and the net financial benefit for both systems averages 75 million euros annually 
between 2017 and 2030, with a cumulative benefit of over 1 billion euro by 2030. 
In such an environment where system resources utilization and trading occur based on market-driven 
principles, Albania in the long term could attract further generation capacity investment in renewable 
energy given its hydropower potential, achieve a smarter diversity of supply sources through energy 
imports from other countries thermal generation, and improve its security of supply. From a transmission 
infrastructure standpoint, such endeavors require the development of transmission interconnection 
between the concerned countries. To that effect, the projects mentioned below can be seen as part of 
the process to further integrate Albania and other Contracting Parties within a larger regional electricity 
market system:
 Starting commercial operation of the 400KV interconnection line between Tirana2 (Albania) and 
Kosova B (Kosovo), which should increase the electrical energy exchange potential between the 
Albania and Kosovo up to 600 MW. This project was commissioned in June 2016. However, in 
order to make this line operational the recognition by ENTSO-E of Kosovo transmission system 
as a separate control area is needed. 
 Construction of a 400 KV interconnection line between Elbasan (Albania) and Bitola (Macedonia), 
which should increase the electrical energy exchange potential between Albania and Macedonia 
up to 600MW. This project should be operational by 2018.3.13.4 REGIONAL ELECTRICITY MARKET INTEGRATION STATUS
For Albania to take full advantage of the electricity market liberalization as directed in the Third Energy 
Package, additional steps towards its implementation are still needed. Some of the positive achievements 
to date include:
 April 2015 - Adoption of new power sector Law in transposition of the Third Energy Package. It 
transposes Directive 2009/72/EC and Regulation (EC) 714/2009
 April 2015 onwards – Participation in the Coordinated Auction Office of South East Europe with 
Montenegro
 October 2015 – Memorandum of Understanding on regional capacity coordination initiative with 
the TSOs of Kosovo, Greece, Macedonia, Turkey and Bulgaria.
 November 2015 onwards - Participation in the Coordinated Auction Office of South East Europe 
with Greece
 January 2016 – Adoption of the law enabling ownership unbundling of OST
 April 2016 – Signing of the WB 6 Memorandum of Understanding on regional electricity market 
development and establishing a framework for other future collaboration
 July 2016 – adoption of a set laws including:
 Albania market model: 
o will consist of a day-ahead market, intraday-day market, settlement functions and a 
balancing market
o will consider the coupling of the Albanian market with neighboring markets
 Price regulation phase out
 Action Plan for setting up power exchange (PX)
Secondary legislation remains to be fully enforced16, more specifically with respect to:
 Balancing: the actual real-time balancing mechanism is not market based. Further balance 
responsibility is not compliant with the acquis.
 Market Opening: full competitive market access on the retail markets is not expected before 2018
and will be performed in phases according to the voltage level
 Price Regulation: complete phase out is not expected before 2019,
 Public Service Obligations: compliant methodologies for operations have not been adopted nor 
implemented by ERE
 Eligibility: the distribution network tariffs are not cost-based relative to the voltage level and the 
conditions for supplier switching still need to be practically implemented,
 
16 Energy Community Annual Report (for the year 2016) Protection of Vulnerable Customers: rules on conditions for termination of the supply to this 
customer class are not developed.
3.13.5 PRIORITY ACTIONS
Although the approval of new Power Sector Law and Albanian Market Model are the right step towards 
implementation of EU acquis, a number of other activities are required to fully comply with them, which 
would enable further integration of the Albanian electricity market to the European market. These steps 
would include:
 Deregulation of wholesale prices and contracts (KESh –OShEE)
 Development and adoption of market rules, including market participation criteria, standard 
contracts, settlement rules, etc. for functioning of the day-ahead market;
 Revise grid codes reflecting the market developments;
 Adoption of the rules for security of supply;
 Development and adoption of transparent balancing mechanism with the final goal of establishing 
a competitive balancing market;
Full unbundling of distribution function from retail supply function to be actually carried out by OSHEE. 
The Law 43/2015 of 30.04.2015 in its Article 72 stipulates that the legal and functional unbundling of 
distribution from the supply activity should be finalised by 31 December 2017.
 The Distribution System Operator (DSO) prepared the unbundling plan and selected COM 
METODI S.P.A. as company as the consulting company for the unbundling process. The unbundling 
model was approved by the Supervisory Council of OSHEE S.A. with the Decision No 65 date 
19.12.2016 “On approval of the corporate model” and also by the Minister of Energy and Industry 
as the General Assembly of the Company. The functional unbundling of distribution activity from 
the supply one is in progress and will be finalized by the end of 2018. 
 Creation and training of the structure responsible for operating the day-ahead market;
 Revision of transmission and distribution tariff methodologies with the goal to create nondiscriminative access conditions for all market participants and enable both system operators to 
cover their reasonable costs of service;
 Gradual elimination of regulation of public generation price; 
 Development and adoption of rules for protection of customers interests, including specific rules 
for vulnerable customers;
 Strengthening of independence and market monitoring capacities of the ERE;
 Make the necessary amendments to Power Sector Law and to secondary legislation to enable 
market coupling of Albania with other markets from neighboring countries starting with Kosovo.
3.13.6 GAS SECTOR: MARKET INTEGRATION
The Western Balkan region can be described as a fragmented gas market made of individual markets, each 
with its own regulatory environment, and with little cross-border competitive transactions. These 
markets, initially established with the purpose of satisfying domestic needs, are in their current form an obstacle to achieving a regional market environment without significant reforms and additional 
infrastructure investment. More specifically, Albania has a small, isolated gas distribution system, which is 
not linked to international gas transmission systems.
Albania’s current gas market size remains one of the smallest in the Western Balkan region 15 million 
m3N (consumption in 2015). All of the indigenous production in the country, which has been in significant 
decline since the 1990s, is used to meet the national consumption, and the portion of energy consumption 
met by gas usage remains small. However, over the next couple of decades it is estimated that the total 
potential gas consumption in the country could reach 1.15 billion m3N by 2030 and 1.37 billion m3N by 
2040 (See Table 13) and current domestic reserves will be explored to meet the expected future needs.

d. Natural Gas Demand based on “Gas 
Promotion” Scenario – calculated based

The development of a gas market in Albania is a must and will allow the country to:
 Develop a policy for security of supply,
 Increase the number of participants in the local market
 Attract investments in the gas sector
 Improve retail market efficiency
 Improve system operations
 Become part of regional gas market
 Improve economic development with potential regional trading hub.
Successful gas market integration for Albania will require the development of a modern national gas 
network robust enough to satisfy projected consumption needs and meet European standards, and the 
inclusion of Albania as part of a sub-regional gas network allowing for infrastructure development targeting 
a larger sub-regional demand. While the former will ensure the delivery of gas to the local market and

the context of the Third Energy Package should provide Albania with reliable and competitive gas for its 
economy.
3.13.7 STATE OF THE MARKET: GAS MARKET INTEGRATION EVOLUTION IN ALBANIA
With the intent of establishing a sustainable gas sector and achieve the objectives cited above, the 
government of Albania has been working on the development of a Gas Master Plan18 of Albania. This study 
concluded that Albania can play a significant role in the development of a regional gas market while 
restoring and upgrading its national natural gas transmission and distribution system.
The natural demographics of Albania present a challenge to the development of a dense gas distribution 
network. The country consists of approximately 3,000 settlements with a small number of inhabitants per 
settlements, administered under 12 administrative counties, which are divided into 61 municipalities and
373 local government units (LGUs). As such attention must be put on how to best develop a national 
distribution system that can have reasonable economies of scale. 
Based on relevant criteria such as population density and distribution, the existence of anchor consumers 
(e.g. power sector, industrial users), the level of urbanization and the type of dwelling, the Gas Master 
Plan found that it is not possible for Albania to develop a national gas transmission and distribution 
network capable of covering all of its 373 LGUs while achieving significant economies of scale. 
Alternatively, the solution with the most economies scale achievement proposed for Albania is a gas 
transmission and distribution system that would allow the country to meet 77% of the potential national 
demand in 2020, growing to 82% of the potential gas demand by 2040. The proposed gas transmission and 
distribution network which includes 85 viable LGUs (i.e. viable coverage zone) covers 12% and 65% of the 
country’s area and population respectively.
3.13.8 STATUS OF A NATIONAL GAS TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK
In order to have access to the regional and European gas infrastructure, Albania needs to identify both 
legal works and infrastructure investments needed to gain that access. In September 2015, Albania 
adopted the new Law on Natural Gas Sector, which transposes provisions from the Third Energy Package. 
In December 2016, the Government of Albania decided to separate the gas activities from the existing oil 
& gas public company ALBPETROL, creating a new public company, ALBGAZ, with the goal to play the 
role of the combined operator of transmission and distribution. According to Directive 2009/73/EC, and 
the Albanian Law on Gas Sector, any gas TSO shall be fully unbundled from other activities, including
ownership unbundling. This means that the newly established company is required to be fully unbundled 
from the existing ALBPETROL to comply with the requirements of the new Gas Sector Law.
It is obvious that any investment in the gas transmission and distribution networks shall be conditioned by 
the natural gas demand in country. Challenges in gas sector include:
 
18 WBIF WB11-ALB-ENE-01 – Gas Master Plan for Albania & Project Identification Plan – Gas Demand and Supply 
Assessment Final Large investment needed for the development of the domestic gas system;
 Lack of a proper market-based environment for attraction of private investors in gas sector;
 Competitiveness of natural gas or the economics of fuel source switching;
 Complete market opening through the establishment of functioning traded markets;
 Market size and sustainability.
3.13.9 REGIONAL GAS MARKET CORRIDORS
Although facing low domestic production and with few economically explored reserves to meet its 
potential gas needs, Albania can take advantage of its geographical location within the Western Balkan 
region and become a key player in the development and deployment of a regional gas transmission 
network for a sub-regional market19. In addition to the establishment of a national gas transmission and 
distribution network, the possibility of a connection to a wider regional network offers Albania the 
opportunity to develop sustainable gas sector and become part of a more robust gas market. Development
of dual national and regionally connected gas network infrastructure provides Albania with more options 
towards building its natural gas supply portfolio while expanding its role as trading hub in the region.
Benefits for Contracting Parties26 are achievable through several market integration options aiming at 
establishing regional wholesale natural gas markets in South East Europe and Central East Europe 
(SEE/CEE) and their further integration in the European Union internal natural gas market. Based on 
feasibility criteria including gas sources, interconnection, gas hub, timescale and consumption, Albania was 
found to be a critical node in the establishment of two possible market integration options corridors in 
the South East Europe region, augmented by the development of LNG terminals. These strategic projects
include the Adriatic Integration Corridor and the Ukraine South Integration corridor.
The Adriatic Integration corridor consists of a market integration option that involves Albania and
Montenegro with Croatia, Italy, Greece, and Bulgaria. While it offers high potential to access different 
supply sources for the Contracting Parties along the Ionian and Adriatic Seas, this market integration 
option will only deliver its full benefits when all needed and planned infrastructure projects critical to its 
implementation are completed. From an Albania perspective, it is worth noting that this market integration 
option would solve the natural gas supply imbalance in the country, while allowing the country to become 
a natural trading hub for the region. 
On the implementation side, portion of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) is under construction. TAP’s 
route through Albania is around 271 kilometers, of which 211 kilometers is onshore and 60 kilometers is 
offshore. Some advantages of TAP for the region include:
 Independent, non-discriminatory and open for third parties and private investments,
 Deepening the diversification and security of gas supply in Europe,
 Potential for enlargement of new and additional projects,
 
19Energy Community Cross-Border Gas Market Integration Study – March 2016 Built-in concept of flexibility by construction of gas storage in Albania.
Similarly, the Ionian Adriatic Pipeline (IAP) project which aims at interconnecting the existing and planned 
gas transmission system of Croatia with the TAP. The project will make Albania the gateway for Caspian 
gas to enter the West Balkans. Some advantages of IAP for the region include:
 Diversification of gas supply in South East Europe,
 Providing access to future Croatian and Albanian gas storage capacities,
 Economic development in the West Balkan region,
 Trading hub role for Albania.
The Ukraine South corridor consists of a market integration option that involves Albania, Macedonia, 
Ukraine, and Moldova with Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania. Similar to the previous option, this market 
integration option will only deliver its full benefits when all needed and planned infrastructure critical to 
its implementation is completed. This market integration option would also solve the natural capacity 
supply imbalance in the country, while allowing the country to become a natural trading hub for the region. 
As mentioned previously, the market integration options described above are part of a gas infrastructure 
development framework that would benefit from additional gas supply projects in the form of LNG 
terminals recently considered and under construction. These LNG terminal projects have been found to 
benefit Albania and other Contracting Parties in the Western Balkans in key areas such as diversification 
and security of gas supply, greater gas integration of the SEE region and economic development.
 LNG Krk in Croatia: The Government of Croatia in June 2016 adopted the conclusion to speedup of activities on realization of construction of LNG terminal on the Island of Krk. LNG Croatia 
LLC has been appointed as the project developer.
 Expansion of LNG Revithoussa in Greece: Notice for an international tender for design and 
construction of a new LNG Tank in Revithoussa has already been published.
 Eagle LNG in Albania.
3.13.10 REGIONAL GAS MARKET INTEGRATION STATUS 
Based on Natural Gas Sector Law in transposition with the Third Energy Package the following milestones 
have occurred or are expected:
 March 2016: TAP AG certified as an independent transmission operator (TO) for natural gas.
 December 2016: New public company, ALBGAZ, was established with the functions and 
responsibilities of a combined transmission and distribution system operator of natural gas. 
 Nov 2017 – Certification of ALBGAZ by the ERE according to requirements of Law on Natural 
Gas Sector.
Tariff systems are still not developed and a number of other requirements of the Law on Natural Gas 
sector still remain to be implemented through secondary legislation, including:
 Approval by the Council of Ministers of a gas market model.
 Approval of Gas Market Rules by the ERE.  Third Party Access: the national company has not yet developed the Transmission Grid Code, 
which is subject of approval by the ERE.
 Balancing: the national company has not yet implemented the rules adopted in the new Law on 
Natural Gas sector.
 Eligibility: customers’ supplier selection programs are not developed yet.
 Price Regulation: similar to the new electricity law, where small customers are permitted to 
receive gas supplies from regulated (gas) supplier under public service obligation.
 Market Opening: small enterprises and household customers are permitted to choose their 
supplier.
 Protection of Vulnerable Customers: criteria defining this customers class still need to be defined 
and developed
3.13.11 BIOFUELS: MARKET INTEGRATION
Different forms of biomass resources are available in Albania to cover energy services related to heating; 
electricity generation; and transport, as shown in the Technical Annex. Figure 15 shows that fuel wood, 
agriculture crop waste, biomass pellets, and biogas contribute a very important share of the RES’s heating 
demand.

RES supplies in the transport sector, which are primarily biodiesel, are targeted at a 10% share of 
renewable energy in transport, and in the RES scenario, the transport biofuel share could reach up to 
15.5% at the year 2030, exceeding the target of 10%. 
3.13.12 REGIONAL BIOENERGY MARKET DEVELOPMENT 
Several important recommendations regarding how Albania might support development of a regional 
bioenergy market and how the regional market might supplement the Albanian biomass resources are 
summarized below20 and described in more detail in the Technical Annex. 
1. Identify the most urgent forest road rehabilitation projects in Albania through the preparation of
forest roads master plans in cooperation with other W-B countries. The plans should be prepared 
in line with best environmental practice for forest road rehabilitation guidelines. 
2. Legislation and regulatory technical framework should be improved in line with:
o Requirements set in international agreements of sustainable forest management and use;
o Principles of biodiversity conservation and mitigation of consequences of climate change.
3. Introduce techniques of silvicultural thinning of young forest stands, the conversion of coppices 
into high forests, and the increasing use of logging residues for production of woody biomass. 
4. Enhance the efficiency of data collection, control & monitoring mechanisms on sustainable forest 
management in Albania and W-B countries
5. Promote forest protection and sustainable forest management in order to decrease the 
consumption of woody biomass that is coming from unknown sources (58% of the total). Improve 
forest governance through simultaneous use of incentives, regulations, sanctions and rewards. 
 
20 Summarized from World Bank Study Report for establishing a regional market. “Sector Study on Biomass-based 
Heating in the Western Balkans,” Task 1 Report, May 2015.6. Reduce the risk of forest fires by establishing an integrated management system that involves: 
o Identification of main risks for forest fires and implementation of prevention activities 
through public awareness raising activities
o Improvement of equipment for the monitoring, surveillance and detection of the fires 
o Improvement of fire suppression equipment by providing vehicles for fighting forest fires.
7. Provide capacity building for all stakeholders at the local level, in order to gain their support for 
implementation of recommended activities. These activities would also support biomass market 
development in Albania.
8. Create the enabling environment for the use of agricultural residues for heating through the 
implementation of measures that involve:
o Utilization of the olive pomace from olive oil industry, wood processing, wine production 
and fruit processing industries for meeting the respective energy demand within the above
mentioned sectors and producing pellets/briquettes for selling them; 
o Use of abandoned agricultural land (mainly grasslands) that is currently not utilized for 
agricultural production;
o Increasing agricultural productivity, which is low compared to EU countries;
o Establishment of standards for the production of agricultural biomass feedstocks for energy 
purpose; and 
o Progress in developing commercially available conversion technologies that use agricultural 
biomass.
3.13.13 BIOFUEL SUPPORTING ALBANIAN RES TARGETS FOR TRANSPORT 
Albania has adopted in February 2008 and amended it on June 2016 a specific law (Law no. 9876, dated 
14.02.2008) on biofuels and other renewable fuels used for transport. The purpose of this new law is to 
promote production and use of biofuels and other renewable combustibles used for replacement of oil 
by-products in the transport sector, in order to help reduce GHG emissions, promote the cultivation of 
energy crops and to protect the environment. The law transposes the former EU Directive 2003/30/EC 
of May 8, 2003 on promotion of biofuels or other renewable fuels used for transport. The law on biofuels 
has established specific targets for using of biofuels in transportation sector, and according to the law on 
renewables these targets are integrated into the overall target for renewables in the total final energy 
consumption in the country. 
According to the law on renewables, implementation of the NREAP will be monitored by the agency 
responsible for the renewable energy sources, which is expecting to have authority and competencies in 
monitoring the compliance with the targets established for all renewables including biofuels. At the same 
time, the new law on biofuels will confer to the Agency responsible for renewables the responsibility for 
monitoring and verifying the compliance of biofuel producers with the sustainability criteria established in 
the law. The administration and protection of the land is made by the Sections of Land Administration and 
Protection established in each Council of County according to the Law no.8752, date 26.03.2001 “On 
establishing and functioning of structures for land administration and protection” as amended, and by the 
offices of land administration and protection in communes and/or municipalities. Albania has applied only one supporting measure for producers of biofuel, that of tax exemption. The 
scheme provides tax exemptions (VAT and custom duties) for machineries and equipment used for 
construction of a biofuel producing plant. Whoever gets a permit to construct a biofuel producing plant 
will benefit from this scheme. The scheme doesn’t have any specifications regarding the technology used 
for biofuel production to benefit from the scheme. The VAT is reimbursed according to the procedures 
provided for by the VAT law, while the exemption from custom duties is applied at the moment that the 
machinery and equipment enter the border of Albania. As mentioned above, despite the fact that the law 
requires that the Council of Minister, upon the joint proposal of the Ministers responsible for energy and 
transport, approves the minimum percentage of biofuels to be used in transport sector in a year, no such 
annual obligations have been established. 
On the other hand, the amendment to the law on biofuels approved in October 2014, removed all biofuels 
and other RES fuels used in transportation sector from the excise tax till 2018 with the objective to make 
these fuels competitive in the market. However, transposing the section of biofuels in the EU RES 
Directive 2009/28 into a new law on biofuels in Albania remains one of the future actions in this sector. 
3.13.14 EU BIOFUEL MARKET - PRODUCTION, SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
Biodiesel is also the most important biofuel in the EU and, the EU is the world’s largest biodiesel producer. 
Biodiesel has been used in the EU transport sector since the 1990s, during which time, rapid expansion 
was driven by increasing crude oil prices, provisions for the production of oilseeds under Common 
Agricultural Policy set-aside programs, and generous tax incentives, mainly in Germany and France. The 
structure of the EU biodiesel sector is very diverse and plant sizes range from an annual capacity of 250,000 
tons owned by a group of farmers to 1,000,000 tons owned by a large multi-national company. EU biodiesel 
production capacity is expected to increase to 25.5 billion liters (22.3 million tons) in 2017, when a new 
biodiesel facility in France is expected to start production. Biodiesel production facilities exist in every EU 
member state with the exception of Luxemburg. 
Demand for biofuels in Albania is based on the NREAP biofuel target, which is approximately 95.53 ktoe 
for the year 2020 (108,000 tons per year). There is currently one biodiesel plant in Albania located in 
Porto Romano, which is near Durres, and has a production capacity of 100.000 tons per year of biodiesel 
and 20,000 tons per year in glycerin. The Plant is connected through a pipeline with the Porto Romano 
Port infrastructure, and it is connected by land through the main highway of the country. This biodiesel 
refinery has the capacity to supply biofuels to the market in Albania, and this plant could cover the supplies 
needed to meet the RES transport targets until 2025. In addition, the plant will have an initial surplus 
production that could be traded to neighboring countries like Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia, which 
for time being do not have such refineries. Albania has no possibility to export to EU countries since the 
unit cost of biodiesel production in Albania is high compared to EU producer since the plant capacity in 
Porto Romano is 2.5 to 10 times lower than average EU’s plant capacities. 4. FINANCIAL RESOURCES
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
The National Strategy of Energy is a multidimensional strategy with a long-term planning horizon (2014-
2030) that involves a considerable number of sectors and sub-sectors, policies and results. This chapter 
aims to identify the financial resources that are likely to be required for implementation of the policies, 
objectives and results that have been identified in this Strategy. Given the uncertainties inherent is 
developing an energy strategy, the investment funding needs for each scenario were developed in general 
terms from the LEAP model scenario results and specific sectoral cost parameters. This chapter describes 
how these financial requirements were estimated, and presents a detailed breakdown by sector.
The total investment needs can be sourced directly from private investors (foreign and domestic), donor 
institutions, and public institutions, including public funding from the state budget. The investment 
contributions can take the form of grants, loans and other anticipated capital, operational and major 
technical assistance funding. The estimates that follow include all the sources that fulfil the investment
funding needs.
It is expected that the National Energy Strategy will have a minimal influence on the distribution of public 
expenditures, and that the required investments are mostly likely to come from private sources, 
development banks, foreign technical assistance and finally from the state budget. To that end, it is intended 
that proposed financial instruments do not have, or have minimal influence on the competitive market 
conditions in the context of free market access and development of sustainable market prices, with no 
cross-subsidization and compliance with EU rules on state aid if such is applied. 
Due to the fact that this National Strategy of Energy extends over the period of 2018 to 2030, it is likely 
that unforeseen developments may occur during the years to come, not only to identified objectives,
which may be achieved earlier than planned, but also to new challenges which may arise in the future. 
Therefore, existing planned resources may need to shift from one budget program to the other, or new 
resources may need to be committed according to new needs.
This chapter quantifies the likely capital investment expenditures over time and will serve as a reference 
document guiding future government spending plans. In the meantime, the existing staff of the responsible
institutions in most cases will be directly responsible for the implementation of the necessary operational 
measures. 
4.2 METHODOLOGY 
This financial chapter covers the required investments for all sectors of the Albanian energy system: power 
sector (generation, transmission and distribution), natural gas supply (transmission and distribution), crude 
oil (exploration, production, refining and distribution), energy efficiency investment for all sectors and 
investment for all renewable energy sources.
4.2.1 POWER SECTOR
In order to meet the growing demand for electricity and reduce the level of import, different scenarios 
have been prepared through the Albania-LEAP model and it has served to identify a new power plant
expansion plan for each scenario based on a minimal cost of generation approach. The generation investment cost is determined from the investment costs for each power plant in the expansion plan and
are based on current Albanian data according to many feasibility study for SHPPs, medium and large HPPs, 
WPPs, PvPP, Natural Gas CCs and GTs, using average figures for the specific investments for the 
respective technologies.
The investment cost for expansion of the high voltage transmission system, including 400 kV, 220 kV and 
110 kV networks, is based on the cost information contained in the Electricity Demand Forecast by OST, 
which were used to determine average the system expansion cost as a function of the overall increase in 
electricity consumption, which is specific to each scenario. 
Investment costs for the distribution system include: a) upgrading the sub-transmission distribution system 
to improve reliability; b) targeted investments in the medium voltage grid (6-20 kV); c) customer metering 
d) system metering for the low voltage network; and e) upgrading of the company’s management 
information and billing and collection system. The basic investment data was taken from an ongoing project 
of OSHEE and WB/IBRD regarding improvements to the distribution and transmission system. 
Table 14 provides the cumulative power sector investments for 2018 to 2030, expressed in million Euros 
(MEUR), for generation, transmission, and distribution for the Baseline, EE, RES, and Combined scenarios. 
For the Natural Gas Promotion scenario, the power sector investment requirements follow the Baseline 
scenario, and are not shown in the table. Table 22 provides the annual investment profile for each 
scenario. 
Table 14 indicates that the Baseline scenario has the highest required power sector investment for the 
period 2018-2030, while the Energy Efficiency scenario has the lowest required power sector investment, 
showing the potential cumulative investment savings equal to 951 MEURO. 
4.2.2 NATURAL GAS SECTOR
Investment costs for natural gas infrastructure are based on data in the Masterplan of Natural Gas for 
supplying gas to different sectors according to the following assumptions:
 Interconnection costs include the incremental costs needed to prepare TAP for offtake within
Albanian territory; 
 Transmission and distribution system investment costs include the following:
 Connection of Vlora TPP;

million Euros (MEUR), for interconnection, transmission and distribution in the Natural Gas Promotion 
scenario. Table 23 provides the annual investment profile for each component.
4.2.3 OIL SECTOR
This Energy Strategy supports the exploration and production of the crude oil from the existing oil fields
and new ones. The Strategy takes into account the current domestic import, and identifies the internal 
infrastructure of crude oil and oil by products transport, product stocking, and modern standards 
management needed to reach a minimal cost of service for oil and oil byproducts and avoid temporary 
market abnormalities. The investments required for exploration and oil production are based on 
information from AKBN for existing and new oil fields. 
The Strategy supports the rehabilitation of Ballsh and Fier refineries to European norms and standards, 
including adoption of environmental norms (below 1% sulphur) for refinery products and technology, 
increasing refinery processing capacity to 1.5 Mt/year, modernization of Vlora terminal, and modernization
of transport infrastructure from Vlora to Ballsh.
Investment costs for rehabilitation and modernization of the two refineries depends directly on the actual 
situation of installations, equipment and environment pollution level. Ministry of Energy and Industry also 
is considering the option of building new refineries with 3.2 Million tons capacities. Estimates for the 
investment cost required for rehabilitation of the existing refineries and constructing new refineries are 
based on information from AKBN.
Fuel oil by product market infrastructure in Albania includes a large number of distributors, and the total 
number of retail stations should be reduced and better optimized according to European norms and 
standards. The investment required for improvements to the downstream infrastructure for oil byproducts are also based on information from AKBN. Table 16 provides the cumulative oil sector 
investment costs for 2018 to 2030, expressed in million Euros (MEUR), for exploration and production, 
rehabilitation, infrastructure improvements and construction of new refineries, and Table 24 provides the 
annual investment profile for each component.

Total 347.04.2.4 EE SUPPORT 
Measures undertaken during the 1st NEEAP were predominantly done with either the direct support of 
an international financing institution (IFI) or donor, or were provided via local commercial bank loans 
supported by an IFI or donor. This support came both via financial and technical means according to the 
analysis carried out and presented under the 2nd and 3rd NEEAP. Such international support may continue,
but to scale-up energy efficiency actions requires that increased domestic funds (public and private) are 
made available. In order to realize many of the efficiency measures, the EE law calls for development of an 
Energy Efficiency Fund, as a mechanism of financial support for the implementation of EE projects in the 
public and private sectors. Financing of the Energy Efficiency Fund is foreseen to come from the Albanian 
state budget (limited to public awareness campaigns and pilot projects pursued in the public sector), 
external donors, the fund’s activities and offered services. The Energy Efficiency Fund aims to provide 
financial support and project management for developing a market of energy efficiency improvement and 
supporting programs for final customers with high-cost and high-risk investments. The Fund will be used 
to promote energy efficiency improvement programs, energy service companies, independent energy 
experts, energy auditors, energy distributors, distribution system operators, retail energy sales companies 
and installers of efficient equipment.
A competitive bidding process should be used for fund allocation and for selection of third parties to carry 
out awareness campaign and pilot projects based on the legislation and procedures defined under the EE 
Fund Procedures, which also should be in line with Public Procurement Law.
The Energy Efficiency Fund will in itself have limited financial means for achieving all the objectives noted 
within the second NEEAP. The funding proposed from the State Budget should be seen as a tool to 
leverage greater resources from external parties (IFI and donors as well as private banks). To do this the 
EE Fund, in addition to direct financing, has the option of providing loan guarantees, subordinate debt, 
investment gap financing or interest-rate buy-downs. 
To reach the EE Target of a 6.8% energy savings for the year 2020, a ballpark estimate of approximately 
100 MEUR added investment was calculated assuming an average investment cost per energy saved of
0.05 Euro/kWh. The biggest part of such investment will be direct financing, with the option of providing 
loan guarantees, subordinated debt, investment gap financing or interest-rate buy-downs, and the main 
task of the state budget is to carry out awareness campaign and pilot projects to promote EE in all 
economic sectors.

4.2.5 RES SUPPORT
The financial support to RES power producers is provided through two schemes: i) Contract for 
differences (feed-in tariffs) for Priority RES producers with installed capacity up to 15 MW and ii) Tax 
exemption.
With the approval of the new law on renewable, and the new Market Model, only the small RES Producers 
with installed capacity up to 2 MW (PV) and 3 MW (Wind) will continue to benefit from the feed-in tariffs, 
while other Priority RES Producers with installed capacity from 2 to 15MW will be subject of feed-in 
premium provided through the CfD applied for them in the day ahead market. 
Therefore, this RES support is covered by final customers through a dedicated surcharge in their final 
rates, and the primary state budget funding to be allocated for RES support will go towards awareness 
campaigns and pilot projects, which indirectly will assist to achieve the national RES target.

by the natural gas sector (347.0 MEURO). 
4.3.1 STATE BUDGET AND PUBLIC INVESTMENT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR EACH SECTOR
Estimates of the state budget and public investment contribution for each energy sector required to reach 
the identified strategic objectives have been calculated based on the following assumptions:
 Total investment for generation (including RES Plants and Natural Gas CCGTs) will be based on 
the private initiatives. KESH should support not only rehabilitation projects of the existing 
generation assets, but the construction of new capacities as well. KESH shall support not only 
rehabilitation projects of the existing generation assets, but the construction of new capacities 
as well. KESH will continue to support only rehabilitation of Drin River Cascade based on the 
ongoing project. ; Based on the WB study, KESH sh.a has prepared a project proposal for the 
Development of HEC Skavica (Feasibility Study, business model and socio-economic assessment) 
which, after being included in the National Strategic Package in 2016-2017 by the National

technical assistance grant at EUR 1.5 million (Project Code: WB17-ALB-ENE-03). Also, 
additional investment identified for the conversion of Vlora TPP into gas fired technology.
 Transmission, Distribution of Electricity, Exploration and Production of Crude Oil, 
Rehabilitation of Ballsh & Fier Refineries will be based on the general assumption considering 
that each investment will have a structure of the capital as follows: equity contribution from 
OST and OSHEE will be 20-30% of total specific required investment and the rest will covered 
from the IFIs and possibly from private banks; 
 Natural Gas interconnection, transmission and distribution investment will be based on private 
initiatives, with an equity contribution will be 20-30% of total specific required investment.

contributions are not likely to put pressure on the state budget, and it is very important that the Albanian
Government undertake these contributions on order to facilitate attraction of the needed private sector 
and donor investments. 
4.3.2 PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND DONOR RESOURCES REQUIRED FOR EACH SUBSECTOR
The remaining investment requirements are assumed to be met by private investors (foreign and domestic)
and donors financing, which could include development bank loans, technical assistance support and grants.

5.1 INTRODUCTION 
Implementation of the National Energy Strategy is a very significant undertaking for Albania, requiring 
consistent and meaningfully applied political will, coordination of all energy related stakeholders within the 
country, and cooperation with Albania’s development partners. Furthermore, successful implementation 
depends on the commitment of private investors, donors, public energy companies and state budget 
resources, and the cost-effective management of these resources within state institutions to achieve the 
expected results, outcomes, and impacts. Successful implementation of the National Energy Strategy 
depends on sound governance, clearly defined accountabilities, transparency, and the ongoing participation 
of a wide range of institutions within the government and externally. 
Reporting, monitoring and evaluation analysis are essential for an efficient and timely implementation of 
the National Energy Strategy, and this chapter identifies a set of clearly defined metrics for monitoring of 
the Energy Strategy’s main objectives. These monitoring metrics build upon the strategic objectives 
discussed in section 2.2 and the strategic metrics discussed in section 2.3 to provide a clear basis for 
monitoring Albania’s progress towards implementing this Energy Strategy. 
5.2 MONITORING INDICATORS 
The monitoring metrics will be measured through specific indicators, which were selected from the 
respective indicators used for the National Strategy for Development and Integration 2015-2020, RES 
Targets, EE Targets and NDC Targets already committed to by the Albanian Government until 2020. 
Implementation of the Strategy will be monitored through and benchmarked against a set of thirteen 
monitoring indicators, which are generally available on an annual basis. These monitoring indicators are 
listed below:
 Reduction of transmission technical electricity losses;
 Reduction of distribution non-technical electricity losses;
 Reduction of distribution technical electricity losses;
 Increasing rate of electricity collection;
 Level of cross-subsidies in energy supply
 Rate of switching the supplier
 Opening of electricity market (percentage of energy supplied from the competitive market - both 
domestic and from imports); 
 Self-sufficiency of domestic primary energy produced versus total primary energy supply
 Imports of energy ;
 National Energy Efficiency Target;
 Utilization of renewable energy in TPES (RES Target);
 Biofuel Targets as share of biofuels versus total fuel consumption in transport sector;
 CO2 emission reductions; and Natural Gas Penetration.
Ministry of Energy and Industry together with ERE, AKBN, EE Agency are responsible for monitoring and 
providing an efficient implementation of the energy strategy for all respective sectors. The annual 
monitoring report should focus on results, indicators, current and perspective tendencies, barriers 
encountered during the reporting period, lessons learned and achievements, measures to be undertaken 
for speeding up development in certain energy sectors and on the results reached during the reporting 
period. While the responsibility for the overall implementation oversight rests with Ministry of Energy 
and Industry, strategy implementation involves almost all line ministries, central government institutions 
and local government.
5.3 MONITORING TARGETS
The monitoring indicators will be evaluated periodically by Ministry of Energy and Industry together with 
ERE, AKBN, EE Agency. Annual monitoring reports on the implementation of the National Energy 
Strategy will be presented for review to the Council of Ministers for approval. 
Information will be collected for the respective monitoring indicators in accordance with the type of 
intervention. Monitoring data should be collected annually, and some of this data will be inserted into the 
Yearly Energy Balance, which is prepared and updated by the Ministry of Energy and Industry through 
AKBN. A functional task of AKBN will be making requests for data that are to be generated by all public 
and private energy companies, and carrying out surveys for determining the level of consumption among 
various energy demand sectors. The data collected will be confirmed and transferred in EUROSTAT 
Energy Balance Template, where data will be processed and systemized in tables with the monitoring 
indicators. All monitoring indicators will be part of the annual monitoring report, which will be submitted 
for decision-making to the Ministry of Energy and Industry, and then sent officially to the Council of 
Ministers. 
Table 30 presents an initial set of monitoring indicators, which includes their baseline values (for the year 
2015), short-term goals (2020), medium term goals (2025) and long term goals (2030).
The annual reports shall address progress in all of energy sectors and subsectors, either in terms of 
significant achievement or in terms of significant issues, such as major policy shifts, serious implementation 
issues, or other factors. The reports will be produced in a timely manner, so that government institutions 
and development partners might take the appropriate action. The production of the annual reports may 
be combined with an annual government–development partner conference or roundtable.Table 30: Main Energy Indicators and Targets for the National Energy Strategy
