About RRA
A Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a holistic evaluation of a country’s conditions and 
identifies the actions needed to overcome barriers to renewable energy deployment. This is a 
country-led process, with IRENA primarily providing technical support and expertise to facilitate 
consultations among different national stakeholders. While the RRA helps to shape appropriate 
policy and regulatory choices, each country determines which renewable energy sources and 
technologies are relevant and consistent with national priorities. The RRA is a dynamic process 
that can be adapted to each country’s circumstances and needs. Experience in a growing 
range of countries and regions, meanwhile, has allowed IRENA to continue refining the basic RRA 
methodology. In June 2013, IRENA published a guide for countries seeking to conduct the process 
in order to accelerate their renewable energy deployment.

RENEWABLES READINESS 
ASSESSMENT 2013FOREWORD
The Gambia, at present, is totally dependent on petroleum products for 
transport and electricity generation. This dependency has continued in 
spite of the existence of a formulated renewable energy policy, maintaining pressure on the national economy and ensuring a weak balance 
of payments. Given the volatility of international fuel prices, The Gambia 
has one of the highest electricity tariffs in the West African sub-region.
The Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) for the Gambia could 
not, therefore, have come at a better time. 
The availability of adequate, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy 
is a critical milestone in the socio-economic development of any country. 
While less than half of all households in The Gambia have access to electricity, over 90% are still dependent on solid biomass for cooking and 
heating. This has intensified poverty. Thus, a top priority in government 
energy policy to promote the deployment and use of renewable energy 
and energy-efficiency (RE/EE) technologies, in order to improve energy 
security and access to modern energy services. To fulfil this objective, 
the government has taken a number of steps: establishing The Gambia 
Renewable Energy Centre (GREC); adopting a policy of zero import duty 
on RE/EE technologies; and recently drafted a renewable energy law. 
These efforts have been constrained by inadequate financial, human and 
institutional resources, which remain major challenges, as highlighted by 
the RRA. Concerted efforts by all stakeholders are therefore needed to 
bring down these barriers.In recognising the strong support of our traditional donors in the 
energy sector, it is our expectation that the International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA) will share this RRA report with a wider spectrum of partners. Our hope is to attract more support, to reduce the 
constraints identified, and bring more investment, so as to facilitate rapid 
renewable energy deployment and broaden access to energy 
services, thereby improving economic growth and reducing poverty in 
The Gambia. We also have great hopes that the experiences gained 
in The Gambia will also provide helpful lessons for applying the RRA
methodology in other countries. My own, admittedly personal, assessment is that the methodology has proven highly effective in defining the 
barriers to rapid renewable energy technology development. 
Hon. Teneng Mba Jaiteh, 
Minister of Energy, 
The GambiaFOREWORD
The Africa High-Level Consultative Forum held by the International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in July 2011 highlighted the need 
for technical support for African countries and regions to identify their 
renewable energy readiness. The Renewables Readiness Assessment 
(RRA) process stemming from this involves a holistic evaluation of a 
country’s conditions and identifies the actions needed to overcome 
barriers to renewable energy deployment. This is a country-led process, 
with IRENA primarily providing technical support and expertise to 
facilitate consultations among different national stakeholders.
Since 2011, more than 14 countries in Africa, the Middle East, Latin 
America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific Islands have undertaken 
the RRA process, which generates knowledge of good practices 
and supports international cooperation to enable the accelerated 
deployment of renewable technologies. The Gambia, in keeping with 
its strong and consistent support of IRENA’s mission, is one of these 
pioneering countries. 
As the RRA highlights, The Gambia has relatively high electricity tariffs. 
However, with an electricity network consisting of mini-grids, the country 
is well positioned to integrate solutions based on renewable energy. 
IRENA and several partners – with their understanding enhanced by the 
RRA process – have initiated studies to demonstrate the commercial 
viability of hybrid mini-grids in The Gambia and thereby attract 
investment.IRENA would like to thank Minister Jaiteh and her team for their patience 
and generosity in hosting this study. Their engagement and input 
have exceeded expectations, and we are grateful for their important 
contributions, which have resulted in valuable insights for further RRAs 
in the 2014-2015 period. Additionally, this report will feed into other 
IRENA regional work, including modelling and analysis on planning and 
prospects for renewable energy in West Africa.
We sincerely hope that the outcomes of these RRA consultations 
will help The Gambia’s to fulfil its aim to scale up renewable energy. 
IRENA stands ready to provide continuing support to The Gambia in 
implementing the actions identified.

The Gambia, located in West Africa, has an estimated population of 
1.8 million as of 2012, with an annual growth rate of 2.7% per annum and 
the share of the urban population increasing from 37% in 1993 to about 
55% today. With about 48.4% of the population currently living below 
the USD 1.25/day mark, The Gambia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
grew steadily at an average of 6.3% in 2003-2010, but declined sharply 
(to -4.4%) in 2011. Biomass, including fuel wood, accounts for about 60% 
of the country’s energy supply and more than 90% of household energy 
consumption, while petroleum products (liquefied petroleum gas for 
cooking; diesel and heavy fuel oil for generating electricity) account for 
36%, and electricity for about 4% of energy supply. Over 65% of the 
population lacks access to electricity.
The Gambia has great potential to accelerate renewable energy use to 
power its growing economy. The government recognises that developing local and renewable resources is critical to meeting its economic 
and social objectives. It is promoting this development by creating the 
necessary policy space and developing appropriate regulatory and legal 
frameworks.
The Gambia needs to overcome its dual challenges of energy access and 
security of supply, which cut across all sectors and have an impact on all 
Gambians. Current biomass use is contributing heavily to land degradation and deforestation, and the pressure will continue to increase due to 
a growing population. 
Electricity is a key challenge in terms of both quality and access. The 
existing power infrastructure in The Gambia is dilapidated and urgently 
needs modernising and refurbishing. Voltage fluctuation, spikes, blackouts, brownouts and other disruptions create concern for industrial, 
commercial and residential customers. The continued dependence on 
imported fuel for generating electricity is also taking its toll on the wider 
economy. In short, the energy system has become a burden on the 
Gambian economy and society – part of the problem of development 
rather than the solution. The status quo is unsustainable. 
The Gambian government considers the provision of electricity to all 
as critical to inclusive economic transformation. It recognises off-grid 
renewable energy as a practical, potentially cost-effective alternative to expanding the grid to every corner of the 
country. The government electrification 
strategy has embraced both grid-based 
and off-grid options. 
Renewable energy systems are well positioned to play a critical role in addressing this growing energy demand for the 
following reasons: 
•	 The Gambia has abundant renewable
energy resources that could help meet 
growing demand. The Gambia has 
abundant solar energy resources across 
the country, a good biomass resource in 
most areas, and a modest wind regime 
along the coast. These resources can 
be developed to bring higher-quality 
energy services to populations across 
the country.
•	 Renewable energy safeguards energy
access. The Gambia’s use of locally 
available renewable resources will 
reduce its dependence on imported and 
expensive fossil fuels, which it can ill 
afford. There is already strong pent-up 
demand for energy, especially electricity. As national demand for electricity 
increases, it will be necessary to look 
into options that are affordable, reliable 
and have predictable cost attributes. 
•	 Renewable energy costs have fallen
significantly and are likely to continue 
declining. The increased dash for fossil 
resources is likely to push prices up, 
while increased renewable technology deployment pushes prices down, 
in line with progress in technology 
and economies of scale. This offers an 
opportunity for The Gambia to rethink 
its energy strategy. 
•	 Off-grid renewable power can meet
demand in unserved rural areas in The 
Gambia and can replace existing dieseldriven systems. The Gambia has yet 
to build its energy infrastructure in a 
planned and systematic manner. At the 
moment, much of its rural electrification programme relies on international 
donors. The national utility is struggling to maintain service to existing 
customers. As a distributed and scalable option, many renewable energy 
technologies are well suited to meet 
the need for power in remote areas. 
•	 The Gambia needs to increase the
available capacity supplied to the grid. 
Power produced through renewable 
systems can be fed into the grid in The 
Gambia, providing a clean and reliable 
power supply. The country already has 
some experience in this area. At present, the government is working on a 
Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) scheme, grid code 
modification and a standard Power 
Purchase Agreement (PPA) that would 
facilitate private-sector entry into The 
Gambia’s power sector.
•	 The West African Power Pool (WAPP)
represents an important opportunity 
for The Gambia. A large bulk of the 
power likely to be generated through 
the WAPP will be hydropower, a renewable energy resource. Given the scale 
of power produced through the power 
pool and Gambian power production and transmission challenges, The 
Gambia is expected to greatly benefit 
in terms of cheaper electricity supply. 
The Gambia also needs to build up its technical and regulatory capacity. The level of 
skills in The Gambia is not sufficient for 
the magnitude of the energy challenge 
in the country. The government will need 
to revitalise its technical arm, the Gambia 
Renewable Energy Centre (GREC), to provide scaled-up technology development, finance, regulation and management 
support. Further capacity will need to be 
built in research institutions and among 
community stakeholders.
Renewable energy development represents 
an area of tremendous opportunity for 
The Gambia. This Renewables Readiness 
Assessment report lays out the energy 
challenges that The Gambia faces today, 
along with ways the country has supported 
the development of renewable energy 
programmes. It shows the impact these 
programmes have had on the energy landscape, as well as the enormous constraints 
that still remain. The report provides information about the role of renewable energy 
in The Gambia so far and the policies that 
have been implemented to support renewable energy deployment. It also outlines 
the potential for renewable energy technologies to be integrated into the Gambian 
energy mix in a way that services the country’s development priorities and goals. 
Recommended actions 
A draft renewable energy bill was validated 
in December 2012, pending presentation 
before the National Assembly for adoption. 
A number of national stakeholders will play 
a part in rolling out the act. The Ministry of 
Energy is to recommend national targets 
for the use of renewable energy resources, 
the Ministry of Finance and Economic 
Affairs is to provide tax exemptions to 
renewable-energy equipment and 
renewable-based electricity, while the 
Public Utility Regulatory Authority is to 
implement a regulatory framework that 
includes defining the rules for pricing 
renewable electricity through FITs, as well 
as setting up and managing a renewable 
energy fund. This provides the legal foundation for efficient promotion of renewable 
energy resources and is considered a major 
milestone in delivering some of the key 
priorities in the Programme for Accelerated 
Growth and Employment (PAGE) 
2012-2015; its enactment, therefore, would 
be worth speeding up. 
The Gambia currently has no renewable energy technology standards. Most 
operators in the renewable energy sector, 
despite having a solid track record in delivering power-generation projects, are not 
complying with any specific standards. The 
renewables market is expected to expand 
and new entrants appear in the trading and 
system-installation market. The draft FIT 
scheme and PPA mention general codes 
and standards that should apply to renewable energy plants. However, it would also 
be worth creating specific standards and 
codes for renewable energy technologies, 
in order to ensure adequate quality, design, 
safety, and operation and maintenance of 
equipment (whether imported or locally 
manufactured). 
Thus, the role of GREC will need to be redefined and its capacity developed further. 
As a knowledge hub within the Ministry 
of Energy, GREC could play a pivotal role 
in maintaining high standards of research 
and development activities. It could use 
its own human resources and work with 
non-governmental organisations (NGOs), 
the private sector and tertiary educational institutions. However, funding for the 
continuous support of research and development in the renewable energy sector 
has been discontinued. Adequate staffing 
was not maintained. The Gambia should 
therefore support the revival of GREC by 
entrusting the centre with a number of 
roles. These include scientific, technological and innovation research in renewable 
energy, promoting renewables for industrial 
uses, and building the capacity of installers of renewable energy systems with proper 
certification. In order to attract qualified 
expertise for this purpose, the government of The Gambia will need to allocate 
a specific budget from internal sources. 
It will also need to support partnerships 
between GREC and well-established international centres of excellence in the renewable energy sector with similar mandate.
The Gambia has conducted solar and wind 
resource measurements at eight stations 
across the country. The study confirmed 
the existence of a good resource base, 
including considerable solar energy, some 
wind-power potential along the coast, and 
biomass, which could be used for improving 
the electrification rate and diversifying the 
electricity mix, as envisaged in the PAGE. 
Usually, sites are screened on the basis of a 
solar/ wind atlas, validated with measurements from meteorological stations, and 
monitored for about a year before wind 
turbines are installed. This procedure was 
not followed at the Gambian sites, given 
the country’s poor meteorological intelligence. The government must create the 
conditions for attracting investments to 
strengthen the observation network, as 
well as make the necessary preparations to 
obtain a good understanding of the wind 
regime across the country. This will help 
in making informed decisions, including 
setting achievable targets, and will, furthermore, help The Gambia take advantage of 
the significant interest of private operators seeking involvement in the renewable 
energy sector. 
The rural energy system, as it has evolved 
to date, is complex and not disposed to 
adequate planning and resource coordination. The upfront cost of renewable 
energy systems is a disadvantage in rural 
communities, with little income or funds to 
obtain electricity services. Soft loans can 
be attractive, with a small down payment 
being made on the total price, and the 
rest being paid over a number of years 
at a preferential interest rate. The draft 
renewable energy law, currently under 
discussion, supports the establishment 
of a renewable energy fund, which would 
be administered by the Public Utility 
Regulatory Authority and would provide 
financial incentives such as capital subsidies, production-based subsidies and 
equity participation. These would be available for mini-grid and off-grid renewable 
power systems for remote areas and islands 
and should attract private investment in the 
sector. The expected challenge would be to 
ensure that the renewable energy fund has 
sufficient resources to maintain the investment momentum. The government will 
need to employ a variety of creative fundraising mechanisms to sustain the fund.
The Gambia has built credible human 
capacity in some renewable applications, 
such as solar photovoltaic (PV) and waterheating systems. However, as yet, there 
are no government or NGO-led public 
education programmes and no formalised 
technical training programmes. Capacity 
development for planning and implementing large-scale off-grid (and also on-grid) 
programmes will need to be increased if the 
promise of renewable energy resources is 
to be fully realised. Private-sector involvement will require multiple skills in energy 
analysis, engineering, finance and management in order to build a strong renewable 
energy business environment.I. INTRODUCTION
Country background
The Gambia, with an area of 11570 km2, is located in West Africa. 
It extends about 400 km inland along the banks of the Gambia River 
and is bordered by Senegal on three sides. The Gambia has an estimated population of 1.8m as of 2012, with an annual growth rate of 
2.7% per annum and a population density of 120 people/km2. The country is currently undergoing a rapid rate of urbanisation with the share 
of urban population increasing from 37% in 1993 to about 55% today 
(World Bank, 2013) 
The Gambia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew steadily at an 
average of 6.3% in 2003-2010, but declined sharply (to -4.4%) in 2011 
due to sluggish tourism and unfavourable weather conditions. These led 
to a 60% drop in crop production (IMF, 2013). With a partial rebound 
in agriculture and strong performance in tourism, the economy showed 
signs of recovery in 2012. It continues to make further gains, with 
real GDP growth expected to reach 4.3% and 5.1% in 2013 and 2014 
respectively (AEO, 2012). 
The agriculture sector contributes approximately 25% of the GDP but 
employs nearly 75% of the population, provides 50% of the national food 
requirement and accounts for 70% of domestic exports. It is thus subject 
to wide fluctuations conditioned by external market situations (Africa 
Energy Outlook (AEO), 2012). The government has therefore prioritised 
the development of the agricultural sector by putting in place measures 
that will transform it into a market-oriented, modern and efficient sector. 
The service sector accounts for approximately 60% of GDP, within 
which tourism, re-export, trade and telecommunication have been the 
major drivers of growth and job creation. Telecommunications are well 
developed with a mobile penetration rate of 89% (well above the 53% 
African average).Manufacturing, mining and quarrying remain the smallest component of 
the economy, accounting for 4.9% and 
2.7% respectively of GDP in 2011. Despite 
government efforts to promote manufacturing, it has been stagnant for years. This 
can be explained partly by the small size 
of the market but also high energy costs, 
low investment and weak trade facilitation. Mining and quarrying exploration is 
in progress, as The Gambia is thought to 
be endowed with mineral products such as 
clay, silica sand, titanium, tin and zircon. 
According to the World Bank (2013), net 
flow of foreign direct investment was 
around USD 36m in 2011, and reached a 
high point of USD 82m in 2006. The distribution of financial flows was mainly from 
real estate, construction and tourism. The 
net official development assistance and 
official aid received by The Gambia in 2011 
amounted to USD 76m. 
Poverty in The Gambia remains pervasive. 
It was placed 169th out of 189 countries in 
the 2012 Human Development Index (HDI) 
rankings. With about 48.4% of the population currently living under the USD 1.25/
day (Gambian government, 2011), poverty 
alleviation is a national priority. Poverty 
incidence is the highest among households 
whose main income is derived from agriculture and fisheries. The government has 
developed a medium-term framework in 
the Programme for Accelerated Growth 
and Employment (PAGE) for 2012-2015 
with the aim to accelerate pro-poor growth 
and generate efficient employment. 
The government designed PAGE to focus 
on strategic areas of intervention linked 
to the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs). Acknowledging the importance 
of energy as a crucial input to economic 
development, PAGE has made energy 
access a strategic focus. It recognised that 
by providing affordable and reliable energy 
services to support small businesses and 
social services, the socio-economic conditions of the population can be improved 
and the MDGs achieved. The government 
plans to focus on modernising the electricity supply infrastructure, improving the 
existing regulatory framework and increasing the RE contribution in the energy mix. 
Role of energy in 
development in The Gambia
As highlighted in PAGE 2012-15 and earlier 
development programmes, The Gambia 
needs to scale up its energy services, 
both in quality and quantity, to meet the 
country’s social and economic development needs. Present per capita electricity 
consumption is 136 kilowatt-hours (kWh) 
per year against an African average of 
over 575 kWh and a global average of over 
2770 kWh. This makes the average Gambian 
citizen among the lowest consumers of 
electricity in the world. What is more, over 
65% of the population lacks access to electricity, and the level of suppressed demand 
in the national power sector is significant. 
This suggests that The Gambia needs to 
close the gap between electricity demand 
and what it is able to supply to its citizens. 
More than 90% of Gambian households 
rely heavily on traditional biomass to meet 
their basic energy needs. This comes at a 
significant price. It means poor fuel quality, 
with the associated health impacts as well 
as an unnecessary amount of time spent 
in collection, though this is comparatively 
modest compared to other countries. The 
Gambia has ample biomass resources and 
a good potential to engage in sustainable 
harvesting for household fuel and possibly for generating electricity. It also has 
significant solar energy and modest wind 
resources along its coastal areas that can 
be successfully harnessed for power supply and water heating. There is some experience in The Gambia of converting these 
resources into useful energy. This limited 
experience shows the untapped potential 
Renewable Energy (RE) technologies are 
well suited for both urban and rural energy 
applications. Indeed, the time is ripe for The 
Gambia to take advantage of critical global 
developments in clean energy sources, 
which are rapidly becoming cost-effective 
options. Furthermore, The Gambia’s high 
oil import bills and financial losses experienced by its struggling energy utility 
imposes a burden on the national economy 
and is a handicap to growth. Developing 
its RE programme, opening the market to 
IPPs and upgrading grid infrastructure to 
reduce distribution losses (both commercial and technical) should therefore be a 
central development strategy. 
The Gambia’s future development will 
largely be determined by whether it takes 
full advantage of these opportunities. It 
has done well in solving a number of development problems in education, health and 
water services, and energy services have 
played a major role in this respect. To 
this end, there needs to be a major new 
programme to improve access to clean 
energy services for rural communities and 
enhance security of supply to its industries and other key economic sectors. This 
is part of The Gambia’s aim to safeguard 
the welfare of its people and to its drive 
towards economic transformation. 
Lack of access need not be a permanent 
problem for countries such as The Gambia. 
Indeed, many of the emerging economies 
that have now achieved universal access 
were once struggling with the same energy-related difficulties. In many of these 
successful cases, energy interventions 
in the social and economic sectors were 
implemented as part of a comprehensive 
development strategy. These two goals 
are not mutually exclusive but intertwined. 
For The Gambia, making a transition out of 
inefficient biomass use and imported fuel 
dependency will not be easy. However, it 
has an opportunity to deploy renewables 
and use energy efficiently as part of its 
effort to build a resilient energy system. 
This will require sound policies, an effective 
regulatory framework, robust and dynamic

ASSESSMENT (RRA) process 
in The Gambia
A senior officer at the Ministry of Energy 
(MOE) with a thorough knowledge and 
experience in renewables was the RRA
representative for The Gambia. 
Following preparations by the national 
consultant and MOE, a representative from 
the ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy 
and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) wrote 
to the key institutions selected to be part 
of the technical/expert team. They were 
invited to the formal launch of the RRA at a 
kick-off meeting on 24 July 2012. The institutions who took part in the process are 
listed in section 3 of this report. The technical/expert team was divided into three 
thematic subgroups.
The subgroups met on 21, 22 and 23 August 
2012 respectively, having had time to go 
through zero draft templates prepared 
by the national consultant in advance of 
their scheduled meetings. The subgroups 
reviewed the tentative list of 18 resourceservice pairs suggested by MOE after 
discussions with the national consultant 
and retained them. 
The 15 expert team members met in the 
third week of September 2012 to review the 
18 templates. The team reduced the initial 18 resource-service pairs to 15. It further 
evaluated the 15 resource-service pairs and 
requested that they be subject to further 
scrutiny and prioritisation. 
A national workshop held on 18 December 
2012 prioritised the 15 templates and 
selected five manageable short- to 
medium-term priority resource-service 
pairs. The workshop also identified and 
recommended a set of seven concrete 
action points to resolve limited systemic, 
institutional and individual capacity 
constraints. Resolving these will create 
good synergies and have a positive cumulative effect on the country’s readiness to 
scale up RE deployment. The five priority 
resource-service pairs and action points 
are detailed in section 3.
This report is structured in five substantive 
sections. Section 1 presents the introduction covering country background, IRENA
RRA methodology and the RRA process 
in The Gambia. Section 2 presents the 
renewable and general energy context in 
the region. It includes an overview of the 
energy sector in The Gambia, its challenges 
and an overview of RE potential and use. It 
also provides a detailed discussion of the 
electricity sector. Section 3 explores The 
Gambia’s energy institutions and the policy 
and regulatory framework as well as the 
conditions of financing and investment in 
the country. Section 4 presents the emerging concerns relating to solar/wind electricity (on-grid), a range of decentralised (offgrid) applications as well as the biomass 
sector. Opportunities and constraints that 
affect deployment scale-up are discussed 
along with the RRA findings. Section 5 
presents the recommended action necessary for scaling up RE in The Gambia. The 
Annex presents a detailed account of the 
recommended actions identified by the 
RRA. II. ENERGY CONTEXT
Regional context
The total population of the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS) region1
 in 2011 was about 309m and growing at an annual 
rate of about 2.6% (UNESCO, 2012). Per capita GDP remains low by world 
levels at USD 983, but variations between countries point to a wide range: 
USD 245-3171. Real GDP growth has generally remained strong over the 
past decade and reached 6.9% in 2012 due to good rainfall and positive 
developments in the mining and petroleum sectors (ECOWAS, 2013). 
The West African energy system faces a number of interrelated 
challenges: low energy access, unstable energy security and increasing 
environmental degradation. Total primary energy consumption in the 
region is about 155m tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE) per year (ECREEE, 
2012). Fuelwood and charcoal account for the largest sources of energy, 
representing 77% of primary energy consumption. Petroleum products 
account for 22m tonnes of petroleum equivalent (MTEP) of consumption. As a whole the region consumes about 43 terawatt hours (TWh) 
of electricity. Sustained economic growth in the past few years has 
been accompanied by a growing demand for energy modernisation; 
governments are under pressure to enhance their energy production to 
meet growing demand. 
Access to electricity in the ECOWAS region is low at 42% (ECREEE, 2012). 
Variations also exist between countries. Some, such as Ghana, Côte 
d’Ivoire, Cape Verde, Senegal and Nigeria, are doing better than others in 
extending electricity services to their populations. The volume of unmet 
electricity demand was approximately 7-10 TWh in 2006-2010 (ECREEE, 
2012).
1 ECOWAS is a regional group of 15 countries and was founded in 1975.
Its mission is to promote economic integration in all areas of economic activity, particularly 
industry, transport, telecommunications, energy, agriculture, natural resources, commerce, 
monetary and financial questions, social and cultural matters. ECOWAS member states 
consist of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, GuineaBissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.The electricity systems in West Africa 
also face challenges arising from existing 
supply capacities unable to satisfy growing demand. Furthermore, the region also 
faces the difficulty of raising sufficient 
funds internally or attracting outside investors willing to incur the high perceived risk 
for its electricity sector. Overall, unreliable 
power holds back the region's enterprises 
and impacts negatively on productive activities. Transmission and distribution losses 
are estimated to be around 30%, increasing 
electricity tariffs significantly. A number of 
countries in the region have some of the 
highest tariffs in the world with a regional 
average exceeding USD 0.20/kWh. The 
cost of providing backup power (typically 
USD 0.30-0.40/ kWh) handicaps productive industries. The World Bank (2010) 
estimates that blackouts reduce annual 
economic growth in Africa by 2%. 
Concerns regarding energy access 
and security are not new in the region. 
Following the adoption of the first energy 
policy of ECOWAS, the region has been 
engaged since 1982 in developing an integrated approach of the energy sector. This 
would provide better access to modernised 
energy services for populations across 
the region. Several measures have been 
taken in this direction. Some of these are 
discussed below. 
The West African Power Pool (WAPP) was 
established in 1999 with the aim of curtailing the power deficit prevalent in the region. 
It did this by integrating the operations 
of national power systems into a unified 
regional electricity market (cross-border 
trade flows). This is intended to facilitate 
stable, reliable and cost-competitive electricity supply to all ECOWAS citizens in the 
medium to long term. In 2006, the WAPP 
Secretariat was created and mandated to 
ensure the promotion and development of 
power generation and transmission facilities (www.ecowapp.org). 
The Energy Protocol was adopted in 2003 
by ECOWAS member countries. This is a 
legal framework aimed at promoting longterm energy cooperation. It is based on 
complementary relationships and mutual 
benefits to increase investment in the 
energy sector and develop energy trade in 
the region (ECOWAS, 2003).
The ECOWAS/West African Economic and 
Monetary Union (UEMOA) White Paper 
for a Regional Policy on Access to Energy 
Services to Rural and Semi-Urban Areas 
was adopted in 2006. Three targets were 
set for 2015: 
i) 100% of the total population, or 325 
million people, to have access to 
improved cooking fuels and stoves, 
including 9.2% to Liquefied Petroleum 
Gas (LPG) cooking devices 
ii) at least 60% of people in rural areas 
to have access to productive energy 
services in villages, in particular motive 
power to boost the productivity of 
economic activities 
iii) 66% of the population, or 214 million 
people, to have access to an individual 
electricity supply (ECOWAS, 2006).
The Regulatory Authority for Regional 
Electricity Sector of ECOWAS (ERERA) 
was created in 2008. Its aim was to ensure 
the regulation of cross-border exchanges 
in electricity and provide substantial 
support for national electricity regulators 
of member states (www.erera.arrec.org).
The ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy 
and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) was established by the Council of ECOWAS in 2009. 
Its mandate was to promote measures to 
improve access to modern energy services, 
increase energy security and reduce 
adverse impacts on the environment. The 
creation of favourable framework condi-���������

and energy efficiency are viewed as tools 
to achieve these goals.
Much effort will be required to address 
the energy issues in the region and capitalise on the opportunities that clearly lie 
ahead. ECREEE developed and adopted in 
November 2012 the ECOWAS Renewable 
Energy Policy (EREP). The EREP is designed to make RE a vector for universal 
access to electricity by 2030. It is also 
intended to ensure a more secure and 
sustainable supply of domestic energy 
for cooking. This will meet the objectives 
of the ECOWAS white paper for access to 
modern energy services by 2020.
WEST AFRICAN POWER POOL 
WAPP is looking at developing a regional 
electricity market through successive 
stages:
Phase 1, starting in 2012, is when most 
regional transmission infrastructure is 
expected to be commissioned. This phase 
includes formalising trading arrangements, 
agreeing transmission pricing and strengthening the role of the regional regulator.
Phase 2 is based on the preparations carried 
out during Phase 1. It should include bilateral agreements on transit through third 
countries, short-term exchanges through 
day-ahead markets, regional transmission pricing and regional system operator/
market operator functions.
Phase 3 reflects a long-term vision, which 
includes regional optimisation of operations. WAPP has approved a regional 
master plan for infrastructure development 
with timings for the different projects. This 
master plan is organised around 30 generation and 26 transmission priority projects 
with an objective of developing 10% RE
(excluding large hydro). The implementation of the master plan will add an additional 
capacity of 10 000 megawatts (MW) and 
16 000 km of transmission lines to the 
region. This would consist of an electricity 
mix of 21 hydropower plants, five thermal 
power plants and four RE plants (wind and 
solar) 
From a purely economic standpoint, a 
number of countries would benefit from 
the opportunity to reduce costs they incur 
at present by importing more than half 
their power. Savings for countries such 
as Guinea Bissau, Liberia and Niger could 
range from USD 0.05/kWh to 0.08/kWh 
(Eberhard et al., 2011). The largest beneficiaries of regional trade would be smaller 
nations that lack domestic hydropower 
resources. For these countries, it is estimated that the cost savings generated by 
regional trade could repay the required 
investment in cross-border transmission 
within less than a year. This depends on 
neighbouring countries developing sufficient surplus power to export.
Within the priority projects at the regional 
level, The Gambia would participate in both 
generation and transmission in its capacity 
as a member country of The Gambia River 
Basin Development Organisation (OMVG)2. 
Two generation and one transmission project are to be implemented in the subregion. 
These include a 128 MW hydropower dam 
in Senegal (Sambangalou) and a 240 MW 
hydropower dam in Guinea (Kaleta). It also 
includes a 225 kilovolt (kV) transmission 
line of 1 677 km that interconnects the four

government of Guinea has already launched 
the construction of the Kaleta Dam while 
the financial and economic analysis for the 
Sambagalou Dam is being concluded and 
is showing positive results. 
Energy supply and 
demand in The Gambia
The Gambia has a dual energy system 
containing co-existing traditional and 
modernised energy systems and practices. 
On the one hand, traditional biomass fuels 
and inefficient technologies dominate 
household energy needs. On the other, a 
modernised energy system uses electricity 
and more refined fuels as well as modern 
appliances. There is also an urban/rural 
split in terms of energy distribution and 
practices. However, the boundary between 
what is up-to-date and what is traditional 
is not clearly demarcated. For example, in 
urban centres in The Gambia, the simultaneous use of biomass fuels, kerosene or 
LPG is common, even in relatively highincome households. The fragmented nature 
of the energy system creates enormous 
challenges for policy makers and makes it 
difficult to overcome the energy challenge 
in an integrated manner. 
In 2010, Total Energy Supply (TES) in The 
Gambia was 407 926 TOE. The energy 
consumption per capita in The Gambia in 
2007 was 81 kilogrammes of oil equivalent (KGOE) according to figures from the 
Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the 
United Nations Industrial Development 
Organisation (UNIDO) in 2011. Biomass, 
Figure 2
Total Primary Energy Supply by Fuelincluding fuelwood, accounts for about 
63% of the country’s energy supply, and 
for more than 90% of household energy 
consumption. It comes to as much as 97% 
in some rural areas. 
Petroleum products consisting of LPG for 
cooking and diesel and Heavy Fuel Oil 
(HFO) for generating electricity account 
for 37%. The share of RE is negligible at 
0.19% and is mainly solar. In 2006 The 
Gambia imported 128 000 metric tonnes 
(mt) of petroleum products. This had been 
an increasing trend since 1995 (figure 2). 
The two biggest energy consumers are 
households and the transport sector. LPG 
use has been increasing in urban areas, but 
only marginally. Its use has been largely 
constrained by its high cost. 
Fuel imports cause major problems for 
Gambian policy makers as they use up 
what little foreign exchange the country generates. In 2009, the country spent 
USD 47m on petroleum imports. This 
amounts to a share of about 15.5% of total 
imports. Furthermore, the energy intensity 
of The Gambia is about 0.51, which is around 
the ECOWAS average but significantly 
higher than that obtained in developed 
and emerging economies. As an example, 
China’s energy intensity amounted to 0.46, 
and the European Union (EU) and Japan 
had values of 0.11 and 0.09 respectively 
(ECREEE, 2012). The high energy intensity 
points to the fact that ample opportunities 
exist for The Gambia to engage in energy 
efficiency improvements (from production 
to end use).

transmission and distribution
The Gambia relies entirely on imported 
fossil fuel for electricity generation - mainly 
HFO - for the main power plants and diesel 
for the provincial power stations. These are 
operated by National Water and Energy 
Company (NAWEC) and Global Electric 
Group (GEG) - an Independent Power 
Producer (IPP). 
Effective installed capacity in The Gambia 
is around 65 MW. This is divided into two 
generation and transmission categories. 
The first comprises the Greater Banjul area 
which is supplied by two large HFO power 
stations in Kotu (25 MW at peak load), 
Brikama (26 MW) and the Batakunku and 
Tanji wind power plants (120 kW/150 kilovolt ampere (kVA) and 900 kVA respectively). The Brikama, Batakunku and Tanji 
are IPP plants respectively owned by GEG 
and Gamwind. Electricity is transmitted 
from these stations for distribution via five 
radial 11 kV feeders and three 33 kV feeders. The second category of power supply 
comprises seven NAWEC owned smallscale power plants that operate on diesel 
generator sets, served by stand-alone electricity subsystems in the provincial centres 
(table 1). Together, these small-scale 
plants have an installed capacity of about 
13.75 MW (PURA, 2013). Approximately 
250 km of 30 kV transmission lines are 
installed in the provincial grids plus 135 km 
of MV/LV lines and 94 km of LV overhead 
lines.
Approximately 44% of the electricity 
produced is consumed by households. 
Small-scale industries, hotels and larger 
industries use approximately 39% and 
commercial entities about 8%. The remainFigure 3

Authority (PURA) 2012ing 9% is consumed by government and 
NAWEC (NAWEC, 2011). Demand for 
power continues to rise. In 2012, generation 
amounted to 232 gigawatt hours (GWh) 
against an estimated electricity demand 
of 621 GWh and is expected to exceed 
800 GWh by 2020. This gap between 
demand and supply is further exacerbated 
by system losses of about 30%. Table 2 
summarises the evolution of the structure 
of the electricity market in 2007-2011 in 
terms of consumer population, power sales, 
system losses, power and energy demand.
Load shedding is frequent. Its common 
practice for businesses, hotels and health 
facilities to rely on on-site diesel generation units and occasionally solar photovoltaic (PV) units when load shedding or 
outages occur. Data on these backup offTable 2

Source: NAWEC, 2011grid systems are not available. The resulting effect of this system underperformance 
is high tariffs for consumers and a rise in 
the number of back-up systems. It also 
weakens the financial position of NAWEC, 
thereby reducing its capability to raise 
sufficient revenue to expand the electricity system beyond the Greater Banjul area. 
This has wider economic implications. The 
lack of reliable, affordable power and the 
high cost of energy are seriously limiting 
investment in The Gambia and are limiting growth in productive sectors such as 
the agro-processing and manufacturing 
sectors (GEF/UNIDO, 2011).
National electricity access is about 35%, 
concentrated in the Greater Banjul area 
where access is about 93% (table 3). 
Recognizing the high suppressed demand 
and a weakness in the transmission and 
distribution network, NAWEC has projected 
the need for 75MW of additional capacity 
in the next three years. It also estimates a 
need for additional capacity of 135MW in 
2014-2020 (government of The Gambia, 
2012). The financial requirement between 
2013 and 2015 will amount to USD 112.5m 
and USD 182m in 2016-2020. New transmission lines consisting of a 132kV power 
line between the two main power stations 
(Kotu and Brikama) are also planned in the 
Greater Banjul. They are expected to be in 
place by the end of 2013. 
Costs and tariffs
Following an extensive review, tariffs in The 
Gambia were increased by 17% in 2011. At 
present, consumers pay the highest electricity tariffs in the West Africa region at 
USD 0.28/kWh (table 4). This situation 
can be explained partly by the country’s 
reliance on imported fossil fuels for electricity generation, as well as its poor transmission and distribution infrastructure.

costs are passed onto consumers, resulting 
in high tariffs. Nevertheless, tariffs are not 
reflective of costs, and the utility has been 
experiencing major financial difficulties. 
Resources allocated to cover operation and 
maintenance costs are inadequate.
The typical distance of villages from 
the grid in The Gambia is 5-25 km. The 
cost of transmission lines to connect 
these communities with low electricity 
demand to the grid could amount to USD 
50 000-100 000/km. While this is a financial liability for the utility it opens a window 
of opportunity for decentralised generation. This is because the draft RE law also 
offers provision for RE-based entrepreneurs 
as it will make more economic sense than 
grid extension. Furthermore, grid connection fees can amount to USD 230-1800 
(with a median cost of USD 600). This is a 
prohibitive cost for low-income households 
(Sanneh and Hu, 2009). 
Substantial investments are needed to 
meet infrastructure and plant modernisation costs, although the greatest proportion of operating costs are due to the 
high fuel costs. A parallel strategy is also 
important to meet the needs of low energy 
- consuming communities located far from 
the grid. The Gambia has the opportunity 
to create a more cost-effective off-grid RE
supply system. This could play a major role 
in reducing the nation’s dependency on 
imported fossil fuel, diversifying the electricity mix and increasing access to energy 
services. The challenge is to develop a 
policy framework and functioning business 
models that attract investment into a mix 
of on- and off-grid electricity generation. 
To meet these requirements, the government has formulated several strategies. Its 
objectives are to rapidly expand installed 
electricity capacity, expand and upgrade 
the transmission and distribution networks 
and develop renewable sources of energy. 
This consists mainly of solar, wind and 
biomass. 
Four important features characterise 
the energy sector in The Gambia. These 
include: 
i) high dependence on 
imported fossil fuels 
ii) the dominance of traditional biomass 
sources in the country’s energy mix 
iii) low access to modern energy services 
iv) limited investment in new assets 
and inadequate maintenance of 
old and ageing power facilities. 
Renewable energy resource 
potential and use
The energy sector in The Gambia faces 
vexing problems. This country will have 
budgetary constraints for the foreseeable 
future due to its dependence on imported 
fuel and weak supply infrastructure to 
support the desired economic and social 
development. This difficulty is especially 
pronounced in rural areas, which are 
generally characterised by widespread 
poverty, low income, low demand and the 
inherent disadvantage of being further 
from the grid. For these communities, an 
increased reliance on local energy sources 
at a decentralised level is needed to meet 
emerging energy needs. 
The Gambia has benefits from a good RE
resource, including considerable solar 
energy and some wind power along 
the coast. It also has considerable land 
area classified as forest. At present, this 
provides biomass energy for a significant proportion of the population but could be 
managed more sustainably. A summary of 
the resource and potential available in The 
Gambia is provided below. It is based on 
the Renewable Energy Master Plan (REMP) 
drawn up in 2006 under the direction of 
the Energy Division of the Office of the 
President.
Solar energy resources
Solar radiation data was collected through 
REMP at eight measurement stations spread 
across the country. The study concluded 
that The Gambia enjoys high solar radiation in all regions with average solar radiation at 4.4-6.7 kWh/m2/day (figure 4). The 
periods of high insolation are between 
March and May when the diurnal variation 
between the minimum and maximum radiation values is small. The lowest radiation 
values are in December and January, which 
coincides with the rainy season. Even during 
the rainy season, much of the country 
receives sufficient amounts of solar radiation at about 5 kWh/m2/day. However, the 
solar radiation range is higher due to cloud 
cover. Low values are still good enough for 
solar energy applications. 
Solar energy applications currently in use in 
The Gambia include: PV for off-grid applications and solar water heating for homes, 
hotels and community applications. 
Numerous PV systems are in use across 
The Gambia for rural off-grid electrification and water pumping purposes in places 
unlikely to be reached by the grid. The 
government and donors have funded most

Figure 4 
Solar radiation in The Gambia
Source: Gambia REMP 2005of The Gambia’s PV investments as part 
of rural energy service projects for health 
clinics, schools, households and street 
lighting. With funding from the EU and 
the Japanese government, local private 
company Gam-Solar has installed solar 
pumping systems in about 80 villages. This 
provides clean potable water to more than 
200 000 people. 
There is little private sector activity in the 
solar PV sector, and active commercial 
markets are yet to develop. The government has encouraged the PV market by 
introducing a duty exemption for solar 
equipment. However, more policy and 
regulatory push would be needed to attract 
private sector participation in the PV field. 
The GEF/UNIDO study (2011) has identified 
a number of good opportunities in the PV 
sector, including the introduction of PV in 
some of the diesel-operated isolated grids 
()
Source: IRENA Global Atlas
The Gambiarun by NAWEC in the provincial areas. 
Installing PV power plants at these locations could reduce the running costs of 
these grids, and allow expansion of the 
system to run for 24 hours a day. 
Solar water heating systems have been 
operational in The Gambia for nearly two 
decades, and there is ample experience 
and expertise in the country for installing these systems. Gam-Solar has carried 
out numerous installations in hotels and 
community centres such as rural clinics. 
However with the exception of a few, most 
hotels continue to use electricity or fuel oil 
boilers to heat water. 
Potential investment in grid-connected

parts of the world. The Gambia’s high electricity generation cost is likely to excite 
investor interest in PV on the grid. However, 
grid PV remains a capital-intensive venture 
that will require government direction to 
create the appropriate institutional and 
regulatory framework. This would partly 
lower investment risks and therefore attract 
private sector players. 
Wind energy resources
Wind potential in The Gambia was evaluated using data from the World Wind Atlas 
to prepare a Zero-Wind Map. This was 
further refined using data gathered from 
eight measurement stations throughout 
the country. Data were collected at 30m 
height over an eight month period including the Harmatan dry wind period. The 
study concluded that wind conditions are 
moderate in the interior part of the country (less than 4.0 m/s), but rise to average wind speeds of about 4.3 m/s mainly 
due to wind flow from the sea in the West. 
Figure 6 shows the wind regime in three of 
these sites. 
While inland areas may be restricted mainly 
for wind pumping purposes, there is growing evidence that some coastal areas offer 
opportunities for grid-connected power 
generation. A combination of suitable wind 
turbine technology and the judicious integration of wind power to the existing grid 
in the Greater Banjul Area is an option. It 
is also important to highlight other limiting factors with regards to the engineering work associated with large wind 
generation plants with high turbine hubs. 
Transportation and craning infrastructure 
for large-scale wind turbines beyond 35 
metres is at present not available in The 
Gambia. However, if the wind programme 
expands in future, this could be met by 
self-erecting turbines or by bringing in 
adequate cranes.
The Gambia
Figure 6 
Monthly wind speed at 30m in three sites in The GambiaThere is limited experience in wind-related 
energy projects in The Gambia. Much of 
the early work was restricted to village 
water pumping projects. In the 1990s, the 
Department of Water Resources (DWR) 
actively promoted the use of wind pumps 
along coastal villages with support from 
the EU. The pilot systems were installed in 
three villages, but their operation has been 
discontinued due to lack of proper maintenance, and pumping systems inappropriate for the local conditions. Several other 
wind pumps are in use across the country, 
mostly on private farms. This clearly indicates that capacity development in operation and maintenance (O&M) is critical for 
sustaining wind pumping programmes. 
Similar experiences are also observed in 
other parts of Africa.
Figure 7

The GambiaIn recent years, wind power has generated 
some interest in multilateral institutions, 
donors and The Gambian government. 
The Batakunku wind project was the first 
of its kind in The Gambia to generate electricity for local community use and supply 
surplus power to the utility. Annual generation is currently around 120 000 kWh. A
follow-up project started up in August 2012 
further north in Tanji. 
Biomass
The Gambia has a rich variety of woodland 
ecosystems, including forests, closed and 
open woodland, tree and shrub savannah, 
mangrove, riparian and fringing savannah. 
The Gambia’s forest cover has declined 
from 60% in the 1960s to 43% of the 
land area today (Jarju, 2008). Its forest 
and woodland ecosystems supply about 
85% of domestic energy requirements. 
Fuelwood accounts for more than 90% 
of household energy consumption and is 
often used in inefficient stoves. The REMP 
study conducted one of the most comprehensive fuelwood consumption investigations. It concluded that the standing 
stock of fuelwood would not be enough to 
meet future demand. In 2005 the technical 
potential for sustainable fuelwood production was about 209 000 tonnes/year for an 
aggregated demand of 734 400 tonnes/
year resulting in a huge gap of about 
535 000 tonnes/year (Jarju, 2008). This has 
led to overexploitation and degradation of 
native forest, as well as fuel imports from 
Senegal largely in the form of charcoal. 
Given the favourable soil and climate as 
well as underground water conditions in 
The Gambia, there is ample opportunity 
to establish highly productive and intensively managed wood lots. These could 
replace wood imports and ease the pressure on natural forests. Although such 
Source: Ministry of Energy, The Gambiaplanned and managed biomass schemes 
will not in themselves close the biomass 
gap, they could form part of a comprehensive and sustainable biomass programme. 
This would include improved cookstoves to 
reduce demand. 
Apart from solid biomass, The Gambia 
produces a significant amount of agricultural residues that have the potential to 
make a meaningful contribution to energy 
needs. Most crops in The Gambia are 
subsistence crops (rice, millet, maize and 
sorghum) with groundnuts as the only cash 
crop. Agricultural production data provides 
the basis for calculating the annual amount 
of residues produced and their corresponding energy potential (Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), 2011). 
Millet and maize have the highest potential and this has been estimated at 
3000 terajoules (TJ) per year and 1200 TJ/
year respectively (table 5). However the 
residues for these crops are widely used 
for animal fodder and for various household uses. 
Hence, the only real potential may lie in the 
use of groundnut residue through centralised groundnut processing facilities across 
the country. This would produce heat and 
electricity to meet local energy needs. 
Surplus would be sold to the grid.

FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY
Key energy stakeholders 
and institutional structures
There are numerous players in The Gambian energy sector. They include 
government bodies and parastatal organisations, Non-Governmental 
Organisations (NGOs) and associations as well as the private sector. 
Some of these play multiple roles in policy, regulation, finance, knowledge generation and advocacy. 
Government/public-sector institutions
The Office of the President plays a crucial role in receiving information 
from all the ministries as they relate to each specific energy objective. It 
has final authority on regulations, tariffs and IPP contracting. 
The MOE, under the Office of the President, is tasked with the responsibility for establishing the policy and strategies for the energy sector. This 
includes electricity, petroleum products and RE. The MOE is aided by the 
Energy Unit (EU) and GREC who provide support on policy analysis and 
technical matters. The utility National Water and Electricity Company 
(NAWEC) and the IPP GEG work under the MOE.
The National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC) owns all except 
the GEG power plant and operates the transmission and distribution 
network for the country. NAWEC is responsible for establishing and 
collecting electricity tariffs. It also establishes and administers Power 
Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with the private power producer and 
implements rural electrification projects.
The Ministry of Finance receives recommendations from PURA, evaluates the financial implications and makes recommendations to the president. The ministry is involved in pricing petroleum products especially 
for the transport sector. Liquid petroleum products provide a significant 
revenue stream for the national budget.PURA is responsible for regulating the 
electricity, water and telecommunications 
sectors. This includes licensing and ensuring safety and quality standards as well as 
tariff reviews. PURA is actively engaged in 
drafting the RE bill and in formulating and 
communicating the FIT rules. It also acts as 
arbitrator between the responsible network 
utility and people generate or plant to 
generate electricity from RE resources. 
The Ministry of Petroleum oversees 
upstream and downstream activities in 
petroleum resources, in particular exploration and marketing. The ministry oversees 
the quality of service and safety standards within the petroleum subsector. It is, 
however, unclear which ministry has oversight responsibility for LPG.
The Ministry of Forestry and Environment 
(MOFEN) is responsible for enacting forestry 
and environmental policies and legislation. 
Its forestry department is responsible for 
managing the country’s forest resources. It 
plays a lead role in policy formulation and 
regulation. 
The Department of Community Development (DCD) is under the Ministry of 
Local Government and Lands. It is responsible for promoting the efficient management of fuelwood resources through the 
promotion of substitutes and improved 
end-use appliances for firewood at the 
household level. 
The department is also involved in community training activities in a wide range of 
sectors as well as research and dissemination of new and appropriate technology. 
The Gambia Investment and Export 
Promotion Agency (GIEPA) has the primary 
function of investment promotion in The 
Gambia. Energy is among the eligible 
sectors in The Gambian investment code.
The Department of Water Resources 
(DWR) in the Ministry of Water Resources 
and Fisheries is actively involved in rural 
water supply using solar energy for water 
pumping.
Private-sector institutions
GEG is an IPP contracted by NAWEC to 
build, own, operate and maintain one of 
the two power generators in the Greater 
Banjul Area.
With a current membership of 17-19 enterprises, the Renewable Energy Association 
of The Gambia (REAGAM) promotes RE
projects. These include small solar PV 
installations, solar thermal, micro hydro, 
cookstove improvements and the expansion of jatropha for oil production in 
The Gambia.
Universities and 
research institutions
GREC advises government on RE and 
energy efficiency. It was set up to carry 
out adaptive research in RE and to develop 
and promote the use of RE and energy efficiency technologies in The Gambia. 
University of The Gambia (UTG) is responsible for offering training programmes 
energy-related courses. It also carries out 
installation of community solar projects 
on a contract basis. It has limited research 
capabilities due to lack of resources.
Gambia Technical Training Institute (GTTI) 
is responsible for research, development 
and training in RE and energy efficiency 
appliances.
National Agricultural Research Institute 
(NARI) is responsible for research, development and dissemination of RE technologies, mainly solar and biomass.Energy policies and 
regulatory framework
PAGE is The Gambia’s development strategy and investment programme for 2012-
2015, geared towards accelerating propoor growth and generating employment. 
One of the important pillars of PAGE is the 
urgency to improve and modernise The 
Gambia’s infrastructure through public and 
private sector investments in transport, 
energy and information and communications technology. 
More specifically, PAGE established the 
goal of promoting the use of RE resources 
for electricity generation and actively 
pursuing fuel-switching from fossil to RE, 
particularly in rural areas. 
There are four key laws and strategies in 
place that affect the energy sector: the 
Public Utility Regulatory Act (2001), Energy 
Policy (2005), Electricity Act (2005), and 
the GIEPA Act (2010). 
The Public Utility Regulatory Act established PURA as the body responsible for 
the regulation of public utilities including energy services (electricity, petroleum 
and gas). The act was designed to enable 
licensing arrangements to be administered by an independent and self-funding 
regulatory body that protects the interests 
of the public utilities and consumers. The 
emergence of PURA has improved transparency and utility accountability. The 
Energy Policy (2005) stipulates the need 
to ensure a reliable and adequate supply of 
Source: Ministry of Energy, The Gambiaenergy at affordable prices. This is essential to stimulate necessary development 
in the productive sectors of the economy 
and to realise the development aspirations 
of The Gambia in an environment-friendly 
way. More specifically, the policy aims to 
i) improve and expand existing energy 
supply systems through private sector 
partnerships with the public sector 
ii) promote a domestic fuel subsector, 
which clearly focuses on sustainable 
management of forest resources 
iii) widen the population’s access to 
modernised forms of energy to stimulate development and reduce poverty 
iv) strengthen institutional and human 
resource capacity and enhance 
Research and Development (R&D) in 
energy and 
v) provide adequate energy security. 
The policy has worked as a major step 
supporting the implementation of RE
systems. 
The Electricity Act of 2005 was passed to 
promote cost-effective generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, set 
standards for electricity services and determine appropriate tariffs. It also opened the 
generation sector to IPPs. The act designates PURA as the authority over licensing 
and tariff setting for electricity generation 
and sales. It also elaborates the framework that provides for the participation of 
the private sector in electricity generation 
while transmission and distribution still falls 
under the public utility’s monopoly. 
The GIEPA Act of 2010 has been a welcome 
addition to The Gambia’s policy landscape. In relation to the power sector, The 
Gambian Investment and Export Promotion 
Agency (established under the GIEPA Act, 
2010, formerly GIPZFA) provides incentives to enterprises. Priority sectors include 
RE from solar, wind, hydro and biochemical energy as well as LPG and electricity 
generation, transmission and distribution. 
Some of the incentives include a corporation tax holiday for a period of five years 
and a waiver on import sales tax relating to 
manufacturing plant. This would complement the much awaited RE law in making 
the energy playing field attractive to local 
and international investors.
During the course of 2012, the draft 
Electricity Strategy and Action Plan and 
the RE bill were developed by the ministry 
with the assistance of technical partners.
The draft Electricity Strategy and Action 
Plan considered different pathways for the 
national electricity sector including business as usual, enabling cross-border trade, 
renewable generation and reliability, and 
high RE integration. In order to help policy 
decisions the draft strategy recommends 
regional interconnection and a joint hydropower project with neighbouring countries. 
This allows for greater renewables integration in both the main and isolated grids. 
The plan is to integrate the isolated grids 
to the main grid over time. 
The draft RE bill was validated in December 
2012 and is to be presented before the 
National Assembly members for adoption. 
It will provide the legal framework for an 
efficient promotion of RE resources and is 
considered a major milestone in delivering 
some of the key priorities in PAGE 2012-
2015. A number of national stakeholders 
will play a part in rolling out the act. MOE is 
to recommend national targets for the use 
of RE resources. The Ministry of Finance 
and Economic Affairs (MOFEA) is to 
provide tax exemptions to RE equipment and electricity generated through renewable. Meanwhile, PURA is to implement the 
regulatory framework that includes defining the rules for pricing renewable electricity (FITs), setting up and managing the 
RE fund. 
The RE fund objective is to provide financial resources for the promotion of RE by 
providing financial incentives, FITs, capital 
subsidies, production-based subsidies and 
equity participation. These will support both 
on-grid and off-grid initiatives and investments. An attractive FIT rate will be introduced for on-grid investors. Alternatively, 
they will benefit from a negotiated rate no 
higher than the alternative cost of electricity generation. For off-grid investors, 
it ensures that electricity from renewables 
and hybrid systems may be sold to endusers at approved electricity tariffs up to 
the current national retail tariff rates. This 
excludes generation facilities greater than 
200 kW.
Financing and investment
As with other countries in West Africa, 
donor assistance in The Gambia represents 
the majority of the energy sector investments. There are currently eight discrete 
projects at various stages of preparation/
implementation. They are divided into 
three sets of energy sector development 
programmes, namely generation, transmission and distribution and RE development programmes. The 
financing institutions for 
these projects comprise 
banks such as the Islamic 
Development Bank 
(IDB), the Investment 
and Development Bank 
of ECOWAS (EBID) 
and the Arab Bank for 
Economic Development 
in Africa (BADEA). It 
also includes the OPEC 
Fund for International 
Development (OFID), 
the Economic and 
Social Development 
Bank of Venezuela 
(BANDES) and investors like GEF-UNIDO, 
the Danish International 
Development Agency 
(DANIDA) and the 
German International Cooperation Agency 
(GIZ). The total budget is USD 112.86m 
(USD 7.7m for the only RE project, two 
wind turbines of 900 kVA, developed so 
far). Government contributions towards 
these projects are in the form of counterpart funds mainly arising from internallygenerated sources such as direct and indirect taxes, international trade taxes and 
non-tax revenues. The government also 
regularly borrows from international and 
local financial markets to finance energy 
projects.
Source: Ministry of Energy, The GambiaIn order to attract domestic and foreign 
investments in the main sectors of the 
economy including electricity generation/
distribution and RE, the government of The 
Gambia has adopted two main policies. 
These are the Investment Promotion Policy 
and the 2001 Free Zone Act. 
The Gambia Investment Promotion and 
Free Zones Agency has been established 
and provides a mandate to lay out the 
investment promotion framework. The 
framework stipulates national treatment 
and equity participation of foreign investors by assuring them security of title. 
It also guarantees against expropriation. 
Investors have also been offered an attractive incentives package including exemptions from import duties and tax holidays. 
Privileges arising from any existing or future 
customs union, free trade area, monetary 
union or similar international cooperation 
are also available to investors.
Under the Free Zone Act, free zones are 
being developed in selected locations. 
Activities and investment in these locations 
attract incentives for a period of 1-30 years 
depending on the duration of the licence. 
These incentives include, among other 
things, exemptions from capital registration payment and import duty on capital 
equipment, excise duty and sale of goods 
and dividend tax. 
The financial market institutions in The 
Gambia are well positioned to play a key 
investment role in scaling up RE deployment. There are 12 commercial banks operating. These could act as a vibrant avenue 
for investment resources for private entrepreneurs in the renewable technology 
market. 
Similarly, The Gambia Microfinance Network 
(GAMFINET), with a membership of 17 
NGOs, can channel credit for the purchase 
renewable technologies by their individual members. While the majority of these 
NGOs are facilitators, five are currently 
active in savings and/or credit mobilisation 
with good track records and wide coverage in the rural areas. These are Reliance 
Financial Services, Social Development 
Fund, Gambians for Self Employment, 
Gambia Women’s Finance Association and 
National Association of Cooperative Credit 
Unions of The Gambia.
The private sector in The Gambia has yet to 
show an inclination towards RE businesses. 
Local banks as well as microfinance institutions are averse to building a portfolio of 
RE projects since their understanding of 
technology risk is limited. 
Moreover, most of the local banks lack 
capacity to plan, structure and appraise 
a RE project with appropriate financial 
instruments. Combined with inadequate 
awareness, this reinforces the perception 
of RE technologies as too expensive, lacking reliability and thus too risky. 
This may change when the Renewable 
Energy Act comes into force, ushering in 
the RE fund. This will be the responsibility of PURA, providing financial incentives, FITs, capital subsidies, production 
based subsidies and equity participation 
to renewable-based electricity projects. 
Sources for financing the fund will include 
the national budget, multilateral and bilateral donors, donations, and various levies. 
The money from the RE Fund would also 
be available for, among other things, the 
promotion of RE projects including capacity building for RE development. The 
government of The Gambia should take the 
opportunity to build the technical capacities of local financial institutions and the 
private sector as well as civil society. This 
will affect business opportunities within 
the sector. A solar powered NGO farm in Nema Kunk in The Gambia

RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE GAMBIA
The RE market is largely subject to the resources available and the technologies that can be employed to convert energy sources into services. 
This section is divided into different subsections focusing on different 
resources and conversion technologies, known here as service-resource 
pairs. In each subsection, the status of each particular subsector is 
reviewed, followed by the problems that need to be solved and concluding with a list of action points recommended by the RRA.
Grid-connected renewable energy options
The grid remains an important way to reach large numbers of people 
at low cost. The situation in The Gambia is such that the grid is faced 
with formidable technical, institutional and financial barriers. Less than 
35% of people are served by the grid, and the lack of reliable, affordable power is seriously hampering investment in The Gambia. This limits 
growth in critical productive sectors such as the agro-processing. A
number of RE technologies are becoming increasingly cost-competitive. 
Their development could help unblock the impasse by enabling diversification of supply and building resilience in power infrastructure. This 
section considers wind and PV for The Gambia. They offer high immediate deployment potential.
On-grid wind
There is at present one grid-connected wind power generator with a 
capacity of 120 kW (150 kVA) that has been operating at Batokunku since 
2009. There are also two 450 kW wind turbines at Tanji that started up 
in late 2012. All three were installed by a local company (Gamwind), and 
GEF/UNIDO provided part of the funds for the Tanji project. Uniquely, 
the turbines were acquired second-hand from Europe where they had 
been operating in a wind farm. They were refurbished in The Gambia. 
This explains why project lifetimes are reduced to 15 years instead of 
the 20-25 years average for new systems. The cost of acquiring these 
turbines is estimated to be 50-75% lower than new turbines of similar 
quality and size.
The investment cost for the plant at Batokunku was about USD 220 000 
and is expected to have a lifetime service of about 15 years. At Batukunu, some 80% of the power produced is used by 
the village households who purchase electricity at 75% of the utility tariff. Meanwhile 
20% is sold to the utility NAWEC. The benefits from this project have gone beyond 
just the provision of water and electricity. 
A variety of new employment opportunities have been created through self-help 
businesses. 
The Tanji project had a capital cost of 
USD 577 000 and annual running cost of 
USD 36 000. The project is expected 
to generate a total output of about 
572 000 kWh/year. Power is sold to 
NAWEC via a PPA at about USD 0.17/kWh, 
resulting in net income of approximately 
USD 59 000/year. The turbines in Tanji are 
Bonus 450 with a hub height of 35m and 
contain three blades with a rotor diameter 
of 37m. As part of the installations, two 
step-up transformers and a transmission 
line were constructed to connect with the 
coastal 33kV transmission ring operated 
by the national utility company, NAWEC. 
The project used historical wind data 
from the Batakunku wind measurements. 
Wind speed averages 5.51 m/s. In the first 
six months since the turbine started up, 
the system has transferred over 190 MWh 
of power to NAWEC against an annual 
target of 570 MWh (table 6). Referring 
back to figure 2.3, it is important to note 
that August to December is a period of 
low wind. It would therefore be interesting 
to see what the Tanji turbine will generate during the relatively high wind period 
between January and May. 
Financial analysis for the Tanji project uses 
the assumption that all the power generated is fed into the grid at the utility tariff 
of USD 0.28/kWh instead of the actual 
selling price of USD 0.17/kWh. At that rate, 
the Tanji plant would generate an annual 
net income of about USD 124 000 or have 
a simple payback of about 9.1 years on 
investment. Further analysis was undertaken comparing the refurbished turbines 
against new turbines of the same capacity at market rates USD 1200/kW and USD 
3000/kW3 (IRENA, 2013a). The result 
shows a lower levelised cost4 for the refurbished turbines at USD 0.13/kWh over a 15

3 Taken from IRENA Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2012. In figure 4.3, the total installed cost range of 
USD 1000-3000/kW is given as representative for Africa.
4 Assumptions: Capital cost of refurbished system = USD 577 000; capital cost of new systems = USD 1 200/
kW and USD 3 000/kW; annual running cost = USD 36 000 (annual variable cost = USD 0.01/kWh + annual fixed 
cost = USD 30/kW); project time = 15 years; inflation =5%; discount rate =12%.year lifetime. It also shows a levelised cost of 
USD 0.15/kWh and USD 0.35/kWh for new 
systems over a 20 year lifetime (figure 8). 
The analysis also reveals that the cheaper 
option would yield a simple payback time 
of 11 years, and the more expensive wind 
turbine would exceed the payback period 
of its lifetime (20 years). This indicates 
that for more expensive wind options the 
introduction of a FIT would be necessary to 
attract investment. This demonstrates that, 
given the moderate wind regime, wind 
power is still a cost-competitive option, 
especially at the lower end of the capital 
cost price curve.
The Batokunku and Tanji projects are 
designed to address electrification for 
community use and for sale to the grid. 
Meanwhile, a new project is under development. This is part of the effort to 
support enterprises with access to electrification. It involves setting up a 450 kW 
wind turbine to support a fishing community to overcome high energy costs. This 
project is raising funds before being set 
up. The plant will have a capital cost of 
USD 298 000 and an annual running cost 
of USD 15 900. The interesting attribute of 
this project is that the electricity generated 
would be used for productive purposes at 
the Tanji Fishing Community. This community cooperative produces ice, runs chilled 
storage and a fish market and rents shops 
and fish-processing areas. The ice-making and chilling process at the fisheries is 
energy-intensive and uses approximately 
715 000 kWh/year at a cost of about 
USD 170 000/year. This accounts for 80% 
of the production costs (GEF/UNIDO, 2011). 
The Tanji Fishing Community has agreed 
to provide 20% of the costs of the project 
while the rest would need to be obtained 
from various donors. The community 
believes that in the long run, the project 
will reduce its reliance on expensive electricity from the grid and provide significant 
annual savings. These can be reinvested to 
upgrade their operations.
Wind power generation offers an opportunity to improve the electrification rate 
by harnessing the use of locally available 
resources and diversifying the sources, as 
stated in PAGE. This necessitates the development of new business models that overcome the high capital cost often associated 
with RE systems. They lower investment 
risk in order to meaningfully engage the 
private sector. Although positive results 
have been obtained from the experiences 
in Batokunku and Tanji, the market for IPPs 
in the wind sector is yet to open up. The 
much-awaited RE law is expected to overcome some financial challenges through 
the introduction of a FIT, waiver on import 
sales tax and favourable corporation tax 
for RE developers. This would need to be 
complemented by a strong effort in two

administration and management capacity 
in the responsible government agencies. 
Secondly, skills would need to be improved 
in engineering, business, finance, and 
contract negotiations. 
The wind projects have been designed with 
very limited wind data to properly assess 
the suitability of the sites for wind power 
applications. Usually, sites are screened on 
the basis of a wind atlas, validated with 
wind measurements from meteorological 
stations and monitored for about a year 
before wind turbines are installed. This 
procedure was not followed in The Gambian 
sites given the country’s poor meteorological intelligence. The government must 
invest in strengthening its observation 
network and make the necessary preparations to obtain a good understanding of 
the wind regime across the country. 
On-grid PV
Solar resources in The Gambia are excellent, 
and thus offer the opportunity for deploying 
a range of solar technologies at utility-scale 
plants and distributed end-use applications. There has been a rapid fall in the cost 
of PV technology globally, enabling gridbased PV to achieve grid parity in a number 
of markets. It is fast becoming a genuine 
alternative for countries faced with the twin 
challenges of energy access and energy 
security. PV module prices have declined 
sharply from USD 3 700/kWp in 2009 to 
USD 1 200/kWp, making the Balance of 
System (BoS) a crucial determinant of solar 
PV system costs (IRENA, 2013a). These 
trends make PV a compelling product for 
end-users in countries such as The Gambia 
looking to reduce the exposure to the high 
cost and volatile fossil fuel market. 
There is considerable experience of PV 
systems in The Gambia, but all of it is 
restricted to the off-grid PV sector, while 
there is no utility-scale PV system in country. Given The Gambia’s specific power 
sector vulnerabilities, there is a growing 
interest among policy-makers in exploring 
the considerable economies of scale associated with PV-based grid developments. 
A pre-feasibility financial analysis of smallscale (100 kW) and larger scale (1250 MW) 
systems was undertaken to assess the 
cost of different size PV systems under 
resource and macroeconomic conditions in 
The Gambia. Generation costs were used 
from the latest IRENA study5 as the basis 
for the cost assumptions for PV systems 
between USD 3000- 8000/kW. In both 
cases it was assumed that power is supplied 
to NAWEC at the current utility tariff of 
USD 0.28/kWh. 
The analysis demonstrated a number of 
important features of PV grid systems in 
The Gambia. The payback period for the 
smaller system is 12-22 years depending 
on the per kWh system cost. Even more 
favourable figures are obtained for the 
larger system, which produces a payback 
period of 6-17 years. This is also demonstrated in the range of levelised cost results 
where the cost for larger systems are USD 
0.10- 0.25/kWh while the smaller systems 
are USD 0.18-0.32/kWh (figure 9)6. This 
illustrates that the larger PV systems bring 
economy of scale benefits as the marginal 
cost of additional power implies a reduc5 Adapted from IRENA Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2012. In figure 6.7, solar PV installed costs 
in non-OECD regions for utility-scale projects gives an average value of USD 3000/kW and a range of 
USD 2000-7000/kW. In this analysis, the USD 3000-8000/kW range is employed for The Gambia. 
6 Assumptions: Capital range = USD 3000-8000/kW; annual O&M cost = USD 20/kW (for 1.25 MW plant size) 
and USD 30/kW (for 100 kW plant); inverter replacement at 10 yrs = USD 0.11/Wp; project time = 20 years; 
inflation =5%; discount rate =12%.tion in unit costs. Furthermore, present 
generation costs for NAWEC fossil-based 
electricity is at USD 0.28/kWh. This makes 
the PV option attractive from a cost as 
well as security of fuel supply standpoint. 
Indeed, the bulk of the total cost of the PV 
systems is in the initial cost, while fossilbased systems have higher recurrent costs 
over the duration of their lifetime. However, 
as the cost of PV systems continues to fall, 
their value as a reliable and cost-effective 
option for power generation increases, 
particularly for periods of peak electricity 
demand during the day. 
The RE Bill being debated at present 
provides for the acceleration of the development of RE resources through the 
establishment of a tariff system. This is the 
FIT for electricity produced from eligible 
renewable resources. It would need to be 
sufficiently attractive to draw serious investors. At the same time it would need to be 
pegged at a rate which will not adversely 
impact the final consumers of electricity. 
RRA findings
The RRA process has highlighted a number 
of technical opportunities and barriers 
facing the generation and transmission 
infrastructure in The Gambia. The process 
also brought to light some of the institutional, financial and capacity issues that 
continue to bedevil the power sector. These 
are discussed below.
Technical considerations
The power sector faces a dual dilemma. The 
first relates to the ongoing and (increasing) electricity supply shortages due to 
inadequate power generating capacity 
characterised by the aging and high operating cost of generating equipment. In 
addition to these technical shortfalls, the 
utility lacks adequate human capacity in 
critical areas such as power plant management. In 2011, about 99% of the total operating costs of NAWEC went into fuel and 
lubricants as well as energy payment from 
the fuel-based IPP (NAWEC, 2011). This 
left little resources for upgrades and critical refurbishments. The second dilemma 
relates to the issue of power quality as 
unplanned outages cause damage to electrical appliances. The present transmission 
and distribution network is composed of 
MV lines (33kV/11kV) covering 115km and 
181 km respectively. These are dilapidated 
and not able to take significant additional 
power capacity without major upgrades 
and new transmission network development to connect additional generation. 
Variable generation from solar and wind 
sources will create further challenges for 
the energy system. The Gambia does not 
Figure 9 
Levelised cost of generation of different 
scale systems in The Gambiahave a grid code but this is essential to 
ensure RE can obtain priority access to the 
grid, while building in some flexibility in 
forecasting production. 
In 2011, a loan agreement of USD 22m 
was signed between the government of 
The Gambia and Economic and Social 
Development Bank of Venezuela (BANDES) 
to upgrade, rehabilitate and expand the 
network. The first phase of the project has 
been completed and has already led to an 
8% reduction in transmission losses. The 
project is in progress and is likely to significantly reduce losses and subsequently 
improve the finances of the utility. In light 
of these developments, the ability of the 
grid to integrate intermittent power generated by renewables would be higher. The 
assessment of the grid along with the evaluation of the RE economic potential should 
inform policy makers in setting RE targets 
that are both meaningful and achievable. 
Setting RENEWABLE ENERGY targets
The comprehensive RE bill is in the process 
of adoption. Section 4 stipulates setting 
up mid- and long-term national targets for 
deploying RE resources in electricity generation. The MOE would be the designated 
authority for proposing the targets. These 
would need to be tailored for a specific 
technology and/or defined in terms of 
addition to the electricity mix or capacity 
addition. The draft electricity strategy has 
made a recommendation that renewable 
resources contribute to 5% to the electricity generation mix by 2020. However, the 
basis for this target has not been made 
clear. The RRA underlines that the 2005-
2006 solar and wind assessment study in 
The Gambia could serve as a good basis 
for evaluating the economic potential for 
wind and solar systems. This would provide 
some preliminary country-specific costs 
taking into account the recent decrease in 
RE technology costs (IRENA, 2013a costing 
study).
Tariff-setting 
The technical suitability and economic 
viability of integrating renewables into 
the grid go hand in hand. A FIT scheme is 
currently under preparation in The Gambia. 
It has the support of the EU and is based 
on the specific policy and market framework of the country for wind, solar PV and 
biomass. These are identified as the most 
appropriate renewable power options in 
country in the short term. It is designed to 
improve the competitiveness of renewables 
and drive investment into the sector. 
The design of the FIT was based on the 
avoided cost methodology given the 
fact that electricity generation is based 
on imported fossil fuel subject to market 
fluctuation. The proposed FIT is to be 
set at a ceiling price of 8.7 GMD/kWh 
(USD 0.26 /kWh) which is roughly equivalent to the current generation price of 
8.5 GMD/kWh (USD 0.25 /kWh). It will be 
valid for 15 years from plant commissioning. In order to minimise impact on system 
stability, initially the maximum allowable 
plant size for solar PV and wind could be 
limited to 1 MW. Facilities greater than 
1 MW would not be considered under the 
FIT scheme but could negotiate a PPA
directly with the utility. 
Setting up FITs equivalent to present 
generation costs is likely to cause an extra 
burden on NAWEC. It already borrows 
heavily from local banks at high rates to 
meet the current supply. Anticipating this 
challenge, the RE law will set up a fund 
to provide finance for the FITs and other 
RE commitments. This would be covered 
by annual contributions from the national budget, registration fees from commercial organisations and individuals in the 
renewables sector, as well as grants for 
RE activities. Additional resources could 
be raised through the introduction of an 
RE levy on service sectors such as tourism 
and the banking sector that manage remittances. In 2010 The Gambia received up 
to USD 82m in remittances, according to 
Women World’s Banking. The government 
could also consider working with international agencies to develop a credit line for 
community and small business RE or other 
power generation projects.
Although electricity generation has been 
opened to the private sector following 
the 2005 Electricity Act, only two IPPs 
have been established. This is due to the 
complexity of the permitting process for 
energy projects. GIEPA has nevertheless 
registered many energy project proposals involving the use of renewable. With 
its growing experience in diesel-powered 
and wind power IPPs, NAWEC has developed skills to foster fair relationships with 
IPPs. The practical experience gained could 
accelerate the establishment of many more 
RE projects by IPPs. 
At present, the process of obtaining permits 
for RE projects means dealing with multiple players and institutional barriers. This 
can lead to significant administrative and 
transaction costs. This process needs to be 
simplified to ensure that project developers are not discouraged. Under the RE law, 
the MOE task will be to streamline permitting by simplifying the process and providing clear guidelines for land and water use 
among others. In addition, to stimulate 
private sector interest in the renewables 
sector, there is a need to develop a grid 
code with a favourable set of clauses for 
RE systems. Elements of a grid code are 
already emerging in the draft FITs and 
standard PPA which includes clauses for 
mandatory priority dispatch for renewable electricity as well as grid connection/
access agreements. The grid code should 
consider near time or real time scheduling 
instead of the widely applied day-ahead 
forecast in order to meet the intermittency 
criteria of RE resources. 
Capacity building for successfully concluding PPA negotiations and managing potential conflicts of interest in the future is also 
critical in project finance training. Guidance 
is necessary on international best practice 
in procurement, particularly in managing IPP and PPA negotiations. This needs 
to include the importance of managing 
potential conflicts of interest and ensuring appropriate separation from potential 
bidders.
Quality control and 
standard setting 
In addition of being the regulatory body, 
PURA is also in charge of conducting 
inspection and site visits to all power 
plants and network facilities. This is to 
inspect quality of service delivery and 
monitor health and safety standards. There 
are currently no RE technology standards 
in The Gambia. However, the draft FIT and 
PPA mention general applicable codes and 
standards that the RE plant should comply 
with. It would be worth creating specific 
standards and codes for RE technologies 
to ensure adequate quality, design, safety, 
operation and maintenance of equipment. 
GREC could take up this task and therefore 
its capacities should be built to facilitate the 
development of RE standards and certification of equipment as required. International 
cooperation could be facilitated by IRENA
in this segment. PURA will have to build its 
capacity of relevant personnel in order to 
ensure it can make adequate performance 
appraisals of RE plants, as required in the 
RE law.Box 1
Power Up Gambia 
THE SULEIMAN JUNKUNG GENERAL HOSPITAL located in the town of Bwiam sees over 
20 000 patients every year and has a catchment area of over 100 000 inhabitants. Since 2006, 
the hospital has relied on three diesel generators, which it could only afford to run for 8-10 hours 
a day depending on fuel availability. They saved most of these hours for after dark because the 
staff and patients desperately needed the lights. The remaining 1-3 hours of electricity were 
used during the day, when the hospital was busiest. Without constant electricity, the hospital 
could not safely store medication or provide oxygen and incubators for infants as well as 
running the water pump. Hospital services grew considerably as did the electricity demand. 
The hospital CEO and a non-profit called Power Up Gambia (PUG) raised USD 300 000 for the 
installation of a solar system to meet the hospital needs in a sustainable and cost effective way. 
GAM-Solar, the leading solar panel contractor in The Gambia, assessed the power requirements 
of the hospital. It concluded that 108 solar panels were required to provide the hospital with 
power, 90 for electricity and 18 for running water. In 2009, six PV tracking units with an 
installed capacity of 12 kWp were installed and have been powering the hospital ever since. 
Over the past four years the hospital learned a lot about the opportunities and challenges 
of managing an off-grid solar system, especially issues related to electricity storage. While 
expanding the programme to other rural hospitals and clinics, PUG intends to connect 
the Suleiman Junkung General Hospital to the national grid. This was extended to the town 
of Bwiam in early 2013. It has a net meter arrangement with the utility to send excess solar 
power to the grid and draw it back at night. Net metering would save battery power 
for emergencies and load shedding, reduce wear on the batteries, lower the hospital’s 
electricity cost and increase renewable power production to the grid. PUG intends to work 
on the business model, test it out and replicate it in other rural clinics with access to a grid.

One of the major barriers to attracting investment is RE project developer 
access to the required information for 
robust project proposals. The Gamwind 
and GEF-UNIDO pilot project developers 
have acquired considerable experience. 
Workshops and seminar training on these 
projects would provide practical foundations for future projects.
Given that The Gambia is changing its 
energy landscape, a communication strategy must be developed. It should involve 
key stakeholders, namely GIEPA, PURA, 
NAWEC, MOE and REAGAM. GIEPA and 
PURA should take the lead in communicating timely, detailed and commercially-relevant information to ensure the investment 
market is fully informed of opportunities 
within the country.
Off-grid renewable 
energy options
The government of The Gambia places 
a high premium on providing its citizens 
access to electricity. With a less than 
35% electrification rate at present and 
increasing demand for power for social 
and economic development, broadening 
energy access is an important policy. Grid 
extension has been traditionally associated 
with electrification options in The Gambia. 
However, there are limits to what can be 
achieved through the grid alone, especially in areas of highly dispersed populations, small loads and low load densities. 
Extending transmission lines to these areas 
will be financially prohibitive. Connection 
fees often approaching USD 1000 per 
household may be beyond the reach of 
most people in a country where about 48% 
are currently living on under USD 1.25/day. 
Clearly, an integrated approach as well as an 
understanding of the limits to conventional 
grid extension will be required to balance 
needs, population distribution, costs and 
resources. Some small-scale RE technologies are commercially maturing, such as 
PV, wind energy and biomass, and new and 
innovative service delivery mechanisms are 
surfacing. This means off-grid electrification has emerged as a viable alternative 
for electricity access, especially in areas 
too remote from the grid. The Gambian 
leadership has long recognised the need 
for a dual approach to energy provision. 
This includes expanding both on-grid and 
off-grid systems to accelerate access to 
modernised and clean energy services. 
There is plenty of experience of off-grid PV 
electrification, water pumping and solar 
heating systems for hotels, clinics and 
households. Each of these will be explored 
below.
Off-grid PV electricity
The main decentralised RE system being 
promoted on The Gambian market for 
electricity is solar PV. It has been extensively used since the early 1980s for rural 
water supply and remote power for telecommunication facilities. About ten retail 
companies are active in The Gambia in PV 
for rural applications, and in 2004-2010 
these companies installed a total cumulative capacity of 567.53 kW (table 7).
There is considerable potential for deploying solar home systems in The Gambia. The 
successful implementation of solar PV water 
pumping, solar home systems and PV-diesel 
hybrid projects in Darsilami, sponsored by 
the EU, is a case in point. With a population of 3 000 inhabitants, Darsilami is not 
connected to the grid and is at about 10 km 
from the grid line. The cost of establishing 
transmission lines at USD 90-100 000/km was seen as too costly. Generation capacity 
in The Gambia would not be sufficient to 
meet the energy demands for small towns 
such as Darsilami. The project consists of 
3 000 watt peak (Wp) PV, a 300 Ah battery 
and 9kW diesel components that supply 
continuous power to the Darsilami health 
centre. This is equipped with a vaccine 
refrigerator and small lab with medical 
devices for blood analysis and sterilisation. 
The diesel generator is used only during the 
rainy season and contributes less than 5% 
of the total energy mix. Other load includes 
water pumping, battery charger and electricity supply for public service providers. 
The hybrid system allows upgrades to 15 
kW to bring electricity to 300 households, 
with a daily consumption of 200 KWh per 
household and with a total daily primary 
load of 60 kWh (Geipel, 2009).
Other community-based initiatives include 
the Solar Street Light Project. This resolves 
non-payment of street lighting bills by 
municipal councils and improves the 
NAWEC budget position while maintaining 
the security provided by street lights. This 
project’s progress is detailed in text box 2. 
The success of the Street Light Project led 
to further feasibility studies. These examined potential programmes for solar home 
systems in rural households and other PV

Solar PV and diesel systems should be 
compared on the basis of life cycle costs 
of providing the final service in order to 
account for the major operational differences between these systems. The four 
broad components of life cycle costs are 
initial costs, replacement costs, O&M costs 
and running costs (including fuel use). Two 
observations can be made from the life 
cycle cost comparison between two 3.2 kW 
PV systems and a diesel generator. This is 
used to meet the daily load of 11.5 kWh of a 
rural community (figure 10)7. 
Firstly, over a 20 year project life, the PV 
systems are significantly cheaper, with 
levelised costs of USD 0.29/kWh and 
USD 0.36/kWh, and the payback period is 
five years. In contrast, the diesel system is 
costlier over the longer term with a levelised cost of USD 0.53/kWh. Secondly, the 
85% share of fuel cost for the diesel system 
and a share of capital cost of about 80% for 
the PV systems. Clearly, this has implications for rural households and communities 
in The Gambia who do not have disposable 
incomes to cover high upfront PV costs or 
cannot access adequate bank support. This 
will mean developing sound government 
policies, testing new business models and 
the introducing finance schemes designed 
to support off-grid renewable systems. The 
role of the new RE law and associated regulatory and financial instruments will be critical in creating a viable market supported 
by a sustainable financing mechanism. 
One measure that PV systems have penetrated The Gambian market is the increasing numbers of shops in Banjul and the 
Greater Banjul areas that trade PV solar 
accessories and various system components. Solar panels in these shops range 
in size from 20-235 Wp, and controllers as 
well as efficient appliances can be readily 
obtained. This is a positive development 
in that PV systems are entering the mainstream market and having greater visibility. However, the unregulated nature of the 
market is letting in unlabelled equipment 
with no specifications. The government has 
passed The Gambia Competition Act and is 
expected to pass the Consumer Protection 
Act. These need to be given sufficient

USD 23 520); battery size = 1800 Ah (7 Deka Gel batteries at USD 700/unit) and replace every 7 years; 
inverter cost = USD 0.11/Wp and replace every 10 years; annual O&M cost = USD 20/kW (for 1.25 MW plant size) 
and USD 30/kW (for 100 kW plant); project time = 20 years; inflation = 5%; discount rate =12%.

Off-grid PV water pumping
Since 1990, steady progress in extending rural water coverage was made in 
The Gambia, and it was reported in 2010 
that 80% of the country has now access 
to water. This would be sufficient to meet 
the Millennium Development Goal by 2015 
(AMCOW, 2010). Access to an improved 
water source refers to the percentage of the 
population with least 20 litres per person/
day within one km of the dwelling from an 
improved source. This could be a household connection, public standpipe, borehole, protected well and rainwater collector. In The Gambia, groundwater sources 
meet most of the potable water needs, 
hence energy use for pumping water is a 
critical input for water access. Handpumps, 
diesel generators, PV systems and some 
wind pumps are in use at present.
Ongoing and upcoming projects in The 
Gambia will improve access to rural water 
services. The Gambian government has 
recently initiated a large-scale Rural Water 
Supply Project, with the USD 4 875m from 
the Islamic Development Bank (IDB). This 
will provide 90 drilled wells with hand 
pumps and ten systems with a borehole, 
tank and pipe distribution network to ten 
communities. The government recently

The project will provide 18 new solar-powered drilled boreholes and pumping units 
and elevated water tanks and distribution 
networks with public stand-taps. It will 
rehabilitate and upgrade four water supply 
facilities, provide sanitation in schools, rural 
health centres and markets. With funding 
from various development partners, a local 
solar firm, GAM-Solar, has installed smaller 
scale solar pumping systems in about 80 
villages. They serve more than 200 000 
villagers.
The source of the energy used is critical to 
the overall cost of water pumping systems. 
As PV prices are falling and the volatility of 
the fossil fuel market increases globally, PV 
pumps are rapidly becoming more attractive than the traditional pumps powered by 
diesel and gasoline.
In a life cycle cost analysis using countryspecific data conducted for The Gambia 
it is shown that over the longer term, PV 
performs better than diesel (figure 11). It 
provides a more reliable alternative for a 
continuous water supply. This illustrates 
how emerging price trends and technology development favours PV over diesel. 
This is likely to continue into the future.
The need to provide water services is not 
limited to the household sector, but also 
extends to commercial and productive 
sectors. As The Gambia pushes to enhance 
its agricultural sector to improve food security as well as diversify its trade, the need 
for improved irrigation will assume greater 
importance. Affordable and reliable energy 
for pumping water for irrigation could play 
a central role in enabling smallholders to 
extend their production into the longer 
dry season. This would improve their earnings, transforming rural economies and

Gambia’s development plans as detailed 
in PAGE 2012-15. GAM-Solar has installed 
several agricultural solar irrigation systems 
funded by donor organisations and NGOs, 
such as the recent eight hectare drip-line 
irrigation project at Sifoe Farm.
Solar water heating
Water heating is a major consumer of 
energy in The Gambia – mainly in hotels, 
clinics and some households. Significant 
savings can be made if hotels and other 
large institutions are able to capitalise on 
the energy savings opportunities from 
solar water heating systems, which have 
been around for several decades. The 
technology is mature, simple to repair and 
replicate, and heats water cost-effectively. 
Conclusions were drawn as early as the 
1980s that major hot water users could 
make significant financial savings by 
switching from diesel-powered and electric water heating systems to solar heating 
systems. The most common type of solar 
water heater in The Gambia incorporates a 
2m2 flat-plate solar collector and a 300 litre 
storage tank, and has a payback period of 
less than one year. 
Some hotels have already invested in solar 
water heating systems, due to increasing 
awareness of ecotourism practices and 
motivated by the high cost of electricity. 
Kombo Beach Hotel has installed a 6 000 
litre solar water and hot water storage 
system. It is backed up by a thermal heating system using fuel oil in the event of a 
hot water shortfall from the solar system. 
However, the high initial investment cost 
has remained an obstacle for most hotels, 
although increasing numbers of smaller 
hotels located away from the grid are 
investing in solar heating systems. 
Based on these experiences, the viability of solar water heaters in the resource 
and economic context of The Gambia 
is convincing. For a typical load like the 
Kombo Beach Hotel and a capital cost of 
about USD 15 000, the solar water heater 
could have a payback period of under 2.5 
years. This is for a system with a lifetime 
service of 20 years (figure 11). 
Continuing to rely on grid electricity would 
mean that water heating services are 
subject to higher costs and less reliable 
service delivery due to load shedding and 
other technical problems. Since one of the 
grid challenges is inadequate generation 
capacity, shifting the water heating load to 
solar means grid electricity could be freed 
up for other end-uses. It could release 
pent-up demand in various sectors. 
Since 2000, considerable experience has 
been obtained and skills developed in solar 
heating systems in The Gambia. In 2004, 
the Ministry of Energy (MOE) developed a 
solar water heater using a converted electric water heater tank in collaboration with 
GTTI. This is significant because it means 
two types of solar water heating are available to households. They have a market 
price of about USD 400 for the flat white 
bed type and USD 630-2600 for the more 
expensive vacuum type. 
While this has been a productive DoE/GTTI
collaboration, it could have benefitted from 
a strong national promotion programme. 
This would have mainstreamed the technology to a wider end-user base beyond a 
few private initiatives. 
Looking ahead, design regulations with 
a specific mandate for different sectors 
(industrial, tourism and households) to 
install solar water heaters would help the 
technology gain further traction.RRA findings
The RRA has demonstrated that off-grid 
renewable systems have already made 
a significant contribution to social and 
economic development in The Gambia. It 
is also important to note that decentralised RE development in The Gambia will 
not be a ‘silver bullet’ for universal access. 
It will, however, probably be an important 
component of any expansion in electricity access. The following are some specific 
findings from the RRA relevant to off-grid 
electrification. 
Importance of clear rural
electrification strategy
In The Gambia, as in most countries in the 
region, rural electrification campaigns were 
conducted using grid-based technologies. 
This is understandable since grid-based 
technologies enable lower cost connections 
to those closer to the grid. The challenge 
with a grid-based approach is that it will 
not reach remote or dispersed communities. It may even cause people to go to the 
grid rather than the grid come to them. The 
high electricity access in the Greater Banjul 
area when compared to the very low rates 
of access in other areas, points to this reality. Although the recent NAWEC electrification experience is encouraging, there is still 
a need for a clear rural electrification strategy. Despite electricity demand growth in 
the provincial centres, generation fell due 
to high operation and maintenance costs. 
This resulted in shorter electricity supply. 
Part of the challenge is that consumer 
tariffs in the provincial areas do not reflect 
costs (they are heavily subsidised). This 
has contributed to the NAWEC overall low 
financial strength and credibility.
A robust rural electrification strategy 
would be aligned with local (provincial) 
development plans. This would result in a 
more coordinated and effective approach 
in meeting the electricity needs of the rural 
population. The strategy should define 
short, medium and long-term access 
targets supported by technology specific 
targets within defined geographic areas for 
off-grid electrification. One way would be 
to introduce rural energy service concessions. This would allow an entity (private 
Figure 12 
Solar heater cumulative cash flow and payback periodsector, NGO, community organisation etc.) 
to exclusively serve one or more defined 
areas under a concessionary agreement. 
The resource assessment carried out 
shows that provincial areas have adequate 
radiation all year round to enable renewables to play a significant role in off-grid 
electrification. 
Alignment of RE bill with IPP needs
The draft RE law under discussion supports 
the establishment of off-grid RE/hybrid 
facilities run by IPPs. For systems up to 
200 kW, the IPP would be allowed to 
charge electricity tariffs to consumers up 
to the national retail tariff. An IPP wishing to operate a larger system or charge 
electricity tariffs above the national retail 
tariffs would need to negotiate the terms 
with the regulator. The RE fund, which will 
be administered by PURA, would provide 
financial incentives such as capital subsidies, production-based subsidies and equity 
participation. These would be available for 
mini-grid and off-grid renewable power 
systems for remote areas and islands. This 
should attract private sector investment in 
the sector. The expected challenge would 
be to ensure that the RE Fund will have 
sufficient resources to maintain the investment momentum. The government will 
need to employ a variety of creative fundraising mechanisms to sustain the fund. 
Economic assessment
of hybridisation
There is plenty of experience of a variety 
of technologies in The Gambia. It is important to document and assess the cost of 
single and combination (hybrid) technologies in the different regions. This produces 
dynamic data on the range of technologies and their performance under different conditions. The diesel-based mini-grid 
operated by NAWEC offers a compelling 
case for its hybridisation with RE sources. 
Since solar radiation is abundant throughout the country, detailed feasibility data 
on hybridizing the diesel mini-grids with 
solar PV would help to demonstrate the 
economics of these systems to potential 
investors.
Standards and labels
(accreditation and certification)
The lack of accreditation and certification 
of RE technologies restricts the promotion 
of PV-based electrification and solar water 
heating. Most companies currently operating in The Gambia have a long and solid 
track record in delivering high standard 
projects. It is anticipated that the renewables market will expand and that possibly 
new entrants into the trading and system 
installation market will emerge. It is important to establish standards and labels for 
renewables equipment (whether imported 
or locally manufactured) and ensure their 
proper installation and operation. It is not 
clear who would oversee this important 
task. 
GREC capacity development
The role of GREC will need to be redefined 
and its capacity developed further. As a 
knowledge hub of the MOE, GREC could 
play a pivotal role in maintaining high standards of research and development activities. It could use its own human resources 
and work with NGOs, the private sector and 
tertiary education institutions. However, 
funding for the continuous support of R&D 
in the RE sector has been discontinued. 
Adequate staffing was not maintained. This 
means GREC consists of only one full-time 
technician with an office at the REAGAM
facilities plus some administrative support. 
As matters stand, GREC does not have a 
qualified expert that could fulfil its origi-nal mandate of RE R&D and the provision 
of sound technical support to the MOE. 
The Gambia should therefore support the 
revival of GREC by entrusting the centre 
with a number of roles. 
These include scientific, technological and 
innovative research in RE, promoting RE for 
industrial uses and building the capacity of 
installers of RE systems with proper certification. This was outlined in the RE bill. In 
order to attract qualified expertise for this 
purpose, the government of The Gambia 
will need to allocate a specific budget 
from internal sources. It will also need to 
support partnerships between GREC and 
well-established international centres with 
a similar mandate. 
Availability of soft loan schemes
or other credit lines for solar PV
The upfront cost of RE systems is a disadvantage to rural communities with little 
income from obtaining electricity services. 
The rural energy system as it has evolved 
to date is complex and not disposed to 
adequate planning and resource coordination. Soft loans can be attractive. A small 
down payment of the total price is made 
and the rest paid over a number of years at 
a preferential interest rate. 
In The Gambian context where bank loans 
come with an 18% interest rate, a grant 
from a multilateral agency or donor could 
be ring-fenced. This would get soft loan 
schemes up and running for household or 
community electrification purposes. 
While this cannot be considered as a longterm funding solution, it could address 
energy for social development needs and 
may also serve to stimulate the renewables 
market in rural areas. The RE fund will be 
instrumental in providing finance to kick 
start subsidies and loan schemes.
General capacity development
The Gambia has built a credible human 
capacity in some renewable applications 
such as PV and water heating systems. 
However, as yet, there are no government 
or NGO-led public education programmes, 
no RE industry associations and no formalised RE technical training programmes. 
Capacity development for planning and 
implementing large-scale off-grid (and 
on-grid) programmes will need to be 
increased if the promise of RE resources is 
to be fully realised. Private sector involvement will require multiple skills in energy 
analysis, engineering, finance and management in order to build a strong RE business 
environment.
Biomass for 
cooking and heating
A range of solid biomass resources are used 
in The Gambia, consisting of fuelwood, 
charcoal, agricultural residues and industrial wastes of agricultural origin. In the 
Greater Banjul area, much of the fuelwood 
and charcoal is imported from Guinea and 
southern Senegal. In rural Gambia, fuel is 
mainly gathered from community woodlands or shrubs near the villages. Officially, 
charcoal production has been banned by a 
presidential decree since 1977, but although 
the law is well articulated, compliance is 
low. Charcoal continues to be produced in 
several villages in the West coast region 
through often obsolete and inefficient 
production methods. 
Amid growing concerns for sustainable 
supply of energy services to the household sector, a Household Energy Strategy 
(HES) was devised for the energy sector. 
It had the support of Comité Inter etats 
de Lutte contre la Secheresse au SahelInterstate Committee for Drought Control 
in Sahel (lCILSS)/PREDAS (Regional Programme for the Promotion of Domestic 
and Alternative Energies in the Sahel) and 
was approved by the cabinet in 2006. It 
was the outcome of four sector studies 
undertaken in 2004. These focused on 
household energy consumption, charcoal, 
charcoal briquetting from agro-industrial 
residues and community-based natural 
resource management. 
Based on the HES recommendations in 
2006, the MOE has outlined specific action 
points, including increased efficiency in 
the production and utilisation of forest 
resources. These are as follows:
w	Promotion and development of 
improved cookstoves. In 2007, the 
MOE supported the local production, testing and dissemination of the 
JIKO improved charcoal stove through 
GREC. It was locally called Furno 
Jambar. Prior to this period, other 
improved cookstoves were promoted, 
including the metal ring for firewood. 
Local production of the Furno Jambar 
in The Gambia started after 2007.
w	Construction of a bulk storage facility for LPG. The HES recommended an 
increased use in alternatives to fuelwood given concerns about woody 
ecosystem degradation. LPG was 
identified as one of the alternatives. In 
2009, a new bulk storage facility for 
petroleum products of 51 000 tonnes 
was commissioned including 1000mt 
for LPG. Prior to this period, all LPG 
into the country was imported mainly 
from Senegal using truck tankers. The 
construction of bulk storage for LPG 
increased the security and reliability of

Production and promotion of groundnut 
shell briquetting for cooking and heating 
GreenTech is a private company established in early 2011 with the aim of improving 
the cooking fuel supply chain. The company produces and supplies high quality fuel 
briquettes from groundnut shell residues. It also researches, designs and markets 
fuel-efficient stoves, allowing end-users to save time, money and natural resources. 
GreenTech has a briquette production capacity of 800 kg/hr and supports the 
production of fuel-efficient stoves made from recycled metal by local welders. 
GreenTech's innovative stoves also emit less smoke than the traditional firewood 
alternative. These are especially beneficial to women and children, who are most 
involved in the cooking process. Fuel switching from charcoal in an open stove to 
briquettes in fuel-efficient stoves can save a family 60% of their cooking fuel cost. 
The briquettes can also be used in restaurants, canteens or industries using heat 
from biomass for boilers or smokeries. Nevertheless, GreenTech realised that a lot of 
effort is still needed to sensitise and convince potential users of their environmental 
and economic advantages. The company received the SEED Award in 2011 and 
has since been approached by several institutions to present and demonstrate the 
products, service and concepts at national and international level. This has allowed 
the company to become a knowledge hub for biomass briquettes to establish 
decentralised, independent sales points.
For more information visit: www.greentechgambia.comsupply, but the high retail price for LPG 
remains an obstacle. 
w	Production of groundnut shell 
briquettes. Groundnuts are The 
Gambia’s principal agricultural export 
crop. In the 1980s, the Groundnut Shell 
Briquette Project was initiated and 
a plant commissioned. It converted 
groundnut shells into fuel briquettes 
with a capacity of six tonnes of 
briquettes per hour as part of a household energy solution. However, the plant 
was not extensively used and the project failed due to household resistance 
to change. This was due to excessive 
smoke, stoves unsuited to briquettes, 
the absence of a widespread, intensive 
marketing strategy, and the relatively 
high cost of briquettes compared to 
wood and charcoal (DMCI, 2005). 
However, most of these problems could 
have been solved with commitment 
and a marketing and awareness-raising strategy about the advantages of 
briquettes. These include lower energy 
cost per calorie of heat provided. In 
2009, the MOE, the Department of 
Forestry and GreenTech Company 
initiated the re-establishment of a 
groundnut shell briquetting plant with 
the intention of solving these problems 
(box 3).
RRA findings
During the RRA, discussion focused mainly 
on improved cookstoves and forest/agriculture waste-based alternative fuels. A
number of problems were identified that 
are specific to the biomass sector. They 
include: 
i) the absence of a clearly defined policy 
on the use of biomass, including waste 
biomass and energy crops for various 
energy applications 
ii) lack of institutional coordination and 
collaboration among stakeholders and 
with financial institutions 
iii) absence of efficient cookstove standards as well as inadequate awareness-building campaigns to encourage 
behavioural change in energy usage. 
Some specific areas of intervention 
were identified during the RRA.
Role of the RENEWABLE
ENERGY law
The MOE is mandated to carry out an 
impact assessment for the use of biomass 
for electricity and other energy purposes 
(heating, cooling and transport fuel). This 
is to take place within one year of the RE
Act coming into force in 2013. The assessment is to include among other things:
w The most appropriate use for waste 
biomass in relation to cooking fuel.
w Forestry and agricultural impacts of 
using different biomass energy sources 
for cooking/heating. 
w The feasibility and economic impacts 
of using different biomass energy 
sources.
This assessment should mean a strategy 
for the sustainable use of biomass energy 
is drafted and adopted. The biomass strategy would ensure the sustainable supply of 
biomass-based cooking fuel and promote 
the use of alternative fuel as well as efficient cooking equipment/devices. 
Develop/update master plan
for fuelwood supply
The stakeholders felt that the strategy 
should lead to the development/update 
of a master plan for fuelwood supply. This should reinforce the current forest 
management plans and identify optimal 
ways to access/produce alternative fuels 
at affordable prices. It was also suggested 
that the strategy should have three main 
components: 
i) promotion of improved cookstoves 
produced locally; 
ii) promotion of biomass-based alternative fuel; and 
iii) stronger sustainable production of 
fuelwood through community-based 
wood lot management.
The need for public
awareness-raising
The sector is informally organised, and this 
is one of the major barriers preventing the 
rollout of improved cookstoves. It lacks 
adequate communication, sensitisation 
campaigns and advocacy. Some surveys 
have highlighted that the reluctance of 
households to use improved cookstoves is 
not only due to their cost. Other reasons 
are a lack of financial management and 
planning skills and different household 
spending priorities. Yet even when the life 
cycle cost of different stoves is assessed, 
briquettes stoves are more cost-effective 
than traditional stoves (GreenTech).
Technology barriers
The current stoves need further improvement for meeting users’ requirements in 
terms of cooking time. Women complain 
that cooking with the improved stoves 
takes longer compared to open fire stoves. 
GREC could be designated as technical 
centre for working with users in designing 
and testing improved cookstoves to bring 
them in line with their design expectations. GREC technical capacity should be 
built and adapted to the technical challenges faced by The Gambia. End-user 
need to know more about energy, technolSource: Ministry of Energy, The Gambiaogy and finance to enable them to adopt 
new technologies and use existing ones 
properly. This minimises the burden of high 
fuel cost and reduces time spent collecting 
fuelwood. Public communication or local 
community training could be provided 
through outreach workers. 
Financing mechanisms
are critical
Mainstreaming improved cookstoves is 
fraught with challenges. Many failed examples testify to this reality. In countries where 
cookstove promotion had succeeded, there 
was strong collaboration between policy 
makers, the private sector and financial 
institutions to provide structure and coherence in the sector. The stakeholder mix 
should also include finance organisations 
such as microcredit institutions. These 
would be in a position to provide finance 
to serve low income groups. Existing wood 
retailers can also be used for marketing/
communicating these technologies as they 
work within a strong national network. 
Opportunities and 
constraints for 
scaling up renewable 
energy deployment
Alignment of energy 
policies with broader
development priorities
The Gambia is pushing through a series of 
energy and development programmes to 
improve social and economic development. 
Its PAGE has the aim of accelerating propoor growth and generating employment. 
The programme also reserves ample space 
and attention to the development of the 
national infrastructure, including energy, as 
a way to meet these goals. On the energy 
front, The Gambia is now preparing a 
robust RE law. 
This aims to expand RE through a variety of 
delivery mechanisms and business models. 
Introducing these policies is not easy in a 
country heavily reliant on fossil fuel, with 
growing demand for electricity and a weak 
transmission and distribution infrastructure. The Gambia is also taking a strong 
position in its energy policy and strategy to 
ensure the private sector plays an important role in developing the power sector. To 
realise this goal, The Gambia is preparing a 
series of regulatory instruments such as a 
FIT and bankable PPAs to meet RE sector 
requirements. 
WAPP effect
West African regional power development work is progressing with a number 
of transmission and rehabilitation projects 
already completed. It is expected that The 
Gambia will benefit from importing more 
power than it will produce domestically. 
Furthermore, RE technologies are likely 
to play a major role in developing an integrated power pool. This is because their 
share in the region could amount to as 
much as 52% in 2030 if the cost of these 
technologies continues to fall and fossil fuel 
prices continue to rise (IRENA, 2013b). 
For smaller countries like The Gambia, 
this could mean a reduction in the 
long-term marginal cost of power by 
USD 0.02–0.07/kWh (Eberhard et al. 2011). 
WAPP could usher in an era of cheaper 
and more secure power supply. This should 
be welcome, but cross-border power 
transmission will still require considerable 
investment, a high degree of collective 
ownership and a new terrain of engagement which has little precedent in Africa. 
The effect of a highly interconnected power 
infrastructure on rural energy services in 
The Gambia is uncertain, as most people 
will continue to rely on decentralised systems. There are clear opportunities for 
The Gambia. However, it is important to 
carry out a further assessment that considers the real implications of this for the 
whole range of energy users. 
importanCE OF LeadershiP
Policy makers across Africa have been 
among the last to embrace RE as a solution to their energy problems. They are 
often locked into crisis management on 
a day-to-day basis. The country’s policy 
makers need to be persuaded that RE
has a real future in the energy mix of The 
Gambia. They need to demonstrate this 
by their actions. The Gambia has already 
started this process by setting up a strong 
policy that includes RE as part of its energy 
future. It is in the process of building the 
institutional and legal framework that will 
help to deliver this promise. 
The success of the RE mission will be 
judged by what transpires on the ground in 
generating tangible results, improving livelihoods and creating stability in the energy 
system. 
The role of the public sector then becomes 
critical in balancing the wider mediumterm needs of society and country with 
short-term measures sufficiently attractive 
to the private sector. This means building investor confidence by simplifying the 
business environment in which investment 
can flourish, and having clear and transparent governance. 
One practical step would be to set out 
clear mechanisms for calculating the PPA
tariff for renewables. This gives potential 
investors sufficient confidence to plan and 
finance projects with a full view of future 
revenues. Future investment only occurs if 
there is sufficient confidence that investors 
today are gaining good returns. 
The Gambia has an attractive investment 
environment in tourism and other development sectors. It needs to broaden this to 
the energy sector. That means building its 
own capacity to implement its policies to 
promote and support RE. The right conditions need to be created to enable local 
manufacturing and/or assembly of renewable technologies. 
Energy efficiency as a resource
Limiting energy losses along the power 
system chain, i.e., from generation to 
end-use, is critical. This should form part 
of The Gambia’s future energy strategy. 
High transmission and distribution losses 
(over 30% in The Gambia) worsen the 
energy security problem. They also deepen 
suppressed demand. Those with the ability 
to pay will turn to on-site generators. All 
these have economic, social and environmental costs. 
The significance of energy efficiency is 
highlighted in The Gambia’s 2005 Energy 
Policy. However, the country’s struggle 
with generation and transmission has sidelined the tangible gains from demand-side 
measures. Investment in end-use energy 
efficiency (whether through technology intervention or awareness-raising) 
increases the availability of system-wide 
electricity generation and transmission 
capacity for other uses. 
In other words, end-use efficiency can be 
considered a resource. It could provide 
energy savings comparable to the electricity generated by power plants. Due to 
the high capital cost of RE technologies, 
there are benefits in making demandside efficiency improvements. They yield 
a greater impact per unit of investment in 
renewables. A sustainable energy economy 
thus requires major commitments to both 
energy efficiency and RE development. Capitalise on off-grid 
opportunities, build knowledge
systems and plan ahead 
Off-grid energy systems can play a significant role in electrification programmes in 
rural areas. However, more work is needed 
to ensure that prices are competitive and 
affordable. The range of pro-poor financing 
mechanisms needs to be tested and evaluated with this aim. It is therefore important 
to produce an inventory of experiences 
specific to The Gambia in terms of the 
range of delivery mechanisms and business models. 
It is also important to assess whether 
the new regulatory and legal frameworks 
will act as enablers or obstacles to mainstreaming off-grid RE into the energy 
mix. This process of energy knowledge 
generation could help develop a dynamic 
techno-economic assessment framework 
for off-grid system design. This would 
take material sourcing, installation cost, 
available energy resources, energy storage options, robustness of design and 
social acceptance into consideration. 
It would help The Gambia develop its 
off-grid energy strategy through informed 
and tailored technical and business models 
compatible with local resources, institutions and economic factors. It would also 
be useful for private sector players as it 
would provide them with updated information about various technologies in the 
context of The Gambia. This role could be 
taken up by GREC.
High cost of debt
For any given project, financial institutions 
will assess both the risks and returns of 
the project. Each individual risk is analysed and studied in terms of managing its 
potential impact on the project. Different 
risk categories include country risk, market 
risk, business risk, interest rate risk, project 
risk and foreign exchange risk. The Gambia 
provides a mixed picture when viewed 
against these risk categories. However, its 
banking system has been characterised by high interest rates for some time. This 
is the fiscal policy for limiting inflation rate 
increases and maintaining stability in the 
national currency. At present, the bank loan 
interest rate stands at 18%. This will have an 
impact on the evolution of the RE market 
and the types of market players likely to 
play a defining role. 
Numerous studies show that high interest 
rates and relatively short loans add significant amounts to the cost of RE investment. This situation places The Gambia in 
a difficult position. Even if the cost of debt 
servicing falls, access to low cost equity 
and limits on foreign exchange are likely to 
present additional medium-term barriers 
to growth in the RE sector. 
There are a few paths The Gambia can 
pursue independently or in collaboration 
with other partners. The Gambia should 
strengthen its effort to bring to bear international funds as a means of providing soft 
loans with generous repayment terms, low 
interest rates and flexible timeframes. 
This can be ring-fenced as a resource 
that is exclusively used to boost capacity, increase technology visibility, develop 
robust institutions and build experience in 
RE applications. The Gambia could involve 
its national development bank to finance 
RE projects with low cost and longer term 
financing. A programme of this kind would 
need to be seen as an important national 
development strategy. 
The Gambia could continue to encourage 
external investors by offering an attractive investment environment such as tax 
holidays and waivers on import tariffs 
for components. These investors would, 
however, expect to set their own prices and 
would be inclined to make rapid returns on 
their investment, and this presents another 
challenge. Moreover, international players who have invested equity in the sector 
would expect to cash in their returns in 
scarce foreign currency while they sell electricity in The Gambian Dalasi internally. 
The value of this longer term engagement 
is that energy would be treated as a means 
to achieving broader development objectives. The availability of reliable electricity 
supplies would translate into wider socioeconomic gains. 
The RRA identified a large number of 
issues with decisive implications for the 
effective deployment of RE resources in 
The Gambia. Some of these are specific to 
the five priority resource-service pairs for 
scaling up renewable deployment in the 
short- to medium-term. However, some are 
generic in nature. Section 5 summarises 
the key actions identified by the RRA.Source: Ministry of Energy, The GambiaV. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
The following table identifies seven recommended action points revealed by the RRA. They 
all apply to priority resource-service pairs. This action is not presented in any order of priority, and this rapid assessment is unlikely to produce an exhaustive list of measures needed. 
The detailed list of action can be found in annex I.

 OF RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
The RRA process identified and recommended the action below. It is not given in 
any order of priority, and the list of action points from a rapid assessment is unlikely 
to be exhaustive. This action could improve the Gambia’s readiness to scale up its 
renewables deployment. It is designed to be taken in the short- to medium-term, 
largely through decisions made by the government of The Gambia.
Action 1: Speed up renewable energy law
Action Speed up RE law
Resource-service pair(s) Centralised and decentralised grid electricity, all RE resources
Description The RE bill preparation funded by the EU Energy Initiative has 
just been completed and validated. Bill enactment will be initiated and followed up by MOE, the line ministry responsible. 
As with all other bills, this may not require extra funding 
beyond the normal budgetary allocation of the implementing 
agency, MOE.
 MOE is to be responsible for seeking and obtaining written 
concurrence of all stakeholders on the bill’s appropriateness, 
adequacy and suitability for enactment into law. It would then 
present it to cabinet for approval following which it would 
present it to the National Assembly for ratification. Finally, the 
ministry will ensure it is signed into an Act by the president. The 
ministry will ensure all the activities needed to be carried out 
by PURA to effectively implement the Act are duly completed, 
signed by the minister as necessary and published. This may 
require financial expenses beyond the budgetary allocations 
of the ministry. These could be sought from available potential 
donor sources. 
Stakeholders MOE, cabinet, PURA, National Assembly, donors and all other 
stakeholders including REAGAMTiming By end 2013
Keys to success Enactment of the bill will require consensus on the terms of 
the text. Its effectiveness will depend on the extent to which it 
gives incentives for RE. The availability of funds to support its 
promulgation will be crucial and will depend in part on continued engagement with donors.
Action 2: Establish standards and labels for 
 renewable energy equipment
Action Establish standards and labels for RE equipment
Resource-service pair(s) Centralised and decentralised grid electricity, all RE resources
Description The Gambia Bureau of Standards was established in 2010. 
However, there are no established standards and labelling 
requirements that aim to prevent the sale of unsafe and inefficient RE equipment and technologies.
The need for standards in RE equipment and technologies was 
recognised as early as 1982. Solar cook stoves, solar powered 
water and wind pumps were developed, promoted and 
continued to be promoted without any systematic attempt 
to standardise/streamline the technologies. Also, no quality 
control was actively introduced, especially for fuel efficiency, 
to guarantee satisfaction and avoid a negative reputation. 
One cannot over emphasise the need for standards and labels 
for RE equipment as part of a concerted effort to accelerate 
deployment of RE resources and technologies. Only through 
standardisation and labelling is the vendor, manufacturer or 
importer still liable for the safety of the RE equipment where 
testing and/or voluntary approval has not been sought.
Stakeholders MOE, the Gambia Bureau of Standards, NAWEC, PURA, 
REAGAM and potential investors (private companies, utilities 
and commercial banks).
Timing Early 2013
Keys to success Engagement with organisations with similar experience in 
other countries and regions (e.g., Morocco, Egypt)Action 3: Revive GREC
Action Revive GREC
Resource-servicepair(s) Centralised and decentralised grid electricity, all 
RE resources.
Description GREC was established in 1987 as the technical arm of the DoE
in the field of RE and energy efficiency. Its primary function 
was to conduct adaptive research in RE, develop and promote 
the use of RE and energy efficiency technologies and advise 
government on RE and energy efficiency. 
Since its establishment, the centre has organised a series of 
biannual energy shows and exhibitions, assessed and tested 
household energy appliances and carried out training in RE
and energy efficiency appliances. It has also conducted sensitisation and communication campaigns and liaised with energy 
companies. However, due to limited highly-qualified personnel and equipment the centre has become dormant. Reviving 
the centre would thus require staffing it with qualified personnel supported by an RE expert on a technical assistance basis. 
It would also mean appropriately equipping it and allocating 
it an adequate continuous budget. 
Stakeholders MOE, DOE, PURA and MOFEA
Timing 2013
Keys to success Engagement of an RE expert with a good track record in 
research, improved staffing, donor assistance to equip the 
centre and ensure adequate continuous funding.Action 4: Assess, update and validate solar, 
 biomass and wind resource mapping
Action Assess, update and validate solar, biomass and 
wind resource mapping 
Resource-service pair(s) Wind, solar and biomass for all applications.
Description There is at present a broad understanding of resource availability and potential, but this is generally not sufficient to 
enable project development or a comprehensive assessment 
of potential. Similarly, there is some data collection from actual 
projects, but this is not comprehensive or centralised.
Comprehensive data will facilitate the implementation of the 
draft renewable energy strategy and future project development. Particular gaps exist in solar, wind and biomass; benefits could also be gained from an assessment of bioenergy 
potential. Likely action in implementing a mapping process 
could include:
- engage with existing initiatives for data collection, 
including observatory currently being established by 
 ECREEE
- identify precise requirements for resource mapping, 
based on priority are as for RE development
- establish a plan for data collection 
- explore the potential for funding ground measurement 
campaigns with multilateral/bilateral organisations
Stakeholders MOE, NAWEC, ECREEE, project developers, GREC, NARI, 
DWR and donors
Timing Mid-2013 for definition of requirements and protocol, on 
going for data collection
Keys to success Technical and human resources available for data collection, identify and secure funds for data collection, establish a 
protocol for sharing dataAction 5: Establish renewable energy fund 
 and identify funding sources
Action Establish RE fund and identify sources of funding
Resource-service pair(s) Biomass, wind and solar for all applications
Description One of the key objectives of the government’s energy policy 
is to widen the population’s access to modernised forms of 
energy so as to stimulate development and reduce poverty. 
Communities who do not have access to the electricity 
network are one of the main groups with potential to benefit from renewable electricity support. However, community 
investment in the Gambia presents serious challenges. It is 
difficult for communities to access finance and develop the 
skills and knowledge required. Similarly factors like high initial 
costs, high private lending costs, commercial sustainability of 
members of REAGAM and financial and technical performance 
risks have limited the rapid expansion of enterprises. This is 
compounded by the lack of a fully transparent framework for 
private sector investment. 
 Establishing the RE fund providing soft loans, capital subsidies and other financial incentives for renewable generation 
projects as outlined in the draft RE law will thus be an essential. It will drive the acceleration of renewables deployment in 
the short- to medium-term. The government should identify 
specific internal sources of funding and lobby financial and 
development partners to further support the fund. 
Stakeholders MOE, MOFEA, donor community, cabinet, National Assembly 
and IRENA.
Timing Mid-2014
Keys to success Feasibility study to identify internal niches of funding that 
could support the RE fund along with consultation with key 
bilateral and multilateral donor agencies to further support 
the fund. Action 6: Build stakeholder capacity 
 (policy makers, regulator and the private sector)
Action Build stakeholder capacity (policy makers, regulator and the 
private sector)
Resource-service pair(s) Off-grid and on-grid services, wind and solar resources
Description The Gambia appears to have a shortage of relevant skills for 
the power sector. 
 Inadequate technical skills are felt at all levels: engineers, 
mechanics and technicians. Often these skills are recruited 
from outside the country, from the wider ECOWAS region or 
German, Lebanese or French expats. GEG employs around 60 
expats, for example.
The MOE, NAWEC and PURA have also expressed a need for 
more capacity in the power sector. The MOE includes “capacity building for MOE, NAWEC and other stakeholders” as part 
of its draft Strategic Plan 2010-2014. Specific capacity-building programmes are not identified. Management and project 
finance training may be beneficial, particularly for managing 
IPP processes.
Furthermore, capacity building at the management, regulatory and procurement level will be important for MOE, NAWEC 
and PURA, as they lead and manage the transition to a fit-forpurpose power system.
UTG and technical training institutions will play a key role in 
continuously working with government and private sector 
to deliver capacity-building and training activities at several 
levels:
•	 At the academic level with the development of master
programmes and the training of engineers, designers, 
etc.
•	 At the professional level, with their support in the 		
capacity-building activities for professionals 
(installers etc.)
•	 At the grassroots level, by supporting awareness 	 	
campaignsStakeholders MOE, PURA, GREC, NARI, RDI, REAGAM, RE Fund, private 
sector manufacturers and suppliers of equipment, other technical, vocational institutes and the UTG and IRENA
Timing From 2013 
Keys to success Capacity-building activities and training programmes are 
essential to developing a national industry. Establishing 
contact with international agencies and other countries which 
have developed these technologies will be important. This 
will help monitor the development of standards and codes for 
power system installations. 
Action 7: Allocate land for renewable energy use
Action Allocate land for RE use
Resource-service pair (s) Solar, wind and biomass for on-grid/off-grid electricity 
Description Given the small size of the country, developing RE plants will 
mean setting up a robust procedure in consultation with all 
relevant stakeholders to allocate land suitable potential for 
the developing RE power plants. 
Stakeholders MOE, Ministry of Local Government & Lands and its technical 
departments of Community Development, Physical Planning 
and Lands and Surveys, MOFEN, Tourism Development 
Authority (TDA), legal advisor, NARI and NGOs including 
REAGAM.
Timing By end of 2014
Keys to success - Identifying and responding to public concern relating to 
land use allocation and associated conflicts
- Inclusive participation of all stakeholders 
throughout the review
- An understanding of the need for land use policy and 
its implicationsIRENA Secretariat
