NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY 
MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND POWER 
DEVELOPMENT 
Produced by the 
Ministry of Energy and Power Development 
 
ZIM B AB W E
M NI SI TRY OF ENERGY & POWER DEVELOPMENTMINISTERIAL FOREWORD 
Energy plays an invaluable role in social and economic development as it is a 
critical factor of production, its cost impacting directly on other services and the 
competitiveness of enterprises. Every productive sector in the economy relies on 
the provision of energy. It is therefore essential that the policy framework in this 
sector be sensitive to the ever-rising challenges not only in this sector but in the 
economy as a whole. 
The National Energy Policy (NEP) seeks to promote the optimal supply and 
utilisation of energy, for socio-economic development in a safe, sustainable and 
environmentally friendly manner. It is clear that the essence of the NEP’s 
objectives will remain valid even though the social, political, environmental and 
economic situation changes continually. Such changes will necessitate policy 
review, with reference being made to the scenarios prevailing in the entire 
economy and international environment. A consultative process was key to the 
design and development of the NEP to ensure that the views of all stakeholders in 
the country were taken into account. 
The NEP brings out Government’s objective to ensure that the energy sector’s 
potential to drive economic growth and reduce poverty is fully harnessed. The 
policy therefore provides a guide to decision-makers, policy-makers and 
development managers in Government, the private sector, Non-Governmental 
Organisations and civil society, on Government’s intended actions in the energy 
sector. 
Owing to supply constraints, our current (2012) consumption levels are suppressed 
and below levels achieved in the 1990s. It would therefore be misleading for 
demand forecasts to be based on an extrapolation of historical statistics. We 
should instead be guided by the need to restore the economy’s productive capacity 
and to transform it to match the expectations of our growing population. We can 
no longer continue to be an economy dependent on the production of primary 
commodities. 
The provision of modern energy services such as electricity is a measure of social 
and economic development. Consumers of energy services must pay for these and 
the excess funds will be used to extend the services to rural areas. The recently 
introduced prepaid meters will enable consumers to manage their electricity bills. 
This is expected to encourage them to pay their bills thereby improving revenue 
collection. 
The country is endowed with a variety of renewable and fossil energy resources 
which need to be exploited in a sustainable manner. Regional cooperation is 
essential for the development of large-scale hydropower resources. Small-scale 
hydropower projects may not make a significant impact on national requirements 
bt thehelp to deelop skills and to speed p access for remote commnities that and coal-bed methane can make a significant contribution to power generation in 
the short to medium term. Opportunities for regional cooperation also exist for oil 
and natural gas. 
Other renewable energy resources with great potential are solar geysers for 
household and industrial water heating, solar PV for lighting and power, biogas for 
cooking, and biofuels for transportation. Regional and international research and 
development opportunities are available for renewables and energy-efficient 
technologies. The local manufacture of energy technologies is important. With the 
exception of South Africa and some north African countries, most sub-Saharan 
countries do not have local manufacturing capacity even for basic components. 
The petroleum sub-sector has been liberalised and is operating efficiently and 
competitively. What is necessary is for industry players to assume greater 
responsibility for infrastructure investment through PPPs. Government has made 
its contribution in the existing pipeline, rail system and storage facilities. There is 
an urgent need for a second pipeline to extend service to neighbouring countries 
such as Botswana, Zambia and the southern Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
Recent reforms in the sector have also seen National Oil Company of Zimbabwe 
(NOCZIM) being unbundled to National Oil Infrastructure Company (NOIC) and 
Petrotrade to improve on efficiency. 
The Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) is now in place and is expected 
to create an enabling environment and establish fair play in the energy sector 
through licensing regulations, product and service standards and investment 
promotion. Currently there is no coordinated research, and there is no regulation 
of the solar industry. 
Manpower and capacity development are the key enablers that will ensure that we 
grow from being solely African players to becoming global participants. This is a 
vision that will ensure that we continue to develop and implement policies that 
provide socially, economically and environmentally sustainable energy services at 
least cost for all the people. 
I am in no doubt that the NEP will be instrumental in developing and accelerating 
the economic activity of the country, and I look forward to continued debate on 
the implementation of these policies. 
Finally, I trust that the NEP will achieve its main objectives, which are: to increase 
access to affordable energy services to all the citizens of Zimbabwe; to contribute 
to the eradication of poverty; to stimulate sustainable economic growth; and to 
reduce the country’s heavy dependence on energy imports.

MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND POWER DEVELOPMENT 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Introduction 
The NEP identifies the key challenges in the exploitation, distribution and 
utilisation of different energy resources, and provides broad policy objectives and 
strategies to address those challenges. The NEP has been formulated through 
extensive stakeholder consultation at all levels and sectors throughout society. The 
Policy contains strategies to translate the broad policy objectives into specific 
targets and actions in order to empower stakeholders to contribute towards the 
resolution and prevention of the recurring energy crises that have been facing the 
country. These strategies identify gaps between policy and practice and provide 
specific and actionable recommendations. The Policy is structured according to 
demand sectors, supply sectors, and cross-cutting issues. Demand Side 
The demand-side section highlights the issues and policy direction in the context of 
the five main demand sectors: agriculture, industry and mining, commerce and 
services, transport, and urban and rural households. The focus of the Policy in the 
commercial sectors is on the efficient use of energy in carrying out economic 
activities, and ensuring that an appropriate, reliable and good-quality supply is 
available. For households, both rural and urban, it is essential that access to 
energy services is increased – at an affordable price and in a sustainable manner. 
Basic energy needs should take into account cost, availability and health issues. 
However, the environmental effects of household energy use are severe in the 
rural areas, where people use wood as their primary source of energy for heating. 
Government will promote fuel-wood substitution as a way of conserving the fastdwindling wood resources. 
Supply Side 
The supply of energy relates mainly to the use of coal, petroleum products, 
electricity, gas and renewable energy. There are vast coal resources in the country 
that are presently underutilised. If used efficiently and sustainably, these 
resources can benefit the country in terms of economic growth, employment 
creation, self-sufficiency and trading power within the region. 
Coal that is mined in the country is currently being used in agriculture, industry 
and power generation; small quantities are exported. However, supply has been 
failing to meet demand in recent years, resulting in some industries having to 
import coal. This Policy has attempted to address this issue, as coal mining can 
increase employment in the country and is critical for the development of projects 
such as thermal power stations. Government will also investigate options for the 
use of local coal for liquefaction and the resource potential of coal bed methane. 
Clean-coal technologies, to reduce the environmental impacts of coal, will be 
promoted in all coal projects, small or large. Research will be conducted on 
suitable equipment for utilising indigenous coal. The coal industry will remain in 
private hands to encourage investment and competition. 
Petroleum products are the foundation of the transport sector and are presently 
regulated by Government. However, an independent regulator, ZERA, is 
responsible for sector-wide regulation with a common vision to protect consumers 
and ensure affordable pricing. It has always been Government’s intention to have 
minimum intervention and regulation in this industry to encourage competition and 
investment. The policy challenges lie in increasing diversification in the 
procurement of petroleum products, developing a pricing mechanism suitable for 
the country, and increasing the storage capacity for products so as to mitigate 
supply disruptions. Opportunities for the development of natural gas will be 
pursued with the objective of diversifying energy supplies in the country. Electricity supply and use is one of the most important aspects within the energy 
sector in Zimbabwe – in both supporting commercial activities and supplying power 
to domestic consumers. In order to improve the efficiency of the industry and 
attract private investment, Government will continue with its programme of 
encouraging Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to participate in the sector. It is 
also important that the supply infrastructure be continuously upgraded to meet 
the needs of industry and society. This also includes the sustainable use of local 
energy resources and ensuring tariffs are transparent and cost-reflective. Creating 
an infrastructure attractive to IPPs will allow more indigenous, local power 
generation, resulting in, among other things, an increased diversity of energy 
supplies and a reduction in energy imports. 
Renewable energy is a local resource that should be fully utilised, as it can bring 
both access to energy and environmental benefits. This includes the sustainable 
use of biomass resources (e.g. wood fuel, industrial waste such as bagasse, and 
pulp), hydropower, solar power and wind. Hydropower is presently being used in 
the country, contributing substantially to the national grid. There is a much 
greater potential, both in terms of grid connected and off-grid, to contribute 
towards rural power needs. Solar is also underutilised and programmes will be 
developed to ensure greater uptake of solar electricity and solar thermal 
technologies. 
Cross-cutting Issues 
In addition to the demand and supply of energy, a number of issues cut across all 
the sub-sectors. Zimbabwe is a landlocked country and hence is heavily dependent 
on energy imports, in particular of petroleum and electricity. Government 
therefore needs to ensure that there are strategic and buffer stocks, diverse 
supply routes for petroleum products, secure electricity supplies, and that local 
resources are maximised in terms of power generation. Security of energy supply 
can also be improved through the conservation of energy and the diversification of 
sources. 
Other cross-cutting issues include safety, health, the environment, energy 
efficiency, access to energy for low-income groups, gender, quality assurance and 
quality standards, research and development, pricing, energy planning, and the 
need to take cognisance of regional and international energy trade and cooperation. Policy recommendations on these issues have been developed in line 
with the policy objectives. These issues provide linkages with other sectors that 
impact on energy development. 
Government and Institutional Arrangements 
The fundamental principle for an efficient institutional framework and governance separating the legislature (law maker), judiciary (law interpreter) and executive 
(law implementer). At the energy-sector level, this is achieved by separating the 
policy-making role of the minister, the policy-monitoring role of the regulator, and 
the policy-implementation role of the energy service provider. Appropriate 
capacity-building should be undertaken so that each institution is able to discharge 
its responsibilities without interfering with the role of others. 
As far as is practicable, in order to clarify roles and minimise conflicts of interest, 
the institutional framework and governance of the energy sector will be guided by 
the following principles: the minister decides policy, the regulator monitors and 
enforces policy, and the energy service providers execute the policy. 
To avoid any role ambiguity, the relationship between the regulator and the 
ministry will be defined in a compact agreement. Licence terms and conditions 
will clarify the respective roles of the regulator and the energy service providers. 
The compact agreement must specify the regulator’s decision-making and advisory 
roles consistent with the law. 
The minister will take steps to build the capacity of ZERA rapidly in order to 
establish its credibility and legitimacy to key stakeholders, in particular to policymakers, investors, financiers and consumers. The compact agreement must specify 
the transitional period to full regulatory independence when there will be no 
need for Government representation on the ZERA Board. 
STAKEHOLDER NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS 
The country’s social and economic goals are defined in short-term or medium-term 
plans of up to five years. The current plan is the Zimbabwe Medium Term Plan 
(MTP) for the period 2011 to 2015. At the launch of the MTP, ministers indicated 
that it was a step towards the vision of a US$100 billion economy by 2030. Other 
documents that express energy-related needs are the Zimbabwe 2010 Millennium 
Development Goals Status Report, and the regional and international protocols and 
conventions to which Zimbabwe is a signatory. Five specific key needs emerge 
from a study of these documents. 
1. Economic Growth and Transformation 
According to the Medium Term Plan, the country’s overall development goal is ‘to 
transform the economy, reduce poverty, create jobs, maintain macroeconomic 
stability and restore the economy’s capacity to produce goods and services 
competitively …’
1
. The SADC Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan 
(RISDP) of 2003 states that ‘The overall goal of the Energy Sector is to ensure the 
availability of sufficient, reliable, least-cost energy services that will assist in the 
 
1
ZibbMdiTPl20112015 (HMiif EiPlid Iattainment of economic efficiency and the eradication of poverty whilst ensuring 
the environmentally sustainable use of energy resources.’
2
Energy is a key enabler for all the national priorities outlined in the MTP: 
infrastructure development; employment creation; human-centred development; 
entrepreneurship development' macroeconomic stability; ICT and science and 
technology development; good governance; investment regulation, coordination 
and promotion; resource utilisation and poverty reduction; and gender 
mainstreaming into economic activities. 
The specific strategic goal of the NEP is to increase access to sufficient, reliable, 
least-cost and environmentally sustainable energy services to support the 
transformation of the economy from primary commodity production to valueaddition, beneficiation and new knowledge-based industries, thereby creating 
jobs, reducing poverty and maintaining macroeconomic stability. 
This calls for a paradigm shift in energy-demand forecasting and in the planning 
and development of energy infrastructure. Extrapolation from historical demand 
shows a vicious circle in which energy shortages perpetuate economic 
underdevelopment. Integrated economic and energy-resource planning should help 
to establish the appropriate demand forecasts and development targets. 
2. Millennium Development Goals 
The achievement of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is an integral 
assumption of the MTP. The 2010 and previous MDG status reports note that the 
country has decided to prioritise the following MDGs: Eradicate Extreme Poverty 
and Hunger (MDG 1), Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women (MDG 3), and 
Combat HIV and AIDS, Malaria and Other Diseases (MDG 6). 
Although energy is not explicitly mentioned in the MDGs, the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in 2002 recognised that the 
provision of modern energy services was critical for the attainment of these goals. 
Energy policies and strategies will be designed to support the national priority 
MDG targets for the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, the promotion 
of gender equality and women’s empowerment, and combating HIV and other 
infectious diseases. 
3. Public–Private Partnerships 
The objectives of promoting competition, efficiency and investment in the energy 
sector are aligned to the MTP objective of ensuring that the ‘private sector will be 
the engine of economic recovery and growth in Zimbabwe, necessitating farreaching initiatives and reforms to reduce the risk for investors and make Zimbabwe an attractive investment destination. Accordingly Government will 
give priority to public–private partnerships (PPPs) in the following areas: ICTs, 
Local Government, Mining, Health, Water, Transport, Tourism and Natural 
Resources, Energy and Power Development, Agriculture, Social Amenities and 
Education.4
A complementary strategic goal of this energy policy is to improve the 
institutional framework and governance of the energy sector in order to 
ensure that the private sector becomes the engine for provision of energy 
services.
4. Regional and International Cooperation 
The SADC Energy Protocol, which was signed in 1996 and became operational in 
1997, recognises the importance of regional cooperation in ensuring the reliability 
and security as well as the cost-effectiveness of energy services. ‘The Protocol 
aims at the harmonisation of national and regional energy policies; cooperation in 
the development of energy and energy pooling; ensuring the provision of reliable, 
continued and sustainable energy services in the most efficient and cost-effective 
manner; promoting joint development of human resources and organisational 
capacity building; and cooperation in research, development, adaptation, 
dissemination and transfer of low-cost energy technologies.’5
On the international arena the country is a signatory to the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and related protocols that define the overall 
framework for inter-governmental efforts to tackle the challenges posed by 
climate change. All countries are expected to take precautionary measures to 
reduce or eliminate greenhouse-gas emissions and to mitigate their adverse impact 
on the environment. 
Consistent with regional and international strategies, protocols and 
conventions on climate change, a complementary energy policy objective is to 
ensure that Zimbabwe promotes research and development and the use of 
renewable sources of energy to support regional and international goals for 
increasing access to socially and environmentally sustainable energy services. 
5. Universal Access to Modern Energy Services 
The broad objective of increasing access to affordable energy services is expressed 
very succinctly by the strategic goal of the SADC Regional Energy Access Strategy 
and Action Plan of 2010 which is “to harness regional energy resources to ensure, 
 
3
 Zimbabwe, Medium Term Plan, 91.
4
 Zimbabwe, Medium Term Plan, 94.through national and regional action, that all the people of the SADC Region have 
access to adequate, reliable, least-cost, environmentally sustainable energy 
services and at the operational level that the proportion of people without such 
access is halved within 10 years for each end use and halved again in successive 5-
year periods until there is universal access for all end uses.’
6
Since it is unlikely that there is a single technology that can meet all the end-use 
needs for a given consumer, it is necessary to consider a portfolio of energy 
sources. This portfolio approach is superior to the common focus on technology, 
especially on electrification. Access to electricity is not the same as access to 
energy, because electricity does not fulfil all the energy needs at least cost. 
The ultimate objective of the NEP is to ensure universal access to a portfolio 
of modern energy services that fulfil the light, heat, static and motive power 
needs for enhancing economic productivity and quality of life. 
Conclusion 
Government’s overall development objectives can be fulfilled only through the 
implementation of this Policy. The strategies contained herein are designed to 
facilitate the implementation of the NEP by addressing the following issues: 
a) Ensuring policy clarity and awareness – the strategies help to clarify the 
NEP policy objectives by providing the policy details and a directory to the 
energy policies that exist in different documents. 
b) Ensuring consistency between policy and action – policy clarity and 
awareness helps to bridge the gap between stated policy and the actions of 
decision-makers. 
c) Identifying gaps – the strategies address gaps not covered by existing policy 
or legislation, or where the policy or law allows for different approaches. 
d) Providing a framework for regular energy-sector performance review and 
evaluation – ad hoc attention and response to energy issues has resulted in 
energy crises that force the country towards expensive ‘quick fix’ solutions 
instead of an orderly and least-cost energy-development programme. ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS

GLOSSARY OF TERMS...................................................................................................541. ENERGY AND DEVELOPMENT 
Energy is essential to social and economic activities and therefore every person 
has access to energy services of one kind or another. As a developing country 
the majority of the people in Zimbabwe are dependent on traditional and 
inefficient energy services that constrain their ability to enhance economic 
productivity and quality of life. There is a direct correlation between the level 
of a country’s development and the quality and quantity of its energy services. 
Therefore the thrust of the country’s energy policy is to ensure sustainable 
social and economic development through universal access to a portfolio of 
modern energy services to meet light, heat and power needs. 
Although Zimbabwe has vast and diverse energy resources, the per capita 
energy consumption is only 24.0 GJ (gigajoules),7 compared with an average of 
200 GJ for the developed countries. Appropriate policies need to be put in 
place in order to facilitate the development and use of these resources to meet 
the socio-economic needs of the population in an environmentally and 
economically sustainable manner. 
2. BACKGROUND 
2.1. ENERGY SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE 
The main sources of energy used in Zimbabwe comprise coal, wood fuel, 
electricity and petroleum fuels. According to the latest (2009) national energy 
balance, wood fuel provides the bulk (61%) of the total energy supply, followed 
by liquid fuels (18%), electricity (13%), and coal (8%). 
Thirty-seven per cent of households in Zimbabwe have access to electricity 
that is connected via power lines. There is a significant difference between urban and rural areas in their access to electricity. In urban areas 83 per cent 
of households have electricity, compared with 13 per cent in rural areas. 
Rural communities meet 94 per cent of their cooking energy requirements from 
traditional fuels, mainly firewood, and 20 per cent of urban households use 
wood as the main cooking fuel. Coal, charcoal and liquefied petroleum gas 
(LPG) are used by very few households (less than 1 per cent). A majority of 
urban households use electricity for cooking (73 per cent); in contrast, only 6 
per cent of rural households use electricity for this purpose.8 Most of the rural 
areas of Zimbabwe are facing a wood fuel shortage owing to, inter alia, the 
clearing of land for agriculture and unsustainable firewood harvesting. 
Zimbabwe is currently (2012) facing a shortage of electrical energy owing to 
internal generation shortfalls and the country imports all its petroleum fuels, 
at great cost to the country.
2.2. ZIMBABWE’S ENERGY RESOURCE BASE
Zimbabwe is well endowed with energy resources:
 Proven coal resources of 12 billion metric tonnes, situated mainly in the 
northern/north-western part of the country. Zimbabwe’s coals are 
generally of good quality, with calorific values ranging from 20 to 32 
MJ/kg (megajoules/kilogram). 
 Approximately 40 terra cubic feet (1.132 terra cubic metres) of coal bed 
methane (CBM). There is a need to establish the full potential and 
commercial feasibility of exploiting this energy resource. 
 Hydropower potential, concentrated along the Zambezi River, with 
potential also at many mini-hydro sites in the Eastern Highlands and 
dams across the country. 
 An annual daily average solar radiation over Zimbabwe of 20 MJ/m2
(megajoules/square metre).  An annual yield of wood fuel from natural forests, estimated at 4.6 
million tons. 
 An estimated 1.5 million tons of bagasse, produced annually from waste 
in the production of sugar from sugar cane in the Lowveld at Triangle 
and Hippo Valley Estates. With a strong agricultural base, Zimbabwe also 
produces large quantities of agricultural waste. 
Wind speeds over Zimbabwe (averaging 3 metres/second) are too low for most 
wind-based power-generation technologies, although wind energy has been 
used for a pilot power-generation project at Temaruru in Rusape and for water 
pumping at various sites around the country. 
Exploration of oil in the Zambezi basin was carried out by Mobil in the late 
1980s, covering Mana Pools, Kanyemba, Bumi Hills, Kariba, Mhangura, Mount 
Darwin, Binga, Hwange, Victoria Falls and Kamativi. 
Uranium and geothermal energy resources exist but need more exploration 
work to quantify. Uranium deposits are found in Kanyemba and geothermal 
energy resources occur in Binga and Hwange. 
 
3. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND GOVERNANCE 
The Ministry of Energy and Power Development has overall responsibility for 
energy issues in Zimbabwe. The Ministry’s terms of reference include policy 
formulation, performance monitoring and regulation of the energy sector, as 
well as research, development and promotion of new and renewable sources of 
energy. 
 The Ministry supervises and oversees the performance of state-owned 
enterprises – the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), the 
National Oil Infrastructure Company (NOIC), Petrotrade, and the Rural 
Electrification Agency (REA) – as well as Independent Power Producers 
(IPPs) such as Rusitu Power Corporation. 
 The Ministry, in conjunction with the Zambia Ministry of Energy and established by parallel legislation in Zimbabwe and Zambia under the 
Zambezi River Authority Act to operate, monitor and maintain the Kariba 
Dam complex and any other dams on the Zambezi River between the two 
countries. 
 The Ministry co-operates in energy issues with international and regional 
organisations, including the Southern African Development Community 
(SADC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), 
and the African Energy Commission (AFREC), among others. SADC 
coordinates regional cooperation and regional integration through the 
SADC Energy Ministers’ Forum and the SADC Task Force of Officials. 
Regional energy trade is carried through the Southern African Power 
Pool, whose coordination centre is in Harare. 
4. OPPORTUNITIES IN THE ENERGY SECTOR 
The opportunities that exist in the energy sector include: 
 The existence of abundant energy resources (e.g. biomass, coal, CBM, 
solar energy) in the country. 
 The existence of land and a climate favourable to the growth of energy 
crops. 
 Increased energy demand in the region.
 Government’s decision to diversify sources of energy.
 The existence of high-quality skills that can be harnessed to serve 
energy-sector requirements. 
 The availability of technologies such as coal-to-liquid conversion on the 
international market. 
 Opportunities for regional cooperation programmes (SADC, COMESA, 
AFREC, etc.). 
5. THE NEED FOR A NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY 
Energy policy plays a critical role as it provides the impetus for the production economy, and energy activities relate to both supply and demand. Energy is 
crucial to economic and social development, and to the alleviation of poverty. 
Zimbabwe is party to a number of conventions and agreements at a global 
level. Globalisation, the new international environmental agenda and market 
reforms are some of the new developments of recent years. Therefore 
Zimbabwe needs an energy policy that learns from, and takes advantage of, 
these emerging international developments. 
6. GENERAL POLICY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 
6.1. GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
The policy framework of the NEP is based on generally accepted principles that 
can be summarised by the following ‘Five As’, which address the need for 
energy services to be applicable, acceptable, affordable and available, with 
clear accountability for each policy and programme. 
a) Applicability – this is the principle that ensures the responsiveness of 
energy policies and programmes to stakeholder needs and expectations. 
Energy is not demanded for its own sake but as a means for enhancing 
economic productivity and quality of life. The goals and objectives of 
energy policies and plans must be focussed on the social and economic 
applications of energy. The different energy resources and technologies 
should be considered in relation to their applicability to the end-uses. The 
assessment of demand must include both the extrapolation of historical 
trends and scenarios for the transformation of society and the economy. 
b) Acceptability – this is the principle that ensures that the production and 
use of energy services is in accordance with acceptable standards. The 
technical quality and the social and environmental sustainability of energy 
products and services determine their acceptability to local and 
international stakeholders. There is global consensus on the need to is used to benchmark standards of safety, reliability, security, efficiency 
and the acceptable environmental and social impacts of energy production, 
transportation, distribution, supply and use. Sustainability requires energy 
efficiency and demand-side management to be embedded in all energysector strategies. The social impacts of energy on women and the girl-child 
are of particular interest, as they bear the burden of providing the 
country’s largest energy resource – wood fuel. 
c) Affordability – this is the principle that addresses the gap between 
policy rhetoric and reality. Energy pricing must be both cost-reflective 
and competitive in order to balance the need for investment viability and 
customer affordability. Cost-reflectivity assumes the adoption of least-cost 
energy-sector strategies and master plans, the regulation of investment 
returns and cost of service, and the effective targeting of subsidies. 
d) Accountability – this is the principle that addresses the need for every 
policy and programme to have someone accountable for development, 
monitoring and implementation. It is critical that there are clear 
institutional roles and responsibilities to ensure accountability for all energy 
products and services and to avoid or minimise the conflicts of interest 
inherent in policy-making, policy-monitoring and the delivery of energy 
services. 
e) Availability – this is the principle that addresses the key energy policy 
outcome, which is to reduce dependency on traditional energy services 
by increasing the availability of modern energy services. Consistent with 
the focus on applications, the availability of energy services refers to a 
portfolio of modern energy services that require the least cost to fulfil the 
different light, heat and power end-uses. The policies must ensure that the 
state of the market and the infrastructure is adequate for the production, 
transportation, delivery and utilisation of energy services. 
‘Access’ or ‘accessibility’ is sometimes used as one of the NEP principles. It is, acceptability, availability and affordability of the energy service and hence is 
embedded in the principles highlighted above. Statistics for energy access can 
be misleading because access is sometimes confused with availability. 
Availability is a necessary but insufficient condition for access. Power lines pass 
close to the premises of many rural customers, but they have no access to 
electricity because of affordability constraints. 
The development of Integrated Energy Resource Master Plans through 
stakeholder participation is the principal strategy for ensuring the practical 
application of the five principles. 
6.2. NEP GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 
The goal of the NEP is to provide a framework for the exploitation, distribution 
and utilisation of energy resources in fulfilment of the following broad policy 
objectives and principles: 
1. Increase the access of all sectors of the economy to affordable energy 
services through the optimal use of available energy resources and the 
diversification of supply options (applicability, availability, acceptability 
and affordability principles).
2. Stimulate sustainable economic growth by promoting competition, 
efficiency and investment in the sector (applicability and accountability 
principles).
3. Improve the institutional framework and governance in the energy sector to 
enhance efficiency and the delivery of energy services (accountability 
principle).
4. Promote research and development in the energy sector (applicability 
principle).
5. Develop the use of other renewable sources of energy to complement 
conventional sources of energy (applicability and acceptability 
principles).7. SUPPLY-SIDE POLICY MEASURES 
7.1. POLICY OBJECTIVE 
The main objective is to create and promote a conducive environment for 
energy-sector players to be able to identify and develop opportunities for 
energy supply that promote sustainable development. 
7.2. ELECTRICITY SUB-SECTOR 
7.2.1. Background 
There is a net deficit in the supply of electrical power in Zimbabwe. The power 
generated from Kariba, Hwange, Harare, Bulawayo, Munyati and Harare power 
stations and IPPs is not sufficient to meet current demand. The transmission 
and distribution network needs to be refurbished since it is obsolete. 
The electricity supply industry comprises three distinct market segments: 
generation; transmission and bulk supply; and distribution and retail supply. 
The generation and retail supply are competitive businesses, while transmission 
and distribution are natural monopolies. Because of the small size of the 
industry in Zimbabwe, generation and retail competition is for the market 
rather than within the market. 
Traditionally these three business segments have been owned and operated by 
a single, vertically integrated company. However, in recent years these 
segments have been unbundled and are now operated as separate businesses, 
either under combined ownership or under separate ownership. 
The electricity energy market in Zimbabwe has been developed and operated 
by local and central government from the early days of the electricity supply 
industry in the countryAt independence in 1980 Zimbabwe inherited an organisations: the Central African Power Corporation (CAPCO) (generation, 
transmission and bulk supply); the Electricity Supply Commission (ESC) (subtransmission, distribution and retail supply outside the four municipal areas); 
distribution and retail supply for the cities of Harare (Harare Municipality 
Electricity Department), Bulawayo (Bulawayo Municipality Electricity 
Department), Gweru (Gweru Municipality Electricity Department) and Mutare 
(Mutare Municipality Electricity Department). 
These utilities were managed under different Government departments. CAPC, 
the successor to the Federal Power Board, was a statutory corporation, jointly 
owned by the Governments of Zambia and Zimbabwe, that reported to a Higher 
Authority for Power (now called a Council of Ministers) comprising equal 
numbers of ministers from Zambia and Zimbabwe. The ESC was a parastatal 
that reported to the department or ministry responsible for power. The four 
municipal electricity undertakings were part of local authorities under the 
minister responsible for local government. 
The Electricity Act of 1985 [Chapter 13:05] and the Zambezi River Authority 
Act of 1987 [Chapter 20:23] provided for the amalgamation of these utilities 
into a vertically integrated parastatal called the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply 
Authority (ZESA). This restructuring was to improve governance of the sector at 
government level, achieve economies of scale, and provide for a uniform tariff 
structure. Although these objectives were achieved, there was no significant 
investment to match the growth in demand. ZESA’s main investments were two 
interconnections with Cahora Bassa and South Africa, which have provided 
much-needed imports to compensate for the lack of investment in local 
generation. 
To implement reforms, the Electricity Act of 2002 [Chapter 13:19] and the 
Electricity Amendment Acts of 2003 and 2007 restructured ZESA into a holding 
company, ZESA Holdings, a state-owned, vertically integrated utility with four 
subsidiary companies: the Zimbabwe Power Company (power generation); the 
ZibbEliiTiid DiibiC(ZETDC) Enterprises (manufacturing and support services, mainly for ZETDC and, to a 
lesser extent, the general public); and Powertel (telecommunications support, 
mainly to ZETDC and the general public). 
The Rural Electrification Fund Act [Chapter 13:20] provided for the unbundling 
of ZESA’s rural electrification functions. The Fund is managed by a Board that 
operates as the Rural Electrification Agency. This is the only function of the 
former parastatal that has been physically unbundled. 
The solution to the challenges facing the electricity sector lies in analysing 
these electricity-sector reforms and addressing the shortcomings identified. 
a) The Initial phase of reform is to have a well-developed policy and 
regulatory framework that takes account of international best practice 
but with modifications to suit local realities: the best practice at sector 
level is to separate the policy-making, policy-monitoring and policyimplementation functions and vest these in, respectively, a ministry of 
energy, an independent regulator, and public/private-sector service 
providers. At utility level the best practice is to unbundle into at least 
three separate business segments: Generation, Transmission, and 
Distribution & Retail. 
b) The Second phase of reform is to unbundle the accounting in order to 
set up the desired electricity market structure and test it: the policy and 
regulatory framework is applied to the existing utility before it is 
physically unbundled. To facilitate regulation and prepare for transition 
to the next phases of reform, the utility should be required by law to 
create separate accounting units for generation, transmission network, 
system operations, market operations, bulk supply, distribution network 
and retail supply, all of which do business at arm’s length. In each 
business, the accounts for the regulated and non-regulated activities 
must be separated. c) The Third phase of the reform is physical unbundling on the basis of 
operational efficiency and financial viability: the policy-makers and 
regulator undertake an appraisal of the performance of the accounting 
unbundling in order to determine the feasible physical unbundling model 
for the local realities. Experience has shown the need to have only one 
transmission network, system and market operator, and several 
generation, distribution and retail operators in order to avoid the abuse 
of market power, to extract efficiency gains, and to distribute these 
gains equitably. The availability of management and professional skills, 
technology and capital are some of the local realities to take into 
account. In many developing countries there is also a need to create a 
‘special purpose vehicle’ to manage legacy liabilities of the electricity 
sector. 
d) The Final phase of reform is privatisation in order to expand the investor 
base and to extract further efficiencies. The regulator must now 
coordinate with the competition agency to regulate the sector, in 
particular to prevent the abuse of market power: many sector reforms 
have suffered through the premature introduction of privatisation 
because of a failure to realise that its purpose is simply to build upon 
public-sector investment and operational efficiencies introduced through 
earlier policy and regulatory reforms. 
7.2.2. Challenges 
 Inability to meet demand. 
 Operational inefficiencies and poor financial performance. 
 Poor capital base and inadequate resources for infrastructure and 
equipment maintenance, leading to supply disruptions. 
 Non-cost-reflective tariffs, leading to low investment and poor service 
delivery. 
 Low investment.  Under-funding of the Rural Electrification Programme owing to 
uneconomic tariffs and the slow energy uptake by target communities. 
 Idle/underutilised infrastructure (e.g. small thermals). 
 Vandalism of infrastructure. 
 Old electricity infrastructure. 
 Brain drain and loss of experienced/qualified personnel. 
 Inadequate supplies of foreign currency for power imports. 
7.2.3. Policy Objectives 
 Ensure the availability, affordability and accessibility of electricity to all 
sectors of the economy. 
 Provide a platform for adequate and reliable access to electricity to all 
at competitive prices. 
 Allow access to IPPs and public–private partnerships, public–private 
associations and other joint ventures. 
7.2.4. Policy Measures 
 Classify the vandalism of transmission and distribution systems as 
economic sabotage. 
 Encourage the generation of electricity from biomass cogeneration and 
mini-hydro projects. 
 Facilitate grid extension that will unlock new supply opportunities in 
remote areas. 
 Adopt a pricing mechanism for electricity that is cost-reflective. 
 Adopt energy efficiency on the supply side. 
 Promote regional and international integration and cooperation, e.g. 
increased participation in the short-term energy market to address 
critical power shortages. 
 Improve investment opportunities to attract partnerships and mitigate  Observe environmental regulations in all power-sector projects. 
 Capacitate the Ministry, ZERA and ZESA to function efficiently in the 
reformed electricity market 
 Improve service delivery and revenue collection through smart and prepayment meters.
7.2.5. Strategies 
In line with international best practice, the Ministry will complete the first 
three phases of the electricity-sector reform programme by the end of 2012. By 
the end of 2013, the Ministry will complete the final phase. This exercise 
requires the amendment of the Electricity Act to remove the restriction on the 
privatisation of the transmission and distribution businesses of ZESA in order to 
create opportunities for the involvement of local private-sector investors and 
to improve efficiency through fairness and competition. 
The Ministry will unbundle the transmission and distribution business by 2013 in 
order to create the bulk-supply market that will facilitate and support IPP 
investments and serve as the basis for the transition to a more competitive 
wholesale market in future. Accounting unbundling will be achieved by the end 
of 2012 and physical unbundling by the end of 2013. 
As part of the electricity-sector reforms, a National Grid Services Company will 
be formed as a successor to ZESA Holdings and will assume responsibility for: 
legacy debt; transmission, system and market operations; bulk supply; regional 
cooperation; and technical advisory services to Government for system 
development planning, which is the key policy tool for the orderly and leastcost development of the power sector. 
The Ministry, with advice from ZERA and ZESA, will prepare a short-term to 
medium-term plan to reduce the impact of load-shedding during the period 
2012 to 2015, pending the development of new power-generation capacity. Government will co-ordinate the electrification programme, including the 
following activities: setting realistic electrification targets; determining 
allocation criteria and priority areas for electrification; ensuring the allocation 
and management of funds; financing and subsidising electrification projects; 
and determining the appropriate mix between grid and off-grid technologies. 
Government will support the establishment and implementation of sensitive 
but firm strategies to deal with non-payment, energy theft, and vandalism of 
infrastructure so as to minimise losses. 
Government will continue to facilitate the improvement of the electricitysupply infrastructure and thus improve the energy-supply service. 
7.3. FOSSIL FUELS SUB-SECTOR 
7.3.1. Background 
7.3.1.1. Upstream Petroleum Sub-sector 
The value chain for the petroleum industry comprises: exploration; production 
or drilling for crude oil or natural gas; refining; importation; transportation, 
storage and handling; and the wholesale and retail market. The upstream 
sector encompasses all activities from exploration to refining, while the 
downstream sector comprises the value chain from importation to the retail 
market. 
In the early 1960s the country decided to construct a pipeline from the port of 
Beira in Mozambique to transport crude oil to a refinery at Feruka near Mutare. 
The refinery is no longer operational, and the pipeline is now used to transport 
imported refined product. The country has not yet discovered oil or natural gas 
after the exploration undertaken in the Zambezi Valley. Consequently, current 
energy policies and legislation does not focus on the upstream sector. There is no specific institution with the responsibility to coordinate energy 
exploration in order to establish bankable resource levels. Exploration for 
energy minerals – mainly oil, natural gas and coal bed methane – has been 
undertaken by potential investors under special mining grants in accordance 
with the Mines and Minerals Act [Chapter 21:05]. Although mineral exploration 
and mining activities fall under the oversight of the Ministry of Mines in terms 
of the Act, it is important that there are legal provisions that empower the 
Minister of Energy and Power Development to have a role with respect to the 
exploration, development and utilisation of energy minerals for energy 
development. 
The upstream activities require technology, skills and capital outlays that only 
large oil corporations are able to provide. It is therefore necessary to exempt 
this sector from restrictive investment regulations but at the same time to 
encourage public–private sector partnerships. 
7.3.1.2. Downstream Petroleum Sub-sector 
The main petroleum products on the market in Zimbabwe are diesel, gasoline 
(petrol), kerosene (paraffin), aviation fuel (jet-engine fuel and piston-engine 
fuel), LPG and lubricants. The country currently imports 540 million litres of 
petrol and 630 million litres of diesel per year. In 1998, at the peak of the 
country’s economic production, there was a daily consumption of 3 million 
litres of diesel, 2 million litres of petrol, 0.6 million litres of jet fuel and 0.2 
million litres of paraffin. 
The petroleum sector was deregulated in August 2003. Prior to this the 
downstream petroleum sector was dominated by six players: NOCZIM, the 
state-owned oil company that was responsible for bulk procurement, 
transportation, storage and handling and also acted as a regulator; and the ‘big 
five’ multinational companies that were involved in transportation, storage and 
retail operations – TOTAL, SHELL, BP, MOBIL and CALTEX. When these players 
started to experience challenges in providing sufficient fuel to the market, Royal Oil, Country Petroleum, Wedzera Petroleum, Comoil, Exor Petroleum and 
Engen. 
Upon deregulation, the Government took over the regulatory function and 
licensed many more companies, thereby creating a very competitive market. 
Some of these companies could not survive the competition and fell by the 
wayside while others thrived. After removing its regulatory functions, the 
Government decided to unbundle the state oil company, NOCZIM, into a trading 
company, Petrotrade, and an infrastructure company, NOIC. 
The deregulation of the petroleum industry has created a very competitive 
market, which has so far managed to ensure the provision of petroleum 
products at regionally competitive prices. 
Infrastructure: Many market participants are traders using facilities that have 
been developed by others. There is a need for investment to expand 
transportation and storage facilities, including extending the infrastructure to 
serve rural areas. Current storage facilities have a capacity of only 500 million 
litres, which is less than three months of peak consumption, and there are less 
than 500 service stations, most located in urban areas. The existing pipeline 
can transport 120 million litres per month, which can be increased by 50 per 
cent through increasing pumping capacity. It is already operating at nearly 110 
million litres per month, which is close to its current maximum capacity. For 
the medium term, a second pipeline is needed, which could be designed for 
possible extension into neighbouring Botswana, Zambia and southern DRC. 
Government can no longer be expected to undertake any major investment 
beyond the maintenance of infrastructure it has already developed. It is now 
time for the oil companies to coordinate their efforts to deal with the 
infrastructure challenges. 
7.3.2. Challenges 
 The capacity of the pipeline is no longer adequate to meet demand Rail and road infrastructure have not been adequately funded or 
maintained over the years to cater for the easy movement of liquid 
fuels. 
 Monitoring and maintaining product quality. 
 No clear regulatory framework to govern upstream activities. 
 Low volumes of strategic reserves. 
 Lack of buffer stock owing to a shortage of funding. 
7.3.3. Policy Objectives 
 Ensure the security of product supply. 
 Ensure the viability of the industry. 
 Ensure that buffer stock is in the pipeline. 
 Ensure the optimal use of infrastructure. 
 Ensure the efficient use of fuel across the value chain. 
 Build a national strategic reserve. 
 Ensure the delivery of a quality and safe product. 
7.3.4. Policy Measures 
 Enhance security of supply through the diversity of fuel-supply sources. 
 Increase pipeline capacity and explore the construction of a second 
pipeline. 
 Reduce the fuel import bill by import substitution through the 
incorporation of biofuels and coal-conversion technologies, e.g. the 
expansion of ethanol production for blending with petrol. 
 Centralise the procurement of fuel to achieve economies of scale. 
 Optimise the use of transport infrastructure to minimise supply costs. 
 Promote the participation of indigenous entrepreneurs in the fuel 
industry.
 Ensure that petroleum products meet international specifications/  Promote investment in the rural areas. 
 Promote regional and international integration and cooperation.
7.3.5. Strategies 
7.3.5.1. Upstream Petroleum Sub-sector 
Government will ensure that there is a clear regulatory framework to govern 
upstream activities. There should be a licensing regime that defines the rules 
for the granting of exploration licenses and specifying the standard terms and 
conditions for the sharing of any production and the payment of royalties in 
case of discoveries. 
The proposed Energy Management Act will provide the legal authority for the 
Minister of Energy and Power Development to play an oversight role in the 
exploration, development and management of the utilisation of energy 
minerals for energy production. 
Because of the special expertise and technology required for upstream 
petroleum activities, Government will promote public–private partnerships in 
which political risks are assumed by the state and commercial risks are 
assumed by the private sector. Consistent with the policy on mining 
development, the following provisions will apply to public–private partnerships 
for the exploration and development of petroleum products: 
a) Government will hold at least 51 per cent shareholding in new mining 
projects, which shall be the minimum assumed value of the mineral 
resource. 
b) The development partner’s shareholding will be up to 49 per cent.
c) The development partner will provide debt for development. Dividends 
will be declared when the debt has been repaid or substituted. 7.3.5.2. Downstream Petroleum Sub-sector 
Government will increase the pumping capacity of the pipeline in phases to 
320 million litres per month from the current 120 million. Booster pumps will 
be installed to achieve the 320 million litre capacity. 
The Pipelines Act [Chapter 13:08] is designed to facilitate public–private 
partnerships for pipeline development on a BOT (build–operate–transfer) or 
BOOT (build–own–operate–transfer) basis. Government will construct a second 
pipeline and additional storage facilities using the BOT or BOOT route. 
The existing port facilities at Beira are limited, and there is need to consider a 
deep port such as Matola. Government will consider the rail route and rolling 
stock for Matola for commercial operation by 2013. 
Through ZERA, Government will maintain the existing cost-reflective pricing to 
ensure investment viability. Consolidation in the industry could help in 
creating economies of scale for infrastructure development. 
Strategic Reserves: A 90-day fuel cover will be maintained by the government. 
The funding for the strategic reserves will be covered by the strategic-reserve 
levy for the next five years. In the long term, the NOCZIM debt-redemption 
levy will be converted into a fund to help fund strategic reserves after the 
liquidation of NOCZIM debts. 
Through ZERA, Government will liaise with oil companies so that they maintain 
a 30-day strategic reserve. 
Product Quality: On several occasions, substandard fuel imports have come into 
the country. Government, through ZERA, will immediately purchase and deploy 
mobile laboratories for conducting on-site product-quality checks. 
Government will promote the use of biofuels in their pure form or blended with 
petrol or diesel so as to reduce the country’s import bill while at the same time 
reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. 7.4. COAL AND CBM SUB-SECTOR 
7.4.1. Background 
Coal is the locally produced fossil fuel that has been exploited for electricity 
generation, industrial heating and agricultural crop-processing needs, 
especially the curing of tobacco. 
The coal market is dominated by the Hwange Colliery Company, in which the 
government is the biggest shareholder. In recent years, a number of small-scale 
mining companies have entered the market. Many people have also been given 
special grants, but they have no expertise or capital to undertake exploration 
that will lead to the meaningful development of the resources. 
At its peak, the economy consumed 4.5 million tonnes of coal per year. About 
3.5 million tonnes was used for electricity generation, 0.5 million for coking 
coal, and the remainder for industrial heating and crop processing, especially 
tobacco curing. The market is currently down to 3 million tonnes, used mainly 
for power generation. 
In addition, the country is believed to be endowed with vast amounts of coal 
bed methane, which could be commercially exploited for power production and 
used as feedstock for a petrochemical industry. Investment in exploration has 
so far been lacking, and this potential energy resource remains unexploited. 
7.4.2. Challenges 
 Lack of funding and technology, resulting in the undercapitalisation of 
exploration and extraction. 
 Lack of clear principles for the pricing of coal. 
 Limited capacity of the railways to transport coal to centres of demand. 
 Lack of technical capacity. 
 A weak distribution network for coal.  Institutional arrangements for issuing grants. 
7.4.3. Policy Objectives 
 Fully explore coal and CBM resources. 
 Fully exploit coal and CBM in a sustainable manner. 
 
7.4.4. Policy Measures 
 Ensure adequate and reliable supplies of coal in a cost-effective and 
sustainable manner. 
 Ensure environmentally friendly exploitation methods. 
 Enhance competition within the sub-sector. 
 Ensure the smooth administration of energy minerals. 
 Explore the techno-economic feasibility of new coal technologies such as 
gasification and coal-to-liquid conversion. 
 Encourage economic pricing methods. 
 Encourage investment in the exploration and exploitation of CBM 
resources. 
 
7.4.5. Strategies
Government, through ZERA, will expedite the declaration of coal and CBM as 
energy sources and establish clear pricing principles in order to guide investors 
and customers. It is essential that the price is related to both quantity and 
quality, in particular to the energy content. The proposed Energy Management 
Act will include provision for the involvement of the Minister and ZERA in the 
application process for special grants for energy minerals. 
Government will explore the possibility of investing in a coal terminal in 
cooperation with Mozambican authorities to enable entry into the coal export 
market in a significant way. The export of coal should, however, be 
hd ith tiit ibltht tiThe proposed Exploration Company, if and when created, should carry out 
extensive exploration to establish bankable coal and CBM reserves. 
Government will seriously consider the potential for the conversion of coal into 
liquid fuel because this is likely to be a major stimulus for the growth of the 
local coal industry. To this end, the Ministry and the proposed Energy Research 
Council will address the need to develop a coal industry that is focused on 
using clean-coal technologies for power generation and for liquid-fuel and gas 
production. 
7.5. RENEWABLE ENERGY SUB-SECTOR 
7.5.1. Background 
7.5.1.1. Biomass 
Biomass, in the form of wood fuel, provides the bulk of total energy supply, 
and most rural areas are facing fuel-wood shortages as a result of agricultural 
land use and unsustainable harvesting. Demand for wood fuel already exceeds 
supply in Manicaland, Mashonaland East, the Midlands and Masvingo provinces, 
which are heavily populated. Mashonaland Central and Matabeleland North are 
fast reaching the same situation. 
It is estimated that more than 6 million tonnes of wood fuel are consumed 
annually when the sustainable output of natural forests is 4.6 million tonnes. 
This translates to a loss of 330,000ha of forest area, or over 60 million trees 
per year. At present the annual tree-planting rate is only 10 million trees. 
For the foreseeable future, wood fuel will continue to be used for cooking and 
space heating by rural and low-income urban households. It is therefore 
necessary for Government to establish an institutional and funding framework 
for developing and implementing strategies to deal with the wood fuel crisis. 
Cil fi81000 hf i24000 hf ld 70,000 tonnes and has potential for the generation of 150MW power and the 
creation of a more formalised wood fuel and charcoal market. Three companies 
– Allied Timbers, Border Timbers and The Wattle Company – generate over 
40,0000m3 of pine waste per year.9
Bagasse from sugar-cane processing has been used for electricity generation in 
the country for many years. The expansion of sugar-cane plantations for 
ethanol production presents an opportunity for expanding the use of bagasse 
for the generation of electricity. Hippo Valley and Triangle sugar estates 
generate 72.5MW for their own consumption and can sell up to 10MW of this to 
the grid. Additional bagasse is coming on stream in the Chisumbanje and Middle 
Save areas, where sugar plantations are being developed for ethanol 
production. 
7.5.1.2. Hydropower 
Large-scale hydropower on the Zambezi and small-scale hydropower on internal 
dams and perennial rivers represent a significant renewable energy resource 
for meeting local and regional electricity demand. Regional cooperation is 
essential for large-scale hydropower development, where there is excellent 
potential for export to countries that have the demand but not the hydro 
resources, such as South Africa and Botswana. 
Existing in-land dams have an estimated 20MW potential, and run-of-river 
schemes could generate 150MW. Proposed dams have a potential of 260MW, 
and the total energy potential is estimated to be between 90 and 120GWh/a. 
More accurate figures require feasibility studies that take into account the fact 
that the inland dams are primarily used for irrigation and drinking water. 
Consideration can be given to simplified regulatory requirements and feed-in 
tariffs for small-scale hydropower. This is a resource that can take advantage 
of carbon funding. 7.5.1.3. Liquid Biofuels 
In order to address the challenges of foreign-currency shortages for the import 
of petroleum products, the country introduced 15–20 per cent ethanol blending 
for petrol. This was based on production in the Lowveld (Triangle and Hippo 
Valley) of 40 million litres a year. In recent years the blending had been 
suspended. A new company, Green Fuel, has introduced 10 per cent ethanol 
blending as an initial phase to restore previous blending capacity and to expand 
production in the Chisumbanje and Middle Save areas to more than double their 
previous capacity. 
A subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe built a 100-million-litre-a-year 
biodiesel plant. Unfortunately, the country has not been able to produce 
sufficient feedstock to satisfy both food and fuel production requirements. As 
food needs take precedence over fuel, the Government has decided to promote 
the use of non-food crops such as jatropha and castor beans as feedstock for 
biodiesel. 
7.5.1.4. Animal Draught Power 
Most peasant agriculture in Zimbabwe relies on animal draught power. The 
Government has recognised the need for farm mechanisation, especially 
following the land-reform programme, which has resulted in many peasant 
farmers being allocated land that is too large to be farmed using cattle and 
donkeys. 
7.5.1.5. Solar 
The country’s solar energy potential of 16–20MJ/m2/day is greatly 
underexploited. At 3,000 hours a year, this can produce 10,000GWh of 
electrical energy per year. Donor-funded solar PV (photovoltaic) installations 
have been installed in many homes, businesses, schools and health centres 
since the launch of the Global Environment Fund initiative in the early 1990s. 
In addition to the Rural Electrification Agency, there are a lot of small and Solar lanterns have a great potential in improving lighting for rural households 
and institutions; prices range from US$10 to US$25, depending on their size. 
With local assembly, these prices can be reduced even further. 
Solar water heating for urban households and businesses could save significant 
amounts of fossil-fuel electricity. Its potential is greatly under-exploited 
because, so far, only a few private-sector businesses are in the market. It is 
estimated that there are 250,000 to 300,000 geysers in households. If all these 
are retrofitted with solar collectors, the saving in peak demand could be as 
much as 350MW to 500MW. Industries could also save a lot of power by using 
solar for pre-heating water. 
The major challenge with solar is the high up-front cost, which many users 
cannot afford. Several innovative solutions for subsidising access costs have 
been used elsewhere and can be tried here. Penalties for energy inefficiency 
can assist in funding subsidies for a solar geyser roll-out programme. Cost 
recovery can also be made over an extended period using electricity-bill 
savings. Local manufacture of imported components can help to lower costs. 
The power utility can fund this as a DSM (demand-side management) 
investment. Carbon credits are another source of funds. 
7.5.1.6. Other Renewables 
Wind speeds of 3 metres per second are too slow for significant power 
generation but can be used for water pumping. Geothermal potential of about 
50MW is estimated. There is significant but unquantified potential for biogas 
production from municipal sewage-treatment works and waste dumps. Fuel 
cells and lithium battery manufacture are other renewable energy technologies 
that can be investigated and promoted if feasible for the local market. Solar 
cooking, solar crop-drying and efficient wood fuel utilisation are other 
renewable options that are still at research and development stage. 
NEP stakeholder consultative workshops highlighted the need to have end-userd
ih d dlt bfllt f tidhave not yet been commercial successes as they do not fulfil stakeholder 
expectations and needs. 
7.5.1.7. Rural Energy 
The Rural Electrification Fund has provided a successful model for promoting 
and funding renewable-energy projects for electrification. By extending the 
mandate of the Fund to address all rural energy needs, the country will have 
the institutional framework and funding for all other renewable energy sources. 
The Rural Energy Fund to be created will be funded by levies that are allocated 
into separate accounts: 
a) The Electrification Account, with respect to levies and other fees 
charged on electricity services; this will continue to be used for 
electrification projects. 
b) The General Energy Account, with respect to levies and other fees 
charged on non-electricity licensees and customers; this will be used to 
support all non-electricity rural-energy-service projects and 
programmes. 
ZERA is required to appropriate to the Rural Electrification Fund any surplus 
from its electricity account and to invest surplus funds from the petroleum and 
general energy accounts as it deems appropriate. It is recommended that the 
non-electricity surplus funds be appropriated to the General Energy Account of 
the Rural Energy Agency. 
The Rural Energy Agency that will be established as the successor to the 
electrification agency will become the coordinating agency for nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), community-based organisations (CBOs), 
and other stakeholders currently involved in implementing energy projects on 
an ad hoc and uncoordinated basis. The Agency’s role is to develop rural energy 
master plans, fund projects that fulfil energy master-plan objectives, and 
provide training and establish quality standards to be followed and enforced 7.5.2. Challenges 
 Lack of aggressive promotion in households and commercial market. 
 Uncoordinated and unfocused research. 
 Poor back-up service, especially in remote rural areas. 
 Limited local experience and expertise with some technologies. 
 Resistance to new technologies by end users. 
 High up-front costs for the promotion and adoption of the technologies. 
 Lack of awareness on available options. 
 Inadequate funding for the sub-sector. 
 Lack of expertise to adopt and adapt to foreign technologies. 
7.5.3. Policy Objectives 
 Increase usage of and investment in renewable energy.
 Promote renewable energy as an environmentally friendly form of 
energy.
 Diversify supply options.
 Increase access to modern energy in rural areas.
7.5.4. Policy Measures 
 Adopt a long-term, government-driven, renewable energy technologies 
(RETs) programme, which encourages IPPs and public-private 
partnerships to harness sustainable RETs in Zimbabwe. 
 Institute innovative funding mechanisms and tap into financing 
opportunities such as Clean Development Mechanisms, feed-in tariffs, 
and micro-credit institutions for RETs. 
 Institute RETs-sustainable capacity-building programmes. 
 Raise awareness about the benefits and opportunities of renewable 
energy. 
 Encourage local production and the commercialisation of technologies.  Strengthen the institutional framework for research and development 
and the promotion of renewable energy technologies. 
 Promote investment into stand-alone solar energy systems to cater for 
rural communities. 
 Promote the efficient use of biomass for cooking. 
 Encourage the use of waste biomass for energy purposes. 
 Develop incentives for investment in renewable energy, e.g. subsidies 
and tax concessions. 
7.5.5. Strategies 
7.5.5.1. Biomass 
It will be the mandate of the proposed Rural Energy Fund to develop and fund 
strategies for resolving the wood fuel crisis in rural areas. In the meantime the 
Ministry will facilitate the implementation of the following short-term 
measures: 
a) Support the Forestry Commission to increase the tree-planting rate from 10 
million to 20 million trees per year by 2015 and to promote rural fencing 
using live trees. 
b) Support end-user-focused research, and awareness and education 
programmes, to increase the efficiency of wood fuel use. 
c) Improve collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and Natural 
Resources (including the Environmental Management Agency, EMA, and the 
Forestry Commission), the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and 
Irrigation Development (including the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Extension, AREX), the Ministry of Local Government, Rural and Urban 
Development, traditional leadership (Rural District Councils, chiefs, 
headmen, village heads) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (Police) to 
enforce existing and proposed regulations against the destruction of natural institutions who make heavy use of wood fuel to establish and maintain 
woodlots, penalties for the unauthorised cutting of trees, etc. 
d) Promote the use of alternative heating and cooking fuels such as coal, solar 
and biogas in rural households and institutions (boarding schools and 
hospitals) and in rural commercial applications such as bakeries, brick 
moulding and tobacco curing. 
Government, through ZERA, will develop regulations and mechanisms such as 
feed-in tariffs for approval by the Minister in order to promote the use of forest 
residue and bagasse as significant fuels for electricity generation. This will be 
done within a period to be advised to the Minister at the earliest opportunity. 
7.5.5.2. Hydropower 
The development of large-scale and small-scale hydropower, including run-ofriver schemes, is to be prioritised as a strategy for increasing the share of 
renewable energy as required by the Energy Regulatory Authority [ERA] Act 
[Chapter 13:23] and international obligations for environmentally sustainable 
energy services. The following specific targets and projects will be pursued in 
the short to medium term: 
a) Government will ensure that, by 2020, large hydropower and run-of-river 
schemes on the Zambezi contribute an additional 1,100MW and in-land 
small-scale schemes about 150MW. This will require immediately action to 
promote the proposed electricity-sector reforms such as creating a 
multiple-buyer market for IPPs and investment incentives such as 50 per 
cent reduction in taxes, licence fees and rates, which currently account for 
an uncompetitive 20 per cent of investment costs. The Electricity Act allows 
for a multiple-buyer market, but the current wholesale market policy, 
adopted on the basis of a 2004 electricity pricing study, assumes a singlebuyer market. 
b) Kariba South Extension, 300MW (financial closure by 2012 and c) Batoka, 800MW (financial closure by 2013 and commissioning by 2020). 
d) Inland dams and rivers: Pungwe phase 1 (6MW by 2013) and phase 2 (18MW); 
Tokwe Mukosi (12MW); Gairezi (30MW); Kondo (100MW). 
7.5.5.3. Liquid Biofuels 
To stimulate and sustain the development and expansion of biofuels the 
Ministry will establish, by 2012, long-term targets and timeframes for 
increasing the share of biofuels, in line with international best practice. In the 
interim, the following guidelines are provided: 
a) A minimum ethanol/petrol blend target of 20 per cent by 2015, and a 5 per 
cent biodiesel blend by 2020. 
b) Shift the focus from food crops (e.g. soya beans) to non-food crops (e.g. 
jatropha) for the production of biofuels. 
c) Promote out-grower schemes and mini-processing plants for smallholder 
farmers. 
d) Undertake research for the improvement of feedstock quality and yields and 
processing technologies. 
7.5.5.4. Animal Draught Power 
In collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation 
Development, the Minister will develop policies to address animal draught 
power requirements as well as the transition to more extensive farm 
mechanisation. This will be done at the earliest opportunity. 
7.5.5.5. Solar 
The Minister, through the proposed Rural Energy Agency and the power 
utilities, will establish a fund to promote the use of solar energy as a shortterm to medium-term strategy to address the electricity crisis. The immediate 
strategies and targets that can be implemented in the meantime are as a) Introduction of regulations by 2013 to mandate the installation of solar 
geysers in all new homes; penalties in the form of higher electricity prices 
or other methods can be imposed for non-compliance. 
b) Provision of incentives and raising awareness of the benefits of retrofitting 
solar collectors on existing geysers. 
c) Promotion of other proven solar technologies such as solar water pumping 
for off-grid borehole and river irrigation and solar PV-charged lights. 
d) Promotion of technology transfer and the expansion of local manufacturing; 
training of artisans and harnessing of the informal sector in the assembly 
and installation of solar geysers and solar PV. 
e) ZERA will establish cost-reflective renewable feed-in tariffs (REFIT) with 
appropriate subsidy mechanisms and other incentives to promote grid and 
off-grid power generation using solar and other renewable energy resources. 
7.5.6. General strategies 
The Ministry will initiate the process of developing a Rural and Renewable 
Energy Act that will establish a Rural Energy Fund to be the successor to the 
Rural Electrification Fund with an expanded mandate to promote the provision 
of electricity and other modern energy services to rural areas using renewable 
energy resources to the maximum extent possible. Levies raised from 
electricity services will continue to fund rural electrification, while petroleum 
and general energy levies will fund general energy projects and programmes. 
The Fund will be managed by a Rural Energy Agency that will be a successor to 
the Rural Electrification Agency. Pending the completion of these formalities, 
the Ministry will use existing resources and institutions to extend the full range 
of renewable-energy service technologies to rural areas. 
The Minister will, in collaboration with the national designated entity for the 
Clean Development Mechanism or similar scheme, promote the use of carbon 
credits for eligible projectsZERA ill deelop and recommend to the Minister renewable energy resources. This will be done within a period to be advised to 
the Minister. 
The proposed Energy Research Council will promote focused research on the 
use of renewable resources to meet end-user needs and expectations. 
Educational programmes will be introduced at primary and secondary schools 
to raise awareness on renewable energy. 
7.6. NUCLEAR ENERGY SUB-SECTOR 
7.6.1. Background 
Zimbabwe is reported to have about 25,000 tonnes of uranium around the 
Kariba and Kanyemba areas that can be exploited for power generation. 
Nuclear energy is not currently being used to produce power in the country. 
There has been a change in policy regarding nuclear energy the world over, 
with many countries reviving their nuclear power programmes. Nuclear power 
is a clean source of energy and the country should explore the possibility of 
adopting this technology in the long term. 
7.6.2. Challenges 
 Actual quantities of the resource have not yet been determined.
 Experts to exploit the technology are not available.
 No legislation exists to support the technology.
 There are no institutional arrangements to govern the use of nuclear 
power. 
7.6.3. Policy Objectives 
 Explore the feasibility of nuclear energy as an alternative source of 
energy. 
Diifthf l7.6.4. Policy Measures 
 Promote the development and application of nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes. 
 Carry out investigations into the nuclear option as a future energy 
source. 
 Build capacity in exploiting nuclear energy. 
 Promote research and development into the peaceful application of 
nuclear science and technology. 
 Promote regional and international co-operation in nuclear science and 
technology.
 Identify a strategic partner in the development of a nuclear power 
station. 
7.6.5. Strategies 
A nuclear energy policy will be developed to enable the country to benefit 
from fuel exports or nuclear power generation. International cooperation 
through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will allow the country to 
learn from the experience of other countries. 
The country will continue working with IAEA and AFRA (the African Regional 
Cooperative Agreement for Research, Development and Training related to 
Nuclear Science and Technology) in the peaceful use of nuclear energy by: 
a) Strengthening the regulatory framework. 
b) Enhancing technical cooperation projects. 
8. ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN DEMAND-SIDE SECTORS 
8.1. Background commercial energy, particularly electricity. Energy savings have ripple effects 
throughout the whole economy because the productive sectors most affected 
by power cuts will have more power available for production. 
Unemployment is currently high and most households are poor. In poor 
households, wood fuel and charcoal are the main energy sources used, while 
kerosene lamps and candles are used for lighting. Different types of fuel have 
different end-uses, which militates against the efficient and rational use of 
energy. Furthermore, low-income households tend to purchase cheap and 
unsafe appliances, thus increasing the risk to their health. 
There is unexploited potential for using LPG or kerosene to address the 
cooking-fuel challenges for the majority of the population, who either have no 
access to electricity or are unable to afford the cost of using it for cooking and 
heating. In order to preserve natural forests, some countries, notably Mauritius 
in the SADC region, have successfully made a transition from wood fuel to LPG 
as a household fuel. Table 1 demonstrates the competitiveness of LPG as a 
household fuel.

The electricity cost of cooking is subsidised for low-income consumers, yet the 
LPG cost, which is based on market prices, is lower. Prices in the electricity 
tt titflt tht f thdlt f The promotion of LPG will need to address the need for affordable gas stoves 
and to deal with safety perceptions. Government and industry will need to 
work on an educational and promotional campaign. Most rural households, who 
are unlikely to be connected to the grid or to have access to LPG (determined 
by the availability and affordability), could use biogas as an alternative fuel. 
Government is planning to roll out the use of biogas in rural institutions 
(schools and hospitals) for heating and cooking. Biogas digesters could also be 
used in urban areas. 
The numerous problems experienced with wood fuel and charcoal will require a 
combination of policies that cover the efficiency of energy use, energy 
conservation, and a switch to modern forms of energy in certain cases. In rural 
areas, there is need for access to electricity, especially for communal 
facilities. More affluent households in urban areas generally use electricity, but 
this percentage is very small. 
Overall, the national utility cannot meet the demand of industry, so it is 
necessary to increase the level of power generated to cater for this sector. A 
lack of expertise in industry has also been identified as one of the key barriers 
to increased energy efficiency: most industries in Zimbabwe use a large amount 
of electricity inefficiently. Implementing energy-efficiency programmes will 
not only reduce consumption but will also reduce operating expenses. 
The commercial sector includes, among others, wholesale and retail shops, 
hospitals, hotels, restaurants and recreation centres. Overall, the demand for 
energy in the sector is met mainly by commercial electricity and petroleum. 
Power demand for both existing and new mines is currently met by grid 
electricity, which is in short supply. Mining companies will be encouraged to 
generate their own power and to cooperate in the development of power 
infrastructure. They will be encouraged to develop surplus power from autogeneration which will be sold to neighbouring communities. The transport sector is a major user of petroleum products, and all of its needs 
are met by imports. Although road transportation is predominant, various forms 
of transportation play vital roles in the lives of the rural populace. Although 
some regulation is in place, inefficient practices abound in the sector. 
The economy of Zimbabwe is dependent on agriculture. Subsistence farming is 
the most common activity, and women are the main stakeholders in most 
agricultural activities. Human and animal power are the dominant sources of 
energy in subsistence-farming activities. The drying and processing of 
agricultural products is managed by traditional applications of solar energy and 
firewood. Many agricultural activities contribute towards deforestation through 
extensive farming and slash-and-burn practices. 
The main energy challenge within agriculture is to ensure a supply of sufficient 
and cost-effective energy to meet the requirements for improved agricultural 
activities, including agro-processing and irrigation. There is a need to create a 
commercial environment and to encourage entrepreneurs to develop and 
distribute energy products and technologies in order to improve efficiency in 
agricultural production and add value to agricultural products. Furthermore, 
methods and approaches to maximise the use of alternative sources of energy 
such as, micro-hydro, solar, wind, biomass, and other renewable energies, 
need to be developed and commercialised. 
8.2. Challenges 
 A threat to the sustainability of forest resources owing to large-scale use 
of wood resources, increasing demand for arable land, and urban 
expansion. 
 Inefficient production of biomass and the use of inefficient technologies, 
resulting in adverse effects on the environment and the health of 
biomass-energy users. 
 Insufficient awareness among energy end-users about energy 
conservation possibilities and practices, thus hampering investment in  Poor development of competitive alternative-energy sources, a lack of 
incentives, including financing mechanisms, for their development, and 
insufficient incentives to introduce fuel/technology substitutes. 
 Low public awareness and uptake of the efficacy and potency of 
renewable energy technologies. 
 A dominance of aging, energy-inefficient technologies. 
 Over-dependence on human and animal energy in rural areas. 
 Inadequate funding to finance energy efficiency and conservation 
initiatives. 
 Society’s resistance to technological change. 
8.3. Policies 
 Increase the accessibility and affordability of sustainable energy in all 
energy demand sectors. 
 Promote energy efficiency and conservation and the development of 
holistic programmes for all energy demand sectors. 
 Ensure that energy efficiency and conservation programmes are planned 
and implemented in a fully participatory manner. 
 Provide electricity end-use infrastructure at affordable prices to improve 
the rural household energy situation and to attract entrepreneurial 
activity in rural areas. 
 Encourage the use of alternative sources of energy for different 
applications in all energy demand sectors. 
 Promote mandatory energy audits and regulate energy efficiency and 
conservation in all energy demand sectors. 
 Promote investment in energy efficiency and energy conservation 
programmes. 
 Adopt energy efficiency standards and best practices. 
 Promote and support industries that have the capacity to produce 
demand-side equipment and to manufacture it for local and regional 
applications.  Encourage all farmer-training programmes to include tuition in energyuse efficiency and energy planning, and technology selection and 
operation, as well as planned maintenance. 
8.4. Strategies 
8.4.1. Households and Institutions 
The Minister will set targets and introduce a transitional programme to reduce 
the country’s dependence on unsustainable wood fuel resources by converting 
to the use of electricity, petroleum products and biofuels, especially LPG in 
urban areas and biogas in rural areas, as cooking and heating fuels. The 
proposed Rural Energy Fund and Agency will be the institution that implements 
the programme on a sustainable basis. In the meantime, as highlighted above, 
the Ministry will promote these using existing resources. 
Government will develop a comprehensive Household Energy Plan, which will 
adequately address issues related to shortages, the inefficient use of biomass, 
and the affordability of modern energy services. 
Government will supply and inject 4.5 million compact fluorescent light bulbs, 
and will introduce a prepaid metering system so as to reduce peak demand. 
Government will promote the development and dissemination of improved 
cooking technology as part of the wider strategy to reduce wood fuel 
consumption. 
Government will ensure the integration of energy within broader rural 
development interventions by forging dialogue and co-ordination among the 
agencies and communities involved. 
Government will develop and implement national awareness-raising 
programmes and action strategies aimed at improving energy savings and 
conservation, education and information dissemination on energy-technology 
options, costs and technical know-how. Government will develop awareness-creation programmes and action strategies 
aimed at improving energy savings and conservation in urban households. 
Government will promote the use of suitable alternatives to wood fuel – such as 
LPG, paraffin, electricity and wood fuel briquettes – and solar cookers will be 
advocated. 
Government will promote the use of biogas for cooking in both households and 
institutions. Biogas digesters will be installed in institutions such as schools and 
hospitals to reduce wood fuel usage and power bills. 
8.4.2. Mining and Industry 
Government will develop training programmes and incentives aimed at 
encouraging the adoption of more efficient technologies, machinery and 
processes. 
Government will offer financial incentives for energy efficiency, e.g. the 
introduction of ‘time-use’ electricity tariffs.
Government will promote energy efficiency awareness and will encourage the 
use of energy-efficient practices within the sector. 
Government will encourage industry and mines to provide their own power 
supplies and increased the energy mix in energy generation and distribution. 
Government will facilitate public–private sector partnerships as a way of 
optimising the application of technology in energy-use management. 
8.4.3. Transport 
The feasibility of introducing measures for pollution control will be explored, 
including using environmentally friendly fossil fuels – e.g. unleaded gasoline, 
blend petrol, low-sulphur diesel – and the importation of more fuel-efficient 
vehicles. Government will promote energy-efficiency awareness and conservation and 
will encourage the use of energy-efficient vehicles. 
Government will integrate and harmonise implementation of the various 
national policies related to the transport sector. 
Government will promote the development and use of alternative fuels such as 
biodiesel and ethanol blending. 
8.4.4. Agriculture 
Government will promote measures to improve the efficiency of energy use in 
agriculture, such as the provision of information and the use of low-energy 
equipment. 
8.4.5. Commerce 
Government will emphasise the adoption of energy-demand management and 
the implementation of energy-conservation measures in institutional buildings 
and in Government departments. 
9. CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES 
9.1. Background 
A number of issues cut across all the energy sub-sectors. These constitute the 
institutional framework and governance, energy policy and planning, 
regulation, research and development, and gender issues. Clear policies are 
needed for these issues since they all affect the energy sector directly or 
indirectly. 
9.2. Challenges 
 Uncoordinated planning. 
 Uncoordinated research. 9.3. ENERGY POLICY AND PLANNING 
9.3.1. Background 
Energy policy and planning involves the collection, recording and storage of 
data. These data will then be used as the backbone of the policy-making 
process. There is therefore a need to develop systems to assist in the 
acquisition, analysis and storage of such data. Zimbabwe is yet to develop an 
integrated energy plan. 
The integrated energy plan will address energy demand balanced with energy 
supply, transformation, economics, gender and environmental considerations, 
along with the available resources. By addressing the integrated energy plan 
under the umbrella of different scenarios, it is possible to take into account 
the various consequences of each scenario. 
9.3.2. Policy Measures 
The policy measures to plan effectively for energy provision are to: 
 Identify secure and reliable sources of energy information and data. 
 Disseminate energy data regularly. 
 Adopt an inclusive energy-planning approach. 
 Ensure environmental considerations in energy supply, transformation 
and end-use. 
9.3.3. Strategies 
Government will enact an Energy Management Act to: 
 Formalise the energy policy and planning process by defining the roles of 
different stakeholders and creating the relevant legal and institutional 
framework (e.g. establishing a National Energy Advisory Council, a multistakeholder policy advisory forum with different working groups). 
 Empower the Minister to collect all relevant energy data and information  Provide for the funding of energy research and development. 
 Recognise and define the appropriate role of the Minister in awarding 
and managing special grants for the exploration, development and 
utilisation of energy minerals such as coal, gas, oil and nuclear-energy 
source materials. 
 Define the principles for resolving ambiguities in the roles of the 
Minister, other government departments and agencies, the energy 
regulator and other regulators (such as the Competition and Tariff 
Commission) in formulating, monitoring and enforcing energy policies 
and standards. 
 Provide for the issuing of regulations by the Minister on all matters 
related to energy management, such as competition for the market by 
IPPs, the target energy-resource mix for power generation, guidelines 
for embedding cross-cutting issues in integrated energy resource plans, 
etc. 
The Ministry will, in accordance with procedures to be outlined in the proposed 
Energy Management Act, develop and review integrated electricity energy 
resource master plans so as to increase the proportion of electricity generated 
from renewable energy resources for environmental sustainability. ZERA will 
take account of the integrated resource master plans in licensing new capacity. 
The Ministry will continue building capacity for policy and planning through 
cooperation with regional and international organisations. 
9.4. GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
9.4.1. Background 
The prevailing institutional arrangements need to be clarified and 
strengthened. Currently, roles of different players in the sector vis-à-vis the 
role of government are not very clear. It is necessary to improve institutional 
arrangements to bring about more effective coordination of the various accountability and transparency, and develop synergy between the different 
players. 
The fundamental principle for an efficient institutional framework and 
governance is to minimise the conflicts of interest that are inherent in making, 
monitoring and implementing policy. At the national governance level this is 
achieved by separating the legislature (law maker), judiciary (law interpreter) 
and executive (law implementer). At the energy-sector level this is achieved by 
separating the policy-making role of the Minister, the policy-monitoring role of 
the regulator and the policy-implementation role of the energy service 
provider. Appropriate capacity-building should be undertaken so that each 
institution is able to discharge its responsibilities without interfering with the 
role of others. 
9.4.2. Challenges 
 Direct involvement in the regulation of the sector. 
 Unclear roles of government, utilities and regulators. 
 Coordination with other ministries and organisations on energy resources 
that do not fall directly under the Ministry. 
9.4.3. Policy Measures 
 Improve institutional arrangements. 
 Promote legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks to create 
consumer and investor confidence. 
 Enhance corporate governance and accountability in energy institutions. 
9.4.4. Strategies 
As far as is practicable, in order to clarify roles and minimise conflicts of 
interest, the institutional framework and governance of the energy sector will 
be guided by the following principles: the Minister decides policy, the regulator 
monitors and enforces policy, and the energy service provider executes the The proposed Energy Management Act will include legal provisions to empower 
the Minister of Energy and Power Development to have oversight over all 
energy resources and energy-related cross-cutting issues such as energy pricing, 
product and service quality, energy efficiency and demand-side management. 
The apparent duplication of roles between the regulator and the Minister will 
be resolved by the Energy Management Act, based on the principle that the 
regulator has the fundamental role of monitoring and enforcing policy while 
the Ministry’s fundamental role is to decide the relevant energy policies and 
plans that will then be monitored and enforced by the regulator. 
9.5. REGULATION 
9.5.1. Background 
Regulation of infrastructure services can be defined as ‘the combination of 
institutions, laws, and processes that, taken together, enable a government to 
exercise formal and informal control over the operating and investment 
decisions of enterprises that supply infrastructure services.
10 Perfect 
competition is theoretically the most efficient regulatory system. In practice, 
conditions for perfect competition do not exist, and it is necessary for 
government to intervene in order to protect investors and consumers from the 
consequences of market imperfections, such as abuse of monopoly market 
power that leads to the provision of poor and high-cost products and services, 
or collusion to fix prices or engage in other anti-competitive activities. 
The regulation of the energy sector has evolved over the years as a shared 
responsibility between different government departments, state energy 
enterprises and parastatals. The major weaknesses of this traditional 
regulatory system are a lack of transparency, conflicts of interest and weak 
coordination, which often lead to poor and inevitably contradictory decisions on such key issues as prices, product quality and service standards, with 
adverse impacts on investment and consumption. 
The Electricity Act of 2002 established an electricity regulatory commission, 
ZERC, and the Petroleum Act of 2006 [Chapter 13:22] created a similar 
regulatory agency for the petroleum sub-sector. Recognising the scarcity of 
human and material resources and the similarity of function, Government 
decided, through the Energy Regulatory Authority Act of 2011, to create ZERA 
to deal with these two sub-sectors and any other energy sub-sector to be 
defined by the Minister on the recommendation of the regulatory authority. In 
establishing ZERA, Government also sought to address the weakness in the legal 
framework that did not provide the adequate degree of independence required 
for regulatory efficiency. 
9.5.2. Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) 
ZERA was established by the Energy Regulatory Authority Act of 2011 ‘to 
regulate the procurement, production, transportation, transmission, 
distribution, importation and exportation of energy derived from any energy 
source’ (section 4(1)(a)). The Electricity Act and the Petroleum Act define the 
legal framework for the regulation of these sub-sectors, while the ERA Act, 
section 7, provides the legal framework for extending regulation to other 
energy sub-sectors. 
The Act gives ZERA independent decision-making authority for clearly defined 
functions that are critical for ensuring operational, financial and investment 
efficiency in the energy sector: ‘Subject to this Act, the Authority shall not, in 
the lawful exercise of its functions under this Act, be subject to the direction 
or control of any person or authority (section 4(4)). 
9.5.2.1. Roles of ZERA 
The decision-making role of the Authority is principally concerned with the 
development, monitoring and enforcement of product and service standards, energy prices, dispute resolution, and the issuing, enforcement, renewal, 
amendment or cancellation of licences. 
The respective roles shown in Figure 1 need to be respected in order to 
maintain the regulator’s independence. A compact agreement between the 
Minister and ZERA can help to clarify roles in the same way that license terms 
and conditions clarify the expectations of the regulator to the energy market 
players. 
Figure 1: Institutional Roles 
9.5.2.2. Market Structure and Competition 
Market structures evolve on the basis of whether a product or service can be 
more efficiently provided through competition within the market or, in the present, the electricity market is dominated by the vertically integrated, stateowned ZESA Holdings. The petroleum market is deregulated, with many players 
in the trading business, but it still dominated by the public sector and 
multinationals in storage and transportation infrastructure. The rest of the 
energy services are provided through informal and formal, community and 
private-sector markets. The largest energy resource, wood fuel, is supplied 
largely through the free exploitation of natural forests in rural areas. 
If competition in the market is approved, the regulator has to monitor the 
effectiveness of the competition and ensure access to essential facilities which 
may be owned or managed by a natural monopoly. The regulator also has to 
deal with any ‘stranded costs’ that cannot be recovered and subsidies that 
cannot be maintained after deregulation. Where there is evidence of anticompetitive behaviour, ZERA has to take appropriate corrective action, 
including referring the matter to the Competition and Tariff Commission. 
9.5.2.3. Pricing 
The most common price-control approaches are price caps, revenue caps or 
investment return caps. A cap is a way of simulating competition. In a 
competitive market the price is determined by market forces of supply and 
demand. Market players are obliged to operate on the basis of the market price 
and adjust their supply-and-demand patterns accordingly. Suppliers who cannot 
cover their costs at the market price go out of business. Consumers who cannot 
afford the market price switch to alternative products or go without. 
The energy regulator has to establish a cap that fulfils the need for investors to 
have prices that reflect the costs of efficient operation and the need for 
consumers to fulfil their basic energy needs at competitive prices. Particular 
attention needs to be given to the basic energy needs of low-income groups, 
mostly the rural population and urban poor. 
9.5.2.4. Challenges  Duplication of roles between the Ministry and ZERA and between ZERA 
and the Competition and Tariff Commission. 
 A lack of transparent regulations for IPPs. 
9.5.2.5. Policies 
 Define clearly the roles of ZERA in relation to the Ministry and the 
Competition and Tariff Commission. 
 Create, promote and preserve an efficient energy industry. 
 Provide incentives for energy efficiency and demand-side management. 
 Have clear pricing and subsidy policies. 
9.5.2.6. Strategies 
To avoid any role ambiguity between the regulator and the Ministry, 
Government will define the relationship between the two institutions in a 
compact agreement. Licence terms and conditions will clarify the respective 
roles of the regulator and the energy service providers. The compact 
agreement must specify the regulator’s decision-making and advisory roles 
consistent with the law. 
The Minister will take steps to rapidly build the capacity of ZERA in order to 
establish its credibility and legitimacy to key stakeholders, in particular the 
policy-makers, investors, financiers and consumers. 
Government, through ZERA, will continually monitor market operations to 
ensure that energy products and services are being provided competitively. 
Where there is evidence that a service can be provided more efficiently 
through competition within the market, ZERA will recommend deregulation for 
approval by the Minister. 
To promote coordination and to avoid conflict between ZERA and the 
Competition and Tariff Commission, ZERA will be responsible for developing 
and implementing regulations to prevent anti-competitive market conduct, market power. The Competition and Tariff Commission will not, however, 
usurp the role of the energy regulator in deciding energy prices or any other 
regulatory matters defined in energy policy and legislation. 
In recognition of the urgent need for the least-cost development of power 
generation, the Minister, in consultation with ZERA, will, within the earliest 
possible period, complete the development of transparent regulations 
governing competition for the market by IPPs. 
ZERA will incorporate in licences and regulations explicit principles and 
measures for embedding energy efficiency and demand-side management, 
environmental protection and gender, and other energy cross-cutting issues 
related to the quality and sustainability of energy services. 
In energy pricing the Minister will make decisions on subsidy policies and 
pricing methodologies recommended by ZERA, and the regulator will decide 
independently on the price, revenue or rate of return caps according to the 
approved methodology. The Minister and regulator will ensure that the costs 
allowed in calculating energy prices are the least-cost in accordance with 
explicitly defined benchmarks. Integrated energy development master plans 
will be used to provide an indication of the lowest long-run marginal costs as 
benchmarks for evaluating competition for the market. 
ZERA will declare coal, oil, natural gas, coal bed methane, uranium and other 
nuclear energy material as energy resources in terms of the ERA Act. It will also 
define the appropriate regulatory framework, including in particular the pricing 
principles for power-generation applications and general consumer end-uses. 
This will be done within a period to be advised to the Minister at the earliest 
opportunity. 
ZERA will provide the Minister with sufficient information and data to enable 
the objective determination of affordability and thereby establish targeted 
subsidies and subsidy funding mechanisms to facilitate access to modern energy 9.6. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
9.6.1. Background 
Energy research and development is undertaken on an uncoordinated basis by 
institutions of higher learning, the Scientific and Industrial Research and 
Development Centre, and donor-funded NGOs. There is no policy defining a 
target budget and funding for energy research and development. Section 24 of 
the Research Act [Chapter 10:22] provides for the establishment of research 
councils and research institutes on the recommendation of any responsible 
Minister. The Minister of Energy is therefore empowered to recommend the 
establishment of an Energy Research Council in terms of that Act. 
9.6.2. Challenges 
 Uncoordinated energy research. 
 No funding for research. 
 Unfocused research not addressing the country’s needs.
9.6.3. Policies 
 Coordinate energy research in Zimbabwe. 
 Promote energy-related research for better exploitation of the country’s 
energy resources (solar wind, geothermal and nuclear). 
 Develop or adapt energy technologies to suit the Zimbabwean situation. 
 Encourage research into socio-cultural aspects of energy use in order to 
foster wider adoption of more efficient energy technologies and 
practices. 
9.6.4. Strategies 
The Minister will, through section 24 of the Research Act, recommend at the 
earliest opportunity the establishment of an Energy Research Council to 
facilitate the coordination of all energy research and development in the budget and funding mechanisms for energy research. In the meantime the 
surpluses from ZERA levies that are not legally required for Rural Electrification 
can be used to support energy-research activities. 
9.7. GENDER AND ENERGY 
9.7.1. Background 
Gender issues have come to the forefront in many development sectors, but 
the energy sector has been slow to acknowledge the links between gender 
equality, energy and development. Energy and the roles of women and men are 
socially and culturally linked in many diverse ways. These linkages evolve over 
time and vary across income groups, between urban and rural households, and 
from region to region. Some of these variations affect both men and women in 
the same way. However, the role of women in energy provision and their 
participation in different facets of the energy sector have not been sufficiently 
addressed. Therefore, in addressing the issue of energy and gender, the focus 
is mainly on improving the situation of women. 
Energy is needed for household uses, such as cooking, lighting, space heating 
and other appliances; for agricultural uses, such as tilling, irrigation and postharvest processing; and for rural industry uses, such as milling, mechanical 
energy, and process heat. Energy is also an input to water supply, 
communications, commerce, health, education and transportation in rural 
areas. Much of this energy is used and produced by women. 
Higher-income people generally use more-efficient and more-convenient 
sources of energy such as gas and electricity, while poor people use lessefficient and less-convenient sources such as wood fuel and human energy. 
Multiple fuel use is common at all income levels nonetheless, and the ‘fuel 
ladder’ is perhaps more accurately replaced by a ‘fuel pyramid’ of multiple 
fuels for different purposes and at different times. Poor people have fewer absolutely (paying higher unit prices) and relatively (as a percentage of their 
income) – than the non-poor do. Poor women nonetheless value multiple energy 
options highly and need them to help manage their daily work and time. 
The main use of inanimate energy in rural areas is for cooking and heating. 
Biomass is the primary fuel used, and it will continue to be so for the 
foreseeable future. The major source of energy in rural areas is human labour, 
which is used for both survival activities and production. This dependence on 
biomass and human energy is an important factor in rural poverty, and it is not 
measured either in national accounts or in energy balances. The role of women 
(and children) in this energy-use system is well known. The adverse effects of 
energy scarcity on poor women have been well documented. Health is a 
primary concern here. 
The presence of a large number of female-headed households in Zimbabwe, as 
well as women's primary responsibility for energy procurement and 
management (and the invisibility of these tasks in national energy accounts), 
give this ‘energy poverty’ a particular gender bias. The risk of poverty is 
greater for women, with 45 per cent of the households in Zimbabwe being 
female-headed.11
Neither public nor private energy infrastructure provisions are gender-neutral. 
Women use energy and electricity differently from men because of their 
different household and productive activities. For example, decisions about 
how or where electricity and electricity services (such as information and 
communication technology packages) are provided to households and 
communities influence women's ability to take advantage of these services. 
Women's micro-enterprises (an important factor in household income as well as 
in women's welfare and empowerment) are heat-intensive (food processing), 
labour-intensive and/or light-intensive (intensive home industries with work in 
evenings). A lack of adequate energy supplies - and other coordinated support –for these activities affects women's ability to operate these micro-enterprises 
profitably and safely. Conversely, the provision of affordable energy can be a 
key factor in enabling rural enterprises. The thrust is to mainstream gender 
issues into all energy-development issues in order to eliminate all negative 
economic, social and cultural practices that impede the equality and equity of 
the sexes. 
Although there are gender disparities in almost every context that need to be 
examined, they should be considered within the particular social, economic 
and political context. Since women throughout the world are not a 
homogeneous group, factors relating to culture, income, social class, religion, 
family status and geographical location also need to be incorporated into a 
more integrated view of energy as a factor in promoting social and economic 
development. 
9.7.2. Challenges 
 Limited awareness of gender issues in general in the society. 
 A small proportion of women enrol for energy-related educational 
programmes. 
 No synergy between gender interventions for the energy sector and the 
country’s overall agenda on gender issues. 
 Lack of participation by women in making energy choices. 
9.7.3. Policies 
 Ensure that the challenge of gender equality in the energy sector 
becomes a visible and key concern at the policy level. 
 Ensure that all energy interventions create opportunities for women’s 
empowerment and gender equality at the programme level. 
 Ensure that space and opportunities are available to women at the 
organizational level. 
 Encourage greater enrolment of women in energy-related disciplines. 9.7.4. Strategies 
Government will advocate capacity building to integrate a gender perspective 
into energy programmes at tertiary institutions and in policy and projects. 
The Ministry will identify a gender focal person to represent the Ministry, and 
who will direct and coordinate the implementation of gender mainstreaming in 
the energy sector, as well as ensure the systematic dissemination of energy and 
gender policies and awareness of energy issues in gender institutions. 
The Ministry will adopt gender-sensitive budgeting in energy-sector planning 
and programming, based on regional and international gender protocols and the 
National Gender Policy to ensure gender equality. 
For gender-sensitive energy development, Government will promote the 
acceleration of the representation of women at all levels and in all spheres of 
energy development and management activities. 
Government will adopt a gender-mainstreaming strategy in policy analysis, 
future project design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation 
activities. All new energy programmes and schemes will be subjected to a 
gender appraisal, so as to encourage gender sensitivity and women’s 
participation from the outset. This approach should entail gender analysis, the 
use of sex-disaggregated data and gender-sensitive indicators in project 
reporting and in monitoring and evaluation requirements. 
Government will expedite rural electrification programmes so that electricity 
can reach remote areas and ease the burden of rural women in sourcing 
energy.
