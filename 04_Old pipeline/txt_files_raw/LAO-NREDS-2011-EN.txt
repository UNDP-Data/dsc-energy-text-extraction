Section 1. Overview of Renewable Energy 
1.1. Introduction 
This strategy aims to develop new renewable energy resources which are not yet widely 
explored in Lao PDR to replace resources that will be exhausted in the future, also known as 
“non-renewable energy” (fossil fuels, coal, natural gas etc). These renewable energy resources 
comprise biomass energy (biofuels, biogas, ...); solar energy; wind; small hydropower. 
Energy is essential for meeting the peoples’ basic needs as well as vital in fuelling 
economic development. The increase in population and economic growth have resulted in 
increase of energy consumption. Reserves of non-renewable energy, being the dominant traded 
energy commodity, are declining. In particular, liquid fossil fuels are estimated to be depleted 
within the next few decades. Many countries in the world have recognized the importance of 
renewable energies, and therefore have undertaken technology research and development, and 
have set up goals for the development and effective use of their Renewable energy resources. 
1.2. Renewable energy development at the international level 
1.2.1. General overview 
As known, Fossil fuels are accumulated biomass since ancient past.. A huge amount of 
these fossil fuels had already been consumed in the 20th century. Furthermore, future extraction 
will be more challenging and more costly. With present fossil fuel use rate , all available 
reserves of petroleum and natural gas will be exploited within the 21st century (BP, 2003). 
Additional to exhaustibility of fossil, usage of fossil energy resources also creates 
harmful effects to to environment, particularly Green House Gas emission, which is the main 
cause for Global Climate changes. While, nuclear power shall not the right solution due to the 
limited reserve uranium in the world and security concerns from nuclear energy utilization . 
Recognizing the above mentioned challenges many countries have turned to 
reformulation of their energy strategy in order to be self sufficient and secured in energy supply. 
The first step is to promote the efficiency of energy usage from still available; and the second 
step, turn to development of inexhaustible and environmental friendly renewable energy 
resources. 
According to International Energy Agency (IEA), Total Primary energy consumption(1) 
worldwide in 2008 counted for 12,267 MTOE, share of renewable energy resources was 12.9% 
(Figure 1.3). Of the renewable energy shares, combustible biomass and wastes counted for 
10.0%, small change observed in hydropower 2.2% because hydropower development in 
developed countries has reached saturation and the slight increase is due to developing world. 
The use of Other renewable energies (such as wind, solar, geothermal energy, ...) rapidly 
increased from 0.1% in 2001 to 0.7% (2008), mainly solar and wind.

1.2.2. International Challenges 
Various external challenges exist which affect the promotion and the development of 
renewable energies, and these are: 
• Climate change due to the release of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; 
• Developing economies are transforming from agriculture to industrial based 
economies. This results in the growth of energy use as the manufacture of domestic 
products relies increasingly on industrial production; 
• Expansion of urbanization and modern cities shows change in energy consumption 
patterns; 
• Renewable energy developments are still dependent on foreign donors and investors; 
• Income generation and employment derived from renewable energy development are 
not very high. 
1.2.3. Trend of Renewable energy Development 
 In the reference Scenario, it was estimated that World's Total Primary Energy (TPES) 
Demand will grow with a rate of 45% between 2006-30, or about 1.6% per annum (Figure 1.3). 
Energy Intensity3
 decreases 1.7% per annum. Decrease of energy intensity is due to switching to 
market service oriented in many non-OECD and efficiency improvement in energy sector and 
energy consumption in OECD member’s countries. 
Hydropower has become important energy resource for power generation and such role 
will be unchanged in the reference scenario. While large hydropower resources of developed 
countries have already exploited, the large hydropower projects development will take place in 
non-OECD countries. Hydropower growth rate is around 1.9% per year and the share in TPES 
demand will remain 2%. By 2030 the share of hydropower in world total power generation will 
be 14%.

The use of combustible Biomass and waste will increase 1.4% per annum. This figure 
will be different by countries, depending on how these energy resources are used: the use of 
biomass for biofuels production and power generation will increase rapidly, but traditional 
biomass for cooking by low efficient stoves in poor households in developing countries will have 
slower increase. The use of Biomass and wastes for power generation in OECD will grow at a 
rate of 5.4% per annum from the low base. 
 
Figure 1.3 Trend of the world's TPES demand 1980-2030) (WEO IEA 2008) 
Other renewable, such as wind, solar, geothermal will increase most rapidly among all 
energy resources, with growth rate 7.2% per annum throughout this period. The share of other 
RE in power generation by 2030 will increase from 1% in 2006 to 4% in 2030. 
The changes in fuel compositions are also different by countries and regions. In OECD 
group, where increase of total demand is rather slow, Oil demand is slightly decrease, but the gas 
and renewable energies exclusive hydropower are the important part in such growth. Demand of 
Eastern Europe and Eurasia (including Russia) will increase by 336 Mtoe between 2006 and 
2030, of which about 60% is due to oil and gas consumption. China and India mainly still relay 
on coal. It is observed that energy demand in other countries of Asia and Latin America rather 
differ. Although coal demand is the most quickly growing, but Middle East countries still relay 
on Oil and Gas. Gas consumption in the region is counted for 26% of world's total. Biomass and 
wastes energy, and other energy resources is around 40% of total energy demand in Africa, 
mainly fuel wood, agriculture and forestry residues and charcoal for cooking and heating. 
Contrary, about 61% in biomass and other Renewable energy share excluding hydropower in 
OECD are in the form of modern technology, mainly wind. Biggest share in Biofuels production 
is in North and Latin America (Table 1.1).

South East Asian countries established targets for renewable energy development at 
around 20 percent of the total energy demand by 2025. 
At least, 83 countries (41 developed and 42 developing) have some type of policy to 
promote renewable power generation (REN21). The most common policy types are feed-in 
tariffs, renewable portfolio standards, capital subsidies or grants, investment tax credits, sales tax
or VAT exemptions, green certificate trading, direct energy production payments or tax credits, 
net metering, direct public investment or financing, and public competitive bidding. 
1.3. Renewable energy Development in Lao PDR 
1.3.1. Overview 
In 2009, the average fuel use in Lao PDR was 0.935 tons of TOE. Fuel consumption in 
Lao PDR however remains very low compared with other developing countries. Energy 
consumption in the country is mainly in the form of traditional fuels, i.e. the use of biomass such 
as fuel wood (56%) and charcoal (12%) for cooking and heating in rural areas. This represents 
around 69% of the total energy consumption (Figure1.4).

Figure1.5 Energy consumptions by sectors (MEM)
Lao population is around 6.7 million, average per capita GDP is 960 US$/year, The 
average domestic GDP growth rate is between 7.8% per annum (2006-2010). During the last five 
years, growth rate of industry reached 13-14% for 2006-2010. The economic growth rate 
between 7.5-8 percent during the sixth five-year plan has resulted in rising domestic energy 
consumption. At present, although economic growth has slowed down as a result of the 
international financial crisis, energy demand of the country continues to rise. On the consumer 
side, the demand of energy for transportation is high due to rapid increase of personal vehicle 
ownership. 
1.3.2. Potential of Renewable energy in Lao PDR 
Although Lao PDR lacks of conventional energy resources (e.g., Oil or Natural Gas) and 
has some reserve of coal, but there are abundant renewable energy resources, such as Biomass, 
hydropower, solar energy. In some part of the country there are some potential of wind and 
geothermal energy (appendix 1). 
Potential of biomass in Lao PDR includes energy crops and organic wastes. Energy crops 
comprise Oily crop (Palm, Jatropha, Vernicia Montana, Sun flower, Beans, coconut, etc), sugar 
and starch (sugarcane, Cassava, corn) and quick growing trees and aquatic cultures. Organic 
wastes include residues of agriculture-Forestry production, By-products of agro-forestry 
industry(sawdust, wood chips, rice husk, corn cobs, livestock manures...) and municipal wastes 
(Households' wastes, communal wastes, food processing wastes...). It was estimated that utilizing 
of livestock wastes for biogas production could generate around 2.8x108
 m3 of biogas per year, 
or equivalent to 5x108 kWh electricity (about 216 MTOE). 
Hydropower is the most important energy resources in Lao PDR, which technical 
potential was estimated around 26,000 MW, where yet counted small scale hydropower sites 
below 15 MW and estimated potential around 2000 MW. In the Lao PDR hydropower projects 
with capacity bellow 15 MW are classified as small-scale hydropower.

Solar irradiance on Lao PDR is between 3.6-5.5 kWh/m
2
, with sunshine 1800-2000 
hrs/year. With such solar energy potential, if photovoltaic technology was used (overall 
efficiency of 10%), it would generate 146 kWh/m2
/year, or 1.5x108 kWh/km2/year ( 13 
MTOE/km2/year). 
 There is lack of data on wind energy potential, particularly at a height above 50 m. 
According to international data sources, there maybe some wind potential in central provinces of 
Lao PDR, especially up of high mountains along Lao-Vietnam border (Savannakhet and 
Khammouane provinces) where at a height 50 m and above, wind speeds reach 5.8 m/s 4
. The 
theoretical potential for wind energy in Lao PDR is estimated to be more than 182,000 MW 
though the potential under very good and excellent wind regimes is relatively small at around 
2,800 MW. These resources are not ensuring due to lack of measurements. Wind resources are 
identified to be high in Khammouane and Savannaket provinces. At the present Ministry of 
Energy and Mines is ongoing installation wind data logger in four sites in these province and 
plan to install in other provinces. 
Lao PDR has rather low geothermal energy potential and currently not suitable for energy 
utilization. There some small geothermal resources in the form of hot spring only.
1.3.3. Status of Renewable energy development in Lao PDR 
In the past, fuel crops plantation for the production of biofuels had been initiated by 
private investors. These developments however were pilot and demonstration projects. The 
Government of Lao PDR has setup policy in order to promote biofuels production and use, 
particularly from jatropha and other appropriate energy feedstock. 
Installation of small solar home systems have been carried by public as well as private 
sectors, with funding from the World Bank, international organizations or own investment of 
local private companies. At present, around 20,000 households have been supplied electricity 
through solar home systems. Larger PV systems (capacity up to 40-100 kWp) have also been 
piloted within cooperation project between MEM and NEDO (Japan), as a component of a 
hybrid power system with micro hydropower in remote rural area. 
In addition, micro hydropower and pico hydropower have been developed to supply 
electric power to households in off-grid remote rural areas. Upto now, installed capacity of small 
scale hydropower projects (capacity less than 15 MW) have reached 23 MW. 
Biodiesel development from Jatropha, Vernicia Montana, Animal Fat, used tires and City 
wastes have been piloted by private sector. Fuel crops plantation for biofuels production has also 
progressed, especially Jatropha, Vernicia Montana, Palm, Sugarcane, Cassava plantation 
.Parallel to development of renewable energy resources, energy efficiency and energy 
conservation (EE&EC) issues have played more and more important role in energy sector of Lao 
PDR. In recent years, several pilot projects on EE&C have been carried out, such as Promotion 
of energy efficiency and energy conservation (PROMEEC) under cooperation program between 
ASEAN Center for Energy and Japan; Renewable energy and energy conservation under the 
framework of ACMECS program between Lao PDR and Thailand.

1.3.4. Renewable energy stakeholders 
 At present, there is no comprehensive renewable energy policy and strategy in Lao PDR. 
Projects implementations were carried out by various sectors which lead to gaps in the 
management and promotion of the development of renewable energies. Although there are some 
Private sector investments in fuel crops plantation, but facing significant obstacles due to lacking 
appropriate management mechanism 
In recent years, several public organizations and stakeholders have been involved in the 
development of renewable energy: 
• Ministry of Energy and Mines has been actively involved in various renewable 
energy activities, particularly in the development of solar energy, micro hydropower, 
bio-energy, and bio-fuel; 
• Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has been piloting project with small familyseized biogas digester and carried study on the plantation of fuel crops (Jatropha, and 
other); 
• Ministry of Science and Technology has carried out research projects on on 
renewable energy utilization in Lao PDR. 
Besides, other organizations and institutions, such as Universities, research institutes, 
Non-profit organizations, etc have also been involved in renewable energy research and 
development, namelyNational University of Laos, Organic Production Promotion Association, 
Agricultural and Handicraft Promotion Association, Plantation Promotion Association, Lao State 
Fuel Company, Kolao company, Sunlabob Renewable Energy Co., Ltd, Luangprabang Teak 
Tree Import-Export Co, Ltd (Kao Oil Tree Protection Promotion Plant and Development Project) 
and Bio-diesel Company. 
1.3.5. Renewable energy resources assessment 
 Based on existing data and in consultation with various stakeholders, it was clear that 
renewable energy potential assessment needed to be carried out. Several aspects are to be be 
considered:: 
• Improvement of Data collection in provincial level;
• Master plan for each renewable energy, such as Biomass, Wind and Other; 
• Recently drafted Rural electrification master plan provides clearer understanding 
about energy demand and supply in rural areas, particularly community small 
hydropower and solar power; 
• Study on Biofuels was completed by end of 2009, but no studies on feasibility and 
socio-economic impacts of land use for biofuels feedstock production were carried 
out; 
• Biomass information does not include those from the sugar industry, despite the fact 
that the annual production of sugar is around 750,000 tons; 
• The carried out studies were mainly concerned energy demand, demand growth rates, 
renewable energy potential, energy export plans and rural electrification, but the 12 
variety and appropriateness of technologies for the development of renewable energy 
have not yet been seriously considered. 
1.3.6. Domestic challenges 
Key challenges and constraints on the development of renewable energies in Lao PDR 
are as follows: 
• No specific policies or strategies on renewable energy promotion; 
• Lack of coordination between stakeholders in renewable energy projects; 
• Renewable energy policy has not yet been clearly stated in the National Socioeconomic Development Plans or in strategies on growth and poverty reduction, as 
well as five year plans of the government; 
• Lack of specific regulations and laws on renewable energies; 
• It was not clear yet, who responsible for approval of renewable energy projects; 
• Users have insufficient knowledge and understanding on renewable energies; 
• Lack of public funding support for the renewable energy sector, especially for 
research and development; 
• Absence of energy pricing regulation is a risk for investors; 
• Rural households prefer grid electricity rather than off-grid one; 
• Insufficient information on renewable energy potential for provincial level; 
• Electricity access rate in remote areas is still low due to high cost of grid extension. 
1.3.7. International Cooperation in renewable energy 
South-East Asia is abundant of natural resources. In particular renewable energy 
resources, such as hydropower, Biomass energy, solar energy, geothermal power, Wind power, 
etc. Therefore, there should be strengthened cooperation among ASEAN nations in order to 
secure energy self-sufficiency. SEAN member countries have agreed on construction of SEAN 
Power Network. Lao PDR would get benefit from this network by supplying power from its 
renewable resources, particularly hydropower. 
Natural conditions and geographical location of Lao PDR are favorable for development 
of renewable energy resources for domestic consumption and export. Lao government has had 
plans to development its abundant hydropower to meet needs of neighboring countries and 
domestic demand. 
1.3.8. Future trend of Renewable energy in Lao PDR 
The total domestic energy demand is anticipated to increase by 3.6 percent per annum, 
increasing from 1.8 million TOE in 2005 to 3.9 million TOE in 2025 (Figure1.6). Despite the 
fact that the overall demand of energy in various economic sectors will remain high until 2025, 
the share of household sector declines from 77.8 percent in 2005 to 48.5 percent in 2025. Energy 
demand in the industrial sector is increasing at around 8 percent per year or from 6.1 percent 
share to 16.9 percent during the period 2005 to 2025, while the transportation sector grows at 6.8 
percent per annum during that period. 13 
Electricity generation is predicted to increase at 11 percent annually for the period 2005 
to 2025. Most of produced electricity are for export to neighboring countries and only 10 
percent is used domestically. The domestic demand for electricity will increase from 425 
megawatts in 2006 to 2,863 megawatts in 2025. This increase will be covered mainly by 
development of hydropower and coal-fired power plants. 
The demand for transportation fuel is predicted to increase by 5 percent per year. By 
2025, the total demand for refined petroleum products will reach 1,174 million liters, of which 
45 percent is for gasoline (528 million liters) and 55 percent is for diesel (645 million liters). 
The available renewable energy resources in the country can meet some domestic 
demand. Table 1.2 illustrates the potential of renewable energy resources of Lao PDR, which 
may help achieving target of the government for the share of renewable energy up to 30% of 
energy consumption by the year 2025.

Section 2. Strategy and Policy 
2.1 Vision 
The Government of Lao PDR promotes the development of renewable energies as an 
important component of the national economic development to ensure energy security, sustain 
socio-economic development, and enhance environmental and social sustainability. 
2.2 Policies 
 The promotion and development of renewable energies is one of the priority policies of the 
Government to stabilize energy supply and to assist in the social and economic improvement of the 
country. 
 The Lao Government supports domestic and foreign entrepreneurs and investors to invest in 
energy projects at the village level. The development of renewable energy resources while 
responding to the needs of the local people contributes to the process of becoming self-sufficient in 
energy supply and for the development of energy exports. Renewable energy development involves 
participation of public and private sectors. 
 Policies on the promotion and development of renewable energies in Lao PDR focus on 
Small power development for self sufficiency and grid connection, biofuels production and 
marketing, and development of other clean energies in the country. The government defines 
priorities for development as follows: 
• Provide financial incentives to investors who aim to produce clean energies to meet domestic 
demand and, who take socially and environmental corporate responsibility in order to 
increase investments in renewable energy projects; 
• Formulate and improve laws and regulations to facilitate renewable energy development. 
 For electricity and energy development in rural areas, important aspects being considered are 
as follows: 
• Prioritization of policies which facilitate private sector investments in rural electrification 
such as provision of incentives and financing; 
• Development of small power systems, biofuels, solar and biomass energy at the village level 
to provide electricity and energy to rural and remote communities; 
• Generation of electricity for productive uses at the village level using waste materials from 
agriculture, biogas, hydropower or other local resources. People in rural areas will be 
encouraged to use renewable energy to enhance self-sufficiency and the GoL will seek 
cooperation with private sector, NGO and development partners to encourage investment 
support for processing equipment and necessary machinery adjustments. 
Integrated with national climate change strategy: Increase public awareness and 
understanding of climate change impacts and the need for mitigation and adaptation. 
2.3 Objectives 
The main objectives of this strategy are the following: 16
• To ensure adequate supply of energy, energy efficiency and conservation throughout the 
country and promote cultivation of fuel crops for the production of bio-fuels to replace 
imported fossil fuels; 
• To bring socio-economic benefits, including: 
o development of RE industry, contribution to national economic growth; 
o contribution to poverty reduction through improved livelihoods (income generation 
from RE production and employment opportunities inclusive of vulnerable groups to 
ensure decreased income disparities), and; 
o increased gender equality. 
• To ensure environmentally and socially sustainable development through enforcement of 
adequate safeguards to ensure: 
o local communities’ food security, and secure access to adequate land to meet and 
develop their livelihoods for all ethnic groups with special focus on women; 
o forest cover, biodiversity, agrobiodiveristy, and soil and water quality; 
o reduction of green-house gases through replacement of fossil fuels and control of 
negative land conversion impacts from climate change. 
2.4 Targets for 2025 
 The Government aims to increase the share of renewable energies to 30% of the total energy 
consumption in 2025. To reduce the importation of fossil fuels, the Government outlines a tentative 
vision to reach 10% of the total transport energy consumption from biofuels. This target will be 
regularly revisited and revised, feeding in results of special studies, lessons learned from on-going 
implementation, and international technological developments in the field of RE. 
2.5 Scope of Policy 
 The government policy is to promote investments in energy production from public and 
private sectors, and from local and foreign investors. The focus is on the development of the 
following: 
• Biofuels; 
• Small power 
• Other renewable energies such as solar, biomass, biogas and wind; 
• Other alternative fuels for transportation. 
2.6 Development Strategy 
 Lao PDR has experienced rapid economic growth since the past decade. During the past five 
years the economy grew between 7-8 per cent per year while the industrial growth rate has doubled 
and reached 14 percent in 2007. The success in the development of electricity and mines has helped 
spawn this rapid economic growth. 17
 This rapid economic growth has stimulated an increase in domestic energy consumption. In 
addition, the demand of energy for transportation is expected to continue to grow due to increase in 
personal vehicle ownership. 
 Lao government defines the strategy for development of each energy resource in the 
following subsections. 
2.6.1 Promotion and development of bio-fuels 
 Bio-energy provides an alternative fuel supply for the transportation sector and in the supply 
of energy to rural communities. Without domestic oil and gas resources, Lao PDR is completely 
dependent from external sources for its petroleum fuel requirements. The country imported 560 
million liters of fossil fuels in 2010, a significant increase 5 percent a year. With higher economic
growth prospects, oil imports are expected to high. This increases the country’s vulnerability to 
external supply disruptions and fuel price volatility, and the negative impacts to the country’s 
balance of payments. To reduce the importation of fossil fuels and optimize the use of marginal 
lands, the Government will encourage and actively promote development of fuel crops in the 
country with a preference for smallholder production under maintained community land ownership 
and control. 
 This strategy aims to kick-start the development of the biofuels market in the country 
through the provision of incentives to farmers, domestic and foreign investors to engage in the 
production of biofuels for domestic utilization and at the same time monitor its development and 
ensure proper mitigation of negative impacts. 
The tentative vision for the promotion and development of biofuels are the following: 
• Substitute 10% of the transportation fuel demand by 2025; 
• Increase deployment of biofuels technologies in rural areas. 
In meeting these targets, the Government will carry out the following: 
• Issue a Biofuels Decree which provides an overall legal framework for setting the targets; 
stipulates specific development goals; defines incentives, support and obligations of private 
investors including small-scale producers who are committed to produce exclusively for the 
domestic market; and establishes institutional arrangement for the promotion and 
development of biofuels. In the case of oversupply of biofuels, export will be allowed but no 
incentives or subsidies will be given to investors for the production for export; 
• Establish and strengthen the capacity of a body/agency responsible for the promotion and 
development of biofuels as well as in setting reference price for biofuels; 
• Formulate a Biofuels Action Plan (biodiesel and bio ethanol) as blueprint for development. 
The Plan specifies feedstock for biodiesel and bio ethanol production based on detailed 
feasibility studies, impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the alternative feed-stocks 
with special focus on biophysical land availability and socio-economic feasibility. Promote 
and support contract farming schemes, small-scale family-based biofuels feedstock 
production, and biofuels producer associations, while limiting the development of large-scale 
investor concessions and managed production concessions, and ensure adequate control of 
existing concessions. Establish partnership with current investors to ensure stable supply of 18
feedstock. Actively promote small-scale family-based production of fuel crops and establish 
model farms to enhance attractiveness of small-scale development; 
• In partnership with Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, establish a nationwide extension 
network to provide technical assistance to small-scale producers. Support research, 
demonstration and large-scale implementation of practices and interventions to increase fuel 
crop productivity and intercropping with food and commercial agriculture crops; 
• Provide support to research, demonstration and field testing of high yielding fuel crop 
varieties. Support research and field testing of second generation biofuels feedstock; 
• Provide financing to small scale producers and encourage local financing institutions to 
extend financing services to small-scale biofuels feedstock producers; 
• Support the establishment and development of nationwide marketing network for biofuels 
feedstock. Support farmers’ associations and local traders in marketing biofuels feedstock; 
• Establish partnership with industry players for the processing, production, blending and 
distribution of biofuels. Solicit support from the industry for initial demonstration of 
biofuels prior to large-scale implementation of biofuels targets. Introduce biofuels 
standardization. Carry out information campaign to raise consumer awareness concerning 
biofuels use; 
• Carry out research and demonstration of community use, farm machinery use and other rural 
applications of biofuels. Undertake information campaign to promote the utilization of 
biofuels technologies in rural areas. 
2.6.2 Promotion and development of small hydropower 
Hydropower resource is the most abundant energy resource in Lao PDR. The development 
of small hydropower (capacity up to 15 MW) could play an important role in meeting the country’s 
objectives of increasing rural electrification coverage from the current level of 70% to 90% in 2020. 
In addition, small hydropower development helps open avenues for economic improvement and 
poverty reduction in remote rural areas. Small hydropower provides least-cost power supply to 
remote areas which currently rely on imported electricity. Local small hydropower plants will also 
help improve the reliability of the country’s power system and reduce transmission and distribution 
line losses. 
 Lao PDR has substantial potential for small hydropower development which is estimated to 
be around 2,000 MW. The government intends to develop around 650 MW of small hydropower 
capacity between 2010 and 2025 by private and community. 
 In the past, Small hydropower development, were not sustainable due to natural disaster, lack 
of management, lack of technical and budget for maintenance.. To promote the development of 
small hydropower resources, the Government will implement measures to address the existing 
technical, financial, procedural and institutional barriers to small hydropower development in the 
country. 
• Carry out resource assessment and prepare small hydropower development plan. The 
Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) will carry out small hydropower resource assessment, 19
identify priority projects for development, and develop a small hydropower investment plan 
for each key river basin to optimize usage and benefits of water flow for power generation, 
irrigation, water supply as well as environmental and social protection. The plan also 
includes rehabilitation of old and inefficient small hydropower projects; 
• Introduce procedures for solicited and unsolicited small hydropower independent power 
producers (IPPs). Proposals for small hydropower projects at preselected sites will be 
solicited by MEM through competitive tender process. On the other hand, MEM also 
accepts unsolicited proposals from small hydropower project sponsors. For both solicited 
and unsolicited projects, MEM will establish transparent procedures in the submission, 
evaluation with special emphasis on environmental and social aspects and processing of 
projects as well as determination of off-take power tariffs and rules for grid interconnection 
and power dispatch; 
• Introduce simplified small hydropower development framework. The current framework 
governing small hydropower development is the existing legal framework for IPP 
procurement. To support the objectives of the Amended Electricity Law of 18 December 
2008 expediting the development of 5 MW or less small hydropower projects in Lao PDR, 
MEM will introduce simplified procedures for small hydropower project with capacity of 5 
MW or less. The simplified procedures however ensure that environmental and social 
safeguards are enforced, and that local communities are consulted and that they possibly 
participate as project shareholders. This includes exemption from the concession agreement 
requirement and negotiations will be carried out directly with provincial governments. On 
the other hand, the existing IPP framework and the above proposed procedures remain 
relevant for small hydropower projects with capacity between 5 MW and 15 MW; 
• Ensure grid access and promote third party sale of power. MEM will coordinate with 
Electricite du Laos to provide undiscriminatory access to small hydropower projects to 
transmission network and provide priority dispatch of all the power generated by gridconnected small hydropower projects. In addition, small hydropower producers will be 
allowed to sell the entire amount or part of the power generated directly to third party 
consumers; 
• Introduce legal framework for setting off-take tariff for small hydropower projects at an 
appropriate level ensuring investors to recover project costs and earn reasonable return on 
investments; 
• Establish framework and program to provide financing and guarantees to small hydropower 
projects. Encourage local financing institutions including state owned banks to provide 
loans and preferential financial packages. 
In addition to the above, pico hydropower technologies are relatively popular in remote 
villages in Lao PDR as source of power generation. The deployment of these technologies is mainly 
market driven. Presently, around 60 thousand units are installed all over the country supplying 
electricity services to about 90 thousand households. Though there is a declining trend on the use of
this technology due to increased rural electrification rate, pico hydropower is estimated to continue 20
to play an important role in the next decade. The use of this technology is however associated with 
technical and safety problems. To address these issues, the Government will carry out the 
following: 
• Raise public awareness on benefits and proper installation and use of pico hydropower; 
• Upscale best practice pilot projects and facilitate information exchange; 
• Coordinate with other relevant agencies on water utilization for pico-hydropower and other 
economic uses; 
• Setup supply-maintenance service chain and advisory service network; 
• Carry out regular training on installation design, installation and maintenance; 
• Provide support to local entrepreneurs to manufacture components of pico-hydropower. 
2.6.3 Promotion and development of solar energy 
 Solar energy is one of the abundant energy resources in Lao PDR. The country receives an 
average solar irradiation between 3.5 to 5 kWh/m2
/day. Solar energies can play an important role in
achieving government objectives to provide energy services to off-grid and remote areas, stimulate 
private sector investments, and improve energy efficiency in households and commercial buildings. 
 To encourage the use of solar energy in order to reduce consumption of other types of 
commercial energies and reduce environmental impacts, the Government promotes the development 
of solar energies in the following service areas: 
• Provide lighting services through the installation of solar home systems in rural and remote 
areas which do not have access to the national grid; 
• Support the development of the solar energy business in the country for the installation of 
large-scale grid connected solar energy systems and hybrid systems and for the provision of 
energy services in off-grid areas; 
• Promote the use of solar energy in water and space heating for households and commercial 
installations; 
• Promote the use of solar energy in productive uses such as drying agriculture produce, etc; 
• For the period 2010-2020, the Government under the Rural Electrification Master Plan 
(REMP) aims to upscale the program covering additional 19,000 households within 331 
villages in 11 provinces. 
 In addition, the Government also encourages the development of grid connected solar PV 
systems and solar PV hybrid systems, such as the integration with small hydropower and wind 
power, to sustain supply of electricity during the dry season. To promote the utilization of solar 
energy for these purposes, the Government will carry out the following: 
• Carry out resource assessment to determine the potential for off-grid hybrid systems, and 
building integrated and large scale grid connected solar PV systems; 
• Prepare a solar hybrid system program specifying appropriate service delivery schemes, 
business models, information and training programs;21
• Develop a framework to stimulate private sector investments on building integrated and 
large-scale grid connected solar PV projects; 
• Undertake pilot demonstration projects, information dissemination and training programs for 
both hybrid and grid-connected systems; 
• Promote up scaling of hybrid and grid connected solar PV projects. 
 In addition to power generation, the Government also promotes the use of solar energy for 
thermal applications for individual households, commercial buildings and industrial applications as 
well as for productive uses. 
• The Government will carry out market assessment and technical studies for solar water and 
space heating, and productive use of solar energy; 
• Prepare a national program for the promotion of solar water heaters and productive uses of 
solar energy specifying delivery framework and business models, information campaign and 
capacity building; 
• Carry out pilot demonstration projects, information dissemination and training programs 
targeting domestic, commercial and industrial applications. 
2.6.4 Promotion and development of biogas 
 Lao PDR imports liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for domestic and industrial utilization. 
LPG imports are relatively high amounting to 871,800 kg in 2006. LPG imports could be 
potentially reduced through the development of household and industrial scale biogas systems in the 
country. Significant potential exist in Lao PDR for biogas production from animal and livestock 
wastes, agro-industrial wastes, municipal solid wastes and waste water treatment plants. 
 A number of demonstration projects have been initiated and funded by several donor 
organizations for the development of household and community scale biogas systems using animal 
and livestock wastes. The Government aims to sustain these initiatives by up scaling and increasing 
the number of households using biogas by 50,000 in 2025 to reduce the importation of LPG, the use 
of firewood and charcoal, and the use of electricity for heating. To achieve this goal, the 
Government will carry out the following: 
• Designate and strengthen the capacity of an agency/organization responsible for up scaling 
household and community-based as well as medium and large scale biogas systems; 
• In partnership with private entrepreneurs and non-governmental organizations, carry out 
technical studies, identify the most appropriate business model and support mechanisms, and 
prepare a long-term program including monitoring plans for up scaling household biogas 
systems in Lao PDR; 
• Carry out information campaign and training programs for biogas system installation and 
utilization. Develop an accreditation scheme to certify installers; 
• Secure program financing, pilot test the new business model, and promote replication at the 
national level. 22
 The Government also promotes the development of large-scale biogas production for 
lighting, heating and electricity generation (either for project owner’s own use or for gridconnection) using several feedstock such as agro-industrial wastes, municipal solid wastes, waste 
water treatments, and others. Key activities to be undertaken by the Government include the 
following: 
• Carry out resource assessments and prepare a list of potential projects; 
• In consultation with stakeholders, prepare a framework to support private sector investments 
on medium and large-scale biogas systems, particularly those projects aiming for electricity 
generation for own use, third party sale or grid-connection; 
• Carry out demonstration projects, information campaign, capacity building and promote 
project replication; 
• Support research, development and demonstration for various applications of biogas in Lao 
PDR. 
2.6.5 Promotion and development of other biomass energies
 Being a predominantly agriculture-based economy, Lao PDR generates substantial amount of 
wastes from agriculture and forest production and processing such as sugarcane bagasse, rice husks, 
corn cobs, wood wastes, etc. Also, with growing urbanization, main cities are also generating 
significant amount of solid wastes. At present, there is no large-scale exploitation of these resources 
for energy generation. In addition, community forests could also be sustainably developed to supply 
fuel for energy generation. These resources could potentially generate power for productive uses 
and other modern energy services in both urban and rural areas, either for off-grid or grid connected 
systems. The Government recognizes the use of these agricultural and municipal solid wastes to 
form part of the overall energy mix to ensure energy security of the country. 
In promoting biomass energy for electricity generation, the Government will undertake the 
following: 
• Carry out biomass resource assessment and prepare a list of priority projects; 
• Formulate a framework to stimulate private sector investments in power generation from 
various sources of biomass; 
• Carry out pilot demonstration to test the framework developed and at the same time to 
demonstrate the technical viability of a specific biomass-based technology in the country; 
• Undertake information dissemination and training programs; 
• Develop biomass technology-based independent power producers (for both grid and off-grid 
power supply). 
 In addition to power generation, biomass fuels such as wood and charcoal are mainly used in 
rural and urban areas for cooking. Biomass cooking fuels are estimated to represent around 70 
percent of the total energy consumption in Lao PDR. The high dependence on biomass energies for 
cooking has major implications with respect to environmental degradation, higher time spent in 
wood fuel collection, and indoor air pollution which threatens the well-being of the most vulnerable 23
household members. To address this issue the Government promotes the development and market 
deployment of the most efficient and appropriate cooking stoves in the country. 
• Carry out market assessment and technical studies for improved cooking stoves (ICS) in Lao 
PDR; 
• Prepare a program on ICS which include service delivery framework and appropriate 
business model, technology design, technology standardization and labelling, information 
campaign, national capacity building on design and manufacture of technologies; 
• Identify projects for pilot demonstration and prepare feasibility studies; 
• Implement demonstration projects, carry out information campaign and undertake training 
programs; 
• Upscale improved cook stove program. 
2.6.6 Promotion and development of wind energy 
 Based on the existing data, Wind energy can be potentially developed for large-scale gridconnected power generation and for hybrid systems providing energy services to rural and remote 
villages. The Government aims to develop around 50 MW of wind power by 2025. To promote the 
development of wind energy in the country, the Government will undertake the following: 
• Expand the current wind measurement campaign and upgrade the current wind atlas using 
ground measurement data; 
• Identify potential sites for grid-connected and off-grid hybrid systems and priority sites for 
possible wind energy concessions; 
• In partnership with international financial and donor organizations, carry out demonstration 
projects for grid-connected as well as hybrid wind energy systems; 
• Prepare wind concession framework, and electricity market access framework including 
incentives framework to stimulate private investments in wind power in Lao PDR; 
• With the support and cooperation from donor governments and international organizations, 
carry out information campaign and build national capacity on wind energy power 
generation. 
2.6.7 Promotion and development of other alternative energy sources for Transport 
 The government promotes and encourages domestic and foreign, public and private sectors, 
to invest in research, development and demonstration as well as in feasibility studies of other 
alternative energy technologies and sources for transportation sector. 
More specifically, the Government will undertake the following: 
• Facilitate coordination among responsible agencies concerning urban transport development 
and possible utilization of alternative transport technologies and fuels; 24
• Support research and development and carry out feasibility studies and demonstration 
projects for alternative technologies and fuels for urban transport such as electricity, fuel 
cells and hydrogen; 
• Upscale the current demonstration projects concerning the use of biofuels in rural transport 
and farm machineries; 
• Carry out studies and demonstration projects for the use of higher blend biofuels for freight 
transport; 
• Based on the technical studies and demonstration projects, develop a long-tern program for 
sustainable transportation system in Lao PDR. 
2.7 Financial mechanisms 
2.7.1 Participation of the private sector 
 The private sector is permitted to invest in the following projects: 
• Small power production (SPPs) projects with non-firm contract (the project is paid only for 
energy production); 
• Grid connected renewable energy project with non-firm contract (for own use and sale to 
EDL for surplus production); 
• Grid connected renewable energy project with firm contract (project is paid for capacity 
provision and energy production); 
• Off-grid projects; 
• Activities in bio-energy, biogas or bio-fuel production such as fuel crops plantation, 
construction of processing plant and bio-fuel production and blending. 
2.7.2 Financial incentives 
 Financial related barriers to renewable energy development in Lao PDR are high upfront 
investment requirement and lack of available find for renewable energy projects. The Government 
will provide financial incentives and financing assistance to renewable energy projects and 
investors. 
Financial Incentives 
 Investments in renewable energy projects in Lao PDR, whether on biofuels production, gridconnected or isolated systems, off-grid projects, and individual systems, are entitled to investment 
incentives under the Investment Law of Lao PDR, update in 2009. The financial incentives include 
the following: 
• Import duty free on production machinery, equipment and raw materials; 
• Import duty free on chemical materials necessary for biofuels production within 7 years; 
• Profit tax is divided in to 3 categories: 20%, 15% and 10%. Profit tax exemption is possible 
for a certain period depending on activities, investment areas and size investment; 25
• Subsidies on unit product price depending on energy type and times period. 
Additionally, the investors can obtain also non-fiscal incentives, such as: 
• Up to 75 years leasing term (for enterprise construction land); 
• Permission to expatriate earnings to home or third countries; 
• Right to employ foreign workforce (not more that 10% of the enterprise’s total labors). 
Financial mechanism 
The Government will provide support by seeking assistance from international organizations, 
commercial banks and low interest loans sources for funding renewable energy projects; to 
encourage private commercial banks in understanding and interests to investment into renewable 
energy projects. 
Besides, the government shall issue the investment guidelines and development roadmaps to 
attract internal and foreign investments in renewable energies. The Government will establish a 
one-stop service centre for disseminating information and facilitate investments on renewable 
energies. 
2.7.3 Renewable Energy Fund 
 To harmonize the support to renewable energies in Lao PDR, the Government will establish 
a Renewable Energy (REN) Fund as sub-account to the existing Rural Electrification (RE) Fund. 
The Fund will be used for the following: 
• Financial assistance for the development of renewable energy and biofuel industry and 
market in Lao PDR; 
• Finance barrier removal activities such as resource assessment; research, development, and 
demonstration activities; project preparatory studies, etc; 
• Fund capacity building activities, promotional activities, dissemination of knowledge on 
effective renewable energy use, etc. 
The Fund will be sourced from the following: 
• Government budget; 
• International organizations and donor countries, international financial organizations and 
NGOs; 
• Financial contribution or investment from social organizations and from domestic and 
foreign investors. 
Though the REN Fund is a sub-account of the RE Fund, the Government ensures that there is 
a clear separation between the two accounts. The existing management of the RE Fund will also 
manage the REN Fund whose functions are the following: 
• account, control and disburse funds; 
• monitor loans and grants. 
The Government will establish a Steering Committee who will be responsible for making 
decisions on the use of funds with MEM acting its Secretariat. Each Province will be represented in 
the Steering Committee to ensure development of renewable energy markets in the provinces. 26
2.7.4 Carbon Financing 
The Government recognizes carbon financing as one of the measures to improve renewable 
energy project profitability in Lao PDR. The emissions reductions that could be generated by these 
projects could be traded in the global carbon markets. 
The certified emission reduction (CER) market of the Clean Development Mechanism 
(CDM) is one of the global carbon markets that can be accessed by renewable energy project 
developers. CDM is one of the flexible mechanisms established under the Kyoto Protocol of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to assist industrialized 
countries in meeting their emissions reduction obligations at lower cost and at the same time to 
stimulate investments that promote sustainable development in developing countries. 
Lao PDR satisfied the participation requirements for CDM. The government ratified the 
Kyoto Protocol in 2004, appointed Water Resources and Environmental Administration (WREA) to 
be the Designated National Authority, developed sustainable development criteria, and established 
the approval processes for CDM projects. With recent progress in CDM, the Government ensures 
that small-scale projects such as solar homes systems, pico hydropower, biogas, improved cook 
stoves, solar water heaters, etc will be developed under the CDM Program of Activities or 
programmatic CDM. 
In addition to CDM, the Government also encourages project proponents to access other 
carbon markets such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme where CDM CERs can be converted into 
EU allowance units, and to voluntary markets in Europe and North America that purchase verified 
emissions reductions for clean energy projects. 
2.8 Renewable Energy Road Maps 
In constructing the renewable energy road maps, timelines and milestones were defined for 
the proposed policy, legal, financial, market and organizational interventions for each renewable 
energy type to meet the national target and specific renewable energy targets for 2025. Road maps 
for the following renewable energies are given in the Annex. 
• Biodiesel; 
• Bio ethanol; 
• Small hydropower; 
• Solar energy; 
• Biogas; 
• Biomass; 
• Wind energy; 
• Other alternative sources of energy for transport. 
2.9 Estimated Investment Cost for Renewable Energy Sector 
To fulfill the goals of renewable energy sector development, the government encourages 
investments from public and private sectors. 27
The government will facilitate and provide appropriate incentives and risk guarantee for 
investments in the renewable energy sector. Investments in 2025 is projected to reach around USD 
1,799 million , of which USD 17 million is from the public sector, USD 36 million from domestic 
investors and USD 1746 million from foreign investors (see table 2.1):

agencies concern are illustrate in annex 3. 
3.2. Driving measures to kick-start short term implementation 
• Public sector. Prepare a list and documents for projects located in rural and remote areas, 
which have high demand for energy but not economically variable, especially in the 
Northern provinces. These projects will be implemented if there is public funding and/or 
people/NGOs/donors contribution (such as small hydropower in northern part of Lao PDR, 
solar home systems for villages and wind energy in central and southern provinces); 
• Private sector. Support will be provided for the implementation of commercially viable 
projects.

• Capacity building on renewable energy for the line agency concern. 
3.3 Important factors for successful implementation 
• Define renewable energy into national agenda. 
Renewable Energy policies and strategies must be integrated into socio-economic 
development plan of the government: 
o Government socio-economic development strategy until 2020; 
o Industrialization and modernization strategy; 
o The seventh five-year socio-economic development programs 2010-2015; 
o National growth and poverty eradication strategy; 
o Sector and sub-sector strategic plans; 
o Consider national and international development framework. 
• The government has policies to support renewable energy, especially financial measures 
which include: 
o Policies on subsidizing tariffs bought from energy until 2015, especially the revision of 
the tariff rate, in reference to appropriate technological and economic conditions; 
o Policies on funding for investment promotion and risk warranty, especially small 
industry; 
o Policies on the supply of investment capital to assist in initial investment on renewable 
energy, including low interest loans for the investment in the production of renewable 
energy; 
o The government is responsible for basic infrastructures to accommodate the expansion of 
renewable energy such as: transmission line systems and warehouses for storing bio-fuel 
o Improve law and regulations related to renewable energy; 
o Budget for related sector to be used for studies, research and development, promotion, 
mobilization, dissemination of renewable energy technology; 
o Access to information on renewable energy such as potentials of solar power, wind 
energy, hydropower and sources of raw materials; 
o Establish renewable energy technology standards. 
All related sectors should increase cooperation in the implementation of this strategy on the 
development of renewable energy. Policies and instruments presented in this strategy are improved 
to fit with goals of the policy in order to attract investors. This strategy consists of three 
components; the increase in financial support, strengthened legal framework and enhanced 
coordination between public organizations and institutes. 32
Annex 1: Potential of Renewable Energy Resources 
Types of 
renewable 
energy 
Potential Status in 2009 
Hydropower Potential for the development of hydropower, 
excluding potential sites along Mekong River, is 
26,500 MW. There has not been detailed 
feasibility studies or surveys on small hydropower 
under 5 MW 
The current total capacity of small hydropower is 
11.5 MW with 22.5 MW more under construction, 
contracted with EdL. Furthermore, over 100 MW 
are under feasibility studies by the private sector. 
At present, ADB is funding a feasibility study of 
the hydropower potential under 5 MW
Solar power Lao PDR has 300 days of sun light per year. The 
potential capacity of solar energy is 4.5-5 
KWh/m2
/day. Laos has the good locations for 
solar power, particularly in the southern parts 
Solar power plays a large role in rural 
electrification. 25,000 households have been 
supplied with solar home systems. There are 
private companies and individuals who have been 
operating solar supply and installation business. 
1% of total installations are used for business 
purposes
Biomass Lao PDR is an agricultural based country. There 
are a lots of wastes generated every year from 
agro-forestry production, such as rice straws/husk,
sawdust, corn cobs, livestock manures, which can 
be used as feedstock for energy generation. 
Besides, communal and organic industrial wastes 
are among the important biomass energy 
resources. Annual Energy Potential of Agroforestry wastes is estimated around 500 MTOE. 
There is also high potential of energy crops in Lao
PDR, such as oily crops (jatropha, Vernicia 
Montana nut, oil palm, soybean, etc), starch 
culture (cassava, corn,) sugar (sugarcane) and 
other trees, which can be used as feedstock for 
biofuels production. 
Furthermore, variety of quick growing trees or 
aquatic cultures can also play an important role in
rural energy production and processing industry. 
Surveyed data show that around 90% of Lao 
population still relay on biomass energy for 
cooking, and small rural industrial needs (such as 
masonry production, tobacco processing, alcohol 
production and so on). There was attempt to pilot 
small scale gasification power production. 
In recent years, there have been conducted pilot 
projects on jatropha plantation for biodiesel 
production. Kolao farm has invested on Jatropha 
plantation on 2500 ha and pressing factory with 
capacity 40 ton per day, and biodiesel processing 
factory - capacity 2000 L/day in Kenthao district, 
Xayabouly province. 
Besides, a teak wood company in Luang Prabang 
has piloted plantation of Vernicia Montana nut on 
area of 7000 ha. 
SNV together with Ministry of Agriculture and 
Forestry has successfully piloted small project on 
promotion of family size biogas digesters. The 
government supports follow up projects. 
Obviously to say, there is still lack of data on 
biomass resources in Lao PDR. 
Wind power In general, there lack of data on wind potential in 
Lao PDR, especially on height above 10 m. Based 
on international data sources, it was estimated that 
there are high wind potential in central provinces,
particularly at high mountainous areas along the 
Lao-Vietnam border of provices Khammouane 
and Savannakhet. At a height more than 50 m, 
average wind speed reaches 5.8 m/s, which 
appropriate for power generation. 
MEM recently has installed wind data lodger in 
central Savannakhet province. 
Geothermal 
energy 
In general, Lao PDR has relatively low potential 
of geothermal energy. Observed geothermal 
resources in some provinces are low temperature 
one, not more than 70oC. 
Currently, hot spring sites have used as the tourist 
destinations. 33
