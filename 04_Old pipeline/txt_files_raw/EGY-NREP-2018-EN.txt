Energy Outlook
EGYPT Egypt’s Vision 2030 aims to achieve a diversified, competitive and balanced economy within 
the framework of sustainable development. Renewable energy has a central role to play, a role 
detailed in the Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy to 2035, released by the Ministry of 
Electricity and Renewable Energy in 2015. 
The “ISES 2035” ensures continuous, diversified energy security and establishes the necessary 
conditions to enable the increased development of renewables through the engagement of all 
sectors. Moreover, the strategy confirms Egypt’s ambition to become an energy hub between 
Europe, Asia and Africa by expanding grid interconnections across the Arab region and beyond. 
Egypt is home to a wide array of untapped solar and wind resources, and according to the ISES 
2035, renewable energy capacity should contribute 42% of power capacity by 2035. 
The Renewables Readiness Assessment and REmap country analysis – which together form this 
Renewable Energy Outlook study – will help Egypt to achieve such targets. These analyses suggest 
how to build on the initiatives that Egypt has already undertaken to enhance the deployment 
of renewable energy technologies. The Egyptian electricity sector, for example, has adopted a 
localisation programme and succeeded in meeting a 30% local content target for overall wind 
farm requirements, with the aim of increasing that to 70% by 2020. Concentrated solar power 
(CSP) plants should have 50% local content by the same year. 
FOREWORD
from the Minister
of Electricity and
Renewable EnergyThis analysis was conducted through close collaboration between the Ministry of Electricity and 
Renewable Energy and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), with support from 
the New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA). It provides vital information to stakeholders 
in the field of renewable energy, including both governmental and private-sector entities. 
This report demonstrates the ability of Egypt to maintain economic growth, sustainability and 
energy security. It shows how to ensure private-sector engagement, defines the main policy, 
institutional, market and skills challenges, and offers recommended actions to overcome those 
challenges. 
On behalf of the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, I would like to express my sincerest 
appreciation for IRENA’s efforts and support in advancing renewable energy deployment in 
Egypt. I would also like to thank all the personnel involved in this project for their excellent cooperation and contributions. I am certain that this report will play a vital role in Egypt’s current 
strategy to achieve its goals in promoting renewable energy. 
H.E. Dr Mohamed Shaker
Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy
Arab Republic of EgyptAs the most populous country in the Middle East, Egypt faces rising energy demand driven 
by rapid population growth and an expanding economy. This creates significant challenges in 
maintaining a steady and continuous supply of energy. Renewable energy can help Egypt not 
only meet its energy needs, but also power sustainable economic growth and create jobs while 
achieving global climate and sustainable development objectives. 
The government has recognised this opportunity in its Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy, 
or ISES 2035, which seeks to ensure energy security, stability and sustainability through the 
widespread adoption of renewable energy technologies. Major renewable energy projects are 
now under development, reflecting the government’s resolve to turn this vision into reality. Several 
recent tenders have attracted strong international interest and promising proposals, which could 
further help ramp up renewable power generation in the coming years. The government’s latest 
targets call for 20% of Egypt’s power generation to be based on renewables by 2022, and 42% 
by 2035.
Renewable Energy Outlook: Egypt highlights the policy, regulatory, financial and capacity-buildingrelated actions needed to meet and even surpass these targets. Prepared by the International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in collaboration with Egypt’s New and Renewable Energy 
Authority (NREA), this report identifies key challenges and opportunities for the country to 
expand the use of renewable energy.
The report combines two IRENA methodologies: the Renewables Readiness Assessment based on 
country-led stakeholder consultations; and REmap, IRENA’s ongoing series of renewable energy 
roadmaps that analyse the different technology pathways to maximise a country’s renewables 
potential in the long term.
FOREWORD
from the IRENA
Director-GeneralBy adopting the right policies now, Egypt could realistically draw 53% of its electricity from 
renewables by 2030. This higher uptake of renewable power, when combined with renewables 
used for heat and transport, would end up reducing total costs, including energy, environmental 
and health-related costs by USD 9 billion per year on average compared to current energy plans.
Moreover, Egypt has a significant comparative advantage through its manufacturing potential 
in different segments of the renewables value chain. Enhancing local manufacturing capabilities 
could unlock significant socio-economic benefits, particularly in terms of job creation. 
I would like to thank H.E. Dr Mohamed Shaker El-Markabi, Minister of Electricity and Renewable 
Energy, for his strong support, as well as NREA for its invaluable input. We are also grateful for 
the important contributions made by various other stakeholders and international partners. 
The energy choices that Egypt makes today are likely to resonate far beyond its borders. We 
sincerely hope that this report will help to accelerate Egypt’s transition to a sustainable energy 
future, and we look forward to working with the Egyptian government in taking forward its 
recommendations.

SUMMARYThe Arab Republic of Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa and 
the Arab region and home to one of the fastest-growing populations globally. 
The rapidly swelling number of inhabitants has led to a rapid increase in energy 
demand, putting a strain on the country’s domestic energy resources even amid 
substantial recent offshore natural gas finds. As fuel shortages heightened in 
2014, the country’s electricity generating capacity struggled to keep pace with 
rising energy demand.
Egypt’s economic development hinges on the energy sector, which represents 
13.1% of overall gross domestic product (GDP). To meet burgeoning energy 
demand, the Egyptian government has pursued an energy diversification 
strategy, known as the Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy (ISES) to 2035, to 
ensure the continuous security and stability of the country’s energy supply. This 
strategy involves stepping up the development of renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, in part through vigorous rehabilitation and maintenance programmes 
in the power sector.
Egypt is, therefore, committed to the widespread deployment of renewable 
energy technologies. To date, the country’s total installed capacity of renewables 
amounts to 3.7 gigawatts (GW), including 2.8 GW of hydropower and around 
0.9 GW of solar and wind power. As specified in the ISES to 2035, the Egyptian 
government has set renewable energy targets of 20% of the electricity mix by 
2022 and 42% by 2035.Egypt has ample potential to achieve these 
ambitious targets, as it enjoys an abundance of 
renewable energy resources with high deployment 
potential, including hydropower, wind, solar and 
biomass. The establishment of the New and 
Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) in 1986 was an 
important milestone in Egypt’s efforts to enhance 
renewable energy deployment. While the NREA 
focuses particularly on wind and solar technologies, 
other institutions have devoted efforts to biomass 
development. Among those institutions are the 
state-owned electricity generation, transmission 
and distribution entities operated under the 
supervision of the Egyptian Electricity Holding 
Company (EEHC).
This study by the International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA) provides an in-depth assessment 
of the policy, regulatory, financial and capacity 
readiness challenges that need to be overcome to 
achieve the targets set out in the ISES to 2035. In 
this respect, it follows the Renewables Readiness 
Assessment (RRA) methodology, whereby IRENA 
facilitates country-led consultations with multiple 
stakeholders, aiming to identify key challenges 
and highlight solutions to boost renewable energy 
deployment. It also provides an in-depth analysis 
based on IRENA’s REmap analysis approach, 
identifying additional renewable energy potential 
and quantifying other factors, such as costs, 
investment needs and the effect on externalities 
related to air pollution and the environment.
Based on this REmap analysis, Egypt has the 
potential to supply 53% of its electricity mix from 
renewables by 2030. This amounts to doubling the 
renewable energy share that could be expected 
from pursuing existing plans and policies (known 
in this study as the Reference Case) as well as a 
significant rise compared to the 9% recorded in 2014 
(the base year of the analysis). This assessment is 
in line with the results obtained for Scenario 3 of 
the ISES to 2035. With renewable power, heat and 
fuels all factored in, the REmap analysis shows that 
renewable energy could provide 22% of Egypt’s 
total final energy supply in 2030, up from just 5% 
overall in 2014.
Renewable energy could provide 
22% of Egypt’s energy supply in 2030
The REmap analysis also finds that due to declining 
costs for renewable power technologies, their 
increased deployment results in a reduction in 
total energy costs of USD 900 million annually in 
2030, equivalent to a cost reduction of USD 7 per 
megawatt hour (MWh). This is the case even before 
taking into account the reductions in external costs 
from air pollution, which would bring broad social 
and health benefits worth as much as USD 4.7 
billion annually in 2030. Investment in renewable 
energy capacity over the period would have to 
be raised, from USD 2.5 billion per year based on 
existing policies (the Reference Case) to USD 6.5 
billion per year with accelerated deployment of 
renewables (the REmap Case).
Strategies and plans must be 
updated regularly to reflect
new developments
However, the successful realisation of such 
deployment would require significant adjustments 
to Egypt’s sustainable energy strategy. The present 
strategy, developed in 2014, does not reflect the 
rapid economic and technological changes taking 
place at the national and regional levels. Moreover, 
plans need to factor in the latest data to account 
for the cost of externalities, particularly with 
Egypt’s highly subsidised energy prices. Eliminating 
such subsidies would relieve the government of a 
heavy financial burden, which has been a strain 
amid diminishing state revenues. For Egypt to 
capture the complete benefits of renewables, the 
government must consider both financial and 
technical challenges.
This study attempts to identify those challenges 
and highlight key actions to overcome existing 
limitations. Based on these recommended actions, 
Egypt can meet, and in due course exceed, the 
targets identified in its sustainable energy strategy.Challenges and recommended actions
• Update energy and power sector strategies to 
reflect the growing cost advantages and other 
benefits of renewables: Egypt’s sustainable 
energy strategy, ISES to 2035, is based on the 
least-cost approach, whereby energy subsidies 
are eliminated by 2022 and different energy 
sources would be able to compete within a 
free and fair market structure. The strategy 
developed in 2014 envisages a total share of 16% 
for coal, 3.3% for nuclear energy and 42% for 
renewable energy in the installed capacity mix 
by 2035.
The main driver for the introduction of coal 
in Egypt’s energy mix was a result of the 2014 
electricity shortages, with imported coal providing 
a rapid solution to reduce the dependency on 
imported gas. Today, the approach is subject 
to drastic change following falling costs for 
renewables, coupled with the recent natural gas 
discoveries and rising environmental concerns 
over coal generation.
Towards this objective, energy and power sector 
strategies and plans must be updated regularly 
to reflect new developments, which permit a 
share of renewables in power generation as high 
as 53% to be achieved by 2030. This would also 
reduce and even eliminate the need for coal 
and nuclear-related imports, thus strengthening 
the country’s energy security. The overall costcompetitiveness and ease of access to finance 
for renewables, particularly in comparison to 
the strenuous planning processes required for 
nuclear technology, could be reflected in future 
strategy updates.
• Reflect the potential of biomass in future updates 
of the energy strategy: While the regulatory 
framework addresses electricity production 
systems using wind and solar, the strategy has 
not given sufficient focus to the exploitation of 
biomass potential. This is evident in the limited 
progress achieved on biomass mainly due to 
the shortage of local capacity, along with the 
considerable upfront costs associated with 
biomass-based electricity generation.
Feasibility studies are necessary to assess the 
potential for developing a strong regulatory 
framework to enable appropriate policy support 
schemes. Furthermore, the application of 
biomass is limited by low awareness of the range 
of renewable energy technologies available 
to the end-use sectors. Therefore, the NREA 
is advised to develop an awareness-raising 
programme that includes publicity campaigns, 
along with education and training programmes, 
to ensure that all the benefits of renewable 
energy are realised.
• Streamline regulations and clarify institutional 
roles and responsibilities for wind and solar 
development: Wind and solar deployment 
is supported through laws, regulations 
and implementation schemes. Despite the 
enabling environment to encourage privatesector participation, project developers 
are discouraged by complex administrative 
procedures, including the unavailability of 
contractual documents for projects and multiple 
focal points for renewable energy deployment. 
To overcome these challenges, institutional roles 
ought to be further defined.
This can be achieved by establishing the 
NREA as the national renewable energy co 
ordinator throughout the project lifetime, thus 
empowering the NREA as a “one-stop shop” to 
expedite processes under any renewable energy 
development scheme, enhancing both the 
private-sector contribution to renewable energy 
deployment and reinforcing its role as a facilitator 
rather than a project developer. In turn, this 
would allow for the clear definition of institutional 
responsibilities and prevent the overlap of roles 
under different procurement and market schemes.
Investment in renewable energy 
capacity, currently set at around 
USD 2.5 billion per year until 2030, 
needs to increase further The NREA has so far been given precedence as 
a developer, based on its current entitlement to 
land ownership for renewable energy projects, 
while also being the recipient of most of the soft 
loans attributed to these projects.
• Reform the current market framework to 
improve project bankability: Under the New 
Electricity Law of July 2015, direct contractual 
relations between suppliers and end users can 
exist, confirming the transition of the Egyptian 
Electricity Transmission Company (EETC), 
state-owned off-taker, to a conductor of 
system operations and dispatching procedures. 
With respect to the implementation of power 
purchase agreements (PPAs), EETC has faced 
difficulties addressing its financial obligations 
and securing bankable PPAs. This highlights the 
need to review the current terms and conditions 
of renewable energy PPAs to address concerns 
raised by investors, including putting in place 
standardised project document templates for 
renewable energy projects.
• Bundle renewable energy projects to strengthen 
risk mitigation and ensure their financial 
viability: Currently, local financial institutions do 
not perceive renewables as low-risk investments, 
despite their cost-competitiveness. The 
determining factor for renewables is the scale 
of the projects, such that smaller renewable 
energy projects are subject to high interest rates 
from local financial institutions, while larger 
renewable energy projects are able to obtain 
lower interest rates from institutions based 
outside Egypt, with a trade-off in currency 
exchange rate fluctuations.
Smaller-sized renewable energy projects, 
however, can be bundled to achieve the required 
scale, reduce transaction costs and bolster local 
financial institutions’ confidence in projects. 
In turn, enhanced confidence would allow 
the domestic financial community to develop 
lending schemes tailored towards renewable 
energy projects using concessional resources, 
allowing renewable energy projects to flourish.
• Carry out comprehensive measurement 
campaigns for solar and wind potential:
Several wind and solar resource assessments 
have been conducted; however, they have not 
been supplemented with sufficient detail to 
ensure bankability of projects. The ISES to 
2035 includes 52 GW of both large-scale and 
distributed on-grid renewable energy by 2035. 
The REmap analysis shows that already by 
2030 similar on-grid renewable capacity could
exceed 62 GW.
This necessitates zoning of cost-effective areas 
with a high potential for renewable energy, while 
aligning all grid operation and dispatch practices 
to accommodate the variability in supply that 
could be expected to follow large-scale solar and 
wind investments. The measurement campaigns, 
entailing site appraisal, could be conducted by 
the developer, thus reducing the burden on the 
NREA, which currently has the responsibility for 
resource assessment. In this context, a greater 
role for variable renewable energy sources will 
require from NREA to identify viable options 
for improved power system flexibility, including 
strengthening cross-border interconnections.
• Develop a master plan for enhancing local 
manufacturing capabilities and create a vibrant 
domestic renewable energy industry: The 
ISES to 2035 does not tackle the potential for 
renewable energy equipment manufacturing and 
related service sector development. Integrating 
local content requirements into renewable 
energy procurement processes is challenging. 
Most international finance institutions, who 
are the main funders of large-scale renewable 
energy projects, are reluctant to accept them on 
competition grounds.
Smaller renewable energy projects 
can be bundled to achieve scale, 
reduce transaction costs and bolster 
the confidence of banks The current phase of renewable energy 
deployment has provided 6 000 direct and 
indirect jobs in total, with solar photovoltaic 
alone providing half of the jobs created. The 
government, therefore, is advised to elaborate 
a national master plan for the development of 
local manufacturing capabilities, specifically in 
order to promote knowledge and technology 
transfer, thus creating local jobs.
Nevertheless, studies completed by IRENA 
highlight Egypt’s comparative advantage 
in different segments of the renewables 
value chain, particularly in the downstream 
segments of project development, operation 
and maintenance. Leveraging this potential 
to increase the share of local content in 
manufacturing would facilitate an array of socioeconomic benefits.
• Update energy and power sector strategies to reflect the growing cost 
advantages and other benefits of renewables 
• Reflect the potential of biomass in future updates of the energy strategy 
• Streamline regulations and clarify institutional roles and responsibilities 
for wind and solar development 
• Reform the current market framework to improve project bankability 
• Bundle renewable energy projects to strengthen risk mitigation and 
ensure their financial viability 
• Conduct comprehensive measurement campaigns for solar and wind 
potential 
• Develop a master plan for enhancing local manufacturing capabilities 
and create a vibrant domestic renewable energy industry 
Renewable Energy Outlook: Egypt recommends seven key actions to accelerate the country’s 
uptake of renewables:
Recommended actionsINTRODUCTION1.1 Country background
Located in the north-eastern part of Africa, the Arab Republic of Egypt is bordered 
by the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the east, and is therefore 
at the crossroads between Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. With an 
area of over 1 million square kilometres (km2), Egypt is the world’s 30th-largest 
country, the majority of the landscape being desert with a few scattered oases. Of 
the total population, 95% is concentrated along the narrow Nile Valley and Delta, 
corresponding to only about 5% of the total land area (World Bank, 2017). In 2016, 
the population exceeded 95 million inhabitants, with those aged between 15 and 
29 years representing 27% of the population (CAPMAS, 2017). Egypt is the most 
populous country in North Africa and the Arab region and the 15th most populous 
in the world, with half of its residents living in urban areas.
Egypt is a lower-middle income country and economic activity is concentrated in 
the services, industrial and agricultural sectors, with their respective contributions 
of 55%, 33% and 12% to gross domestic product (GDP) (Trading Economics, 2017). 
The country’s fast-growing population is putting a strain on existing infrastructure 
and services. In 2015, 28% of the total population lived below the national poverty 
line, with an even higher rate of 60% recorded in Upper Egypt. Furthermore, the 
unemployment rate reached 12% in mid-2016 (comprised mainly of 26% of the 
youth group aged between 15 and 29 years), up from a 9% unemployment rate 
prior to 2011 (Trading Economics, 2017).
01From the 1990s, Egypt’s state-driven economy 
shifted to a market-based, liberalised one, capitalising 
on trade, privatisation and investment. This in turn 
led to exchange rate stabilisation, accompanied by 
a significant increase in foreign investment thanks 
to the adoption of several legislative reforms and 
structural arrangements targeted at corporate, 
income and sales taxes, alongside other financial 
reforms that were preceded by the International 
Monetary Fund’s debt relief. Then, from the early 
2010s, economic indicators showed a rapid decline 
in the value of imports and exports, with the 
trade balance as a percentage of GDP falling from 
45.2% in 2011 to 30% in 2016 (Trading Economics, 
2017). In 2014, driven by fiscal imbalances and 
energy shortages, the government introduced a 
comprehensive consolidation programme, which 
included among other measures a tariff and subsidy 
phase-out scheme.
The Egyptian economy started to pick up by the 
end of 2015, with GDP achieving higher, more 
stable annual growth rates (4.3% in fiscal year 
2015/16 and 4.0% in 2016/17), with GDP per capita 
reaching USD3 514 in 2016/17 (World Bank, 2017), 
accompanied by a slight decline in public debt and 
external debt’s contribution to GDP.
Despite macroeconomic conditions showing signs of 
stabilisation, several factors challenge the national 
economic situation today. Inflation continues to be 
a major concern, spiking at a record 32% in August 
2017. Furthermore, exchange rate misalignments 
due to currency depreciation, along with the 
introduction of value-added tax (VAT) and increased 
foreign borrowing, led to tighter monetary policy 
by the Central Bank of Egypt and threatened fiscal 
consolidation (World Bank, 2017). Furthermore, 
external economic dynamics, in the context of lower 
international oil prices and remittances, contribute to 
an uncertain climate for investment.
According to Egypt’s Economic Outlook for 2017, 
the country’s economy should recover by 2019, as 
presented in Figure 1 (World Bank, 2017). It provides 
further detail on the changes to the indicators that 
are used to develop the estimates and forecasts for 
economic growth, as depicted in the Outlook.

1.2 Energy for development 
 in Egypt
The Sustainable Development Strategy: Egypt Vision 
2030 (MOP, 2015) was announced in February 
2016 and is indicative of the country’s aspirations 
to achieve a competitive, balanced and diversified 
The Egyptian energy sector is a key driver for the 
socio-economic development of Egypt, representing 
around 13% of current GDP and thus making 
economic growth in the country contingent upon the 
security and stability of energy supply. Since 2007, 
Egypt has experienced an energy supply deficit due 
to the rapid increase in energy consumption and the 
depletion of domestic oil and gas resources, shifting 
its position as a net hydrocarbon exporter for the 
last three decades to that of a net importer. This has 
brought a set of challenges to the energy sector, 
economy by 2030 to secure sustainable development 
in a protected environment for all Egyptians. The 
strategy identified a set of targeted development 
indicators to be reached by 2020 and 2030, among 
which several indicators relate to energy and set 
significant renewable energy penetration targets, as 
depicted in Table 1.
decline of domestic gas production, as natural gas is 
the main source of electricity, accompanied by highly 
subsidised energy prices, with negative financial 
implications for already dwindling government 
revenues.
In response, the Government of Egypt has taken bold 
steps to adopt an energy diversification strategy 
with increased development of renewable energy 
and implementation of energy efficiency, including 
assertive rehabilitation and maintenance programmes

that the total installed capacity of renewable energy 
stands at 3.7 gigawatts (GW) (mainly 2.8 GW 
of hydro and 0.887 GW of solar and wind) with a 
commitment from the government to develop an 
additional 10 GW of wind and solar projects by 2022, 
whereby renewables would contribute to 20% of the 
electricity mix (IRENA, 2018a).
1.3 Methodologies
This study was conducted jointly by the International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the New 
and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) of Egypt, 
applying two methodologies previously developed 
by IRENA, namely the Renewables Readiness 
Assessment (RRA) process and REmap – or 
Renewable Energy Roadmap – analysis.
Renewables Readiness Assessment
The RRA process is a comprehensive assessment 
tool for the promotion and deployment of renewable 
energy, which has been developed by IRENA. It 
consists of a methodology designed to define a 
detailed list of criteria considered necessary for the 
ongoing operation of existing renewable energy 
facilities, along with the further development of 
renewable energy. Applying this framework to 
individual countries provides a comprehensive 
analysis of the presence or absence of enabling 
conditions for the development of renewables.
The RRA is a country-initiated and -led process which 
provides a venue for a multi-stakeholder dialogue to 
identify challenges to renewable energy deployment 
and to propose actionable recommendations to 
overcome them. This involves four main phases: 
initiation and demonstration of intent; country 
assessment and action plan; RRA country validation 
and finalisation; and follow-up. The process includes 
completing a set of templates and a final report. 
Under the RRA, all processes and documentation are 
led by the country and derive inputs from discussions 
with stakeholders facilitated by the country focal 
point, the NREA, with the assistance of IRENA and 
other development partners.
The RRA facilitates a co ordinated approach and the 
financial institutions and the private sector regarding 
the implementation of actionable recommendations 
emerging from the RRA report.
In Egypt, the RRA was initiated in April 2016 in 
conjunction with the NREA, and included a series 
of national stakeholder consultations throughout 
the RRA’s four-phase implementation process. An 
overall objective of this project is to highlight the key 
results that can contribute to formulating Egypt’s 
renewable energy development action plan, helping 
mobilise all resources necessary to carry out the 
actions identified and flagging the potential issues 
that need to be further addressed. More specifically, 
the RRA aims to:
• Identify the critical and emerging issues 
associated with, and arising from, the 
development of Egypt’s energy sector in general 
and the development of the widespread use 
of renewable energy resources in particular.
• Recommend a portfolio of articulated 
actionable recommendations that can capitalise 
on the opportunities revealed through the 
examination of Egypt’s energy sector and the 
extensive discussions that have taken place 
with multiple stakeholders during the RRA 
process, identifying how to effectively turn 
the assessed potential of resources into a real 
utilisation of renewable energy resources.
• Outline follow-up activities to ensure the 
recommendations identified are actionable in 
the near- and mid-term timeframe and in line 
with the nationally approved strategies.
Finally, this report serves to facilitate synergy and 
co ordination among the stakeholders involved to 
help implement the objectives of Egypt’s Integrated 
Sustainable Energy Strategy to 2035.
REmap – Renewable Energy Roadmap 
analysis
Egypt’s engagement with IRENA on REmap began 
in early 2015. The results of an initial REmap analysis 
for the country were published as part of the 2016 
REmap global report entitled “Roadmap for a expand it to provide a more detailed assessment. 
This effort was aided by an expert officer seconded 
by the Egyptian NREA. This seconded officer worked 
at the IRENA Innovation and Technology Centre in 
Bonn, Germany, for three months supporting the 
expanded and detailed assessment presented in this 
report. The results of this analysis were presented 
in Cairo in May of 2017 during the RRA and REmap 
workshop. Participants provided in-depth views and 
critique, and the analysis was subsequently revised. 
In September 2017, the revised analysis was again 
shared with the NREA and IRENA for further review.
The REmap analysis for Egypt utilises IRENA’s 
internally developed REmap tool, incorporating data 
and analysis done by IRENA and Egyptian experts 
on energy system development and renewables 
potential in the country. It provides assumptions and 
a standardised REmap approach for assessment of 
technologies in terms of their cost, investment and 
benefits.
The REmap analysis looks out to the year 2030 
(consistent with the Egyptian calendar year 
2029/30). The year is chosen as the standard 
assessment timeframe for REmap due to it being in 
the medium term, a common year for global efforts 
such as the Sustainable Development Goals, and a 
common year in Egypt for national-level targets (for 
2029/30).
The REmap analysis starts by building the energy 
balance of a country using 2014 as the base year of 
the analysis (2013/14), based on national data and 
statistics, other literature and sources. The country 
then provides its latest national energy plans and 
scenarios for renewables and fossil fuels, collated 
to produce a business-as-usual perspective of the 
energy system, referred to as the Reference Case, 
also known as the baseline. This includes total final 
energy consumption (TFEC) for each end-use sector 
(buildings, industry and transport) and distinguishes 
between power, district heating and direct uses of 
energy, with a breakdown by energy carrier, for the 
period to 2030.
Once the Reference Case is complete, the additional 
renewable energy potential by technology is 
examined for each sector. The potential of these 
technologies is described as REmap Options.1 Each 
REmap Option replaces a non-renewable energy 
technology2 to deliver the same energy service. 
The resulting case, when all of these options are 
aggregated, is called the REmap Case.
Throughout this study, the renewable energy share 
is estimated in relation to TFEC3 in general, but 
also occasionally in relation to total primary energy 
supply (TPES) to allow for comparison with targets 
or indicators that instead focus on primary energy. 
Modern renewable energy excludes traditional uses 
of bioenergy.4
 The share of modern renewable 
energy in TFEC is equal to total modern renewable 
energy consumption in end-use sectors (including 
consumption of renewable electricity and district 
heat, and direct uses of renewables), divided by 
TFEC. The share of renewables in power generation 
is also calculated. The renewable energy share 
can also be expressed in terms of the direct uses 
of renewables only. Renewable energy use in the 
buildings sector covers the residential, commercial 
and public sectors.
The industrial sector includes the manufacturing 
and mining sectors, in which renewable energy is 
consumed in direct-use applications (e.g. process 
heat or refrigeration) and as electricity from 
renewable sources. It also includes agriculture.
The transport sector can make direct use of 
renewables through the consumption of liquid and 
gaseous biofuels or through electricity generated 
using renewable energy technologies.
1 An approach based on options rather than scenarios is deliberate. REmap is an exploratory study and not a target-setting exercise.
2 Non-renewable technologies encompass fossil fuels, non-sustainable uses of bioenergy (referred to here as traditional bioenergy) and nuclear power.
As a supplement to this report’s annexes, a detailed list of these technologies and related background data are provided on the REmap website.
3 TFEC is the energy delivered to consumers as electricity, heat or fuels that can be used directly as a source of energy. This consumption is usually subdivided 
into transport, industry, residential, commercial and public buildings, and agriculture. It excludes non-energy uses of fuels.
4 ENERGY
CONTEXT Egypt is fifth amongst the oil-producing countries of Africa, with a daily production 
of 588 000 barrels, and is the continent’s largest oil and gas consumer. The 
volatility in the global oil market and increases in its own energy consumption 
limit the contribution of Egypt’s hydrocarbon exports to international markets. In 
this context, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts, electricity 
generating capacity will continue to struggle to keep pace with rising demand, 
which will be one of the highest in Africa by the mid-2020s, and in response the 
country aims to increase capacity by scaling up renewables.
The country aims to double its installed electricity capacity by 2020 from its 
current level in 2018 of around 50 GW, through the introduction of renewables, 
coal and nuclear power. The government has taken several initiatives in the power 
sector to cope with the energy imbalance, including increased reliance on gas 
imports, diversification through renewables and energy efficiency measures, and 
operation and maintenance (O&M) programmes.
Egypt is close to reaching universal access to electricity, with the electrification 
rate estimated at over 99.8% (World Bank, 2017). Most of the population, including 
rural areas, receive adequate electricity services. However, the country’s energy 
crisis reached a peak in 2014. In turn, this emphasised the need for the Egyptian 
government to prioritise the implementation of an electricity diversification strategy 
to ensure a sustained, reliable provision of electricity. The electricity market in 2014 
was marked by multiple disruptions and blackouts due to, among other factors, 
fuel shortages, infrastructure limitations, distortion of the exported fuel price, and 
population growth, all of which contributed to a widening of the gap between 
supply and demand. The electricity deficit was reported as reaching its highest 
point in August 2014, with a peak demand of 28 GW. Despite the availability of 
installed capacity, these plants were unable to keep up with peak demand due to 
022.1 Energy sector governance
The overall governance of the Egyptian energy 
sector is guided at the strategy and policy level by 
regulations and directions issued by the Supreme 
Energy Council (SEC) and is managed at the 
execution level by the Ministry of Petroleum and 
Mineral Resources and the Ministry of Electricity and 
Renewable Energy (MOERE). Both ministries work 
in co operation with other relevant ministries and 
public entities, and in consultation with the private 
sector and non-governmental organisations. The 
corresponding sections below provide an overview 
of the responsibilities of these three government 
entities. Tables 10 and 11 provide a summary of the 
role of the institutions involved in Egypt’s renewable 
energy schemes and the principal functions of the 
main national energy stakeholders in Egypt that 
are active in the deployment of renewables in the 
country.
1. The Supreme Energy Council (SEC) was 
established in 1979 under the Prime Minister’s 
decree No. 1093 and was reformed in 2014. 
Headed and formed by the Prime Minister and 
including all relevant ministries, it is mandated 
to review and endorse national energy strategies 
and policies, monitor the sector’s performance 
and energy pricing policies and approve policies 
and regulations on energy pricing and incentives 
for energy sector investments (including 
promotion of energy efficiency and renewable 
energy investment).
2. The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources
is entrusted with the overall management of all 
petroleum activities in the country, including 
exploration, production and distribution of oil, oil 
products and gas, as well as all related services. 
The ministry implements its mandate through 
three affiliated entities: the Egyptian General 
Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), the Egyptian 
Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS), and 
Ganoub El Wadi Petroleum Holding Company 
(GANOPE).
3. The Ministry of Electricity and Renewable 
Energy (MOERE) is entrusted with the overall 
management of the Egyptian electricity sector 
through its subsidiary company the Egyptian 
Electricity Holding Company (EEHC), and 
in co-ordination with the Egyptian Electric 
Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory 
Agency (EgyptERA), NREA, Hydro Power 
Plants Executive Authority, Nuclear Power Plant 
Authority and Atomic Power Plants Authority.
2.2 Energy resources
Egypt’s fossil fuel energy resource endowments 
(including oil, natural gas and negligible amounts of 
low-quality coal) are limited. As of end-2014, total 
proven reserves of petroleum energy (crude oil and 
natural gases) stood at about 14.8 billion barrels (bbl) 
of oil equivalent, of which 3.4 billion bbl were in the 
form of crude oil and about 11.4 billion as natural gas 
(equivalent to 64 trillion cubic feet of natural gas) 
(BP, 2017a).
Despite dwindling fossil fuel resources, Egypt enjoys 
an abundance of renewable energy resources – solar, 
wind, biomass and hydro. Average daily sunshine 
totals about 9 to 11 hours per day, with solar direct 
radiation intensity of about 2 000–3 200 kilowatt 
hours per square metre (kWh/m²) per year that can 
be utilised for both power generation and thermal 
applications. In addition, Egypt is endowed with 
vast wind resources, with average annual speeds 
reaching 8–10 metres per second (m/s) by the coast 
of the Red Sea and 6–8 m/s along the south-west 
Nile banks and in the south of the Western Desert, 
which can be utilised for electricity generation. 
More than 30 million tonnes of solid biomass waste 
are also produced annually from both agriculture 
and municipal resources. Despite an abundance of 
biomass, hydro, wind and solar renewable sources, 
the significant potential to harness energy from 
these sources remains untapped.
2.3 Energy supply and demand
Egypt’s TPES mainly comprises (in order of utilisation) 
natural gas, oil, oil products and hydro, along with 
wind and solar (Figure 2). In 2014/15, natural gas 
accounted for 45% of TPES, with production of 
36.23 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe); oil 
(including crude, liquefied natural gas [LNG] and feedstocks) accounted for 34% of TPES with a 
production of 27.09 Mtoe; and oil products, composed 
of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene for 
heating and cooking, diesel oil and gasoline for 
transport, accounted for 17% of TPES (IEA, 2017). To 
compensate for increased local demand, imports of 
oil and oil products, combined with decreased natural 
gas resources, saw a spike in their contribution to 
TPES. As regards electricity production, natural gas 
and dual-fuel plants accounted for 92% of the power 
produced in 2015. Natural gas is also consumed by 
the industrial, petroleum (enhanced oil recovery), 
residential, commercial and transport sectors. 
Hydroelectric power and renewables (including wind 
and solar photovoltaics), accounted for 7.5% and 1% 
of the electricity mix respectively, as represented in 
Figure 8.
Due to insufficient production of crude oil and 
oil products, total petroleum imports have been 
rising, reaching 90.44 million bbl with a value of 
USD 11 billion in 2012/13, and USD 13.2 billion in 2014. 
Furthermore, the decline in natural gas production 
has triggered the country to import LNG since
2014 (BP, 2017b). The share of renewable energy 
in TFEC stands at 8.7%, including, hydro, solar 
and wind.
In the short term, the government has addressed 
the issue of depleting gas reserves and ensured a 
continuous gas supply through the lease of two 
floating storage regasification units to allow for 
LNG imports. This ensured the ability to secure 
sufficient power generation capacity fed by natural 
gas through a) the completion of a fast-track 
investment programme, which targets steam turbine 
and open-cycle gas turbine (OCGT) capacity, and b) 
the construction of 14.4 GW of combined-cycle gas 
turbine (CCGT) capacity, comprising three power 
plants of 4.8 GW capacity, expected completion by 
May 2018 (EEHC, 2016a).
The development of renewable energy in Egypt 
represents a major element in addressing the 
challenges it faces to secure adequate power 
production due to inconsistent levels of gas 
production, and in tackling significant increases in 
carbon dioxide (CO2
) emissions.
TFEC amounted to 51.86 Mtoe in 2014/15, with 
transport being the major consumer at 35%, followed 
by the industrial sector at 27%, residential and 
commercial at 24% and 7% respectively, non-energy 
use (mainly for fertiliser production) at 6%, agriculture 
at 3% and other sectors at 2% (UNStats, 2015).

Less than 1%2.4 Energy subsidies
For decades, Egypt has relied on subsidised energy 
prices as an instrument for social protection and 
wealth sharing. This has led to a rapid increase 
in demand, with the subsidy bill increasing at a 
compound annual rate of 26% between 2002 and 
2013. Energy subsidies for oil products and natural 
gas reached EGP 128 billion (about USD 20 billion) 
in 2012/13, as shown in Figure 3, with an additional 
EGP 27 billion (about USD 4.2 billion) for the 
electricity sector.
In 2013/14, energy subsidies (indirect, direct 
and cross-subsidies) accounted for 22% of the 
government budget and nearly 7% of GDP (MOERE, 
2017), with electricity subsidies constituting 20% of 
the energy subsidy bill.
Energy subsidies fell to EGP 73.9 billion in 2014/15, 
as shown in Figure 3. The decline in oil prices (to 
USD 36 at the end of 2015 for Brent) reduced the 
fuel subsidy bill by some USD 10 billion in 2015 from 
a total recorded of USD 25 billion in 2013. However, 
declining resources and refining capacity posed a 
substantial budgetary burden on the government, 
contributing to the fiscal deficit in the energy sector, 
which rose from 1.3% in 2010/11 to 16.8% in 2013/14.
To tackle declining resource capacity, in 2014 the 
Egyptian government decided to launch exploration 
campaigns through partnerships between the 
national oil company and international oil companies 
(IOCs) to advance Egyptian natural gas production, 
thus reducing reliance on imports. The produced fuel 
was sold to the state-owned electricity distributor 
or private distributors without taking into account 
fluctuations in international prices, along with the 
devaluation of the currency. Egypt’s objective is to 
manage its energy deficit through increased domestic 
production, as a substitute for expensive imports. 
Considering the heavy burden of fuel subsidies on 
the government, in 2014 the country announced 
gradual energy subsidy reform for gasoline, diesel 
and natural gas with a subsidy phase-out for 
electricity by 2019. A target of reducing subsidies to 
EGP 4 billion was set for 2017, from EGP 30 billion 
in 2016 (Ahram Online, 2016), and a phase-out of all 
energy subsidies five years later, which is elaborated 
on in further detail in Chapter 2.

742.5 Electricity sector governance
The Egyptian electricity sector is managed by 
the MOERE and overseen by the SEC. The sector 
is regulated by EgyptERA, which is responsible 
for implementing policy decisions, administering 
licences and, as of 2015, for setting tariffs with the 
adoption of the New Electricity Law No. 87 of 2015. 
The MOERE provided EgyptERA with the authority 
to set electricity tariffs, thus providing a solution 
to the heavy burden placed on the government 
(EgyptERA, 2015).
Historically, generation, transmission and distribution 
assets were fully state-owned and operated under 
the supervision of the Egyptian Electricity Authority 
(EEA), now known as the EEHC. The power generation 
sector began moving towards private-sector 
participation in the late 1990s,5
 although it did not 
become prevalent until 2001. As such, the unbundling 
of generation and transmission and distribution (T&D) 
was initiated by the EEHC. The EEHC owns 90% of 
Egypt’s generation capacity (under six generating 
companies) and the entire state-owned T&D network 
(comprising one transmission and nine distribution 
companies), although EEHC’s monopoly has begun 
to make way for limited competition from private 
distribution companies. Each public generation and 
distribution subsidiary under the EEHC umbrella is 
established as a separate corporate entity with its 
own board (EU, 2015b).
The introduction of the New Electricity Law No. 87 
of 2015 (EgyptERA, 2016a) ended the monopoly 
on T&D to create a new competitive power market 
based on bilateral contracts. However, private 
participation is so far on a limited scale, accounting 
for only 10% of total power generation, with power 
input generated from non-renewable sources.
The NREA is the state agency responsible for 
developing renewable energy. While the NREA 
functions independently from the EEHC and other 
state-owned electricity companies, it nonetheless 
reports to both the MOERE and EgyptERA.
Figure 4 provides further elaboration on the 
electricity sector governance described above.

Total installed electricity generation capacity in the 
year 2015/16 amounted to 38 857 megawatts (MW) 
(EEHC, 2016a), comprising OCGT plants (7 845MW), 
CCGT plants (12 527 MW), hydro (2 800 MW), 
steam power plants (14 798 MW) and non-hydro 
renewables (887MW) as highlighted in Figure 5.
The private sector contributed 2048 MW through 
the BOOT scheme for thermal electricity generation 
capacity. Peak load was recorded at 29.2GW in 
2015/16 (Figure 6) (EEHC, 2016a).

MWEgypt’s power demand has grown consistently over 
the past decade, recording an annual growth rate 
of 6%. In 2016, the peak load demand was close to 
installed capacity (MOERE, 2017). 
In 2014, the MOERE initiated plans to add 51.3 
GW of conventional and renewable sources to 
respond to the growing power needs, based on an 
estimated annual requirement for new capacity of
approximately (though not consistently) 2.5 GW
per year, as illustrated in Figure 7.
Given the increase in installed capacity, total 
electricity generation in 2015/16 amounted to 
186 320 gigawatt hours (GWh), whereas total 
electricity consumption was 156 300 GWh in 
2015/16, resulting in sufficient reserves of over 
16.11% to meet electricity demand surges.
Figure 6. Development of installed capacity and peak load
Note: Electricity shortages were not due to the lack of installed capacity, but due to insufficient supply of fuel to maintain continuous 
power generation.

2.7 Transmission and distribution
Egypt’s transmission network consists of overhead 
transmission lines and underground cables, with a total 
length of 44 200 kilometres (km) and a total transformer 
capacity of 99600 megavolt amperes (MVA). 
Moreover, Egypt has electricity interconnection lines 
with its neighbours Jordan and Libya, as shown 
in Figure 10, indicating the electricity exchange 
from year 2011/12 to 2015/16 (EEHC, 2016a).
Egypt’s distribution network constitutes 460 897 
km of low-voltage and medium-voltage lines and 
cables with a total transformer capacity of 71 103 MVA
(EEHC, 2016a).
The number of customers served by the affiliated 
T&D companies on all voltages reached 32.4 million in 
2015/16 compared with 31.4 million in 2014/15, a rate 
of increase of 3.2% (EEHC, 2016a).

GWh
Sold and exported Purchased and importedAccording to the New Electricity Law No. 87 of 
2015, the grid will operate under two market 
schemes, the regulated and the competitive, such 
that the transmission company, the Egyptian 
Electricity Transmission Company (EETC), operates 
as a TSO in both markets but with distinct roles. 
Under the regulated market, EETC will purchase 
electricity from generators and sell to customers 
that are not eligible under the competitive market 
scheme, including customers at the LV and MV 
residential level. However, in the competitive 
market industrial HV and extra-high-voltage users 
will purchase electricity from generators directly 
(making up 16% of current consumption). In this 
market, generators will simply pay a wheeling fee 
to the TSO, i.e. EETC, as depicted in Figure 4.
Under the regulated market, distribution 
companies (comprising nine public and seven 
private companies) will sell directly to end users, 
purchasing electricity from EETC to distribute it to 
end users such as MV and LV customers. However, 
in the competitive market, the distribution 
companies will lose their role and be phased out 
of this network, as shown in Figure 4.
2.8 Costs and tariffs
The New Electricity Law No. 87 of 2015 indicates 
that electricity tariffs are to be set according to the 
cost of producing energy (or an energy service) 
and its associated variables including the cost of 
transmitting energy, the rate of inflation, a fuel 
coefficient and more recently the targets set by 
the subsidy reform. This is based on the calculation 
methodology set by EgyptERA (EgyptERA, 2016b).
The production cost of electricity in Egypt averaged 
USD 0.045 (EGP 0.855) per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 
2017, up from USD 0.04 (EGP 0.64) per kWh in 
2016,6 and up from USD 0.03 (EGP 0.47) per kWh 
in 2014.7
In comparison to other countries in the region, 
electricity tariffs are considered to be low, if not one 
of the lowest. Using a brackets system, electricity 
tariffs in Egypt vary according to feeding voltage 
level and type of consumer group, amount of 
consumption and time of usage (peak/off-peak) 
periods. Residential tariffs are divided into seven 
blocks ranging from EGP 0.138 for the first block of 
monthly consumption up to 50 kWh, to EGP 1.35 
for over 1 000 kWh of consumption, paid as a flat 
rate for the total consumption.
A five-year plan to phase out internal subsidies 
in the electricity sector was officially endorsed as 
per the Prime Minister’s Decree No. 1257 of 2014. 
Steps were taken in July 2014 to implement a 
comprehensive five-year subsidy reform initiative, 
which includes annual tariff increases for most user 
segments on 1 July each year until 2018. Annual 
tariff increases have been deemed necessary by 
the government to eliminate subsidies, the effects 
of which have been exacerbated by currency 
devaluation and financial obligations of the 
Ministry of Finance (MOF) to meet return deficits 
resulting from the low electricity sale revenues 
that the national oil company (Egyptian General 
Petroleum Corp.) is subject to in the grid. This 
situation, in turn, does not aid EEHC in covering its 
financial debt to IOCs that have set up exploration 
sites to support the domestic production of fossil 
fuels; therefore, the MOF must also compensate for 
this balance of debt (for example EGP 0.75 billion 
for grid capacity expansion and maintenance and 
IOC debts).
While the annual tariff increase has allowed 
the government to save EGP 18 billion from 
the electricity subsidy bill, the government has 
recently extended the subsidy to 2022. The plan 
was subject to two revisions in July 2015 and 2016 
to ensure the protection of low-income consumers, 
while compensating for the accelerated increase 
in the sector ’s expenditure on new plants, taking 
into account the changes in the USD exchange rate 
(ENFRWC, 2017).

 and trade
Since the late 1980s, the Egyptian government has 
devoted efforts to identifying and implementing 
several electricity grid interconnection projects 
in co-operation with other countries of the Arab 
region to enhance the sector’s reliability and allow 
for the exchange of generated electricity at the subregional level. Feasibility studies were performed to 
evaluate the interconnection potential with subSaharan African countries and in co operation with 
European countries through several EU funded 
projects.
Interconnection projects in the Arab region have 
connected Egypt to Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the 
Syrian Arab Republic, and Turkey as shown in Table 2.
The first phase of these interconnection projects 
used 400 kilovolt (kV) lines to link Egypt, Jordan, 
Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic. This was 
completed and became operational in the mid1990s. The second phase was delayed due to 
regional political instability.
The Arab-Maghreb interconnection linked Egypt to 
Libya as of 1998 through a 220 kV power line that 
will be integrated further with Morocco and Tunisia 
through a 400/500 kV line to be completed by the 
end of 2018.
An Egypt-Saudi Arabia interconnection is expected 
to be operational by 2021, with an exchange 
capacity of 3 000 MW (Ahram Online, 2017). The 
Arab League adopted a resolution in September 
2016 to support actions for the establishment of 
Pan-Arab Electricity Market Integration to create a 
common electricity market in the region (LAS and 
RCREEE, 2016).
Several steps have been taken to explore the 
possibility of building interconnections with 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa. A study was 
completed on the feasibility of interconnections 
between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan to exchange 
3 200 MW, of which 2 000 MW would be dedicated 
to Egypt. In parallel, a 200 MW project to connect 
Egypt and Sudan is ongoing. Other efforts are 
being explored to evaluate the potential of forming 
interconnections with the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo (LAS and RCREEE, 2016).
Egypt continues to work with the European 
Union to evaluate feasible options to facilitate 
future exchange of electrical power across the 
Mediterranean, particularly from renewable 
energy sources, through possible interconnections 
between Tunisia and Italy, and potentially between 
Egypt, Cyprus and Greece. The prospective 
interconnections would serve to transfer electricity 
generated from renewable energy sources to 
Europe (EEHC, 2016b).

ENERGYThis chapter covers Egypt’s available renewable energy resources, their current 
status and their future development potential. It also addresses the enabling 
environment and related regulatory framework for renewable energy.
Renewables can have a myriad of benefits: renewable energy technologies can 
often provide a secure and reliable energy alternative, while investment in local 
renewable energy infrastructure and services can create significant local added 
value through job creation and boosting local economic growth (IRENA, 2017c). 
Moreover, power provided by renewables would free up depleting hydrocarbon 
reserves, reducing distortion of the energy markets by alleviating the heavy 
burden subsidies place on government finance and investment.
Egypt enjoys an abundance of renewable energy resources with high deployment 
potential. These are mainly hydro, wind, solar and biomass. Since the late 1970s, 
the Egyptian government has initiated programmes for demonstrating, testing 
and evaluating different renewable energy applications and technology systems 
in co-operation with various countries and international entities, including France, 
Germany, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Japan, the European Union and the United 
States. The co operation between these entities translated into the installation 
of solar water heaters (SWHs) in new cities, solar industrial process heat systems 
(SIPHS), wind farms and photovoltaic (PV) applications in water pumping, 
cold stores and desalination plants, as well as biogas digesters in rural areas.
The establishment of the NREA in 1986 (through Law No. 102 of the year 1986) 
was an important milestone in efforts to develop renewable energy sources in 
Egypt. The NREA focuses particularly on wind and solar technologies and has 
recently expanded its focus to include biomass development. Other national 
institutions have also devoted efforts to biomass development, among them the 
033.1 Renewable energy contribution 
 to primary energy production
The contribution of renewable energy resources 
to primary energy production stood at 4% in 
2009/10, mainly from hydro (3%) and wind (1%). 
Their contribution is expected to reach a total of 
8% by 2021/22 and 14% in 2034/35, corresponding 
to 22.8 Mtoe in that year. On the basis of those 
contributions, renewable energy is expected to 
make up 20% and 42% of electricity generation 
in 2021/22 and 2034/35, respectively (EU, 2015a). 
The average growth rate for renewable energy in 
primary energy supply reaches 7.3%, as depicted in 
Figure 19.
3.2 Renewable energy contribution 
 to installed power capacity
The total installed capacity of renewable energy 
sources is expected to reach 19.2 GW by 2021/22 
and increase to 49.5 GW and 62.6 GW in years 
2029/30 and 2034/35 respectively. Table 3 shows 
the development of installed electric capacity for 
the different renewable technologies from 2009 
to 2035 (EU, 2015a). The MOERE and the Ministry 
of Investment and International Cooperation have 
recently modified the long-term energy strategy, 
maximising the contribution of renewable energy 
in the capacity mix to 42% in 2035, alongside 
maximising energy efficiency measures. The 
subsections that follow address the different 
sources of renewable energy technologies deployed 
in Egypt.
3.3 Renewable energy potential 
 and use
Hydroelectric energy
The main hydro resource in Egypt is the River Nile, 
with the highest potential in Aswan where a series of 
power stations are located totalling 2 800 MW, with 
corresponding electric generation of 13 545GWh 
annually. Hydroelectricity represented almost 50% 
of the Egypt’s total generated electricity in the 
1960s and 1970s. However, due to the increase in 
the share of thermal power stations, electricity from 
hydro resources represented only 7.2% of the total 
electricity generated in 2015/16 (EEHC, 2016a).
Hydropower is the most mature of the renewable 
energy technologies in Egypt, with an average rate 
of growth in energy generated from hydropower 
plants of 1.2% per year during the period 2011/12 
to 2015/16. In this context, several projects have 
been realised and the breakdown of hydroelectric 
stations in 2015 is depicted in Table 4.

East, Fourth Edition.An additional four hydroelectric plants are being 
developed at Assiut in Upper Egypt with a capacity 
of 32 MW, and are due to become operational by 
late 2018.
In 2015, plans to build a 2 400 MW pumped storage 
hydroelectric plant in Attaqa were initiated, due for 
completion in 2022 (Andritz, 2016). This project 
is due to operate at peak hours, based on water 
flowing from an upper to a lower reservoir with a 
28-metre height difference. In the off-peak period, 
the flow is reversed and the upper reservoir will 
refill normally by using the turbines as pumps and 
the generators as motors.
The electricity needed to operate the motor 
generators is produced by surplus power capacity 
available during off-peak periods. A conditional 
contract was signed with Sanyo in China for building 
the plant subject to the acceptance of the technical 
and financial offers by the MOERE and EEHC. The 
project is expected to start operation in late 2022.
Wind energy
According to Egypt’s Wind Atlas (Wind Atlas for 
Egypt Measurement and Modelling 1991-2005), 
the country is endowed with abundant wind 
energy resources, particularly in the Gulf of Suez 
area. This is one of the best locations in the world 
for harnessing wind energy due to its high stable 
wind speeds that reach on average between 8 and 
10 m/s at a height of 100 metres, along with the 
availability of large uninhabited desert areas.
Moreover, promising new regions have been 
discovered east and west of the Nile river in the 
Beni Suef and Menya Governorates and El Kharga 
Oasis in the New Valley Governorate. They offer 
wind speeds that vary between 5 and 8 m/s and 
are suitable for electricity generation from wind 
and other applications such as water pumping. 
Figure 15 presents the new wind atlas published in 
2016 on IRENA’s Global Atlas platform, measured 
at a resolution of 1 km and a height of 200 metres.

The first wind farm in Egypt was established 
in Hurghada in 1993 with 42 units of differing 
technologies and a total capacity of 5.2 MW. Since 
2001, the NREA, in co-operation with Germany, 
Spain, Japan and Denmark, has established a series 
of large-scale wind farms that totalled 545 MW 
in 2010/11, increased to 750 MW in November 
2015, under an engineering, procurement and 
construction (EPC) scheme in both Zaafarana 
(545 MW) and Gulf of El Zayt (200 MW).
This installed capacity corresponded to total windgenerated electricity ranging from 260 GWh in 
2001/02 to 2 058 GWh in 2015/16. Accordingly, 
total conventional fuel savings as a result of 
utilising wind energy for electricity generation 
increased from 58 Mtoe in 2001/02 to 432 Mtoe in 
2015/16. Consequently, the avoided CO2
 emissions 
are estimated at 143 000 tonnes in 2001/02 
and 1.131 million tonnes in 2015/16 (EEHC, 2016a). 
In this context, Figure 16 provides further detail on
the evolution of wind-generated electricity in
Egypt in the past 10 years.

Four wind power plants, with a total installed 
capacity of 2 610 MW, are planned to be installed 
and operational by year 2023. They are being 
developed co-operatively between the NREA and 
EETC, and will be constructed by international 
and Egyptian private-sector entities through 
either build-own-operate (BOO) or EPC schemes. 
In addition, 2 000 MW capacity of wind energy 
projects are being progressed by Siemens under an 
EPC and finance scheme; it includes the creation of 
a manufacturing facility for the necessary blades, 
according to a memorandum of understanding 
signed between the NREA and Siemens in April 
2015. Further details on the planned wind projects 
up to 2023 are highlighted in Table 5.

Solar energy
Egypt enjoys favourable solar radiation intensity. 
In 1991, the solar atlas for Egypt was issued 
indicating that the country enjoys between 2 900 
and 3 200 hours of sunshine annually, with annual 
direct normal intensity of 1 970-3 200 kWh/m2
and a total radiation intensity varying between 
2 000 and 3 200 kWh/m2
/year from the north to
the south of Egypt, as presented in Figure 17. 
IRENA’s Global Atlas platform combines recent 
irradiation potential and includes a new solar atlas 
released in 2016, thus reiterating Egypt’s high 
solar potential. On a global scale, Egypt is one of 
the most appropriate regions for exploiting solar 
energy both for electricity generation and thermal 
heating applications.Figure 17. Egypt’s Solar Atlas

Since the early 1980s, solar PV systems have been 
demonstrated in Egypt for different applications, 
including pumping, lighting, advertising, cold storage 
and desalination. The technology was used for 
commercial applications in remote areas, particularly 
for emergency road and navigation lighting.
The total installed capacity of small-scale PV 
systems amounted to 6 MW in 2013, while a 
cumulative 30 MW of off-grid power plants had 
been installed and operational by the end of 2016. 
The MOERE started to develop larger-capacity PV 
systems, particularly after the adoption of the feedin tariff (FIT) scheme in 2014. With the amplification 
of the electricity shortage in Egypt in 2014, coupled 
with the reduction in the cost of PV panels, several 
towards adopting PV applications, particularly 
rooftop systems and street lighting. The section 
that follows summarises current key achievements 
in Egypt in that regard (IETA, 2017).
Centralised grid-connected solar PV
The NREA has finalised feasibility studies for two 
large-scale PV plants with an installed capacity of 
20 MW and 26 MW, respectively, to be constructed 
in Hurghada and Kom Ombo, and expected to 
be realised late in 2019. The first is to be financed 
by JICA (Japan) and the second by AFD (France). 
They are each expected to produce about 32 GWh 
and 42 GWh annually respectively, saving about 
40000tonnes of CO2
 combined. Further details on

Installation of on-grid distributed PV systems 
only began in mid-2014 through two government 
initiatives for rooftop PV systems on public 
buildings, under which about 3 MW of PV systems 
were installed and connected to the distribution 
network. This resulted in an increase of about 10 MW 
after the adoption of the first phase of the FIT.
In 2015/16 the NREA, in co-operation with the 
United Arab Emirates, implemented several offgrid PV projects for electrification of remote 
centralised systems totalling about 30 MW; plus 
street lighting systems and hybrid PV-diesel 
systems.
Several initiatives for small-scale PV have been 
introduced to add to the total 6 MW installed up 
to 2013. Distributed solar PV technologies are 
developing quite rapidly with many projects in 
the pipeline. As electricity subsidies are removed 
and tariffs go up, the industrial and commercial 
sectors can couple small-scale PV systems to meet 
heightened energy demand and decrease their

The first solar thermal integrated combined-cycle 
power plant was constructed in the Kuraymat 
area with a total capacity of 140 MW, including 
20 MW as a solar component and 120 MW 
as a gas-fired combined-cycle plant, funded 
primarily by the Global Environment Facility.
The total area of the integrated solar field is about 
644 000 square metres (m2
), with a total solar 
collector area of 1 920 m2
 containing 53 760 mirrors.
The total electricity generated from the power plant 
was 164 GWh/year in 2015/16. Accordingly, the total 
utilising solar energy in the Kuraymat power plant 
is estimated at about 10 000 tonnes per year, and 
consequently avoided CO2
 emissions are estimated 
at about 20 000 tonnes.
In 2015, EETC and the NREA initiated a tender for a 
new concentrated solar power (CSP) plant through 
the BOO system with a capacity of 100MW. However, 
offers have yet to be received. Separately, a study 
financed by GIZ (the German development agency) 
in November 2013 suggested boosting electricity 
output by adding CSP facilities at existing Egyptian 
power plants. This would enhance the supply from, 
and effectively start to “hybridise”, those largely gas
Table 7. Small-scale PV distributed Initiatives
Small-scale PV

Energy in Egypt.Solar water heating
In the early 1980s efforts were directed towards 
the development of SWH applications in 
industry. As a first step, the MOERE imported 
1 000 SWHs of 100 to 500 litres per day capacity 
and tested selected samples in different types of 
application, as well as renting others to the public.
This initiative resulted in the establishment of 
several private-sector companies for the assembly 
and manufacture of SWHs in Egypt. Moreover, the 
Ministry of Housing and Urban Communities issued 
a decree in 1986 for the mandatory use of SWHs in 
new cities, which resulted in the installation of solar 
water heaters equivalent to 800 000 m2 coverage. 
However, as a result of the highly subsidised energy 
prices and the mismanagement of the dissemination 
process due to the lack of experienced personnel and 
awareness, the market went into decline until 2013.
By 2013, the New Urban Communities Authority 
(NUCA) had started introducing SWHs in new 
cities in co-operation with EU countries. Currently, 
there are 22 companies listed in the registry of 
the Federation of Egyptian Industries (FEI) with a 
scope of activities including the production and/
or the import of solar thermal technology. About 
12 to 14 of those companies are currently involved 
in manufacturing, while the remaining serve as 
importers, such that the total installed capacity 
amounts to about 750 000 m2
.
Egypt has proven potential for the industrial 
application of SWHs in process heat and solar thermal 
systems as a result of several demonstration projects 
that were implemented in the food and textile 
industries in the early 1990s. Thus, a USD5 million 
project was launched at the end of 2014 by the 
Ministry of Trade and Industry for small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs), to promote low-carbon 
technologies, mainly solar thermal, for cooling and 
heating in industrial applications (UNEP, 2014). 
Biomass
Egypt has large resources of biomass from 
agricultural waste, animal dung and urban 
solid waste. Agricultural waste totals about 
35 million tonnes annually, 40% of which is used for 
feeding animals, the rest being available for energy 
purposes (equivalent to 5 Mtoe/year). Urban solid 
waste averages 0.5 kilograms per person per day, 
amounting to almost 10 000 tonnes per day in 
greater Cairo alone (GIZ, 2014).
Different biomass technologies have been 
demonstrated in Egypt, in particular for the 
production of biogas from animal waste in rural 
areas, as well as for the collection and briquetting
of agricultural waste. Such technologies create 
jobs in villages and reduce the migration of young 
people to the big cities.
The Ministry of Environment, in co-operation with 
the Ministry of Local Development, is currently 
leading a programme for the treatment of municipal 
solid waste in large cities (GIZ, 2014).
The Bioenergy for Sustainable Rural Development 
Project (BSRD) (EEAA et al., 2013), led by the 
Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), 
was initiated in 2009 and funded by the United 
Nations Development Programme and the 
Global Environmental Facility. The project aims 
at encouraging young graduates to become 
entrepreneurs, while providing special support to 
women and consideration to rural areas.
The project has achieved remarkable progress in 
developing and disseminating biogas digesters and 
establishing Bioenergy Service Providers (BSPs) 
to support the market penetration of bioenergy 
in the country. The resultant BSPs are companies 
that are founded to provide job opportunities for 
young graduates through on-site training on the 
construction, curing, feeding and gas production of 
biodigesters in rural areas.
During three years of its operation, the BSRD 
developed and operated 960 biogas units of 
different sizes in 18 Egyptian governorates. Twenty 
registered BSPs were established and spread across 
Egyptian villages, providing their services to more 
than 1 000 families. The BSRD is considering a 
FIT regulation for biomass systems similar to that 
for wind and solar issued by the Prime Minister in 
October 2014 (EEHC, 2016a).3.4 Enabling framework for 
 renewable energy
Egypt adopted its first renewable energy strategy in 
1982, targeting the production of 5% of generated 
electricity from renewable energy resources by 
year 2000. However, this target was not reached 
due to the relatively high cost of renewable energy 
technologies and the heavily subsidised energy 
prices during this period.
In February 2008, following the emergence of 
the energy supply/demand gap in 2007, the SEC 
approved a new target: to source 20% of generated 
electricity from renewable energy sources by 2022. 
The SEC planned to meet its ambitious targets 
through the deployment of a variety of renewable 
energy sources, including 12% wind, 2% solar and 
6% hydropower. 
To realise these targets, the majority of the total 
capacity planned for installation is intended to 
be implemented by the government, with the 
remainder by the private sector. By January 
2011, political instability, coupled with economic 
uncertainty, meant that the strategic renewable 
energy targets had not been implemented.
In January 2013, the Government of Egypt started 
developing a new 20-year strategy, the Integrated 
Sustainable Energy Strategy (ISES) 2015 to 2035, 
through a project funded by the European Union 
and implemented in co-operation with all relevant 
national partners. In October 2016, the SEC agreed 
to a new energy strategy for Egypt, under the 
TARES approved in 2016 (EU, 2015a).9
Energy targets
The sustainable development targets for Egypt 
as they relate to energy (Egypt Sustainable 
Development Strategy, Egypt Vision 2030, issued 
2015) are:
Goal I – Ensuring security of supply
• The core objective is to ensure the availability 
of reliable energy supplies to satisfy the future 
development needs of the country through 
adoption of a more diverse energy mix and 
direct investment to provide a range of fossil 
fuels, renewable and nuclear technologies. 
Moreover, it includes rationalising the demand 
side and reforming energy subsidies without 
putting excessive financial costs onto citizens.
Goal II – Ensuring sustainability
• The core objective is to achieve both the 
technical and financial sustainability of the 
energy sector: ensuring a sufficient supply of 
diversified sources that can be utilised to deliver 
energy, and achieving financial sustainability by 
being able to fund the necessary infrastructure 
and operating costs by ensuring sufficient 
income to maximise efficiency in all operations.
Goal III – Improving institutional and corporate 
governance
• The core objective is to modernise the current 
institutional structure of public enterprises to 
cater for a more commercial framework, by 
realigning the organisational structures of the 
EEHC, EGPC and their subsidiary companies, and 
introducing the necessary training assistance to 
responsible entities, along with action plans to 
enhance energy planning and energy efficiency.
Goal IV – Strengthening competitive markets and 
regulation
• The core objective is to establish an environment 
that can help build competitive energy markets 
as a key step in driving down costs and 
promoting market liberalisation to support 
greater transparency and efficiency within the 
electricity, gas and oil markets.The energy strategy agreed by the SEC in October 
2016, was based on:
• Data made available from both the petroleum 
and electricity sectors.
• The sustainable development report 2015 for 
Egypt (MOP, 2015).
• The study entitled “Combined Renewable 
Energy Master Plan (CREMP)”, final form issued 
in December 2015.
• The “ISES 2035” report issued in November 
2015 (EU, 2015a).
The ISES to 2035 integrated the findings from 
previous studies, including the CREMP, as well as 
the existing plans for the diversification of supply 
utilising both nuclear and coal. The ISES outlined 
several scenarios for the energy mix up to year 
2035. The scenarios were assessed based on key 
issues in the Egyptian energy system, including the 
following:
• energy import dependence
• diversification of the primary energy supply
• diversification of electricity generation
• CO2 intensity
• final energy savings considering the 
improvement in energy efficiency
• primary energy intensity
• total discounted subsidies
• total discounted system costs.
The value of the indicators, described above, for 
the year 2029/30 and for the “Most Likely” case 
of oil and gas production were used to perform 
the comparison among the scenarios. The cases 
represent a medium-/long-term perspective of the 
energy system, allowing some time for changes 
to become apparent in the different scenarios. 
In this regard, eight scenarios were assessed and 
scored against each other and the scenario with the 
highest score, Scenario 4b, was selected. A detailed 
description of the different scenarios is described 
in Annex I.
The highlights of the targets in Scenario 4b are:
1. Renewable energy
• Supply 20% of generated electricity from 
renewable sources by 2022.
• Supply 42% of generated electricity from 
renewable sources by 2035.
2. Efficiency:
• Reduce energy use by over 8% by 2022 with a 
base year of 2006/07.

• Egypt submitted its Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) in September 2015.
• Achieve “High CO2 mitigation levels” through 
measures including phasing out energy 
subsidies within three to five years and, 
potentially, a national carbon market with the 
aim of using renewables and nuclear power 
sources.
• Egypt ratified the Paris Agreement on 29 June 
2017 and it entered into force on 29 July 2017.
4. Nuclear
• Install 4-5 GW by 2025/26.
• To account for 4% of installed power generation 
capacity by 2030.
5. Natural gas and oil products
• Contribute 49% of installed power generation 
capacity by 2030, decreasing from 90% in 
2014/15.
6. Coal
• Source 15% of electricity generation from coal 
by 2030.
The average annual gross rate of TPES for the 
adopted scenario is shown in Table 8 below.
In Figures 18–20, the crucial indicators of the 
adopted energy strategy (based on Scenario 
4b) are shown for the “Most Likely” scenario. 
Scenario 4b follows the least-cost approach 
where subsidies are eliminated after 2020 and 
different energy sources can compete under the 
given market structure, with coal and nuclear 
power plants competing with renewables directly.
However, in Scenario 4b an updated nuclear 
programme leads to the share of natural gas and 
coal in the primary energy supply plateauing under 
the current market structure.

In the given Scenario 4b, renewable energy 
(including hydro, wind and solar) is expected 
to make up around 25% of the total installed 
electricity generation capacity in year 2019/20, 
whereas coal will make up 2.1%, as displayed in 
Figure 20. 
However, with the introduction of nuclear in year 
2025, the share of renewable energy sources in 
the electricity mix is expected to increase to 42% 
of the total installed capacity, where coal, natural 
gas and nuclear make up 15.8%, 37.35% and 3.27% 
respectively in 2034/35 (Figure 20).

Renewable energy laws and regulations
The Egyptian government needed to endorse a 
new set of laws and regulations to facilitate the 
implementation of the 2022 and 2035 targets, 
in line with the ISES to 2035 as described above. 
The most crucial laws and regulations behind this

 schemes
Within the regulatory framework described 
above, the following schemes are applied for the 
implementation of renewable energy projects in 
Egypt:
Competitive bidding
In the early 1990s, the NREA started the competitive 
bidding process for renewable electricity generating 
capacity for government projects. In 2009, EETC 
launched the first auctions for large-scale private 
projects using the BOO scheme where the NREA 
secured the land and data on resources. In the 
following years, a number of other tenders were 
launched by EETC: 200 MW of solar PV in 2013; 
250 MW wind, 200 MW solar PV and 100 MW CSP 
in 2015 (Eversheds and PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
2016).
As a result of the declining cost of renewable 
energy sources, in 2017 Egypt moved to the auction 
mechanism (competitive bidding) for large-scale 
solar and wind projects. Auctions for large-scale 
solar PV projects were announced, to be carried out 
under state-owned EPC contracts with the NREA, 
or under a BOO scheme with an IPP through PPA 
agreements with EETC. In this regard, EETC issued 
a tender for a 600 MW of PV capacity in the West 
of Nile area in December 2017.
BOO scheme with PPAs
As of July 2015, the IPP scheme was adopted by 
the Egyptian power sector and EgyptERA issued 
the relevant regulations and contracts to provide 
developers with the necessary level of certainty. 
The generated electricity is sold directly to either 
the end users or the distribution utilities depending 
on the scale of the consumer. In the situation where 
surplus electricity is generated, it is consumed to 
satisfy the developer’s own electricity demand (EU, 
2015a). The IPP scheme alleviates upfront costs 
for project development and ensures continuous 
investment due to increased competition.
EETC has announced bidding processes for wind, 
solar PV and CSP projects with a total capacity of 
more than 1 000 MW through the BOO scheme in 
Gulf El Zayt, including consortiums with Italgen, 
Lakela and Engie-I (EEHC, 2016b). In addition, 
100 MW of CSP and 1 000 MW of solar PV projects 
under three competitive bidding schemes, as well 
as a 600 MW project under direct negotiation, have 
all been approved by the Cabinet.
The aforementioned 600 MW solar PV BOO plant 
will be completed under direct negotiation and was 
approved by the Cabinet in December 2017. In this 
context, EETC will be the off-taker of electricity 
under the usufruct agreement with the NREA for a 
project lifetime of 25 years (Eversheds Sutherland, 
2017). 
As Egypt continues to develop tenders under the 
auction scheme through either private or public 
finance and ownership, to ensure an effective 
use of this tool the NREA and EETC would 
benefit from adopting the guidelines in IRENA’s 
Renewable Energy Auctions publication (IRENA 
and CEM, 2015). The report provides elaborated 
context-specific design scenarios, with in-depth 
analysis of capacity- and energy- driven auctions, 
while highlighting country-specific best practice 
examples. IRENA’s guidelines can further aid EETC 
in developing and evaluating the technical and 
financial specifications for upcoming projects, such 
as the current 200 MW PV facility at Kom Ombo. 
Auctions are an effective policy tool to aid Egypt 
in achieving its 2022 and 2035 targets in a costeffective manner.More than 70 countries had adopted auctions to procure renewables by the end of 2016. 
(IRENA, IEA and REN21, 2018; and IRENA, 2017g). 
The widespread adoption of auctions reflects their proven effectiveness in expanding 
renewable energy deployment, particularly in developing countries, often at record-breaking 
prices due to heightened competition. Auctions have allowed for real-time price discovery and 
reduced information asymmetry between the public sector and private finance from investors 
and developers. The 2015 guidebook on the design of auctions analyses the design elements, 
provides elaborated context-specific design scenarios and highlights country-specific best 
practice examples, thus bringing down the cost of renewable energy technologies (IRENA, 
2017h; IRENA and CEM, 2015). 
Auctions have led to record-low prices globally, including countries in the Middle East and North 
Africa. In 2016, Morocco awarded wind contracts at an average of USD 30 per megawatt hour 
(MWh), while the United Arab Emirates (Abu Dhabi emirate) achieved an average of USD 24.2 
per MWh for solar PV. However, the factors behind the prices achieved in different markets 
are important to note. Auction prices reflect a combination of country-specific conditions (e.g. 
resource availability and cost of land, labour, finance), investor confidence, other renewable 
energy support policies (e.g. tax incentives, policies supporting a local industry) and the design 
of the auction itself (IRENA, 2017h).
Auctions have also gained popularity in different contexts in recent years owing to their 
flexibility of design. They can be tailored to the country-specific context and objectives. For 
example, auctions can be designed in a way as to maximise socio-economic benefits. Policy 
makers have realised the potential benefits of auctions in job creation and enhanced local 
content. In South Africa, auctions have been coupled with local content requirements to 
support the development of local industry. Auction requirements have allowed the country to 
increase its manufacturing capability from a minimal level of local content in the first round 
to around 45% in the fourth round for various renewable energy technologies (IRENA, 2017h).
Box 1: 
The rise of renewable
energy auctions FIT scheme
Consistent with creating a supportive environment 
for renewable energy applications, on 17 September 
2014 the government approved a FIT scheme to 
encourage investment in electricity generation from 
renewable energy resources, particularly wind and 
solar, with the active engagement of the private 
sector in market development.
The FIT scheme aims to mobilise investment to 
achieve a total of 4 300 MW capacity over the 
period 2014-2018, including:
• 300 MW of small PV installations of less than 
500 kW
• 2 000 MW of PV installations with a capacity 
ranging from 500 kW to 50 MW
• 2 000 MW of wind installations with a capacity 
ranging from 20 MW to 50 MW.
The second phase of the FIT scheme was announced 
by the Prime Minister’s Decree No. 2532 dated 
30 September 2016 and was implemented as of 
27 October 2016. The duration of related PPAs 
was set at 25 years for PV projects and 20 years 
for wind projects. EgyptERA has put in place the 
required regulations and procedures for executing 
the relevant projects.
To ensure the bankability of the PPAs, under this 
second phase a greater share of the tariffs for wind 
and solar will be pegged to the fixed exchange 
rate of EGP 8.88/USD. The FIT for PV projects with 
installed capacities of greater than 500 kW will be 
charged in Egyptian pounds, such that 30% of solar 
PV project tariffs are based on today’s pegged rate 
as against 15% during the first phase (exchange rate 
EGP 7.15/USD), while for wind projects the share of 
tariffs is 40%, as elaborated on in further detail in 
Tables 12 and 13.

prices for PV projects and wind projects at selected 
numbers of operating hours.
The prices under the second phase of the FIT will 
only apply to those who have qualified from the 
first phase and for contracts signed on or after 
28 October 2016. Financial closure was set at one 
year after signing for PV projects, 28 October 2017, 
while for wind projects, financial closure was set at 
18 months, 28 April 2018.
Status of FIT implementation
For phase one, two developers of large-scale PV 
systems were able to achieve financial closure, while 
for phase two, 30 companies are close to obtaining 
their financial closure for their PV projects with total 
capacity of 1 465 MW by October 2017.10 They have

Distributed PV systems are mostly implemented by 
local companies that are representatives of foreign 
ones. Over 220 companies are licensed by the 
NREA, while only around ten of them are active in 
the field. The total capacity that has been installed 
on the basis of the FIT stands at about 1.7 MW, while 
those under installation may reach 12.4 MW.
The reason behind the limited total installed 
capacity is that the net metering scheme has 
yet to be effectively applied and FIT prices were 
insufficiently attractive for potential investors. This 
is supported by the fact that many have installed 
systems without relying on the FIT, instead relying 
on self-consumption. This has proved to be more 
beneficial to such users, as it cuts their consumption Table 16. Land assigned for renewable energy projects

Egypt’s shift to the auctions scheme will allow for 
further price declines and could potentially drive
enhanced local content and job creation.
Other support mechanisms
The Prime Ministerial Decree No. (37/4/15/14) of 
2015 was issued to allocate land for renewable 
energy projects through usufruct rights. In line 
with the decree, the government assigned about 
7 600 km2 in the Gulf of Suez, east and west of the 
Nile, Benban and Kom Ombo regions, of which 
about 5 700 km2 are for wind projects (75% share) 
and about 1 900 km2 for solar energy projects 
(25% share), as shown in Table 16.
T&D utilities are committed to offering priority 
dispatch for renewable electricity. In addition, 
an attractive mechanism has been developed to 
encourage the purchase of renewable electricity 
through the setting of tariffs for each category of 
consumption. Moreover, the applied customs on 
components and spare parts for the projects have 
been set at a discounted rate of 2% compared to 
the prior 5%, with a VAT rate currently set at 5% 
rather than 14%.
The following additional incentives complement the 
FIT implementation:
1. Provision of sovereign guarantees to projects 
above 20 MW that are awarded under PPAs 
between EETC, the MOF and IPPs.
2. Provision of soft loans at 4% interest rate for 
residential projects up to 200 kW, and up to 
8% interest rate for projects ranging between 
200 kW and 500 kW.
3. A decision to make EGP 2 billion investment 
for strengthening T&D grids to enable the 
transition towards smart grids.
In further support of renewable energy schemes, 
EETC proposed and discussed with both the 
NREA and EgyptERA a transmission code for the 
interconnection of wind projects. The code was 
approved by EgyptERA, in addition to the rules 
and regulations for the interconnection of solar PV 
systems with the low- and medium-voltage networks.3.6 Policies to maximise local 
 benefits
The deployment of renewable energy in Egypt 
presents considerable opportunities for socioeconomic benefits and local value creation. Besides 
increasing energy security, enhancing energy access 
and mitigating climate change, renewable energy 
projects present opportunities along different 
segments of the value chain, including the sourcing 
of raw materials, manufacturing and assembly of 
components, construction and installation, and 
O&M. Building on its established wind market, 
Egypt’s electricity sector has successfully localised 
30% of overall wind farm requirements. A target of 
70% by 2020 has been established, along with 50% 
for CSP plants.
For solar PV, only 30% of installed costs are spent 
on modules (and 10% on inverters) and the rest 
is on the balance of system. As such, 60% can be 
localised just through the balance of system which 
comprises construction works, mounting structures, 
cabling, etc. Following the installation of the project, 
considerable value is created in O&M.
As for manufacturing, Egypt has the potential to 
meet a local manufacturing content of more than 
80% (EIB and IRENA, 2015). Egypt is considered 
an industrial leader in the Middle East and African 
markets, and it can leverage its mature steel, 
glass and cable industries to produce solar and 
wind components locally. For example, the three 
international float glass companies active in 
Egypt, Saint Gobain, Sphinx and Guardian, all have 
production facilities that can produce high-purity 
silica sand used for different industries including 
PV module production (EIB and IRENA, 2015). In 
parallel, Egyptian steel companies can supply the 
necessary support structures for modules.
Moreover, Egypt can advance its technical and 
human capabilities through policies that facilitate 
foreign domestic investments and joint ventures 
with multinational companies. For example, 
SWEG (Elsewedy for Wind Energy Generation) is 
generating local jobs through joint ventures in wind 
turbine and tower manufacturing and the production 
of cables and transformers (ElsewedyElectric, 
2018). For onshore wind, one incentive for local 
manufacturing of bulky parts such as blades and 
towers is their high cost of transport and lower 
need for technological advancement11.
Egypt produces half the components for its wind farms
Photograph: ShutterstockIn designing policies to support value creation from the development of a domestic renewable 
energy industry, a deeper understanding of the requirements for labour, skills, materials and 
equipment is needed.
For solar PV, IRENA analysis shows that 56% of the total jobs are in O&M, 22% are created 
in manufacturing and 17% are in installation and grid connection. A large percentage of jobs 
created are for factory workers and technicians, which could help to alleviate unemployment in 
Egypt. Moreover, administrative, finance, legal and engineering jobs are created, which could 
be promising for college or university graduates struggling to find employment.
For wind, the bulk of the jobs created are in O&M (43%), installation and grid connection 
(30%), followed by manufacturing (17%). Notably, while jobs in manufacturing and installation 
are temporary, those created in O&M last throughout the lifetime of the project.

DecommBased on: IRENA (2017a), Renewable Energy Benefits: Leveraging Local Capacity for Onshore Wind.
The successful deployment of renewable energy 
depends on the existence of a workforce capable 
of undertaking activities through training and 
education policies. Since the mid-1990s, the NREA 
has organised and conducted a variety of training 
programmes on renewable energy resource 
assessments, technologies and applications for 
Egyptian, Arab and African groups. As of October 
2017, the number of trainees exceeded 5 000, with 
individuals originating from universities and other 
Egyptian organisations to those from member 
countries of the Regional Center for Renewable 
Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE) and African 
countries. In the area of capacity building, the NREA 
conducted training for engineers and technicians 
for the newly established PV companies to obtain 
certification under the FIT regulation in accordance 
with both national and international standards.
Another initiative is the RENAC-OASIS Solar 
Academy Egypt (ROSAE), a partnership between 
the Renewables Academy (RENAC), Germany, and 
Oasis Renewable Energy (ORE). It has provided 
practically orientated training courses and capacity 
building in renewable energy for decision makers, 
consultants, engineers, installers and technicians 
since 2010.12 Most recently, in 2018, the government 
launched a renewable energy curriculum at technical 
schools to encourage specialisation in renewable 
energy and training in solar and wind. The threeyear certificate programme was developed by the 
Egyptian Ministry of Education and the US Agency 
for International Development (USAID) and aims to 
train over 300 technical school students.13
3.7 Testing and certification
Since the establishment of the NREA in 1986, a set 
of indoor and outdoor testing laboratories has been 
in operation, covering most renewable energy and 
energy efficiency technology components, including 
laboratories for testing SWHs, solar concentrators, 
PV panels, system components, biomass digesters 
and gasifiers.
The NREA certifies SWHs, home appliances 
(refrigerators, washing machines, air-conditioning 
units, dishwashers) and lighting equipment for 
local manufacturers, as well as for the importers 
of equipment. The laboratories have an impact on 
the quality of equipment placed on the market and 
protect it from low-quality systems.RENEWABLE 
ENERGY 
OUTLOOKThe previous chapters have outlined the energy context in Egypt, and provided 
a view on how the country’s energy landscape is likely to evolve over the coming 
years based on government plans and targets and the country’s energy strategy, 
ISES to 2035. However, Egypt’s energy system is highly dynamic and the 
government would benefit from periodically re-evaluating longer-term energy 
goals to reflect changing market dynamics and priorities for the country.
Whereas the RRA approach focuses on analysing existing policy and institutional 
frameworks, IRENA’s REmap analysis provides an outlook on the medium-term 
potential of renewable energy in the country. This REmap component, presented 
in this chapter, also highlights areas or sectors where the use of renewables could 
be scaled up.
The chapter focuses first on briefly presenting developments that are likely to 
occur in what is termed the Reference Case, which is based on current policies, 
market trends and forecasts. Next the chapter goes into depth on the accelerated 
potential of renewable energy beyond what is expected to occur in the Reference 
Case. These are called the REmap Options, addressing the end-use sectors of 
industry, buildings and transport, as well as power generation. The resulting highrenewables case is called the REmap Case.
The REmap analysis looks out to the year 2030, chosen as the standard assessment 
timeframe for REmap due to it being in the medium term, a common year for 
global efforts such as the Sustainable Development Goals, and a common year in 
Egypt for many national-level targets (for 2029/30). For more information about 
the REmap approach, methodology and sources, please see Annex II.
04Figure 22. Overview of REmap years and case descriptions
The steps to conduct the REmap analysis for Egypt 
that are presented in this chapter include the 
following:
A Reference Case to 2030 is developed based 
on the scenario results from the National Energy 
Model as presented in the report for Technical 
Assistance to Support the Reform of the Energy 
Sector for Egypt (TARES) (EU, 2015c). The result 
of the Reference Case presented here is a view of 
a baseline scenario, not specifically the ISES. This 
case represents possible developments in the 
energy system provided the government does not 
take additional measures to support renewable 
energy deployment.
Additional renewable energy deployment options 
are then subsequently assessed. These are called 
the REmap Options and are based in part on country 
consultation, including analysis from an Egyptian 
energy expert from NREA loaned to IRENA to 
support the project and help in the identification 
of these options, and a validation workshop with 
Egyptian experts. Additionally, the TARES results for 
Scenarios 3b and 4 and IRENA analysis were also 
used (see Annex II for more information on sourcing).
The result of this options analysis is the REmap 
Case, which details the accelerated potential of 
renewables and what it would imply in terms of 
technological developments, costs and benefits. 
Importantly, the REmap Case also provides a view 
on where the additional potential of renewable 
energy outside the power sector lies, i.e. in the enduse sectors of buildings, industry and transport, and 
for energy services related to heat, fuels and other 
direct uses.
Finally, fuel prices were forecast based on existing 
literature and IRENA estimates, and technology cost 
and performance criteria (e.g. capacity factors) were 
estimated to reflect conditions particular to Egypt. 
The results of these options are then quantified in 
terms of their costs, investment needs, and benefits 
resulting from lower levels of air pollution, CO2
emissions, and other impacts.
Figure 22 provides an overview of the key cases 
discussed in this chapter and the years that are 
highlighted.

Milestones4.1 Reference Case
The Reference Case represents a perspective 
on energy supply and demand under a baseline 
scenario. This case represents likely developments 
in the energy market provided the government does 
not act to support the goals set out in the ISES. For 
the analysis, the Reference Case is based on the 
energy demand and supply scenario results from the 
TARES report (EU, 2015c), specifically the Baseline 
Scenario. However, the Reference Case has also been 
adjusted based on country feedback through direct 
consultation and during the validation workshop 
held in mid-2017. The Reference Case, therefore, 
reflects a baseline scenario view as of late 2017 – any 
new policies or development that have occurred past 
this date will not be reflected in the case.
The result is a Reference Case that provides a 
baseline off which the more aggressive renewable 
energy targets set forth in the ISES, and detailed 
in the REmap Case, can be quantified. Provided no 
supportive action is taken, the Reference Case is 
the case that potentially would occur given current 
market and policy developments in Egypt. Even 
if Egypt is firmly committed to achieving more 
assertive renewables goals, the Reference Case 
view is necessary as it allows the REmap Options 
assessment to provide a gap analysis and view on 
what key technologies will need to be supported to 
reach those goals, while allowing quantification of 
those technologies in terms of their costs, benefits 
and other impacts.
This chapter does not go into detail on specific 
developments in the Reference Case. However, 
some key changes in energy and economic 
indicators are discussed, and key shares and energy 
developments in the Reference Case are looked
at in the sections that follow.
Economic and energy demand 
developments
• In the Reference Case, over the period 2014-
2030, demand for energy increases by 117%. 
Fossil fuel consumption increases slightly 
less, by 92%. Demand for energy increases at 
a pace similar to overall GDP growth, which 
increases by 119% over the period, indicating 
no decoupling of energy demand growth and 
economic growth.
• The resulting growth in fossil fuel consumption 
sees increased imports of coal, natural gas 
and oil. The corresponding increase in energyrelated CO2
 is over 126%, and external costs 
relating to air pollution from fossil fuels increase 
by 117% to a range of USD 13-53 billion annually 
by 2030.
Egypt is projected to see robust economic growth 
to 2030, with GDP increases averaging around 
4% per year over the period. The result is an 
increase in GDP of 119% by 2030. Primary energy 
supply increases by 117%, from 62 Mtoe in 2014 to
133 Mtoe by 2030 (Figure 23). Demand for fossil 
fuels grows by 92%, with natural gas increasing 
the least at just 8%. Demand for oil products 
increases by 60% and coal’s overall importance 
rises significantly with the emergence of 53 Mtoe 
of coal demand, up from below 1 Mtoe in 2014.
The Reference Case foresees GDP increases that 
are equal to growth in energy demand, with both 
increasing by around 120% to 2030; this points to no 
noticeable improvement in the energy intensity of 
the country’s economy in the Reference Case, which 
indicates significant potential for improvements in 
energy efficiency in the country.Energy-related CO2
 emissions increase from 
156 million tonnes (Mt) in 2014 to 354 Mt in 2030 – 
the largest increase of any indicator. This is driven 
by the significant growth in fossil fuel use, and 
outpaces total growth in TPES due to the emergence 
of coal power generation. The largest source of 
energy-related CO2 is the power generation sector 
at 157 Mt, followed by industry at 78 Mt.
The greater use of coal brings with it not just 
higher CO2 emissions, but also increased levels of 
air pollution. Additionally, the 63% increase in the 
use of oil, much of it in urban areas for transport, 
is particularly harmful due to its effects on local 
air pollution. Therefore, external costs relating to 
air pollution from fossil fuels – largely made up of 
adverse effects on human health –increase by 117% 
to 2030. Annual air pollution costs increase from 
a range of USD 6-25 billion in 2015, to a range of 
USD13-53 billion by 2030. Most of the increases 
come from higher use of fossil fuels, in particular oil 
in transport, but also coal used in power generation.
Consequently, the overall picture of development 
in the Reference Case to 2030 shows that Egypt 
can expect significant growth in energy demand 
and the associated external costs that come with 
meeting that demand with fossil fuels.
One is that growth in power generation capacity 
has outpaced demand for electricity. In 2017, power 
system capacity reached 45 GW, while maximum 
load during peak summer demand was in the order 
of 31 GW. Additionally, there have been recent 
discoveries of natural gas in deep-water fields. 
Both of these developments may influence energyrelated policy making in the near term that could 
affect the Reference Case.
Renewable share and technology 
developments
• The share of renewables increases in all sectors 
in the Reference Case by 2030 except in the 
industrial sector. The largest increase in renewable 
share is in power generation. In the end-use 
sectors, the use of fuels and other direct uses of 
energy for thermal and transport uses see little or 
no change in renewable share. Overall, the share 
of renewable energy in TFEC grows from 5% in 
2014 to 11% in the Reference Case.
• The only sizeable contributions of renewable 
sources in the Reference Case occur in the power 
sector. This sector sees total system capacity 
increase by over 250% to 117 GW, with growth 
in coal, natural gas, wind and solar PV. In the 
Reference Case both wind power and solar PV

Note: End-use sector shares (industry, transport and buildings) show the share of renewable energy in each sector’s energy demand 
In the Reference Case the share of renewables 
increases in all sectors except in the industrial sector 
(see Table 17); however, the only sizeable increase is 
in the power sector. Overall the renewables share 
in TFEC doubles to 11%. The renewable share of 
power generation increases from 9% to 25%; this 
increase is impressive given that the increase in 
gross electricity generation is around 125% to 
385 terawatt hours (TWh). Therefore, renewable 
power generation increases from just 15 TWh 
(almost all of it hydropower) to 96 TWh by 2030 
in the Reference Case. Total power system capacity 
increases by over 250% to 117 GW in 2030.
In the end-use sectors of buildings, industry 
and transport, the renewable share of fuels and 
direct uses of energy for thermal applications and 
transport sees little or no change (see Table 17). 
Industry has the highest renewable share of the 
three end-use sectors, with 10% in 2030, and sees 
small increases in bioenergy use in the Reference 
Case. However, due to the overall growth in energy 
demand in industry, the renewables share decreases 
from 11% to 10% over the period.
In the transport sector the share increases to 2% by 
2030 due to the emergence of some liquid biofuels, 
but their contribution is minor compared to overall 
sector energy use, which is still dominated by oil. The 
buildings sector sees an increase in its renewable 
share from under 1% to around 1.5%, due to some 
growth in solar thermal for hot water and biogas 
for cooking. These shares all exclude electricity use. 
If the sectors are analysed including the share of 
renewable electricity consumed in them, the overall 
renewable share increases due to the fact that the 
proportion of renewables in electricity generation 
is significantly higher, at 25%, than the renewable 
proportion of fuels.
The power sector sees significant additions of 
generation capacity in the Reference Case. Over
20 GW of new capacity for each of coal and natural 
gas are installed, 18 GW of wind, and 9 GW of solar 
PV (see Figure 24).Figure 24. Selected fossil and renewable energy supply developments
in 2014 and in the Reference Case in 2030
Fuel demand growth is significant in the transport 
sector, increasing by 93%. Oil products remain the 
dominant fuel source, supplying around 98% of the 
sector’s energy needs in 2030. Of the remaining 
2%, liquid biofuels provide the largest proportion, 
largely bioethanol from sugarcane.
The industrial sector sees the largest increase in 
energy demand of any end-use sector, with almost 
150% growth. Fossil fuel demand in the sector more 
than doubles, with a mix of coal, natural gas and oil 
products, and the sector sees a slight increase in the 
use of renewable energy due to the combustion of 
biomass residues, driven by the growing output of 
biomass processing industries such as sugarcane. 
Biogas from biomass processing wastes also 
contributes to the increase in renewable energy share.
Finally, the buildings sector sees a 135% increase 
in energy demand, and a very small increase in 
renewable energy use from limited solar thermal for 
hot water and biogas facilities for cooking.
4.2 REmap Case – accelerating 
 renewable energy
This section discusses the REmap Case, which is an 
assessment of the accelerated potential of renewable 
and sources that have additional potential to be 
utilised or deployed on top of developments in the 
Reference Case. This section’s main aim, therefore, is 
to outline where the additional potential of renewable 
energy lies in Egypt, both in meeting the aims of the 
ISES and also increasing renewables even further.
The REmap Options explore the potential to 
increase renewables across all sectors of Egypt’s 
energy system – it uses a mixed approach aimed 
at maximising renewable energy deployment 
and looks at options in power, thermal, transport 
and cooking applications. It also quantifies the 
renewable options in terms of their costs, benefits 
and investment needs. More information on the 
approach to determining the REmap Options and 
sources is available in Annex II.
Drivers for renewable energy
The REmap Options identify areas across Egypt’s 
entire energy system where additional potential 
for using renewable energy lies. The criteria for 
selecting these options are not based solely on cost, 
but also on additional motivating factors that incline 
governments to support increased deployment of 
renewable energy technologies. These factors can 
include efforts to improve energy security, promote

renewables are in many cases the least-cost option 
for energy supply in Egypt. The cost case is even 
more appealing when considering benefits that arise 
from reduced air pollution and CO2 emissions. As the 
costing section shows, the grouping of technologies 
identified in REmap not only reduce energy system 
costs as a whole – meaning lower overall energy 
costs for consumers – but also result in at least twice 
as many savings from reduced external costs due 
to lower levels of air pollution and environmental 
damage.
Fossil fuels carry price volatility risk, particularly 
where they are imported. Valuing this risk is difficult, 
but should be considered when evaluating energy 
system investments. The renewables identified in 
this section either have no fuel price volatility (such 
as for solar, wind or hydro resources), or in the case 
of bioenergy are based largely on the local agroeconomy, which generally affords government more 
control over the market and certainty on how costs 
will develop over time.
Subsequently, energy security and diversification are 
a key driver of Egypt’s energy policies. According to 
Egypt’s ISES, the import dependence rate for fossil 
fuels reached 10% in 2014/15, and in the reference 
case scenario from that report, which is the basis 
of the Reference Case of this report, the share is 
expected to reach 50% in 2034/35. This indicates the 
crucial need for Egypt to enhance and expedite its 
efforts for the development of both energy efficiency 
and renewable energy.
The sections that follow go into more depth on 
what additional potential is available, in which 
technologies and sectors. They also quantify those 
technologies and sources in terms of their costs, 
benefits and investment needs.
Summary of REmap findings
• In the REmap Case the share of renewables 
increases across all sectors, with the largest 
increase in the power sector. Overall, renewable 
energy can provide 22% of Egypt’s energy 
supply in TFEC in 2030, up from just 5% in 2014. 
Renewables in TFEC increase from 3.2 Mtoe in 
2014 to 11.5 Mtoe in the Reference Case and to 
21.7 Mtoe in the REmap Case by 2030 – a 600% 
increase in absolute terms over 2014.
• The renewable power mix moves from one 
dominated by hydroelectricity to a much more 
diverse mix of technologies that includes sizeable 
generation from solar PV, CSP and wind. While 
power generation from natural gas remains the 
largest generation source, the second-largest is 
solar PV, followed by wind and CSP. In the REmap 
Case by 2030, 53% of generation is supplied from 
renewable sources, a doubling over the share in 
the Reference Case and up from 9% in 2014.
• Renewables use in the end-use sectors is also 
important in the REmap findings, with around 
10% of fuel use in all end-use sectors being met 
by renewables, including bioenergy and solar 
thermal.
• The REmap analysis identifies additional 
renewable energy potential across all sectors 
of the Egyptian energy landscape. However, the 
analysis shows that the largest potential, and 
where the largest growth occurs, is in the power 
sector. The power sector sees significant growth 
due to untapped potential, particularly for solar 
PV and CSP, but also for wind power. In both the 
Reference Case and the REmap Case, the share 
of renewable energy in TFEC that comes from 
renewable power is around two-thirds, with the 
remainder largely being renewable fuels and 
other direct uses in industry.
Overall, renewable energy can provide 22% of 
Egyptian TFEC, doubling the share in the Reference 
Case and up from just 5% in 2014 (see Table 18). At the 
sector level, the largest share is in the power sector 
where over half of electricity comes from renewable 
sources. Across the end-use sectors the share of 
renewable energy in fuels and direct uses varies from 
9% to 12% (i.e. the share of sector energy excluding 
electricity). If end-use sectors also include electricity 
consumed in them, then the renewable share in 
each sector would be higher, at 19% in industry, 11% 
in transport, and 35% in buildings. The reason these 
shares increase when including electricity is because 
over half of the electricity supplied is renewable.Type of energy use

Table 18. Renewable energy shares in 2030 given different cases for growth of renewables 
Note: End-use sector shares (industry, transport and buildings) show the share of renewable energy in each sector’s energy demand 
excluding electricity, i.e. fuels and other direct uses of energy. “Modern” refers to the share of modern renewable energy consumed in the 
buildings sector and overall energy (TFEC, TPES). Modern renewable energy is defined as including all forms of renewable energy except 
traditional uses of bioenergy (a notable part of energy use in the buildings sector).
Looking at how these percentages translate 
into energy supply when viewed in final energy 
terms, several key findings are evident, as seen in
Figure 25. Renewable power generation sees 
its relative importance grow, from making up 
around one-third of renewable energy consumed 
in 2014 to over two-thirds in REmap in 2030. The 
renewable power mix also changes, moving from 
one dominated by hydroelectricity to a much 
more diverse mix of technologies that includes 
the majority of generation coming from solar PV, 
CSP and wind. In fact, while power generation from 
natural gas remains the largest generation source, 
the second-largest is solar PV, followed by wind and 
CSP. Overall, renewable power generation in the 
country increases over tenfold, from just 16 TWh in 
2014 to 186 TWh in REmap in 2030.
Despite the significant potential of renewable 
power, however, renewable energy use must also 
be considered in buildings, industry and transport. 
In these end-use sectors, energy is needed in the 
terms these energy needs make up just under threequarters of energy demand, and in primary energy 
terms they make up around 60% of energy demand. 
Therefore, a holistic view of energy is needed, 
taking account of the potential of renewables for 
heat, fuels and other direct uses.
Despite Egypt’s arid environment, bioenergy is still 
an important source in end-use energy applications 
due to its ability to be used for heat and transport 
fuel. Bioenergy is the primary renewable source 
for heat and fuels in the end-use sectors in 2014, 
and remains so in the Reference Case. In REmap 
additional potential for bioenergy has been 
identified and is detailed in more depth in the sector 
discussions later in this chapter. In the REmap Case 
bioenergy accounts for around 5% of TFEC in 2030, 
an increase from 3.5% in the Reference Case in 
2030 and 2.5% in 2014.
Solar thermal is also an important source of 
renewable energy in the end-use sectors of but also in subsectors including tourism and 
commercial uses. In industry, solar thermal systems 
can provide low-temperature heat and pre-heating 
or other process heat uses. The Reference Case 
does see a slight increase in solar thermal systems 
in the buildings sector, providing, however, just 
0.6% of sector energy. In the REmap Case sizeable 
additional potential has been identified, raising the 
share of buildings sector energy supply met with 
solar thermal to 2.7%, and introducing limited solar 
thermal in industry able to provide around 1.5% of 
sector energy.
The REmap Options also consider electrification 
technologies, largely in transport in the form of 
electric mobility and in the buildings sector for 
cooking and water heating needs. Electrification in 
Egypt also makes sense given the strong renewable 
power resources available in the country.
In total, the amount of modern renewable energy 
used in Egypt increases from 3.2 Mtoe in 2014 to 
11.5 Mtoe in the Reference Case, and increases 
further to 21.7 Mtoe in REmap in 2030 – more than 
600% above the 2014 level. This would lead to a 
quadrupling of the share of modern renewables in 
TFEC from 5% in 2014 to 22% in REmap.
Further developments by case are presented in 
Table 19. The table shows how power capacity and 
generation develop from 2014 to 2030 in both the 
Reference Case and REmap Case. It also details 
how the use of fuels and direct uses of energy in 
both the industrial and buildings sectors change, 
with specific focus on solar thermal and bioenergy. 
In transport it outlines how liquid biofuel supply 
develops, as well as electric mobility. It also outlines 
how the renewable energy shares change over the 
various cases. Finally, the table presents several key 
financial indicators. The sections that follow go into 
detail to explain how these developments occur 
at a sector level, and discuss in more detail what 
the costs and benefits are that arise from greater 
renewables deployment.

Notes: BEV = battery electric vehicle; BF/CO = blast furnace and coke ovens; N/A = =not applicable; yr = year.Bioenergy accounts for a small share of Egypt’s TFEC. Analysis based on a literature survey 
indicates that around to 2 000 ktoe of bioenergy was used in the country in 2014, which 
represents a little over 3% of TPES. IRENA statistics show a slightly higher value in 2015, at 
around 3 500 ktoe. The residential sector alone accounts for around 40% of the bioenergy use, 
mostly for cooking and heating. Most of that bioenergy is solid biomass in the form of agricultural 
residues, with some woodfuel and charcoal use. The remaining 60% is used in industry, where 
solid biomass is relevant in the food industry and the cement sector. In the food industry, the 
sugarcane sector is the most relevant where bagasse is used in co generation plants to supply 
the industry’s internal heat and power needs.
In the cement sector, a little over 6% of thermal energy needs are supplied by so-called alternative 
fuels that include biomass, such as agricultural wastes (rice straw, cotton stalks, maize straw), 
dried sewage sludge and refuse-derived fuel (RDF), which is partly biomass in the form of 
the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (IFC, 2016). The use of bioenergy is negligible in 
transport and electricity generation.
Despite the limited use of bioenergy in Egypt and considering the restrictions imposed by land 
and water scarcity, some potential exists for growth in bioenergy use. The use of agricultural 
residues currently left in the field or burnt in an uncontrolled manner is one significant source of 
biomass resources that can be tapped. This would not only help improve bioenergy availability, 
but also mitigate local air pollution from the emissions produced during uncontrolled burning. 
Livestock wastes are another source, including animal and chicken manure. Also, the waste 
management sector could contribute to a greater extent, by incorporating energy recovery 
solutions into municipal solid waste disposal and wastewater treatment. In fact, the current use 
of RDF and dried sewage sludge in cement plants is an important step in that direction. Finally, 
there is the opportunity to develop dedicated energy crops in desert land, using reclaimed 
wastewater for irrigation. The analysis of different biomass sources from a literature survey 
indicates the existence of the following potential today:
• Agricultural residues: around 9 million dry-tonnes, which correspond to 3 250 ktoe/year, 
in the form mainly of rice straw and husks, corn stover, sugarcane straw and bagasse, and 
cotton stalks (based on FAO, 2017). This is additional potential supply, above current uses.
• Municipal solid waste: around 20 Mt per year, which translates to 3 820 ktoe/year (based on 
GIZ, 2014).
• Sludge from wastewater treatment plants: around 1 Mt per year, or 335 ktoe/year (based on 
Ghazy et al., 2011, and Said et al., 2013).
• Livestock manure: 120-240 ktoe if converted to biogas (based on UNDP/GEF, 2008).
• In addition, there is the potential for dedicated crops grown on reclaimed desert land using 
Box 3: 
Potential for
bioenergy growth These estimates could translate conservatively into over 4 700 ktoe/year of bioenergy in the 
end-use and electricity generation sectors, which would more than double current bioenergy 
deployment. Said et al. (2013), for instance, estimate a significantly higher technical potential, 
equal to 9 960 ktoe/year.
One of the main challenges to realising such potential is development of adequate biomass 
supply chains. Most of the industrial facilities that can potentially use biomass for process heat 
and/or power generation are large-scale, centralised plants operating at economies of scale that 
require large energy flows to be brought from within and across national borders.
Consequently, the development of biomass supply chains has to be supported to ensure the 
delivery of reliable, high-quality and affordable biomass fuels to those industries that are willing 
to use biomass, while at the same time diversifying income streams for local farms without 
introducing potential risks. The development of such supply chains could benefit multiple users 
of different parts of the biomass feedstock.
Power sector
• Electricity generation more than doubles 
between 2014 and 2030. Renewable electricity 
generation grows significantly in both the 
Reference Case and REmap with large additions 
of solar PV, CSP and wind. The overall renewable 
energy share in power generation reaches 53% 
in REmap in 2030, doubling the 25% share in 
the Reference Case, and significantly higher 
than the 9% share in 2014.
• Power system capacity increases from 33 GW 
in 2014 to 117 GW in the Reference Case, and 
further to 137 GW in REmap. Natural gas 
remains the largest source of power capacity 
and generation; however, in REmap the secondlargest is solar PV, followed by wind and CSP.
The power sector in Egypt sees significant changes 
by 2030. Electricity demand grows by almost 125% 
to over 385 TWh per year in the Reference Case. 
Over 80% of that increase is due to higher demand 
from the buildings sector, resulting from a growing 
population and demand for cooling and domestic 
appliances. To meet this growing demand, Egypt 
is exploring a wide range of technologies, from 
conventional to renewable.
Renewable power generation grows significantly in 
both the Reference Case and REmap Case. As can 
in 2030, doubling the 25% share in the Reference 
Case and significantly higher than the 9% in 2014. 
The growth already occurring in the Reference Case 
is encouraging and points to the strong renewable 
resource availably in the country. However, the 
REmap Options show that significantly higher 
deployment of renewables could take place.
Power system capacity increases from 33 GW in 
2014 to 117 GW in the Reference Case, and further to 
137 GW in REmap. Natural gas remains the largest 
source of power capacity and generation; however, 
in REmap the second-largest is solar PV, followed 
by wind and CSP. The increase in system capacity in 
REmap is due not only to increased electrification 
in end uses, such as electric vehicles (EVs), but 
also to the lower capacity factor of solar and wind 
compared to conventional power plants, thereby 
necessitating more installed capacity.
The renewable power additions occurring between 
2014 and 2030 differ between the Reference Case 
and the REmap Case (see Figure 26). The Reference 
Case sees over half of new renewable power 
generation come from wind, with the remainder 
split between solar PV and CSP, whereas in REmap 
the bulk of new generation is from solar PV. Under 
REmap, roughly half of the renewable power 
additions over the period come from solar PV. Total 
renewable power generation increases from 16 TWh Figure 26. Power sector renewable shares and generation, 2014, 2030
Under REmap, the largest new power source is solar 
PV, with 35 GW of additions on top of the 9 GW 
occurring in the Reference Case.
Wind power sees the largest additions in the 
Reference Case, with a total of 18 GW installed by 
2030; additions from the REmap Options of 3 GW 
result in a total of 21 GW in the REmap Case in 2030. 
CSP grows by 4 GW in the Reference Case and a 
further 4 GW under REmap Options; however, the 
REmap Options see CSP additions that are largely 
coupled with storage.
Natural gas remains the largest generation source, 
and is subject to strong growth in the Reference 
Case, with additional capacity of around 20 GW.
The Reference Case also demonstrates strong 
growth in both coal and nuclear power, new entries 
into the Egyptian power generation fleet. However, 
the REmap Options largely replace these two power 
sources, adding a further 5 GW of natural gas-fired 
generation to help facilitate flexible generation 
in a power system with a high share of variable 
renewable power (Figure 27).
This significant growth in solar PV, CSP and wind 
is largely the result of rapidly improving market 
conditions for these power technologies (the costs 
for which are summarised in the cost and benefits 
section of this chapter) and the ability for new 
plants to be built quickly to meet the country’s 
rapidly growing electricity demand.

The use of biomass for power generation is currently 
very limited in Egypt. The main exception is the use 
of bagasse in sugarcane mills to produce electricity 
in co generation systems. But given the availability 
of agricultural residues that are currently burnt 
in the field or unutilised, significant potential for 
growth exists. In particular, the use of rice residues 
(husks and straw) and an improvement in the 
energy efficiency of sugar mills could be interesting 
opportunities. Because of this, the REmap Options 
assume some small growth in co generation based 
bioenergy power; however, the contribution remains 
modest in the overall power system.
As an example of low-hanging fruit in Egypt’s 
biomass-based industries, the sugarcane industry 
has the potential to maximise the generation of 
surplus electricity through the efficient use of 
biomass residues, which should be promoted. Older 
installations in existing plants often operate at lower 
pressures, with low thermal efficiency. Given the 
development of technology, and provided the right 
incentives are in place, retrofitting old plants and 
promoting the installation of the latest technology 
in new plants is a pathway that could be pursued. 
For instance, investing in high-pressure boilers 
in steam co generation systems in the sugarcane 
industry could generate a potential 30 kWh per 
tonne of sugarcane in very low-efficiency systems, 
to 140 kWh per tonne of sugarcane in the most 
advanced (Mitr Phol, 2014). Promoting the use of 
modern installations that convert biomass to power 
at the highest efficiencies is a must and depends 
on appropriate incentive mechanisms being put in 
place.
The expansion of biomass-based IPPs is also an 
option. Abdelhady et al. (2014) investigated the 
potential of rice straw for energy production in 
Egypt and estimated that about 3 Mt of rice straw 
are disposed of by open burning in the field every 
year, causing environmental problems. In their 
study, they assessed the performance of a power 
plant fuelled by rice straw and found that it has 
significant potential to be used as fuel for power 
generation in the country. And the use of biogas 
produced from the anaerobic digestion of animal 
manure and wastewater treatment sludge could 
further boost the potential, as pointed out by
Said et al. (2013).

Power capacity (GW)If all the REmap Options were deployed, the share of 
variable renewable energy (VRE) (solar PV, wind and 
CSP without storage) in Egypt’s power system would 
stand at 40% of annual generation in 2030. REmap does 
not analyse what types of flexibility measures might 
be needed in order to accommodate this amount of 
variable production capacity. IRENA has projects and 
analysis on the topic from other countries, regions and 
for general power system contexts. However, further 
study and analysis needs to take place for the Egypt 
results in order to provide a better understanding of 
how electricity end users, local grid and transmission 
operators, and government regulators can start to 
plan for a power system with increasing shares of VRE 
power technologies.
Renewable energy resources such as solar and wind 
are often operated differently from conventional 
power generation plants due to their variability. 
Depending on the share of VRE and the particular 
features of the power system, to guarantee an efficient 
and reliable supply of electricity these differences may 
prompt changes in the way the systems are planned 
and operated. The variability of VRE and limitations 
in forecasting its production with high accuracy can 
pose new challenges for the planning and operation 
of the power system. If high shares of VRE are to 
be integrated, the system must be able to deal with 
additional uncertainty and variability in its operation.
A recently published IRENA report, “Planning for the 
renewable future: Long-term modelling and tools 
to expand variable renewable power in emerging 
economies”, part of AVRIL (Addressing Variable 
Renewable Energy in Long-term Energy Planning), 
explains the best practices in long-term planning 
and modelling to accommodate high shares of VRE 
(IRENA, 2017d). Requirements for VRE generators 
to support the stable operation of the system must 
be identified and established. One way is through 
updates to the existing grid codes. An IRENA report, 
“Scaling Up Variable Renewable Power: The Role of 
Grid Codes” (IRENA, 2016d), explains various aspects 
of grid connection code development, with country 
illustrations that might serve as a reference for Egypt’s 
future grid code development as the VRE share 
increases.
Additional efforts include strengthening and 
called “smart grids”. A study on the topic (IRENA, 
2013), details how effective deployment of smart grids 
can play a crucial role in smoothing the integration of 
higher shares of renewable power. Smart grids also 
support the decentralised production of power and 
enable the creation of new business models through 
enhanced information flow. Additionally, flexibility 
on the demand side is provided by consumer 
engagement and improved system control. A further 
IRENA report, “Smart Grids and Renewables: A CostBenefit Analysis Guide for Developing Countries” 
(IRENA, 2015), provides insights on cost-benefit 
analysis of smart grid systems in developing countries, 
which could be potentially applicable to Egypt.
In recent years and as early as summer of 2017, the 
MOERE agreed new contracts for the provision of 
smart meters. The aim is to help utilities improve the 
management and operation of the country’s energy 
networks. The deal is part of an effort by the ministry 
to install up to 20 million smart meters in the next few 
years.
IRENA’s publication on adapting market design 
to high shares of VRE (IRENA, 2017d) highlights 
that distribution companies will play a key role 
in the deployment and operation of grid-related 
infrastructure, such as EV charging stations in public 
areas or distributed storage. Egypt does not have 
explicit plans to see large-scale deployment of 
millions of EVs; however, REmap identifies significant 
potential, with almost 700 000 on the road by 2030. 
If Egypt were to develop a vehicle-to-grid scheme 
allowing EVs to participate in grid ancillary services 
such as frequency regulation, load shifting, demand 
response or energy management support in the 
home, those services could help enable increasing 
shares of VRE.
Planning for a future with higher shares of VRE needs 
to start today. To understand how this can be done, 
resources such as those listed in this section are a 
starting point for policy makers to better understand 
the broad scope of technology solutions, regulations 
and market approaches that address the issue. 
However, further study and analysis need to take place 
for Egypt so as to provide a better understanding of 
how electricity end users, local grid and transmission 
operators, and government regulators can start to emphasising analysis of remote, rural or mini-grids, 
cities and regions, and demand response, smart 
metering or electric charging.
Buildings sector
• The buildings sector sees energy demand 
growth of 135% over the period 2014-2030 in the
Reference Case. Most of this increase occurs due
to growth in electricity consumption, but also
some increase occurs in natural gas and oil 
use. Traditional uses of bioenergy make a small 
contribution and remain unchanged in the 
Reference Case, meeting under 3% of sector 
energy needs. The renewable share does increase 
in the Reference Case, largely the result of increases 
in renewable electricity, but some addition of solar 
thermal and modern bioenergy is also seen.
• The REmap Options focus on three key end-use 
technologies: solar thermal, modern bioenergy 
and electric cooking. Modern bioenergy use, 
including biogas, and electricity for cooking are 
key residential applications, along with increased 
use of solar thermal for water heating. The share 
of renewables in energy demand for heating and 
other direct uses increases from 1.5% to 9% by 
2030, while the overall renewable share in the 
sector when including electricity reaches 35% 
in 2030.
The buildings sector’s energy demand in Egypt 
comprises a mix of electricity for appliances and 
cooling, some limited thermal needs for water heating, 
and the use of fuels for cooking. The sector sees 
strong growth in energy demand of 135% between 
2014 and 2030 in the Reference Case. The majority 
of this growth comes in the form of electricity, used 
in appliances or for cooling, and natural gas and 
oil products (mostly LPG) used for cooking. The 
Reference Case sees little change in bioenergy use, 
with small amounts of bioenergy still being used 
in the form of traditional uses for cooking, and a 
small amount of solar thermal hot water. The result 
of these developments is little change in the share 
of renewables providing fuel for heating or cooking; 
however, when renewable electricity is considered the 
share does increase to 15%.
The REmap Options focus on three key end-use 
technologies: solar thermal, modern bioenergy and 
electric cooking. The main drivers are the use of 
modern bioenergy, including biogas, and electricity 
for cooking, and increased use of solar thermal mostly 
for water heating. In REmap, the share of renewables 
providing energy for heating and other direct uses 
increases from 1.5% to 9%, while the overall renewable 
share in the sector when including electricity reaches 
35% (Figure 28).

thermal
Modern
bioenergySolar thermal has been used for water heating 
in Egypt for decades, but has significant 
additional potential. REmap sees the addition of 
around 5.2 gigawatts thermal (GWth), or around 
125000 medium-sized systems. These are installed 
in buildings that have larger heating demand, such 
as hotels, commercial buildings and apartment 
complexes. Solar thermal systems in REmap can 
meet around 3% the buildings sector’s energy 
demand.
The use of bioenergy in the residential sector is 
usually a matter of debate because statistics tend to 
be unreliable and difficult to obtain. A fair assessment 
of bioenergy use in this sector is essential, based on 
household surveys, in order to orient policy making. 
In general terms, however, traditional uses of solid 
biomass residues from farming and livestock are 
usually significant in regions with little access to 
affordable alternative cooking fuels such as LPG, 
biogas and electricity.
In such situations, the use of modern, clean cook stoves 
with improved solid biomass fuels (e.g. in the form of 
briquettes or pellets) can significantly improve the 
practice of solid biomass use for heating and cooking 
and, most importantly, reduce indoor air pollution, 
with strong improvements in health conditions. These 
modern cook stoves are up to four times more efficient 
compared with traditional cooking methods, reducing 
cooking times and indoor air pollution.
Cook stoves based on ethanol gels have also gained 
attention in recent years, with promising results in 
various African and Asian countries. Biogas is another 
alternative that, when implemented with the right 
long-term support to ensure adequate maintenance 
of the biodigesters, yields positive results. In the 
Reference Case there remains a small amount of 
traditional use of bioenergy, largely in rural, upper Nile 
regions of Egypt. In REmap most of the remaining 
traditional bioenergy is assumed to be replaced with 
modern solid biomass cookstoves, as well as some 
biogas units.
Electric cooking is a further option. This is a clear trend 
in developed countries, but uptake varies widely. The 
challenge for widespread deployment in developing 
countries is the need for a grid connection. Older 
operation. New induction cooking technologies have 
dropped significantly in price in the last few years, and 
their efficiency is higher and electricity demand lower. 
Whereas electric coils need 2.0 kW to deliver 1.1 kW 
of heat (55% efficiency), natural gas has a similar 
efficiency of 50% and LPG has around 40% efficiency, 
induction efficiency is closer to 90%. Therefore, 
modern electric cooking technologies can be a means 
of reducing the use of LPG or other fuels and saving 
consumers money.
One of the largest sources of electricity demand 
in the buildings sector is for cooling. While almost 
the entirety of this increase in cooling demand will 
be met with traditional air conditioners, which are 
seeing increases in their efficiency, they still require 
significant amounts of electricity. Solutions do exist to 
meet cooling demand through novel technologies and 
approaches; for instance, district cooling is an option 
for new residential developments, large commercial 
users and hotels, where a centralised, high-efficiency 
cooling unit provides either chilled water or cooled 
air to numerous blocks or buildings. A recent IRENA 
study outlined in more detail the opportunity for this 
technology (IRENA, 2017d). Technologies such as 
cold storage can also be considered in certain cases. 
During the night or times when electricity is plentiful 
(from variable renewable power generation such as 
solar and wind), ice is produced, stored, and then 
used when cooling is needed and electricity is in short 
supply or costly.
Industrial sector
• The industrial sector’s energy demand is the 
largest of all end-use sectors in Egypt and sees 
the largest growth in energy demand, with an 
increase of around 150% occurring between 
2014 and 2030. In the Reference Case, 80% of 
this growth is met with fossil fuels, with most of 
the remainder being met by increased demand 
for electricity and slight growth in bioenergy. 
Overall the renewable share in the sector 
remains at historic levels of around 13% in the 
Reference Case.
• The main technology deployed in the REmap 
Case is solar thermal used for industrial process 
heating applications and pre-heating. The share Figure 29. Industrial sector renewable share and additions as TFEC, 2014, 2030
Note: The figure shows two renewable energy shares; the “renewable share of industrial sector energy” shows the share as a percentage 
of all energy consumed in the sectorincluding fuelsdirect uses and electricity; the share in parentheses shows the renewable share of 
The industrial sector sees the largest energy demand 
growth of any end-use sector, with an increase of 
almost 150% by 2030. Fossil fuels meet 80% this 
growth in the Reference Case, with the largest 
increases in oil products, followed by natural gas and 
coal. The remainder of the increase in energy demand 
is mostly met with electricity, followed by small 
amounts of bioenergy. Over the period the renewable 
share, if viewed in terms of fuels and direct uses of 
energy, stays more or less constant at around 10% in 
the Reference Case (see Figure 29).
Broadly defined, the industrial sector requires energy 
in the form of electricity and fuels to combust for 
process heat. For heat, bioenergy is typically a key 
renewable solution due to its ability to be combusted 
for higher-temperature process heat; however, 
bioenergy supply is limited in the industrial sector 
in Egypt and therefore additional potential is not 
assumed in the REmap Case. The main technology 
assumed for increasing renewable heat in the REmap 
Options in industry is solar thermal, specifically, 
low-temperature technologies used mainly in food 
processing for pre-heating and drying, or other 
low- to medium-temperature uses in the textile and 
chemicals subsectors. However, these additions are 
limited to around 3 GWth of solar thermal systems, 
which could provide around 1.5% of sector energy.
However, there is a very active bioenergy market 
for industrial uses. The use of bagasse in co 
generation systems in the sugarcane industry is a 
good example, but the cement sector also currently 
plays a prominent role in the use of biomass as 
a substitute for fossil fuels in Egypt. Agricultural 
residues, RDF produced from municipal solid 
waste and sewage sludge from wastewater have 
been used successfully in some cement plants and 
there is potential to expand. Currently the cement 
sector satisfies a little over 6% of its thermal energy 
needs using alternative fuels such as agricultural 
residues, RDF and dried sewage sludge (IFC, 
2016). However, the potential for growth exists as 
biomass resources are available and the rate of 
substitution could technically increase to higher 
levels (international experience shows rates of 
substitution as high as 40%). The International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) recently conducted an 
analysis of the sector in Egypt and assessed that 
in the worst-case scenario the share of alternative 
fuels could almost double, increasing to 13%, with 
potential to reach 30%. This would also benefit 
the development of more sustainable waste 
management solutions by incorporating added 
value to the collection and adequate processing of 
solid waste, agricultural residues and wastewater 
treatment sludge.

Note: The use of electricity in transport technologies, such as EVs, is significantly more efficient than liquid fuels when viewed in final 
energy terms (right figure). If viewed in terms of activity, such as passenger kilometres, one unit of electricity can provide between two 
and four times the service compared to an electric fuel. The figure, therefore, vastly understates the impact of electricity in transport 
modes such as passenger road services, in which the REmap Options result in 25% of the vehicle stock being electric and providing 
around 40% of passenger service. The figure also shows two renewable energy shares; the “renewable share of transport sector energy”

Biofuels
Transport sector
• The transport sector sees energy demand 
increase by 93% between 2014 and 2030. Oil 
products meet 95% of this increase in demand, 
with only small additions from liquid biofuels 
and electricity. The renewable energy share in 
the sector is just 2% in the Reference Case.
• REmap focuses on identifying the potential 
of EVs in various modes, and as a result the 
demand for electricity in the sector almost 
triples. The number of passenger EVs on the 
road by 2030 would total 700 000 and the 
renewable energy share in the sector would 
increase to 11%. REmap also assumes some 
additional liquid biofuels, namely biodiesel.
In Egypt, the transport sector sees strong energy 
demand growth, increasing by 93% with almost all 
of this increase met with oil products. The transport 
sector is traditionally the most challenging sector 
in which to increase renewable energy. In the 
Reference Case the fuel mix changes little. There is 
slight growth in liquid biofuels, providing around 2% 
of sector energy, and the use of electricity increases 
marginally.
Given the severe constraints on the availability 
of agricultural land and water resources, the 
development of bioenergy crops for liquid biofuel 
production faces significant challenges in the country 
and the use of biofuels in transport is not significant 
in Egypt. But alternative solutions could be pursued 
in an effort to reduce dependency on fossil fuels in 
gasoline and diesel vehicle fleets.
Given the vast amounts of desert land, the cultivation 
of energy crops on such terrain using reclaimed 
wastewater is an alternative option. In fact, positive 
experiences have been recorded in the use of treated 
wastewater that does not reach the required quality 
standards for other uses, for irrigation of non-edible 
crops in desert land (Wahaab, 2013). These include 
energy crops such as jatropha, which can be used for biodiesel production. Fawzy and Romagnoli 
(2016) and El Diwany et al. (2008) conclude that 
the production of biodiesel from jatropha in Egypt 
would have many environmental benefits, such 
as combating desertification, and fewer impacts 
compared to fossil fuel diesel. In view of the 
experimental results and economic assumptions, the 
prospects might be positive.
Another alternative would be the production of 
cellulosic ethanol. Cellulosic biomass residues 
from crop production, such as rice straw, maize 
residues and sugar cane residues, represent suitable 
candidates for ethanol production, according to Said 
et al. (2013) and Tewfik et al. (2013). Both studies 
conclude that crop residues, especially rice straw, 
would represent a good candidate as a renewable 
energy source in Egypt that could be used to produce 
ethanol and decrease the dependence on fossil fuels.
Biofuels are currently being researched as a way to 
resolve a municipal and agricultural waste issue rather 
than as an energy opportunity, such that energy is 
simply a by-product. In this regard, considerable 
potential is available for biofuels to be taken forward, 
as transport sector decarbonisation cannot solely rely 
on electricity. Embarking on liquid biofuels to power 
the aviation and heavy-freight sector could promote 
local industry, while also contributing to any energy 
security target. For these reasons REmap assumes 
that some liquid biofuel additions could take place. 
Around 90% of the liquid biofuel supply would be 
biodiesel, largely from jatropha, with the remainder 
from a combination of sugarcane residues. In total, 
around 10% of sector energy could be met with liquid 
biofuels.
REmap also emphasises electric mobility in transport. 
EVs are an emerging technology that could provide 
an important link with the power system when 
coupled with VRE such as solar PV or wind, from 
which Egypt will generate significant power. EVs are 
also a means to drive down levels of air pollution in 
urban areas. The Reference Case sees no meaningful 
increase in the number of EVs on Egypt’s roads. 
However, REmap results in over 700 000 on the 
roads by 2030, representing 25% of the car stock 
and around 40% of passenger road activity, and 
providing 8 GWh of potential storage capacity.
EVs come in other forms besides cars; electric twoand three-wheelers are also deployed, particularity 
in urban areas, with REmap seeing over 1.5 million 
on the road. Additionally, larger EVs will also see 
adoption. Electric buses are emerging as a key 
public transport solution that has uses along certain 
transport lines within certain ranges, or where 
overhead charging, intermittent charging or endpoint charging is possible. And light-freight vehicles 
for services such as package delivery or fleet uses 
also sees the adoption of forms of electric mobility.
4.3 Costs and benefits of 
 renewable energy
The previous sections provided an overview of the 
potential for accelerated renewable energy uptake 
and discussed the technologies across all energy 
sectors. This section outlines the associated costs 
and benefits of higher renewables deployment and 
discusses the level of investment that would be 
required.
REmap assesses costs and benefits using a variety of 
indicators; these include:
• A substitution approach, detailing if there is an 
incremental cost or saving from a renewable 
energy technology compared to a substituted 
conventional technology. This view looks only 
at the associated cost of energy service, i.e. the 
relative cost of providing the same amount of 
energy from a renewable technology versus a 
conventional one. The sum of these costs shows 
whether there is an incremental energy system 
cost or saving.
• An externality assessment, which quantifies 
reductions in external costs due to lower levels 
of air pollution and CO2 emissions.
• An assessment of the level of investment needed 
to deploy all the renewable energy capacity 
outlined in the Reference Case and the REmap 
Case; complementary infrastructure is not part 
of the assessment.
For more information about the approach and 
methodology, please see Annex I.Costs and savings
• The REmap Options would reduce energy 
system costs by some USD 0.9 billion annually 
in 2030, equivalent to USD -7.0 per MWh. They 
also result in reductions in external costs of
USD 8.1 billion annually on average in 
2030. Therefore, the package of renewable 
technologies is both cheaper than the fossil 
alternatives and also results in significant 
reductions in external costs.
Substitution cost is a metric that compares the 
relative attractiveness of renewable energy 
technologies against conventional ones. These 
conventional variants are technologies that 
exist in the Reference Case and are replaced by 
renewable technologies in the REmap Options.
Substitution cost therefore measures the relative 
cost or saving from this substitution, i.e. how energy 
service cost would change if a renewable technology 
were deployed instead of a conventional one. It can 
be shown at the individual technology level using 
technology cost-supply curves as seen in Figure 31, 
or through other metrics such as marginal cost of 
CO2
 mitigation.
A variety of factors can affect the substitution 
cost, including the capital cost of technologies, 
their performance characteristics, the assumed 
discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) 
and fuel costs. The cost is also driven by the type 
of conventional technology substituted, i.e. if 
coal is substituted, which has low fuel costs, the 
substitution cost will likely be higher than if oil, with 
high fuel costs, is substituted.
The type of conventional technology substituted 
depends on factors that include the sector in 
question, the age of capital stock in operation, and 
planned new additions. Because of rapid energy 
demand growth in Egypt, this assessment only 
considers substitution of either a) capital stock 
reaching the end of its operational lifetime and in 
need of replacement, or b) new capital stock required 
over the analysis period. Therefore, no additional 
costs are assumed to account for early retirement.

11% 13% 15% 17% 19% 21% --> 22%The result of this substitution approach is shown in 
Figure 31. The figure is a cost-supply curve showing 
on the y-axis the substitution cost of the technology 
(average for a given renewable technology) (the 
REmap Option) compared to a conventional variant. 
The cost is shown in USD per GJ of final energy 
(3.6GJ is equal to 1 MWh). On the x-axis is the share of 
renewable energy in TFEC. Therefore, the width of the 
bar directly corresponds to how much energy from 
that source is consumed as final energy. The larger 
the bar, the more energy consumed, and therefore the 
higher amount of capacity that is required.
The curve shows that Egypt increases the share of 
renewable energy in TFEC from 5% in 2014 to 11% 
in the Reference Case by 2030. The REmap Options 
double this share so that renewables reach 22% of 
TFEC by 2030. For the purpose of presentation, the 
Reference Case growth has been scaled to better 
show the REmap Option bars in the figure.
The average substitution cost of the grouping of 
renewable technologies, i.e. the REmap Options, is 
USD -7.0 per MWh (USD -1.9 per GJ in the figure), 
equivalent to a saving of USD 0.7 cents per kWh. This 
means that if the package of renewable technologies 
identified in REmap were deployed, the cost per 
MWh of final energy across Egypt’s energy system 
would be USD 7.0 per MWh lower. However, this 
effect is across the entirety of Egypt’s energy market 
and does not include either reduced externalities, 
which if internalised into energy prices would 
result in further savings, or in the possible need for 
increased investments in infrastructure. If only the 
power technology options are considered, they have 
an average substitution cost of USD -14.0 per MWh.
If specific technologies are examined, one sees how 
the cost-competitiveness of the REmap Options 
differ. The most affordable technologies include 
solar PV in the power sector and solar thermal hot 
water systems in buildings. The other source of costeffective renewable potential is wind power; however, 
its potential is limited due to the significant growth 
already occurring in the Reference Case. In industry 
the potential of solar thermal heat for low-temperature 
applications (< 150°C) is competitive on cost; however, 
its potential is limited. CSP is an important technology 
for providing power that can be coupled with storage, 
The transport sector technologies show a mixed 
picture. Liquid biofuels have positive substitution 
costs, as do EVs. EVs do not show significant 
potential in the curve; however, this is not because 
their deployment is limited, but rather the result 
of what is displayed in the curve. For one, EVs are 
highly efficient and are on average three to four 
times more efficient than internal combustion 
engines, meaning it takes one-quarter the amount 
of energy to deliver the same amount of passenger 
or freight service. Additionally, the curve only shows 
the share of renewable electricity consumed by those 
vehicles, i.e. around one-quarter of their electricity 
demand. Therefore, if all electricity consumed by 
EVs were shown, then the contribution would be 
four times larger. For these reasons this figure is not 
the best way of displaying the relative importance 
of EVs, or electric technologies in general. Also, as 
demand technologies they do not produce energy, 
but because of their importance in increasing the 
renewable share of energy in transport (by shifting 
energy consumption to the power sector where 
ample renewable technology options are available) 
and their beneficial effect on air pollution, they are 
shown in the curve.
Figure 32 shows how energy system costs and 
external costs are affected by the REmap Options 
at a sector level. When the substitution costs for the 
group of REmap Options are summed, they result in 
a perspective on how those renewable technologies 
affect energy system costs. The REmap Options in 
Egypt result in a reduction of energy system costs of 
USD 0.9 billion annually by 2030.
Energy system costs do not consider reduced 
externalities, which result from lower levels of air 
pollution and reduced CO2
 emissions. Lower levels 
of air pollution improve the conditions for human 
health and the local environment. Air pollution is a 
cause of ill health, particularly in cities, and results in 
early morbidity and mortality. CO2 is a greenhouse 
gas, which is the main contributor to global 
warming, and numerous studies have examined 
its effect and determined a range for the social 
cost of carbon. REmap assesses both outdoor and 
indoor air pollution using a methodology developed 
specifically for the purpose (IRENA, 2016c), while 
CO2 is assessed using a social cost of carbon ranging Two sectors, transport and buildings, have 
incremental energy system costs resulting from 
deployment of the REmap Options. This means the 
groups of technologies identified in REmap for those 
sectors are more expensive on an energy service 
basis than the conventional alternatives. However, 
both the transport and buildings sectors see savings 
related to lower levels of air pollution, which in both 
cases are larger than the incremental energy system 
costs. The power sector sees significant savings both 
in terms of lower energy system costs and reduced 
externalities.
What is not quantified in this are the costs and benefits 
of reducing imports of oil and its products, such as 
diesel and petrol, and the larger macroeconomic 
benefits to jobs and GDP that would result from 
producing more of Egypt’s energy needs locally.
In total, the REmap Options result in a reduction 
in energy system costs of around USD 0.9 billion 
annually in 2030, equivalent to a reduction of 
USD 7.0 per MWh. Reductions in external costs 
due to reduced adverse effects of air pollution 
on human health and reduced environmental 
They would amount to at least USD 2.9 billion in 
reduced externalities in 2030 based on the low 
estimate, or USD 8.1 billion based on the average 
estimate. Therefore, when including both reduced 
energy system costs and reduced external costs, 
total savings to the Egyptian economy from the 
renewable technologies identified in the REmap 
Options are on average USD 9.0 billion annually in 
2030 compared to the Reference Case.
Air pollution and CO2 impacts
• External costs related to air pollution and CO2
are important factors when considering the 
cost and benefit proposition of renewable 
energy. For instance, the REmap Options 
reduce external costs related to air pollution 
alone by between USD 1.1 billion and
USD 4.7 billion annually by 2030.
• Energy-related CO2 emissions increase by 
130% in the Reference Case to 350 Mt by 2030, 
with the REmap Options slowing that increase 
to 60%, with just 250 Mt of energy-related 
CO2
 emissions in 2030 – a reduction over the

Energy-related CO2 emissions (Mt/yr)
• Egypt will see a significant increase in energy 
demand of almost 120% by 2030. Therefore, 
similar increases in energy-related CO2 are also 
seen, with an expected 126% increase in the 
Reference Case to 350 Mt annually by 2030 
(see Figure 33). The REmap Case results in a 
decrease in energy-related CO2 emissions of 
30% compared to the Reference Case level. 
The REmap Options reduce the increase in CO2
emissions from 130% to 60% over the period to 
2030 (resulting in a 30% reduction in emissions 
in the REmap Case compared to the Reference 
Case).
When assessing external costs, the more directly 
measurable effect of fossil fuels is on local air 
pollution. External costs related to air pollution 
from fossil fuels, largely resulting from adverse 
effects on human health, increase from a range of 
USD 7-30 billion in 2014, to USD 12 48 billion by 
2030 in the Reference Case.
Air pollution costs associated with oil use 
are highest, due largely to the effect its use in 
transport has in urban environments. The REmap 
Options provide significant benefits if renewable 
energy is deployed in transport, particularly by 
EVs in cities.
The second-largest source of external costs from 
air pollution is coal, largely in industry but also 
in the power sector. In total across all sectors 
the REmap Options reduce external costs related 
to air pollution by between USD 1.1 billion and 
USD 4.7 billion annually by 2030.
When considering reductions in external costs 
from reduced adverse effects of air pollution on 
human health and the environment and social 
damage from CO2
 (using the average estimate), 
total savings would be at least USD 3.8 billion 
(based on the low estimate), or USD 8.1 billion 
annually by 2030 (based on an average estimate).Investment needs
• Egypt will need significant investment in 
energy capacity by 2030 in order to meet 
the rising energy needs of the country, with 
demand expected to increase by almost 120% 
over the period. The Reference Case sees 
investment in renewable energy capacity 
averaging USD 2.5 billion per year to 2030. 
The REmap Options increase that average 
yearly investment by USD 4.0 billion, resulting 
in a total average investment need of USD 6.5 
billion per year to 2030 in renewable capacity 
for power and thermal uses.
• Of the USD 4.0 billion per year incremental 
investment in renewable energy capacity 
resulting from the REmap Options,
USD 0.9 billion per year would be investment 
redirected from fossil fuels to renewables.
Significant investment is required across Egypt’s 
entire energy system due to the increase in demand 
for energy of almost 120% by 2030, encompassing 
electricity generation and transmission, capacity 
for thermal uses, cooling and cooking, and the 
transport sector.
During the period 2014-30, investment in renewable 
energy capacity in both power and thermal 
technologies would need to average USD 6.5 billion 
per year (see Figure 34) in order to reach the 
level of renewables identified in REmap. Of this 
total, USD 2.5 billion per year is expected to take 
place in the Reference Case. The REmap Options 
necessitate the mobilisation of an additional
USD 4.0 billion per year in renewable energy 
investment, of which USD 3.1 billion would be new 
investment and USD 0.9 billion redirected from 
fossil fuel investment towards renewables.

RECOMMENDATIONSEgypt has already achieved remarkable progress in developing an enabling policy, 
regulatory and institutional framework for the deployment of renewable energy, as 
well as gaining experience in implementation of a wide range of renewable projects, 
particularly for solar and wind electricity generation.
This chapter highlights the key barriers identified throughout the RRA/REmap 
process and the corresponding actions to overcome them, based on the following 
four pillars: institutional, legal and regulatory framework challenges; improving the 
market structure for renewables; mapping renewable energy resources and grid 
integration; and maximising the benefits of renewable energy deployment.
The adoption of these recommended actions would contribute to the widespread 
use of renewable energy through the implementation of government programmes 
that would ensure the realisation of the targets identified by the ISES to 2035.

 policy, regulatory and 
 institutional framework
Challenges
The ISES to 2035 aims to ensure the technical and 
financial sustainability of the energy sector, while 
targeting energy diversification through renewable 
energy penetration as well as setting a plan for the 
gradual phase-out of energy sector subsidies by 
2022. The selected scenario approved by the SEC in 
October 2016 envisages a 42% share of renewables in 
the electricity generation mix by 2035. The adopted 
strategic targets for renewables deployment are over 
15 GW by 2022, 42 GW by 2030 and about 52 GW by 
2035 according to Scenario 4b.
The successful realisation of such planned capacities 
would require concrete action by the government 
to address challenges that hinder accelerated 
deployment of renewable energy driven by the 
ambitious targets set in the strategy.
The ISES needs to reflect the response of the energy 
sector to economic developments at the national and 
regional level, particularly technological advances 
and innovation, as well as resource price levels. The 
best available data must be used, particularly to keep 
abreast of future cost learning curves for renewables 
and the rapid transformation being witnessed in 
power systems globally.
The ISES to 2035 has been developed based on 
a least-cost scenario, where renewable energy is 
envisaged to have a share of 42% of the installed 
capacity mix, with coal at 16%. However, since the 
strategy was developed in 2014, the electricity context 
has drastically changed, particularly with the rapid 
decline in the cost of renewable energy technologies.
The introduction of coal and nuclear, as envisaged in 
the strategy, would support the diversification of the 
existing energy mix and decrease the dependence on 
gas. Yet it would contribute less to the achievement 
of energy security, since the country would still rely 
on imports from international markets. With specific 
regard to the introduction of coal, this would hinder 
the country’s efforts to achieve its climate ambitions 
and corresponding NDC, knowing that Egypt is highly 
vulnerable to climate change.14
With regard to nuclear energy, nuclear fuel production 
processes will require long-term planning and 
heavy financial investment. Given the declining 
cost of renewable energy technologies, the costcompetitiveness of nuclear technology in the Egyptian 
context may need to be re-analysed.
The main driver for the introduction of coal in Egypt’s 
energy mix is a result of the 2014 electricity shortages, 
where energy policy makers were looking for a rapid 
solution to reduce Egypt’s dependency on imported 
gas. Today, the scenario is subject to drastic change 
following the recent gas discoveries, coupled with the 
significant decline in the cost of renewables and rising 
environmental concerns over coal-fired generation.
Infrastructure limitations hinder the expansion of 
rooftop PV installations. Similarly, the inadequate 
space on building rooftops for SWH installation limits 
opportunities for market growth in Egypt, as most of 
the space available is utilised for water storage tanks 
and satellite dishes.
While the regulatory framework addresses electricity 
production systems using wind and solar, the strategy 
has not given sufficient focus to the exploitation 
of biomass potential. This is evident in the limited 
progress achieved on biomass mainly due to the 
limited availability of local capacity, along with the 
considerable cost associated with biomass-based 
electricity.
When considering energy-from-waste applications, 
the current framework consists of a recommendation 
from the relevant cabinet minister in the form of an 
indicative guiding electricity tariff for biogas/biofuel, 
which is expected to be issued soon.
A set of laws, regulations and implementation 
schemes has been adopted to create an effective 
enabling environment to promote the accelerated 
deployment of renewable electricity and encourage 
the participation of private investors. However, some 
difficulties have been experienced by developers and 
investors of renewable energy sources for electricity 
in the course of project implementation. This includes unavailability of contractual documents for projects at 
the time the FITs were announced.
Existing fuel subsidies for conventional energy 
sources create market distortions and do not allow 
renewable energy to compete on an equal level, 
thus hindering the smooth deployment of renewable 
energy technologies.
The initial FIT scheme for on-grid distributed PV 
systems was not found to be sufficiently financially 
attractive due to the prevailing currency exchange rate. 
As a result, many consumers preferred to use the net 
metering scheme. In the second-phase FIT scheme, 
started in October 2016, the tariff was increased to 
improve the financial feasibility of these systems.
The sector has a cadre of qualified, trained and 
experienced personnel. However, the capacity of 
the agencies in charge of power system planning is 
rather limited, particularly with respect to forecasting 
renewable energy sources for electricity generation 
and load for renewable energy sources, the calculation 
of capacity credit of renewable energy systems for 
electricity plants, and the integration of large-scale 
renewable energy systems into electricity systems.
The prevailing legislation has been able to stimulate 
the renewable energy market through a variety of 
support schemes (i.e. EPC, BOO, FIT, IPP and net 
metering), without any specific mechanism targeting 
on-grid or off-grid applications. Despite the strong 
and diversified institutional capacity of the sector, 
recent experiences have underscored the need to 
clarify specific roles of the concerned institutions 
and enhance their effectiveness in carrying out their 
respective roles, which would provide positive signals 
and confidence to the market and investors.
While the NREA has a clear leading role under the 
EPC scheme, its overall institutional responsibilities, 
including its role in land acquisition for renewable 
energy implementation, could be further clarified and 
simplified for all renewable procurement schemes 
(BOO, IPP, FIT and net metering). The administrative 
procedures regarding land registration for renewable 
energy developers are rather complex.
The ISES to 2035 has set a goal to achieve a liberalised 
of renewables-based projects while gradually phasing 
out its present role as a renewable energy project 
developer. The NREA’s role as a developer has so 
far been given precedence, based on its current 
entitlement to land ownership for renewable energy 
projects, while also being the recipient of most of the 
soft loans attributed to these projects.
Recommended actions:
• Update the ISES to 2035, along with the associated 
policies, on a regular basis to incorporate 
developments in: technological advancements, 
particularly in renewable energy; availability and 
cost of imported and indigenous energy resources 
in the country; energy sector developments at the 
national, regional and international level affecting 
various economic sectors; and the geopolitical 
events in the region. Based on best practices 
and taking into account the rapid cost decline 
in renewable energy technologies, updating the 
strategy every two years is advisable (IRENA, 
2016c).
• Within the process of the strategy review, consider 
the REmap scenario which suggests that 53% of 
power generation from renewable sources by 
2030 is technically and economically feasible. This 
represents a doubling of the renewable energy 
share in the Reference Case and a rise from 9% in 
2014, in line with Scenario 3 of the ISES to 2035. 
This is also recommended to provide a reference 
point for elaborating quantifiable and realistic 
targets for the upcoming NDC review process.
• Give specific emphasis in the next update of the 
strategy to accelerated deployment of biomass 
energy. In preparation for this, conduct a study to 
evaluate its potential. Develop a strong regulatory 
framework and associated support schemes to 
promote biomass investments.
• Reassess the feasibility of introducing coal and 
nuclear in the electricity supply mix in light of the 
concerns over energy security, the environment 
and climate raised by coal and nuclear, in 
addition to their cost-competitiveness vis-à-vis 
renewables.relevant institutions, to develop and manage 
a centralised database for Egypt’s renewable 
energy sector, including resource assessments, 
renewable energy targets, strategies, policies and 
regulation.
• Reposition and empower the NREA as a 
“one-stop shop” providing all permits and 
authorisations required from relevant institutions 
and administrations relevant to renewables 
investments, to ease renewable energy project 
development and the implementation process. 
This may include expediting the selection process 
of the developers under any of the renewable 
energy development schemes (EPC, BOO and 
FIT), issuing renewable energy generation licences, 
allocating the land for planned renewable energy 
projects, and handling the contractual process 
(connection agreements and PPAs) between the 
developers and EETC.
• Ensure that the process for phasing out fossil fuel 
subsidies is observed by relevant authorities in 
the government, as per the established timeline, 
to provide positive signals to renewable energy 
investors and avoid market uncertainty.
• Assess the feasibility of developing specific 
mechanisms to incentivise deployment of 
distributed renewables applications in public 
buildings.
• Establish a legal framework for solid waste 
management that focuses on the institutional 
responsibilities for collection and choice of sites 
for recycling and treatment of wastes; develop 
a mechanism with the MOERE to require local 
authorities to recycle organic waste.
• Develop specific capacity targets for the 
deployment of solar thermal systems. Explore 
different options for supporting accelerated 
penetration of solar thermal systems in the 
residential and industrial sectors. This may 
include: mandating real-estate project developers 
to deploy active and passive solar thermal 
systems in the design of new buildings and 
cities; integrating solar systems in the design of 
new industrial facilities through the identification 
the use of solar thermal systems; and replacing 
electric/gas water heaters with SWHs.
• Facilitate the transition towards the net metering 
scheme for distributed solar PV systems by lifting 
the existing ceiling for installed capacity which 
is, at present, required not to exceed the power 
contracted with distribution companies.
• Facilitate access to data and information for 
project developers with respect to: on-site solar 
and wind resource assessments; land allocation 
procedures; and the performance of existing 
renewable energy power plants under the harsh 
environmental conditions.
5.2 Improving the market structure 
 for higher renewables uptake
Challenges
The current electricity market is the single buyer 
model. Given that most of the current renewable 
energy schemes depend on the state-owned off-taker 
(EETC), a transition process is currently under way to 
adopt new market rules as per the Electricity Law No. 
87 2015, where direct contractual relations between 
suppliers and end users can exist. Allowing the 
transmission operator to conduct trading operations 
in addition to system operation and dispatching 
hinders this transition process.
With respect to the implementation of PPAs, EETC, as 
the off-taker of the power produced, has sometimes 
had difficulty in meeting its financial obligations 
for the power received, causing financial strain on 
electricity generation companies.
Commercial interest rates extended to SMEs are 
at rather high levels, currently at 18%, thereby 
discouraging SMEs from successful participation 
in the renewable energy market. Most existing 
financing schemes provided by multilateral or bilateral 
development institutions are not leveraged on by 
commercial banks. They have relatively low interest 
rates; however, they target large-scale renewable 
energy projects and are subject to international exchange rates hinder larger funding opportunities 
from international financing institutions due to the 
limited ability of the Central Bank of Egypt to meet 
hard-currency reserve requirements.
Different biomass technologies have been 
demonstrated in Egypt, particularly in the production 
of biogas from animal waste for thermal uses in rural 
areas and the treatment of municipal solid waste in 
big cities. Remarkable progress has been achieved 
in developing and disseminating biogas digesters, 
establishing bioenergy service provider companies. 
Limited financial support schemes are available for 
off-grid solar and biomass electricity generation, as 
well as solar and biomass thermal systems (except for 
the Egysol).
Small-scale renewables projects receive limited 
interest from investors due to their rather small 
capacity and location in diverse regions across the 
country.
Recommended actions:
• Review the current terms and conditions of 
renewable energy PPAs to address concerns 
raised by investors, including putting in place 
standardised project document templates for 
renewable energy projects, which are being 
developed by IRENA and the Terrawatt Initiative 
and can provide solid guidance in standardising 
contractual procedures and documents as per 
international best practice (IRENA, 2016f).
• Encourage the bundling of several smaller-sized 
renewable energy projects through standardised 
project design to help achieve the required 
scale. In addition, this will help reduce project 
preparation and appraisal costs, and increase 
interest from the financial community, including 
private investors. Support from concessional 
lending schemes could possibly facilitate 
engagement of local financing partners, including 
domestic institutional investors.
• Explore the development of lending schemes 
specific to renewable energy projects that would 
enable the best use of limited concessional 
public resources (including those provided by 
5.3 Mapping renewable energy 
 resources and their integration 
 to the grid
Challenges
Several assessments of wind and solar resources have 
been conducted; yet they are not detailed enough 
to ensure the bankability of projects. Currently, 
the NREA is considering the possibility of making 
detailed resource measurements to further facilitate 
the implementation of renewable energy projects in 
a timely manner.
The installed capacity of the Egyptian power sector 
has been rapidly expanding during the last three 
years to overcome the shortage of electricity supply 
experienced in 2014. Total capacity is expected to 
reach 125 GW by 2030, including 42 GW of both largescale and distributed on-grid renewable energy, these 
numbers reaching 147 GW and 52 GW respectively 
by 2035. Considering the planned deployment of 
renewable energy to 2035, electricity grid expansion 
and operations need to be carefully planned, taking 
into account the effects of VRE on system stability 
and efficiency.
Recommended actions:
• Conduct zoning of cost-effective areas 
with high potential for renewable energy 
project development, to feed into the power 
sector planning process. This will enable the 
accommodation of larger shares of renewable 
power in the electricity generation mix while 
aligning transmission system extension, expansion 
and upgrades accordingly. Based on the zoning 
outcomes, specific sites should be identified 
using available methodologies and high-quality 
mesoscale solar and wind time series. This will 
shorten the overall lead time for large-scale ongrid solar and wind investments.
• Consider inclusion of measurement campaigns 
as part of the tendering process. While this may 
enable the NREA to claim its initial expenses 
in relation to resource assessment, where 
measurement activities are conducted by the 
developer the NREA will be relieved from this measurement, and the timely conduct of the 
process as well as the quality and transparency of 
data will need to be ensured.
• Undertake studies to identify viable options 
for improved power system flexibility to 
accommodate higher shares of VRE, including 
strengthening cross-border interconnections.
5.4 Understanding and maximising 
 the benefits of renewable 
 energy deployment
Challenges:
The ISES to 2035 does not address the potential for 
creating local jobs as a result of renewable energy 
deployment and lacks a national plan for that. In 
the current renewable energy context, the NREA 
is the main developer of renewable energy projects 
in Egypt, mainly supported through favourable 
financing instruments provided by development 
partners; however, for such renewable energy projects, 
imposing a requirement for a minimum level of local 
content hampers their bankability. Limited effort 
has been devoted to the development of domestic 
capabilities for different segments of the renewable 
energy manufacturing and service value chain.
The IRENA-EIB study, completed in 2015, finds that 
Egypt holds a comparative advantage in developing 
its local content for renewable energy projects, 
particularly downstream in the value chain. Several 
local players, including cable manufacturers and EPC 
contractors, have been active within the renewable 
energy market and hold a considerable market share 
for all renewable energy technologies (solar PV, CSP 
and wind). In this context, a local manufacturing 
share of 55% was achieved for the first CSP project 
developed in the country and local players believe 
that this could rise to 70% (EIB and IRENA, 2015).
Furthermore, the FIT scheme was not only able to 
create investment in different renewable energy 
sources, but also by 2017 the two phases of the 
scheme were able to provide about 6 000 direct and 
feeding 350000 homes with clean energy (ENFRWC, 
2017). Solar PV alone contributed 3 000 jobs (IRENA, 
2018b).
The development of an Arab electricity market would 
facilitate tapping into the potential for electricity 
exports to regional, broader African and European 
markets. In turn, this would not only create a larger 
electricity market to benefit from economies of 
scale in renewable energy resource development, 
but would also stimulate the market potential of 
domestic manufacturing across renewables-based 
technologies.
The prevailing tariff structure does not allow for 
the segregation of the cost of service for electricity 
produced from renewables. Furthermore, it does not 
account for the benefits that arise through reduced 
environmental damage (and hence lower costs for 
externalities) based on increasing renewable energy 
use.
The current renewable energy context, where the 
NREA is the main developer of renewable energy 
projects in Egypt through funding from development 
partners, has constrained the development of R&D 
capacity to leverage local manufacturing potential. 
Under a soft loan scheme, the development partners 
do not allow minimum local content requirements to be 
imposed on the projects they fund. In the absence of a 
comprehensive action plan, limited efforts have been 
devoted to developing local capabilities with respect 
to renewable energy technologies, applications, 
marketing, financing and O&M of renewable energy 
systems. Increased involvement of the private sector, 
within the framework of joint ventures, would improve 
this situation by catering towards an increased local 
content in renewable energy projects.
The adoption of thermal biomass technology 
would facilitate switching fuel from natural gas to 
biomethane in gas-fired power plants, using rural and 
agricultural residues for pellet-making and briquetting, 
and switching to biomethane produced from rural 
residues and urban wastes to support local energy 
consumption. For some of the renewable thermal 
applications available, end users lack awareness of 
feasible renewable energy technology/application 
options, local suppliers and service providers, and the Recommended actions:
• Create a national master plan for the development 
of local job creation in the renewable energy 
industry, in collaboration with the Ministry of 
Trade and Industry, the MOF and the MOERE, 
with a specific set of actions defined for solar PV, 
CSP and wind energy technologies.
• Consider developing mechanisms, fully coordinated among all relevant stakeholders in 
the country, to promote local jobs in renewable 
energy, possibly supported by financial and fiscal 
incentive schemes.
• Encourage the establishment of joint ventures 
among industrial actors along the value chain to 
promote local jobs and knowledge and technology 
transfer across solar and wind technologies.
• Establish capacity-building programmes for 
supplier firms and incubators for enterprise 
creation.
• Develop adequate education and training 
programmes to ensure a skilled workforce for the 
renewable energy sector.
• Develop quality standards and corresponding 
certification schemes for the equipment and 
services (installation, maintenance, etc.) related 
to solar systems to ensure their reliability and 
long-term sustainability for final consumers.
• Enhance the availability of public information 
on renewable energy power systems and 
supplement it with more details on the legislation 
governing the renewable energy sector, as well 
as the tendering processes and grid codes (T&D); 
develop contract templates (land use, connection 
contract, network usage, IPP contracts with 
consumers, PPAs). This will require co operation 
between the NREA, EETC, distribution companies, 
EEHC and EgyptERA.
• Put in place a national action plan tailored to 
achieving a range of R&D capabilities on renewable 
energy to support technology development and 
provide a platform for public and private funding. 
The plan should be conceived on a collaborative 
• Undertake regular and intensive capacitybuilding programmes to further develop the 
country’s expertise in renewable energy fields, 
including: solar and wind energy resource 
assessments; planning, design and O&M of 
renewable energy power plants; installation and 
maintenance of distributed renewable energy 
power systems; and monitoring and evaluation 
of the performance of renewable energy power 
plants through certification schemes, including 
specific training targeting the improvement of 
the NREA’s technical capacity.
• Develop technical know-how and training 
on different off-grid electricity applications, 
particularly with regard to water pumping, 
including remote tourist centres.
• Put in place an awareness-raising programme 
that encompasses, among other elements, public 
campaigns, education and training programmes 
tailored to different target groups, such as 
government entities, businesses and the public.
• Ensure decision makers in government and at a 
local level effectively communicate key messages 
on the strong business case for renewable 
energy in the country, as well as the wide range 
of socio-economic benefits of renewable energy 
deployment.
• Design and implement public awarenessraising campaigns, to be co ordinated by the 
NREA, aimed at the public in general, as well 
as focused campaigns aimed at professional 
groups (architects, engineers, developers and 
professionals in construction, hotels, industry and 
municipalities).
• Improve the understanding of the cost and 
benefits of end-user renewable energy 
applications, as well as the relevant technical and 
financial regulations and procedures for installing 
distributed renewable energy power and thermal 
systems (including rooftop solar PV systems and 
solar thermal systems for production processes 
and rooftop SWHs).

ANNEX 1: Comparing 
national energy scenarios
and different energy futures
The Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy to 
2035 for Egypt was developed on the basis of 
several economic and energy indicators in the 
Egyptian energy system, including energy import 
dependency, diversification of the primary energy 
supply, electricity generation, discounted subsidies 
and system costs. As shown in Table 20, comparison 
was made between nine scenarios: Baseline a 
and b, and Scenarios 1a, 1b, 1c, 2, 3, 4a and 4b. 
The “most likely case” of oil and gas production 
was used on the basis of a medium- and longterm perspective of the energy system. Table 20 
presents the score of each of the indicators in the 
respective scenario. A score of 8 in one indicator 
shows that the scenario has the best performance 
for this indicator, while a score of 1 shows that the 
scenario has the worst performance. Tables 20 
and 21 provide a brief description of the scenarios, 
along with the comparative results that facilitated 
the targets set for Egypt.

methodology, assessment 
approach and data sources
This annex details the REmap methodology and 
summarises the key assumptions and methods 
used for the Egypt analysis. REmap is a roadmap 
of technology options to increase the global share 
of renewables. It involves a bottom-up, iterative 
analysis of 70 countries (as of 2017). For selected 
countries, the analysis is deepened and detailed in 
in-depth country reports, working papers or other 
formats. This report is the second to summarise an 
in-depth REmap country analysis with a Renewables 
Readiness Assessment. Therefore, the REmap 
contribution to this report is limited to providing a 
perspective on energy use developments based on 
the REmap analysis that is presented in Chapter 4.
IRENA’s engagement with Egypt on REmap began 
in early 2015. The results of an initial REmap 
analysis for the country were published as part 
of the 2016 global REmap report, “Roadmap for 
a Renewable Energy Future”. In early 2016, the 
REmap team started to revisit the REmap analysis 
of Egypt and expand it to provide a more detailed 
assessment. This effort was aided by an expert 
officer seconded by the NREA to IRENA. This officer 
worked at IRENA’s Bonn office for three months 
supporting the expanded and detailed assessment 
presented in this report. The results of this analysis 
were presented in Cairo in May of 2017 during the 
RRA and REmap workshop. Participants provided 
in-depth views and critique, and the analysis was 
subsequently revised. In September 2017, the 
revised analysis was again shared with the NREA 
and an IRENA consultant for further comment and 
feedback.
The REmap analysis for Egypt utilises IRENA’s 
internally developed REmap tool, incorporating 
data and analysis done by IRENA and Egyptian 
experts for energy developments and renewable 
potential in the country. It provides assumptions and 
a standardised REmap approach for assessment of 
technologies in terms of their cost, investment and 
benefits.
The REmap analysis looks out to the year 2030 
(consistent with the Egyptian calendar year 
2029/30). The year is chosen as the standard 
assessment timeframe for REmap due to it being in 
the medium term, a common year for global efforts 
such as the Sustainable Development Goals, and 
a common year in Egypt for national-level targets 
(for 2029/30).
The REmap analysis starts by building the energy 
balance of a country, using 2014 as the base year of 
the analysis (2013/14), based on national data and 
statistics, other literature and sources. The country 
then provides its latest national energy plans and 
scenarios for renewables and fossil fuels, collated 
to produce a baseline perspective of the energy 
system, referred to as the Reference Case. This 
includes TFEC for each end-use sector (buildings, 
industry and transport) and distinguishes between 
power, district heating and direct uses of energy 
with a breakdown by energy carrier for the period 
2014–2030.
Once the Reference Case is complete, the potential 
for additional renewable energy by technology is 
investigated for each sector. The potential of these 
technologies is described as REmap Options.15 Each 
REmap Option replaces a non-renewable energy 
technology16 to deliver the same energy service. 
The resulting case when all of these options are 
aggregated is called the REmap Case (or sometimes 
just REmap).Throughout this study, the renewable energy share 
is estimated in relation to TFEC17 in general, but 
also occasionally as TPES to allow for comparison 
with targets or indicators that instead focus on 
primary energy. Modern renewable energy excludes 
traditional uses of bioenergy.18 The share of modern 
renewable energy in TFEC is equal to total modern 
renewable energy consumption in end-use sectors 
(including consumption of renewable electricity 
and district heat, and direct uses of renewables), 
divided by TFEC. The share of renewables in power 
generation is also calculated. The renewable energy 
share can also be expressed in terms of the direct 
uses of renewables only. Renewable energy use by 
end-use sector covers the areas described below:
• Buildings includes the residential, commercial 
and public sectors. Renewable energy is used 
in direct applications for heating, cooling or 
cooking purposes or as renewable electricity.
• Industry (or industrial) includes the 
manufacturing and mining sectors, in which 
renewable energy is consumed in direct-use 
applications (e.g. process heat or refrigeration) 
and as electricity from renewable sources. It 
also includes agriculture.
• Transport can make direct use of renewables 
through the consumption of liquid and gaseous 
biofuels or through electricity generated using 
renewable energy technologies.
Metrics for assessing REmap Options
To assess the costs of REmap Options, substitution 
costs are calculated. This report also discusses the 
costs and savings of renewable energy deployment 
and related externalities due to climate change and 
air pollution. For this report there are three main 
indicators: substitution costs, system costs, and 
total investment needs.
Substitution costs
Each renewable technology has its own individual 
cost relative to the non-renewable energy that it 
replaces. This is explained in detail in the REmap 
methodology (IRENA, 2014a) and is depicted in the 
following equation:
For each REmap Option, the analysis considers 
the cost of substituting a non-renewable energy 
technology to deliver an identical amount of heat, 
electricity or energy service. The cost of each 
REmap Option is represented by its substitution 
cost:19,
20
This indicator provides a comparable metric for all 
renewable energy technologies identified in each 
sector. Substitution costs are the key indicators for 
assessing the economic viability of REmap Options. 
They depend on the type of conventional technology 
substituted, energy prices and the characteristics of the 
REmap Option. The cost can be positive (additional) 
or negative (savings) because many renewable energy 
technologies are, or could be, more cost-effective by 
2030 than conventional technologies.
17 TFEC is the energy delivered to consumers as electricity, heat or fuels that can be used directly as a source of energy. This consumption is usually subdivided 
into transport, industry, residential, commercial and public buildings, and agriculture. It excludes non-energy uses of fuels.
18 The FAO defines traditional biomass use as woodfuels, agricultural by-products and dung burned for cooking and heating purposes (FAO, 2000). In developing 
countries, traditional biomass is still widely harvested and used in an unsustainable, inefficient and unsafe way. It is mostly traded informally and noncommercially. Modern biomass, by contrast, is produced in a sustainable manner from solid wastes and residues from agriculture and forestry and relies on 
more efficient methods (IEA and World Bank, 2015).
19 Substitution cost is the difference between the annualised cost of the REmap Option and the annualised cost of the substituted non
renewable technology

-System costs
On the basis of the substitution cost, inferences 
can be made as to the effect on system costs. This 
indicator is the sum of the differences between 
the total capital and operating expenditures of all 
energy technologies based on their deployment in 
REmap and the Reference Case in 2030.
Investment needs
Investment needs for renewable energy capacity 
also can be assessed. The total investment needs 
of technologies in REmap are higher than in 
the Reference Case due to the increased share 
of renewables. On average, these have greater 
investment needs than the non-renewable energy 
technology equivalent. The capital investment cost 
in USD per kW of installed capacity in each year 
is multiplied with the deployment in that year to 
arrive at total annual investment costs. The capital 
investment costs of each year are then added up for 
the period 2015–2030. Net incremental investment 
needs are the sum of the differences between 
the total investment costs for all renewable and 
non-renewable energy technologies in power 
generation and stationary applications in REmap 
and the Reference Case in the period 2015–2030 for 
each year. This total was then turned into an annual 
average for the period.
Externality analysis
Externality cost assessments are considered looking 
at the impact of the REmap Option. They include 
health effects from outdoor air pollution (or indoor 
exposure to pollution in the case of traditional 
bioenergy), as well as effects on agricultural yields. 
In addition, the external costs associated with the 
social and economic impacts of CO2
 are estimated

Further documentation and a detailed description 
of the REmap methodology can be found at www.
irena.org/remap. Further details on metrics for 
assessing REmap Options can be consulted in the 
appendix of the 2016 global report (IRENA, 2016a).
Main sources of information and assumptions
The following key sources have been used to 
prepare the REmap analysis for Egypt:
• Base year 2014: Egyptian energy statistics 
provided by the government were used. Any 
gaps in data were filled using either IEA Energy 
Statistics or GlobalData.
• Reference Case: The report by the European 
Delegation of the European Union to Egypt 
Technical Assistance to Support the Reform of 
the Energy Sector for Egypt (TARES), “Scenario 
Results from the National Energy Model” (EU, 
2015c) was used in part for the Reference 
Case, specifically the Baseline Scenario results; 
the Reference Case was also subsequently 
revised based on country expert feedback and 
consultation.
• REmap Options: The REmap Options are based 
on a variety of sources, including: country 
consultation and feedback from the NREA 
loaned officer seconded to IRENA; the May 
2017 validation workshop; NREA feedback 
and consultation; TARES results for Scenarios 
3b and 4; and IRENA analysis. Further analysis 
was based on IRENA studies exploring the 
potential of renewables in different sectors. 
These studies included: “Renewable Energy 
in Manufacturing” (IRENA, 2014b); “The 
Renewable Route to Sustainable Transport” 
(IRENA, 2016b); and technology briefs on EVs 
(IRENA, 2017e), biogas for cooking (IRENA, 
2017f), liquid biofuel production (IRENA and 
ETSAP, 2017), solar heat for industrial processes 
(IRENA and ETSAP, 2015a) and solar heating 
and cooling for residential applications (IRENA 
and ETSAP, 2015b).
