About the RRA
A Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a holistic evaluation of a country’s conditions that helps to identify 
the actions needed to overcome barriers to renewable energy deployment. This is a country-led process, with IRENA 
primarily providing technical support and expertise to facilitate consultations among different national stakeholders. 
While the RRA helps to shape appropriate policy and regulatory choices, each country determines the best mix of 
renewable energy sources and technologies to achieve national priorities. The RRA is a dynamic process that can 
be adapted to each country’s circumstances and needs. IRENA has continually refined its methodology for the RRA 
process based on experience in a growing range of countries and regions.

ABBREVIATIONSCaucasus mountain, Xinaliq (Khinalug) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Azerbaijan is a fast-developing economy, mostly driven by developments 
in the oil and natural gas sectors, with a GDP per capita that has risen from 
USD 1 237 in 1990 to USD 4 147 in 2017. However, GDP growth has slowed 
due to the substantial drop in oil prices in recent years, resulting in the 
devaluation of the national currency and a fall in GDP from USD 75 billion in 
2014 to USD 41 billion in 2017. In the same year, the oil sector still accounted 
for about a third of GDP.
In recent decades, the country has undergone a steady diversification of 
its economy, with the share of secondary economic activities growing from 
almost 33% of GDP in 1990 to 52% in 2016, while primary activities decreased 
from 29% in 1990 to 6% in 2016. Considering the volatility of oil prices, there 
is a pressing need to further diversify the economy of Azerbaijan and move 
towards a modernised energy system.
The Strategic Roadmap on National Economic Perspectives (approved by 
Presidential Decree on 6 December 2016) calls for an increase in the share of 
non-oil sector foreign direct investment (FDI) from 1.5% to 4% by 2025, and 
an increase in the share of non-oil sector exports from USD 200 per capita in 
2016 to USD 450 by 2025 and USD 1 200 by 2035.
Renewable energy could play an important role in supporting this drive 
for economic diversification. Globally, the goal to limit the rise in global 
temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels 
requires that renewables provide for two-thirds of energy consumption and 
86% of power generation by 2050. This transformation would also deliver 
a growth in global GDP of 2.5% and a 0.2% increase in global employment, 
compared to a business-as-usual scenario (IRENA, 2019).
Azerbaijan is a country with vast potential for renewable energy 
development. The country has excellent wind and solar resources and 
significant prospects for biomass, geothermal and hydropower. With a view 
to unlocking this potential, the government has already set a target of adding 
420 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2020. Driven by this target, the 
country has proceeded to deploy projects using engineering, procurement 
and construction (EPC) contracts. Practical deployment has been limited, 
however, compared to the scale of the country’s available resources and 
long-term ambitions.
A higher share of renewable energy in the energy mix can offer multiple 
benefits beyond economic diversification. Renewable energy can act as 
a catalyst for new employment opportunities in a country traditionally 
dominated by oil and gas, providing avenues for technological innovation 
and opening new sectors for economic value creation and associated GDP 
growth. Furthermore, the accelerated deployment of renewable energy, 
coupled with continuing improvements in energy efficiency, could decrease 
domestic consumption of oil and gas, providing opportunities to generate 
additional revenue through exports and reduce domestic subsidies.
Given the projected increase in energy demand in Azerbaijan, renewable 
energy also provides a technical solution to deploy power generation 
capacity more rapidly due to the relatively shorter lead times for project 
construction compared to conventional sourcesRenewables also offer the most prominent low carbon 
solution to meeting Azerbaijan’s climate targets. The 
country has committed to reducing its GHG emissions 
by 35% by 2030, measured from the 1990 base year 
set in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) 
under the Paris Agreement, which emphasises the use 
of alternative and renewable energy sources to achieve 
this target.
To support Azerbaijan in unlocking its renewable energy 
potential, this report presents nine recommendations 
that provide a solid basis for creating a more conducive 
investment environment for renewable energy:
Adopt a renewable energy law
A dedicated law could provide overall direction to the 
renewable energy sector in Azerbaijan and significantly 
contribute to the development of a local market for 
renewables. Such a law would serve as an important 
reference point for renewable energy market players 
by providing a clear and reliable long-term perspective. 
Currently, the Ministry of Energy of the Republic 
of Azerbaijan, with the support of an international 
consulting company, is developing a draft law on the 
use of renewable energy sources in power generation.
The law will cover all key elements of a sound legal and 
regulatory framework for renewable energy by defining 
the most appropriate sources and technologies based 
on the existing technical potential in Azerbaijan. 
In addition, the law could also allocate roles and 
responsibilities to relevant government entities.
Streamline permitting procedures for
renewable energy
Permitting requirements and procedures could be 
streamlined under the renewable energy law to provide 
reference and direction for any future amendments. 
The overarching principles for the design of permitting 
procedures are simplicity, transparency and the 
flexibility to adapt to regulatory and market changes.
The establishment of a ‘one-stop shop’ system for 
renewable energy projects could be considered 
to simplify and streamline the permitting process. 
Publishing permit procedures online, alongside 
information on the different steps to take, would 
increase transparency for developers and investors.
Enhance the procurement of renewable energy
A holistic approach to the design of support mechanisms 
for renewable energy, encompassing power and nonpower sectors, will be beneficial to the development 
of renewables in Azerbaijan. Given the country’s varied 
renewable energy potentialtariff support could be 
Azerbaijan is working towards conducting renewable 
energy auctions. In this regard, the Ministry of 
Energy is undertaking steps, including on-the-ground 
measurements, to define and prioritise zones with high 
renewable energy resource intensity,. Eight zones (five 
wind and three solar) with total capacity of 750 MW 
have already been identified. Preliminary assessments 
on ownership and designation of lands, potential 
environmental impacts and existing infrastructure have 
been conducted in these areas.
Set up a dedicated financing mechanism 
to address off-taker risk
Azerbaijan could benefit from creating facilitation 
mechanisms for financing renewable energy projects 
that will enable the development of the renewable 
energy market, especially in its initial phases. Dedicated 
financing facilities for renewable energy projects could 
alleviate some of the barriers to this development and 
enhance the country’s attractiveness to both local and 
international project developers and investors.
One option is to create a dedicated fund to support 
renewable energy projects, which could be capitalised 
through a levy on conventional energy sources and 
disbursed through a robust off-taker arrangement. The 
Government of Azerbaijan could also consider creating 
a risk mitigation facility to encourage investment. Such 
a facility could provide guarantees for viable projects 
and collaborate with local banks to help build their 
knowledge of, and capacity for, renewable energy 
project financing.
Adopt a standard power purchasing
agreement (PPA)
Drafting and publishing a standard PPA for renewable 
projects will help to reduce the risk perceived by 
the private sector and improve transparency and 
predictability in Azerbaijan’s renewable energy market. 
Robust PPAs can improve the economics of renewable 
energy projects, while suboptimal PPAs, on the other 
hand, may increase the costs of procurement. 
The Ministry of Energy, in collaboration with an 
international consulting firm, has developed a draft 
standard PPA that considers best practices and reflects 
close consultation with stakeholders. Negotiations 
with private sector companies are underway to start 
implementing pilot projects through the PPA.
Develop long-term energy scenarios
To identify the optimal energy mix and inform policy 
decisions accordingly, a detailed long-term planning 
exercise could be undertaken for energy demand in the 
electricityindustryresidentialcommercialagricultural If the potential for electrification, energy efficiency and 
renewable energy penetration is to be fully assessed, 
Azerbaijan’s energy planning requires a deeper focus 
on non-power sectors, such as heating and cooling, and 
transport.
Such analysis will assess the costs and benefits of 
different renewable energy technologies (solar, wind, 
bioenergy, etc.), including their potential for market 
penetration and optimal scale of deployment. This 
requires an assessment of the technical and economic 
renewable energy potential by technology to outline 
future scenarios with increased shares of renewable 
energy. There is also a need to comprehensively assess 
current energy infrastructure, focusing on aspects 
such as the country’s power grid and the investments 
needed for grid upgrades.
Adopt a long-term renewable energy target
Targets enhance the transparency of the policy-making 
process by providing a common information base 
to all stakeholders, thereby fostering public support. 
When backed by supportive policy and investment 
frameworks, targets can be instrumental in indicating 
the envisioned trajectory of market growth, thereby 
helping to anchor medium and long-term expectations. 
By giving a sense of trajectory and growth, they 
can contribute to lowering deployment costs and 
establishing a supply chain utilising local industry.
While Azerbaijan has already approved its renewable 
energy target for 2020, the government is considering 
a longer-term target to increase the share of renewable 
energy in power generation up to 30% by 2030. This 
could offer better long-term clarity for the private sector 
and investors, thereby encouraging the development 
of new projects. To realise the potential of renewables 
in multiple uses, targets would need to be set for the 
heating, cooling, transport and power sectors.
Develop and implement a grid connection
code with standards for variable renewable 
energy integration
The Government of Azerbaijan could provide the 
mandate for relevant organisations to develop a grid 
connection code for variable renewable energy (VRE) 
in consultation with all relevant actors. The function 
of a grid connection code including VRE is to provide 
technical requirements for wind and PV plants when 
connecting to a country’s electricity grid. 
This helps to ensure the quality and standardisation of 
equipment, as well as the fair treatment of generators 
and operators with regard to grid connection, while 
also maintaining system stability and reliability.
The establishment of a country-wide grid code 
could improve overall grid management, which 
will have a positive impact on the development of 
renewable energy by reducing the perceived technical 
risks for investors and developers. The Ministry of 
Energy, with the support of the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the 
involvement of a consulting firm, has implemented a 
project, “Strengthening the grid to support renewable 
energy projects in Azerbaijan”, to identify potential 
of renewable energy resources and opportunities for 
integrating them into the grid.
Raise awareness and develop a capacity 
building strategy
The government could devise a long-term programme 
of activities to increase general awareness of, and 
capacity for, renewable energy, targeted at state 
institutions, local enterprises and citizens. Such a 
programme could also integrate certifications in 
training curricula, with a focus on building local skills 
in operation and maintenance to enhance employment 
opportunities. Additionally, certification and training 
on various renewable energy applications and related 
technologies for both power and non-power uses may 
be beneficial.
Government institutions could benefit from specialised 
capacity building on renewable energy policy and 
regulation, and evaluation techniques for renewable 
energy projects. For the private sector, courses could 
be offered explaining opportunities for setting up 
renewable energy enterprises, including information on 
available government support schemes and partners. 
Increased understanding of the benefits of renewable 
energy and how they are relevant to the overall 
economic situation in Azerbaijan could be useful for the 
wider public.
Annually the Ministry of Energy and the State Agency for 
Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources (SAARES) 
implement activities to raise public awareness on the 
use of renewable energy and the production of carbonfree electricity. Baku, Azerbaijan

1.1. Country Background
The Republic of Azerbaijan is located in the southern Caucasus region. It is 
bordered by the Caspian Sea to the east, Armenia and Georgia to the west, 
the Russian Federation to the north and Iran to the south. The population was 
approximately 10 million in 2019 with about 45% still living in rural areas. Baku 
is the capital and the largest city, with a population of about 2.5 million.
Azerbaijan is a fast-developing economy, largely oriented toward developments 
in the oil and natural gas sectors, and achieved its highest economic growth at 
the beginning of the 2010s. Its GDP per capita (in current USD) increased from 
USD 1 237 in 1990 to USD 4 147 in 2017.
However, GDP growth has slowed since the plunge in oil prices in 2013. The 
subsequent erosion of oil prices has resulted in the devaluation of the national 
currency and led to a fall in the country’s GDP from USD 75 billion in 2014 to 
USD 41 billion in 2017. The oil sector still accounted for about one third of GDP 
in 2017. The country’s unemployment levels have remained stable; 5.63% of 
the population was unemployed in 2010, falling to 5.03% in 2017. In recent 
decades, the country’s economy has undergone significant diversification 
(Table 1).the relevant opportunities and constraints.
Given both the current global economic slowdown and the fact that oil prices 
remain volatile and well below their mid-2008 peak, there is a pressing need to 
further diversify the economy of Azerbaijan, and therefore to move towards a 
modernised energy system. This is compounded by the fact that oil production 
has been progressively declining, having reached its peak in 2010 (IEA, 2015).

Economic Perspectives (approved by Presidential Decree 
on 6 December 2016) the target Indicators are:
(i) increasing the share of non-oil sector’s FDI from the 
current 1.5% to 4% by 2025; and (ii) increasing the share 
of non-oil sector exports from the current USD 200 per 
capita to USD 450 per capita by 2025 and USD 1 200 per 
capita by 2035.
Renewable energy could play a role in supporting 
Azerbaijan’s drive for economic diversification. 
Globally, the transformation of the energy system that 
aims to limit the rise in global temperature to well 
below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels 
requires that renewables provide for two-thirds of 
energy consumption and 86% of power generation 
by 2050, adding 2.5% to GDP and a 0.2% increase in 
global employment, compared to a business-as-usual 
tradjectory (IRENA, 2019).
Azerbaijan’s adoption of the Strategic Road Map for the 
development of utilities, approved by the Presidential 
Decree of 6 December 2016, which lays out a long-term 
roadmap for the development of renewables in the 
country (see section 2.6), therefore represents a timely 
step towards energy transformation.
Photograph: ShutterstockThe RRA process in Azerbaijan has produced the 
following outputs:
• an analysis of the existing policy environment and 
renewable energy market; 
• identification of the critical and emerging issues 
associated with renewable energy development; 
and 
• a set of recommendations for taking advantage of 
the opportunities revealed by the policy analysis 
and extensive consultations with numerous 
stakeholders. 
The co-ordinated approach employed to produce this 
RRA helps in setting priorities, in consultation with 
bilateral and multilateral cooperation agencies, financial 
institutions and the private sector, for implementing the 
recommended actions.
1.2. Renewables Readiness 
 Assessment (RRA)
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) 
developed the Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) 
as a tool for carrying out comprehensive evaluations 
of the conditions for renewable energy deployment 
in particular countries. The RRA is a country-led, 
consultative process. It provides a venue for multistakeholder dialogue to identify challenges to renewable 
energy deployment and to devise solutions to existing 
barriers. Short and medium-term recommendations are 
presented to governments to guide the formation of new 
policies or the reform of existing policies to achieve a 
more enabling environment for renewable energy.
For Azerbaijan, the RRA process has been led by the 
Government of Azerbaijan, with technical support from 
IRENA, and has greatly benefitted from stakeholder 
input. These stakeholders include the Ministry of Energy, 
transmission and distribution utilities, power project 
developers, development partners, financial institutions, 
civil society and academia. The consultative process 
was initiated at an expert consultation workshop held in 
Baku on 31 May–1 June 2018. The workshop was based 
on a background paper describing the challenges and 
opportunities for renewable energy development.
During this two-day event, experts discussed the state 
of renewable energy in Azerbaijan, as well as various 
challenges and possible solutions. Their insights informed 
a draft report presented in the follow-up validation 
workshop held on 16 October 2018, which was jointly 
organised by the State Agency for Alternative and 
Renewable Energy Sources (SAARES) and IRENA. In 
addition, the analysis benefitted from bilateral interviews 
with key stakeholders and from the Renewable Energy 
Hard Talk in Azerbaijan organised by the United Nations 
Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in October 
2017. 2. ENERGY CONTEXT
2.1. Energy sector
Azerbaijan is a net energy exporter. The country exports oil, natural gas and 
electricity. Azerbaijan meets its energy needs through domestic production, 
which is currently largely reliant on the exploitation of the country’s 
hydrocarbon reserves – namely oil and natural gas. Proven oil reserves in 
the Caspian Basin – which Azerbaijan shares with Russia, Kazakhstan, 
Turkmenistan and Iran – were reported at seven billion barrels in 2018 (OPEC, 
2018) and are comparable in size to North Sea reserves several decades ago. 
Table 2 illustrates that Azerbaijan exports five times its own total final energy 
consumption (TFEC). The decrease in the primary production of renewables 
and waste relates to fluctuating hydropower generation and reduced 
usage of wood as a feedstock for energy use. Reduced wood usage can be 
attributed to improvements in district heating and installation of gas-fired 
water heaters.

Source: State Statistical Committee of Azerbaijan (2018).Energy consumption
As shown in Table 3, TFEC is concentrated in 
households, as well as the transport, industry, and 
construction sectors, in order of importance. The share 
of households decreased between 2010 and 2017 
from 50% to 41%, while the share of the transport, 
industry and construction sectors increased from 37% 
to almost 45% over the same period. The decrease in 
the share of residential consumption is the result of 
a combination of factors – most notably the surge in 
energy consumption in the industry and transportation 
sectors. The growing energy consumption in these 
end-use sectors highlights their critical importance in 
Azerbaijan’s transition to sustainable energy.
Heating has a major role in determining the country’s 
energy mix, particularly in industry and households 
for space heating and cooking. Azerbaijan uses both 
individual and district heating solutions, the latter 
typically comprising small decentralised heat supply 
systems where each apartment block is connected to 
a central boiler using natural gas. Currently, the vast 
majority of households in Azerbaijan use gas-based 
central heating or stoves. District heating is managed 
by the state-owned supply operator Azeristiliktechizat, 
with only limited changes to its energy mix or 
infrastructure upgrades. 
The share of the various energy products in TFEC is 
presented in Figure 1. Natural gas and petroleum clearly 
dominate the mix, representing more than 80% of the 
TFEC. Renewable sources and municipal waste remain 
below 3% of the TFEC.
Energy subsidies
Azerbaijan still has a sizable energy subsidy system in 
place. The cost of the energy subsidy was equivalent 
to almost 3.4% of GDP in 2016, with an average energy 
subsidy estimated at USD 130 per capita (see Table 
4). The total value of subsidies almost doubled in the 
period between 2014 and 2016 from USD 751 million 
to USD 1 269 million. In 2015 and 2016, more than half 
of the subsidies were provided to the electricity sector 
through support to oil and gas energy sources, while 
subsidies to renewable energy were negligible.

2.2. Electricity sector
Azerbaijan has a 100% electrification rate. The country 
currently has about 7 141 MW of total installed capacity; 
this is dominated by thermal power, which constitutes 
about 60%. The Azerbaijan TPP – the largest power 
plant with a capacity of about 2 400 MW (oil-based) 
– is being refurbished to meet industry design 
requirements for reliability and economy. The remaining 
thermal power plants are modern, mostly operating 
on combined-cycle gas turbine technology. Among 
renewables, hydropower has the highest installed 
capacity (1 134 MW in 2019) followed by wind (66 MW), 
biomass (38 MW) and solar photovoltaic (33 MW). 
Electricity generation
More than 80% of the total electricity produced by 
Azerenerji, the state-owned power generation and 
transmission company, comes from thermal power 
plants. Of these, combined-cycle power plants provide 
over 40% of total electricity production. Hydropower 
plants provide for about 6–10% of electricity generation 
demand. Table 5 presents electricity generation data by 
source.
The Azerbaijan electricity system has a substantial 
amount of overcapacity in the generation sector. The 
system peak load in 2017 was 3 509 MW, while the 
installed capacity, excluding the Shirvan TPP, is around 
6 000 MW, which provides a considerable opportunity 
for electricity export. 
Electricity consumption
An overview of the country’s electricity consumption 
by sector is provided in Figure 2. Households, and 
commerce and public services, are the two largest 
consumers of electricity, with a combined share of 89% 
of total consumption in 2017. The third largest consumer 
is industry, driven by non-ferrous metallurgy, iron and 
steel metallurgy, and food processing industries.

The system has excess 
power generation 
capacityElectricity trading
Azerbaijan conducts cross-border electricity trading
with neighbouring countries, mainly exporting 
electricity to Georgia and Turkey. Azerbaijan is a net 
exporter of electricity and exported about 1 billion kWh 
in 2016 and 2017, leveraging its excess electricity 
generation capacity.
Electricity exports account for approximately 5% of the 
country›s electricity production. In general, electricity 
exports accounted for about 0.4% of the total exports 
of Azerbaijan in USD value in 2017, amounting to 
USD 51 million. The electricity trade with Iran is roughly 
balanced, while the export–import balance with 
Georgia, Russia and Turkey is positive.
The project was based on an analysis of the power 
systems of the three countries. Azerbaijan and Georgia 
have excess generating capacity, while Turkey has 
rapidly growing demand for electricity.
During the first year of Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey 
(AGT) project operations, Turkey was the main trading 
partner for Azerbaijan’s electricity exports (totalling 
about 800 million kWh).1
 In 2017, Georgia took the lead 
with a purchase of 900 million kWh of electricity from 
Azerbaijan.
Table 6 shows Azerbaijan’s electricity exports and 
imports.
1 The Azerbaijan–Georgia–Turkey Project (“AGT Power Bridge”) was initiated by Azerenerji JSC (generation and transmission system 
operator of Azerbaijan), GSE JSC (TSO of Georgia) and TEIAS (TSO of Turkey) in 2009 for electricity delivery from Azerbaijan to Turkey 
though Georgia.

Azerbaijan’s institutional landscape in the energy 
sector is still evolving. The energy sector has undergone 
several phases of restructuring since Azerbaijan’s 
independence in the early 1990s, focusing mainly on 
the power sector.
Key institutions
The Ministry of Energy oversees state policy and 
regulation in the energy sector, including renewable 
energy. The Ministry also has control over state-owned 
enterprises. The main function of the Ministry of Energy 
is to ensure the country’s energy security, participating 
in the formation of the state policy for energy sector 
development and its implementation. The Ministry of 
Energy is also responsible for the licensing of power 
generation, transmission, distribution and sale, as well 
as import and export activities. The Ministry has a 
dedicated department that is responsible for increasing 
the deployment of energy efficiency and renewable 
energy policies.
The State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy 
Sources (SAARES) was established by a Presidential 
Decree on July 16, 2009, and was subsequently 
tasked with driving the development of the country’s 
renewable energy resources and related projects. The 
status of the Agency was altered by Presidential Decree 
No. 464 of 14 January 2019.
The Tariff Council determines and regulates retail and 
wholesale tariffs for electricity, gas, central heating 
services and refined petroleum products. The Council 
was established in May 2005 and implements state 
regulations on prices and service fees pertaining to 
public services and their collection in cooperation with 
central and local executive bodies as well as public 
organisations. The Council is chaired by the Minister 
of Economy; representatives of several ministries and 
agencies are also appointed members of the Council.
The Azerbaijan Energy Regulatory Agency (AERA) was 
created by Presidential decree on 22 December 2017 
with the objective of pursuing energy sector unbundling 
and preparing tariffs for approval by the Tariff Council.
Structure of the power sector 
The power sector was originally a fully vertically 
and horizontally integrated monopoly, except for 
distribution and supply in the Baku region, which 
was a municipal entity managed by Baku Networks 
Company (Bakielektrikshebeke OJSC). On 10 February 
2015, Azerishiq JSC was created to take over the 
responsibilities and roles of Bakielektrikshebeke OJSC, 
and later became the national power distribution 
company.
Azerenerji OJSC is responsible for generation and 
transmission of electricity in the country, including 
coordination of power substations controlled via a 
national dispatch centre, as well as high voltage power 
transmission lines of 110, 220, 330, 500 kV and their 
dispatch control tools. Azerenerji OJSC introduces 
new technologies to ensure extension of generation 
capacity and rehabilitation of high voltage power lines 
in the country. At the same time, it conducts energy 
exchange operations with foreign countries.
In recent years, Azerenerji has implemented a largescale investment programme to add new – and 
upgrade existing – generation and transmission 
capacity. All investments in the distribution network 
are implemented by Azerishiq, which carries out large 
scale rehabilitation of infrastructure and works on the 
electrification programme for residential communities. 
An overview of power flows is detailed in Figure 3. 
In addition, there are a few private companies operating 
small hydropower stations and wind power stations, 
as well as solar home systems. Azguntex LLC is a 
government-owned company that manufactures solar 
panels and LED lamps.

operator. The district heating in Azerbaijan typically 
comprises small decentralised heat supply systems 
serving a number of apartment blocks from a single 
gas-fired boiler house.
The key actors involved in the electricity and natural gas 
sectors of Azerbaijan, with relevance to the purposes of 
the present analysis, are listed in Annex 1.
2.4. Strategic framework
In July 2015, the Minister of Energy of Azerbaijan 
approved a set of ten priority directions that aim to 
introduce market-based operations in the electricity 
and natural gas sectors, with a view to attracting 
private investment (Table 7). The market reforms aim 
to harness competitive market forces to achieve energy 
prices that reflect actual costs and thereby increase 
economic benefits for the whole country.
The development of six of these ten strategic tasks 
have been supported by international development 
partners (see Annex 2 for a list of projects implemented 
in support of these strategic priorities).
The strategic roadmap for the development of utilities 
(electricity, heating, water and gas) in the Republic of 
Azerbaijan was approved by the Presidential Decree 
of 6 December 2016, “About approval of the strategic 
roadmaps for the national economy and main economic 
sectors”.
The roadmap was outlined for short-term, 
including an Action Plan of measures, (up to 
2020), medium-term (2020–2025) and long-term 
(post-2025) periods.
With regards to renewable energy, the strategy sets a 
target of 420 MW by 2020, which includes 350 MW of 
wind, 50 MW of solar and 20 MW of bioenergy. The 
strategy also includes a long-term vision for 2025 and 
beyond; however, no specific targets are set beyond 
2020.
This long-term vision establishes a framework for a 
wide series of measures and sectoral reforms that 
include the development of a favourable climate for 
attracting investments in renewable energy (mainly 
wind and solar); distributed power generation by 
consumers for self-sufficiency and the installation of 
rooftop PV panels; and the development of bioenergy 
and geothermal resources.
The development of distributed generation is also 
planned, using solar PV, small combined heat and power 
(CHP) stations, and small wind turbines. At the consumer 
level, the long-term vision envisages improved energy 
efficiency in the industrial and commercial sectors, and 
the development of infrastructure for electric vehicles.

legislation.
Creation of a flexible tariff system, reflecting and distributing the interests of end consumers and other market actors (X-factor), 
and based on the costs of products and services.2.5. Legal, regulatory and policy
 framework
The legal and regulatory framework of the Azerbaijan 
power sector has evolved over the past 20 years. In 
that period, some elements of legal and regulatory 
frameworks have been updated to account for intended 
changes to their structure and administration, such as 
the drive to introduce a competitive power market 
through the unbundling of the vertically integrated 
market and greater private sector participation. The 
energy sector of Azerbaijan is governed by legislation 
that was drafted during the period 1998–2000. The key 
elements of the legislation are summarised below.
Law on Energy Resources Utilisation
(30 May 1996)
The Law on Energy Resources Utilisation determines 
the legal, economic and social basis of state policy in 
the field of energy resource utilisation and regulates the 
relations between the state and the legal entities in this 
field. The Law includes provisions on the certification 
and standardisation of energy consuming installations, 
facilities, etc. It also states that independent electric 
and thermal power producers may use the state power 
supply system to transport produced energy under 
negotiated terms.
Law on Power Industry (3 April 1998)
The Law on Power Industry provides the legal background 
for the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of 
electricity and heating. It mainly aims to ensure rational 
utilisation of power resources as well as environmental 
protection. The Law appoints the Ministry of Energy as 
the authority responsible for licensing and regulating 
electricity generation, transmission, distribution, sale, 
and import–export activities.
Law on Heat and Electric Power Plants
(6 March 2000)
This Law determines the legal framework for the design, 
construction and operation of power plants including 
independent power plants. The purchase of electricity 
generated by small power plants is guaranteed without 
limitations.2
 Any natural or legal entity has the right 
to construct, rehabilitate and operate power plants, 
and activities related to “industrial power plants” (i.e. 
excluding small power plants) must be licenced by the 
Ministry of Energy. The Law also provides for the process 
and conditions of negotiated access and connection of 
such licenced facilities to the grid.
Additional legal and regulatory documents
The power sector is also regulated by a number of 
byelaws (mainly the Cabinet of Ministries Decrees 
concerning various rules and procedures for operations). 
There are a number of bye-laws aimed at promoting the 
use of renewable energy through special concessions, 
including the following:
• The State Program on the Use of Alternative and 
Renewable Energy Sources, adopted in 2004, aims 
to: 1) determine the potential of alternative energy 
sources in the production of electricity; 2) increase 
the efficiency of national energy sources; 3) guarantee 
national energy security; 4) decrease CO2
 emissions; 
and 5) support job creation via renewable energy 
sector development.
• March 2014 amendments to the Cabinet of Ministers 
decrees: “Rates of custom duties on export–import 
operations in Azerbaijan Republic” and “List of goods 
exempted of VAT imported to Azerbaijan Republic 
territory”. The import of equipment, facilities, parts 
and tools used in the renewable energy industry and in 
achieveing energy efficiency are exempt from customs 
duties and VAT.
• Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers “On determination 
of electricity production and power limits for the 
commissioning of electrical installations” – no. 482 
of 24 November 2016. According to this decree, 
special permits for alternative and renewable energy 
power plants are required only for power plants with 
a capacity of more than 150 kW, and for hydropower 
plants and biogas power plants with a capacity of more 
than 500 kW.
• The permitting procedure for renewable energy 
remains complex, with a number of steps and 
fragmented division of responsibilities across Ministries 
and local administration. Figure 4 outlines this process.

The Azerbaijani Service and Assessment Network 
(ASAN) is a state agency for public services to 
the citizens of Azerbaijan. The agency’s goal is to 
make services more easily accessible to citizens 
using modern technologies. The ASAN service is 
based around a ‘one-stop-shop’ principle, where 
ten government entities and about 30 private 
companies provide services in a public–private 
partnership.
The President of Azerbaijan has already approved 
the rules for the use of electricity through the 
Decree of 4 April 2017 “on simplification of 
procedures of electricity supply for existing or new 
constructed facilities of entrepreneurs”. The decree 
sets out the rules for the preparation of technical 
specifications and design estimates for existing 
or under-construction facilities with the required 
capacity of up to 150 kW (including 150 kW from 
the existing 0.4 kV network) and connection to 
the power supply network. Consumers can easily 
request such connections through the ASAN 
service.Table 8: Tariffs for electricity (28 November 2016)

2.6. Energy tariffs
Tariffs for electricity and heating are regulated by the 
state in Azerbaijan, specifically purchase prices from 
producers; wholesale prices; retail prices and import–
export prices (for electricity). There are no access tariffs 
for generation/retailing and transmission/distribution. 
The Tariff Council has the power to set tariffs for any 
kind of renewable energy. Feed-in tariffs have been 
set for wind, mini hydro and other renewable energy 
technologies. There is no difference in tariffs between 
cogeneration and standalone power systems. The 
regulated entities (e.g. Azerenergji and Azerishiq) 
are required to provide economic justification for the 
expenses recovered by the tariffs. The calculated tariffs 
are reviewed by the Tariff Council and published upon 
approval.
Depending on the specification of the services, tariffs are 
determined on the basis of the expenses necessary to 
recover costs and generate profits. This is a methodology 
used for the calculation of prices (tariffs) for all services 
and goods regulated by state. There is no dedicated 
methodology for the calculation of tariffs for electricity. 
The latest tariffs were approved by Resolution of the 
Tariff Council no. 17 of 28 November 2016 on the 
Regulation of Electricity Price Rates in the Republic of 
Azerbaijan and are shown in Table 8. 
The country has set specific tariffs for renewable energy, 
namely 2.94 US cents per kWh for small hydropower; 
3.23 US cents for wind; and up to 3.35 US cents for 
other renewable energy technologies. Azerbaijan 
is contemplating the possibility of competitive 
procurement as a mechanism for the discovery of 
appropriate tariffs in this context. Photograph: Shutterstock3. RENEWABLE ENERGY 
 DEVELOPMENT
3.1. Drivers of renewable energy deployment
The country’s leadership highlights the importance of diversifying the 
economy and decreasing its dependence on the oil and gas sectors in its 
Strategic Road Map on National Economic Perspectives. In this context, the 
increased share of renewable energy in the energy mix can offer multiple 
benefits, including improved welfare and job creation, energy security, 
economic diversification and associated increases in GDP. 
Renewable energy can act as a catalyst for new employment opportunities 
in a country traditionally dominated by oil and gas by providing new 
avenues for technological innovation and new sectors for economic value 
creation. The country’s rich experience in the oil and gas sector offers a good 
starting point for the introduction of renewable based technologies. For 
example, elsewhere, oil and gas industry experience has been used in the 
successful development of geothermal potential in Canada, while in Norway, 
the expertise gained from off-shore oil and gas infrastructure have been 
leveraged to develop the off-shore wind industry. 
In the case of Azerbaijan, the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic 
(SOCAR) – the wholly state-owned national oil and gas company – is an 
important actor in the country’s energy sector. While it maintains its focus on 
conventional energy sources, SOCAR has already installed wind and solar PV 
in the Tagiyev oil and gas field and is considering renewable energy options 
for supplying power to off-shore facilities.
Furthermore, the accelerated deployment of renewable energy, coupled 
with continuing improvements in energy efficiency, could decrease domestic 
consumption of oil and gas, thereby providing an opportunity to generate 
additional revenues through exports and lower domestic subsidies. 
Azerbaijan is a country with vast potential for the development of renewable 
energy. The country has excellent wind and solar resources and sizable 
potential for biomass, geothermal and hydropower. With a view to unlocking 
this potential, the government has set a target of adding 420 MW of 
renewable energy capacity by 2020. Driven by this target, the country has 
proceeded with the deployment of projects under engineering, procurement 
and construction (EPC) contracting arrangements for use of renewables. 
However, practical deployment has been limited compared to the scale of 
available resources and the country’s long-term ambitions.Renewables also offer the most prominent low carbon 
solution to meeting Azerbaijan’s climate targets. 
The country has committed to reducing its GHG 
emissions by 35% by 2030 compared to the 1990 base 
year specified in its Nationally Determined Contribution 
(NDC) under the Paris Agreement. The NDC already 
emphasises the use of alternative and renewable 
energy sources to achieve this target.
The development of renewable energy could also 
contribute to energy system resilience in Azerbaijan 
(see Box 2). For example, distributed renewable 
energy systems, combined with increased use of 
battery storage, can enhance security of supply. Given 
the projected increase in national energy demand, 
renewable energy also provides a technical solution 
to the need for rapid power generation capacity 
deployment, owing to relatively shorter lead times for 
project construction when compared to conventional 
sources.
Box 2: Resilience and security of 
 electricity supply
Azerbaijan encountered a massive blackout 
during 3–4 July 2018, leaving large parts of the 
country without electricity and in some cases 
without water supply. Thirty-nine cities and 
districts across the country were affected. The 
blackout was associated with a significant heat 
wave and a parallel explosion at the sub-station 
of a thermal power plant in Mingachevir city. 
The government has allocated significant 
amounts of investment in improvements to its 
electricity infrastructure over the past 15 years 
and activities related to energy security and 
system resilience are continious. The July 2018 
blackout highlighted the need to build a stronger, 
more resilient power system in Azerbaijan, in 
which renewables can play an important role. 
This provides an opportunity to further enhance 
the business case for renewable energy.
Photograph: Shutterstock3.2. Current status and potential
At present, Azerbaijan has a modest share of renewable 
energy in its TFEC, fluctuating between a peak of 3.1% in 
2010 to 1.7% in 2017. One explanation for this variance is 
the seasonal and year-on-year changes in hydropower 
production that have ranged from 3 446 million kWh in 
2010 to only 1 746 million kWh in 2017. 
The share of renewable energy in non-power uses has 
remained consistently low and represented 0.4% of 
TFEC in 2017.

The share of renewable 
energy in non-power 
uses has remained 
consistently low
As of 2017, Azerbaijan has 1 267 MW of installed 
renewable power capacity, of which 1 132 MW is hydro, 
35 MW solar, 62 MW wind and 38 MW is biomass
(See Table 9).
Azerbaijan has exceptional wind and solar resources 
and significant bio/waste, geothermal and small hydro 
potential. SAARES estimates of renewable energy 
technical potential are presented in Table 10.Hydropower
Hydropower has traditionally maintained a solid 
position in the country’s energy mix. Among 
renewables, hydropower had the highest installed 
capacity of 1 131 MW in 2017, compared to 6 750 MW 
of thermal power capacity. The resources are located 
alongside rivers such as the Kura and its tributaries, 
the Araz, streams terminating at the Caspian Sea, and 
irrigation canals. 
Azerbaijan also has a well developed small hydropower 
generation sector (comprising the Sheki, Mughan, 
Zeykhur, Gusar, Nyugedi, Chinarly, Balakan, Guba 
and Zurnabad power plants) with the presence of 
independent power producers as well as autoproducers 
generating power for consumption in their own facilities. 
Small-scale hydro-power generation is still being added 
such as the 1.5 MW Balakan facility in 2017.
Seasonal conditions affect hydropower generation, 
which has fluctuated from a peak of 1 959.3 GWh in 2016 
to a low of 1 299.7 GWh in 2014. While hydropower is 
subject to seasonal fluctuations, however, its substantial 
share in the country’s electricity system offers a strong 
basis for supporting the integration of future solar and 
wind power generation capacity.

Wind energy
Azerbaijan has excellent wind resources, especially 
in coastal areas along the Caspian Sea (Figure 5). 
According to SAARES analysis, the potential for wind is 
estimated at 3 000 MW.
Box 3: Yeni Yashma Wind Park
The Yeni Yashma Wind Park is the first project 
of its kind demonstrating Azerbaijan’s potential 
in this renewable energy technology. The 
Yeni Yashma park was constructed with 20 
Fuhrlander FL 2 500 wind power turbines with 
an installed capacity of 50 MW. The wind power 
park is located in the Khizi region, in the Yeni 
Yashma settlement north of Baku. 
Ownership of the project was transferred 
from SAARES to Azerishiq OJSC, which was 
entrusted with responsibilities related to the 
commissioning of the project, and it began 
operating in October 2018. As of November 
2018, Yeni Yashma is the largest operating wind 
park in the south Caucasus.
This potential is reflected in the governments target 
of 350 MW of new capacity by 2020. By the end of 
2017, 62.4 MW were installed with 51.7 MW operated 
by Azerishiq JS, 2.7 MW by Azalternativenergy LLC, 
and 8 MW by the private sector. Azerbaijan continues 
to develop several projects including the ongoing 
Absheron wind project and the recently launched Yeni 
Yashma wind farm (see Box 3).Figure 6: Annual gobal horizontal solar irradiation (GHI in kWh/m2)

Azerbaijan has an estimated solar energy potential 
of 23 040 MW. The annual number of sunshine hours 
varies between 2 400 and 3 200. Global horizontal 
irradiation (GHI) is in the range of 1 387 to 1 534 kWh/m² 
for most of the territory. The direct normal irradiation 
ranges from 1 095 to 1 534 kWh/m² with most of the 
territory under 1 387 kWh/m².
There are four solar PV installations with an installed 
capacity of more than 1 MW. Nakhchivan Solar Power 
Plant has a capacity of 22 MW. Additionally, plans 
call for the construction of five solar power stations 
at 2.8 MW capacity each and one solar power station
of 4 MW.
As of the end of 2017, 34.6 MW of solar PV was installed 
across the country, including at social establishments 
and on the roofs of various public buildings. An 
example of such projects is the Sport Centre in Masally, 
which has a PV installation of 70 kWp. The system is 
owned by Azalternativenerji – a public company – and 
all related administrative and financial procedures have 
been developed within SAARES. Table 11 lists some 
additional examples.Bioenergy
Azerbaijan has an estimated technical potential of 
380 MW for biomass and waste-to-energy. Currently, 
bioenergy is mostly utilised in the form of traditional 
biomass, largely for heating and cooking in remote 
areas. In addition, there is significant potential for 
generating energy from household biodegradable 
waste, and the Baku Waste-to-Energy Plant (Box 4) 
demonstrates ongoing government efforts to realise 
this potential.

Box 4: Baku Waste-to-Energy Plant
The construction of this plant is based on the 
framework of “The Comprehensive Action Plan 
about the improvement of ecological situation in 
the Republic of Azerbaijan for the years 2006–
2010”. It was constructed based on a design–
build–operate arrangement with CNIM S.A., a 
French industrial engineering contractor and 
equipment manufacturer.
The total cost of design–build works for the plant 
is estimated at EUR 346 million. The plant design is 
based on 20 - year operation and 500 000 tonnes 
of municipal waste per year. The plant is located 
in the Balakhani settlement and features two 
incineration lines, each with a capacity of 250 000 
tonnes and a power generation capacity of 
231.5 GWh per year.
Plant construction was enabled by a Decree of the 
President of the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2008, 
which allocated responsibility for the collection 
and transportation of any solid household waste, 
regardless of its origin of generation, to Baku 
municipality. It was inaugurated in 2012 and 
complies with local and European environmental 
protection standards.3.3. Renewable energy related laws 
 under preparation
In accordance with Presidential Decree No. 1209 of 
29 May 2019 “On the acceleration of the reforms in 
the energy sector of the Republic of Azerbaijan”, the 
development of the draft law on “Use of renewable 
energy sources in power generation” was initiated. 
The draft law defines the main principles of state policy 
relating to renewable energy power generation. It has 
been developed with the support of the Norwegian 
company DNV GL. The draft law provides for additional 
concessions on tax and duties, feed-in-tariffs, off-taker 
obligations and other support mechanisms, such as for 
foreign direct investment and scientific research. 
• The draft law on “Efficient use of energy resources 
and energy efficiency” was prepared with technical 
assistance from the Energy Charter Secretariat, under 
the EU4Energy4 programme and was submitted to 
the Ministry of Energy in 2018. The draft law has 
subsequently been presented to the Cabinet of 
Ministers for review after co-ordination with related 
state agencies. 
Also with assistance from the EU, drafting of a standard 
PPA for renewable energy was initiated in late 2018. 
3.4. Economics of renewable energy
The state budget is the main financing source for 
the development of renewable energy in Azerbaijan. 
According to SAARES, between 2005 and 2015, 
AZN 987.4 million was invested in selected energy 
sources, including solar PV and heat pumps, wind, 
small hydro, biomass and waste (see Figure 7), of 
which AZN 820 million – or 83% – were from public 
investments. 
The current investment climate is not favourable 
to energy efficiency and renewable energy lending 
because of high interest rates. The interest rate of the 
Central Bank of Azerbaijan spiked in 2016 from below 
4% at the beginning of the year to more than 14% by the 
end of the same year. In October 2018, the Central Bank 
lowered the upper limit of its interest rate cap to 11.75%.
A number of international organisations are active in 
Azerbaijan, given its importance to regional and global 
energy markets. Partners actively pursuing projects 
in the country include the Asian Development Bank 
(ADB), the International Energy Charter, the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the 
European Union (EU) and the United States Agency 
for International Development (USAID). However, 
development partners have so far contributed to the 
renewable energy sector mostly through technical 
assistance, with limited direct investments in renewable 
energy projects.

 capacity
SAARES is taking steps to create the basis for skills 
and expertise development. As part of these efforts, 
students of several higher education institutions in 
Azerbaijan – such as the Azerbaijan State University of 
Oil and Industry, and the Azerbaijan State University of 
Architecture and Construction – have the opportunity 
to conduct field studies at Azalternativenergy LLC,
5
 the 
Gobustan Experimental Polygon and Training Centre 
(see Box 5) and associated solar installations.
A renewable energy engineering training and research 
centre has been created within the Baku Higher Oil 
School. The main purpose of this centre is to develop 
recommendations for the efficient use of renewable 
energy, train qualified renewable energy specialists and 
participate in the dissemination of knowledge in this 
field.
Box 5: Gobustan Experimental Polygon
 and Training Centre 
The Gobustan Experimental Polygon and 
Training Centre (GELTC) owns and operates the 
first hybrid-type renewable energy power plant 
built in Azerbaijan that includes wind, solar 
and biogas. The facility has three wind turbines 
(each 0.9 MW), a 3 MW solar power plant 
and a 1 MW biogas power plant. The complex 
integrates a regulation and control facility, a 
water reservoir, a testing area (polygon), a 
laboratory and a training centre as a showcase 
and capability-building hub for renewable 
energy in Azerbaijan. 
The complex was built in 2011 to contribute to 
the energy supply for Gobustan city (Phase 1) 
and the wider Gobustan region (Phase 2). 
While Phase 1 has been commissioned and 
is in operation, additional power generation 
capacities will be required for Phase 2. Hence, 
the Gobustan facility combines a pilot and 
showcase facility with training and offers 
practical experience in the development and 
operation of renewable energy technologies.

 RECOMMENDATIONS
This section presents a set of short- to medium-term recommendations to 
address key challenges and support the development of the renewable energy 
market in Azerbaijan. These recommended actions focus on providing a solid 
basis for creating a more conducive investment environment for renewable 
energy. At the same time, the government is already making progress towards 
the realisation of these actions. 
4.1. Legal and regulatory framework
The existing legal and regulatory framework for energy in Azerbaijan is 
covered by several laws on energy, electricity, heating and the use of energy 
resources that also include specific provisions for the use of renewable 
energy. There are several secondary legislations regulating specific aspects of 
electricity generation from renewable energy, such as investment protection, 
environmental protection and taxation. 
However, the country does not have a dedicated, comprehensive law 
governing the various aspects of renewable energy development. This 
creates challenges for market entrants when navigating legal and regulatory 
requirements, resulting in delays in the development of new projects and 
increased perception of risk among investors. A complex and ambiguous 
permitting procedure further hinders the development of renewable energy. 
Action 1: Adopt a renewable energy law
A dedicated law could provide overall direction to the renewable energy 
sector in Azerbaijan and significantly contribute to the development of 
a local market for renewables. Such a law would serve as an important 
reference point for renewable energy market players by providing a clear 
and reliable long-term perspective. 
The law should ideally cover all key elements of a sound legal and regulatory 
framework for renewable energy, starting with the definition and types 
of sources and technologies based on the existing technical potential in 
Azerbaijan. It could also outline elements related to government support 
mechanisms and principles of grid management relating to renewable 
energy. Furthermore, the law could provide the grounds to specify and 
simplify procedures for private sector investments, especially with respect 
to permitting.
Effective enforcement of a renewable energy law requires an appropriate 
institutional framework and administrative capacity, such as an independent 
regulator with responsibility for the oversight of contract enforcement. Thus, 
the law could also allocate roles and responsibilities to relevant government 
entities. 
Current status: In accordance with Presidential Decree No. 1209 of 29 May 
2019, “On the acceleration of the reforms in the energy sector of the Republic 
of Azerbaijan”, the development of the draft law on “Use of renewable 
energy sources in power generation” has been initiatedAt the time of Action 2: Streamlining the permitting
 procedure for renewable energy
Permitting requirements and procedures could be 
streamlined under a renewable energy law to provide 
a clear source of reference, as well as future direction 
should any amendments be applied. The overarching 
principles for the design of permitting procedures are 
simplicity, transparency and the flexibility to adapt to 
regulatory and market changes.
As a starting point, land plots for renewable energy 
project development could be allocated in zones with 
accessible connectivity to basic infrastructure, such 
as the electricity grid, water and roads. Furthermore, 
the establishment of a ‘one-stop-shop’ system for 
renewable energy projects could be considered to 
simplify and streamline the permitting process and 
facilitate better co-ordination of internal administrative 
processes and permitting requirements. Such a system 
should have the necessary decision-making powers 
to facilitate the different steps of the process that will 
allow the acquisition of permits. 
Publishing procedures for obtaining permits online, 
with information on the steps required – including the 
necessary documentation, expected timelines and the 
responsible government institutions – would provide 
more transparency to developers and investors. 
Current Status: Renewable energy project developers 
require permission for power plant construction, 
land use and power generation, in accordance with 
internationally accepted standards. 
4.2. Policy support mechanisms 
Low energy tariffs, especially due to fossil fuel subsidies, 
constitute one of the main barriers to the development 
of renewable energy in Azerbaijan. Pricing fossil 
fuels below international market prices hinders the 
deployment of renewable energy in power generation 
as well as in end-use sectors such as heating, cooling 
and transport. Renewable energy tariffs in Azerbaijan 
currently range between 2.94 and 3.35 US cents. 
Combined with the overall complexity of current policy 
frameworks, these tariff levels do not justify favourable 
decisions on project development from domestic or 
international investors.
Tariff regulations are currently not adapted to reflect 
the specific case of renewable energy, which has a 
different cost structure in terms of high initial capital 
expenditures (CAPEX) and relatively low operating 
expenditures (OPEX).
Therefore, the methodology for setting energy (and 
renewable energy) tariffs in Azerbaijan, both power 
and non-power, has been suboptimal for supporting 
renewable energy market development. 
The current methodology, which is applied to all 
government services, requires economic justification 
for the expenses recovered; however, renewable 
energy requires a differentiated approach to address 
the nascent nature of the sector in Azerbaijan and the 
inherent issue of high upfront investment and lower 
operational costs. One instrument that could serve 
as an effective price discovery mechanism is auction; 
however, this would need to be designed in a way that 
attracts investors and incites competition while also 
ensuring that projects are delivered.
Action 3: Enhance the procurement
 of renewable energy 
There is a need to identify support mechanisms that 
would facilitate the transition towards a functioning 
renewable energy market. Feed-in tariffs are critical to 
support the initial development of a national renewable 
energy market. However, as the market matures 
further, the use of auctions could offer the possibility 
of procuring renewable energy at lower prices through 
market-based price discovery. There are a number of 
prerequisites for this approach to be applied, including 
stable policy and regulatory frameworks and a high 
degree of competition in the market. 
A holistic approach to the design of key support 
mechanisms for renewable energy, encompassing both 
power and non-power sectors, would be beneficial for 
the development of renewables in Azerbaijan. IRENA’s 
report, Renewable energy auctions: A guide to design, 
provides a comprehensive overview of design options 
for countries considering auctions (IRENA 2015b).
Current Status: Azerbaijan is working towards 
conducting renewable energy auctions. In this regard, 
the Ministry of Energy is undertaking steps, including 
on-the-ground measurements, to define and prioritise 
zones with high renewable energy resource intensity. 
Eight zones (five wind and three solar) with total 
capacity of 750 MW have been already identified. 
Preliminary assessments on ownership and designation 
of lands, potential environmental impacts, and existing 
infrastructure have been conducted in these areas. The 
project “Assistance in designing and implementing 
renewable energy auctions in Azerbaijan”, is being 
implemented with the support of the European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). 4.3. Renewable energy financing
Underlying market barriers and perceived high risks 
constrain the financing of renewable energy projects 
in Azerbaijan. Dedicated credit lines for energy 
efficiency and renewable energy investment are limited 
and market absorption is low. Potential projects are 
hampered by the lack of primary and secondary 
legislation as well as the lack of awareness concerning 
the benefits of renewable energy. 
While measures have been recently implemented to 
align its banking sector regulations with international 
norms, renewable energy projects continue to face 
challenges in terms of access to capital in Azerbaijan 
due to lack of liquidity in the local banking system and 
high interest rates – which can be as high as 30% per 
annum on local currency. Collateral requirements from 
local banks are demanding and make local financing 
very costly compared to more developed renewable 
energy markets. 
Another critical element in attracting private investors 
into the sector through increased bankability of 
renewable energy projects is the power purchase 
agreement (PPA), which is an important contract that 
governs the sale and purchase of power and provides 
long-term clarity on roles, responsibilities, costs, 
revenues and associated risks. However, Azerbaijan 
does not have a standard PPA for renewable energy, 
which increases the perceived risk among renewable 
energy developers and investors. 
Action 4: Establish a dedicated financing 
 mechanism to address off-taker risk
Azerbaijan could benefit from creating facilitation 
mechanisms for the financing of renewable energy 
projects that will enable development of the renewable 
energy market, especially in its initial phases. Dedicated 
financing facilities for renewable energy projects could 
alleviate some of the difficulties and enhance the 
country’s attractiveness for international and local 
project developers and investors.
With a view to de-risking renewable energy projects, 
a dedicated financing mechanism overseen by a credit 
worthy institution could facilitate access to cheaper 
capital. One option is to create a dedicated fund to 
support renewable energy projects, which could be 
capitalised through a levy on conventional energy 
sources and disbursed through a robust off-taker 
arrangement. 
Given the lack of interest from local banks in financing 
renewable energy projects, the government of 
Azerbaijan could also consider creating a risk mitigation 
facility to encourage investment. Such a facility could 
provide guarantees for viable projects and collaborate 
with local banks to help build their knowledge and 
capacity on renewable energy project financing. 
Another option could be the provision of aggregated 
support for smaller projects to help the renewable 
energy market to take-off. Aggregating smaller 
projects allows for the streamlining of the due diligence 
process and access to larger pools of investment for 
local projects. For more insights, see IRENA’s report, 
Unlocking renewable energy nvestment: The role of risk 
mitigation and structured finance (IRENA 2016b).
Current status: The draft law on “Use of renewable 
energy sources in power generation” includes the 
application of guaranteed tariffs, active consumer 
support and other promotional mechanisms. Currently, 
in addition to the existing investment promotion 
mechanism, the Ministry of Energy has submitted 
proposals to the government regarding additional 
concessions on tax and customs. 
Action 5: Adopt a standard power purchasing 
 agreement (PPA)
Drafting and publishing a standard PPA for renewable 
projects will help to reduce perceived risk within 
the private sector and improve transparency and 
predictability in Azerbaijan’s renewable energy market. 
Robust PPAs can improve the economics of renewable 
energy projects, while suboptimal PPAs, on the other 
hand, may increase the costs of procurement. 
While the inherent features of PPAs vary depending on 
the specific country, there are some standard elements 
that a robust PPA can include to provide assurances to 
developers and investors, including the following: 
• Price in currency value per kWh of electricity produced, 
with a price adjustment mechanism to account for 
inflation and currency risk. 
• Tenure, based on number of years (preferably in the 
range of 20 years). 
• Supply commitment, which can depend on the type 
of technology and may vary from annual to daily, 
improving predictability for both parties.
• Additional elements such as coverage of policy/
regulatory risks, dispute settlement and ownership 
provisions will further increase transparency and 
increase the attractiveness of Azerbaijan to developers 
and investors.For more details on key clauses in PPAs, refer to the 
IRENA Project Navigator.6
 In addition, IRENA, jointly 
with the Terrawatt Initiative (TWI), launched the Open 
Solar Contracts initiative to provide standardised, opensource legal documentation solutions to simplify and 
streamline contractual processes and facilitate solar 
power project development.
Current status: The Ministry of Energy, in collaboration 
with an international consulting firm, has developed 
a draft standard PPA that considers best practices 
and reflects close consultation with stakeholders. 
Negotiations with private sector companies are 
underway to start implementing pilot projects through 
the PPA.
4.4. Long-term energy planning
Azerbaijan has a framework in place for planning 
its long-term overall energy sector development; 
however, existing planning processes could be updated 
to reflect the needs of the nascent renewable energy 
sector. Energy planning covers several aspects, often 
starting with the development of a national vision 
and long-term targets for the energy sector within a 
wider regional and global context. Integrating longterm planning with Azerbaijan’s overall energy sector 
strategy could stimulate the country’s renewable energy 
market development and improve its attractiveness to 
investors. 
Action 6: Develop long-term energy scenarios 
To identify the optimal energy mix and inform policy 
decisions accordingly, a detailed long-term planning 
exercise could be undertaken for energy demand in the 
electricity, industry, residential, commercial, agriculture 
and transport sectors. In order to fully assess the 
potential for electrification, energy efficiency and 
renewable energy penetration, Azerbaijan’s energy 
planning requires a deeper focus on non-power sectors, 
such as heating and cooling, and transport.
Such analyses will assess the costs and benefits of 
different renewable energy technologies (solar, wind, 
bioenergy, etc.), including their potential for penetration 
and optimal scale of deployment. To this end, an 
assessment of technical and economic renewable 
energy potential by technology is required to outline 
future scenarios with increased shares of renewable 
energy. There is also a need to comprehensively assess 
current energy infrastructure, focusing on aspects 
such as the country’s power grid and the investments 
needed for grid upgrades.
The development of long-term energy scenarios 
could help address the issue of integrating variable 
renewables into the power grid in the medium - to 
long-term, thereby allaying the technical concerns 
of generators, grid operators and distributors. More 
insights are included in IRENA’s report, Planning for 
the renewable future: Long-term modelling and tools 
to expand variable renewable power in emerging 
economies (IRENA 2017).
Current status: As part of national power sector 
planning, the country has been carrying out 
assessments to account for energy demand growth, the 
supply network, scheduling and dispatch. In line with 
renewable energy development, efforts are underway 
to identify zones with high potential and assess the 
infrastructure needed to ensure smooth integration into 
the power system.
Action 7: Adopt a long-term renewable 
 energy target 
While Azerbaijan has already approved a renewable 
energy target for 2020, a robust target for the 2030 
horizon and possibly beyond could offer more longterm clarity for the private sector and investors as 
well as encourage the development of new projects. 
Targets enhance the transparency of the policy-making 
process by providing a common information base to all 
stakeholders, thereby fostering public support. 
When backed by supportive policy and investment 
frameworks, targets can be instrumental in indicating 
the envisioned trajectory of market growth, thereby 
helping to anchor medium and long-term expectations. 
By giving a sense of trajectory and growth, they can 
also contribute to lowering deployment costs and 
establishing a supply chain utilising local industry 
(see IRENA’s report, Renewable energy target setting, 
2015a).
Policies supporting renewable energy development 
adopted by countries around the world are mostly 
focused on the power sector, with relatively few 
countries providing support for renewables in end-use 
sectors. To realise the potential of renewables across 
sectors, targets need to be set across heating, cooling, 
transport and power. 
Current status: Beyond the 420 MW target for 
2020, the government is considering a longer-term 
target to increase the share of renewable energy in 
power generation up to 30% by 2030. To achieve 
these ambitious targets for 2020 and 2030, the 
implementation of auctions has been identified as the 
main priority.4.5. Grid regulation for renewable 
 energy
Grid codes set the rules and technical requirements for 
power system and energy market operation. They serve 
dual policy goals: on one hand, they provide assurances 
of reliability, quality and security of supply; while on the 
other, they create technical conditions for the gradual 
growth of variable renewable energy. Azerbaijan faces 
challenges related to technical regulation for the grid 
connection of renewable power generation units. There 
is currently no applicable grid code in place which 
defines the technical requirements for the integration 
of renewable energy and provides a reference point for 
renewable power generators. 
From the perspective of the grid operator in Azerbaijan, 
the variable nature of some renewable energy resources 
– such as wind and solar PV – creates a challenge for 
their integration into the grid, thereby slowing down the 
development of renewable energy. Rules for acquiring 
grid connections, grid codes, dispatch priorities and 
curtailment compensation are some of the critical 
issues that may affect early projects in the development 
of a national renewable energy programme. 
Action 8: Develop and implement a grid 
 connection code with standards for
 variable renewable energy integration
The Government of Azerbaijan could provide a mandate 
to relevant organisations to develop a grid connection 
code for VRE in consultation with all relevant actors. The 
function of a grid connection code including variable 
renewable energy is to provide technical requirements 
for wind and PV plants when connecting to a country’s 
electricity grid. This helps in ensuring the quality and 
standardisation of equipment, and the fair treatment of 
generators and operators concerning grid connection, 
while also maintaining system stability and reliability. 
The establishment of a country-wide grid code could 
improve overall grid management, creating positive 
effects on the development of renewable energy by 
reducing the perceived technical risks for investors and 
developers. This may also facilitate regional integration 
and enhance electricity exports, which is relevant 
for Azerbaijan, given its overcapacity of electricity 
generation.
The process of developing a national variable renewable 
energy grid code includes number of elements, such as 
preparation of technical studies, data collection and 
assessment of country-specific aspects, as elaborated 
in IRENA’s report, Scaling-up variable renewable power: 
The role of grid codes (IRENA 2016a). 
Current status: The Ministry of Energy, with the support 
of EBRD and the involvement of a consulting firm, has 
implemented a project, “Strengthening the grid to 
support renewable energy projects in Azerbaijan”, to 
identify potential of renewable energy resources and 
opportunities for integrating them into the grid.

 raising awareness
While Azerbaijan has made initial inroads into 
developing local capabilities in renewable energy, the 
scale of planned renewable energy development (in line 
with the 2020 target and beyond) requires a broad and 
deep understanding of the full life cycle of renewable 
energy projects and the associated knowledge and 
skill requirements. In Azerbaijan, there is a limited 
existing skill base in the areas of renewable energy 
policy making, technologies, and technical and project 
development. Moreover, the wider public is not fully 
aware of the range of benefits offered by renewable 
energy. 
Given the targets set by the government for renewable 
energy uptake, substantive efforts are needed to build 
capacity and develop skills among employees of the 
central government and local institutions (e.g. financial 
entities). Raising awareness of policy and regulatory 
fundamentals for renewable energy and its benefits in 
terms of economic and social development in Azerbaijan 
is an important element in scaling up renewables.
Private sector stakeholders interested in entering the 
renewable energy market could benefit from capacity 
building relating to the latest technology developments 
and future trends, as well as business models and case 
studies from abroad. Azerbaijan’s existing training 
facilities, such as the Gobustan Experimental Polygon 
and Training Centre, could be leveraged for this
purpose. Institutes of higher learning may also be
encouraged to offer courses on topics related to
renewable energy.
Action 9: Raise awareness and develop
 a capacity–building strategy
The government could plan a long-term programme of 
activities to increase general awareness and capacity 
on renewable energy, targeting state institutions, local 
enterprises and citizens. Such a programme could also 
integrate certifications in training curricula, with a focus 
on building local operation and maintenance skills to 
enhance employment opportunities. 
Government institutions could benefit from specialised 
capacity building on renewable energy policy and 
regulation, and evaluation techniques for renewable 
energy projects. For the private sector, courses could 
be offered explaining opportunities for setting up 
renewable energy enterprises, including information on 
available government support schemes and partners. 
Additionally, certification and training on various 
renewable energy applications and related technologies 
for both power and non-power uses could be useful.
Greater awareness of the benefits of renewable energy 
and how these apply to the overall economic situation 
in Azerbaijan could be helpful among the wider public.
An awareness campaign could be organised through 
a series of information activities, especially in regions 
with high potential for renewable energy development. 
In addition, various other formats could be designed to 
raise awareness, such as campaigns on social media, 
competitions and challenges for students in schools, 
higher institutes of learning and universities, as well as 
local events in selected towns and cities.
Current status: The Ministry of Energy and the SAARES 
implement activities on an annual basis to raise public 
awareness about the use of renewable energy and the 
production of carbon-free electricity. Furthermore, the 
Ministry of Energy is strengthening its co-operation on 
renewables with international private companies and 
partners to promote investments. The growing number 
of signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) 
between the Ministry of Energy and foreign partners is 
a clear indication of the strong interest in developing 
renewables in Azerbaijan. Throughout 2018 and 2019, 
a series of consultative events was held on the theme 
“Public-private partnership in the development of 
renewable energy legislation”, with the objective 
of obtaining feedback from stakeholders, including 
international companies, financial institutions and local 
stakeholders, on the proposed legislation process.
Efforts are needed 
to build capacity and 
develop skills among 
government employeesREFERENCES
