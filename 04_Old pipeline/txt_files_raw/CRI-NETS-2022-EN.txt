SUMMARY
As with other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Costa Rica is highly vulnerable to 
the effects of climate change, even though it contributed less than 0.05% of global greenhouse 
gas emissions in 2019. The country has developed national vision of transforming its economy 
to net zero emissions by 2050 and an ambitious decarbonisation plan with sectoral breakdowns including for the transport and buildings sectors. To meet Costa Rica’s decarbonisation 
target, there is a need for the national government as well as local municipalities to step up their 
actions. This is because that scaling up the use of clean energy and improving energy efficiency 
at both the national and local levels are key in realising the shared decarbonisation objective. 
This would particularly require support from local governments in implementation when it 
involves urban planning interplaying with energy use at the local levels. Over the past years, 
municipalities have been undertaking efforts to improve the sustainability of their jurisdictions, 
to which decarbonisation actions are well in aligned with this endeavor. 
Despite that Costa Rica’s central government is in charge of developing national energy and 
transport policies and regulations, there is large technical potential for decarbonisation in cities, 
given that 75% of the country’s population lives in urban areas. This report explores plausible 
technological options in the Greater Metropolitan Area of the Central Valley of Costa Rica to 
contribute towards achieving the national decarbonisation goal. 
IRENA’s urban planning tool was implemented to assess technological pathways that enable 
the decarbonisation of cities. The analysis focused on cities within the Greater Metropolitan 
Area of Costa Rica, analysing in detail five representative districts. Two technological pathways 
– considering the existing policy measures in the country – were evaluated for each district, and 
the respective results were compared against a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario in which no 
climate or energy-related policies are in place. 
The first pathway, the National Decarbonisation Plan (NDP) scenario, scales the targets set in the 
country’s National Decarbonisation Plan down to the city level, achieving a significant reduction 
in emissions while increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources and the electrification 
of economic activities in the transport, industry, residential and commercial sectors. The second 
pathway, the net zero carbon (NZC) scenario, reaches the maximum level of decarbonisation by 
electrifying all activities to reach a full reduction of carbon emissions in the energy and transport 
sectors by mid-century – an ambitious target that is useful for exploring benefits and costs.The analysis shows that reducing emissions in cities by around 90% by 2050 compared to 
BAU is technically possible in the NDP scenario. Crucially, the results demonstrate that it is still 
possible to reach a 100% emission reduction in this same period in the NZC scenario. In other 
words, there are no technological barriers to meeting high-ambition targets by 2050.
Decarbonising cities not only brings reductions in emissions but also results in savings of energy 
costs to cities and their inhabitants. These savings are related primarily to lower operational 
costs linked to renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency improvements. To meet 
the NZC scenario, a mix of technologies needs to be deployed, including: solar photovoltaic (PV) 
systems, energy storage systems, air-source heat pumps, and electro-mobility for private, public 
and freight fleets. The results suggest that this scenario requires higher total costs, including 
for integrating these technologies, along with grid infrastructure upgrades necessitated by 
increased electricity demand from electric vehicles. 
Results extrapolated to the concession area of the state power utility CNFL highlight that the 
overall costs for cities in all scenarios are similar. While the decarbonisation of most cities will 
bring energy cost savings of up to 18% compared to the BAU scenario by 2050, cities with 
low population density, large geographic area and low solar PV production may experience 
relatively higher costs. More importantly, the analysis shows that investments in the NDP and 
NZC scenarios are mainly in zero-emission technologies, thereby reducing emissions and leading 
to co-benefits associated with health. The adoption of public transport promoted in these two 
decarbonisation scenarios also brings co-benefits from reduced congestion and accidents.
This study recommends key actions needed in cities to enable the transformational change 
towards decarbonisation. City energy-related goals should focus on reducing carbon emissions 
(particularly from transport), improving energy efficiency across sectors, increasing renewable 
energy integration, and increasing cycling and walking as alternative mobility options. To enable 
this transformation, however, decision makers will have to consider in their urban planning 
the need to overcome key challenges, including institutional barriers, technical aspects, fiscal 
concerns, tariffs, employment and uncertainty. Among other measures, cities in Costa Rica can 
adopt good practices, enforcement of standards, long-term vision, the use of advanced planning 
tools, involvement in national planning, and circular economy activities to maximise the benefits 
of decarbonising their energy and transport sectors.1

To address the global climate challenge, Costa Rica has committed to fully decarbonising its 
economy by 2050 and has developed a corresponding plan to achieve this target (UNFCCC, 2019; 
UNFCCC, 2018). As in many countries, implementing such a comprehensive plan would require 
efforts at all levels. Although Costa Rica’s central government is in charge of developing national 
energy and transport policies and regulations (Presidencia de La República, 2019), there is large 
potential for decarbonisation in cities, given that 75% of the country’s population lives in urban 
areas. This report explores plausible technological options in the Greater Metropolitan Area of the 
Central Valley of Costa Rica to contribute towards achieving the national decarbonisation goal. 
1.1 National context
Costa Rica has a population of around 5 million inhabitants within a total area of 51060 square 
kilometres (km2), making it the third densest country in the Central America region (following 
El Salvador and Guatemala) with 98 inhabitants per km2. The territory is structured in 7 provinces, 
82 cantons (municipalities) and 482 districts (Figure 1). The rapidly growing Greater Metropolitan 
Area, which includes the capital, San José, and the provinces of Alajuela, Heredia and Cartago, is 
home to 2.2 million inhabitants, nearly half of the population, distributed within an area of 2044 km2.

ALAJUELAEconomic growth in Costa Rica has depended heavily on the services and industry sectors 
(Figure 2), which have largely driven the more than 30% increase in the country’s gross domestic 
product (GDP) between 2012 and 2019 (Central Bank of Costa Rica, 2020a; IMF, 2020). The 
economy has been fuelled primarily by clean electricity generated from renewable energy 
sources such as hydropower, geothermal and wind energy, and by petroleum-based fuels used 
mainly for transport and industry (Figures 3).
As shown in Figure 3(c), the transport sector is the largest consumer of oil, at 83% in 2018, 
followed distantly by the industry (12%) and residential (3%) sectors. Consumption of 
petroleum-based transport fuels has increased over the last 13 years alongside the growth in 
internal combustion engine vehicles, assuming similar driving behaviours and fuel economy 
since 2007 (Figure 4) (SEPSE and MINAE, 2018).

(2018)Among the nine power suppliers, the state-run ICE (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, or 
Costa Rican Institute of Electricity) accounts for the bulk of the electricity supply. It provides 
63.7% of the total installed generation capacity of 3 500 megawatts (MW) and also monopolises 
the national transmission market (Figure 5). Two municipally owned energy utilities, ESPH and 
JASEC, operate only 3% of the national total generation capacity, while co-operatives account 
for around 5.9%. 
Meanwhile, privately owned energy companies account for 24% of the capacity, with a breakdown 
of 11.10% (Law No. 7200 Cap 1) and BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) 12.96% (Law No. 7200 Cap 2), 
which is below the 15% cap capacity stipulated by law. Generation companies cannot engage 
in the direct sale of electricity. However, private co-operatives can sell the electricity that they 
generate to one another (Law No. 8345, art. 9) and to the transmission grid operator (ICE), 
which is one of four concessionary energy providers at the distribution level.

Municipal companies (2)1.2 National Decarbonisation Plan and the role of cities
Even though Costa Rica contributed less than 0.05% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 
2019, like other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean it is highly vulnerable to the 
effects of climate change. Consequently, different policy actions have been implemented over 
the past decade to reinforce the country’s engagement with global targets. These actions and 
intentions are manifested in Costa Rica’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) towards 
reducing emissions under the Paris Agreement, which calls for a 44% reduction in the country’s 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and represents one of the most ambitious targets in the 
region (CEPAL, 2018). 
Cities in Costa Rica are directly involved in climate change mitigation through the Cantonal 
Country Programme, driving change and assuming multiple roles including decision making, 
planning, managing assets and operating local energy suppliers, among others. In this context, 
municipalities are also key actors in the transition towards 2050, in which new energy technologies 
in the transport, industry and residential sectors will be deployed under the guidance of the 
national government. 
In 2019, Costa Rica launched a National Decarbonisation Plan (NDP) as an action to combat 
climate change (Government of Costa Rica and MINAE, 2019a; UNFCCC et al., 2020). The NDP 
presents a decarbonisation pathway towards net zero emissions by 2050. It includes seven 
lines of action focused specifically on the contribution from cities, as summarised below and 
illustrated in Figure 6. Implementing the NDP therefore requires collective efforts involving all 
relevant stakeholders.

1.3 Methodology and approach
This report aims to improve understanding of the decarbonisation pathways for municipalities 
in Costa Rica, with a focus on five representative districts located within the concession area of 
the state-owned power utility CNFL (Compañía Nacional de Fuerza y Luz, or National Company 
of Power and Light). 
The collected data were embedded in a geographic information system (GIS) database that 
details the features needed to characterise the districts from an energy planning perspective. 
In-depth analyses were then executed for these districts, and the respective results were 
extrapolated to the utility scale, with the aim of supporting decision makers at the local and 
national levels. For data that were not accessible, advanced data mining techniques were 
employed to identify typical districts based on demographic, socio-economic and energyrelated data collected at the national, municipal, district and household levels (see the 
next section). 
The overall methodology for the analysis is shown in Figure 7. The approach comprises a 
combination of data mining and optimisation techniques to generate data-driven knowledge to 
better estimate the potential for integrating renewable energy in the urban context of Costa Rica. 
These techniques include:
• Data collection: An exhaustive data collection process at the district or municipal scale 
was executed to implement an advanced classification process facilitating quantification of 
the potential for renewable energy integration by district, based on the main drivers and • GIS-embedded database: Based on the data collected, a GIS-embedded database was 
produced to support districts/municipalities in deploying detailed urban energy planning 
based on local geospatial constraints and renewable energy integration potential.
• Clustering and identification of representative districts: A clustering technique was then 
applied to identify five representative districts that are used to study the decarbonisation 
process of cities. District-level results were extrapolated to the power utility’s concession 
area to provide insights for planning the electricity infrastructure.
• District-level database: The database produced was adjusted to each of the five 
representative districts. Each district was characterised by its GDP, population growth and 
energy consumption by type of customer (residential, industrial, commercial, transport, etc.). 
Energy consumption was disaggregated into end uses to study the different technologies 
available for decarbonisation of the district. Information related to renewable energy 
technologies (e.g. rooftop solar PV, horizontal wind turbines) and energy storage systems 
(e.g. batteries, hydrogen) was identified to produce a database of low-carbon technologies 
that can contribute to decarbonising the energy sectors of these districts.
• Urban planning scenarios: Three scenarios were produced, and the benefits and costs of 
each scenario were compared to understand the potential of renewable energy in each 
district: 
– BAU scenario: This is the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario that exists in the absence

– NDP scenario: This scenario scales the actions of the National Decarbonisation Plan (NDP) 
down to cities by promoting efficiency, a switch to renewable energy technologies and 
the electrification of energy end uses.
– NZC scenario: This scenario aims at net zero carbon emissions by 2050 by enforcing 
the actions mentioned for the NDP scenario. Costa Rica’s current Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) is already compatible with this scenario. 
• Optimisations and simulations using IRENA’s Planning Platform for Urban Renewable 
Energy: The planning tool developed by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) 
was applied within each representative district, considering the database and locally available 
technologies to estimate the costs and environmental impacts of each scenario.
The tool aims to support the decision-making process for long-term urban energy planning in 
cities by analysing and optimising the technical and financial viability of integrating renewable 
energy technologies. Considering the renewable energy resource potential and combining 
spatial analysis and energy systems modelling across different sectors, the tool compares 
different solutions with the objective of minimising carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the 
energy sector and buildings, as well as the total energy system costs. The main features of the 
tool are illustrated in Figure 8.

CONTEXT AND 
REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICTS 
OF THE GREATER 
METROPOLITAN AREA
2.1 Characterisation of districts in the Greater Metropolitan Area
The state-owned power company CNFL supplies electricity in most districts of the Greater 
Metropolitan Area, as shown in light blue in Figure 9. To characterise these districts in the 
analysis, multiple sources of information were collected, combined and represented in GIS 
FIGURE 9: Map of CNFL coverage (in light blue) showing districts of Costa Rica (left) 
and the zoomed-in coverage area provided by MIVAH for the study (right)
Note: The five districts analysed in detail in the report are highlighted in yellow on the MIVAH1 map (right).
Disclaimer: Boundaries and names shown on this map do not imply any endorsement or acceptance by IRENA.format. The resulting database comprises key features including the surface area, population 
density, economic growth, energy consumption, and number and type of customer (residential, 
commercial or industrial), among others. For example, high-resolution data were gathered on 
monthly energy consumption for each building within the districts and were used to produce 
time-series demand profiles. In addition, the end uses for each technological carrier at a building 
level were identified based on energy surveys.
2.2 Local renewable energy options
Costa Rica is known for its vast natural resources, which greatly increase the country’s potential 
for deploying renewable energy technologies. This study specifically explores the potential of 
solar and wind energy resources in districts, with the greatest values found in the northwest 
(Figure 10).
In terms of technology applications in the built environment, solar PV systems have increasingly 
gained attention due largely to two attributes: 1) the installations can be modular, while the 
system efficiency is not impacted significantly by the scale of installed capacity; and 2) the 
levelised cost of electricity at the utility scale has declined substantially in the past decade and is 
expected to continue to drop in the coming years, making solar PV generation cost-competitive 
with fossil fuel-based power generation in a growing number of regions and contexts including 
urban settings (IRENA, 2021b; IRENA, 2020a). 
Wind turbines, unlike solar PV, are currently less applicable within urban areas and are increasingly 
seen in the surrounding areas of cities as part of distributed energy generation located close 
to the load. Although urban wind turbine technologies have been progressing, they are still 
relatively rare despite pilot projects. 
FIGURE 10: Average monthly renewable energy potential per square metre by district 
in 2018 for (a) solar energy and (b) wind energy at 10 metres above surface levelBiomass resources such as sugar cane, coffee, pineapple and oil palm, as well as biomass from 
animal farms and municipal waste, also offer an opportunity for local renewables, provided that 
the radius of collection is cost-effective economically. On most occasions, biomass-based energy 
applications bring multiple benefits including social, economic and environmental benefits for 
local residents.
The analysis considers a suite of technologies that can contribute to the decarbonisation 
of districts (Figure 11). To assess the role of storage technologies within Costa Rica’s urban 
context, flow redox batteries and hydrogen were included in the technology database, along 
with lithium-ion batteries. Fuel cell and electrolyser technologies have significant potential as 
the government has supported their further exploration, in addition to the ongoing effort to 
produce hydrogen using the country’s existing renewable sources.
Table 1 provides an overview of key technologies facilitating the integration of renewable energy 
included in the scenarios.
The energy network plays a critical role in accommodating local renewables. At present, utility 
companies supply electricity to the concession areas through a radial distribution network. 
However, from a technical perspective, cities could also inject electricity from distributed 
energy generation into the power grid, making the transition from passive to active distribution 
networks (meshed distribution networks)2. To enable this, network reinforcements might be 
required to cope with the integration of renewable energy technologies.

To account for these upgrades, the analysis considered the costs of upgrading the current 
network and increasing its capacity to host more renewable energy technologies in the shift 
towards the decarbonisation of cities. Further analysis can be performed to assess factors such 
as contingency, voltage drop, and short-circuit fault or line outages, by exporting the results 
to network simulation tools for in-depth evaluation of the technical challenges and benefits of 2.3 Energy demand 
Time-series load profiles per customer within each district were computed to estimate their 
energy demand at an hourly basis for one year, as shown in Figure 12. Because Costa Rica is located 
in a tropical climate zone with an average year-round temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (°C), 
domestic space heating or cooling systems are not commonly found. However, districts located 
near the coast may require assessing cooling demand in the future. In the Greater Metropolitan 
Area, the use of cooling technologies is limited to commercial, industry and public buildings. 
The energy required for domestic hot water (or eventually cooling) is produced mostly using 
electricity-based systems. These end uses are represented in the electricity profiles.
This power utility database includes all the geo-referenced customers of the electricity company, 
classified by sector (residential, commercial or industrial) with the average monthly energy 
consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh). 
Demand profiles database
This database considers high-resolution measured data on the load profile (10 minutes) from 
1351 customers. These data have been cleaned of potential measurement errors or outages and 
then classified into weekday and weekend. The final classification of the load profiles is detailed 
in Table 2, based on the sectoral categories defined in Table 3.

Daily load profiles for each geo-referenced customer not included in the demand profiles 
database were generated using the procedure suggested in Leiva et al. (2017). In this procedure, 
the average monthly electricity consumption of each customer from the power utility database 
is classified according to its sector in Table 3, then daily profiles are generated with a Gaussian 
distribution fitted to the demand profiles database of the reference sector. The distribution of 
customers and electricity consumption is presented in Table 4.

Note: GWh = gigawatt-hours.2.4 Estimation of roof areas in buildings
To better quantify the potential area of rooftop available to install solar PV systems, the building 
area was included in the analysis. Although GIS databases were available for some municipalities, 
the data were insufficient to approximate the rooftop area of each building. Therefore, surveys 
at the national level undertaken by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INEC) were 
retrieved. According to the National Household Survey of 2019 (INEC, 2019), the floor area was 
reported for a portion of houses in every region of the country. 
With this information and data from the Central Region of the country (around 970000 
buildings), the average area of the residences was determined. Information published by INEC 
on the construction sector between 2015 and 2017 made it possible to estimate the area of 
buildings in the commercial and industrial sectors (INEC, 2018).
2.5 Creation of representative districts
By applying data-mining techniques and considering demographic and geographic characteristics 
along with energy use, customer type, and renewable energy potential, five districts were identified 
to represent the 109 districts of the CNFL concession area. The five districts are described briefly 
below, and Figure 13 characterises them according to their electricity needs.
• District 1 – Desamparados de Desamparados: This is the densest district in the country 
with more than 35 000 inhabitants, and also has a low Cantonal Human Development Index 
in Costa Rica. While the district’s energy consumption is not the highest in the Greater 
Metropolitan Area, it is expected to double by 2050 driven by economic growth, even if 
population growth has slowed. Of the nearly 12 000 electricity customers in this district, 88% 
are residential, 11% are commercial, and only 1% are industrial. The potential for deploying 
solar PV systems in the district at a building level has been investigated in previous works 
(Valverde et al., 2015), finding low penetration due mainly to the technology cost. However,

120the cost is constantly decreasing because of economies of scale, and incentives for solar PV 
deployment in the medium and long terms will likely be available to enhance adoption. Due 
to the district’s density and number of customers, it will likely face infrastructure planning 
challenges for technologies that require a large area for deployment.
• District 2 – San Vicente de Moravia: This district of 30 000 inhabitants has experienced 
rising energy needs in recent years, driven primarily by economic growth. Of the more than 
12500 electricity customers in the district, 88% are residential, 11.5% are commercial, and 
only 0.5% are industrial. The districts within the cluster represented by San Vicente have 
seen an increase in the Cantonal Human Development Index, positioning them at the top of 
the ranking. This suggests that economic conditions may not be a barrier for the adoption of 
new technologies, as is the case in Desamparados. This also explains why even if the district’s 
population growth has slowed, electricity consumption in San Vicente is expected to double 
by 2050. Due to rising urbanisation rates, the district is likely to face planning challenges on 
space availability for deploying some technologies. However, the installation of rooftop solar 
PV along with energy storage systems can be an attractive alternative.
• District 3 – San Pedro de Montes de Oca: With the same number of inhabitants as San Vicente, 
San Pedro has experienced growth in its energy needs driven mainly by commercial activities 
around the academic sector, as the district hosts many universities. This district is relatively 
dense, and its buildings are typically old. San Pedro has the highest electricity consumption 
among the five representative districts, with more than 13 000 electricity customers, of which 
80% are residential, 19.7% are commercial, and only 0.3% are industrial. Similar to San Vicente, 
population growth has slowed but electricity consumption is expected to double by 2050, in 
this case due to energy-intensive activities in the commercial sector. As the district’s Cantonal 
Human Development Index approaches the top of the ranking in the expectation of growing 
economic development, the adoption and deployment of new technologies seem feasible 
and worth exploring. 
• District 4 – San Isidro de Coronado: While other districts in Costa Rica face urban planning 
challenges related to their high population density and lack of available land space, San Isidro 
is notable for having around 18 000 inhabitants distributed over a relatively large area. Its 
energy needs have not changed significantly over the years; however, the need to electrify 
activities will likely lead to higher needs in the future. Of the 6 000 electricity customers in 
this district, 88.5% are residential, 11% are commercial, and only 0.5% are industrial. Although 
the district’s Cantonal Human Development Index has increased, it is not yet at the top of the 
ranking. Growing economic development, however, indicates that transformations can occur 
if well-designed policies are in place. The main challenge in this district is not so much land 
space for placing technologies, but the relatively low potential for solar PV production – the 
irradiance values are not as high as in other districts within the Greater Metropolitan Area, 
which may necessitate exploring other technologies.
• District 5 – San Rafael de Coronado: This district has the lowest number of inhabitants 
among the five representative districts, with only around 8 000, as well as the lowest 
electricity consumption. The district is dominated by farmers, and while the Cantonal 
Human Development Index remains low, it has increased over the years. Unlike in the other 
studied districts, the population is expected to grow by 2050, and along with economic 
development this is expected to increase energy consumption in the future. Of the 3 000 
electricity customers in this district, 87% are residential, 7.6% are commercial, and 5.4% are the land area is vast, allowing the deployment of technologies that may not be suitable for 
high-density districts (for example, wind turbines). According to existing studies (Valverde 
et al., 2015), solar PV generation may be unsuitable due primarily to cloud effects. The use 
of waste is another technology with great potential given the presence of many cattle 
factories in this district.

THE ENERGY SECTORS 
AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL
Given the high urbanisation rate in Costa Rica and that nearly half of the population resides 
within the boundaries of the Greater Metropolitan Area, it is necessary that municipalities be 
part of the country’s decarbonisation strategy – the strategy that has been orchestrated and 
designed at the national level while being implemented with the support and engagement from 
local authorities and stakeholders. For example, authorities at the local level can put forward 
initiatives such as planning a “15-minute” city (as proposed by Paris, France) to shift mobility 
to non-motorised transport. Such initiatives would lead to reduced consumption of fossil fuels, 
which currently dominate the transport fuel mix in Costa Rica. 
Other opportunities exist as well. Even though Costa Rica’s electricity demand is well covered 
under the current Electricity Generation Expansion Plan, strategically it is worth considering 
diversifying the mix to enhance energy security and hedge against the seasonable variation 
and climate-induced risks facing hydropower generation. From a technical perspective, local 
renewable energy sources, particularly solar PV and wind energy, can be tapped into to diversify 
the power mix, thus enhancing the security of energy supply (IRENA, 2021a). 
Renewables can bring numerous benefits to local governments, including improving the quality 
of life of citizens, contributing to climate mitigation, boosting the local economy and creating 
jobs, and improving the quality and reliability of the power supply. However, realising these 
benefits would require a thorough scenario-based evaluation of urban energy development 
options. This could provide an overall framework for different national authorities to better 
co-ordinate among themselves, as well as for local governments to utilise, particularly since 
urban planning needs to be involved. 
3.1 Medium- and long-term perspectives
Costa Rica’s existing national climate policies provided guidance to construct three scenarios, 
which are applicable to the five representative districts. The first scenario, business-as-usual 
(BAU), considers no decarbonisation targets and assumes that fossil fuels will continue to urban-level NDP, adopts the targets stated in the National Decarbonisation Plan, scaling them 
down to the district level using the population and GDP, with the objective of analysing the 
potential for decarbonisation following the NDP targets with the support of municipalities 
involved in urban energy planning. The third scenario, net zero carbon (NZC), considers the 
country’s vision to become carbon-neutral by 2050 in line with the NDP, which includes the 
highest penetration of renewable energy resources in the transport and energy sectors. 
Business-as-usual (BAU) scenario 
The BAU scenario does not consider energy policies towards decarbonisation. Fossil fuels 
continue to be the main source of energy in the country, particularly in the transport and 
industry sectors, and their consumption follows the existing trend. This scenario presents a 
path dependency future with low penetration of distributed generation and practically no 
deployment of electric vehicles. Key projections are presented below: 
• Energy sector: The renewable energy share increases from 27% in 2020 to only 30% in 
2050 considering a low penetration of renewables in the energy system. Low electrification 
in industry by 2050 to replace fossil fuels results in this very limited increase in the share of 
renewable energy.
• Residential sector: If new energy policies are not applied in the residential sector, there 
will be a small decrease in the renewable energy share due to a slight increase in the use of 
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking. Currently, this sector has an 82% renewable share 
(electricity), which could decrease 2% by 2050 due to increased use of LPG for cooking.
• Commercial and public buildings: The use of LPG for cooking increases here as well, and the 
sector’s current renewable energy share of 93% could drop to 91%.
• Industrial sector: Current electrification of the industry sector is 43%, and there would be a 
substitution of fossil fuels of up to 50% by 2050.
• Transport sector: The transport sector remains as it is today, with the vehicle fleet almost 
100% based on fossil fuels.
• Emission reduction: Emissions in 2018 were 6.73 megatonnes (Mt) of CO2-equivalent, and 
without decarbonisation they will grow an estimated 35% by 2050.
Urban-level National Decarbonisation Plan (NDP) scenario 
The urban-level NDP scenario considers a full deployment of the policy actions presented in 
the NDP, scaled down to the district level. It represents a high climate ambition for the country. 
This scenario shows the pathway towards electrification of the transport sector (public, private 
and freight) and a highly renewable electricity mix with a high penetration of distributed energy 
resources. It considers a gradual increase until 2050 of targets, as follows:
• Total renewable energy share increases to reach 95% of total final energy consumption by 
2050.• Renewable energy share in the residential sector increases to reach 100% of total final energy 
consumption in the sector by 2050.
• Renewable energy share in commercial and public buildings increases to reach 100% of total 
final energy consumption in the sector by 2050.
• Renewable energy share in industry increases to reach 80% of total final energy consumption 
in the sector by 2050.
• Renewable energy share in transport increases to reach 90% of total final energy consumption 
in the sector by 2050.
• CO2-equivalent emissions drop 85% by 2050 compared to 2018.
The use of electricity for transport is expected to grow significantly by 2050 in the urban-level 
NDP scenario, as evidenced by the fuel shares of energy demand at the national level in the 
transport sector (Figure 14). This scenario also considers the gradual replacement of diesel and 
petrol with electricity and hydrogen, and a limited penetration of LPG. The scenario also expects 
a reduction in energy demand due to the greater efficiency of the technologies that use these 
new fuels in the transport sector.
Decarbonisation of the transport sector is likely to contribute the greatest level of emission 
reductions and will potentially drive other socio-economic benefits in cities such as lower 
congestion, fewer accidents and more jobs (IDB and DDP-LAC, 2019; Saget, Vogt-Schilb and 
Luu, 2020). However, to enable the benefits of an electric transport sector, the electricity system 
must also evolve. It must ensure high participation of renewable energy sources with deployment 
of distributed generation in the overall energy system.

Energy (GWh)
Diesel Elec Gasoline Hydrogen LPG
BAU NDPElectrification of the industry sector must also evolve, and enabling conditions should be 
designed. Figure 15 indicates a growing share of electricity for this sector, which will help reduce 
overall energy consumption through increased energy efficiency. Petroleum coke, LPG, fuel oil 
and diesel used in the BAU scenario (without decarbonisation) are gradually decarbonised with 
low- or zero-emission technologies. 
However, to maximise the benefits of electrifying the industry sector, challenges remain. 
Electrification of this sector may lead to higher energy expenditure for the end users as a result of 
the lost subsidies granted to the substituted petroleum-derived energy commodities. Therefore, 
restructuring electricity tariffs to support this technological transition may be required. 
In Costa Rican industry, the main fuels that emit greenhouse gases are oil, petroleum coke, 
diesel and LPG. According to the characterisation of industrial energy consumption provided in 
MINAE (2019b), the industries that mostly consume these four fuels are the food, metal products 
and mineral (cement and glass) industries. Large industrial groups require these fuels to operate 
equipment such as ovens, boilers, emergency power generators, forklifts and internal transport, 
among others.
Decarbonisation options for the industrial sector have become an important topic in recent 
years in Costa Rica, and alternatives such as electricity-based heat generation technologies, 
electricity storage and hydrogen use are currently under discussion. Competitive incentives for 
electricity and the removal of subsidies for fossil fuels are necessary for this transition.
Finally, in the transport sector, the electric fast passenger train project for the Greater Metropolitan 
Area is under discussion, and electrification of the current private/public and passenger/cargo 
vehicle fleet is a subject of national focus. Electrification of the transport sector would not only 
create additional electricity demand, but potentially provide the flexibility that the future energy 
system would require, provided that the charging infrastructure for the electric vehicles could 
be managed smartly to avoid the peak demand surge.

BAU NDPUrban-level net zero carbon (NZC) scenario 
The NZC scenario aims to promote net zero districts. It follows the pathway of the NDP scenario, 
in terms of electrification of the transport sector (public, private and freight) and residential 
cooking, while at the same time diversifying the power supply mix by integrating non-hydropower 
renewable energy sources in the power grids. With energy efficiency improvement measures 
in the end-use sectors and the decarbonisation of industrial sectors thorough electrification 
and hydrogen, the scenario presents a more aggressive pathway, illustrated by the following 
indicators: 
• Electrification of 100% of the energy demand for cooking for the residential sector by 2035.
• Electrification of 100% of the remaining fuel-based transport by 2050 compared to the NDP 
scenario. It includes the same level of penetration of hydrogen technology as stated in the 
NDP scenario.
• Significant reduction of fossil fuel-based industry, by using electricity for two-thirds of 
the industrial sector and hydrogen for the remainder (for example, for glass and cement 
industries).
The efficiency measures follow the high-ambition scenario presented by United for Efficiency, 
which covers high-consumption appliances, specifically efficiency measures for refrigerators 
and lighting (United for Efficiency, 2019). In 2018, these appliances represented 41% of residential 
end-use demand, or more than half of the residential sector energy demand when cooking is 
included. In the NZC scenario, the transport and industry sectors switch to renewable energy, 
including green hydrogen and end-use sector coupling technologies.
This scenario includes variations aimed at quantifying the impact of sector coupling strategies 
deployed in the districts. It considers the potential of vehicle-to-grid with the utilisation of 10% 
of the battery capacity of parked electric vehicles to provide grid services, and the possibility to 
optimise importation in relation to local production of hydrogen and on-site storage.
3.2 Evaluation of municipal-level roadmaps
IRENA’s Planning Platform for Urban Renewable Energy was employed to evaluate the three 
scenarios for two key planning horizons (2035 and 2050). The tool provided five different 
optimal operating points based on multiple objectives for the same target scenario within each 
district. The five points represent different solutions that are optimal according to multiple 
objective functions considered (for example, minimisation of the annual costs of the energy 
system and minimisation of the carbon emissions during operation). 
Each Pareto optimal point represents an optimal energy system design and dispatch solution 
ranging from point 1 to point 5. Point 1 represents the design solution with the least carbon 
emissions for the minimum costs of the system (operating expenditures and capital expenditures), 
while point 5 presents the least-cost solution for the minimum carbon emissions. Each solution 
provides, for each district, a system design and operating strategy for an optimised portfolio 
of integrated energy systems to supply the energy demand of the district. Each operating 
point considers different requirements for the deployment of technologies; thus, they present Figure 16 presents the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption for each 
of the five districts for the optimised carbon emission reduction (reflecting point 5: least cost 
for minimum emissions). It illustrates the importance of policies and measures taken at the 
city level and their impact on achieving the targets. The fluctuation in the renewable energy 
share from one district to another is greater in the BAU scenario compared to the NDP and 
NZC scenarios, reflecting the impact of optimising the supply side at the district level with 
multi-energy carrier integrated systems. While it is possible to reach near net zero carbon 
in 2050 in all districts, only adequate urban energy planning combining different efficiency 
and system integration measures for the demand and supply sides would allow complete 
decarbonisation of the districts.
Medium-term planning (2035)
It is technically possible to reduce emissions in the medium term (Figure 17). The higher the 
reduction in emissions, the higher the total cost per capita per year, as more zero-emission 
technologies are needed. Most operating points in the no-policy (BAU) scenario lead to emissions 
that are higher than the values projected for 2035 in Costa Rica’s Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) (about 1.6 tonnes of CO2 per capita assuming a linear extrapolation). In 
the BAU scenario, the optimised solutions provided on the supply side within the technological 
scope of the study cannot, in most of the cases, match the NDC’s targets, except for the district

San Rafael San Isidro San Pedro San Vicente DesamparadosConversely, all the optimised supply-side solutions deployed at the urban level in the NDP 
scenario lead to lower emissions than the NDC goal by 2035. The NZC scenario makes it possible 
to further decarbonise the districts by an average of 10-15% compared to the NDC scenario. This 
is notable, as Costa Rica has committed to reducing its emissions by mid-century.
Deploying low-carbon technologies to reduce emissions in operating point 5 requires higher 
investments, as the cost of these technologies is currently high (although their cost-effectiveness 
is increasing rapidly due to economies of scale). Decarbonising San Pedro (and most likely the 
districts within the same cluster) leads to higher total costs per capita per year compared to 
the other districts. This is likely due to the high urbanisation level of the district, which leads to 
challenges in deploying certain technologies.
Conversely, San Rafael (and other districts with low population density such as those within 
cluster 5) has the lowest total costs. Districts with lower density require less investments to reach 
a low-emission target, while having higher decarbonisation potential through the deployment of 
high renewable energy generation capacity. While the results for all districts are discussed in the 
sections that follow, illustrations will focus on the two extreme districts: San Pedro and San Rafael.
Although decarbonising requires investments in renewable energy and sector-coupled 
technologies, the operational and maintenance costs are typically lower. The benefits could 
be even greater if the analysis also considered the health savings from lower emissions, as well 
as the increased productivity of cities due to reduced traffic congestion and accidents and to 
greater development and use of public transport (IDB and DDP-LAC, 2019). Figure 18 presents 
the energy carrier costs (imported electricity, oil derivatives, LPG, etc.), infrastructure costs, and 
operational and maintenance costs associated with energy use for space heating and cooling, 
electricity for electro-mobility, and electricity for all other uses in residential, commercial and 
industrial buildings, all normalised with respect to the district’s GDP.

DesamparadosThe equivalent annual costs are higher in operating point 5 for all decarbonisation scenarios 
due primarily to the electrification of the transport and industrial sectors required to lower the 
respective emissions. This implies that reaching the least emissions possible requires higher 
investments in electro-mobility and electrification of heating and cooling in buildings and 
industry. However, these costs are lower in all the other operating points despite reaching high 
electrification of these sectors. 
Investment costs in operating point 5 for all districts except San Pedro are at least double the 
costs in all other operating points (Figure 18). This is due to the deployment of technologies that 
are currently expensive in Costa Rica (for example, air-source heat pumps and energy storage 
systems). However, the results indicate that these technologies have the potential to help meet 
the decarbonisation goal within the districts by combining high-efficiency technology and the 
use of local renewable energy potential.
To meet the electricity needs of buildings, Figure 19 provides an overview of the capacity required 
for each operating point and per district. Rooftop solar PV systems were found to be the most 
cost-effective technology to enable the transition towards decentralised electricity generation 
in the representative districts. This is in line with recent global trends, as the cost-effectiveness 
of this technology has increased greatly in the last decade and will likely continue to increase 
(García de Fonseca, Parikh and Manghani, 2019).
In operating point 5, the combination of wind turbines together with solar PV systems reduces 
the impact of seasonality associated with hydropower-dominated grid electricity, maintaining 
the lowest emissions of the electricity generation. The penetration of wind turbines is greater 
in San Rafael, and most likely also in other less-dense districts that have larger areas for turbine 
deployment. Micro combined heat and power (CHP) appears in operating point 1, similarly to 
points 2, 3 and 4, demonstrating the effectiveness of co-generation at the building or community 
level, increasing the efficiency of traditional electricity-driven heaters or air conditioning systems. 
Replacing electric heaters and air conditioners with air-source heat pumps achieves a reduction

towards decarbonisation in cities. They also illustrate that other technologies are emerging 
that will enable the change needed to meet net zero emissions in 2050 while bringing socioeconomic benefits to city residents (IRENA 2020b; IRENA 2014).
The penetration of new technologies to meet the growing electricity demand in buildings 
(considering also heating and cooling requirements) in the operation point with the least 
emissions (point 5) is complemented with the deployment of energy storage systems to reduce 
the intermittency of these technologies and to enable more resilient operation of the electricity 
grid. As highlighted in Figure 20, the penetration of energy storage systems is highly correlated 
with the penetration of high volumes of energy from solar PV systems (operating point 5).

Long-term planning (2050)
Figure 21 provides an overview of the results for the 2050 horizon. While the NZC scenario 
brings higher emission-saving potential at higher costs compared to the NDP scenario, both 
high-ambition scenarios provide carbon emission savings as well as cost benefits compare 
to the BAU scenario. Following the trend for 2035, San Pedro will require the highest total 
investment, due to the higher population density and the scarcity of area for installing the most 
cost-effective technologies. Less-dense cities, such as San Rafael, will have lower total costs 
in the long term, taking advantage of the highest renewable energy potential for deploying 
combined wind and solar technologies.
The figure highlights that, despite the combination of technologies, the NDP scenario leads to 
lower total costs than the BAU scenario. This suggests that decarbonising will result in lower 
costs and higher benefits associated with a low- or zero-emissions city.
The electricity generation capacity needed to meet the districts’ demand in 2050 is expected 
to increase compared to the 2035 level, partly because the growing adoption of air-source 
heat pumps for providing heating and cooling services thanks to higher energy efficiencies 
and the resulting the lower carbon emissions (Figure 22). In addition, highly dense cities such 
as San Pedro will have the highest electricity demands in both scenarios. Rooftop solar PV 
has a higher capacity in the BAU scenario for all districts (except for less-dense cities such as 
San Rafael). These systems, combined with wind turbines, contribute substantially to reaching 
the decarbonised pathway. Adopting waste-to-energy incinerators (waste boilers) for energy

Desamparadosproduction also presents a solution, particularly as these promote the use of waste and a circular 
economy along with other benefits. It can also be observed that operating point 5 shows a 
smaller installed capacity as far as heating is concerned due to the high efficiency of the airsource heat pump technology adopted in this operation strategy.
Energy storage systems will be part of the technology mix to enable the energy transformation 
of cities (Figure 23). The penetration of storage varies by city and depends not only on the share 
of variable renewables in the power mix, but also on the availability of space. Since San Pedro 
is a highly dense city with high participation and support from the grid, the adoption of energy 
storage there was found to be lower in 2050 compared to 2035, due mainly to high electricity

scenarios, presented in the following section, include sector coupling enablers (such as an 
optimised hydrogen strategy, relevant to the NZC scenario) as well as vehicle-to-grid potential 
through the use of battery capacity made available from electric vehicles.
3.3 Alternative scenarios
To cope with the electrification of the transport sector and with industry decarbonisation 
strategies, cities will require a mix of technologies that must be integrated into multi-source 
energy systems. This might raise challenges for highly dense cities that face growing energy 
consumption as well as spatial constraints for installations. Desamparados is a dense district in 
Costa Rica, making it an interesting case study for the three evaluated scenarios and proposed 
alternatives.
Figure 24 provides an overview of the operating points of all scenarios for Desamparados 
for the years 2035 and 2050. The contributions to costs and emissions of the transport and 
industry sectors are shown in the dotted lines (the emissions and costs related to electricitydriven solutions for transport and industry are excluded from the dotted lines). The expected 
yearly emissions per capita are represented in the black line, labelled NDC. This was obtained by 
linearly interpolating the values included in MINAE (2015) for the years 2030 to 2050. 
FIGURE 24: Comparison of urban energy planning strategies for the district of 
Desamparados in 2035 and 2050

which is included within the costs and carbon emissions of the energy system represented by the point.

benefit represented by going from the BAU scenario to the NDP scenario in percentage terms 
is included with arrows. The NZC scenario was also included, and it is noted that, for 2035, 
the point of minimum carbon could be reduced by up to an additional 15% with respect to the 
NDP scenario. This point of operation of the energy system would lead Costa Rica to carbon 
neutrality in the medium term but would require greater deployment of renewable energy in the 
remaining years of the 2050 horizon, mainly to cope with electrification of the transport sector.
Similar to the other districts and within the technological scope of this study, the district of 
Desamparados would unlikely meet the NDC target by 2035 by solely deploying supply-side 
measures, as in the path of the BAU scenario. Furthermore, the BAU scenario appears to be a 
more costly pathway when considering the inclusion of distributed energy systems within the 
district. The carbon emissions related to supplying energy for buildings, industry and mobility 
can be lowered by a factor of 2 to 3 when respectively considering the NDP or the more 
aggressive NZC scenario. Most of the optimal points of the NDP and NZC scenarios can meet 
the NDC carbon emission target by 2050.
Alternative technological scopes for the NZC scenario were considered, in which sector coupling 
technologies and strategies are taken into account and their impact is quantified. The alternative 
options for the NZC scenario analysed in the following section include flexibility potential for the 
districts through sector coupling technologies, as follows:
• 10% of the battery capacity of parked electric vehicles can be used by the optimisation 
problem as storage capacity in a vehicle-to-grid configuration.
• Hydrogen technologies are adopted to provide flexibility. The model optimised local 
production (versus importation) of hydrogen, along with storage capacity and dispatch, 
considering the requirements for hydrogen applications in the end use sectors.
Combinations of those alternative scenarios are presented in Figure 25, highlighting the 
capabilities to reduce costs (by around 15%) and emissions through increased local storage 
capacities, the vehicle-to-grid strategy, and the possibility of on-site production of hydrogen.

districts such as San Rafael, where increasing the storage capabilities decreases the overall costs 
of the energy supply. For denser districts, the benefit of a storage strategy versus grid upgrade 
is lower, given a lower renewable energy potential in relation to higher electricity demand. A 
community-scale analysis can be developed to further assess the role of storage in this context.
3.4 Implications for the national grid infrastructure
The electricity imported from the grid is higher in the NDP scenario, given increased electricity 
demand as a consequence of electrification of the mobility sector. At the utility scale, the insights 
from the study provide quantification of the requirement from the national grid in terms of 
electricity imported to the districts, for the different solutions (Figure 26). These results account 
for the potential of a renewable-based distributed energy system deployed in the districts of 
Costa Rica and provide insights for the local generation, transmission and distribution utilities to 
consider when developing grid expansion planning at the regional or national scale.

Electricity Consumption (GWh)In the short term, grid imports to the districts oscillate around today’s value for the cost-minimal 
solution, despite the increase in electrification. For carbon minimisation, electricity import to 
the districts increases by up to 25% compared to today’s electricity demand. In the long term, 
electricity demand will grow in the net zero carbon districts scenario, increasing the need for 
renewable electricity import to the districts. Local renewable energy sources through distributed 
energy systems can meet part of the increased electricity demand that would come largely 
from electrification of the transport and industry sectors. Further analysis can be performed 
on the potential to optimise energy demand and supply by considering inter-district energy 
exchange, the role of storage at the community scale and demand-side management measures.
3.5 Extrapolation to the CNFL area
With the application of the clustering analysis, the district-level results were extrapolated to the 
CNFL area. This provides an estimate of the potential for renewable energy deployment within 
the area. For the optimal decarbonisation pathway, considering the minimum carbon emissions 
solutions leads to a potential installed renewable energy capacity of 1.7 gigawatts (GW) to 1.9 GW 
of solar PV and 100 MW to 200 MW of wind power, combined with the deployment of options 
providing system flexibility in 2050, including 26 MW to 80 MW of electrolyser capacity (13 MW 
fuel cell) and up to 1 GWh of electricity-based storage capacity. This provides an estimate of the 
renewable energy potential that can be harvested in and around the city as well as in the region.
Total costs per capita in cities within cluster 3 (for example, San Rafael of Escazú, Guadalupe 
of Goicoechea, San Pedro of Montes de Oca, Curridabat and Tres Rios) will tend to be higher 
than in the other clusters. Cities in cluster 2 will have the second highest total cost per capita, 
followed by cities in cluster 4 and cluster 1. Cities in cluster 5 will tend to have the lowest 
total cost per capita. There is a close correlation between the total costs per capita and the 
population density – the higher the density, the higher the total costs.
Despite the planning horizon, the results also highlight that the scenario with decarbonisation 
typically leads to lower total costs. The deployment of rooftop solar PV systems along with 
network upgrades to enable their integration was found to be key across all cities. While 
wind turbines could also help in the decarbonisation of cities, this technology was found to 
be suitable primarily for cities within cluster 5. Air-source heat pumps are a technology with 
great potential to reduce emissions, and lithium-ion batteries will enable greater integration of 
renewable energy sources. 
Table 6 provides the total emissions per capita in each of the five districts. As expected, the 
scenario with decarbonisation targets leads to operations with much lower emissions than the 
BAU scenario.
The population of cities can be used to reflect the total costs and emissions for each district, 
as well as for the total CNFL concession area. Table 7 highlights that decarbonising the CNFL 
concession area by 2050 will require total costs equal to 2.5% of the country’s GDP. Notably, the 
BAU scenario leads to higher total cost ranges. Moreover, there are extra benefits associated 
with the deployment of renewables that have not been quantified in this analysis. Table 8 
indicates that the deployment of renewable energy sources combined with an electrification 
strategy enables a reduction of up to around 5 Mt of CO2 compared to the BAU scenario. This 
reduction is achieved primarily thanks to the deployment of renewables and the electrification TABLE 6: Total per capita CO2 emissions of the energy systems in the five district clusters

Note: The table presents the variation between emissions to cost-optimal solutionsThe population for each city within the CNFL concession area and the emissions for each district 
were used to estimate the carbon emissions reductions for the NZC scenario in 2050 compared 
to the no-policy (BAU) scenario. Since all cities deploy zero-emission technologies along 
with energy efficiency measures in the NZC scenario, the reduction of emissions is significant 
(particularly for highly dense cities) and is attributed mainly to the transport sector. Cities such 
as San Rafael have the least reduction of emissions mainly because of the smaller population 
size and lower number of vehicles.
The carbon emissions are quantified for the medium-term and long-term scenarios, stacked 
by sector and scenario in Figure 27, starting with the mobility, industry and buildings sectors, 
which also include the generation of local energy, such as electricity and hydrogen, based on 
the scenario. The shaded areas in the figure represent the emissions for the different objective 
functions, with the lower end representing carbon minimisation. The maximum emission 
reduction achieved per scenario is highlighted on the figure, with the name of the scenario 
juxtaposed to the final carbon emissions reached in 2050. 
The NDP scenario provides a potential reduction in carbon emissions of 50% compared to the 
BAU scenario. Between 83% and 87% of the emissions savings, for 2035 and 2050 respectively, 
are achieved through the electrification of transport combined with the development of public 
transport. The NZC scenario provides a further 15% reduction in carbon emissions in 2035 
through efficiency measures for appliances and by switching LPG use in cooking to electricitydriven systems for buildings.

2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 20503.6 Key challenges and proposed actions
To implement the district- or city-level decarbonisation solutions as a contribution to the national 
plan in Costa Rica, a number of key challenges would need to be addressed. 
Strengthen institutional co-ordination. Urban energy planning requires the co-ordination of a 
multitude of fields, stakeholders and information in order to reach a diversity of sustainability 
objectives and trade-offs. While architects and planners must rethink buildings and spaces, local 
and regional authorities need to adapt organisational procedures; lawyers and politicians need 
to adjust legal texts and policy; and utilities must develop profitable business models. 
In addition, at the national level the co-ordination among different relevant ministries needs to 
be strengthened to address the issues around urban development and the associated growth in 
energy demand in a co-ordinated fashion and to deliver optimal solutions to both issues at the 
city level. Urban energy demand is substantially affected by urban planning and forms, while 
urban planning offers opportunities to integrate local renewable-based generation into cities. 
To achieve this, the institutional barriers that limit the penetration of renewable energy generation 
facilities in distribution networks should be removed. 
Co-ordinate charging of fleets to avoid stress on the power grid. The charging of electric 
vehicles during periods of maximum electricity demand may pose challenges to the operation 
of distribution networks, if smart charging schemes are not put in place. Distribution network 
operators must study the interactions between these technologies. Thus, detailed technical 
studies must be executed to understand the network’s ability to host the new technologies. 
Importantly, charging schemes to mitigate potential technical problems must be developed 
to allow high penetration levels of electro-mobility. The technical challenges and the cost 
effectiveness of these schemes must be assessed. 
Develop a tariff structure for the electrification of the industrial sector. There have been 
discussions in the country on the tariff for the industrial sector. The electrification of industry 
activities will require reviewing the tariff to ensure the cost-effectiveness of applications. For 
example, electrical chillers will increase electricity demand, and this will likely lead to a higher 
tariff unless new tariff schemes are deployed to offset the fuel switch from subsidised fossil fuels 
to renewable electricity. 
Interestingly, the taxation on fossil fuels used for the transport sector has represented around 
11% of government revenue – a typical case of cross-subsidisation. Electrification of the transport 
sector will reduce fossil fuel consumption, and consequentially this revenue. However, on-site 
renewable electricity generation facilities can usually bring more local job opportunities and 
economic activities, thus generating economic gains. Therefore, it would be advisable to review 
the economics of shifting away from fossil fuel to renewable electricity in a holistic approach.
Local governments manage or oversee all city activities and developments; thus, they should 
play a central role in determining the energy and carbon emission scenarios of their cities. 
They also have direct access to their citizens and are best positioned to know their needs and 
to influence their behaviour. Municipalities can also undertake significant energy savings in 
their own operations, thereby saving money, setting a good example and even testing new 
technologies (ICLEI, 2009). Based on this study, the following actions were put forth for local Create a greenhouse gas inventory to enable prioritisation of actions based on mitigation 
targets. Only 12 municipalities in Costa Rica have a greenhouse gas inventory (DCC, 2018), while 
another 11 are starting this process. The remaining municipalities should also be part of this 
initiative, as it provides a clear indication of the type of energy-related measures that will bring 
the greatest emission reduction benefits.
Design an integral long-term strategy with intermediate goals and short-term policy 
instruments. The design of a long-term strategy is essential for better planning the transition 
towards energy efficiency, electrified transport and higher shares of renewable energy sources. 
This strategy must include mid-term goals to measure progress in the interim. In addition, 
quantitative analysis that roadmaps the technological transformation along with its costs and 
benefits will enable a better decision-making process. The long-term strategy must also account 
for multiple development objectives. By incorporating different societal points of view, it is 
more likely to be accepted by the community, although this brings an extra layer of complexity. 
Co-ordination with local residents and industry within the city has to be considered in this longterm energy strategy. 
Use advanced planning tools to inform transformational plans. GIS-based tools enable 
capturing the particularities of cities for planning the energy transition, as they can be used 
to better understand the relation between energy generation and demand needs (Valverde 
et al., 2017). They also allow a better allocation of renewable energy sources accounting for 
space limitations. The planning of other key infrastructure such as the building design and waste 
management activities in cities can also benefit from GIS tools. Temporal granularities and spatial 
boundaries must be accounted for when applying these tools, given the unique geographic and 
production patterns of renewables such as wind and solar.
Involve local governments in the provision of services to bring benefits to city inhabitants. 
Local governments in the country have little or no participation in the provision of basic services 
including water, integrated waste management, electricity and transport. However, they manage 
or oversee all city activities and developments. It is therefore recommended that they be involved 
in the planning and design of these services as well as in transport planning across and within 
the city. 
Local governments should prioritise those energy-related cross-sector projects that could 
create synergies, improve the overall efficiency of resource management, and show significant 
cost savings, while building a more sustainable urban system.4

This report explored the plausible decarbonisation pathways for the Greater Metropolitan Area of 
the Central Valley in Costa Rica. This represents a potential action that sub-national governments 
can take to assist the national government in implementing the National Decarbonisation 
Plan, given that the country’s carbon emissions come mostly from the transport, industry and 
buildings sectors. Additionally, locally available renewable energy potential, particularly solar PV 
and wind energy, can in the long run be tapped into to diversify the power mix, thus enhancing 
the security of energy supply from a technical perspective. 
The study also found that sector coupling technologies and strategies will play a critical role in keeping 
the energy system operation reliable and stable while diversifying the energy supply by scaling up 
variable renewable energy sources. In this regard, through applying the Planning Platform for Urban 
Renewable Energy – a tool that IRENA has developed – different coupling options for the five 
districts located within the concession area of the state-owned power utility CNFL were evaluated 
as part of the overall analytical results, based on which the different scenarios were constructed. The 
granular temporal and geospatial analyses for those representative districts were conducted and 
the ensuing extrapolation to the Greater Metropolitan Area was taken to understand the potential 
impact on the entire area. The results show that the resultant emission reduction would be reached 
by around 90% by 2050 compared to BAU is technically possible in the NDP scenario. 
Crucially, the results demonstrate that it is possible to reach a 100% reduction in this same 
period in the NZC scenario. In other words, there are no technological barriers to meeting highambition targets by 2050. Notably, decarbonisation of the transport sector is likely to contribute 
the greatest level of emission reductions and will potentially drive other socio-economic benefits 
in cities such as lower congestion, fewer accidents, improved air quality and more jobs. Overall, 
this study has created a link between the National Decarbonisation Plan and the actions that 
local governments can take to contribute to the national carbon neutrality goal by 2050. 
However, materialising the net zero scenarios described in the study would require the removal 
of institutional and regulatory barriers to allow sub-national governments to devise specific 
plans and actions based on their localities. At the national level, the study results would enable 
better co-ordination between urban planning and energy planning. 
With the support of the planning platform to facilitate the decision-making process for long-term 
urban energy planning in cities – by analysing and optimising the technical and financial viability 
of integrating renewable energy technologies – sub-national governments could undertake 
informed planning to maximise the use of renewable energy potential with the support of sector 
coupling options to meet their energy demand. This will not only assist them in contributing REFERENCES
