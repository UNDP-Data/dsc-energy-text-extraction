Results and resources framework for Venezuela (2023-2026) ........................................................... 8I. UNDP within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation 
Framework
1. This new country programme for Venezuela is aligned with the national development 
plan priorities, the Homeland Plan, 2019-2025, the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), 2022-2026, and the UNDP strategic plan, 2022-2025. 
The programme supports sustainable development, inclusive economic growth, and 
overcoming social vulnerabilities.
2. External restrictions have had an impact on the economic situation in the country. The 
COVID-19 pandemic had an additional impact on economic variables, health and education. 
Since 2021, Venezuela has had positive economic and social recovery signs. Significant 
economic growth is expected in 2022. In this context, it is essential to develop resilience in 
the population and strengthen the processes initiated for economic growth.
3. A central challenge is to consolidate productive diversification and develop value chains, 
together with the recovery and expansion of the infrastructure of basic service systems.
4. Another challenge is articulating and reinforcing institutional capacities to boost 
economic growth and mitigate the effects of external restrictions. These challenges must be 
met while maintaining efforts to strengthen and expand social policies that promote the 
inclusion of vulnerable groups according to age, ethnicity, gender, social strata and territories, 
with a focus on leaving no one behind and in synergy with the State’s public policies and the 
National Economic and Social Development Plan, 2019-2025. Financial sustainability is one 
of the key challenges social protection initiatives will face during the economic recovery 
process.
5. Strengthening the national statistical and geographic system is a priority for UNDP as 
part of designing public policies, supporting data-based decision-making, as well as 
government programmes in poverty reduction, productive development, public services
management, malaria control and health.
6. The value added of UNDP is its positioning and credibility with national stakeholders
and its administrative strength and innovative tools, which are at the country's disposal.
7. In the previous country programme, UNDP strengthened national institutional capacities 
and policies on social protection and inclusion, productivity, environmental management, 
comprehensive disaster risk management, citizen security, public service systems, and the 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. UNDP strengthened national policies and 
institutional articulation to support the productive sector, stronger micro, small and mediumsized enterprises (MSMEs), and stronger women and youth-led MSMEs by improving
business management, entrepreneurship and digitization of business models. UNDP
strengthened value chains in strategic sectors, such as food, by promoting new financing tools 
and technical assistance. In South-South cooperation with Colombia and Ecuador, UNDP 
facilitated the exchange of methodologies to strengthen business capacities. UNDP focused 
efforts on improving connectivity in excluded communities. It improved national information 
management and decision-making capacities by supporting digital information systems in 
human rights, citizen security, national statistical data management, and disaster risk 
management.
8. As the provider of integrated solutions, UNDP articulated public and private sector 
organizations’ public policies and initiatives to promote national productive development and 
strengthen the livelihoods of vulnerable social groups. In the health sector, with the Pan 
American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), UNDP 
supported efforts to respond to the resurgence of malaria in the country. With UNFPA, UNDP 
worked to improve the response to prevent maternal mortality.
9. Based on the analysis of the results achieved in 2015-2022 and consultations with 
national counterparts, UNDP has integrated lessons learned and good practices into this country programme. The lessons show that reducing the overall vulnerability of the people in 
Venezuela requires:
1
(a) a systemic and multisectoral approach to public problems based on 
strengthening governance, efficiency, effectiveness and closing the digital divide in public 
institutions, as well as connectivity among national actors to generate comprehensive 
strategies; (b) macroeconomic stabilization of the country, while promoting a diversified and 
sustainable productive development model, essential to generate decent employment 
opportunities and develop the necessary investments that favour public service systems;
2
(c) increased efficiency and scope of social protection systems and effective strategies to 
reduce inequality and poverty; (d) fostered financing, productivity and competitiveness, 
closing the digital divide in MSMEs and linking them to the national science and technology 
system; (e) articulated policies for environmental management, climate change and integrated 
disaster risk management, necessary to increase community resilience and protect 
biodiversity; (f) strengthened statistical data to develop a culture of information management 
for decision-making and evidence-based programming and results monitoring;
(g) strengthened multisectoral approach and prevention strategies to address citizen 
insecurity; and (h) diversified sources of financing for development, given the limited fiscal 
space and absence of external financing in the country.
II. Programme priorities and partnerships
10. The country programme vision is to support Venezuela to accelerate the achievement of 
the Sustainable Development Goals (hereafter, the Goals), contributing to the construction of 
a resilient, just and equitable society, with a dignified life, by promoting socially inclusive 
and environmentally sustainable economic development, contributing to integral human 
development. UNDP will promote social policies focused on poverty reduction, optimization 
of essential social services systems, mitigation and adaptation to the effects of climate change, 
and comprehensive disaster risk management, along with the implementation of measures for 
biodiversity conservation and the improvement of urban and rural environmental management 
with a territorial approach, to reduce the vulnerability of the population to socioeconomic and 
socio-environmental events.
11. The country programme is based on and was developed in parallel with the UNSDCF. 
UNDP participated with United Nations system organizations in drafting the common country 
analysis and holding stakeholder consultations with civil society, academia, the private sector,
and the Government to identify and prioritize the country's development challenges. The 
consultation process included stakeholders, linked to the mandates of the United Nations 
organizations, and vulnerable groups, emphasizing the participation of women and youth.
12. The programme’s general theory of change is based on promoting the improvement of 
State institutions’ capacities and articulating with stakeholders ways to improve institutional 
efficiency in public management. Good governance at the national and local levels will 
contribute to improving the development of sectoral plans, the design, implementation and 
evaluation of public policies, as well as monitoring and follow-up of the National Economic 
and Social Development Plan, 2019-2025, the Homeland Plan 2019-2025, and progress 
towards the achievement of the Goals. The theory of change, therefore, posits the following.
13. If the management capacity of the institutions and the mechanisms of vertical and 
horizontal articulation between the levels of the Government and the private sector, academia,
civil society and community-based organizations improve, the population will benefit from: 
the implementation of social policies focused on poverty reduction and taking advantage of 
the demographic dividend, inclusive social protection systems, better functioning of basic and 
1 United Nations system in Venezuela, 2020. “Plan de respuesta económico y social ante la COVID-19 en Venezuela”.
2 UNDP in Venezuela
2020“El impacto económico del COVID-19 en Venezuela: La urgencia del financiamiento externo”essential services systems, and the population's continuous access to them, in an environment 
of citizen security, with a gender focus.
14. If productive chains are strengthened to generate more decent work opportunities, income
and better access to basic goods and services, the population will benefit from socially 
inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic development, because shared prosperity 
would be generated from a productive development strategy that promotes scientific and 
technological innovation, entrepreneurship, productivity and competitiveness.
15. As a result, economic development with a sustainable approach could serve as a basis for 
promoting integrated territorial development at the local level, without environmental 
degradation of marine and terrestrial ecosystems, strengthening urban and rural environmental 
management, and preserving biological diversity as the basis for the ecological sustainability 
of development and the reduction of the vulnerability of communities to disasters and global 
changes, while improving adaptation and mitigation to the effects of climate change.
16. Programmatic interventions in the social, economic and environmental spheres will 
contribute to the comprehensive management of human development by improving the 
quality of life and resilience of the population in the face of socioeconomic and socioenvironmental shocks and global changes, by protecting and promoting economic, social, 
cultural and environmental rights through social protection and redistributive policies that 
reduce vulnerability, poverty and inequality, with a gender focus, leaving no one behind.
17. Increasing the availability of internal and external financing and creating national 
conditions to strengthen the institutional capacities of the State and the reactivation of the 
national productive sector will be fundamental to achieving the scope of this programme,
Gender perspective, equity, resilience and intergenerational and human rights approach
18. Within national public policies and from a rights and gender perspective, UNDP will 
coordinate with the State to strengthen institutional capacities at the national, regional and 
local levels to reduce barriers that limit human development's comprehensive and inclusive 
management. The barriers generate persistent poverty that intensifies inequality, exclusion 
and citizen insecurity. With the Ministry of People's Power for Planning (MPPP) and the 
institutional and sectoral bodies that make up the national statistical and geographic system, 
UNDP will strengthen the design, monitoring and evaluation of policies and progress toward 
the Goals. It will also strengthen national institutions responsible for implementing poverty 
reduction, social protection and inclusion policies to help them improve inter-institutional 
coordination mechanisms and increase the effectiveness and coverage of these policies while 
promoting the closing of the digital divide. It will work from a multidimensional approach in 
alliance with the Ministry of People's Power of the Office of the Presidency and Follow-up of 
Government Management (MPPDPSGG), the Ministry of People's Power for Youth and 
Sports (MPPJD), the Ministry of People's Power for Women and Gender Equality 
(MINMUJER), and the Ministry of People's Power for Indigenous Peoples (MINPI). 
19. Cooperation will cover efficiency in delivering basic and essential social services for a 
dignified life. UNDP will consolidate alliances at the national, regional and local levels with 
social actors in coordination with the Sectoral Vice-Presidencies of Planning and Services. 
With the Ministry of People's Power for Water (MINAGUAS) and the Ministry of People's 
Power for Ecosocialism (MINEC), UNDP will promote the integral management of the 
country's water resources and solid waste. With the Ministry of People's Power for Electric 
Energy (MPPEE), UNDP will strengthen the national electric system and cooperation with 
the Ministry of People's Power for Transportation (MPPT) on integral land use and 
transportation system.
20. With the Ministry of People's Power for Health (MPPS), UNDP will work to improve the 
capacity of the national health system to attend to the neediest populations. UNDP will continue to serve as the principal recipient of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis 
and Malaria to improve the response to the resurgence of malaria by collaborating with PAHO
and WHO and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).
Enhance sustainable, resilient, and innovative productive development, aligned with 
environmental management and climate change action
21. This priority area encompasses two country programme outcomes. UNDP will contribute 
to national efforts to promote socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic 
development. It will focus on social welfare, leaving no one behind, diversifying the 
productive matrix, developing value chains, improving performance, financing opportunities,
and enhancing the competitiveness of MSMEs and dynamic enterprises. With the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Industrial 
Development Organization (UNIDO), UNDP will promote production, responsible 
consumption, respect for the environment, and addressing scientific and technological 
challenges of the productive sector. UNDP will work with regional and local governments, 
business chambers and the Ministry of People’s Power for Industries (MPPIPN), the Ministry
of People’s Power for Science and Technology (MINCYT), the Ministry of People’s Power 
for Economy, Finance and Foreign Trade (MPPEFCE), the MINEC, and the Ministry of 
People’s Power for the Social Process of Labour (MPPPST). UNDP will consider the 
productive engines prioritized in the country to promote growth patterns that improve income 
distribution, access to the social process of labour and job market inclusion by the most 
vulnerable people.
22. With the MPPP, MINEC, and the Ministry of People’s Power for Habitat and Housing 
(MINHVI), UNDP will strengthen public management capacities at the different levels of 
government to promote development and territorial planning, sustainable use of the territory, 
natural resources protection, and models of sustainable and resilient cities. UNDP will 
enhance resilience to adverse socio-natural and technological events and the effects of climate 
change. UNDP will work with MINEC – the national designated authority to the Green 
Climate Fund – and the National Committee of the Green Climate Fund to strengthen climate 
governance and the development of national policies, plans and programmes for climate 
change mitigation and adaptation to reinforce national policies for environmental 
management and biodiversity protection. 
23. With the Ministry of People’s Power for Internal Relations, Justice and Peace 
(MPPRIJP), the Simon Bolivar National Geographic Institute, and MINEC, UNDP will
promote integrated disaster risk management in State institutions and communities. UNDP 
will identify opportunities with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UNHabitat), the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), MINHVI and MPPP to build a 
model of sustainable urbanism.
Promoting sustainable, inclusive, and egalitarian social cohesion
24. UNDP will strengthen capacities to reinforce governance and increase the efficiency of 
public management by working with MPPRIJP, MPPP, the Federal Council of Government 
(CFG), and the Vice-Presidencies of the Republic. With the Office of the Comptroller General 
of the Republic and the National Office for the Comprehensive Care of Victims of Violence 
(ONAIVV), UNDP will strengthen digital architecture and capacities to improve the design 
and monitoring of security and criminal justice institutions’ services delivery. UNDP will also 
support information management processes for a multidimensional approach to citizen 
security. Together with UNFPA, the United Nations Children's Fund, and the United Nations 
Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), UNDP will 
advocate for gender equality.
25. South-South and triangular cooperation partnerships will be explored to address
challenges to good governance, in alignment with: (a) the National Economic and SocialDevelopment Plan, 2019-2025; (b) the UNSDCF; (c) the five priorities of the 2030 Agenda –
people, prosperity, planet, peace and partnerships; and (d) the guiding principles of this
country programme: leaving no one behind, a human rights-based approach to development, 
gender equality, women’s empowerment, resilience, sustainability and accountability.
26. As a provider of integrated solutions, UNDP will coordinate the multidimensional, 
multisectoral and multi-stakeholder approach to address the structural causes of the identified 
development challenges. UNDP and its partners will strengthen policies, strategies and 
frameworks that enhance national institutional capacities and those of the most vulnerable 
populations, increase resilience to adverse events and global changes, and foster sustainable 
development.
III. Programme and risk management
27. This country programme document outlines UNDP contributions to national results and
serves as the primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board for results alignment and 
resources assigned to the programme at the country level. Accountabilities of managers at the 
country, regional and headquarters levels with respect to country programmes are prescribed 
in the organization’s programme and operations policies and procedures, and internal control 
framework.
28. The programme will be nationally executed. If necessary, national execution may be 
replaced by direct execution for part or all of the programme to enable response to force 
majeure. The harmonized approach to cash transfers (HACT) will be used in a coordinated 
fashion with other United Nations organizations to manage financial risks. Cost definitions 
and classifications for programme effectiveness and development activities will be charged to 
the concerned projects.
29. The main risks to the programme are: (a) variations in the priorities established due to 
structural changes of institutions; (b) scarcity of resources for development derived from the 
effects of external factors; (c) economic and fiscal impacts due to global dynamics; (d) natural, 
hydro-meteorological or seismic events with great human impact, caused by climate change 
or the seismic nature of the country; (e) decrease in the domestic supply due to the interruption 
of production caused by the measures taken to face the COVID-19 pandemic; and (f) an 
increase in the COVID-19 pandemic due to new variants that could exacerbate the social 
vulnerability of households. UNDP will strengthen partnerships with other United Nations
entities and international donors to address these risks and improve public institutions’
capacity to mitigate them, supporting information management decision-making processes.
30. The programme is based on the principle of leaving no one behind, by incorporating the 
guiding principles of human rights, gender equality, women's empowerment, accountability, 
sustainability and resilience. The UNDP accountability framework underscores its 
commitment to results and risk-based performance management, as well as shared values and 
a culture of accountability and transparency, following the UNDP enterprise risk management 
policy. The UNDP social and environmental standards and accountability mechanism will be 
applied to programme interventions to identify potential risks and unintended consequences. 
IV. Monitoring and evaluation
31. UNDP will use gender analysis to plan and monitor investments and results. Systematic 
use of the gender marker will be implemented to monitor spending and improve gender-based 
planning and decision-making.
32. UNDP will allocate at least 3 per cent of the programme budget from projects to cover 
monitoring, evaluation and communication costs. A balanced evaluation plan will be 
implemented to ensure learning and accountability, in agreement with the Government, following the UNDP evaluation policy and United Nations Evaluation Group guidelines. An 
independent mid-term and final evaluation plan of the projects and their results will be 
established.
33. National data sources will be prioritized to monitor programme indicators, ensuring 
accountability to stakeholders and reviewing the effectiveness of interventions to support 
partnership-building and resource mobilization. UNDP will coordinate and support the United 
Nations system's planning, monitoring and reporting system. The data system will be 
coordinated with the national statistical and geographic system.
34. UNDP will strengthen decision-making and development planning data, as part of its 
national capacity development offer. UNDP will support the strengthening and updating 
digital tools employed by information systems, which are key for monitoring the advancement 
of the Goals. UNDP will support MPPP in recording information based on monitoring 
indicators to track the results of interventions targeting populations at risk of being left behind
and the institutions benefiting from UNDP cooperation and technical assistance. To this end, 
UNDP will ensure the articulation with and the strengthening of the national statistical and 
geographical system.Annex. Results and resources framework for Venezuela (2023-2026)
