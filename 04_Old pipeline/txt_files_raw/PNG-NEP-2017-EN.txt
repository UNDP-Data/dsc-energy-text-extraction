126meagre 13% by 2017. PNG’s energy sector was developed through various Acts of Parliament but its 
development was not coordinated properly for a period of 40 years since attainment of political 
Independence in 1975. This is a truly sad story, which the Nation cannot be proud of or accept. 
Something drastic must be done and done quickly to address this energy situation in our country.
I am proud that an overarching policy on Energy is now finally completed for me to present to the 
people of Papua New Guinea. The National Energy Policy will provide the enabling environment to 
achieve, the 2030 target for 70 percent electricity access to all households in PNG and 100 percent by 
2050 using renewable energy resources.
I believe this Energy Policy is on par with modern energy development practices across the globe, fully 
utilising all our energy sources for domestic use and eventually for export. 
The global energy sector is continually evolving and PNG must be at the forefront of utilising new 
technologies to harness our local energy sources having due regard to the environment. This policy 
advocates a balanced approach to energy production and supply, using existing technologies where 
appropriate and deploying new technologies.
I am grateful to the O’Neill Government for giving me the opportunity to drive the reform in the energy 
sector which is good for all beneficiaries, domestic, commercial and industrial users of energy.
This policy will also drive economic growth through efficient, reliable and affordable energy access 
across commercial and industrial sectors.
FOREWORD BY THE MINISTER
Energy is of vital importance for the sustainable 
development of our country. Countries that have 
placed energy in the forefront of their policies have 
and are experiencing leaps and bounds in their 
economic growth and prosperity. Energy is the 
engine room for economic development for any 
successful nation. 
God has blessed Papua New Guinea abundantly 
with all natural resources of energy which are 
waiting to be harnessed to advance the economic 
growth, energy security, environmental sustainability 
and social welfare of our people and country. 
Unfortunately, since 1963 when electricity became 
publicly available for domestic and commercial 
use, its development and access has reached aMinister for Communications, Information
Technology & Energy - 2017
To implement the Policy. I am pleased to announce that the National Electrification Roll-out Plan 
(NEROP) is at advanced stages of being finalised and other sub-sector plans will be developed soon 
after the launching of the National Energy Policy. 
This policy will be the basis of energising and powering PNG to be a smart, happy, prosperous, wealthy 
and modern nation. have contributed at different times over the last twenty years, along the long and arduous journey 
of energy policy development. All these collective contributions have finally culminated in what I believe 
is a comprehensive and over-arching National Energy Policy for Papua New Guinea. At the outset, 
I wish to thank Hon. Peter O’Neill, CMG MP, Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea and the National 
Executive Council for directing the Departments of Petroleum and Energy and Public Enterprises to 
recommence the process of National Energy Policy development in 2014/2015.
I acknowledge and thank Hon. Samuel H. Basil, MP, Minister for Communication, Information Technology 
and Energy, Hon. William Duma CMG MP, Minister for Public Enterprises and State Investments and 
Hon. Dr. Fabian Pok MP, Minister for Petroleum for their guidance in the development of National 
Energy Policy. Credit is also due to former Ministers Sir Moi Avei, Nixon Duban and Ben Micah for their 
support and contribution to the development of the National Energy Policy. 
At the bureaucratic level I express my sincere appreciation to Dr. Clement Waine, the Secretary for 
Public Enterprises for providing intellectual capital at the many collaborative gatherings of representatives 
of civil servants, academia and civil society. I acknowledge with deep respect for Mr Vore Veve, a Papua 
New Guinean who has spent most of his working life campaigning for development of renewable energy.
On a personal note I thank Hon. Samuel H. Basil, MP for his confidence in appointing me to Chair the 
last of the gatherings of energy experts - the Energy Working Group on the National Energy Policy. In 
his first address to the Working Group the Minister said: “the challenge for the Energy Working Group is 
to successfully separate the two (2) Siamese Twins”; metaphorically speaking of the task of separating 
petroleum from energy after the Prime Minister appointed him as Minister for Energy. I am pleased to 
say the Energy Working Group has delivered on that challenge and more - thus creating a clear 
demarcation between petroleum and energy, and sets the stage for development of the vast natural 
renewable energy resources, which, in my view, will far exceed all of our expectations, in terms of its 
contribution to long term energy security of Papua New Guinea
By the Chairman - Energy Working Group
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Development of policy for the renewable natural energy 
resources of Papua New Guinea over almost two (2) 
decades has largely taken a back seat and treated as 
the ‘Cinderella’ of the petroleum and energy sector. 
Petroleum has enjoyed the limelight since the discovery 
and development of the Kutubu Oil Fields. Bringing 
together non-renewable (petroleum) and renewable 
(hydro, solar, wind, biomass, etc.) energy under one 
policy, especially in the downstream marketing, sale 
and/or distribution of energy products is a milestone in 
meeting the ever increasing commercial, industrial and 
domestic energy needs of the country. I take this 
opportunity to recognise and commend the many 
individuals and organisations, including World Bank, 
AusAid and University of Technology of Sydney, whichI commend one and all for your contribution to the new National Energy Policy: Harnessing Energy 
for Life. May our beautiful country - Papua New Guinea, prosper through this National Energy Policy. 
God bless you all.
Joseph Gabut, OBE
Chairman
Energy Working GroupEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Energy is the engine of economic growth. Therefore the Government recognises the need to manage 
the energy sector in a manner that is efficient and sustainable. Development of the country’s 
energy resources therefore will be coordinated in a manner that guarantees PNG attains sustainable 
income from energy exports while at the same time, the Goverment wants to see the unit cost of 
energy reduced in order to make PNG an internationally competitive country to invest in.
The provision of reliable, accessible and affordable energy contributes to economic and social 
development, and development in turn depends on more use of energy for the nation’s 
sustenance but in a manner that is technically sound and the sector is efficiently regulated. 
Hence, this policy is all about finding a balance between making PNG an attractive 
investment destination for exporting energy to the energy hungry world and at the same time 
promoting PNG’s economic development based on low energy cost.
The overall objective of the energy policy is to ensure affordable, competitive, sustainable and 
reliable supply of energy to meet national and provincial development needs at least cost, while 
protecting and conserving the environment.
The energy sector is guided by the Oil and Gas Act 1998, Mining Act 1992, Electricity Industry Act 
2002 and a number of other legislations. With the adoption of the PNG Vision 2050, there is need 
to formulate both the policy and accompanying legislations so as to align them with the Vision; the 
statutes shall be reviewed and consolidated into one.
The Energy sector currently accounts for 14 % of the GDP. The contribution to the GDP growth is 
attributed to the PNG LNG project. With the adoption of this policy, the renewable energy sector 
will also contribute to increase in GDP.
The Energy Sector constitutes two (2) energy sources: (i) fossil fuels (including petroleum, natural 
gas and coal); and (ii) renewable energy (including hydro, geothermal, solar, wind, tidal wave, 
ocean current, biofuel).

OVERVIEW OF THE ENERGY SECTOR
Papua New Guinea has considerable recoverable natural gas reserves and fast diminishing 
reserves of oil. In order to fast track more petroleum discoveries in the country, the Government 
will intensify primary data acquisition and make it available to investors to attract them to 
undertake more exploration activities within the country.
Papua New Guinea’s hydrocarbon basins are primarily gas-prone although a few oil discoveries 
have been made. The current oil fields are on the decline and any future significant hydrocarbon 
discoveries will be gas fields. The industry is governed by the Oil and Gas Act 1998 and is 
largely export-driven. The gas required for domestic consumption primarily for power is relatively 
small and subject to commercial consideration
7

FOSSIL FUELSThere is therefore a need to develop adequate petroleum production capacity in the country, and 
also develop the petroleum supply infrastructure to meet market requirements to match the 
increasing demand for petroleum products locally and in the region.
Coal is an affordable, competitive, reliable and easily accessible source of energy, especially for 
electricity generation. Some coal exploration has taken place in Gulf Province. More coal 
exploration is going on in other parts of the country.
.
The Government shall promote an intensive coal exploration programme and efficient utilisation 
of coal resources while minimising the environmental impacts associated with its use. It will 
establish data and information on coal resources.
Renewable energy, derived from the naturally occurring resources including geothermal, hydro, 
solar, wind, tidal wave energy, biomass, biofuels, biogas and municipal waste can supply our 
needs and those of future generations in a sustainable way if effectively harnessed through 
careful planning and advanced technology. In addition, renewable energy has the potential to 
enhance energy security, mitigate climate change, generate income, create employment and 
generate foreign exchange savings. 
Papua New Guinea has huge hydro power potential, currently estimated at 15.000MW1 , which 
if developed, could significantly boost PNG’s energy production potential.
The Government shall establish the National Energy Authority of Papua New Guinea (NEA) to 
be the umbrella agency for development of renewable energy resources.
The Government shall establish the Energy Regulatory Commission (ENERCOM) to take 
custody of all regulatory functions within the renewable energy and electricity industries and 
some downstream petroleum activities.
Electricity is a secondary source of energy generated through the consumption of primary 
energy sources. By virtue of its versatility in application, electricity is crucial to the socio-economic 
development of the country and is the most sought after energy service, access to which is 
associated with rising or high quality of life. In order to ensure there is affordable and accessible 
electricity supply, there is a need to restructure and reform the electricity supply industry.
Reform of the electricity sector is required in view of the very low access, at 13%, to the people 
of PNG since 1963 when electricity first became available in the country. It is time for review 
and reform of the sector.
lt is very clear that PNG Power Limited which has been in the forefront of energy delivery services 
in the country has done very little to change the picture of very low power access to the people

Explore and adopt all viable financing options from local and international sources for cost 
effective utilization of all its energy resources, and in so doing shall endeavour to maintain 
a competitive fiscal investment climate in the country.
Support Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in the development, operation and maintenance of 
energy infrastructure and delivery systems.
The government recognises that it is of crucial importance to promote and encourage citizens and national 
participation in the development of energy resources, downstream processing of energy sources, domestic 
market obligations of energy developers, rehabilitation of projects and the adequate human resourcing of 
energy projects.
The government shall promote local and national participation by citizens and SOEs into all aspects of 
exploration, development and commercialization activities associated with oil, gas, coal and geothermal 
projects.
In time, it is contemplated that as the energy industry evolves into one of increasing scale 
(where local power generation exceeds demand) and sophistication, with multiple interconnected 
generators the National Electricity Market will be developed where electricity will be traded as a 
commodity in a country and exported overseas. It will involve both wholesale generation that
is transported via interconnected grid of high voltage transmission lines to electricity distributors, 
who deliver it to consumers (homes and businesses). In the long run the transport of electricity 
from generators to consumers is facilitated through a ‘pool’, or spot market, where the output 
from all generators is aggregated and scheduled at five minute intervals to meet demand.
25The importance of energy efficiency and conservation measures in the Papua New Guinean 
economy cannot be overemphasized. Challenges to implementation of energy efficiency and 
conservation initiatives include lack of awareness of the benefits and methods of conservation, 
apathy, limited technical capacity and inadequate data. This policy contains some of the initiatives 
to address these concerns.
In carrying out its planning and development function regarding electricity, gas reticulation and 
energy regulation, every Provincial Government shall set aside suitable land for energy infrastructure 
development purposes, including but not limited to projects recommended in the national 
energy plans.
The NEA may establish directorates with responsibility for policy development as well as 
integrated national planning in the areas of downstream oil and gas, coal resources, renewable 
energy, electricity, nuclear energy for electricity generation as well as energy efficiency and 
conservation.
Research, Development and Dissemination as well as human resource development are key in 
achieving the objectives of this policy. This will be done through existing institutions that are in 
place in collaboration with National Energy Authority.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION
LAND, ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY
CROSS CUTTING ISSUESDuring the colonial era there was little development in the energy sector. Even now; energy 
development has not kept pace with the evolution of the economy. PNG’s future economic growth 
requires a rapid increase in harnessing the energy resources of the country in a sustainable manner.
Energy security is all about the continuous availability of energy at all times in various forms, in 
sufficient quantities and at affordable prices. These conditions must prevail over the long term 
because energy contributes to sustainable development and growth of any nation. In PNG, 
attention to energy security is critical because of the export of all the produced oil and gas and 
yet to be developed substantial natural renewable energy resources. Thus, energy supply could 
become more vulnerable over the near term due to PNG’s growing reliance on imported petroleum 
products. Energy supply has been stable in the past 50 years and has contributed to the 
economic development of the nation, however, the potential for conflict, sabotage, disruption of trade, 
and reduction in strategic reserves and increasing oil prices cannot be dismissed. These potential 
threats point to the necessity of strengthening national energy security.
Papua New Guinea has significant potential of indigenous energy resources and reserves 
including oil, gas, coal, hydro, biomass and other renewable energy that can be harnessed to 
accelerate PNG’s development and progress in leaps and bounds. The energy sector currently 
accounts for 14% of the country’s GDP, on the back of the successful World class PNG LNG project 
which commenced shipment of gas to overseas market in April 2014. The PNG Energy Sector 
has the potential to provide the foundation for growth for all other sectors in building a modern 
PNG economy. This can only happen if PNG makes substantial investment in the development of 
the energy sector.
Energy shortages and supply disruptions together with high cost remains serious obstacles to 
economic activity and growth in PNG. At present, eighty seven percent (87%) of PNG’s population 
still lack access to electricity services and the progress of rural electrification has lagged over the 
years. This is due to the prolonged absence of an overarching energy policy to guide the 
development of the energy sector. In addition, the lack of political foresight, the high delivery costs 
and the lack of investment due to PNG’s rugged topography and sparsely distributed population are 
major impediments to delivery of accessible, reliable, affordable energy and electricity services. In 
2011, the O’Neill Government took an important first step by approving the Electricity Industry 
Policy (EIP) and National Electrification Rolf-out Plan (NEROP) to begin a 15 year programme on 
rural electrification. This policy is the overarching framework for development of the energy sub 
sector policies and plans.
The National Government envisions through its PNG DSP 2010 - 2030 that seventy percent (70 %) 
of the country will have access to electricity by 2030. The Vision 2050 in turn envisions one 
hundred percent (100%) power supply from renewable and sustainable energy sources.

OVERVIEW OF ENERGY SECTOR IN PNG
Papua New Guinea has attained a strong economic growth achieving an average of 6.0% annual 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate from 2005 - 2014 with projections of over 16% growth 
in 2015 and beyond.
The energy sector currently accounts for 14% of the country’s GDP and is a critical enabler for all 
other sectors for building a modern PNG economy. Major developments are expected in the energy 
sector and the economy on the back of the successful commencement of the world class PNG 
LNG project in 2014. The Energy sector will continue to contribute substantially to that growth.
The Energy Sector includes assets related to three (3) key energy resources: (i) electric power, 
(ii) fossil fuels (including petroleum, natural gas and coal); and (iii) renewable energy including 
hydro, biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, tidal waves, ocean currents and biofuel. Each of these 
energy sources have been dealt with in detail in the subsequent chapters of this Policy.
PNG is richly endowed with renewable energy sources that when harness can meet the Vision 
2050 target of PNG been 100% power by renewable sources. It is estimated that PNG has 
hydro power potential of about 15,000MW comprising large and small hydros2 .
The electricity portion of the Energy Sector includes the generation, transmission, and distribution 
and retail of electricity.
Currently, there are two main stand-alone power grids—in Port Moresby (NCD Grid) and in the 
Lae-Madang-Highlands area (Ramu Grid)—and a number of smaller grids that service the smaller 
urban centres. Because of the unreliability of grid supply, there is considerable self-generation and 
back-up generation taking place in urban areas, but maintenance and operation costs are high and 
efficiencies low.
PNG has about 797 megawatts (MW) of installed generation capacity, including hydro power 
(432 MW or 54%) diesel (217 MW or 27%), gas-fired (85 MW or 11%), and geothermal (56 MW or 
7%) and biomass (7MW or 1%). PNG has significant underutilized indigenous energy sources such 
as hydropower, biomass, natural gas, geothermal and solar.
PNG Power Limited (PPL), the national state-owned corporatized power utility, manages installed 
generation capacity of about 300 MW, including the two main grids and 19 independent power 
systems that service 26 smaller urban centres. The remaining capacity of about 280 MW 
comprises: (i) self-generation systems owned and operated by industrial facilities, including mining 
companies; and (ii) private sector generators supplying the main grids or rural communities. The
government’s ownership in PPL is maintained through the Kumul Consolidated Holdings Limited 
(formerly Independent Public Business Corporation).
2In Papua New Guinea (PNG), about 13% of the household population has access to electricity. 
Where power is available (generally in the main urban centres) the supply is often unreliable. 
Access to electricity is very limited in off-grid rural areas. Lack of access to affordable, reliable 
power is limiting economic growth in urban areas, constraining growth in smaller urban centres, 
and contributing to poverty in rural areas.
Sector policy formulation is managed by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy specifically the 
Energy Wing.
Technical regulation of the sector is performed by PPL itself through agreement with the 
Independent Consumer and Competition Commission; however, although it is intended to 
eventually transfer this function to the Energy Wing. Through this policy it should be transferred 
to the National Energy Authority.
Key research activity in the power sector occurs at the University of Technology in Lae, particularly 
through the Rural Energy Research Group. Through this policy an Institute will be established for 
Energy RD&D. 
Based on the Government’s policy to create a new Energy Ministry to develop a National Energy 
Policy for the country. The NEP will focus largely on renewable sources. This policy does not deal 
with the upstream Oil and Gas industries. 
PNG’s current energy mix is dominated by diesel and other petroleum refined products.
Based on APERC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook 6th Edition (2016) Papua New Guinea’s 
total primary energy supply (TPES) is projected to grow approximately six fold from 2 Mtoe in 2013 
to 11.9 Mtoe in 2040 as shown in Figure 1. Oil and gas dominate supply with a small contribution 
from renewables, primarily hydro and also geothermal and biofuels. Oil and gas will preserve their 
overall dominant role throughout the Outlook period with their share increasing from 80% in 2013 
to more than 90% in 2040. The share and volume of gas will rise significantly, from 5% (0.1 Mtoe) 
to more than 46% (5.5 Mtoe), thanks to the growing production of gas as oil reserves drying up. 
The volume for oil increases from 1.5 Mtoe to 5.3 Mtoe but its share fell from 75% to above 44%.

2.2 PNG’S ENERGY MIXFigure 1 • Papua New Guinea; Total primary energy supply by fuel, 2000-40
Source: APERC, 2016
Consumer energy demand in PNG mostly depends on three main fuels; electricity, diesel and 
biomass. In terms of primary energy supply, in 2015 by-products of oil and gas account for 
approximately 51%, biomass 39% and hydropower 7% and geothermal 3%. Products of oil and 
gas constitute most of the share in the total primary energy supply for domestic use at current 
trend. The demand for heavy diesel and other oil products is concentrated in the industrial sector, 
followed by electricity and transport while the demand for natural gas products will be driven by 
the need for increase in electricity generation.
As at 2014 diesel and other petroleum products accounts for about 57% of the total primary 
energy consumed in the country. Diesel and other petroleum products are mainly used in the 
transport, power generation, commercial and industrial sectors as well as households. There is 
no coal usage in the country. Chapter 3 treated fossil fuels in greater detail in terms of upstream, 
mid and downstream petroleum and gas.

5
OIL AND DIESEL PRODUCTSThe current installed electricity capacity of PNG is approximately 797 MW. Hydro and Diesel 
currently dominate the share of electricity generation. The Government’s Vision 2050 directs that 
by 2050 all electricity supply security must come from renewable energy sources. The Government 
is now on the trajectory to reduce its reliance on diesel power generation and switch its allegiance 
to renewable energy sources. By 2050 the electricity mix for PNG would be almost totally from 
renewable energy sources with shares from wind and solar. Figure 2 and 3 overleaf shows the 
current electricity generation mix and the projected mix from periods 2030 - 2050. 
Renewable Energy is the most abundant source of energy in PNG and if fully and cost-effectively 
harnessed could contribute up to 100 percent powering of electricity in the country. PNG is 
endowed with many of these resources. However, the drawback is the costs involved with their 
implementation and the maturity of the technology to harness electricity.
Current potential of Hydropower is estimated at 15,000 MW with Geothermal at 10,000 MW, 
Solar, Wind and Biomass also have significant potential and are planned to be harnessed in the

The Government must ensure that some gas is made available to complement other renewable 
energy supply sources for domestic use in power generation to help meet the 70 percent of 
the households to be electrified by 2030. Then to progress upwards to meet the remaining 
30 percent after 2030 and by 2050 all households must be electrified in terms of electricity 
connectivity. Close coordination is therefore required with PNG’s industrialization policy and
strategy so that clear economic goals and objectives are established for a domestic gas 
reservation policy.

GAS2.3 LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
2.3.1 CONSTITUTION OF THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA
Energy is a broader subject with its various legal and regulatory environment loosely administered 
by various organizations under different laws.
Papua New Guinea’s governing laws on the industry include: the Constitution of the Independent 
State of Papua New Guinea, Independent Consumer & Competition Commission Act 2002, 
Electricity Industry Act 2002, Oil & Gas Act 1996 and the Mining Act 1992. There are other key 
supporting legislations though that provides a cumbersome and loose legal framework within 
which the energy sector operates.
These institutions and agencies have their own weaknesses and challenges, together with the 
laws they are administering, some of which date back to as far as independence days. Given such 
an operating environment it would be an understatement to suggest any one legal and regulatory 
framework.
The Gas Policy 1995 and the Oil and Gas Act 1996 has served the nation well as evidenced from 
the successful commercialization of first LNG project, the PNG LNG Project and large investment 
flowing into the next two projects. A review of the oil and gas fiscal regime and regulatory framework 
has started under the auspices of the Tax Review Committee chaired by Sir Nagora Bogan.
Nonetheless, there is a critical need for a paradigm shift in PNG’s Petroleum and Energy Policy 
and Regulatory regime because PNG as a host country cannot easily access oil and gas for its 
domestic requirements while the prospect of purchase of oil and gas for domestic consumption 
comes at an exorbitant price.
This Policy recognizes these many challenges and shortfalls some of which include fiscal, funding, 
legal and policy vacuums, institutional, technical, entrepreneurial abilities, knowledge, environment 
and social. It aims to address the immediate needs of the industry, especially in so far as energy 
uses for electricity is concerned to kick-start the process of aligning the legislative and policy 
environment.
In the Preamble to the Constitution, National Goal and Directive Principle three (3) provides 
for the Government to base their planning for the political, economic and social development 
and take effective measures to control and actively participate in the national economic and 
in particular to control major enterprises engaged in the exploitation of natural resources.
Goal four (4) provides for Papua New Guinea’s natural resources and environment to be 
conserved and used for the collective benefit of all, and be replenished for the benefit of 
future generations.
These provisions in essence, provides for the aligning of the energy sector policy, legal and 
regulatory framework with these provisions, spirit and aspirations of the Constitution.

32.3.2 CURRENT POLICY AND LEGISLATION
There are several policies and legislations which have an implication on the energy policy as 
enumerated and discussed below.
Electricity Industry Policy provides for inter-alia, the promotion of competition within 
the electricity industry. This Policy is operative for a period of only three years (2011-2014) 
and is overdue for a review. At this juncture we hope to introduce two new policies; the 
Renewable Energy Policy and Rural Electrification Policy which are being funded by the World 
Bank.
The Oil and Gas Act 1996 was enacted to regulate the negotiation and conclusion by the 
Government on petroleum agreements relating to the exploration, development, production 
and transportation of petroleum.
Geothermal Energy Policy provides the framework for the usage and regulation of geothermal 
resources use when it concerns electricity generation from heat and steam.
Mining Act 1992 was enacted to regulate the exploration, development, production and 
transportation of minerals excluding petroleum.
The Mineral Resources Authority was established by an Act of Parliament in 2005 and is 
responsible for the management, exploration and development of Papua New Guinea’s 
mineral resources, including safety in mining operations.
The ICCC Act 2002 establishes the regime for consumer protection, promoting and protection 
of competition and regulating of State Owned Monopolies.
Alongside the foregoing principal Acts, there are several other Acts that impact the energy 
sector, including:-
The National Institute of Standards and Industrial Technology Act 1993 provides for 
establishment of minimum quality specifications, mode, materials and apparatus for energy 
use in the country. Also sets standards for storage tanks and dispensing equipment 
for sale of petroleum products and calibrates and regulates them for accuracy.
The Environment Act 2000 - provides for the regulation of all environmental related 
matters across industries.
The Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Government and the National 
Capital District Commission Act 2001 - grants authority for approval by local 
authorities of sites for construction and installation of fuel storage and dispensing 
facilities; business licensing and levies for electric power poles and way leaves 
charges.
The Physical Planning Act 1989 provides for zoning of areas for storage, distribution 
and retailing of petroleum fuels and construction of electric power sub-stations and 
other infrastructure.

72.4 CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
2.4.1 INSTITUTIONS
There are numerous institutional arrangements for the PNG energy sector. The policy 
functions for this sector largely come under the Department of Petroleum and Energy, 
Department of Prime Minister and National Executive Council, Department of Treasury, 
Department of National Planning and Monitoring, except for Geothermal and Coal which 
come under Department of Mineral Policy and Geo-Hazards Management (DMP&GHM).
The regulatory functions of the energy sector are currently fragmented and vested in 
different agencies including ICCC, PNG Power Limited and Department of Petroleum and 
Energy as well as Kumul Consolidated Holdings Limited in relation to PNG Power Limited 
project approvals.
The mandated functions of each institution dealing with the energy sector are briefly 
discussed below:
The Department of Petroleum and Energy was established to promote and regulate the 
development of petroleum and renewable sources of energy for the long term benefits of the 
State in a way which is ethical, socially responsible and environmentally sound. 
Due to capacity challenges the technical regulation for the electricity industry is yet to be 
transferred from Independent Consumer Competition Commission (ICCC) to the Department.
There is a proposal for the technical and economic regulation to be transferred to the 
proposed Energy Regulatory Commission (ENERCOM) to be housed under the proposed 
National Energy Authority (NEA). In addition, the electricity industry standards currently 
under National Institute of Standards and Industrial Technology (NISIT) is proposed to be

4 The Institutional arrangements of the energy sector will be streamlined to encourage 
efficiency, access and affordability. The energy regulatory functions both technical as well as 
economic will be brought under a new structure as detailed in chapter 13, specifically under 
the proposed Electricity Regulatory Commission (ENERCOM) which will perform this role. 3.1 BACKGROUND
3.2 UPSTREAM PETROLEUM
Fossil fuel consists of petroleum (oil, and natural gas) and coal resources. As at 2014 petroleum 
accounts for about 57% of the total primary energy consumed in the country. Petroleum is mainly 
used in transport, power generation, commercial and industrial sectors as well as households. 
There is no coal usage in the country.
The petroleum industry is broadly divided into three categories namely: upstream (exploration 
and production), mid-stream (storage, refining and transportation) and down-stream (supply and 
distribution). Midstream and downstream operations are sometimes combined.
The monetization of natural gas is more complex than the commercialization of liquid hydrocarbons. 
Substantial investments will be required in interrelated links in the supply chain including 
upstream, midstream, downstream and consumption facilities.

3.2.1 Petroleum Exploration & Production
PNG has benefited profoundly through significant foreign investment in its upstream 
petroleum exploration sector over the last 30 years where some of the players are leading 
international oil companies.
Production from existing oil fields reached their peak plateau more than 10 years ago. 
Production has been in steady decline.
Currently there are accelerated exploration activities undertaken in the country and the 
prospect of new oil and gas discoveries appears promising. The marked increase in 
petroleum exploration interest is attributed to;
Existence of an attractive legal, regulatory framework, fiscal and acceptable risk-reward 
balance incentive;
Intensive promotion activities by the Government; and
Rising world crude oil prices.
PNG’s geological prospective.

PNG commissioned its first commercial gas project in 1991. Oil Search owns and 
operates a gas powered generation plant at Hides and supplies electricity to Porgera 
Gold Mine. That power generation plant delivers electricity for Porgera Gold Mine. Its 
major export-based gas project was the US$ 19 Billion PNG LNG Project which was 
flliid i2014

FOSSIL FUELS 35 As at 2014, Papua New Guinea’s Petroleum Projects are shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Petroleum Projects, 2014
There are many undeveloped gas fields in the country with proven and probable reserves of 
over 20 trillion cubic feet of gas. Most of these discoveries are small to medium size fields.
As of May 2014, Papua New Guinea joined the exclusive club of LNG producers and 
exporters. With increased petroleum exploration being undertaken both on-shore and 
off-shore in the country’s major sedimentary basins there is now the possibility that more 
reserves of natural gas would be discovered in commercial quantities. The Government will 
ensure 15% of gas reserves in new Oil and Gas projects should be made available for 
domestic gas utilization.
The PNG economy is comparatively very small. Gas is a very versatile and environmentally 
friendly fuel. The PNG Government is not too unreasonable. PNG needs gas for power 
generation and requirement for such needs is not even 500 BCF or 1TCF of gas. There 
should be no panic questionining the State when the Government is simply saying that the host 
country needs a tiny volume of gas for domestic purposes, especially power generation and 
also the creation of Petrochemical Industry.
The Government recognises the significance of the industry and is determined to promote 
efficiency in the overall administration and regulation of the hydrocarbon industry.

Source: PNG Chamber of Mines and Petroleum, 20133.2.2 Challenges in Petroleum Upstream
There are several challenges in the petroleum sector and these are:
Current and emerging issues requiring resolution and certainty in the petroleum and 
energy industry include:
1
2
Attraction of capital for petroleum exploration and production activities, which are 
highly capital intensive due to the rugged geography.
Geological complexity.
High cost of acquisition of new technology.
Limited primary technical data in most of the country’s exploration blocks.
Low oil prices that are creeping closer to the cost of production per barrel of oil 
equivalent.
Declining gas, especially oil reserves because petroleum resources is finite.
Small and stranded gas fields requiring infrastructure to develop.
Fluctuating oil and gas prices affecting revenues and energy use in PNG.
Non availability of crude oil and gas for downstream processing, including for
petrochemical projects
Cycle time for licence applications averaging 300 days.
Licensing rounds.
Community awareness and participation.
Windfall profits in high oil price environments.
Gas sharing terms.
Environmental protection, conservation and management.
Mechanism for working out National Government, Provincial Government and Local 
Level Government benefits sharing and the ongoing management of those cash 
and non-cash benefit streams.
Payment of royalty on gross oil produced.
National Content in Project Development.
Domestic Market Obligation.
Third Party Access Regime.
Tax Review Committee deliberations on the petroleum industry fiscal regime and 
Licensing and regulatory regime for energy sector.

l]Petroleum and gas resources are finite.
Inadequate policy for sustainable utilization of petroleum revenue and its management.
The lower wellhead price of natural gas is caused either by having to compete with lower cost 
alternative fuels in the domestic market or as a result of lower netback prices into the export 
markets and longer project lead times which makes it extremely challenging to economically 
develop a natural gas industry based on oil-based fiscal terms.
High cost of gas transportation infrastructure to support gas discovery and development both 
offshore and onshore.
Inability to disaggregate into component elements of supply chain e.g. cost of wholesale gas, 
transportation and distribution in order to price the gas.
Lack of Gas Master Plan and Strategy.
Necessary amendments to be made to the existing legislations (especially Oil and Gas Act 
and the ICCC Act) governing hydrocarbons to ensure that no vertical integration takes place 
in the investment, extraction, processing distribution and transportation of hydrocarbons for 
all new Petroleum projects.
Establish a petroleum upstream licensing entity to be known as the Petroleum Resource 
Authority following the separation of petroleum and energy functions due to the separation of 
the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy.
Develop a policy on management of commercial discoveries of petroleum resources.
Actively promote investment in exploration activity.
Introduce model Production Sharing Contracts (PSC).
Continuation of petroleum and gas agreements but with fiscal terms taken out and included 
in the general legislation.
Cash bidding for the unallocated, relinquished and surrendered exploration acreage.
Contracting out of early stage geological survey work, financed out of proceeds of cash 
bidding for exploration acreage or through permits for scientific investigation.
Review the Oil & Gas Act 1998 (OGA 1998) to incorporate industry best practice adapted to 
fit local conditions. The revised Act shall provide for gas sharing terms, compensation, 
windfall profits, royalties and Corporate Social Responsibility, licensing rounds; community 
awareness and participation; windfall profits; bonuses as may be applicable; government

3.2.3 Policies and Strategies - Petroleum Upstreamshare out of monetary gains, environmental protection; conservation and management; 
sharing of benefits mechanism between the National, Provincial and Local Level Governments 
and local community; payment of royalty on gross oil produced; local content requirement. The 
revised Act will cover new entrant into the Petroleum sector and not those existing players 
operating under the current regime.
Develop mechanisms for sharing and management of petroleum benefits in line with the 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
Strengthen monetary and fiscal regimes to maximize the Government’s take on petroleum 
exploration while taking into account the investors’ interests.
Provide incentives for investments in marginal oil and gas discoveries that could have the 
potential to deliver much financial and socio- economic value.
Develop Local Content Policy that covers technology and knowledge transfer, capacity building 
of local industry and local employment opportunities as well as laws and regulations to govern 
local content implementation.
Ensure that petroleum exploration and production activities shall include technology transfer 
and development of local manpower including engaging qualified local personnel as a priority.
Enhance manpower and technical capacity in petroleum exploration by establishing 
programmes in conjunction with local industry associations, local and international training 
institutions.
Support local investors that have the financial capacity and interest to participate in and/or 
undertake petroleum exploration and production.
Support collaboration and synergy by government owned agencies keen to participate in 
petroleum exploration and production.
Develop oil and gas infrastructure such as crude oil pipelines and storage tanks through PPP 
and JV arrangements where appropriate.
Develop a comprehensive Oil & Gas Master Plan; promote the intensification of exploration 
activities; enhance the utilisation of local capacity in oil exploration; upgrade local access to 
cutting edge’ exploration technology; commence commercial production of petroleum.
To facilitate efficient use of capital and Government oversight a segmented fiscal structure 
covering the upstream, midstream and downstream shall be adopted. The upstream shall be 
subject to the proposed PSC regime while the midstream and downstream activities shall be 
held in separate entities outside the PSC and subject to the ITA 1959 on corporate taxation
governance principles.

3.3.2 Petroleum Supply and Distribution
3.3.3 Petroleum Infrastructure Issues
3.3 MIDSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM PETROLEUM
Provide mechanisms for commercialization of gas taking into account elements of supply 
chain which shall consider the value of natural gas upon discovery, development, processing 
and the market for end products in order to determine the pricing.
Undertake measures to fast track commercial gas discovery including CBM and Shale Gas.
In the event of discovery of crude oil together with natural gas, companies should endeavour 
to ensure that secondary measures are instituted to exhaustively produce from such wells.
Flaring of natural gas must be regulated by way of formulating a gas flaring policy and regulation.
Offer more favourable fiscal terms for natural gas including more favourable profit splits 
as an incentive for natural gas exploration and development.
The average consumption of petroleum products in Papua New Guinea has been increasing 
over the years. Some of the factors that explain this increase in consumption include GDP 
growth, electrical energy demand, population growth, urban population growth and increase 
in motorization and air transport.
Demand for petroleum products is projected to rise in line with the boom in economic activities 
triggered by the PNG LNG project. 
The world economy emerged from the recession experienced in 2009 recording a significant 
growth of 4.6% in 2010. This influenced world oil demand and supply.
In 2011 oil prices fluctuated rapidly with the lowest at US$ 95.60 per barrel in January, peaking 
in April at US$ 120 per barrel and averaging at more than US$110 per barrel most of the year. 
In 2012 the average oil price went up by 3.1% to US$112.97 per barrel.
The rapid prices changes were mainly attributed to strong global demand, appreciation of the 
dollar and the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. High international oil prices in the 
past and a weak PNG Kina have led to spikes in prices of petroleum products in the domestic market.
Sufficient and efficient infrastructural systems are key to ensuring adequate, reliable and cost 
effective production and supply of petroleum products. The increase in local and regional 
demand for petroleum products has not been matched by the development of the infrastructure to 
meet supply chain and market demands.
In addition, the volatile international prices of petroleum products and the volatile foreign 
echange rates hae led to npredictable consmer pricesmore so in the local pmp prices

3.3.4.1 Storage Facilities at Napa Napa
3.3.6.1 Pipeline
3.3.4.2 Strategic Petroleum Reserves
PNG’s only oil refinery, the Napa Napa oil refinery located outside of Port Moresby has a 
processing capacity of about 36,000 barrels a day. By industry standards, this is a very 
small refinery. The refinery currently imports both crude oil and refined petroleum products. 
Currently the refinery is not operational.
The State would like to encourage competition in the petroleum fuels market, hence competition 
in the entire value chain of the fuels market from refinery to retailing will be promoted.
The State shall use its best endeavours to secure domestically produced crude at Kina 
price as feedstock to transfer cost benefits to the national economy.
The Puma Energy - owned Napa Napa Oil refinery was at one stage refining 36,000 bpd 
of crude oil. The refinery produces Jet A-1, diesel and gasoline. The State is determined to 
encourage competition in the oil refinery sector in order to achieve efficiency and low unit 
cost of production, which should be transferred to the end users and this is fundamentally 
crucial for the Government in growing the national economy. Currently the refinery is not
operational.
The State would encourage local refineries to purchase domestically produced crude and 
that the price of feedstock crude shall be equivalent to cost of production and transportation 
plus a 10 percent margin.
Napa Napa has a storage capacity of 750,000 barrels of crude feedstock and approximately 
1.1 million barrels of refined products while its operational capacity is 35,000 bpd. This 
comprises Jet A1, diesel and gasoline. This capacity is adequate for domestic demand of 
petroleum products but the refinery currently imports some refined petroleum products as 
it often produces at below capacity. Currently the refinery is not operational.
Oil and Gas pipelines as well as processing and storage facilities are very important national 
infrastructures.
The Oil and Gas Act 1998 provides for Third Party Access in major oil and gas 
pipelines, particularly pipelines which have a capacity of 30 inches and over, hence a 
project developer must make provision for excess capacity to be made available in the 
The State recognizes the critical need to put in place energy security mechanisms, 
particularly with respect to refined fuels and therefore will address issues pertaining to 
feedstock, refinery capacity, storage and efficiency.

PNG’s LNG sector has a huge potential for expansion and the Government’s desire is to 
maximise PNG’s benefits by encouraging State Owned Companies and Nationally Owned 
Companies to participate in each segment of the LNG value chain including LNG tankers.
Being a marine nation, sea transport is a vital part of life in PNG and the Government’s desire 
is to create an environment where the cost structure of business in PNG is reduced including 
the cost of sea transportation.
Road transport will continue to play a vital role in the distribution of petroleum refined fuels in 
PNG and the Government recognizes the importance of making transportation less costly by 
addressing elements which add to increased cost of business such as bad roads and high 
cost of fuel.

3.3.7 Oil Marketing Companies (OMC)
Puma Energy, since taking over InterOil’s refining assets in Papua New Guinea is the major 
licensed OMC allowed to import and market crude and petroleum products in Papua New 
Guinea. There are two more OMCs in the market, Niugini Oil Company and Mobil Oil 
Limited and now Total.
InterOil retail and wholesale distribution business distributes diesel, jet fuel, gasoline, 
kerosene and fuel oil as well as Shell and BP branded commercial and industrial lubricants 
such as engine and hydraulic oils.
Mobil, Puma and Total own and operate large terminals and depots throughout Papua New 
Guinea. InterOil supplies Jet A1 fuel to Aviation companies.
In addition to their wholesale distribution networks, both Mobil and InterOil run retail service 
stations networks throughout the country.
Puma owns eleven (11) airfield operations in Papua New Guinea located on or adjacent 
to selected airports/airstrips. Customers include the following; the National Government 
carrier, commercial passenger airlines, mining and exploration and independent airline 
operators.
The current Service Agreement between Puma Energy and GoPNG is under review to 
allow in additional competitors.
The Government endeavours to create a level playing field for OMCs to compete fairly so 
that the market forces of supply and demand will set the true economic price for refined 
petroleum products.

73.3.8 Regulated Industry/Regulatory Contracts
3.3.9 Global Geo - Political Issues
3.3.10 Challenges in the Mid and Downstream Petroleum
The retailed petroleum refined fuels market is regulated but there are imbalances in the 
market, hence making the cost of fuel in PNG very expensive.
The Government is determined to ensure the market is regulated properly in a manner 
where the suppliers are able to make a reasonable return on their investment while the 
consumers in PNG including ordinary citizens and SMEs benefit from low unit cost of fuels.
On the international scene, crude oil prices have been on a continuous and gradual 
increase before plunging in July 2014. There are a number of geo-political issues that affect 
the oil prices in the international scene not only in recent years but also in the past. The 
recent plummeting in crude oil prices are in one way or another influenced by factors or 
events such as a slowdown in China’s economy, the unrest in the Middle East, the lifting of
economic sanctions over Iran, reduction in production by OPEC, piracy in the Indian Ocean, 
increased tension between the USA and Russia over the Ukrainian/Russian conflict, 
increased demand for petroleum products worldwide, foreign exchange fluctuations and 
fluctuations in the USA strategic reserves.
This fluctuation of the international prices has caused shocks to domestic petroleum prices.
Imported petroleum products are paid for in US Dollars. Fluctuation of the exchange rate 
against the US Dollar shows an overall gradual depreciation. The depreciation of the Papua 
New Guinea Kina against US Dollar negates any drop in international crude oil prices and 
makes imports more expensive.
Other major costs that impact consumer prices are taxes and levies on petroleum products.
Other costs which have increased are the transportation and distribution costs and the 
allowed marketer’s margin to cover overheads and profit.

203.4 MID AND DOWNSTREAM NATURAL GAS
Natural gas has the potential of meeting future energy needs of the country and offers 
a number of significant environmental benefits over other fossil fuels mainly due to its 
chemical simplicity that burns cleaner than all other fossil fuels.
The country could harness some of the indigenous gas to meet the growing energy requirements 
of the country and would seek to reduce reliance on imports.
The monetization of natural gas especially in marketing and distribution is frequently more 
complex than the commercialization of hydrocarbon liquid reserves as demonstrated in the 
PNG LNG Project. Frequently, investments will be required in interrelated links in the supply 
chain including upstream, midstream, downstream and consumption facilities.
Electric Power Generation: The main use of natural gas is through gas-fired power 
generation, preferably Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) to ensure maximum efficiency. 
Generation of power through gas fired plants have several advantages over other fossil fuelled 
power plants in that they have much lower environmental impact. Natural gas pipelines 
would need to be constructed from the field to the power plant or from the LNG processing 
facilities or import pipeline (should one ever be required).
Industrial: The following industries are potentially economically feasible when sufficient 
quantities of natural gas are available at reasonable cost (after considering the import 
parity price of end-product concerned).
Gas to Liquids: This application is used to produce diesel and other fuels. However the 
technology for Gas to Liquids (GTL) has not yet been commercially proven and therefore 
shall not be an option until such technologies are well developed and available at reasonable 
cost.
Transport: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is methane pressured at 200 to 250 bars (2900

shall be applied in PNG for transport where economic relative to alternatives.
Commercial and domestic use: The Government shall initiate pilot projects for residential 
domestic and commercial purposes for space heating, water heating, cooking, and street 
lighting. Networks shall be developed for supplying residential and commercial consumers 
with clean and reliable natural gas.
Lack of economic, legal, regulatory and fiscal framework to facilitate the export options as the 
easiest and quickest option to monetize natural gas discoveries.
Lack of facilities that are economic to exploit natural gas reserves e.g. power plants, 
petrochemical plants and fertilizer plants.
Lack of infrastructure for supply to commercial, industrial and residential consumers.
Lack of a Gas Master Plan.
Necessary amendments to be made to the existing legislations (especially Oil and Gas Act 
and the ICCC Act) governing hydrocarbons to ensure that no vertical integration takes place 
in the investment, extraction, distribution and transportation of hydrocarbons for all new 
petroleum projects.
Develop a Gas Master Plan and policy that identifies priority domestic sectors for gas 
utilization, provided sufficient volumes are discovered. This will allow gas to be separated 
and exported at international market prices.
Develop a Standard Gas Project Agreement template.
Develop the gas sector by: ensuring the safe supply of gas to end users; attracting investment 
in the sector by establishing a transparent and efficient legislative framework; promoting 
private sector participation in all parts of the gas value chain and establishing a regulatory framework 
on Economic Regulation, Negotiated Access and Operational Regulation according to international 
norms.

Coal is a combustible rock containing more than 50% by weight and more than 70% by 
volume of carbonaceous material formed from compaction of variously altered plant remains. 
It is used as a source of energy mainly for electricity generation. It is amongst the 
most affordable fuel worldwide and has a potential to become the most reliable and easily 
accessible energy source. However, the true cost is not known until transport and processing 
economics (to the end market) have been assessed relative to alternative sources of fuel.
The introduction of Clean Coal Technology (CCT) in ‘coal fired’ power plants reduces 
emissions and extracts sulphur for other applications such as chemical and fertilizer production 
while capturing carbon for storage (CCS). However, this may still be substantially higher than 
alternatives. Current world coal energy consumption by sector is 42% electricity, 25% industrial 
and 4% other uses.
The country has adequate coal deposits for commercial exploration and the Government is 
fast tracking exploration, economic assessment and development of the resource for potential 
power generation and industrial use.
Interest in coal has also increased recently in PNG with prospectors securing dozens of new 
coal exploration permits starting in early 2011. Australian based Waterford is investigating 
coal shale long the Sepik and the Ramu basin in the northeast of the country, while other 
attention has also been shown in the Gulf basin in the southwest. Having completed initial 
exploratory efforts, the results are now being analysed and expected to be submitted to the 
Mineral Resources Authority (MRA) by mid 2012.
Since PNG is a signatory to the COP 21 Agreement, consideration on the use of coal as a 
source of energy to generate electricity is considered with caution. However, with technological 
advancement, clean coal will be considered for base load power to support projects of national 
significance that have large power requirement.

3.5 CLEAN COAL RESOURCES
3.5.1 OverviewIn Papua New Guinea, there is a demand for coal for cheap and alternative electricity 
generation. Clean coal has been considered an alternative option for base-load electricity 
generation in PNG and thus its domestic demand may be expected to rise with introduction 
of the technology, subject to cost competiveness versus other fuel sources and after factoring 
in transport and conversion costs.
Domestic consumption is expected with the discovery of coal deposits by Mayur Resources3, 
in the Gulf Province and other parts of the country.
Global demand for coal is also challenged. 
There are potentially commercially viable coal reserves in the Gulf Province.
Coal reserves there are yet to be confirmed.
Further exploration for coal is being carried out in other parts of the country.
Limited skills and expertise in core drilling disciplines.
Limited coal reserve data due to low intensity of exploration.
Poor infrastructure; coal resources are mostly situated in remote areas where there is lack of 
developed road, water, communication and electricity.
Lack of interest by major coal exploration companies due to limited technical data.
Absence of a legal, fiscal and regulatory framework for coal exploration, exploitation and 
development.
Lack of a special purpose vehicle to spearhead exploration, assessment and development of 
coal resources.
There are no coal fired power plants in PNG as yet.
The Government will encourage clean-energy technology for the development and consumption 
of coal in the country.

54.1 BACKGROUND 
PNG is endowed with abundant renewable energy resources. Over 80% of the country’s population 
is without access to electricity. Out of the 80%, only 7% are within 1km radius of the grid. Given 
the topography and settlement patterns of people, 75% of the population will be electrified by grid 
and 25% by off-grid electrification through National Electricity Roll Out Plan (NEROP). PNG has 
significant underutilized indigenous energy sources such hydro, biomass, natural gas, geothermal, 
solar-based systems and wind. Development of these resources would accelerate PNG’s potential 
to enhance electrification rate, energy production and export (where possible) and sustain 
economic growth.
Renewable energy is a naturally occurring non-depletable sources of energy such as hydro, 
solar, wind, geothermal, tidal wave, ocean current, biofuel and biomass to produce electricity, 
gases and liquid fuels, heat or a combination of these energy types. Some of these renewable 
energies such as wind and biomass have been used for thousands of years.
Current consumer energy in PNG mostly depends on three main fuels; hydro, oil and biomass. In 
terms of primary energy supply in 2011 oil products accounted for approximately 57%, biomass 
37% and hydro, gas and geothermal power the remaining 6%. The energy sector accounts for 14% 
of the country’s GDP.
With the developments of renewable energy technologies, these renewable energy sources can 
be used to generate electricity. Taking into account the sustainable character of the majority of 
renewable energy technologies, they are able to improve use of these resources, promote energy 
security and diversify energy supply with minimum environmental impact.
PNG is a net oil importer but there is considerable potential over the medium term for reduction 
in oil imports. The development of the renewable energy sector requires investment to reshape 
the future energy mix, reduce the current volume of oil imports and address energy security. For 
instance, adequate investment in hydro power with potential of 15,000 MW of electricity will 
significantly address the energy needs of PNG. This requires significant policy interventions and 
specialized business entities focusing on renewable energy to materialize the dreams of the Vision 
2050 relating to energy.
Policy interventions, increased investment, specialised business entities and appropriate technologies 
are needed to harness renewable energy sources to accelerate electrification in off grid and rural areas.
The PNG Vision 2050 asserts that by the year 2050 PNG will be 100% powered by renewable 
energy sources at the backdrop of our aspirational policy. PNG is at the crossroads and must now 
more than ever promote and develop our natural energy resources towards sustainable economic growth.
Major energy impact projects have played a significant role in the development of nations both in terms 
of domestic energy needs and export of energy. In terms of energy exports there will be concerted

RENEWABLE ENERGY 4explore other future arrangement for export of excess energy. For example, the proposed Purari 
Hydropower is a major impact project and when developed will produce least cost energy to drive 
industrial growth in the country with excess power exported to neighbouring countries.
The strategy under this policy is to identify and develop other major impact energy projects throughout 
the country. One of the roles of the National Energy Authority (NEA) to be established through this 
policy will be to oversee feasibility studies and implementation of major energy projects.
Appropriate institutions will be established under the policy to develop specific energy sources in 
line with commercial best practices.
The delivery of major energy projects will require concerted multi-agency approach in supporting 
and providing necessary approvals to avoid lengthy and costly delays currently experienced by 
major project developers and investors.
The technical feasibility studies identified Wabo as the preferred site for the construction of a dam 
with a capacity to produce up to 2,500 MW of power. This level of generation has the potential to 
propel industrial development in PNG, supply consumers in Port Moresby and the Ramu power 
systems as well as the potential to export excess power to Australia and Indonesia. However, it 
might be the most expensive project ever undertaken in PNG and large scale hydro is seldom seen 
as renewable, given resulting long term methane emissions from flooded and rotting vegetation.
The State should be actively involved in the development of renewable energy resource for the 
following reasons:
State commercial participation in the development of renewable energy projects. The level of State 
participation:
The launch of the National Biofuel Policy Consultation Workshop in 2014 and the drive to develop 
a Biofuel Policy by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) is also a step in the right direction 
to meaningfully utilise PNG’s renewable energy resources under the auspices of the government’s 
‘Green Growth Strategy’. The Workshop findings revealed that the growth of biofuels in PNG in 
recent years has been spurred by increasing prices of fossil fuels, the need to survive financially 
in business, environmental concerns and unreliable supply of energy. Biofuels are also viewed as 
a potential means to stimulate rural development and create employment opportunities. The thrust
of the Biofuel Policy would be to facilitate and bring about optimal development and utilization of 
indigenous biomass feedstock for production of biofuels
To ensure the achievement of the Vision 2050 goal of 100% electricity access to all consumers.
To ensure that there are adequate returns on investment from renewable energy projects.
To ensure investment in renewable energy projects benefit the country as well as the resource 
owners equitably.
Up to 10 MW is reserved for State investment including National Government, Provincial 
Governments, LLGs and landowners.
Beyond 10 MW the State has the option to participate ranging from 20 - 40 percent.

Below the earth’s crust there is a layer of hot and molten rock called magma. Heat is 
continually produced mostly from the decay of naturally radioactive materials such as uranium 
and potassium. The amount of heat within 10,000 metres of the earth’s surface contains 
50,000 times more energy than all the oil and natural gas resources in the world. Four 
types of geothermal energy are usually distinguished:
The areas with the highest underground temperatures are in regions with active or geological 
young volcanoes. These occur at plate boundaries or at places where the crust is thin enough 
to let the heat through.
Papua New Guinea is situated on the “Pacific Ring of Fire”, a seismically active zone. Known 
seismic active zones are in the New Guinea Islands Region and the Northern Coast of the 
Mainland. The Gazelle Peninsula and Talasea are known areas for geothermal activity. 
Incidentally they also contain viable commercial quantities of geothermal energy reserves.
The only commercially known use of this energy source in the country is on Lihir Island where 
a plant uses the energy to supply power to the mining operations at the Lihir Gold Mine. 
However, this resource is seen as declining and increasingly unreliable for baseload generation.
Geothermal power plants use steam or hot water from a natural underground reservoir to 
generate electrical energy and heat for other industrial applications. Other uses of geothermal 
energy include:
Currently, hydrothermal resources are used on a commercial scale for electricity generation and 
as a direct heat source.

4.3.2 LARGE HYDROS
4.3.3 Background
4.3 HYDRO ENERGY
Hydro power is electricity generated using the energy of moving water. Rain or melted snow, 
usually originating in hills and mountains create streams and rivers that eventually run to 
lakes, seas or oceans. This energy has been used for centuries. In the late 19th century 
hydro power became a source for generating electricity.
A typical hydro plant is a system with three parts: an electric plant where the electricity is 
produced; a dam that can be opened or closed to control water flow; and a reservoir where 
water can be stored. The amount of electricity that can be generated depends on how far the 
water drops and how much water moves through the system.
Hydro power is, to date, the most successful form of renewable energy. The amount of 
electrical energy generated depends upon the quantity of available water. Adverse hydrology 
can have a devastating effect on an economy that is heavily dependent on hydropower.
Papua New Guinea has an estimated hydropower potential of about 15,000 MW comprising 
large hydros (sites with capacity of more than 10 MW) and small hydros, according to the 
Shawinigan Report of 1980.
There are four major hydro power stations in Papua New Guinea, namely: Rouna (Port 
Moresby), Yonki (Kainantu), Warangoi (Gazelle) and Baiune (Bulolo). These hydro power 
stations are critical to the country’s socio - economic wellbeing.
PNG has significant potential in large hydro based power generation, given its high rainfall and 
many large fast flowing rivers systems.
There are four (4) major Drainage Basins in the Country; the Strickland-Purari, Fly, Ramu and 
Sepik River Drainage Basins. The two promising ones for major hydro developments are the 
Ramu and Strickland-Purari due to their geography and volume.
Funding will be required for Government to undertake more feasibility studies to develop large 
hydros in the country.

34.3.4 Challenges
4.3.5 Strategies - Large Hydros
Hydropower is vulnerable to variations in geology, hydrology, climate and water turbidity (PNG 
rivers have one of the highest sediments load in the world contributing to turbine silting and 
high operations and maintenance costs). This is a big challenge as no rain results in power and 
energy shortfalls, reducing the contribution of hydro power in the energy mix.
The economic risk in hydropower projects is relatively higher than other modes of electricity 
generation because they are capital intensive (very high fixed costs, but low operating and 
maintenance costs) and wholly dependent on hydrology.
A major challenge for hydro power projects requiring dams is relocation and resettlement of 
affected persons given PNG’s customary land tenure arrangement.
Long lead time of construction between 7-10 years.
Insufficient geological and hydrological data throughout Papua New Guinea and does not 
capture quality nor cover required periods of at least 50 years.
Water charges that have an effect of increasing the cost of hydro generated electricity.
Conflicting and competing land and water uses between various sub-sectors of the economy 
with regard to development and utilization of the same for electricity generation.
 
Ownership of physical dam reservoirs which have stifled redevelopment.
Establish an inter-departmental committee comprising relevant stakeholders to draft a policy 
on large hydro development.
Energy conservation and efficiency will be promoted in the design of hydro power plants.
Environmental conservation of catchment areas will be promoted to mitigate soil erosion, high 
sediment loads and land use practices which do not aggravate the surface geology and top 
soil and cause rapid siltation of dams and river systems. The developer shall be responsible 
for funding the initiative. Where possible use other alternate hydro generation technologies.
The Government shall where possible implement hydro power projects as multi-purpose 
projects providing power and water needs of consumers. Consideration will also be given to 
leasing of such projects for operation through long-term concessions.
The private sector will be encouraged through Feed-in-Tariff to develop potential sites 
to generate electricity for their own consumption and for sate to the national grid and export.

54.3.6 Small Hydro Background
Classification of hydro by sizes (MW) varies in jurisdictions. Therefore, for our purposes, we 
categorise most hydro systems within Papua New Guinea to fall under the category of small 
hydro. Small hydro can range from generating capacity up to 10 MW.
PNG’s system comprise several small to medium scale hydro ranging from 0.8 MW to 58 MW. 
Tables 1 and 2 below shows existing and proposed hydro developments.
PNG has significant hydro electric potential with vast rivers, numerous creeks, streams and 
mountain spring water flows throughout the country that can be harnessed to produce 
hydro electricity power for the rural population of PNG.
The specific details of small hydro as a renewable energy resource will be captured in the

7Biomass is organic matter that can be used to provide heat, make fuel and generate electricity. 
Wood-fuel, the largest source of biomass has been used to provide heat for thousands of 
years. Many other types of biomass are also used as an energy source such as plant residue 
from agriculture or forestry and the organic component of municipal and industrial wastes or
newly planted environmentally friendly forest plantations. Landfill gas is also considered a 
biomass source. Biomass resources can be replenished through cultivation of crops such as 
fast growing trees and grass.
Biomass fuels are the most important source of primary and potentially secondary energy in 
Papua New Guinea with wood-fuel (firewood, crop residue and charcoal) being the predominant 
consumer energy fuel.
In spite of past efforts to promote wood fuel substitutes, the number of people relying on wood 
fuel is not decreasing. Consequently, wood fuel will continue to be the primary source of energy 
for the majority of the rural population and urban poor until affordable alternate sources of 
energy reduce dependence on firewood.
Wood fuel supply management is crucial to ensure sustainable supply to meet the growing 
demand. Key issues here include: competing land use activities, supply demand balance and 
the impact of any positive versus environmental impacts from poor management as well as 
related land and tree tenure issues.
The specific details of Biomass as a Renewable Energy resource will be captured in the 
Renewable Energy Policy to be developed by NEA.
Unsustainable use of biomass with attendant negative impacts on the environment can lead to 
local climate variability and unpredictability in rainfall patterns.
Emissions from wood fuel in poorly ventilated houses leading to health hazards among 
residential users.
Lack of public awareness on growing fast maturing tree for fuel as an environmentally and 
commercially viable business.
Inadequate data on biomass production and consumption.
Disjointed approach in policy implementation by the various ministries and organizations 
responsible for biomass energy use.

cooking, water heating and steam generation.
Undertake a comprehensive study with the view to eliminate use of kerosene in households.
Prepare, review and update biomass energy development plans.
Unlike other renewable sources, biomass can be blended into liquid fuels called biofuels to meet 
energy needs.
The use of biofuels in transportation would reduce vehicle emissions and save on foreign 
exchange required for importing petroleum fuel, improve on the balance of trade and create 
employment.
A strategy for introduction of biofuel blends in the market is being considered and soon to be 
developed by the NEA 4.
Commercial extraction of biodiesel for blending has already been initiated by several private 
companies and some institutions such as PAU and PNG Unitech in PNG.
Land will need to be set aside for the production of energy crops as feedstock for biofuels. This 
calls for the formulation of strategies to optimise land use, as well as to harmonise land use policies 
with the energy policy. Most biofuel projects underway or being planned involve sugarcane, 
cassava and sweet sorghum as the main feedstock for ethanol, jatropha, castor and other 
vegetable oil crops such as, coconut, palm oil, croton, peanut and cotton seed for biodiesel.
The specific details of a policy on Biofuels as a renewable energy source will be captured in the 
policy to be developed by NEA.
inadequate investment in development of biofuels projects.
Insufficient feed-stocks to continually produce biofuels.

Any gas fuel derived from the decay of organic matter such as the mixture of methane and carbon 
dioxide produced by the bacterial decomposition of sewage, manure, garbage and plant crops.
Biogas is considered to be a renewable source of energy. Since it is often produced from materials 
that form sewage and waste products, the only time it will be depleted is when we stop producing 
any waste.
It is also considered to be non-polluting in nature. The production of biogas does not require 
oxygen which means that resources are conserved by not using any further fuel. 
It also uses up waste material found In landfills, dump sites and even farms across the country.
Applications for biogas are increasing as the technology improves for its utilization. It can be used 
to produce electricity and for the purpose of heating and cooking as well. Compressed Natural 
Gas (CNG) is biogas that has been compressed and can be used as a fuel for vehicles. Production 
can be carried out through many small plants or one large plant.
New Britain Palm Oil Limited and the West New Britain Provincial Government have agreed that 
electricity generated from the company’s waste products across the New Britain Island.

Solar energy is the light and heat radiated from the sun that powers earth’s climate and supports 
life. Solar radiation often called the solar resource is a general term for the electromagnetic radiation 
emitted by the sun. Solar technologies allow control use of this energy resource. Solar radiation can 
be captured and turned into useful forms of energy such as electricity and heat using variety 
of technologies. Solar energy is among the largest potential renewable energy resource in 
Papua New Guinea due to its close proximity to the equator where the country experiences 
sunshine all year around.
Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels are the most common solution for harnessing the sun’s energy. 
The basic building block of a PV system is the solar cell. Thermal systems convert sunlight into 
thermal energy to produce electricity.
Solar PV has spread gradually in PNG over the past 30 years with small independent solar 
systems marketed by private suppliers and used mainly for lighting and also for communications. 
From 1998 - 2002 some 3000 solar home lighting systems were sold to individuals. The PNG 
Telecommunication Company (Telikom PNG) has large number of solar sites with a total capacity 
of over 200 kWp. The expansion of mobile phone system into rural areas is rapidly increasing solar 
use for telecommunication and increasing demand for solar powered phone chargers. A PGK 15 
million (about USD 11.3 million) Japanese-supported project provided solar electrification for 320 
schools in twenty (20) Provinces of the country from 1997 - 1998, however, by 2004 only a few 
of the panels installed were still operating (IRENA, 2013).
The PNG University of Technology (UNITECH) has supported small-scale applied research 
projects involving solar energy. The latest initiative is the Renewable Energy (Solar and Wind) 
Resource Mapping project aimed at determining the potential of solar and wind energy to 
support its development in various locations though out PNG for both utility-scale generation and 
for village power and other off-grid applications.
The specific details of Solar Energy as a Renewable Energy resource shall be captured in the 
Renewable Energy Policy to be developed by the NEA.

and standards to be developed as a matter of urgency.
Promote the use of solar and hybrid solar systems for domestic, commercial and industrial uses.
Provide incentives to promote the local production of solar and hybrid solar systems.
Provide a framework for connection of electricity generated from solar energy to national and 
particularly isolated grids or non-grid solutions through direct sale or net metering.

Encourage installation of solar PV systems in all public facilities and in the off grid areas.
The percentage of solar energy harnessed for commercial and domestic applications is insignificant 
relative to the potential due in part to its cost effectiveness and lack of storage technology in many 
applications.
Solar power systems are expensive and therefore favourable fiscal incentives and appropriate 
credit and financing mechanism to be supported by the Electricity Trust Fund and other funding 
sources.
Lack of regulations to address the issue of importation of sub-standard systems and follow up of 
after-sales service.
Rampant theft and vandalism of solar photovoltaic panels which discourages their installation.
Lack of awareness on the potential opportunities and economic benefits offered by solar 
technologies.

Wind energy uses naturally occurring energy of the wind for practical purposes like generating 
electricity, charging batteries and pumping water. Large modern wind turbines operate together 
in wind farms to produce electricity for utilities.
With the rising cost of oil, development of wind energy has become more attractive. Substitution 
of thermal generation with wind power plants will cut down on the large amounts of foreign 
exchange required to import fossil fuels for the thermal power plants.
Further, partial substitution or combining wind with gen-sets (wind-diesel hybrid) and some 
form of renewable energy storage such as pumped storage in hydropower could cut down on 
running or overall costs by substituting renewable energy sources for significant amounts of 
diesel.
Using wind energy to substitute thermal generation will also lead to less C02 emissions thus 
contributing to reduction in global warming. The carbon credits associated with the reduction of 
the emissions can be sold as certificates of emission reduction.
There is currently a lack of data on potential wind energy resources in the country. Usage of 
wind energy in the country is limited to pumping of water by windmills on cattle farms or for 
irrigation. Areas near the coast often experience a good steady flow of wind. The Markham 
Valley being the largest plain in the Morobe Province is a very ideal location and good area for 
development of wind farms as well as other valley systems in the country.

food scraps, yard waste and inorganic waste from homes, institutions and businesses. Also 
waste generated by manufacturing, agriculture, mining and construction and demolition debris, 
as well as sludge and liquid waste from water and waste water treatment facilities, septic tanks, 
sewerage systems and slaughter houses.
In order of preference municipal waste can be managed by reduction of its production at source. 
Reuse or recycling and treatment to destroy or reprocess waste to recover energy for other 
beneficial resources if the treatment does not threaten public health, safety, the environment or 
dumping and disposal.
Most of the municipal waste in PNG is disposed in poorly managed dump sites. With appropriate 
waste to energy technologies, municipal waste can be used to provide energy while helping to 
clean the environment.
The current upgrading of the Baruni Waste Dump in the National Capital District funded by the 
Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) using the Fukuoka Method can be utilised to 
produce Biogas for commercial use.
The specific details of Municipal Waste as a Renewable Energy resource will be captured in the

4.9.2 Challenges
4.9.3 Strategies - Municipal WasteCo-generation refers to the simultaneous production of heat and power from one single fuel 
source. It is common where plant processes require both heat and power such as sugar 
processing and offers opportunity for improved plant energy efficiency besides reducing energy 
costs and providing additional revenue stream through surplus power export to the national grid.
The co-generation industry is one of the more advanced industries around the world, particularly 
with Biomass. Bagasse (Sugarcane by-product) is only one potential form of co-generation fuel. 
Others available in PNG include sustainable wood and other fibres. Technical capacity for 
biomass co-generation should be understood and deployed.
Inadequate technical capacity in commercial and emerging co-generation technologies.
Lack of awareness in co-generation potential in areas where the agro-waste is available.

4.10.1 Background
4.10.2 Challenges
4.10.3 Strategies - Biomass Co-generationA waste heat recovery system is an energy recovery heat exchanger that recovers heat energy 
from hot streams with potential high energy content such as hot flue gases from diesel generation or steam from cooling towers or even from waste water from different cooling processes 
such as hot steel cooling.
A good example of recovered energy generation is the ORMAT’s organic rankine cycle. ORMAT 
recovered energy generation power plants expertise is based on the ORMAT energy converter 
(OEC). The OEC is based on a thermodynamics process that transfers heat to an organic motive 
fluid that is vaporized. This fluid has a lower boiling point therefore vaporizes faster. The expansion 
pressure inside a vapour turbine drives a generator or an additional compressor coupled to the unit.
The electricity generation is known as co-generation where the fuel is burnt and the exhaust 
gases are than piped to recover the heat which is later used to drive another turbine to produce 
electricity. The recovered energy power plants are environmentally safer and more efficient.
Recovered energy also applies to hydrocarbon fuel sources.
Encourage investment in power generation to meet the increasing demand for electricity.
Reduce transaction and administrative costs and delays by eliminating the conventional 
bidding process.
Provide a reasonable rate of return to I PP’s investors as an incentive to be involved in power 
generation.

purchase.
No clear guidelines on PPA negotiations which results in lengthy negotiations. 
A Feed in Tariff (FiT) is an instrument of promoting electricity generation from renewable energy 
sources. It is also an instrument used to charge tariff for non-renewable energy source 
generation. It enables power producers to generate and sell Renewable Energy Sources Generated 
Electricity (RES-E) to a distributor at a pre-determined fixed tariff for a given period of time.
The objectives of the FiT Policy are to:

Other renewable energy sources and technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or commercialised. 
These include ocean energy, biomass gasification, bio-refinery technologies and concentrating 
solar power. Particularly, a subject of interest is ocean energy owing to the coastline of Papua 
New Guinea. 
The oceans contain huge amounts of power that can be drawn from different technologies and 
harnessed for generating useful energy. The most developed conversion systems use tidal energy, 
thermal energy, ocean currents and waves.
Fast-flowing ocean currents between Sohano and Buka passage in North Bougainville can be 
harnessed as well as other coastal areas of extreme differences in high tides and low tides.

9Road transportation is a very important mode of transportation and a very reliable medium for 
the delivery of goods and services in PNG. The Government would like to see this sector grow 
and significant capital investments have been already made in road construction and more funds
will be injected into this vital sector of the economy.
Diesel and petrol are the two main fuel types used widely in the country together with lubricants. 
Prices for these fuels are amongst the highest in the region and the world. The Government 
would address high fuel cost concerns by encouraging competition in the market including 
encouraging investments in new oil refineries.
The cost of fuel and basic goods and services in areas located far from the main cities and towns 
are even far higher because of the associated cost involved with long distances. The Government 
will open up many new roads and focus on building a modern road network that provides the 
catalyst for economic growth.
It is of significant national interest that the transportation fuels sector is regulated in a manner that is 
efficient and environmentally sound while at the same time security of supply is adequately managed 
through appropriate mechanisms. The Government understands the inherent need to better regulate 
this sector as the national economy cannot progress without the fuels sector performing efficiently.
What is principally important to the Government is that the provision of fuels in the country is affordable, 
accessible, and reliable. Most importantly, fuels sold in PNG must meet quality and environmental 
standards and the Government would make sure appropriate standards and regulations are put in 
place to better regulate the sector.
This policy supports the PNG National Transport Strategy (NTS) for the use of sustainable energy 
through encouraging the following measures;

5.1 BACKGROUND
5.1.1 Land Transportation Fuels
The introduction of fuel-efficient transport and engines that are able to operate on biofuels.
Domestic biodiesel and bioethanol for the transport sector.
The operation and maintenance of equipment in a manner that minimizes consumption and 
emission of carbon dioxide emissions; and
The use of vehicle fleet-weighted against the fuel and emissions efficiency, ascertained from 
annual report.

c]
d]
TRANSPORTATION FUELS 5The Government will strongly push for the development and use of alternative clean fuels to 
replace high pollutant fuels like diesel and petrol. Natural gas in the form of Compressed Natural 
Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) are such fuels that will be seriously assessed for 
use in the future for the transport sector. Other fuels like solar and hydrogen will be also considered 
for research and trials as well for use in the road transportation sector.
The rapid development of electric and hybrid vehicles as well as trains are now on the market and 
could be an option the Government can consider now and in the future.
Specific regulations will be formulated to also control noise and air pollution from the production 
and use of fuels. These regulations will also cover the production and use of petrochemicals.
4
5
6
Marine transportation is also very crucial for coastal villages and towns as well as for all other 
economic and commercial activities. The current high cost of fuel is a concern to the Government 
because businesses often transfer the high costs they incur down to the end users. For 
instance, the fisherman would always factor the cost of fuel to be reflected in the price of fish that 
he sells to the consumers.
Diesel, petrol, zoom and lubricants are the main fuel types used in this sector.
Again, the Government believes that the fuels market in PNG must be open to competition so the 
fuel consumers benefit from comparatively cheaper fuel prices.
The aviation sector plays a pivotal role in the PNG economy. It is a sector that is so important to 
the country because of the rugged and mountainous conditions of the country.
Cost of air transportation is extremely high in PNG and perhaps this is one of the reasons why 
the cost structure of business in PNG is very high. In simple terms, it means that the high cost of 
fuel is captured in the prices of all other goods and services in the country.
The Government is aware that high aviation cost is a disincentive to investment in PNG including 
tourism. It will therefore take appropriate actions to address the high cost of aviation through 
competition and construction of more road infrastructures.
One key area of interest to the Government is to assess how Jet-A1 fuel can be produced 
domestically using domestically produced crude oil. Additionally, the PNG Government is aware 
that the international aviation industry is undertaking research and development in harnessing 
solar energy as an alternative fuels to the fossil-oriented Jet-A1 fuel. Therefore, the Government 
will closely observe the development and success in the use of this new technology so that it can 
be adopted in PNG aviation industry.
Use of biofuels in the aviation industry is now being used and PNG will consider this for the future.

5.1.2 Sea Transport Fuels
5.1.3 Air Transportation FuelsThe Government shall encourage competition in the fuels market in the entire business value 
chain. This means any investor can invest in a new refinery as long as they conform to quality 
standards and specifications. The PNG economy and the people would be the biggest beneficiaries 
under such a competitive market environment.
In order to promote efficiency and price transparency, the Government shall encourage the 
separation of ownership in all segments of the market from wholesaling to distribution and retailing.
The Government recognizes the importance of the fuels market and how important it is to growing 
the PNG economy and to improve the living standards of the people. Therefore efficient 
management of the sector is an important priority of the Government.
In order to reduce the cost of fuels, the Government would seek to secure feedstock crude oil 
from domestic oil and gas projects for another refinery to be built to create competition. The 
feedstock crude will come from a portion of the State’s equity share in various oil and gas fields 
in the country. Through appropriate policy the government would seek to obtain crude stock from 
any oil and gas projects at a Kina purchase price equivalent for refineries. This policy should also 
be applicable to the off-taker and utilization of natural gas for domestic purposes including the 
use of gas for transportation fuels such as CNG and LPGs.
The objective of this policy is to reduce the current high business cost structure in PNG which is 
a major disincentive to business and investment in the country. Hence, the Government aims to 
ensure the price of refined fuels in PNG is reduced by 40 - 50 percent of the current market price 
which is based on the Import Parity Price (IPP).
The Government would seriously look Into the commercial and technical viabilities of utilizing CNG 
and LPG as the predominant transportation fuels in PNG. Once studies confirm that CNG and LPG 
is feasible to be used, the Government would encourage the use of CNG and LPG in vehicles with 
the option of starting with public land transport.
All CNG and LPG requirements would be produced domestically and the feed gas would be sourced 
from a portion of the State equity interest in any oil and gas project in PNG or would be secured under 
the 15 per cent Gas Reservation Policy (or Domestic Market Obligation) and at a price equivalent to 
the cost of production.
The Government would invest in Research and Development in order to determine the feasibility of 
utilizing CNG and LPG in the marine transportation sector as well.

Many Governments around the world offer price subsidies to the fuels sector in order to relief 
businesses and citizens from high fuel prices. The PNG Government considers that the most 
appropriate way to support the economy and the citizens is to establish the appropriate policies 
as well as regulatory frameworks for a strong and robust market economy where competition is 
promoted so that the correct price is set by the market forces.
Promote the domestic production of transportation fuel, including alternative fuel, through the 
Downstream Processing of Hydrocarbons Policy and Renewable Energy Policy by the 
mandated entities.
Ensure rigorous enforcement of environmental standards/laws through responsible agencies 
like Climate Change and Development Authority and Conservation and Environment 
PttiAthit
The high costs of transportation fuel.
The heavy use of petroleum based fuel in the transportation sector which contributes to GHG 
emissions.
The lack of promotion and usage of alternative fuel sources like LPG, CNG, Methanol and Ethanol 
in vehicles including ships.
Lack of promotion and usage of technology/vehicles that use alternative fuels.
Lack of domestic production of Jet A1 fuel which contributes to high prices for this kind of fuel 
which affects aviation industry.
Lack of data collection on transportation fuel usage in the country.
Lack of clear policy and roll out plan for use of CNG and LPG.
Lack of a National Biofuels Policy.
The lack of competition in the transportation fuels market.
The lack of fiscal arrangements/incentives (like fuel subsidies for marginalised communities

9Electricity is a secondary source of energy generated through the consumption of primary energy 
sources namely fossil fuels, renewable energy and nuclear energy. By virtue of its versatility in 
application, it is crucial to economic growth and is the most sought after energy service by society. 
Access to electricity is associated with rising or high quality of life.
The Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) value chain consists of four elements, as shown below.
Competition in the industry generally means competition in the generation of electricity as well as in 
the commercial functions. The transportation (transmission and distribution) as well as system 
operation functions are generally natural monopolies (particularly in a developing economy) as it 
does not make economic, environmental or aesthetic sense to build multiple sets of competing 
systems in any one area. System operations is also non-competitive, since the system operator has 
to control all the plants in a control area, otherwise the system would not function efficiently or safely.
The Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) in Papua New Guinea has been undergoing reforms and 
restructuring since the mid-90s with the aims of, inter alia:

6.1 BACKGROUND
First, there is generation, requiring both a fuel source (e.g. hydro, geothermal, petroleum or wind 
energy) and a power plant to convert the fuel source into electrical energy.
Second, the generated electricity is transformed (stepped up) for transmission over high voltage 
power lines; and matching end user requirements (demand) with energy availability (supply), 
referred to as system operations.
The third element is distribution where electricity is transformed again (stepped down) to enable 
delivery or supply of electrical energy to end users or consumers via a vast network of power 
lines and substations.
Finally, there is delivery or supply which entails retailing of electrical energy to consumers through 
a series of commercial functions - procuring, pricing, selling, metering, billing and revenue 
collection.
Generation, transmission, system operations and distribution are physical functions while 
wholesaling and delivery/retailing are merchant or commercial functions.

Fuel/ Energy 
Source Generation Transmission Distribution Delivery
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY INDUSTRY 6Demand for electricity has shown an upward trend since the year 2011 due to accelerated economic 
growth. Figure 6, below shows ICCC’s forecasted demand for electricity (regulated and total 
demand).
PNG does not operate on an interconnected national power grid instead with only islanded electricity 
networks located around the more populated areas and industrial sites. Out of the total 580 MW 
installed generation capacity in PNG, PPL capacity is estimated at 300 MW while the 280 MW is 
generated by other entities that consume power mainly for their own use (e.g. mining enclaves).
Due to the population distribution where the majority of the population live in rural areas (and difficult 
terrain) the electrification access coverage is only 13% in PNG; with less than 1% access to 
electricity by most people in the outer provinces, except NCD with some 16.4% access to electricity 
in terms of the total population.
Creating a more competitive market structure with clear definition of roles for public and private sector 
players in generation, transmission, distribution and retail functions.

Ensuring provision of affordable, reliable, efficient, accessible and sustainable electric power supplies.
Increasing the population’s access to electricity as a means of stimulating economic growth. To 
date only 13 percent of the households are connected to electricity after 50 years of existence by

PNG Energy Demand
Requested Energy ReviewMajor drivers of the demand include increased economic activities in various zones, particularly 
within the Lae (Ramu), Port Moresby and Gazelle systems. Additional latent demand coming mainly 
from the extractive industries remains unmet due to the very large electricity requirements. Table 3 
below shows PPLs generation demand per zones as of end of 2014. 
It is anticipated that electricity demand will rise sharply as energy intensive activities such as mining, 
infrastructure developments, new LNG facilities, commercial and residential building constructions 
and numerous other activities are ramped up in the short to medium term. Table 4 below shows 
some of the recent and proposed project in the mining sector with estimated electricity demand.

6.3 ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION
Electricity generation in PNG is liberalised with several licensed electric power producers whose 
combined installed capacity was 580 MW as of December 20136 . This includes privately owned 
generation by major mining activities. A combination of several renewable and non-renewable 
sources used for this generation as shown in Figure 7 below.
1
6.3.1 BackgroundThe Ramu (especially Lae City) and the Port Moresby Systems rely on hydro power generated 
from Yonki in Eastern Highlands Province and Rouna in Central Province. These hydro powered 
centres are also backed up by diesel power stations (both reciprocating diesel generators and 
open cycle gas fired turbine generators being run on heated diesel). Western Power also relies 
on small diesel power stations to supply electricity to its customers in Western Province.
IPP’s like PNG Forest Products Limited, PNG Biomass, Oil Search Limited and Hanjung Power 
Limited generate power in Bulolo, Markham, Hides and Kanudi respectively and sell the power 
generated to PPL.
Whilst total installed capacity stands at some 580 MW, total electricity demand is projected to 
increase to a substantial 800 MW by year 2020.
In order to provide affordable electricity for these activities which are expected to transform our 
economy, a roadmap to raise the generation capacity has to be undertaken.
The road map (NEROP) will require the construction of various transmission lines to evacuate 
power to respective load centres. This will require significant investment by the Government.

Thermal power plants generate electrical energy using fossil fuels mainly, oil, natural gas and 
clean coal.
All thermal generating plants in PNG are run on imported petroleum fuels which are subject to 
volatile international oil market prices which are passed through to consumers. Consumption of 
oil will be progressively reduced and be replaced by natural gas and biofuels in the medium to 
long term.
Thermal power generation:
Inadequate infrastructure for power supply to communities in the neighbourhood of generation plants. 
High recurrent cost due to use of petroleum fuels as well as operation and maintenance cost,

which are site specific.
Attractive to private investment due to faster return on investment.

and other legislations and vest the regulating of the industry with the industry regulator. The NEA 
will initially be the principal regulator until the establishment of an independent regulatory entity.
The NEA shall review the Electricity Industry Policy as a matter of urgency to complement this 
National Energy Policy.

electricity supply infrastructure.
The Government shall encourage electricity generation using renewable energy sources through 
PPPs and IPPs.

gas and clean coal through PPPs and IPPs for base load power.
The Government will ensure that all equipment procured for thermal power plants shall be 
designed and constructed to minimise the environmental impact while giving consideration 
to visual impact, wildlife and temporary disturbance during construction, maintenance and 
operation.
The Government shall promote the utilisation of Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plants to 
increase efficiency.

Combustion of fuels cause environmental pollution which requires costly mitigation measures.
Thermal power plants have a relatively shorter life span of about 10 to 20 years compared to 
hydropower plants which have a lifespan of over 50 years.
Thermal power has relatively lower conversion efficiency of less than 50% compared to 
hydropower plants which have over 90% efficiency.

6.3.2.4 Strategies - Electric Power Generation6.4 GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY USING NUCLEAR ENERGY
6.5 ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION
The uptake of nuclear power technology has been growing over time across different countries 
and regions. Various countries without existing nuclear power technology in their power systems 
have expressed interest in investing in nuclear electricity production while developed countries 
with existing nuclear plants have been expanding their capacities. All over the world, as of 
September 2013, there were 435 nuclear power plants in operation, 28 under construction and 
222 in the planning stage. 
Although PNG does not have a clear position on Nuclear energy development and deployment it 
is recognised as a form of energy used in other developed and developing countries, which PNG 
could develop in time.
Careful policy considerations are required before PNG embarks on any concrete plans to 
develop nuclear energy due to serious dangers associated with explosions causing loss to 
human lives and damages to environment.
The existing transmission network is currently confined to the three (3) major systems in Port 
Moresby, Lae (Ramu) and Gazelle respectively as shown in the Figure 8 below. This system 
is anticipated to be extended dramatically in order to improve network coverage in line with the 
proposed National Electricity Rollout Plan (NEROP).

6.5.1 Background
Figure 8 - PPLs existing transmission network
Source: PNG Power Ltd, as at October 2014As part of its mandate, PPL is currently undertaking new transmission projects aimed at 
developing a robust grid system to:
There is a potential for Papua New Guinean transmission network to be interconnected with 
Australia and Indonesia’s system through a 400 kV or more double circuit transmission line. The 
arrangement would allow for electrical energy exchange between PNG and a number of Australian 
cities of the State of Queensland such as Gladstone; thus likewise corroborate to connect 
electricity systems to neighbouring cities in Indonesia.
At this stage, focus of the export of the energy would be between regional areas such as from 
Southern into the Highlands and onto the Momase Regions respectively via network connections 
of the main grids.
This existing transmission system capacity is severely constrained particularly during peak hours. 
The problem is partly due to inadequate reactive power in major load centres and also 
transmission constraints particularly in Port Moresby, Ramu and Gazelle systems.

6.5.2 Extension of the National Transmission Network
6.5.3 Regional Interconnection
Evacuate electricity through additional transmission lines across existing system including 
economic corridor system inter-connections.
Improve quality and reliability of electricity supply throughout the country by ensuring adequate 
evacuation capacity.
Reduce the cost of electricity to the consumer by absorbing the capitai cost of transmission lines 
since they will be fully funded by the National Government.
Provide interconnection links with the neighbouring countries in order to facilitate power exchange 
and develop electricity trade in the region.
Reduce transmission losses through upgrading of transmission line from current 60 kV to 132 kV 
for distances greater than 100 kilometres and up to 400 kV for distances greater than 500 kilometers.
Open up off-grid areas in order to ease connectivity to electricity by constructing transmission 
lines to link them up to the national grid. Alternatively, develop off-grid solutions for remote areas 
that are not economic to connect to the grid.
As earlier stated, the numerous economic activities springing up in major areas of the country 
requires a corresponding increase in generation capacity and transmission network. 
Consequently, the number of transmission lines projected for construction in the next 5 years 
needs to be substantial to meet this need. The NEROP is the vehicle to achieve these activities.

2010-2030 as shown in Figure 9 below.
The Ten (10) Economic Corridors are proposed to alleviate poverty, as they will be located in 
the poorest regions of PNG with the aim of extending the benefits of development to the 
most disadvantaged regions. This is the region where the government has plans to develop well 
planned zoning system, comprehensive and effective network of transport and utilities, 
quality education and health services.
Within this region, businesses are able to operate at low cost and well designed incentives, 
thereby encouraging foreign and domestic private sector investments. By concentrating the 
construction of essential infrastructure within certain regions the economic corridor approach 
takes advantage of the substantial economies of scale and scope associated with large service 
sector infrastructure.

6.5.7 Strategies - Electricity Transmission6.6 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION
The distribution network entails receipt of bulk supply of electrical energy from generation or 
transmission network and transfer of this energy through distribution lines and distribution 
substations to consumers.
Reliability and quality of supply remains a key area of concern. As such, more focus should be 
given to resolve repetitive breakdown cases to reduce the number of incidences and improve 
repair time. The sharp increase in vandalism considerably contributed to this worsening situation 
leading to a number of transformer failures and consequential power outages.
The technical and commercial losses arising during the transmission and distribution of electricity 
are as provided in Table 6.
The objective of the ongoing Energy Access Scale-Up (EAS-U) programme is to increase 
connectivity countrywide. It involves expansion of the national power distribution grid to connect 
new customers both in urban and rural areas through NEROP.
In addition, more projects will be initiated to reduce system losses, enhance reliability and quality 
of supply by enhancing the sub-transmission. By the year 2020, capacities of primary and 
distribution substations, High Voltage lines and Medium Voltage lines are estimated to increase 
substantially.
High end-user electricity tariffs including standing charges.
High electricity connection charges.
Vandalism of electric power infrastructure.
Lengthy process of way-leaves acquisition.
Encroachment of way-leaves trace.

the quality of supply and service.
Provincial Governments may plan and develop distribution networks and transfer them to 
distributors duly licensed to operate and maintain them in line with the national policy of 
having only one distributor in a given area at any particular time for efficiency and technical 
effectiveness of the national power network.
The National Government shall provide a legal framework to support open access of the 
distribution network taking into account existing contractual commitments and provide 
mechanism for determination of wheeling charges applicable to distribution lines.
The Government will continue funding the development of distribution network in rural areas 
and continue to support strengthening of distribution network in rest of the areas through 
licensed distributors through NEROP.
Most of the distribution networks in major cities, urban areas and the coastal strip are overhead 
and therefore prone to frequent interruptions due to corrosion and climatic changes.
High system losses.
Illegal power line connections and theft of electricity.
Physical plans in most cases do not provide an infrastructure corridor for electricity reticulation.
High arbitrary levies charged by the public institutions on power infrastructures.
Lack of a legal framework for operationalization of open access.

6.6.4 Strategies - Distribution
6.7 RURAL ELECTRIFICATION
Energy shortages and supply disruptions coupled with high cost remains serious obstacles to 
economic activity in PNG. At present 87% of the PNG’s population still lack access to electricity 
services and the progress of rural electrification has lagged over the years.
Some Provincial Governments and District Development Authorities (DDAs) have embarked on 
various rural electrification programs with PPL, unguided by any appropriate policy mechanisms. 
Making electricity accessible to the masses at the rural levels would require a holistic government 
approach.
1
2
6.7.1 BackgroundHigh costs of connection.
Scattered population settlements in the rural areas leading to long distribution lines. The 
uncontrolled sub-division of arable land has escalated this problem.
Harsh terrains and inaccessibility due to under developed infrastructure leads to high cost of rural 
electrification projects.
High operating costs of grids in rural areas due to low population density.
Difficulties with acquisition of way-leaves, due to high compensation demand by land owners.
Vandalism of power infrastructure.
Outdated or lack of land use master plans which have made it difficult and expensive to acquire

6.7.4 Cross Cutting Issues
6.7.3 Strategies - Rural ElectrificationThe policy and decision making processes by public energy sector players are complicated by 
their corporate governance structures which are influenced by government policy, board appointments, 
existing laws and regulations.
High cost of financing energy infrastructure projects.
Insufficient fiscal and other incentives for private sector investment.
Lack of adequate port facilities for handling cheaper energy resources including clean coal and 
natural gas to support power generation.
The restructuring of the sector creates challenges due to existing obligations including Power 
Purchase Agreements (PPAs), financial covenants and asset ownership.
Demand for power in some areas is low due to lack of economic activities as well as poor 
infrastructure rendering some of the electrification projects unsustainable.

d]Reform of the electricity sector is required in view of the very low access at 13% to the people of PNG 
since 1963 when electricity first became available in the country. It is time for review and reform of 
the sector.
The major focus on the reform of the electricity sector should be the institutional structures currently 
in place.
It is very clear that PNG Power Limited which has been in the forefront of energy delivery services in 
the country has done very little to change the picture of very low power access to the people of this 
country.
Poor management, political interference and restrictive policies of government with regard to PPL 
have been the main reasons for poor performance in delivery of electricity services.
PPL being not a fully commercial entity has faced a major challenge over many years of balancing 
improvement in its economic returns versus the social obligations of providing subsidised electricity 
to its domestic consumers.
Some seminars and reports recommended “Unbundling” of a number of State Owned Enterprises 
(SOEs) including PPL as the way forward.
Some of the reasons put forward by experts organisations including ADB and NRI for 
non-performance of SOEs and recommendation of unbundling of these SOEs are as follows;
Policy interventions are required to make SOEs more commercially oriented. In this regard, commercially 
oriented organisations or entities should be created to manage the evolving electricity industry.
The recent declaration of Emergency within the Electricity Services by the National Executive Council 
in its Decision No.357/2014, supports the notion that drastic measures have to be taken to turn the

7 ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY
7.1 PNG POWER LIMITEDTo address these concerns raised in NEC Decision No. 357/2014, it now seems inevitable that 
separate commercially oriented entities should be established for generation, transmission, distribution 
and retailing.
In terms of Generation, the Electricity Industry Policy allows for competition within PPL’s exclusive 
zone (10 km radius). The Government should establish companies to be involved in power generation 
on their own or through Joint Ventures or Public Private Partnerships (PPP).
In the case of PPL generation companies’ specific to PPL assets can be established to manage 
production and sale of electricity. Other SOEs have established similar subsidiaries to engage in 
commercial ventures in their respective sectors.
Transmission is currently under PPL by law. Further reforms to Transmission will be effected when 
the interconnections are established throughout the country because it will be too difficult for PPL to 
manage.
Currently PPL is responsible for Distribution and Retailing of electricity. Future reforms on the 
Distribution and Retailing will depend on the consumer base in the country. 
10
11
12
13
14It is the aim of the Government to ensure that the cost of electricity usage by consumers in terms 
of tariffs is affordable, that the cost of new connections as a result of network extensions is also 
affordable. This requires taking into accounthigher cost areas of investments through suitable price 
regulation by the price regulator and the need for a clear CSO framework. Some rural areas in PNG 
may not present a prospective outlook for commercial investments and cannot attract investors, 
thus would normally be bypassed and left out in the provision of and from the benefits of electricity 
services.
A community service obligation is defined, in generic term, in one of the two categories of definitions 
adopted from a Commonwealth study in 1994, as:
This definition will be further clarified in a specific CSO policy to be developed by the Government. 
However, for current purposes, these generic definitions will be adopted for the electricity sector in 
PNG. For the electricity sector, the Government will need to provide incentives to encourage investments 
in rural areas and utilize the private sector including procurement option of public-private partnership 
(PPP) to deliver CSOs on its behalf with the consideration of not jeopardizing their commercial 
interests.
CSOs may be in the form of functions performed, services provided and the allowance made for 
concessions that should entail greater private sector participation. CSOs are purchased from 
or facilitated through private entities operating on commercial interests by the Government for its 
targeted constituents.
In line with the underlying approach of this Policy and consistent with the current regulatory framework 
that this Policy basically retains, the targeted constituents for CSOs would be the small loads (less 
than 10 MW by individual demand for power) in, especially, rural areas. There is a need to clearly 
define, identify, and cost out possible CSOs as part of the implementation of this Policy and prioritize 
those CSOs in accordance with the funds available to implement this Policy.
CSO to be implemented on cost basis with investment partners.
Some of the specific subjects to be addressed in the future after the adoption of this policy are;

provision of service, to some customers at least, at a price less than the cost of production;
doing things for reason of government policy, which commercial enterprises operating in a 
competitive environment and subject to normal government regulations, would not do.
Under this Policy, the NEA (as the regulator of electricity price) will implement a commercial 
price regulation model that features price flexibilities reflecting on the costs of investments to 
i.
ii.
a) Tariff regulation in delivery of Community Service Obligation.
COMMUNITY SERVICE OBLIGATIONS 8The current tax provisions provide a range of rural development incentives that will be available 
to certain investors in relation to this Policy. The tax incentives include accelerated and 
flexible depreciation as well as income tax exemptions on the net income of new business set 
up in specifically designated under-developed areas that are not dependent on the exploitation 
of natural resources. New “rural development industries” as defined under the Income Tax 
Act exempt from income tax for ten years after the year the business commences operation. 
Eligibility for these tax concessions are assessed and determined by the Internal Revenue 
Commission (IRC) and will depend on compliance with the specific provisions and conditions 
in the Income Tax Act.
A suitable mechanism is required for ensuring that intervention of State financing by the 
Government so CSOs are effective and efficient. State financing should be focused on 
clearly identified CSOs, appropriately costed and tendered to the lowest substantive bidder to 
achieve the lowest - cost delivery of the CSO. With the industry being opened up for competition, 
IPPs can take the opportunity to compete with PPL for the money that the State makes 
available for funding the Government’s CSOs.
Delivering CSOs for the electricity sector is the sole responsibility of Department of Treasury 
responsible for managing the Government’s policy on these CSOs and their administration.
The management of the CSO delivery and as part of its overall planning and implementation 
of this Policy, it is necessary for the Government to implement the National Electrification 
Roll-Out Plan (NEROP).
In the case of market failure where there is an inability to achieve economies of scale, there 
would not be an interest from the private sector to deliver Government’s CSOs. For the 
Government to use PPL to deliver CSOs in this situation will have detrimental ramifications 
on PPL to operate as a commercial entity, hence undermining its capability to be competitive 
in the contestable industry.
There is an inherent inability to recover costs on the provision of electricity services to rural 
areas in PNG broadly. The differential between the postage stamp price (which is a feature 
of the current regulatory framework) and the actual cost of service provision does not 
usually prove economic sense for private sector investments as it only makes the outcome 
of a rural electrification venture unprofitable or a loss.
The current practice of allowing flexible price regulation to allow investment in higher cost 
areas to take place, addresses this issue in some way. In addition to this the policy measure 
of identifying, costing and funding CSOs should enable the extension of rural networks or 
building electricity assets in new and potential market areas. The government agency that is 
responsible for implementing CSOs in rural electrification will opt for whichever of these two
options that is more efficient when executing the normal competitive tender process and 
b) Available tax incentives of the Government.
c) State Financing towards Community Service Obligations through Competitive Tender
d) Delivering Community Service Obligations
e) Rural Electrification under CSOState financing should not only be employed to progress rural electrification at the exclusion 
of urban areas, however, urban areas (or parts of them) need to be assessed against a CSO 
framework to ensure that the activity is actually a CSO before they are costed and financed.
State financing towards these network extension projects will solely and independently be 
determined by the Government in line with its priority for electrification and not influenced by 
PPL’s request for assistance. All “profitable” ventures to PPL in this area of supply will not 
be subsidized by the Government as they do not qualify for State financing.
The economic regulator will require adequate access to information on PPL to assist the 
Government to properly assess and determine this.
Competition for the market will ensure IPPs “monopolizing” certain market areas. IPPs 
whose operations feature rural electrification should be favoured in large loads. Where rural 
electrification priorities of the Government in line with its CSOs warrant it, and as it deems 
efficient, the Government will continue to subsidize existing producers in the area to 
progress rural electrification. Otherwise, the Government will open up competition for fresh 
entry into the market and subsidize the construction of new electricity assets through the 
appropriate process it administers.
Where the State subsidizes a CSO, the State will not be the owner of the assets. Should the 
State retain ownership of these assets, there would likely be a conflict of interest with PPL 
being a state-owned entity. For the private investors, retaining ownership of assets would 
also provide an incentive to maintain the assets and ensure their efficient operation. It is 
intended that the developers of electricity assets that are developed with some State subsidy
would own and operate these assets on commercial basis. PPL could own and operate 
these assets if it tendered the best proposal to the Government.
The State may retain the right of ownership over all the electricity transmission infrastructure 
and networks in PNG. The generation, distribution and retail segments of the electricity 
industry are open for private sector ownership

Major energy projects in the country source goods and services both domestically and overseas.
Local Content refers to the procurement or sourcing of goods and services from domestic and 
international sources by a Locally Owned Company engaged by the Energy Project Developer 
Company.
Locally Owned Companies are those companies which are majority owned (51 % +) by the 
citizens of Papua New Guinea from immediate project areas.
The concept of Local Content is to enable or encourage more locally owned companies to 
participate as sub-contractors or otherwise, hence creating more business and employment 
opportunities within the local/domestic economy.
Local content also includes employment of citizens with various skills level in any energy project
Absence of a Local Content Policy and Plan.
Inadequate capacity and capabilities of Locally Owned Companies for technically complex tasks.
Lack of funding and finance for locally owned companies.
Lack of compliance by major energy project developers on Project Agreements.
Lack of monitoring and enforcement by State agencies on Project Agreements.

9.3 DOWNSTREAM PROCESSING IN THE PETROLEUM SECTOR
Papua New Guinea is strategically located in a region where both oil and gas reserves are 
abundant within the Asia/Pacific region which comprises countries such as Australia, 
Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia. These countries have established world class petroleum 
and associate industries such as LNG and Petrochemicals by effectively utilizing their 
petroleum resources. They also compete against each other in order to secure as much 
market share in the region and at the global scenario. In the Asia/Pacific region, buyers are 
driving hard bargain in price to take advantage of the increase of supply in the Gas markets. 
Products such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Dimethyl ether (DME) are expected 
to increase in competition with other well established fuels. Competitiveness in costs and 
environmental factors are key factors to securing products, markets by attracting investors. 
In order for PNG to be competitive and secure leadership in such highly competitive Asia/Pacific 
regional markets and also attract potential investors, it is of critical importance that the 
Government formulates an attractive policy directive and an enabling environment targeting 
commercial and bankable investments in Downstream Processing in the Petroleum Sector 
(Oil & Gas).
PNG Petroleum Sector must support the growth of an economically viable and vibrant 
downstream sector which will in turn provide a strong foundation for large-scale downstream 
processing. This will in turn enhance Gas-based activities in a sustainable, environmentally 
friendly and safe approach, hence:
The current Government’s focus to promote investments in the local content in downstream 
activities is more than monitoring direct monetary benefits. The promotion of downstream 
processing supports the National Energy Policy to grow the economy as reflected in the Government’s 
Development Strategic Plan (DSP 2010 - 2030) and Vision 2050. This will encourage the 
procurement of products and services and utilising local sub-contractors for the purpose of 
provision of goods and services to the projects and act as a major boost to the economy. This 
will maximise the Government’s gains as a result of the economy multiplier effects triggered

9.4.1 Background9.5 ENERGY PROJECT ENVIRONMENT REHABILITATION
Projects involving energy, use varying amounts of finite resources like water and land. For 
instance, drilling and exploring for oil and gas uses less land than coal or uranium mining.
Likewise producing energy from Geothermal plants uses significantly less land/space and water 
than a hydro dam and its reservoir.
Some may cause minimal disruption to the local ecosystem like solar and wind turbines. Some 
may be eco - friendly in that they use waste products to produce energy like biofuels from cooking oil.
The rehabilitation of the environment after these projects have come to the end of their life is 
crucial.
In Papua New Guinea, most petroleum projects leave little environmental footprint. Experience 
from mining projects especially Ok Tedi, Panguna and Misima leaves a lot to be desired. There 
are no major mining of coal and uranium activities as yet, if they do happen, they must not follow 
the same path.
Rehabilitation of hydro reservoirs has not yet been experienced since these projects are currently 
operational. However, impact of the environment downstream must be catered for in any 
rehabilitation plan under the Project Agreement.
Solar and wind are harnessed but on a much smaller scale and not industrial.
Biofuel is yet to take off on a large scale. Its production from plantations, smallholders, etc. then 
needs to be taken into account as they will leave an environmental footprint.
Some unsustainable Biomass is also one sector that may leave a big footprint. However, 
sustainably grown biomass which does not impinge on native forests has a significant footprint 
and does not require rehabilitation, as it results in increased forest area over project life, however

All facets of energy development, production, usage and conservation need a trained pool of 
people to manage.
Technical people like petroleum and nuclear engineers, geologists are needed mostly in the 
operational areas of energy.
In addition, good quality energy policy analysts, etc. are needed.
PNG currently has no specific training related directly to energy. However, the recent move by 
UPNG to introduce the Bachelor of Sustainable Development which contain aspects of climate 
change and energy conservation.
There were recent moves by the WNBP Governor to send mothers to India for Solar Academy 
training.
Most projects are required to produce a Training and Localisation Plan prior to developing a 
resource. Most do not comply with this Plan.
Developers lack of compliance with the Training and Localisation Plan.
Lack of trained researchers and academics specialised in Energy Development and use.
Robust enforcement and inspection by State Agencies to ensure that a developer adheres to a 
training and localization plan that it submits.

10.3 STRATEGIES FOR ENERGY FINANCING
The funding required for the energy sector is substantial so needs to be based on sustainable and 
viable economic models. New investments are needed for exploration, utilization, generation, 
transmission and distribution activities. Long-term financing options that involve both foreign and 
domestic financing resources are required. However, foreign investment capital and national foreign 
earnings provide the greater proportion of needed funds.
The Government shall continue to encourage private sector investment in the energy sector through 
Public Private Partnership (PPP).
To attract foreign investment in the energy sector, certain necessary conditions would have to be 
met. Experience has shown that some Independent Power Producers (IPPs) require incentives to 
mitigate their perceived political and economic risks.
Inadequate funding for the energy sector.
Lack of continuity in the funding of projects in the energy sector.
Low foreign investment from a highly competitive international finance market.
Inadequate local development of energy technologies.
Insufficient scale and development of a competitive domestic energy industry to yet develop an 
energy trading mechanism for spot and long term markets.
Foreign exchange fluctuations.
Historic over reliance on volatile US dollar-denominated and oil price based fuels such as heavy fuel 
oil and diesel
The Government shall explore and adopt all viable financing options from local and international 
sources to ensure cost effective utilization of all its energy resources, in economic order of merit and 
so shall endeavour to maintain a competitive fiscal investment climate in the country.
The Government shall continue to provide financial support for energy infrastructure development.

10.5 ENERGY TRADING
Electricity is a commodity capable of being bought, sold and traded in a well-developed electricity 
market, particularly if generation from multiple interconnected generation exceeds available system 
demand. However, Electricity unlike other products is by its nature difficult to store and has to be
available on demand. In addition, it is likely to be some years before PNG has the pre-conditions 
necessary to have a competitive supply-side market. Therefore, there is a physical requirement for a 
controlling agency, the transmission system operator to coordinate the dispatch of generating units 
to meet the expected demand of the system across the transmission grid. Under this policy, it is 
envisaged that the ENERCOM will perform that role.
National Electricity Market involves both large scale wholesale generation that is transported via 
interconnected grid of high voltage transmission lines to electricity distributors, who deliver it to 
consumers (residences, industries and commercial users).
In a mature market the transport of electricity from generators to consumers is facilitated through 
a ‘pool’, or spot market, where the output from all generators is aggregated and scheduled at five 
minute intervals to meet demand.
The pool is not a physical thing but a set of procedures that ENERCOM will manage in line with 
National Electricity Law and National Electricity Rules.
The market uses sophisticated systems to send signals to generators instructing them how much 
energy to produce each five minutes so that production is matched to consumer requirements, spare 
capacity is kept ready for emergencies, and the current energy price can be calculated.
The scope of each electricity market consists of the transmission grid or network that is available to 
the wholesalers, retailers and the ultimate consumers in any geographic area.
A wholesale electricity market exists when competing generators offer their electricity output to 
retailers. The retailers then re-price the electricity and take it to market. Large end-users seeking 
to cut out unnecessary overhead in their energy costs are beginning to recognize the advantages 
inherent in such a purchasing move

710.6 ENERGY PRICING AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC ISSUES
The Government shall set up a National Energy Fund (NEF) under the National Energy Authority 
(NEA) to cater for the following: -
Electricity pricing shall be based on the principles of Long Run Marginal Cost of supply. The 
End-User-Tariff incorporates all prudent costs in the value chain and a fair return to the investors. 
The bulk tariffs are negotiated between producers and the off-taker, however, the Power 
Purchase Agreement is subject to approval by ENERCOM. The retail tariffs are regulated by 
the Commission and may be subject to review at least every five years.
Fuel costs and exchange rates gains/losses are pass-through costs in the current regime. 
These account for power cost variations in the event of fluctuation in the international crude 
oil prices as well as instability with PNG Kina against foreign currencies, mainly the US Dollar.
PNG imports some petroleum products from overseas (eg. Heavy fuel oil and diesel). The 
international price of crude oil and petroleum products has been on a steady increase 
(reduced significantly recently but volatile) and has had an impact on the cost of petroleum 
and associated products.
The impact of crude oil price increases lead to inflationary pressure in the economy which 
is translated to increases in prices of goods and services. This tends to depreciate 
the exchange rate and increase interest rates. An increase in diesel prices leads to an 
increase in farming costs, the cost of inputs in the manufacturing and transport sectors and 
subsequently an increase in consumer prices making PNG products uncompetitive. With 
the income of consumers remaining relatively constant, these increases lead to erosion of 
purchasing power of the consumers in addition to reducing monies for other needs. 
The Impact of crude oil price reliance also means energy pricing is volatile, multiplied by 
the USD - Kina price movements, which inhibits the ability to make long term investment 
decisions in a certain price environment. Therefore a key aim is to diversify electricity supply 
sources to help mitigate this volatility through the Kina and Kina - USD price cycle.
The reliability of energy services enjoyed by the urban energy users is unreliable by 
international standards because of the way the energy sector is structured in the country. 
The conditions of modern energy infrastructure in PNG is in a deplorable state and needs to 
be upgraded or replaced to ensure that these facilities perform to the highest expectations to 
deliver the energy services required by the end users.
Demand for production and utilization of energy is a function of price. It is important to take 
into consideration the low ability of paying energy users amongst large sections of the 
population.
When developing or constructing modern energy infrastructure it is essential that the developers 
must consider imposing affordable energy price and risk (fix cost and volatility) to the

the situations that bring about unaffordable prices of energy services.
consumers. The developers must consider appropriate cost savings in the designs of the 
energy infrastructure through improved operating efficiencies and minimizing on unnecessary 
expenditure.
4
To improve reliability of energy services competition will be promoted and introduced in 
the energy sector. Competition in energy supply provides choice to consumers, places 
downwards pressure on prices and incentivizes efficient investment. However given the 
current stage of development of the energy market, particularly the low rate of electrification, 
competition is best introduced to minimise costs once the sector is sufficiently developed 
and electricity penetration reach developing country norms. Competition for the 
opportunity to develop already occurs so market supply competition is still some years 
away.
The Government will push for reforms and initiate programmes for ensuring energy 
markets continue to work effectively and competition is promoted.
Tariff regulation, as a second best option to competitive markets would continue to play 
an important role in ensuring an affordable and reliable energy to end users.

10.6.1.3 Competitive Energy Markets
The petrol and diesel prices are largely determined by international oil markets. However, the 
Government will over-see oil markets to ensure petrol and diesel prices at the pump to fairly reflect 
industry costs as per international oil market.
Similar to the gas sector, oil commercialization and development will be promoted in PNG in the 
future to reduce reliance on fuel imports and promote energy security.
Investment in property relating to exploitation of natural resources for energy production must 
benefit the local communities and their economies as well as future generations. Therefore there 
is need to provide:

10.6.2 Over-seeing Oil Market
10.6.3 Other Socio-Economic Issues
A framework to ensure that local communities benefit from energy resources within their region.
A funded, national coordinated rural electrification program is required.
The Electricity Trust Fund (ETF) is proposed to solicit and fund rural electrification project 
proposals across the country. This will make rural electrification an active national policy, and 
will ensure equity, effective coordination and sustainability.
a]
b]10.7 THE TARIFFS AND PRICING MECHANISMS
Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a low electrification rate compared to other similar developing 
countries whilst the sector has a vertically integrated monopoly with a few independent power 
producers. Given such a scenario, PNG has developed and now had in place its own electricity 
sector policies. Since there are provisions in the regulatory licensing framework for private sector 
participation, these arrangements can be combined with some elements by learning through the 
reformed experiences of other developing countries that could be considered for the way forward 
in reforming the sector’s regulation, thus encouraging competition to improve efficiency in 
the provision of electricity services.
As such, given that there is potential for more competition in the electricity sector with increasing 
number of interest shown by the private sector to participate on the back end of high demand for 
electricity due to increase economic activities, the regulatory arrangements and tariff structuring 
will provide provisions for continuous restructuring and adjustment overtime, concurrent with the 
development in the electricity industry.
Therefore, to accommodate the increasing interests shown by the private sector to participate 
in all or any of the segments of the electricity sector, certain form of pricing mechanism or tariff 
structure need to be set in place to provide and or administer the returns on the value of investments.
The ENERCOM must be encouraged through the existing regulatory framework to implement a 
robust price mechanism that is conducive to and or favourable for all entrants into the different 
segments of the industry, to ensure industry development and gain a positive return on their 
investments thus promoting accessibility, affordability and reliability in the industry.
Furthermore, ENERCOM must consider the different areas of operations, in terms of the urban 
and rural settings and the respective low and high cost areas; and apply different charges at 
those varying connection(s) points with those parties, albeit set an appropriate price mechanism 
and or tariff structure that will drive efficiency.
More so, in order to achieve the overarching objectives of this policy; apart from other strategies, 
there is considerable need for structuring and setting of pricing mechanism. Any proposed price 
mechanism should be reviewed and structured concurrently with the phase of development, 
restructuring and eventual defragmentation of the electricity industry.
Currently there exists a Tariff structure that ts applied specifically by the regulated retailer PNG 
Power Limited, being the regulated retailer applies a uniform tariff across its entire network.
Distinctively, there are some price mechanisms currently applicable through third party access 
that are covered by the Third Party Access Code (TPA). However, in observing how the current 
pricing mechanism in the industry works, it may not be fully reflective of the different structure of 
the restructured electricity industry.
Therefore, the different tariff structure for different settings of the defragmented sectors of the 
electricity industry must be established, particularly if PPL eventually moves to a Regional 
Model, there may be an opportunity to move to a ‘cost-reflective’ tariff that reduces costs in a 
region (e.g. Ramu Grid), rather than having the same national tariff, so any cross- subsidisation is 
made explicit and transparent. In essence, the policy is making provision for the establishment of 
different tariff structure for different defragmented sectors of the industry and provides provision 
for adjustment and review of the tariff structures to be on par with the structuring of the industry 
overtime

10.7.1 BackgroundIn consideration of the complexity involved in the tariff calculation and design, especially in 
regards to obtaining of relevant efficient costs inputs of the firms in question, and the asymmetry 
of information between the regulator and the regulated entity; an efficient market tariff price 
cannot be easily determined. Nonetheless, regulation of price to mimic the competitive market 
has continued to be adopted worldwide as the second best option.
The current Papua New Guinea electricity tariff setting arrangements can be best illustrated in 
the following diagram hereunder.
T1 T2 and T3 are the three different points at which the tariffs are charged. T1 is the tariff agreed 
between the IPP and the Off-taker. T2 is the potential tariff for a transmission company charged 
to and bought by the distribution company. T3 is the retail tariff charged by the distributor to the 
retail customers.
A large proportion of tariff differentials occur at T3, under price discrimination and segmenting due 
to the varied customer segments - such as industrial, household and public institutions. Similar 
price differentials occur at T1 due to the varied costs structures of the generating firms resulting in 
different tariff rates if they are IPP’s. PPL should also move to explicit tariffs (transfer pricing) over 
time as it does not currently explicitly recognise the cost of its internally generated power. This 
is the case given that all firms operating in the industry would not necessarily have similar cost 
structures.
The current electricity tariff pricing regime administered by the Independent Consumer Competition 
Commission (ICCC) under its own Act (ICCC Act , No 6 of 2002), the economic regulator of the 
electricity industry focuses on tariffs charged at point T3 with an oversight on T1. The principle 
behind it, is for the firm to recover its efficient costs of investment, with a reasonable return on its
investments.
Tariff between the IPPs and Off-taker in T1 remains negotiable between the parties through a 
Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). However, the ICCC does have an oversight in setting of the 
Reference Price, agreed to it by the Regulator, based on information supplied to it by the regulated 
entity (Retailer). This is consistent with the pricing arrangements provided for under the Third 
Party Access Code (TPA Code).

10.7.3 Pricing Mechanism under the Third Party Access Code
The Third Party Access Code and Grid Code were developed through the Electricity 
Industry Policy. The TPA Code was released by ICCC and became effective on the 1st of 
January 2014. The objective of the TPA was to facilitate improved access, reliability and 
affordability of electricity throughout PNG by:

10.7.3.3 Pricing Mechanisms under the TPA Code
Reference Prices - which set out the maximum price a regulated retailer will pay for electricity 
generation.
Wheeling Arrangements - which set out the conditions and charges under which third 
parties can access PNG Power Limited’s transmission networks.
Connections arrangements - which set out the conditions and charges for connection to 
PNG Power Limited’s transmission networks by third parties.
Improve transparency with regards to power purchase contracting between IPPs 
and Regulated Retailers.
Constrains the ability of Regulated Retailers to unfairly discriminate against potential 
competitors.
Protect Transmission Network Operators’ commercial interests by clarifying how 
they are remunerated by Third Parties connecting to and wheeling power through 
their network.
Constrains the ability of Transmission Network Operator that performs System 
Operator functions from unfairly discriminating against Third Parties.
The Power Purchase Reference Price (PPRP) provides for purchasing power at a 
prudent and efficient cost for the retailer to pass-through to consumers. The power 
purchase price sets the upper bound for and as a benchmark for retailers purchasing 
from power producers. It is required under the TPA Code that regulated retailers must 
submit a statement of power purchase reference price to the regulator for approval. The 
regulator will assess, approve and do publication of the approved power purchase 
reference prices for the participants in the industry to apply these references accordingly 
to the different energy sources.
According to the TPA Code, the Transmission Network Owner must provide 
non-discrIminatory rights to use or access its transmission network to third parties for 
the purpose of supplying large load customersThird parties wheeling power through the

Thus, any third party willing to connect to the network must pay for the connection charges 
and connection services charges in accordance with the approved SoCS procedures and 
charges.

to ensure that the prices charged by licensees are fair to consumers and sufficient to 
allow the licensees finance their activities and to allow for reasonable earnings for efficient 
operation.

10.7.3.4 Challenges Facing Papua New Guinea in Tariff Setting
10.7.3.5 Tariff Setting Principles
The transmission network owner or the regulated retailer is also required under the 
TPA Code to submit a Statement of Wheeling Arrangements and Charges to the 
regulator to approve before the regulated retailer of the third party is allowed to use 
transmission network for wheeling. An open and transparent public process of consultation is adopted, with a holistic and 
scientific approach to balancing electricity tariffs to ensure a fair and cost-reflective tariff 
regime capable of supporting the growth of the industry, whilst attracting new investment 
into the sector.
The key principles that the National Energy Authority of Papua New Guinea (NEA) need to 
be cognisant of in terms of setting the tariffs for each of the generation, transmission and 
distribution (including retail) sectors are:
3
4
Cost recovery / financial viability - regulated entities should be permitted to recover 
their (efficient) costs, including a reasonable rate of return on capital.
Signals for investment - prices should encourage an efficient level and nature of 
investment (e.g. location) in the industry.
Certainty and stability of the pricing framework is also important for private sector 
investment.
Efficient use of the network - generally, this requires “efficient” prices that reflect the 
marginal costs that users impose on the system and the reduction of cross-subsidies.
Allocation of risk - pricing arrangements should allocate risks efficiently (generally to 
those who are best placed to manage them).
Simplicity and cost-effectiveness - the tariff structure and regulatory system should 
be easy to understand and not excessively costly to implement (e.g. facilitate metering 
and billing).
Incentives for improving performance - the way which prices are regulated should 
give appropriate incentives for operators to reduce costs and/or increase quality of 
service.
Transparency/fairness - prices should be non-discriminatory and transparent. 
Non-discriminatory access to monopoly networks is also a key prerequisite for effective 
competition in the contestable sectors.
Flexibility/robustness - the pricing framework needs to be able to cater for unforeseen 
changes in circumstances.
Social and political objectives - the pricing framework needs to provide for the 
achievement of social policy goals such as universal access, demand-side management 
and user affordability.

10.7.4 Feed in Tariff (FiT)
FiT is a convenient tool for many countries, that is strongly recommended for PNG to 
encourage renewable energy generation.
Feed in Tariffs (FiT) are fixed electricity prices that are paid to Renewable Energy (RE) 
producers for each unit of energy produced and injected into the electricity grid. The 
payment of the FiT is guaranteed for a certain period of time that is often related to the 
1
2
10.7.4.1 Overvieweconomic lifetime of the respective RE project (usually between 15-25 years). Another 
possibility is to calculate a fixed maximum amount of full-load hours of RE electricity 
production for which the FiT will be paid. FiT are usually paid by electricity grid operators, 
system or market operators, often in the context of Power Purchasing Agreements 
(PPA).
Most RE support schemes, the level of FiT is determined on the basis of a calculation 
of the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) produced from RE. This allows the RE investor 
to recover the different costs (capital, O&M, fuel, financing) while realizing a return on 
investment that depends on the assumed financing costs. In some cases, FiT has been 
calculated on the basis of avoided costs for the electricity system or the society, including 
e.g. environmental externalities such as pollution, displacement of people and loss 
of land. Thirdly, it is also possible to determine the FiT level by means of a tendering 
mechanism.
3
FiT are usually differentiated by technology to reflect the differences in generation costs 
between the various Renewable Energy (RE) technologies. A second differentiation is also 
often done for the size of the Renewable Energy project in terms of installed capacity, 
reflecting the higher generation costs of small and medium scale RE projects. Thirdly, FiT 
can be differentiated according to the RE resource quality (e.g. average wind speed; 
degree of sustainability of certification) at different project locations. In this case, FiT for 
sites with lower RE potential are higher than those for sites with a better RE potential. In 
general, these options for FiT differentiation can lead to a more heterogeneous mix of 
different RE projects (in terms of technologies, size and location) but carry the risk of 
increasing the overall costs of the support scheme (NREL 2010)8.
In many FiT schemes, RE investors are also eligible for the payment of additional bonuses 
(i.e. an increase of the basic FiT) for the use of certain biomass fuels (e.g. sustainably 
developed plantation trees; liquid manure), combined heat and power generation (CHP), 
repowering of older RE installations, provision of ancillary services to the electricity system 
or specific innovative applications (e.g. enhanced geothermal systems). On the one hand, 
these bonuses can be useful to achieve certain policy objectives (e.g. technological 
innovation), on the other hand they also increase the costs of the support scheme.
FiT are usually stable during the whole guaranteed payment period after the commissioning 
of a RE project. In some cases, a higher FiT is paid in the first years of operation and a 
lower FiT for the remaining years. This “front-loaded” FiT can facilitate the financing of 
capital-intensive RE projects. In other cases, FiT is increased on an annual basis to 
compensate for the inflation of operation and maintenance costs. 
The levels of FiT are usually determined by means of RE legislation or by national regulatory 
authorities. This means that a revision of the FiT would normally require an additional 
administrative act. Therefore, many RE support schemes have included an automatic 
degression mechanism that is applied to the FiT in regular intervals. This degression can 
be pre-determined (e.g. a fixed annual percentage reduction of the FiT) or it can be 
responsive, taking into consideration the market development for a specific RE technology.
1
2
3
4
10.7.4.2 Design OptionsFeed in Tariffs are a relatively simple RES policy instrument that provides a good third 
party code to be combined with specific design elements (in particular tariff differentiation) 
that allow a fine-tuning of the support and the achievement of different policy objectives 
(e.g. innovation, climate protection, regional development, etc.). For RES investors and 
financing institutions, the existence of FiT combined with long-term contracts guaranteed 
by the Government provides transparency, predictability and security and therefore 
contributes to towering investment risks and financing costs. The existence of FiT generally also 
contributes to a more continuous and stable RES market development. FiT provide an 
incentive to maximize the production of RES electricity because they are output-based. 
In many countries, they have proven their ability to stimulate rapid and large-scale RES 
market development as well as the development of less mature RES technologies and 
the participation of small and medium scale RES electricity producers.
The main challenge with FiT has been the definition of remuneration levels which are 
neither too low to be attractive for investments, neither too high in order to avoid 
over-compensation (“windfall profits”) and a market development that leads to the escalation 
of costs of the RE support scheme or to technical problems with the electricity system. 
Therefore, a good knowledge and monitoring of the actual costs of RE projects is required. 
In many cases, FiT have not been set at the right levels due to the problem of information 
asymmetry between the public and private sector as well as political influence during the 
FiT determination.
FiT schemes without degression have proven to have a rather slow reaction time to rapid 
changes in RE costs (e.g. the cost reductions of photovoltaic systems during the past few 
years). Even if there is a degression mechanism, the degression might be set at a level 
that does not reflect the actual development of RE costs. FiT also do not provide any 
incentive for RE operators to respond to price signals of the electricity market. Therefore, 
FiT schemes do not allow for an effective market integration of RE.
Feed in Tariffs have proven to be very effective in stimulating rapid and large- scale development 
of RES. Feed in Tariffs (FiT) and feed-in premiums (FIP) remain the most widely adopted 
renewable power generation policy employed at the national and state/provincial levels. 
As of early 2014, 73 countries and 28 states/provinces had adopted some form of FIT/FIP 
policy (REN 21 Renewables 2014 Global Status Report). This has been mainly attributed 
to the high investment security that long-term guaranteed FiT is providing.
Papua New Guinea could start with a relatively simple design, such as a technology-specific 
FiT that is based on power generation costs. Thereby, over certain time period, harness 
with technological advancement and in consideration of the economies of scale, more 
sophisticated design options could be added.
For the calculation of the degression of the RES remuneration rates, data from international 
studies with projections about the technological progress, market development and the 
evolution of the technology costs (“learning curves”) are being used. The determination of 
the right degression rate can be challenging due to uncertainties concerning the technology 
development and other important factors such as financing costs.

10.7.4.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of Feed in Tariffs10.7.5 Embedded Generation
The concept of Embedded Generation in the transmission of renewable energy leads to 
the idea of exploiting all possible renewable resources at a particular site i.e. the build 
environment, in an attempt to meet the demand load. They consist of two generating 
components, Active and Passive renewables.
Active renewables involves the direct conversion of renewable energy to electricity or 
heat e.g. wind turbines, photovoltaics, biomass generation, hydroelectric, geothermal, etc.
Passive systems on the other hand are second-hand energy, obtained from waste heat of 
PV cells, daylighting or generally energy obtained through any indirect means.
Some of the advantages of Embedded Generation include:

5-7%. This figure includes losses from the transmission lines as well as substations and the 
associated electrical components. This is seen as savings when the distance of transmission is 
reduced in embedded generation.
When the transmission distances are reduced, the construction cost of Substation, 
Transmission Towers and Right of Way would also be reduced or eliminated altogether. 
Especially in city centres where transmission is achieved through underground cables, 
there could be substantial savings involved as the cost of these cables can be 10 - 20 times 
that of overhead lines.
The environmental benefits associated with embedded generation are related to the 
reduced construction in long distance transmission (substation buildings and transmission 
towers) as they involve the clearing of land and trees. Also a benefit of embedded 
generation is the Corona Effect which is associated with overhead transmission lines. 
This involves noise disturbance and transmission interference to the surrounding 
population.
The national electricity grid is saturated with supplies from existing power generators 
and by adding in extra amounts of electricity from renewable sources, this would only 
be wasted in the form of heat. It would be better if this generated electricity is used to 
satisfy a demand load as in an embedded generation scheme and the total energy 
consumption is reduced at the point of demand.
The issue of stability and reliability of supply from the power electronics point of view 
can be improved in an embedded generation scheme as opposed to the supply of 
electricity over long distance. This is attained through shorter response time and better 
controls over the embedded systems

e]Embedded generation offers an excellent option for the transmission of energy at the local 
level and coupled with the growing interest/research in renewable energy within the build 
environment, it would make a good combination in the way energy is generated and 
transmitted in the future.
5
Supply and Demand Matching.
The ability to design the supply to match the demand as in an embedded generation 
scheme, again, would reduce unnecessary wastage as the demand profile is better 
defined for a smaller load than it is for supplying a whole region or country via the grid.

11.2 CHALLENGES
Energy efficiency and conservation refers to measures aimed at reducing energy consumption 
without sacrificing comfort, productivity or increasing costs. Energy efficiency and conservation 
measures have the potential to scale down capital investments needed to provide additional supplies 
and reduce overall resource use. It also has the potential of reducing cost of production at the end 
user level.
Energy efficiency and conservation reduces energy demand, improves energy security, improves 
competitiveness and helps to mitigate climate change by lowering GHG emissions.
A number of factors have highlighted the importance of, and urgency for, energy efficiency and 
conservation:
Inadequate awareness of the potential benefits from efficient use and utilization of energy efficiency 
and conservation practices, technology and appliances.
Consumer apathy. There is a tendency for consumers not to embrace energy efficiency and 
conservation best practices as long as there is good supply of energy for current use.
Limited use of available conservation and new technology tools with increased efficiency leads to 
From the consumer’s point of view, energy efficiency and conservation measures yield direct 
savings on the energy bill. From the national stand point, adoption of such measures would 
significantly reduce the foreign exchange costs of oil imports. It would also serve to defer additional 
investment in power generation capacity. Ultimately, improved energy efficiency would boost the 
competitiveness of PNG products owing to reduced input costs.

High energy prices - the continuing increase in the price of energy has significantly contributed 
to increased interest in energy efficiency and conservation.
Insecurity of supply - expressed in the growing discomfort about the vulnerability and 
uncertainty of future energy supplies as well as the volatility of their prices.
Adverse environmental and health impacts - there is increasing concern about spiralling 
degradation of the environment as exemplified by increased local air pollution and acid 
precipitation from ever growing fossil fuel combustion (particularly HFO). Associated with this 
are global issues such as climate change as a result of GHG emissions.
Depletion of energy resources - there is growing unease at the rate of depletion of major 
energy resources. The most used energy resources such as fuel wood and fossil fuels are 
becoming scarce as demand rises.

2212.1 BACKGROUND
Land is a critical resource in the development of energy infrastructure. However, due to competing 
interest in land utilization, the sector faces challenges in developing its infrastructure.
Environmental Management in the energy sector is key to ensuring sustainability in the energy chain. 
Energy production, transportation and use pose various dangers to human life and the environment. 
The challenge for players in the energy sector is the provision of affordable, competitive, reliable and 
sustainable energy whilst upholding people’s rights to land, environment, health and safety.
The Environmental Act 2000 is the umbrella legal framework in respect to environmental management in Papua New Guinea. Its implementing agency is the - Conservation and Environmental Protection Authority (CEPA). It recognizes a “Lead Agency” as any Government institution in which any law 
vests functions of control or management of any element of the environment or natural resource. 
Lead Agencies therefore play an important role in enforcing compliance with laws and regulations.
Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations require that mitigating measures be put in place to 
minimize the adverse impact of energy projects. Comprehensive environmental impact assessments 
are conducted for all projects prior to their implementation to ascertain the level of potential 
environmental damage, the required mitigation measures and associated costs.
Other authorities that have regulatory mandate in the energy sector in terms of environment, health 
and safety under the auspices of the Occupational Health and Safety Services (OHSS) under 
the National Health Administration Act 1997, Public Health Act 1973 and thus the Industrial Safety, 
Health and Welfare Regulation of 1965, and the Water PNG Limited respectively under the Water 
Resource Act of 1982, National Water Supply & Sewerage Act 1986 and the National Maritime Safety 
Authority (NMSA) under the Merchant Shipping Act 1975 and Merchant Shipping (Safety) Regulations 
of 1975.
Vision 2050 acknowledges that land is a vital factor of production in the economy together with its 
aesthetic, cultural and traditional values. Some key initiatives envisioned to address environmental 
problems which relate to the energy sector are:

12 AND SAFETY
The National Constitution of Papua New Guinea under Section 53 offers protection of right to 
property in which citizens are protected from unjust deprivation of their properties. Energy sector 
players, to whom land access and utilization is critical, must be aligned to this fact. In addition, The trans-boundary impact of environmental pollutants has necessitated international cooperation 
in order to prevent, minimize and mitigate pollution. A substantial portion of the risks arise from 
operations in the energy sector, amongst them transportation of petroleum products, disposal of 
hazardous waste, handling and management of radioactive materials. Several multilateral environmental 
agreements/treaties have been developed globally with Papua New Guinea ratifying and implementing 
a number of them. The Constitution provides that any treaty or convention ratified by Papua New 
Guinea forms part of the laws of Papua New Guinea. It is necessary to develop guidelines to ensure 
the application and compliance of the relevant conventions in the energy sector.

12.2 ENERGY SUPPLY SIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
12.2.1 Fossil Fuels and Renewable Energy
Exploration and production activities can have negative environmental impacts and therefore 
should be conducted in a way that protects the environment. Offshore and onshore 
exploration effects can be minimized by limiting the exploration duration and activities as 
well as employing newer technologies.
Major environment, health and safety concerns in the petroleum industry are fire outbreaks 
and oil spills. In other countries, incidences have occurred, which a number of incidents 
involving petroleum products has led to loss of life and property. However, Papua New Guinea 
can avoid such accidents through adoption of international best practices in handling safety 
concerns in the sub-sector and ensuring strict compliance and enforcement of the regulations.
Personnel handling petroleum products are exposed to the risks associated with inhalation of 
product fumes and thermal contact. These concerns can be addressed through use of high 
standard equipment and repeated use of personal protective equipment.
Concerns in the coal industry as experienced by coal-producing countries include emissions 
which contribute to global warming and acid rain. However, if Papua New Guinea harnesses 
and develops coal, modern technologies such as Clean Coal Technology (CCT) can be 
applied to reduce pollution significantly.
Clean coal energy can be harnessed chemically without combustion with air by capturing 
99% of Carbon Dioxide (C02).
Generally, renewable energy is considered as an environmentally friendly option for energy 
development. However, some concerns exist raising the need for mitigation measures to be 
incorporated in projects to ensure minimal impact and also ensure sustainability.
Geothermal power generation involves drawing fluids at high temperature from deep in the 
earth. These fluids carry a mixture of gases which contribute to global warming, acid rain, 
and noxious smells if released.

and healthy environment, thus the Constitution also declares that sustainable development amongst 
the values and principles of governance which bind all State agencies, officials and any person 
implementing public policy.The major concern for large hydros is the displacement of people and wildlife where a reservoir 
is located. Large reservoirs result in submersion of extensive areas upstream, destroying 
ecologically rich and productive land, riverine valley forests, marshlands and grasslands.
Dams also have an impact on aquatic ecosystems both upstream and downstream by 
disrupting the reproductive cycle, e.g. fish whose spawning grounds are normally upstream. 
Submerged vegetation - decomposes anaerobically producing methane, a potent 
greenhouse gas multiple times worse than C02. Other risks of hydros include dam failure 
which may be caused by sabotage, or structural failures, and siltation. Appropriate mitigation 
measures should be adopted to counter these and other potential negative effects.
exhaust. In addition, the practice of re-injecting these fluids into the earth in order to 
stimulate production helps to reduce the environmental risk. Other mitigation measures 
include extraction of excess materials for industrial use.
Use of indigenous forest for biomass has significant negative environmental impact in the form of 
deforestation so needs to be avoided.
Biomass development that utilise newly developed plantations in a sustainable manner should be 
encouraged, particularly if internationally certified as sustainable.
The construction and operation of electricity projects have a direct impact on the quality of the 
environment either by the emission or discharge of pollutants, poor waste handling, or by changing 
the ecological systems. The degree of pollution and other ecological impacts are dependent upon 
the nature of the technology in use as well as the size and the general location of the plant.
A health and safety concern with electricity grid systems and consumer installations is the danger 
of electrocution and electric shocks. Electricity also has the potential to significantly improve the 
quality of life so needs to be balanced by other concerns.
The global, traditional challenge of nuclear energy remains the management of radioactive waste. 
However, as a result of continued research in the area, radioactive waste management is now 
well within manageable levels. Spent fuel rods can either be safely stored until the radioactive 
levels reduce to non-toxic levels or be reprocessed and reused in generation of nuclear energy.
The waste also requires special handling and storage facilities to reduce the risk of exposure to 
employees, the public and the environment.
A nuclear meltdown may cause release of radioactive materials which can have a negative 
impact to environment, health and safety of persons. However, further research has led 
to development of advanced reactors with enhanced security and safety mechanisms that 
greatly diminish the possibility of a nuclear accident.

12.4 CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES
Some solid fuels or biomass fuels are less efficient than oil, natural gas or LPG. It can take larger 
quantities of peat, wood, or coal to do the job and they will produce larger quantities of smoke 
when they are burned. Solid fuels produce less heat for the amount of fuel consumed and produce 
more pollution. This is described as the energy ladder.
The conversion efficiency of modern biomass power plants is approximately the same as that of 
gas turbine altitudes observed in much of Papua New Guinea. In addition, modern biomass power 
plant technology results in less smoke and much less other pollution than liquid fuel sources such 
as oil, diesel or fuel oil.
Some solid fuels lead to increased indoor air pollution which leads to Upper Respiratory Tract 
Infections (URTI). The challenge is to move consumers up the energy ladder recognizing that 
biomass, which is at the bottom of energy ladder provides 60% of cooking energy needs in Papua 
New Guinea.
Kerosene is widely used in households for lighting and cooking, mainly by rural masses in the 
country. In 2008 about 300 thousand cubic metres were used, up from 200 thousand cubic metres 
consumed in 2003 according to the UN Human Development Indictor. However, this causes indoor 
air pollution leading to cases of URTI, in addition to the risk of explosions of lamps and stoves 
leading to injuries, loss of lives and property. There is need to move consumers from the consumption 
of kerosene to LPG and natural gas.
PNG Biomass has an initiative where it is rolling out low-smoke wood-fired cooking stoves which 
can also provide electricity and light, and be used to charge portable electronic devices such as 
mobile phones.
Papua New Guinea was a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty signed in 1997, to lower 
anthropogenic emissions of Carbon Dioxide (C02). However, Papua New Guinea is not among the 
Annex I countries, which have emission reduction targets since its emissions are low - compared 
to emissions from developed (Annex I) countries and MDCs and LDCs. However, under the protocol, 
there are opportunities to benefit by selling Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) through the 
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Papua New Guinea has developed a National Strategy 
on Climate Change.
Although Papua New Guinea has ratified the Kyoto Protocol, it has not benefited much from the 
CDM since potential projects may have not been approved, developed or fully made operational, 
though, the projects proposals may have been submitted for consideration under CDM.
With such results of whether, there are investments and or not being proposed, approved and 
developed, on a scale of between 100 points (highest) and 0 points (lowest), Papua New Guinea 
is rated to have an ‘inadequate’ climate for CDM investment. It however needs to move from 
‘Satisfactory’ to ‘Good’ categories to improve opportunities to attract investments.

312.5 DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND MITIGATION
12.6 LAND AND SOCIO-ECONOMlC IMPACTS
Natural disasters may be triggered by adverse weather and climate conditions, whereas 
manmade disasters may be due to sabotage, human error or technological failure. Government 
therefore recognizes the need to establish appropriate disaster preparedness and mitigation 
mechanism within the energy sector.
The following hazards are a constant threat that must be taken into consideration in planning 
and management of the energy sector:
The challenges are mainly in setting up and making operational capacity for disaster preparedness, 
management and mitigation. However, this can be addressed through proper disaster preparedness 
and management mechanisms and practices.

Climate and weather hazards including floods and droughts.
Geophysical hazards including earthquakes, faults, volcanic eruptions, subsidence, landslides, 
blowouts and mud flows.
Environmental hazards including soil erosion, siltation and desertification.
Industrial accidents, oil spills, human negligence, sabotage can occur through terrorism and 
other deliberate acts and infrastructural systems failure.
Energy development projects have various impacts on communities where the projects are 
implemented. Key among these is both economic and physical displacement. Physical displacement 
of project affected people is particularly prevalent in projects such as hydro power plants 
requiring water reservoirs, acquisition of way leaves during construction of transmission lines 
and pipelines. Others include the concern by local communities that they will not benefit from 
these projects.
Absence of a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) Framework: Currently, all projects receiving 
support by World Bank or IFC are required to develop RAPs. These should be replicated for 
all projects and a national framework developed. The State shall develop Resettlement Plan 
Framework for all hydro projects that causes shifting and relocation of settlements.
Access to and acquisition of land: Difficulty in the acquisition of sites, way leaves, rights of 
way and easements to facilitate energy infrastructure development is an impediment to fast 
tracking the improvement and upgrading of the energy systems. Further, legal and regulatory 
provisions in the energy sector governing land acquisition and access are inadequate. The 
State shall pursue all avenues to secure land through outright purchase or long term lease from 
the landowner for purposes related to the projects including right of way and establishment of 
infrastructures of the hydro projects.

to planning and administration of land in the country. The National Land Commission and the 
Land Titles Commission is to ensure that planning for utility services and public private 
infrastructure under Land Act 1996 and Physical Planning Act 1989 for State Leases and Land 
Titles Commission Act 1962 and Land Group Incorporation Act 1974 respectively on customary 
land, includes planning for energy utility services namely way-leaves, infrastructure development, 
transmission, distribution and pipeline corridors.
Make provision for waivers in respect to any charges for utilization of resources owned by other 
public bodies critical to the development of energy infrastructure and service provision such 
as way-leaves, easements and rights of way. Any compensation for interest in land under the 
Land Act 1996, Land Group Incorporation Act 1974 and Section 54 of the Constitution shall

this provision all activities in the catchment are regulated.
Empower the institution that administers controlled catchment regulating to prosecute 
personnel or agencies that contravene the controlled catchment provisions.
The Government shall make it mandatory that Cumulative Impact Assessment be undertaken 
by developers of small hydros to minimise and mitigate destruction to catchment areas.
Strengthen existing emergency institutions to specifically deal with Energy disasters.
Using climate, weather information and data, the maximization of safety factor for hydro 
dams, power stations, geothermal power stations, fuel oils depots, and petroleum 
production areas should be taken on board in all future developments. This is especially 
so in areas with high risk and/or high hazard rating.

hydrology to the sector’s core activities.
Develop mechanisms for provision of security for all energy installations including weather, 
climate and environment monitoring installations, which shall be treated as national 
protected zones.
The sector will develop information and database on weather, climate and hydrological 
factors at national level and at specific site levels.

Information Base: The sector will develop information and a database on weather 
and climate factors at national level and at specific site levels. Specific sites here refer to sites that continually understudy the interaction between weather and climate 
on the system and other stress monitors that relay vulnerability. One important factor 
here is accuracy of information and reliability.
Risk zoning: Zoning and mapping helps to enhance of evaluation risk and vulnerability. 
Risk mapping shall be a continuous exercise updating risk assessment results in the 
maps and subsequent zoning.
Disaster response plans: Using the information on climate and weather and risk 
prone points of a system, detailed disaster response plans will mitigate vulnerability. 
The plans shall include rapid reaction activity plans and initial attack or emergency 
steps.
Disaster plans and costing centres: Up to date disaster management plans are key 
in reducing risk and vulnerability.

13.1 OVERVIEW
Since PNG achieved its Independence in 1975 a coherent National Energy Policy was non-existent. 
The National Energy Policy was eventually workshopped in March 2006, this followed on 
from an AusAid funded technical assistance ( TA) facility called AusAid Advisory Service Facility 
(ASF) II and was part of the GoPNG ongoing Public Sector Reform in September 2003.
Despite several such reviews in the past by various organizations such as AusAid in 2006, 
Secretariat of The Pacific Community (SPC) in 2009, and DPE in 2006 very little progress 
occurred. The aim of the National Energy Policy was to merge all aspects of energy planning 
and delivery in a rationale and coordinated manner. The long term objective now is to establish 
an overarching National Energy Policy with an Energy Plan in order to deliver the Government’s 
aspirations on national development. This will be in consistent with the MDG, the DSP 2010 to 
2030 and Vision 2050.
While the SPC study reviewed the PNG’s Energy Security, the ASFII reviewed the following objectives:
The Division of Energy had also gone through three (3) decades of transition and transformation 
to what is now the Energy Wing of the Department of Petroleum and Energy. It was established 
in 1997 as Department of Energy Development with the following mandate;
The Department of Energy Development (DED) however, was abolished in 1995 and transformed 
into an Office of Energy Development within Department of Mining and Petroleum (DMP). When 
the Department of Petroleum and Energy was established after the abolishment of the Department

13 ARRANGEMENTDivision of Energy but retained most of its function of 1997 with additional functional responsibilities such 
as the formulation and implementation of the National Energy Policy as well as promotion of 
non-fossil and renewable energy.
Following the National Executive Council (NEC) Decision No. NG 141 of 2011 endorsement of 
the Electricity Industry Policy (EIP) these led to the establishment of Energy Wing, which was 
then mandated to undertake the technical regulatory functions of the electricity industry in the 
country. This will require the establishment of four (4) Regional offices located in Port Moresby 
(Southern Region), Lae (Momase), Mt. Hagen (Highlands Region), and Kokopo (NGI Region). 
This will enable the transfer of the technical regulatory functions of PPL to DPE Energy Wing, 
with consultations from the Independent Consumer Competition Commission (ICCC). Furthermore 
the Energy wing has been directed to formulate and implement the National Electrification 
Rollout Plan (NEROP) for the country in an endeavor to meet the 70 percent electrification access 
by households by year 2030 under the Development Strategic Plan (DSP) and Vision 2050.
Note: NEC Decision 145 of 2013 of 3rd of May directed the abolishing of the Department of Petroleum and Energy and creation of the Petroleum and Energy Authority was not implemented. 
The Ministerial Determinations G615/2017 was also not implemented.
Several additional responsibilities of the Energy Wing are as follows:
These therefore indicate and highlight the fact that the Energy Wing’s responsibilities covers 
both midstream to downstream aspects of petroleum production, supply and consumption in PNG.

Monitor, review and provide recommendations on fuel pricing, electricity tariffs , and Government 
charges and subsidies, in order to ensure that the full and correct prices signals are conveyed 
to consumers when convenient.
Negotiate, develop and maintain its capacity to monitor and evaluate the equivalent landed 
price of petroleum products, the petroleum company costs elements, the pricing formula and 
Government charges so as to negotiate and maintain equitable pricing and proper contractual 
arrangements for petroleum products.

13.2 PROPOSED INSTITUTIONS
The institutional arrangements of the energy sector will be streamlined to encourage efficiency, 
access and affordabitity of electricity to domestic, commercial and industrial users. The energy 
regulatory functions, both technical as well as economic will be brought under the proposed 
National Energy Authority.
The proposal for the establishment of the NEA emanates from the Government’s decision to 
create a new Ministry of Communication Information Technology and Energy.
The establishment of the Ministry means that a new Energy Policy and institutional arrangements 
supporting this policy must be established. The Department of Petroleum and Energy must be 
re-structured in order to build institutional capacity to manage the midstream to downstream 
activities of the Petroleum sector, as part of the overall National Energy Policy and Rural

313.3 RESOURCING OF NEA AND ENERCOM
Initially the NEA would require establishment cost to be borne by the Government under a 
bridging fund arrangement until the Authority is self-financing.
Part of this transition and establishment cost will include redundancy and recruitment.
The operational cost will come from normal government budgetary appropriation.
The revenue for the NEA will initially come from licensing, regulation fees and other revenue 
measures within this policy framework.
The NEA and its subsidiaries will proactively participate, engage or be involved in commercial 
arrangements including but not limited to Joint Ventures (JV), Public Private Partnership (PPP) 
and projects with Provinces and Districts to implement government policies.
The NEA to be the Chief Implementer of Energy Projects in consultation with other relevant 
Government Agencies and Development Partners.
In the long term the NEA should endeavor to use and develop state of the art technology to 
develop new energy products for local and international markets.
The Department of Petroleum and Energy will be restructured into the following entities:
For capacity and financial reasons, ENERCOM will initially be housed under NEA until it assumes 
all regulatory functions.
ENERCOM should then be established as a separate entity to protect its mandate as a regulator 
for energy.
