REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY
AN AGENDA FOR ACTION AND
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT
Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy
Monrovia, Liberia
May 2009FOREWORD
Energy impacts all aspects of life. It impacts the quality of education and health, the welfare of women and 
children, and the environment. It drives economic growth and sustainable development. 
Therefore, the provision of modern, reliable, affordable, and environmentally sustainable energy services is 
crucial to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and Liberia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy.
The formulation of this National Energy Policy (NEP), Liberia’s first, started in early 2006 with provisions in 
the 150-Day Plan deliverables and followed with a National Energy Stakeholders Forum in October 2006, the 
publication of the National Energy Sector White Paper, the interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Process, and 
the full Poverty Reduction Strategy.
The NEP contains our national vision in the energy sector, from the emergency phase, which is nearing 
completion, through the capacity building and development phases.
Through the NEP we hope to lay the foundation for the creation of an enabling environment to attract 
private sector capital to the energy sector, to restructure and reform energy institutions, to decentralize energy 
service administration, to fully utilize domestic energy resources and, most importantly, to ensure that all 
parts of Liberia have access to affordable and modern energy services.
The bedrock of this NEP is our national experience, the ECOWAS Energy Protocol and the collective global 
efforts to combat climate change events. As our contribution to ongoing global initiatives to mitigate where 
possible and to adapt where necessary the adverse impact of climate change due to emission of greenhouse 
gases, we are making a policy declaration in this NEP to drive Liberia towards a carbon neutral economy by 
2050.
The challenges to achieve these objectives are nevertheless enormous, but it is the intention of the 
Government to use the NEP as the strategic blueprint for the implementation of its energy development 
programs.
We kindly request the cooperation of all Liberians as we provide “small light today, big light tomorrow.”

The National Energy Policy (NEP) is the product of an extensive process of consultations that started with 
the National Energy Stakeholders Forum (NESF) in October 2006. Recommendations from that forum were 
summarized in the National Energy Sector White Paper published in February 2007. After a process of 
scrutiny and validation involving all key stakeholders, the White Paper has now been transformed into the 
NEP. 
The principal objective of the National Energy Policy is to ensure universal access to modern energy 
services in an affordable, sustainable and environmentally-friendly manner in order to foster the 
economic, political, and social development of Liberia.
Energy is an essential service that impacts all aspects of life. Consequently there is a direct correlation 
between a nation’s level of development and its energy consumption patterns. Reflecting the country’s underdeveloped economy, Liberia’s present energy production and use is dominated by the household energy 
sector whose mainstay is traditional biomass energy resources. In 2004, it was estimated that over 95% of the 
population depends on firewood and charcoal for cooking and heating needs and palm oil for lighting. 
Modern energy services based on electricity and petroleum products are predominantly used for economic 
production and transportation. In the household sector, the use of modern energy services consists mainly of 
kerosene, electricity, and liquefied petroleum gas for lighting, cooking, and entertainment. These are used by 
higher income households in urban areas.
Addressing chronic poverty is the fundamental challenge of the Government of Liberia (GOL). The 
Government’s overall vision and strategies for poverty reduction are outlined in the Poverty Reduction 
Strategy (PRS) for the period July 2008 to June 2011 which builds upon the 150-Day Plan of January 2006 
and the interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Process (IPRSP) for the period July 2006 to June 2008. Both 
documents are built on four pillars – (1) consolidating peace and security; (2) revitalizing the economy; (3) 
strengthening governance and the rule of law; and (4) rehabilitating infrastructure and delivering basic 
services. The development of the NEP is an essential exercise towards the realization of the goals and 
objectives of the PRS as well as contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs).
The NEP assumes the implementation of proposed energy sector reforms founded on three essential 
features: (1) demonstrating the Government’s resolve for good governance and ensuring financial 
transparency in all sector transactions; (2) overcoming the significant obstacles to private sector investment in 
energy supply; and (3) creating the requisite institutional and legal framework and an independent regulatory 
regime. In undertaking energy sector reform, the Government will also be addressing a key component of 
Liberia’s commitment to the World Bank and other donors for debt relief under the program for Highly 
Indebted Poor Countries.
KEY POLICY ISSUES
The NEP addresses the following strategic issues that are implied in the principal policy objective – access, 
quality, cost, and institutional framework. These issues refer to the need for the various technologies and 
delivery options for energy products and services to be available, acceptable, affordable, and adequate. 
ACCESS
The policy objective is to ensure availability of modern energy services for all Liberians, in both the 
urban and rural areas.Currently, about 10% of urban residents and less than 2% of rural residents have electricity access largely 
from self-generation using expensive imported fuel. By 2015, in line with the Millennium Development Goals 
as adopted by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Government expects to 
achieve the following goals:
40% of Liberian citizens living in rural and peri-urban areas and using traditional biomass for 
cooking shall have access to improved stoves and kerosene or efficient-gas cookers in order to 
reduce indoor pollution; 
30% of the urban and peri-urban population shall have access to reliable modern energy services 
enabling them to meet their basic needs (lighting, cooking, communication, and small productionrelated activities); 
15% of the rural population and 25% of the schools, clinics, and community centers in rural areas 
shall have access to modern energy services to meet the same basic needs.
Beyond 2015, the long-term strategy is to make Liberia a carbon neutral country by 2050. The GOL will seek 
to leverage the country’s biomass and water resources as sources of carbon credits for energy development. 
The GOL will promote the use of renewable energy such as solar and wind systems in power plants and all 
large commercial facilities such as supermarkets, hotels, restaurants, entertainment centers, hospitals, and 
large retail shops and stores. The GOL through the new dedicated Rural and Rural Energy Agency will 
vigorously pursue the development of mini and micro hydro on the country’s numerous rivers and streams.
It is the policy of the GOL to ensure the availability of quality petroleum products on a cost recoverable, 
competitive, and affordable basis throughout the nation. In the long term substitute renewable sources such 
as biodiesel will be employed as fuel for transportation.
QUALITY
The policy objective is to ensure acceptability of energy products and services by adopting standards 
that are consistent with international best practice.
The GOL shall establish quality standards for all energy products and services which will be monitored and 
enforced by the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) and the Bureau of Standards as appropriate; standards will 
be established to ensure accuracy of meters and gauges, product safety, security, reliability, consistency, purity,
and availability as well as timeliness in responding to stakeholder service requests.
The GOL shall also establish energy efficiency standards for all government and commercial buildings and 
industrial facilities and for importation of fuel-efficient vehicles and energy-efficient light bulbs and home 
appliances. 
It is the policy of the GOL to minimize and eliminate loss, theft, and corruption and to promote international 
best practices in wholesale and retail energy transactions and in the granting of licenses and concessions. 
COST
The policy objective is to ensure affordability through least-cost production and utilization of energy 
services.
Cost is the main determinant of energy access and quality. It is therefore the policy of the GOL that the 
development and utilization of all forms of energy shall be done on a least-cost basis. Financial, economic, 
social, and environmental costs shall all be taken into consideration. The GOL supports the collective global 
effort to control harmful greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change and will seek to balance 
the environmental costs and benefits of all energy programs. The GOL expects to achieve its access goals for 
2015 while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 10%, improving energy efficiency by 20%, raising the share of renewable energy to 30% of electricity production and 10% of overall energy consumption, and increasing 
the level of biofuels in transport fuel to 5%.
The GOL is committed to the provision of energy services on a full cost-recovery basis to those who are able 
to pay and on a targeted subsidized basis to those who can only afford to pay a portion of the cost. This 
approach will ensure the long-term financial viability of energy service companies while ensuring the 
affordability of all energy forms for poor consumers. Prices will be set by the operators subject to costs 
allowed by the Energy Regulatory Board and principles set by the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy 
(MLME) to ensure universal access. The Government will establish a regulatory process for monitoring all 
costs – economic, financial, social, and environmental – and allocating these to the user (rate payer or 
polluter) or public (taxpayer) as appropriate.
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
The policy objective is to establish an adequate delivery process for energy products and services 
through a public and private partnership where investment in new infrastructure and services is 
provided by the private sector to the greatest extent possible, with the public sector providing the 
supporting policy environment as well as regulatory oversight.
The establishment of an independent and transparent regulatory process will be essential for the creation of 
an investment environment conducive to increased private sector involvement in the energy sector. To 
achieve independence and transparency, the institutional framework must avoid conflicts of interest 
and overlapping roles by separating policy setting, regulatory oversight, and policy implementation 
and operations.
The Government, through the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy, will define and review energy policy. 
The Energy Regulatory Board will monitor policy implementation by all operators, whether owned by the 
public sector, private sector, or local communities.
For the better exercise of its functions, the GOL will reorganize the MLME to elevate the attention given to 
energy and its many uses and benefits. It shall be the policy of the GOL to ensure that the Ministry’s 
Department of Energy (DoE) is organized efficiently and resourced adequately to discharge its oversight role 
over all the different energy sub-sectors as well as to direct and supervise, through policy making and 
planning, the efficient development of the energy sector as a whole.
It shall be the policy of the GOL to balance the interests of consumers with those of firms engaged in the 
importation, production, transportation, distribution, and sale of energy products and services through the 
creation of an autonomous regulatory body, enabled by legislation, to eliminate distortions in energy-related 
markets through transparent, predictable and stable oversight; the Energy Regulatory Board shall be 
responsible for monitoring all energy policies and standards established by the MLME.
It shall be the policy of the GOL to facilitate and accelerate the economic transformation of rural Liberia by 
establishing a semi-autonomous agency dedicated to the commercial development and supply of modern 
energy services to rural areas with an emphasis on locally available renewable resources. The agency, to be 
called the Rural and Renewable Energy Agency (RREA), will have an operational role under the oversight of 
the ERB and the policy direction of the MLME. The RREA’s mandate will include integrating energy into 
rural development planning; promotion of renewable energy technologies; facilitating delivery of energy 
products and services through rural energy service companies (RESCOs) and community initiatives; and 
facilitating the funding of rural energy projects including managing a Rural Energy Fund (REFUND) that will 
provide low interest loans, loan guarantees, and grants as targeted subsidies to ensure access by the poor.
It is the policy of the GOL that for the foreseeable future Government-owned energy corporations shall 
continue to operate but shall be restructured to remove all policy making and policy monitoring functions 
and to improve operational performance through sound commercial business practices. The restructuring of 
the MLME and the establishment of the ERB and RREA will necessitate changes to the legislation establishing the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC), National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL), and 
Liberia Petroleum Refining Corporation (LPRC). Pending the review and revision of the legislation, the 
policy setting and monitoring functions currently being conducted by NOCAL, LPRC, and LEC staff will be 
transferred to the appropriate offices of the MLME, ERB, and the Bureau of Standards.
LEC shall be the national grid company with special responsibility to provide support and advice to the 
MLME on national power system expansion planning. Although LEC will, to some extent, be involved in 
distribution, the Government is considering other options, including private sector operation and ownership 
of the Monrovia power distribution business. The Government will encourage and support investment in the 
power sector by independent power producers (IPPs) and independent power transmission and power 
distribution companies (IPTs and IPDs). The Government will also encourage large commercial and 
industrial facilities to utilize co-generation schemes and to increase the scale of their power sources to provide 
power for neighboring communities.
In the petroleum sector the Government shall establish the Liberia National Oil Corporation (LNOC) as the 
Government’s implementing agency for both the upstream and downstream operations. The LNOC shall be 
created from a merger of the operations of NOCAL and LPRC that are not transferred to the MLME or 
ERB. For upstream operations, the policy of the GOL is to bring the country’s investment climate in line 
with international best practice so that the extraction of petroleum resources will benefit all Liberians and the 
exploration and development will be conducted in an environmentally friendly manner. The GOL, with 
technical and operational assistance from LNOC’s upstream operations department, shall establish a fully 
transparent and accountable process for petroleum exploration and commercial development, with regulatory 
oversight by the ERB. For downstream operations, the GOL, with technical and operational assistance from 
LNOC’s downstream operations department, shall support competitive private sector investment or 
participation in new storage depot management or ownership, port management, off-loading facilities for 
petroleum products, up-country storage depots, tankers moving petroleum products around the country, and 
in construction and operation of a refinery primarily devoted to exports.
It is the policy of the GOL to link its long-term energy policy with that of the ECOWAS region. The 
ECOWAS Energy Protocol constitutes a key building block of Liberia’s national energy policy. For this 
reason, Liberia’s goals on energy access are in line with the ECOWAS goals and will move the country toward 
achieving the 2015 Millennium Development Goals. Liberia will establish a Saint Paul River Authority
(SPRA), modeled on the US Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for the development of its large-scale 
hydropower potential to fuel the economy and to export power to the West African Power Pool (WAPP).
Liberia will also join the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP) and encourage electricity developers in 
neighboring countries to use this gas for power generation which can then be transmitted to Liberia.
The GOL recognizes that there are areas of overlap and inter-linkage between energy and other sectors and it 
is therefore necessary to re-establish the National Energy Committee (NEC), in place before the civil crisis, to 
facilitate coordination between energy-oriented organizations in the public and private sector and developers 
and users of related infrastructure services. The NEC will also provide a forum for coordination among 
domestic, regional, and international stakeholders. The NEC will therefore fulfill the ECOWAS 
recommendations for member countries to set up a cross-sectoral and multi-actor cooperation mechanism 
equipped with the human, technical, and financial resources required to discharge its coordination mandate.
SMALL LIGHT TODAY, BIG LIGHT TOMORROW
The policy objective is to establish and communicate a strategic roadmap that will serve as a 
reference for performance measurement in the implementation of the NEP.
The Government has adopted a three-pronged strategy towards the realization of the vision expressed by the 
principal objective of the NEP – the short term (emergency phase), the medium term (capacity building 
phase) and the long term (development phase). President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, in the dedication ceremony for the re-establishment of public power supply in Monrovia, summarized the strategic roadmap with the 
phrase “Small light today, big light tomorrow.” This NEP paves the way from the small light to the big light.
The emergency phase was launched in January 2006 as a cornerstone of Liberia’s post-conflict stabilization 
and redevelopment program. During this phase, several pilot projects have been implemented to serve as the 
foundation for the rebuilding of the country. The projects have also served to provide lessons for the 
development of the NEP. Over the medium term, from 2008 to 2015, the strategy is to develop the country’s 
institutional capacity for policy implementation. During this phase, the Government will roll out and extend 
the emergency phase pilot projects and also facilitate the first major private sector investments in power 
generation. The long term, beyond 2015, will have the objective of vision realization and will be focused on 
the development of the country’s large hydropower and other renewable resources. 1. INTRODUCTION
The Government of Liberia is faced with the mammoth task of rebuilding a nation devastated by 14 years of 
civil strife. The Government has articulated its vision and major strategies for social and economic 
development in the 150-Day Plan for the period immediately following the inauguration of President Ellen 
Johnson Sirleaf in January 2006, the interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Process for the period July 2006 to 
June 2008, and the Poverty Reduction Strategy for the period July 2008 to June 2011. All of these have been 
organized around four pillars – (1) consolidating peace and security; (2) revitalizing the economy;
(3) strengthening governance and the rule of law; and (4) rehabilitating infrastructure and delivering basic 
services. The objective is to lay the foundation for sustained and equitable growth, poverty reduction, and the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals – a global initiative, with time-bound (2015) and 
measurable goals and targets for combating poverty, hunger, illiteracy, gender inequality, disease, and 
environmental degradation.
In the formulation of its development plans the Government has recognized that increased access to modern 
energy services by both the urban and rural population is one of the keys for accelerating the reconstruction 
and economic revitalization of the country and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 
Energy impacts all aspects of life – health, education, economic growth, welfare of women and children, and 
the environment. Energy is therefore crucial for the achievement of the four pillars of the Poverty Reduction 
Strategy as well as the MDGs. 
To transform the Government’s vision for development into reality with tangible impact on the lives of 
Liberia’s citizens, the Government has formulated the National Energy Policy to detail the actions required to 
enable the country’s energy sector to play its strategic supporting role. The challenges involved are immense 
and should not be underestimated. The Government inherited a situation where there was no public 
electricity infrastructure or functioning utility, the petroleum company was looted and destroyed, petroleum 
exploration was at a standstill, and there was no coordinated energy policy and strategy. Nevertheless, it is 
imperative to be systematic and disciplined about energy policy and strategy implementation if the energy 
sector’s potential and President Johnson Sirleaf’s vision are to be realized. The reform of the energy sector is 
also a key component of Liberia’s commitment to the World Bank and other donors for debt relief under the 
program for Highly Indebted Poor Countries.
The NEP reaffirms the Government’s conviction that economic 
development is impossible without access to reliable, accessible, and 
affordable energy. Increased commercial energy access and use will 
contribute to the growth of Liberia’s economy and improved quality 
of life for Liberia’s citizens. Secure energy supplies and basic 
infrastructure are essential for Liberia’s economic transformation. 
Adequate and reliable energy supply will allow the mining sector, 
industries, and commercial concerns to expand their production and 
sales of goods and services, and in turn increase employment. For the 
rural poor in the agriculture sector, modern energy access means 
increased productivity through improved production and processing 
methods, increased employment, and preservation of crops.
The process and commitment to develop this NEP and to commence meaningful energy sector reform grew 
out of the National Energy Stakeholders Forum held in Monrovia in October 2006. The two-day forum, 
attended by nearly 300 stakeholders from all parts of Liberia, provided an opportunity for evaluating local 
realities and experiences. The results of the NESF were then compiled into a National Energy Sector White 
Paper published by the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy in February 2007. The White Paper contains 
various policy recommendations for the reform of the electricity and petroleum sub-sectors and examines 
Energy empowers development 
by enhancing the creativity and 
productivity of human capital. 
Modern energy can support the 
effective delivery of health and 
education services, increase 
labor productivity, and alleviate 
the disproportionate burden on 
women for water, food, and fuel 
supply.strategies to harness Liberia’s tremendous renewable resources to extend modern energy services to the 
nation’s rural population. 
Using the White Paper, and taking account of regional and international best practices, a draft policy 
document was then developed. Three policy validation workshops were convened to provide the key 
stakeholders the opportunity to review and confirm the policy proposals before final drafting and publishing 
of the NEP. The validation workshops were held in Zwedru, Gbargna, and Monrovia and the combined 
attendance was nearly 450 delegates and observers. These were drawn from national and international 
stakeholders, many of whom were participants in the NESF and are active or interested in ensuring energy 
access for both urban and rural Liberians. They included senior policy and decision makers at the national, 
county, and district level as well as representatives of government agencies, utilities, financial institutions, 
development agencies, consultants, community, youth, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
KEY POLICY ISSUES
In the keynote address to the NESF, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf elucidated the following principles as the 
foundation of Liberia’s new National Energy Policy:
Leveraging enhanced energy access for improvements in education, health, and economic development;
Providing access to modern energy (fuels and electricity) for previously neglected rural consumers;
Enhancing transparency and accountability at every stage of energy operations: wholesale and retail
transactions; granting of petroleum leases, electricity concessions, and other management contracts; 
collection of payments from consumers; the granting of licenses to providers of energy services throughout 
the economy; and timely adjudication of cases of official corruption, power theft, and the adulteration of 
petroleum products and lubricants;
Ensuring the long-term financial viability of electric utilities and other energy companies;
Ensuring the affordability of all energy forms for poor consumers;
Balancing the environmental costs and benefits of all energy programs, taking into account the collective 
global effort to control harmful greenhouse gases responsible for climate change;
Maximizing energy efficiency and demand-side management (DSM) to minimize the financial and 
environmental costs of energy development;
Ensuring the involvement of the private sector to the “greatest degree possible” throughout the energy 
sector; and
Ensuring that Liberia takes all requisite actions (political, economic, technical) on a timely basis to integrate 
its domestic energy policies into the ECOWAS Protocol and attendantly, the West African Power Pool, the 
West African Gas Pipeline, and other planned or existing international commitments, standards, and 
obligations.
These principles provide a “vision” for moving Liberia’s economy and social sectors forward on the basis of 
universal access to affordable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly modern energy services. They address 
the following four strategic issues and objectives:
Access – The issue is the availability of energy products and services and the objective is to 
achieve growth with equity, ensuring that every urban and rural household, economic enterprise,
and social and administrative center has access to modern energy services. Clearly, the expansion of 
energy supply and delivery systems must remain the Government’s most critical near-term priority, given 
the energy and economic deprivation of many of Liberia’s citizens. It should be noted, however, that Private Investment, Improved Access

access depends on a trade-off between quality and cost – the minimum acceptable standards and the 
willingness and ability to pay.
Quality – The issue is the acceptability of energy products and services and the objective is to 
emulate international best practice in terms of product and service standards as well as 
management and regulatory practices. The Government commits to recruitment procedures for key 
policy and subordinate positions based solely on professional merit. In all cases, the public trust must be 
protected and honored by all; corruption will not be tolerated in any form.
Cost – The issue is the affordability of energy products and services and the objective is to 
minimize economic, financial, social, and environmental costs in order to ensure a balance 
between the interests of investors, consumers, and the general public. The Government is 
committed to providing energy services on a full cost-recovery basis to those who are able to pay and on a 
targeted subsidized basis to those who can only afford to pay a portion of the cost. Where subsidies are 
required, they shall only be used for capital and not operational or consumption expenditures.
Institutional framework – The issue is the adequacy or capacity for energy delivery and the 
objective is to create a partnership between the public and private sectors which results in the 
involvement of the private sector to the greatest extent possible. The Government pledges to 
establish an efficient, transparent, productive energy sector based on a strong policy, legal, and regulatory 
framework that ensures equitable treatment of all stakeholders. Quite simply, the Government does not 
have adequate budgetary resources to develop the energy infrastructure to deliver modern energy to 
Liberia’s people. Private resources must be attracted to Liberia’s energy sector, and that investment will not 
be realized without adoption of appropriate reforms. Private investment will free up public-sector 
resources for other pressing national social priorities (health, education, housing, sanitation). Of equal 
importance is the need to ensure that the implementation of new policies does not overburden the limited 
technical, human, and financial resources available to the energy sector and damage Liberia’s fragile 
economy.
The realization of these policy objectives requires the Government to create an enabling environment built 
on the following three essential features. (1) Demonstrating the Government’s resolve for good 
governance and ensuring financial transparency in all sector transactions: transparency improves 
efficiency and provides a level playing field by 
ensuring that the same information and access to 
decision makers are available to all market 
participants; transparency also provides assurance to 
potential investors that all participants in the energy 
sector are treated equitably. (2) Overcoming the 
significant obstacles to private sector investment 
in energy supply: perceptions of political risk or a 
lack of purchasing power discourage energy sector 
investors from considering Liberia as a place for 
undertaking projects. To remedy that, the 
Government needs to alter the factual bases giving 
rise to those perceptions and to improve the 
knowledge base available to potential energy sector 
investors so as to allow them to make informed, 
positive decisions in favor of undertaking Liberian 
projects. The development of this NEP is part of the process of communication to foster positive investor 
perception. (3) Creating the requisite institutional and legal framework and independent regulatory 
regime: four essential features must be built into any successful enabling program for energy sector reform.
These are: (i) industry restructuring to create conditions to introduce competition, increase transparency, and 
mobilize investment finance; (ii) promoting private sector participation by providing incentives for greater efficiency and tapping into new sources of finance; (iii) adopting the principle of cost-reflective pricing which 
increases industry viability and efficiency in production and consumption; and (iv) ensuring that the 
regulatory process is able to balance investor and consumer interests.
Sector Reform
Given the political will, competent people, and appropriate institutions, it will be possible to create and 
enforce the legal and regulatory environment that will attract the private sector investment needed for 
improved energy access to support economic growth. This is a significant departure from the past when 
energy services were provided as a publicly funded benefit for a privileged few. The Government recognizes 
that these reforms represent a major cultural shift which will generate inevitable resistance from powerful 
vested interests benefitting from the status quo. However, the strong stakeholder support for the new policy 
thrust demonstrated by the NESF and NEP validation workshops provides a unique opportunity for 
successful implementation of the reforms. 
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Key performance indicators for the desired cultural shift will be monitored and reported, in order to track 
adherence to the NEP. Indicators will include: (1) on-time payment of electricity bills of Government 
ministries and other parastatals as well as those of individual senior Government officials; (2) the financial 
viability of the Liberia Electricity Corporation or any other public successor company in terms of profitability, 
improvements in billings and collections, cash management, reductions in technical and non-technical losses, 
number of customers connected to the LEC grid, and adherence to LEC’s published disconnection policy; 
(3) operational autonomy of LEC as demonstrated by independent decision making on issues such as 
transparent staff recruitment, selection and remuneration, and transparent procurement of goods and 
services; (4) reduction in loss of petroleum products by LPRC; (5) consistent quality and purity of fuels and 
lubricants sold to the public; (6) accuracy of meters and gauges at both wholesale and retail levels; and 
(7) share of oil revenues received by the national treasury.

interestIn January 2006, ECOWAS approved a White Paper for a regional policy for increasing access to energy 
services for rural and peri-urban populations in line with achieving the Millennium Development Goals in the 
sub-region. In line with these goals, Liberia aims to achieve the following:
40% of Liberian citizens living in rural and peri-urban areas and using traditional biomass for cooking shall 
have access to improved stoves and kerosene or efficient-gas cookers in order to cut indoor pollution;
30% of the urban and peri-urban population shall have access to reliable modern energy services enabling 
them to meet their basic needs (lighting, cooking, communication, and small production-related activities);
15% of the rural population shall have access to reliable modern energy services toward meeting the same 
basic needs; and
25% of the schools, clinics, and community centers in rural areas shall have access to modern energy 
services for lighting, refrigeration, information and communication, etc., and shall be equipped with 
productive energy capacity.
Further, in line with the international community, and based on the principles of extending energy 
access to all Liberians through careful consideration of the environmental costs and benefits, and 
with the goal of maximizing efficiency to minimize costs and any adverse environmental impacts, 
the Government of Liberia states the following additional targets:
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 10% by 2015.
Improving energy efficiency by 20% by 2015.
Raising the share of renewable energy to 30% of electricity production and 10% of overall energy 
consumption by 2015.
Increasing the level of biofuels in transport fuel to 5% by 2015.
Implementing a long-term strategy to make Liberia a carbon neutral country in energy production and 
transportation by 2050.2. THE ENERGY SITUATION
OVERVIEW
Prior to the development of the current NEP, Liberia’s energy policy framework was not documented in a 
formal government publication. However, the existing energy policy can be summarized as follows from the 
various laws establishing the public utilities and energy corporations:
It is the desire of the GOL to expand public utility facilities throughout the country for the benefit of all 
the people (preamble to the law establishing the Public Utilities Authority, 1973);
Public utilities must be efficiently managed and operated in order to derive maximum benefit and ensure 
economic viability; they sustain themselves from revenues from the sale of products and services and 
cannot use their revenues to meet the operational and capital expenditures of other public corporations
(Public Utilities Authority Law, 1973); 
Public utilities and corporations are either de jure or de facto self-regulating monopolies that can conduct 
business across the energy chain from exploration, production, transportation, distribution, wholesale and 
retail sale of all energy products and services and can establish their own prices, quality standards, and 
development plans as well as issue licenses to, and operate in competition with, the private sector (acts 
establishing LEC, NOCAL, and LPRC);
Government-owned energy corporations and agencies have no formal managerial relationship with the 
sector ministry; they are managed by boards and executive officers appointed by the President with the 
advice and consent of the Senate. Boards comprise people appointed from the private sector but include 
cabinet ministers and other senior government officials. Remuneration of Board Chairpersons and 
Executive Officers is subject to approval by the President (Public Utilities Authority Law, 1973);
All infrastructure development is subject to environmental impact assessment and the Government 
encourages the use of renewable energy resources and promotes the conservation of non-renewable energy 
resources (Environmental Protection and Management Law, 2002). 
The granting, implementation, supervision and monitoring of concessions in all sectors of the economy 
including energy is regulated by the Public Procurement and Concessions Act (PPCA) which assigns no 
formal role for the sector ministry (PPCA, 2005).
The current energy situation is a result of the impact of these policies and the effect of the civil crisis from 
which the country is emerging. The policy recommendations that are in this document are designed to bridge 
the gap between the reality on the ground and the vision as expressed in the principles outlined in the 
previous chapter. The National Energy Stakeholders Forum identified the local realities and experiences 
which were then summarized in the National Energy Sector White Paper and confirmed in the validation 
workshops.
In Liberia, as in nearly all the Sub-Saharan African and other less developed countries, woody biomass is the 
primary energy source used for domestic cooking and heating. In 2004, it was estimated that over 95% of the 
population relied on firewood, charcoal, and palm oil for their energy needs. Modern energy services based 
on electricity and petroleum products are predominantly used for economic production and transportation. 
In the household sector, the use of modern energy services consists mainly of kerosene, electricity, and 
liquefied petroleum gas for lighting, cooking, and entertainment. These are used by higher income households 
in urban areas.The current energy situation in Liberia is characterized by a dominance of traditional biomass consumption 
and low access to poor quality and relatively expensive modern energy services. This is a result of the 
country’s underdeveloped economy whose infrastructure was extensively destroyed during the 14 years of 
civil crisis. 
There are three Government energy parastatals established by law – the Liberia Electricity Corporation, 
created in 1973, the Liberia Petroleum Refining Corporation, created in 1978, and the National Oil Company 
of Liberia, created in 2002. All these are corporate entities, wholly owned by the Government and managed 
by boards appointed by the President.
It is significant to note that the war effectively privatized energy service delivery by destroying the capacity of 
the parastatals. The charcoal industry which now dominates the household energy sector is entirely run by 
private operators and community-based organizations. Most electricity is generated by private petrol or diesel 
generators. The private sector is expected to provide the bulk of the planned electricity generation capacity 
development for the medium term. In the petroleum sector, the LPRC is currently only issuing licenses and 
providing storage facilities to private sector importers. The retail sale of petroleum products and lubricants is 
dominated by the private sector.
Notwithstanding this de-facto privatization of the energy sector, the parastatals still have the legal mandates 
allowing them to combine the roles of policy making, monitoring, and operation. This is inconsistent with 
international best practice which separates these roles. In practice, the parastatals discharge their regulatory 
roles in collaboration with the MLME. 
SECTOR SITUATION
Electricity Sector
Under the current legislation, the Liberia Electricity Corporation is responsible for the generation, 
transmission, and distribution of electricity. LEC used to supply the major cities and towns that were 
connected to the grid or had stand-alone diesel plants. 
Additional power was produced by the various mining and 
agricultural concessions. The 14-year conflict resulted in 
collateral damage, looting, and vandalism of virtually all the 
energy infrastructure, such as power plants, substations, 
transmission lines, fuel storage tanks, and depots. Following 
the loss of these facilities, electrical output diminished 
drastically. Consequently, only about 10% of urban residents 
and less than 2% of rural Liberians have electricity access, 
largely produced by small private generator sets at prohibitive 
costs.
Before the civil crisis, the total installed electricity capacity of 
the LEC was approximately 191 megawatts (MW), while that 
of concessionaires was 212 MW. Outside Monrovia there 
were three radial lines extending into the countryside and 11 
small isolated power systems operated by LEC to supply 
electricity to cities and towns located along the coast and in 
rural areas. The installed capacity of the rural electrification 
program totaled 13 MW and distribution lines stretched 90 
miles, with an additional 26 miles of low-voltage service lines. 
The small isolated rural systems were powered by plants 
ranging from 300 kilowatts (kW) to 1300 kW. The total 
installed electricity generation capacity, including the private 
sector, was about 412 MW. To date, Liberia has never had

Following the end of the war and the inauguration of a new democratically-elected Government led by 
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, there have been small but significant steps taken to re-establish public power 
supply and recommercialize LEC. Launched in 2006 soon after the inauguration of the President, the 
Emergency Power Program (EPP) was designed to re-establish public power supply as part of the 
Government’s political stabilization and economic reconstruction program. Several international partners, 
including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Ghana, Norway, the European 
Union, and the World Bank provided over US $40 million in grant funding and technical assistance. LEC 
now has a system with 9.6 MW diesel generation, 80 km of transmission and distribution network, and will 
have about 1,000 street lights and over 2,500 customers in Monrovia within the first half of 2009. Although 
only set at levels to cover operational and maintenance costs, current electricity prices are relatively high at 
over US $0.50/kWh. This is however lower than the cost of self-generation which is estimated at not less 
than US $0.75/kWh. The GOL subsidizes the balance of LEC’s costs and is expected to continue doing so 
during the transition to cheaper medium-term generation options now under active investigation and 
planning. 
There is no generation capacity outside of Monrovia beyond privately-owned generators and scattered donorfunded pilot projects. A number of Government agencies, community organizations and private sector 
establishments in rural locations in several counties have been able to receive diesel generators and solar 
power systems through USAID, the United Nations Development Programme, and some NGOs.
Estimates of the current level of electricity demand range from 11 to 25 MW. While Liberia’s First State of 
the Environment Report forecasts that the demand for electricity will rise an average of 10.3% annually by 
2010, and then decrease slightly to a 3.4% growth annually until 2020, a recent demand forecast by the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) projects total demand for Monrovia and its environs of 19 MW by 
2010, 34 MW by 2015, and 41 MW by 2020. For a variety of reasons, it appears that these forecasts are very 
conservative. The actual demand for Liberia, including the various concessions, is likely to be in excess of 350 
MW by 2020, for the following reasons:
Liberia’s population, estimated at around 3.5 million from the provisional results of the 2008 census, has
been growing at an average annual rate of 2.1%. Over 53 percent of the population is under 18 years of 
age. With a large pent-up demand for consumer goods and services as evidenced by previous levels of 
demand and rising incomes, demand for energy used in the production of these goods will increase as the 
population rises.
Since pre-conflict electricity capacity exceeded 400 MW, it seems likely that at some point the economy will 
begin to take off and very quickly reach previous levels of capacity. Industries which are large consumers 
of energy are only now looking at Liberia for opportunities to re-invest. Cement processing, rubber 
processing, breweries, and other factories and industrial operations have a huge demand for power.
Prior to the civil conflict, the iron ore industry consumed about 210 MW of electricity. Although none of 
these former mines are currently in operation, the Government has prioritized their re-opening in the short 
to medium term, beginning with a recent concession agreement with ArcelorMittal for one of the former 
mines. The next two concessions for the Western Cluster iron ore deposits and the Old Bong Mines will 
be awarded soon. Furthermore, aggressive mineral exploration and resource appraisal programs for 
additional iron ore deposits are underway. The prospects for new hard rock mines for minerals such as 
gold, diamonds, uranium, and bauxite are very promising. The demand for energy for these operations in 
the medium and long term will be very significant, and without a strong Government energy policy, the 
requisite power to fuel these mining operations will not be developed.
The agriculture sector, although mostly artisanal at present, has a high demand for energy services. Agrobased concessions, such as rubber and other mechanized activities, produce electricity for their own 
consumption. Demand for energy in agriculture in the short, medium, and long term will be significant.The LEC is not able to meet its current operating costs for the limited generation provided under the EPP. 
The utility has a US $114 million debt and no capacity to service it. Historically, LEC has always had difficulty 
in revenue collection and coping with electricity theft, and has had 
frequent management changes. LEC has therefore never had, and still 
does not have, the ability to finance the investment needed to satisfy the 
country’s electricity demand. Fortunately, there are several private sector 
developers who are interested in investing in Liberia and who have 
bankable proposals for investment in power generation. Given the 
urgency required for the restoration and extension of the country’s 
electricity generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, and the fact that the Government does not 
have the financial resources to undertake these investments, the only plausible option is to create the 
conditions necessary to support these private sector initiatives. The implementation of the recommendations 
in the NEP, which are designed to fulfill the vision of President Johnson Sirleaf to involve the private sector 
to the greatest degree possible, will play a critical role in ensuring the successful realization of these private 
sector investment initiatives.
Petroleum Sector
Since Liberia has not yet discovered any crude oil and its only refinery is being scrapped, all refined petroleum 
products and lubricants are imported. Yearly volumetric imports of approximately 175,000 metric tons 
consist predominantly of gasoline, diesel fuel, and to a lesser extent, jet fuel and kerosene. Most of the 
petroleum usage in the country is for the transportation sector, which also has critical effects as a cost input 
to other goods and services. With the rising cost of petroleum products there is an increased awareness of the 
need to ensure that petroleum products are of first-rate quality and are used as efficiently as possible.
The GOL’s role in the petroleum sector is conducted through the Division of Hydrocarbons in the MLME 
and two Government-owned parastatals – the “upstream” National Oil Company of Liberia, and the 
“downstream” Liberia Petroleum Refining Corporation. 
Prior to the establishment of NOCAL, MLME’s Division of Hydrocarbons played the lead role in negotiating 
agreements with the handful of international oil companies that came to Liberia with the intent of securing 
upstream petroleum exploration and production contracts. With its creation in 2002 under President Taylor, 
this institutional responsibility was passed on to NOCAL. The MLME is now involved through the InterMinisterial Petroleum Technical Committee (IMPTC), which it chairs. 
In decades of oil exploration activity by international oil companies, no onshore commercial hydrocarbon 
reserves have been discovered, though offshore exploration holds some potential. In the event that oil is 
discovered the country has taken steps to avoid the oil curse where social and political turmoil can result 
when the general public does not benefit from the oil wealth. In September 2007 Liberia achieved Candidate 
Status of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. This means that the country has satisfactorily 
demonstrated its commitment to ensure the transparent and effective disclosure and use of revenues 
generated by its natural resources. 
In the downstream petroleum sector – following institutional evolutions and the closing of the refinery –
LPRC became responsible for negotiating and purchasing requisite volumes of petroleum products and 
lubricants, offloading and storing them, and signing leases with wholesalers for onward sales throughout the 
country. A few private companies had their own storage facilities. Currently, LPRC exercises the authority to 
issue import licenses for petroleum products and lubricants based on the legal interpretation of the 1989 
Petroleum Law that the company has a monopoly on this activity. Furthermore, the Company can either 
franchise out the products or sell these at wholesale and retail levels. A number of large and small vendors 
currently hold licenses and distribute petroleum products and lubricants throughout the country on often 
impassable roads. Owing to the difficulties of distribution, the availability of fuel in more remote rural areas is 
often confined to plastic bottles or gallon jars without any assurance of quality or quantity. Wholesale and 
retail petrol outlets often sell adulterated fuel with little or no oversight by the Bureau of Standards. 
President Johnson Sirleaf 
has committed Liberia to 
involve the private sector to 
the greatest degree 
possible in the power sectorVolumetric gauges at petrol stations are often not calibrated properly, cheating consumers who have few 
avenues of redress.
Despite some progress over the past two years, LPRC needs to make sizeable investments in both the 
offloading infrastructure for petroleum products and in the fuel storage facilities in Monrovia. All these 
facilities suffered from a severe lack of maintenance during the years of civil conflict; in addition, some of the 
facilities have been severely vandalized. In August 2007, LPRC commissioned a report from William G. 
Matthews Associates Limited to assess the infrastructure needs for petroleum product logistics in Monrovia 
and analyze the costs needed for upgrade and repair of the main product storage terminal. 
The firm noted that since the civil conflict ended in 2002, LPRC has performed some “basic maintenance but 
both facilities have technically deteriorated to a degree that they are unsafe and represent a serious risk to the 
country’s fuel supply.” An estimated US $14 million is required to repair the facilities and expand them to 
meet forecast demand in 2013. There is also a need to invest in a jetty-to-shore pipeline and to rehabilitate the 
jetty piers, which fall under the jurisdiction of the Monrovia Port. Further, according to the Consultant’s 
report, the entire pipeline project must be carried out in an integrated manner to reduce costs. 
The existing pipelines are so corroded that operating pressures have had to be reduced to prevent leakage. 
This has resulted in “excessive delivery times” and consequent demurrage charges as the products cannot 
reach shore in contracted volumes on anything resembling an efficient operation or schedule. In addition, the 
“pipe supports are deeply corroded while the walkway grating is largely absent due to pilfering.”
The Consultants found that all 13 tanks thought to be salvageable are in need of serious repair. The cost of 
neglect was reinforced by the Consultants, who noted that nearly 4% of the terminal’s yearly gasoline 
throughput is lost to evaporation. The Matthews Report found the truckloading stations to be derelict in 
terms of international safety standards; soil protection at pumping stations was described as inadequate to
ensure environmental protection. Finally, the Matthews team noted that fire protection is practically nonexistent, owing to the absence of equipment and a near total lack of procedures or training for emergency 
response. It concluded that were a serious fire to occur, the results could be catastrophic – shutting down 
Monrovia’s fuel supply. With Liberia’s petroleum product needs expected to rise dramatically by 2013, the 
GOL recognizes that priority must be given to rectifying these problems. LPRC estimates that it will take 
three to four years to complete the critical repairs, upgrades, and expansion of all aspects of the petroleum 
product and lubricant supply logistics system. 
Rural and Renewable Energy Resources 
Almost 74% of Liberia’s population resides in rural areas, while the remaining 26% live in and around the 
urban center of Monrovia. Rural households expend a significant amount of their meager incomes on inferior 
forms of energy such as candles, flashlights, and kerosene or oil lanterns for lighting. Higher fuel costs result 
from long transportation distances, fragmented delivery systems, and absence of economies of scale. 
The population density of some rural areas along the main highways between the national and county capitals 
makes it economically feasible to connect them to the electricity grid when that is re-established and 
extended. The rest of the rural areas will have to rely on off-grid 
options for a long time – or even indefinitely. Technological 
advances in the exploitation of renewable resources, together with 
cost reductions, have enhanced the possibility of electrifying such 
areas using distributed generation sited close to the electric load.
Liberia also needs to diversify its sources of energy. While dieselbased power generation has been essential in quickly providing 
emergency power to Monrovia, this means of power production 
is inefficient and depletes foreign exchange. Beyond the present 
fossil-fuelled electricity generation, Liberia has enormous 
renewable energy potential. Prior assessments of the renewable 
Liberia must integrate renewable 
energy technologies and services 
into the overall national energy 
supply mix in order to avoid the 
emissions, particulates, and waste 
associated with conventional energy 
sources. This is particularly 
important given limited technical 
and financial resources, a growing 
population, and escalating energy 
demand and consumption.energy resource potential in Liberia have demonstrated abundant hydro, biomass, and solar resources for 
development. Liberia has six major rivers, which drain over 60% of the country’s water. These include the 
Mano, Saint Paul, Lofa, Saint John, Cestos, and Cavalla Rivers. Short coastal waterways drain about 3% of the 
country’s water. This intensive drainage pattern indicates considerable potential for hydroelectric power in 
Liberia. At the onset of the civil war, there were three operational hydroelectric power plants in Liberia: 
Harbel, which was operated by Firestone Natural Rubber Co., with a capacity of 4.0 MW; Mount Coffee, 
operated by LEC, with a capacity of 64 MW; and Yandahun, a community-managed micro-hydro system in 
Lofa County, with a capacity of 30 kW. The Mount Coffee and Yandahun plants were destroyed during the 
war, but the Harbel plant is still operational for use by Firestone. Recent surveys of the damage at Mount 
Coffee indicate that rehabilitation and restoration of the plant to operational status may be possible within 7-
10 years, providing vitally needed generating capacity.
The country is endowed with considerable biomass resources that, if managed sustainably, could contribute 
to the energy supply mix. These include rubber, oil palm, pine, and other trees as well as cassava, sugarcane, 
elephant grass, coconuts, and crop residues from rice and 
wheat production. Sustainable management of such resources 
must include replanting programs, to ensure that utilization 
of biomass for energy does not contribute to deforestation, 
and close coordination with the agriculture sector, to ensure 
that biomass for energy does not compete with biomass for 
food production. In addition, annual solar insolation shows 
good prospects for the application of solar technologies such 
as photovoltaic and solar thermal systems. Though no official 
renewable resource assessment has been carried out in 
Liberia, preliminary estimates suggest that the monthly 
average daily solar radiation on horizontal surfaces in Liberia is between 4.0 and 6.0 kWh/m2/day. Finally, 
observations along the coastal regions suggest that there are potential prospects for the development of wind 
power.
Notwithstanding these abundant resources and off-grid generation technologies, limited financial, 
institutional, and human capacity constrains Liberia’s ability to harness its renewable energy resources to serve 
the population. Setting a realistic goal for replacing a percentage of the country’s existing fossil energy 
demand with non-fossil fuels within a specified time period will help galvanize investment in the renewable 
energy sector.
Many of the rural population cannot afford to pay for modern energy services without end-use subsidies;
capital subsidies for project development; or outside assistance from NGOs, bilateral and multilateral donor 
agencies. Consequently, many homes in Liberia, which will not be able to afford the full delivered cost of 
electricity in the short to medium term, will require support for more efficient technologies for sustainable 
production and utilization of traditional energy resources. 
CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
Energy Policy and Planning 
The National Energy Committee was established in 1984 to facilitate stakeholder coordination for policy 
development and strategic planning for the energy sector. The NEC became dormant in the few years leading 
to the civil crisis and has not been convened since then. Consequently, until this policy formulation process 
was launched in October 2006 with the National Energy Stakeholders Forum, this vital government function 
had been neglected. 
The GOL is using the EPP Steering Committee to coordinate the efforts of various donors and to facilitate 
planning for the medium term. This is a temporary arrangement and it is necessary to establish a more 
formalized policy and planning process. 
Liberia’s Significant 
Renewable & Hydropower Potential
 Monthly average daily solar radiation of 4.0-
6.0 kWh/m2/day
 Potential wind power in coastal areas
 Biomass (rubber, oil palm, pine, cassava, 
sugarcane, elephant grass, coconut, crop 
residues)
 Intensive drainage patterns indicate 
substantial hydropower potential – 6 major 
rivers drain 66% of country’s waterPolicy Monitoring and Regulation
The Government’s oversight of the energy sector is exercised through the Ministry of Lands, Mines and 
Energy. Under current legislation, there is no independent energy regulatory board. This is a situation where 
the GOL and its agencies play the role of referee and player at the same time. This creates an uneven playing 
field that can be a significant barrier to the further growth of the private sector.
The Department of Energy in the MLME comprises one Assistant Minister supported by two senior officers, 
one responsible for hydrocarbons and one responsible for alternative energy. The Government therefore has 
limited capacity to undertake energy policy monitoring and regulatory functions. The Ministry chairs 
NOCAL’s Inter-Ministerial Petroleum Technical Committee. The MLME has no office that is solely 
dedicated to the electricity sector. During the Emergency Power Programs I and II, LEC has reported 
regularly to the Emergency Power Program (EPP) Steering Committee through which the GOL has had 
access to donor-funded technical assistance. The MLME chairs the Steering Committee, but the Ministry’s 
oversight of LEC is otherwise ad hoc. 
Energy Efficiency, Conservation, and Environment
From an environmental perspective, energy production and use can harm human health and the environment 
if not efficiently and sustainably undertaken. The inefficient use of traditional woody biomass by over 95% of 
the population poses environmental threats and health problems through deforestation and indoor air 
pollution. At the same time, the unsustainable use of forest resources at an alarming rate for the production 
of energy poses a growing and serious threat to the environment and the country’s ecosystem, including the 
future viability of the country’s hydro resources. Demand for charcoal and firewood will continue to grow in 
the absence of electricity and energy efficiency measures.
Nations of the world have been called into action through the UN Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) to mitigate, abate or reverse emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse 
gases into the earth’s atmosphere. Fossil fuel energy consumption and deforestation constitute two of the 
major sources of greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol and its post-2012 successor arrangements recently 
launched in Bali prescribe mechanisms for reducing greenhouses gas emissions and encourage the harnessing 
of non-fossil fuel energy sources. Liberia subscribes to the World Summit on Sustainable Development and 
its Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. Liberia is also a party to several multilateral environmental 
agreements, recognizing that obligations under these instruments are necessary to address environmental 
conservation and sustainable use of resources. Liberia’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been 
given the mandate to supervise, coordinate, and consult on all environmental activities in the country.
As a member of the shrinking global village, the long-term energy policy of Liberia must take into account the 
reality of global warming with the concomitant acceptance by our nation of its part in the collective 
responsibility to reduce emissions and protect the environment. Indeed, the nation has a large reserve of 
tropical forests which serve as a carbon sink for greenhouse gases. Following enactment of a global carbon 
regime, Liberia may receive financial payments for protecting these resources while contributing to the 
benefit of all humankind. In fact, the nation’s valuable renewable hydro, biomass, wind, and solar resources 
may allow Liberia to lead the way in becoming one of the least carbon dependent nations in the world. 
Energy efficiency and resource conservation can also represent the most cost-effective and immediate 
solutions to minimize the supply-side investments necessary to meet growth in energy demand. Energy 
efficiency measures involve replacing existing technologies and processes with new ones that provide 
equivalent or better energy service using less energy. The value of the saved energy typically at least covers the 
cost of deploying the new technologies and processes. Energy efficiency programs can reduce future 
investment requirements, enhance competitiveness by lowering input and operating costs, free up capital for 
other social and economic development priorities, and contribute to environmental stewardship objectives.Gender-Related Energy Issues 
As is typical in developing countries Liberia’s limited access to modern fuels and electricity contributes to 
gender inequality. Women and children are responsible for most household cooking, gathering firewood or 
making charcoal, and fetching water. This takes time away from other productive activities as well as from 
educational and social participation. 
Access to modern fuels eases the domestic burden on women and children, reducing the strain on their 
health and allowing them to pursue educational, economic, and other opportunities. Modern energy services 
allow health clinics to refrigerate vaccines, treat patients at night, and educate via television and radio. 
Improvements in health raise human productivity, which in turn raises incomes. Access to electricity also 
leads to significant reductions in maternal mortality. Women who have no opportunity for school during the 
daytime can take advantage of night literacy classes, which require electricity to function. 
Economic productivity can increase significantly once women and children are free from the daily burdens of 
fetching firewood, making charcoal, and walking long distances to fetch water. They can become gainfully 
employed in industries such as tailoring, which makes use of electric sewing machines, and other cottage 
industries such as small bakeries, canteens, and laundry services, which require very little electricity yet can 
transform lives. Women can also become active in the development of rural energy services around the 
country, as well as carrying out marketing campaigns and teaching others about new lighting, cooking, and 
other technologies.
It is vital to identify and mitigate the negative impacts arising from the differentiated social and economic 
roles of men and women in the context of energy policy. Millennium Development Goal 3 addresses 
“promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment.” The Government will need to ensure that 
provision of energy services is targeted at narrowing the opportunity gap between men and women. Although 
the GOL has a ministry dedicated to gender affairs, it has no program or capacity to address energy-related 
gender issues. The MLME, which should take a lead role in developing and implementing appropriate policies 
to address these important considerations, does not currently have the necessary resources to do so.
Regional Cooperation
Liberia is a member of the Economic Community of West African States which is working towards greater 
regional cooperation in energy. ECOWAS has approved an Energy Protocol that outlines principles for 
cross-border energy trade and investment. The West African Power Pool and the West African Gas Pipeline 
present opportunities for the long-term development of Liberia’s large hydropower potential. The GOL is 
committed to membership in these organizations and participation in these projects. 
The ECOWAS Energy Protocol was approved by the Heads of State of the Member States of ECOWAS in 
January 2004. Since then, it has undergone various ratification processes in those Member States. Although 
this is a key document for defining the investment climate in Liberia’s energy sector the country has not yet 
acceded to the Protocol. This important Protocol provides a ready-made framework for long-term energy 
sector cooperation among Member States, unimpeded energy transit, and increased cross-border energy trade. 
Since Liberia’s energy potential, particularly hydropower, once it is fully developed, is likely to remain surplus 
relative to the country’s domestic energy needs for many years to come, participation in these cross-border 
projects will generate valuable foreign exchange on a sustained basis.
The West African Power Pool was created by Decision of the ECOWAS Heads of State in December 1999 
to address the issue of power supply deficiency within West Africa. Following that Directive, WAPP was 
guided by a Steering Committee comprised of Energy Ministers of the ECOWAS Member States, and 
supported by a Project Implementation Committee, comprising Managing Directors of Members States’
utilities, and Technical and Institutional Working Groups. In January 2006, the new WAPP Organization was 
established, with Member States, including Liberia, executing an Articles of Agreement the following July. 
Presently, Liberia’s designation as a Zone B Area gives it a lower priority for interties. It is the desire of the 
Government of Liberia to elevate that priority such that intertie opportunities become available soon. To that end, it is the policy of the GOL to promote active participation in WAPP, including seeking interties with the 
power systems of neighboring countries. Through the MLME and LEC, Liberia is already an active 
participant in WAPP activities. The country is participating in cross-border rural electrification projects that 
will benefit 18 communities in the counties along the border with Cote d’Ivoire. A major transmission 
interconnector is planned that will assist Liberia in re-establishing a national grid that will be linked to Cote 
d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Sierra Leone.
In the gas sector, construction is nearly complete of the West African Gas Pipeline, bringing Nigerian gas to 
Benin, Togo, and Ghana. The Nigerian gas is being flared or vented currently and represents a relatively low 
cost and plentiful source of energy which will be used by the recipient countries for power generation.3. ELECTRICITY SECTOR REFORM
SECTOR REFORM PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES
Although the Government’s desire for universal energy access was expressed decades ago, the reality is that 
even before the civil crisis access was limited to a privileged few in the main cities and towns. The significant 
private sector investment in power generation was for individual consumption. LEC had the legal mandate to 
“engage in the development, generation and transmission of electrical energy, the manufacture, construction 
and installation of electrical equipment and devices related thereto, and the distribution and sale of said 
electrical energy and related electrical equipment and devices, to cities, towns and the public in general for 
heating, lighting, and power purposes.” 
Ownership of LEC was restricted to the Government, which did not have the ability to provide enough 
capital to enable the utility to discharge its mandate fully and to extend services to the majority of the 
population as dictated by the policy. Notwithstanding its legal authority to determine its own rates, fees, and 
charges, LEC never had the revenue to generate the capital from its own resources. Only 6% of its pre-war 
generating capacity was dedicated to rural electrification, which in practice was limited to county capitals.
In order to prevent abuse of its considerable self-regulating powers, the law places restrictions on the 
operational autonomy of LEC. The restricted operational autonomy has had counter-productive results 
because over the years this has compromised LEC’s ability to achieve the expected economic viability and 
management efficiency.
The current shortcomings in the performance of the electricity sector are a result of the following existing 
policy inconsistencies:
1. The electricity business is highly capital intensive and yet the law restricts the LEC to 100% 
ownership by the Government, which has never been able to provide sufficient capital to enable the 
utility to discharge its mandate;
2. Notwithstanding the Government’s explicitly stated desire to provide access to the whole country, 
the law is silent on the special needs for rural energy investments and hence, minimal attention has 
been devoted to rural areas in practice. Rural areas are remote and sparsely populated and have 
relatively lower income levels compared to urban areas and this makes it financially unviable for 
investors to provide modern energy services in these areas. 
3. Although in theory LEC has autonomy to set its own rates, fees, and charges, in practice this is 
negated by its restricted operational autonomy which in turn restricts the ability of the organization 
to achieve the management efficiency required for the desired economic viability.
The vision of the universal access to reliable and secure electricity services will be achieved by adopting the 
following improved policy framework that builds upon the positive aspects of the existing policies and 
removes the identified weaknesses:
STATEMENTS OF POLICY
1. It is the policy of the Government to accelerate the pace of electrification by facilitating 
increased private sector investment in the electricity supply industry through the unbundling 
of the manufacture, generation, transmission, distribution, and retail sale of electricity and 
encouraging the sale of excess generating capacity from private facilities to neighboring 
communities.2. It is the policy of the Government to encourage and support the development and sale of 
excess electricity generating capacity by private investors, for the benefit of neighboring 
communities, as part of their corporate social responsibility.
3. It is the policy of the Government to promote regional cooperation in electricity through a 
wholly or partly publicly owned and efficiently managed national grid company that shall 
actively participate in the West African Power Pool and other regional and international 
activities designed to enhance international trade in electricity.
4. It is the policy of the Government to establish a transparent and independent electricity 
regulatory process that will ensure the safe, secure, reliable, and environmentally-friendly 
production and use of electricity at cost-reflective but affordable prices.
5. It is the policy of the Government to promote the least-cost development and utilization of 
the electricity facilities, taking account of the economic, financial, social, and environmental 
factors and the special need to ensure access by the poor through use of targeted and 
transparent capital subsidies.
GRID POWER
Access
The unbundling of the electricity industry will result in transparent costing and pricing of generation, 
transmission, distribution, and retail sale of electricity, allowing the entry of private sector and community 
developers into segments of the industry where they are competitive in terms of expertise and resources.
The Government, with technical assistance from LEC, shall develop a grid development master plan to 
facilitate the orderly development of the power system by the public, private sector, and local communities.
The grid master plan shall complement the rural energy master plan based on off-grid and renewable energy 
technology investments. The Government shall make maximum use of opportunities for cross-border 
connections at the distribution level to accelerate the electrification of communities along the country’s 
borders.
The Government shall allow access to the grid by licensed generators and distributors on terms and 
conditions designed to incentivize private investment capital.
Quality
The national grid shall be designed and operated to allow safe, secure, and reliable operation when 
interconnected with neighboring countries.
Cost
The Government shall ensure the long-term financial viability of efficiently managed electric utilities by 
allowing full-cost recovery from those who are able to pay and providing explicit subsidies targeted at those 
with limited ability to pay. The Government shall undertake long run marginal cost (LRMC) studies as a tool 
for the least-cost development of the power system. The LRMC is theoretically the cost of providing for an 
indefinite increase in demand but in practice is estimated using the incremental cost of expanding capacity to 
meet demand over a defined long-term planning horizon. Operators shall be free to set their own prices, 
subject to costs allowed by the regulatory board. Where feasible the regulator shall encourage free and fair 
competition to enable consumers to get the best prices.
Institutions
The Government policy-setting functions for grid-based electricity shall be exercised through a Grid Power
Unit within the MLME’s Department of Energy. The Government shall issue investment and operating 
licenses for independent power producers, independent power transmission and distributors whose operations shall be monitored by the Energy Regulatory Board. The ERB shall be resourced adequately to 
perform its mandate of monitoring of costs, review of plans, and quality standards and promotion of fair
competition, including dispute resolution among stakeholders.
To facilitate the involvement of the private sector in generation, distribution and retail functions – the 
competitive aspects of LEC’s business – the Government shall consider and implement several privatization 
options, which shall include but not be restricted to, management contracting, BOT (Build, Operate, and 
Transfer), BOO (Build, Own, and Operate), and BOOT (Build, Own, Operate, and Transfer). 
Because of the monopoly nature of the national grid and the inter-governmental relationships involved in 
regional cooperation activities it shall be necessary, for the foreseeable future, for the Government to 
maintain significant ownership of a restructured, operationally efficient, and financially viable LEC as the 
national grid company. In this capacity the LEC will be the country’s utility representative in WAPP and 
other regional and international forums for cooperation in electricity. With this strategy the country will 
position itself to develop its large hydropower potential. 
To facilitate the development of large-scale hydropower for local 
and export demand, the Government shall, at an appropriate 
time, establish a Saint Paul River Authority or Liberia River 
Authority (LRA) which will be a public/private partnership 
modeled loosely on the federally directed Tennessee Valley 
Authority (see box) in the United States or Ghana’s Volta River 
Authority. The SPRA or LRA will focus on river basin 
management and facilitating hydropower development and will 
not diversify into thermal power generation as TVA did. The 
Authority will effect a wholesale economic transformation of the 
country by developing large-scale hydropower potential of the 
nation’s river basins, estimated at over 1000 MW by several
studies conducted before the civil crisis. This should fuel Liberia’s 
economy, as well as provide power for export and thereby 
generate valuable foreign exchange, and develop ancillary 
irrigation systems that will generate employment in agriculture 
and other high value agro-processing industries. In addition, the 
development of reservoirs will allow for development of a tourist 
industry and job creation for fishing, boating, wildlife 
management, and related economic activities. The Authority will 
have oversight authority, excluding licensing, for all development activities affecting both upstream and 
downstream portions of the Saint Paul and other river basins, including the revitalization of the Mount 
Coffee hydropower plant in a manner consistent with optimal development of Liberia’s water and 
hydroelectric resources.
OFF-GRID POWER AND RENEWABLE ENERGY
Access
To avoid the historical neglect of remote and low income rural communities the Government shall establish 
special incentives and financing mechanisms to facilitate the availability of affordable electricity supplies. The 
development and growth of private and community-owned rural energy service companies shall be 
supported. 
The Government recognizes the need to provide efficient non-electric energy resources for those 
communities that will, for the foreseeable future, not have access to the grid or off-grid electricity due to 
affordability and resource constraints. Examples of non-electric energy resources that could be considered 
include high-efficiency charcoal or biomass stoves for cooking. Low cost but efficient solar lanterns will be 
TENNESSEE VALLEY 
AUTHORITY
The TVA was a vast US
Government project commenced in 
the 1930s, designed to harness the 
hydroelectric power of the 
southeastern region of the United 
States to make power affordable for 
everyone and to stem floods, while 
providing electricity that would 
attract industry into a historically 
economically deprived area, and 
providing well-paying jobs. 
Legislation establishing the TVA 
was amended in 1959 to allow it to 
be self-financed and supported, and 
thus competitive with private power 
producers in the region.promoted for lighting. To generate employment and help to raise incomes for such communities, the 
Government will prioritize the use of modern energy services for productive activities. With increased 
incomes, demand for modern energy services for enhanced quality of life will increase naturally.
Quality
To protect customers the Government shall establish and enforce technical standards for renewable energy 
technologies used for off-grid electrification. The Government shall also establish a licensing system for 
installation contractors.
Cost
The Government shall adhere to the policy of cost-reflective but affordable pricing. Operators shall be free to 
establish their own prices subject to costs allowed by the ERB and pricing principles designed to facilitate 
access by the poor. Appropriate financing mechanisms will need to be established to support all economically 
and socially acceptable rural energy projects regardless of financial viability. Targeted subsidies in the form of 
grants, low interest loans or guarantees shall be utilized to allow access by the poor.
Institutions
The Government shall establish an Off-Grid Power and Renewable Energy Unit in the MLME (within the 
Division of Electricity and Renewable Energy) and a Rural and Renewable Energy Agency and its associated 
Rural Energy Fund as institutions dedicated to provide the special support required for remote and low 
income communities. The RREA, which shall be responsible for managing the REFUND, shall provide 
technical and financial support, but the actual delivery of services will be undertaken by the public and private 
sectors, and community developers, with the regulatory oversight of the ERB. Section 5 provides more details 
on the institutional framework for rural and renewable energy.4. PETROLEUM SECTOR REFORM
SECTOR REFORM PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES
The Government’s institutional framework for the petroleum sector comprises an office responsible for 
hydrocarbons in the MLME and two state-owned enterprises dedicated to upstream operations (NOCAL) 
and downstream operations (LPRC). In many countries which have human and material resource constraints 
similar to those facing Liberia the upstream and downstream operations are undertaken within one company. 
This has the advantage of reducing institutional costs and overheads. 
In the upstream sub-sector petroleum exploration and development is one of the highest priorities for the 
nation. Although the history in Liberia shows that there was minimal attention given to upstream operations 
until a dedicated institution for that sub-sector was created, one of the major lessons that have been learned
from experience is that the Government needs to be more involved in the upstream sector to ensure that the 
public interest is protected. On the other hand, in the downstream operations the focus is to unbundle in 
order to facilitate the maximum private sector investment that is urgently required. The remaining functions 
can then be more efficiently undertaken by a single corporation that has responsibility over both upstream 
and downstream operations. Subject to the necessary legislative process, the GOL will create such a 
corporation to be the successor to NOCAL and LPRC.
Because the law does not provide for separation of policy-setting, monitoring, and operational roles, both the 
MLME and NOCAL are involved in policy setting in the upstream sector. The MLME chairs the InterMinisterial Petroleum Technical Committee (IMPTC) that analyzes the technical issues related to applications 
for licenses and concessions. The IMPTC is the technical arm of the Inter-Ministerial Concessions 
Committee (IMCC) which makes the final recommendations, in accordance with applicable laws, regulations,
and procedures, to grant the licenses and concessions. NOCAL receives applications from interested 
investors, submits them to the IMPTC, to which it provides technical advice, and then supervises the 
implementation of the resultant concession agreements. Except for NOCAL’s conflict of interest explained in 
more detail below, and the need to have a more formally defined role for the sector ministry, this licensing 
process, which is in accordance with the Public Procurement and Concessions Act (PPCA), works very well 
and the Government shall also adopt it for the licensing of the electricity sector and downstream operations.
With the creation of an independent regulatory body, the Energy Regulatory Board, it will be necessary to 
amend the Petroleum Law to vest explicitly the policy setting functions in the MLME, policy monitoring role 
in the ERB, and the commercial operational functions in NOCAL or its successor. The main problems with 
the Act which established NOCAL and the New Petroleum Law under which it is operating are 
inconsistencies and, in some instances, violation of international best practices:
1. Those Acts empower NOCAL to grant petroleum rights to itself as well as to other companies. In 
essence, companies may compete with NOCAL in the allocation of petroleum blocks. This makes 
NOCAL a “player and referee at the same time.”
2. Blanket powers were given to NOCAL to “...undertake planning for the orderly, rational and 
optimized development of the petroleum and energy requirements of the Republic of Liberia.” This 
conflicts with one of the functions of the Minister of Lands, Mines and Energy.
3. The Act empowers NOCAL to participate in downstream petroleum activities. With the existence of 
the LPRC, two public corporations are in charge of the same sub-sector. 
4. There are also concerns about budget, especially if oil is found. As a public corporation, NOCAL will 
legally have the right to expend millions or billions of oil revenue, as long as it has the approval of 
the Board of Directors. 5. The Petroleum Law is also inconsistent in its discussion of the signatories required to make 
petroleum contracts binding on the state. The Law mentions nothing of Legislative Ratification of 
Petroleum Agreements. 
There are other issues in the Petroleum Law which have to be addressed to make Liberia competitive for 
private sector investment in the upstream sector, such as the Government’s free equity, mandatory bidding 
requirements for blocks, and other petroleum contracts. 
To underscore the country’s desire to achieve international best practice in terms of transparency and good 
governance, Liberia has joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which is a verifiable 
commitment to ensure the transparent and effective disclosure and use of revenues generated by its natural 
resources.
In the downstream sub-sector there have been significant improvements since 2006. The main problems 
concern the quality of the petroleum products and lubricants, dilapidated storage and pipeline facilities, and 
legal provisions that create conflicts of interest by giving LPRC functions that overlap policy setting, 
monitoring, and implementation. Therefore, the main issues for the downstream sector are the unbundling of 
LPRC operations to facilitate privatization and the review of the enabling legislation to remove current 
inconsistencies. The following specific actions are to be undertaken:
1. Amendment of LPRC’s corporate charter to limit its monopoly role in overseeing: (i) the physical 
importation of petroleum products and lubricants; (ii) the requisite offloading and handling facilities 
at the port (including all pipelines); (iii) the ownership of storage tanks and other ancillary facilities; 
(iv) the further offloading onto trucks for wholesale distribution; and (v) responsibility for meeting all 
safety and environmental laws, rules, regulations on any of the above activities.
2. Transfer of the legal authority to manage and operate the jetty-to-shore pipeline and the 
rehabilitation and operation of the jetty piers from the Monrovia Port Authority to the LPRC or 
another licensee after international competitive bidding.
3. Transfer to ERB of all regulatory oversight of petroleum product and lubricant quality, regulation of 
all tank cars moving such products to enforce compliance with safety and environmental laws, rules,
and regulations, as well as monitoring of retail outlets to ensure quality standards, proper calibration 
of pumps, etc.
4. Rescission of LPRC’s right to issue import licenses and transfer of this authority to the InterMinisterial Committee chaired by the MLME, which will be responsible for establishing transparent 
licensing criteria, with LPRC serving as technical advisor as required.
5. Scrapping of LPRC’s old refinery, which has been out of commission even before the 
commencement of the civil conflict and was severely looted during the years of unrest, and allowing 
private investors to explore investment opportunities for construction of a new refinery focused on 
the export market because the domestic demand at present is relatively small.
STATEMENTS OF POLICY
1. Given the Government’s limited human, financial, and material resources and infrastructure,
upstream and downstream petroleum operations (exploration, production, refining, 
wholesale and retail operations) shall be undertaken by a single state-owned corporation 
operating in partnership with domestic and international private enterprise. 
2. It is the policy of the Government to ensure transparent and independent regulatory 
oversight by vesting policy setting functions in the MLME, policy monitoring functions in 
the Energy Regulatory Board, and limiting the role of public and private companies to policy 
implementation.3. It is the policy of the Government of Liberia that environmental protection is exercised to the 
maximum extent possible throughout all aspects of petroleum exploration and development. 
Petroleum exploration and development should be conducted within sound principles of 
resource conservation together with due regard for the health and safety of workers, marine 
and other waterborne wildlife, and surrounding communities. Where laws need modification 
to ensure such environmental protection, it is the policy of the Government that this be made 
a critical priority of both the legislative and executive agencies.
4. It is the policy of the Government that throughout the entire process of petroleum 
exploration and extraction there should be transparency of procedure and accountability to 
the Liberian people. 
UPSTREAM OPERATIONS
Access
For the purpose of oil exploration, the country has been divided into 17 blocks which extend from the 
continental shelf into deep water. These are allocated to petroleum exploration companies on the basis of 
international competitive bidding. As incentives, the winning bidders are offered internationally competitive 
terms in Production-Sharing Agreements (PSAs) where they get the bulk of the revenues in the initial years in 
order to recoup their development costs.
Quality
Tendering for exploration blocks shall be based on transparent international competitive bidding.
Cost
All operations shall be monitored by the ERB to minimize adverse impacts on health, safety and 
environment.
Institutions
Under the proposed reforms, the MLME, acting through the Hydrocarbons Division (Upstream Operations
Unit), shall be the Procuring or Concession Entity for the purposes of the PPCA. The MLME shall assume 
responsibility for policy formulation, setting the terms and conditions of companies desiring licenses for 
exploratory drilling, exploration, and commercial development. Based on these criteria, internationally 
competitive tenders for access to various areas of the country, including both onshore and offshore activities, 
shall be issued and bids processed in accordance with the regulations. Any fees, royalty payments or drilling 
bonuses from the resultant agreements that include concessions, leases, and production-sharing agreements 
relating to petroleum exploration and development, are public funds that shall be collected according to 
prevailing revenue legislation. A percentage of the funds collected, to be specified in regulations, shall be 
allocated as a contribution towards rural energy development.
The assumption of the above functions by the MLME will require the amendment of the existing legislation 
establishing NOCAL and LPRC which are currently vested with these policy setting functions. The GOL 
shall create a new state-owned enterprise, the Liberia National Oil Corporation that shall take over the 
technical and commercial operational functions of NOCAL and LPRC that do not relate to the GOL’s policy 
setting and monitoring roles. NOCAL’s residual functions shall be undertaken by LNOC’s department of 
upstream operations, and those of LPRC shall be undertaken by LNOC’s department of downstream 
operations. LNOC shall provide technical advice to the Government in determining licensing criteria and 
during the processing of applications for licenses and concessions. LNOC shall continue NOCAL’s present 
function of reviewing technical proposals from the international oil and gas industry and providing them with 
the best geophysical and other data available to the Government. If commercial discoveries are made, LNOC
staff, working as production-sharing contractors, will represent the Government’s financial interest. Revenue accruing from Liberia’s share of PSAs or other payments will be sent to the Ministry of Finance (MoF). 
LNOC shall also be called upon to advise MoF, MLME, and ERB on the implementation by licensees of the 
terms and conditions of their concessions, PSAs, or other contract terms. If deficiencies are found, these shall 
be referred to the ERB for resolution. 
LNOC’s operating budget shall be funded from revenues derived from the licenses and other fees with any 
deficit being made up from funds allocated from the national budget. LNOC’s board, which will no longer 
comprise Cabinet Ministers but technically and managerially qualified people from the private sector, shall be 
responsible for preparing the budget and submitting through the MLME for GOL approval in accordance 
with standing regulations. The board shall provide operating reports and audited accounts to the GOL 
through the Ministry’sDivision of Hydrocarbons.
DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS
Access
In order to expand access to both urban and rural areas, various options are to be considered, such as partial 
or full privatization of the LPRC, or unbundling the operations of the LPRC into various functional 
companies and privatizing some of these businesses. The RREA shall actively promote and support 
commercial delivery of quality petroleum products and lubricants through rural energy service companies. 
Quality
Based on standards established by the Government, the ERB shall establish a monitoring system to ensure 
accuracy of gauges, quality of products, and compliance with safety and environmental regulations.
Cost
The Government shall ensure that the pricing of petroleum products is determined using a transparent 
formula and the costs to be recovered shall be subject to regulatory oversight by the ERB. 
Institutions
The Government shall exercise policy setting functions for this sub-sector through the Downstream 
Operations Unit in the Division of Hydrocarbons of the MLME. LPRC’s functions that are not privatized or 
transferred to the MLME shall be undertaken by LNOC. The LNOC’s downstream operations department 
shall be the technical advisor to the Government, performing the same role in the licensing and regulatory 
process as that described for the upstream sub-sector. Similarly, any public funds from downstream 
operations shall be collected in accordance with prevailing revenue legislation.5. RURAL AND RENEWABLE 
ENERGY DEVELOPMENT 
SECTOR REFORM PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES
The major constraints to the delivery of rural energy services are affordability and remoteness. Rural areas 
are characterized by relatively low income levels due to underdeveloped economic potential. Many rural 
communities are difficult to access owing to poor transport and communication infrastructure. Consequently,
commercial energy service providers, who operate on the basis of financial viability, tend to avoid serving 
remote and low income rural areas. 
Without dedicated institutions that are resourced to deal with the special challenges of energy provision for 
the rural poor, the rural communities will continue to be neglected. Accordingly, the Government will 
establish, by law, a Rural and Renewable Energy Agency and Rural Energy Fund to support all economically 
viable, socially acceptable, and environmentally friendly rural energy projects and programs regardless of 
financial viability. The focus on renewable energy is due to the fact that off-grid and renewable energy 
technologies offer the best solution for remote communities and will complement the targeted subsidies that 
will address the issue of affordability.
While electricity will be the major focus of the rural energy activities of the RREA, care will be taken to 
ensure that balanced attention is given to non-electrical options – hence the creation of an “Energy” rather 
than an “Electrification” agency. This is in recognition of the reality that many rural people are too remote 
and too poor for regular electricity supply to be a feasible energy option for them in the short to medium 
term. These people can still attain a higher quality of life through affordable solar lanterns and LED lighting 
and more efficient and less labor-intensive non-electrical energy technologies, such as efficient charcoal and 
wood stoves. 
One of the most important tools for the RREA and REFUND will be a Rural Energy Master Plan, which will 
provide a prioritized development program to achieve universal energy access. Together with a Grid 
Development Master Plan, the country’s long-run marginal cost can then be derived to serve as a strategic 
planning guide. 
The day-to-day operations of the RREA shall be managed by a board appointed by the Minister with the 
consent and advice of the President. The MLME shall provide policy guidance through the Office of Off-grid 
Power and Renewable Energy. The ERB shall provide regulatory oversight which will take account of the 
need for simplified licensing and monitoring procedures for small installations (less than 500 kW or some
threshold determined from operational experience).
The ultimate goal of the RREA and the REFUND is to ensure that every household, commercial 
enterprise, and social and administrative center in every village and town of every district of every 
county has access to affordable, sustainable and environmentally friendly modern energy services. 
STATEMENTS OF POLICY
1. It is the policy of the Government to facilitate and accelerate the economic transformation of 
rural Liberia by establishing a semi-autonomous agency dedicated to the commercial 
development and supply of modern energy services to rural areas with an emphasis on 
locally available renewable resources.2. It is the policy of the Government to support the development of all economically viable,
socially acceptable, and environmentally friendly rural energy projects regardless of financial 
viability. Social acceptability shall include the need to provide preference to projects by 
Liberian nationals and those that take account of diversity and national interest.
3. It is the policy of the Government to ensure that the utilization of biomass and other 
renewable resources for energy does not contribute to deforestation or to food insecurity and 
will adopt appropriate environmental and agricultural support strategies such as treereplanting programs and limiting biofuel production to non-edible plants or food crops that 
are surplus to requirements. 
4. It shall be the policy of the Government to prioritize projects on the basis of economic, 
demographic, and geographical criteria designed to ensure enhanced access with equity. 
RURAL AND RENEWABLE ENERGY AGENCY
Purpose 
The Rural and Renewable Energy Agency shall facilitate and accelerate the economic transformation of rural 
Liberia by promoting the commercial development and supply of modern energy services to rural areas with 
an emphasis on locally available renewable resources. The agency shall have an operational role under the 
oversight of the ERB and the policy direction of the MLME. The RREA’s principal functions will be the 
planning and financing of projects to be implemented by public, private, and community developers. 
Secondary functions will include educating the general public about renewable energy as well as rural energy 
options and opportunities. In regard to the latter, the RREA will facilitate capacity building among potential 
rural energy service companies, including training in financial controls and general business management.
Planning
The RREA shall prepare rural energy master plans which will integrate energy into rural development 
planning and other cross-cutting issues such as gender considerations, biomass use for food versus fuel, 
energy efficiency, and environmental protection, including deforestation safeguards; promote research and 
development of renewable energy technologies; recommend policies and standards for renewable energy 
equipment and service provision; and establish a central repository or one-stop center for all information on 
rural energy activities in the country.
Financing
The RREA shall facilitate the funding of rural energy projects, including managing a Rural Energy Fund that 
will provide low interest loans, loan guarantees, and grants as targeted subsidies to ensure access by the poor.
The operations of the RREA shall be supported by the REFUND.
Projects
The RREA shall provide technical assistance to support the development, operation, and maintenance of 
rural energy products and services delivered through rural energy service companies and community 
initiatives.
RURAL ENERGY FUND
Purpose 
The REFUND is to be established by law to provide for the coordinated and sustainable financing of 
projects and programs for the delivery of modern energy services for rural development. Once the REFUND 
has been established it shall become the channel through which all domestic and international financial 
resources intended for rural energy delivery in Liberia shall be managed. REFUND’s main distinction from other funds is the focus on economic viability, including environmental and social benefits, regardless of 
financial viability. Prioritization of projects on the basis of economic viability will ensure that the incomegeneration programs supported by initial investments will be able to contribute financially to subsequent 
projects. It is also important, however, to consider demographic and geographic criteria in order to ensure 
growth with equity. Where projects are of the same order of economic viability, preference shall be given to 
those serving more people. Where the projects serve approximately the same number of people, preference 
shall be given to those serving more than one village, district, or county.
Sources and Uses of Funds
The REFUND will mobilize funding for rural and renewable energy services through the following 
mechanisms:
1. Domestic – Energy taxes, levies, and fees; general taxes; user fees and capital contributions;
voluntary corporate social responsibility contributions.
2. International – Traditional bilateral and multilateral loans and grants; carbon finance.
The three main uses of the REFUND will be:
1. Capacity building – This will be based on grant funding and includes support for the operating 
budget of the RREA, marketing and promotion of renewable energy technologies, and technical 
assistance (research and development, feasibility studies, business planning, training and 
development, etc.).
2. Project and consumer finance – This includes provision of grants to match community 
contributions for approved rural and renewable energy projects and programs; provision of 
subsidized loans for projects that cannot be funded through commercial financial services; provision 
of consumer loans through micro-credit financial institutions.
3. Risk management – This includes provision of partial or full guarantees for approved rural and 
renewable energy projects and programs that can be funded through commercial financial services 
but where the project promoters do not have the collateral needed.
Fund Management
The RREA will provide the day-to-day management for the REFUND. The RREA board will follow the 
standard procedures employed by commercial financial service providers in the processing of applications for 
funding. The management and staff of the RREA will include people trained to analyze projects and vet the 
creditworthiness and integrity of applicants. 
A Fund Management Committee will be established that will include non-board members selected for their 
expertise, interest, and commitment, for example representatives of donor organizations, senior executives,
and experts in financial services and technical experts in renewable energy technologies.6. INSTITUTIONAL AND
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
INSTITUTIONAL AND REGULATORY REFORM PRINCIPLES AND
OBJECTIVES
Energy Stakeholder Roles
The fundamental principle in establishing transparency, independence, and objectivity in decision making is 
separation of the roles of policy making, policy implementation, and policy monitoring. This is a principle 
which has been validated by many years of practice in national governance where there is a separation of the 
branches of government between the Legislature (law making), the Executive (law implementation), and the 
Judiciary (law interpretation). 
Policy making is concerned with the establishment and review of guiding principles. Energy policy making 
includes the development of energy master plans, pricing principles and quality standards, and the granting of 
investment and operating licenses and concessions. Policy monitoring is the process of ensuring compliance 
with the guiding principles, plans, and standards.
The process of making policies shall involve coordination of input from different stakeholders. Therefore the 
MLME shall, through its Policy and Planning Division, reconvene the National Energy Committee. Chaired
by the MLME, the NEC shall comprise relevant ministries and government agencies, NGOs, and 
development agencies. The NESF recommended the following – Ministries of Planning and Economic 
Affairs, Agriculture, Internal Affairs, Finance, Education, Health and Social Welfare, Labor, Commerce and 
Industry, Transport, and Gender and Development; LEC; NOCAL; LPRC; EPA; Forestry Development 
Authority; National Fire Service; Conservation International; Center for Sustainable Energy Technology; and 
international development agencies. Representatives of development agencies would not be involved in policy 
making but would be invited for their expertise and to share their countries’ experiences. 
Once policies, rules, and plans have been established, the actual implementation will be executed or 
supervised by the relevant sector agency and monitored by the ERB. While the ERB shall not make policies, 
plans, or standards, the board shall have the responsibility of interpreting and enforcing them – a process 
analogous to the functions of a judge in a court of law. The ERB shall, however, develop and recommend the 
procedures, guidelines, and regulations to be followed in implementing policy. The ERB shall also provide 
policy recommendations based on the experience gained in interpreting and enforcing policies and laws. The 
ERB shall therefore work closely with the MLME’s unit responsible for policy and planning. Annex 5
provides a diagrammatic representation of a typical operating framework for the ERB.
Ensuring Transparency and Good Governance Practices in the Energy Sector
Achieving transparency and good governance is probably the greatest challenge for the Government in the 
effort to enhance energy access through private sector investment. What is critical is the enforcement of rules 
and regulations designed to achieve transparency and good governance. Actions speak louder than words. 
Investors will make decisions on the basis of Government actions rather than on the basis of policies 
and rules written on paper. Examples of actions that Government will undertake to provide investor 
confidence include the following:
1. To ensure transparency and good governance of the ERB and public utilities, the appointment and 
reporting relationships of the boards and principal officers shall avoid conflict of interest by 
respecting the separation of stakeholder roles. Accordingly, the boards of the ERB and public utilities, which are policy monitoring and policy implementation bodies respectively, shall not 
comprise government ministers and other officials responsible for policy setting. The Government 
shall appoint independent people from the private sector with the relevant technical and managerial 
skills required. The boards shall be appointed by the President on the advice and recommendations 
of the Senate based on a shortlist submitted by the Minister responsible for energy.
2. Budgets for all sector agencies owned by the Government shall be submitted to the MoF through the 
MLME for approval. Once approved, the boards shall have the operational autonomy to utilize 
approved budgets, subject to periodic operational, financial, audit, and other reports which 
the regulatory body and the Minister may require for their policy monitoring and policy setting 
duties.
3. All evidence of corruption, abuse of office, and mismanagement of public resources shall 
result in immediate and non-discriminatory corrective action. Some of the more common 
abuses that are relevant to the energy sector include failure to adhere to procurement procedures, 
failure by Government and senior public officials to pay for energy services on time or at all, 
discrimination in application of disconnection policy, failure to enforce laws relating to the theft of 
service (electricity) or adulteration of products (petroleum), and failure to dismiss inefficient or 
corrupt public officials.
Improving the Financial Environment for Energy Sector Investments
This is an issue of communication because Liberia has a uniquely advantageous financial environment 
for energy sector investment due to the fact that the country’s long run marginal costs are lower than 
current prices – an unintended but advantageous consequence of the civil crisis. The usual situation is 
the other way around because developments are generally made on a least-cost basis, with the more expensive 
options being developed after the lower cost options have been exhausted. In many countries, the situation is 
made worse where the Government has been subsidizing energy prices. This means that the cost of new 
investments inevitably results in significant increases in prices and hence, there is usually a lot of political 
resistance to private sector investments as they are associated with increased prices. 
In Liberia, the civil crisis destroyed the low-cost energy options and people are now very much aware of the 
much higher cost of having to provide the energy through other means. Liberians with access to modern 
energy services are paying prices that are much higher than would be the case after significant investment into 
larger capacity generating units. This means that private sector investments will lower prices and 
enhance affordability thereby generating popular support or minimizing political resistance normally 
associated with the introduction of private sector investment and its requirement for cost-reflective 
prices.
The policy validation workshops also confirmed that there is a strong willingness and ability to pay for 
energy even among the very poor. This is because they are already paying high costs for inferior 
alternatives. People just need incentives to prioritize energy in their budgets. Again, emphasizing the key role 
of transparency and good governance, workshop delegates emphasized that people would happily mobilize 
their own financial resources if they had confidence in the integrity of the people and institutions handling the 
money.
STATEMENTS OF POLICY
1. It is the policy of the Government to provide an enabling legal and regulatory framework that 
will guarantee that an efficient operator can profitably provide affordable and 
environmentally-friendly energy services and products of the highest quality to the whole 
population.2. It is the policy of the Government to establish a transparent and independent regulatory 
process by separating the roles of policy setting, policy implementation, and policy 
monitoring.
3. It is the policy of the Government to vest the policy setting function in a department of 
energy that is resourced adequately to deal with all the sector and cross-cutting issues. Policy 
setting shall include the development of plans and licensing criteria as well as the issuing of 
licenses that are consistent with the plans and license criteria. For transparency, the plans 
and licensing criteria shall be made public as part of the regulatory body’s functions and the 
regulatory body shall adjudicate, with appeals to the courts if necessary, on any grievances 
arising from the licensing process.
4. In the granting of licenses, it is the policy of the Government to give preference to projects 
that provide maximum involvement and benefit to Liberian nationals and that take account 
of diversity and national interest.
5. It is the policy of the Government to vest the policy monitoring functions, involving 
examining and enforcing compliance with licenses, leases, concessions, plans, and 
standards, in an independent energy regulatory board established by law and whose 
principal objective will be to balance the interests of investors, consumers, and other 
stakeholders.
6. It is the policy of the Government to involve policy monitoring and implementation 
stakeholders in the policy making process and, towards this end, the Government shall 
establish a forum for multi-sector coordination through reconstituting the NEC.
RESTRUCTURING OF THE MINISTRY OF LANDS, MINES AND 
ENERGY
The current structure of the MLME is given in Annex 1. There are three Deputy Ministers responsible for 
administration, operations, and planning, respectively. Reporting to the Deputy Minister for Operations are 
four Assistant Ministers responsible for energy, lands, mines, and mineral exploration. This structure 
overburdens the Deputy Minister for Operations. The proposed structure in Annex 2 corrects this by 
elevating each of the core functions of the Ministry – lands, mines and energy – to the level of Department 
under the oversight of a Deputy Minister reporting directly to the Minister. It is however noted that there are 
proposed public sector reforms recommended by the Governance Commission which, if adopted, will result 
in the phasing out of the short-term political post of Assistant Minister. Annex 3 shows the new structure of 
the MLME assuming that the recommendations of the Governance Commission are adopted. The technical 
management of each Department shall then be undertaken by a Director reporting to a Principal 
Administrative Officer (PAO), both permanent civil service posts. The general financial and administrative 
support functions for the Ministry shall be undertaken by a Director reporting to the PAO. 
Although Annex 3 shows the Deputy Minister for Energy having oversight over the Energy as well as the 
Water and Environment Departments, the latter functions are currently under the oversight of the MLME’s 
minerals division. The appropriate location of these functions is a matter of policy that is outside the scope of 
this document. This NEP provides details on the energy department and the details of the other departments 
are separately addressed in the Lands Policy and Mines Policy respectively. The proposed structure of the 
energy department is in Annex 4. It is designed to ensure that there is adequate attention to all cross-cutting 
issues as well as those relating to each energy sector. With this structure there are clear reporting lines for all 
public utilities and other energy sector agencies.
Principal Administrative Officer for Lands, Mines and Energy
Under the proposed reorganization of the public service, a new position, Principal Administrative Officer for 
Lands, Mines and Energy, will be created, which reports directly to the Minister. The PAO, acting in accordance with authority delegated by the Minister, oversees the Ministry’s operational, financial, 
administrative, and other related functions of the GOL as defined in the NEP and supporting legislation. The 
PAO, who will be a permanent civil servant with relevant professional expertise and experience, will function 
as the Ministry’s Chief Executive Officer. The Minister, working in collaboration with the Deputy Ministers, 
shall function as the board of directors of the Ministry providing policy guidance and exercising general 
oversight responsibility in accordance with the applicable governing laws.
Director of Energy
The Director of Energy is a new position reporting to the PAO. The Director is the head of the Department 
of Energy, which is responsible for the following duties:
1. Policy development and planning – Development and review of energy policies, quality standards,
and master plans based on recommendations from all stakeholders; convening of National Energy 
Committee meetings; and liaising with the Energy Regulatory Board. 
2. Licensing – Coordination and administration of all support services required for the issuing of 
licenses and concessions in the sector; this includes but is not restricted to establishing licensing 
criteria and procedures with technical assistance from the government energy agencies, facilitating 
the processing of applications for investment and operating licenses.
3. Monitoring and evaluation – Measurement of the impacts and benefits of energy sector policies 
through regular reviews of government energy parastatal reports (budgets, operations, audits, policy 
recommendations, etc) as well as reviewing the activities of private players in the sector. 
In the processing and granting of licenses and concessions in the energy sector, the Director of Energy, 
supported by the relevant divisions and units of the energy department, shall be the principal adviser to the 
Minister, ensuring that the requirements of the Public Procurement and Concessions Act are followed. The 
MLME shall develop the rules, regulations and procedures for the issue of licenses and concessions and 
recommend for approval by the Public Procurement and Concessions Commission. Following approval the 
MLME shall ensure that these are well publicized.
The Department of Energy shall have at least three divisions managed by Assistant Directors – the Division
of Hydrocarbons with oversight responsibility over the petroleum sector, the Division of Electricity and 
Renewable Energy to look after the electricity sector and promote the development of renewable energy 
resources, and the Division of Energy Policy and Planning to look after all the cross-cutting issues.
DIVISION OF HYDROCARBONS
Purpose 
This division shall have the following principal functions:
1. Petroleum sector policy and plans – Development and review of policies, quality standards, and 
master plans for upstream and downstream operations.
2. Petroleum investment and operating licenses – With technical assistance from the government 
energy agencies and parastatals, establishing licensing criteria and procedures for upstream and 
downstream operations; processing of applications for investment and operating licenses.
3. Oversight responsibility over public and private sector operators in the sub-sector such as 
NOCAL, LPRC and the proposed successor company, the LNOC.
Due to human resources and financial constraints, and to avoid creating unnecessary central bureaucracy the 
division’s work shall start off by being handled in one office.Upstream Operations Unit
This unit is to be set up once the volume of work justifies the need for dedicated staff.
Downstream Operations Unit
This unit is to be set up once the volume of work justifies the need for dedicated staff.
DIVISION OF ELECTRICITY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY
Purpose 
This division shall have the following principal functions:
1. Electricity sector policy and plans – Development and review of policies, quality standards, and 
master plans for grid and off-grid and renewable energy investments. 
2. Licenses for generation, transmission, distribution, and supply of electricity – Establishing 
licensing criteria and procedures with technical assistance from the government energy agencies and 
parastatals.
3. Oversight responsibility over public and private sector operators in the sub-sector such as 
LEC, RREA, SPRA or LRA.
Due to human resources and financial constraints, and to avoid creating unnecessary central bureaucracy, the 
division’s work shall start off by being handled in one office.
Grid Power Unit
This unit is to be set up once the volume of work justifies the need for dedicated staff.
Off-Grid Power and Renewable Energy Unit
This unit is to be set up once the volume of work justifies the need for dedicated staff.
DIVISION OF ENERGY PLANNING AND POLICY
Purpose 
This division shall have the following principal functions:
1. Coordination of energy planning and policy development – Development and review of 
National Energy Policy and Energy Master Plan documents; convening and following up on 
recommendations from the National Energy Committee. 
2. Cross cutting issues – Energy efficiency, conservation and environment; gender issues.
3. Reporting for ERB – Liaison office for regulatory policy issues and recommendations; for 
independence, ERB’s operating reports and budgets shall be approved by an appropriate committee 
of the Legislature. This is because the ERB’s policy monitoring role includes oversight over the 
Executive Branch’s policy setting process.
Due to human resources and financial constraints, and to avoid creating unnecessary central bureaucracy, the 
division’s work shall start off being handled in one office.
Energy Planning and Policy Unit

This unit is to be set up once the volume of work justifies the need for dedicated staff.
ENERGY REGULATORY BOARD
Purpose 
Reporting to the Office of the President and the appropriate committee of the Legislature, the Energy 
Regulatory Board shall ensure a balance between stakeholder interests by monitoring the implementation of 
policies, plans, quality standards, and license provisions. The ERB shall discharge its mandate by undertaking 
the following principal functions:
1. Economic regulation – Monitoring of costs and enforcement of pricing principles; promoting fair 
competition and regional trade; making recommendations of pricing principles.
2. Technical regulation – Monitoring and enforcing of technical standards for products and services 
(safety, security, reliability, service responsiveness); recommending technical standards.
3. Dispute resolution – Consumer protection; investor protection; complaints handling; litigation.
4. Stakeholder relations – Information and publicity; administrative support services for the ERB.
Annex 5 shows the inter-linkages between the ERB and other stakeholder organizations. Due to the 
specialized nature of the skills that need to be developed, it is important to have the following four offices 
and functions, as a minimum:
Office of Economic Regulation
Cost monitoring and enforcing pricing principles – It is important to note that the ERB role is not to 
establish prices, because these are automatically established by the policy requirement for cost-reflective 
pricing. The role of the ERB is to ensure that only the minimum allowable costs plus a fair rate of return are 
passed on to the customer. This will be done by reviewing budgets and investment plans developed by the 
different sector agencies whose operations are subject to the ERB’s oversight. The rest of the economic 
regulatory functions can be added as capacity is built.
Office of Technical Regulation
Monitoring and enforcing of technical standards – The ERB will need to employ technical experts who 
are sufficiently knowledgeable in the different energy technologies to be able to assess the reasonableness of 
technical standards and to supervise technical studies by consultants hired by the ERB to review standards for 
energy products and services. The actual standards will be established by the Government as part of its policy 
making function. The Bureau of Standards will work with the Department of Energy in developing quality 
standards appropriate to the provision of energy products.
Office of Legal Affairs and Dispute Resolution
Dispute resolution – This is the Office that specializes in disputes related to the provision of energy services 
and products; appeals from the ERB are to be made to a competent court of law. Only questions relating to 
whether ERB acted in accordance with its charter shall be challenged in court. The Office shall also be 
involved in the drafting and review of laws and regulations and developing the procedures for the operation 
of the ERB.
Office of Administrative Services
Stakeholder relations – Information and publicity; support services for ERB operations.LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Purpose
The purpose is to provide clear and enforceable legal provisions to facilitate the implementation of the 
National Energy Policy.
New Energy Law
This is a law to promote the orderly development of the energy sector in accordance with the National 
Energy Policy and to establish the ERB, the body responsible for regulating the energy sector in accordance 
with the sector laws. It should be noted that similar regulatory bodies are also designated as an Authority, 
Agency, or Commission. The appropriate designation of the regulatory body shall be determined through 
stakeholder consultations during the legislative process.
New Electricity Law
The objective of the new law, which shall be a chapter of the Energy Law, is to regulate and promote the 
development of the electricity sector, to review the mandate of LEC in line with the National Energy Policy,
create the successor company to LEC, and to provide for the establishment of the SPRA or LRA at an 
appropriate time.
New Petroleum Law
The objective of the new law, which shall be a chapter of the Energy Law, is to regulate and promote the 
development of the petroleum sector and to review the mandate of NOCAL and LPRC in line with the 
National Energy Policy, create the successor company, the Liberia National Oil Corporation, at an
appropriate time.
New Renewable Energy Law
The objective of the new law, which shall be a chapter of the Energy Law, is to regulate and promote the 
development of the renewable energy sector and to establish the RREA and REFUND at an appropriate 
time.7. STRATEGIC ROADMAP
SMALL LIGHT TODAY, BIG LIGHT TOMORROW
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, in the dedication ceremony for the re-establishment of public power supply 
in Monrovia on July 26, 2006, summarized the strategic roadmap with the phrase “Small light today, big light 
tomorrow.” This NEP provides the way forward from the small light to the big light.
The small light has been made possible through grant funding and the Government’s own limited funds. In 
contrast, the bulk of the funds required for the big light will come from loans borrowed from banks. 
Therefore, while the small light has been a result of political and commercial decisions, the big light will be 
the result of decisions by banks. A decision to commit grant or equity funds is based on a balance of 
probabilities, analogous to the standard of proof in a civil court of law. A decision to commit debt funds is 
based on proof beyond reasonable doubt, analogous to the more onerous standard of proof in a criminal 
court of law. The focus of this NEP is to create the environment for bankable projects that will stand the 
exacting scrutiny and analysis by lenders. 
The Government has adopted a three-pronged strategy towards the realization of the vision outlined in the 
NEP – the short term (emergency phase), the medium term (capacity building phase), and the long term 
(development phase). The three phases are defined by the role that Liberians have been and shall be playing 
in the implementation of the energy policy. In the emergency phase, Liberians have been recipients of grant 
funds and technical and management expertise (the donors have been providing fish). In the capacity-building 
phase, the Government will focus on building local expertise and institutions to enable them to replicate the 
donor-funded managerial and technical expertise (donors will be teaching fishing). This expertise will then 
launch the country into the long-term development phase when the country expects to realize its vision of 
universal access to modern energy services for all (Liberians will be fishing for themselves).
STATEMENTS OF POLICY
1. It is the policy of the Government to keep its promises by undertaking all actions required to 
ensure visibility and maximum participation of Liberian stakeholders in the implementation 
of the NEP.
2. It is the policy of the Government to adopt an implementation timeline to serve as a 
reference for performance measurement in the implementation of the NEP.
EMERGENCY PHASE
The emergency phase was launched in January 2006 and is now coming to an end with the finalization of the 
National Energy Policy. Although during this phase several pilot projects have been implemented and a few 
individuals and communities have been able to benefit, the main achievement from a national point of view 
has been the development of this energy policy, which is to serve as an agenda for action. The projects and 
programs have provided lessons and support for the development of the NEP.
CAPACITY BULDING PHASE
The period 2008 to 2015 is for building local capacity for implementation of the energy policy. Significant 
donor assistance shall continue to be required during this phase and the projects to be implemented during 
this phase are expected to culminate in the achievement of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals as 
defined in the policy document. Some of the critical-path activities required to ensure the achievement of the 
targets that have been set are as follows:1. Drafting and enactment of enabling legislation – Many of the policy recommendations require 
an enforceable legal framework and therefore, the immediate task is to draft the appropriate laws and 
get the Legislature to enact them at the earliest opportunity.
2. Setting up appropriately resourced institutions – This activity can progress in parallel with the 
legislative work by beginning with prototypes. The role of the prototypes will be to coordinate and 
roll out emergency phase activities as capacity building for the official institutions. The prototypes are 
also an effective tool for communicating the Government’s commitment to the implementation of 
the energy policy. GOL has already initiated the process of setting up a prototype Rural and 
Renewable Energy Agency and Rural Energy Fund. A prototype Energy Regulatory Board can also 
be set up as another capacity building exercise. 
3. Development of energy master plans – Currently, there are a lot of uncoordinated donor-driven 
initiatives that, as a result, have a limited development impact. It is necessary to develop both grid 
and off-grid energy master plans, focused on both supply-side and demand-side options, in order to 
have an orderly and more effective national energy development program consistent with the 
principles and goals outlined in the NEP. One of the advantages of setting up the prototype 
institutions is to be able to immediately embark on the development of the master plans.
4. Facilitating the first major independent power producer investments – The Government has 
received proposals for medium-term power development projects that require immediate action to 
ensure their successful and timely implementation. An operationally efficient and financially viable 
transmission and distribution business in Monrovia is the minimum requirement for bankable IPP or 
utility development projects. These projects will require bank funding for at least 70% of project 
costs and IPPs and the utility will need to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that they will have 
the ability to deliver power and collect revenue from the end-users to pay into an escrow account for 
loan repayment. At present, the Government recognizes that LEC does not satisfy the requirements 
for a bankable power purchase agreement and therefore there is a need to attend to this deficiency as 
a matter of urgency.
5. Rehabilitation of petroleum storage and distribution infrastructure – Although LPRC is 
operating profitably, its operations are based on infrastructure that is in serious and urgent need of 
rehabilitation. The Government does not have the capital required and needs to urgently mobilize 
significant private sector investment. The Government must translate its stated policy of involving 
the private sector to the greatest degree possible by taking immediate action to facilitate the private 
sector investment required to rehabilitate storage tanks and pipelines.
6. Allocation of all vacant petroleum exploration blocks – It is important for the GOL to establish 
conclusively whether or not the country has commercially exploitable oil and natural gas resources. It 
is therefore essential to grant exploration licenses for all the vacant off-shore blocks at the earliest 
possible opportunity. 
7. Rehabilitation of Mount Coffee – This is a project that is required to lay the foundation for the 
large hydropower developments along the Saint Paul River and the other major rivers, which are 
needed to provide more affordable power for the country. It will be a challenging exercise for the 
developers to raise the capital required, and the starting point will again be a bankable power 
purchase arrangement.
DEVELOPMENT PHASE
The development phase is expected to be the period beyond 2015, which will build upon the achievements of 
the capacity building phase. Assuming that the policies and principles outlined in the NEP are followed, by 
that time the new institutions, such as RREA and the ERB, and the restructured public utilities and 
companies, will be fully resourced with skilled and experience people. The projects and programs implemented during the emergency and capacity building phases will lead to improvements in energy access 
in the medium term. Once the system is stabilized and the economy resumes a reasonable rate of growth, the 
Government can look at longer-term options such as development of the country’s large-scale hydropower 
potential, the creation of public-private partnerships for exploiting opportunities for imports and exports of 
electricity either directly with neighboring countries or via the West African Power Pool, and the 
development of the country’s other vast renewable energy resources.ANNEX 1. CURRENT ORGANIZATION CHART
