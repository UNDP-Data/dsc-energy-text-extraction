tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
The government of the Kingdom of Bahrain is committed to the sustainability of the 
country’s natural resources for future generations, as well as the protection of the 
environment. There is considerable potential for undertaking energy efficiency and 
renewable energy initiatives in Bahrain, which will extend the lifetime of oil and gas 
reserves, and enable long-term sustainable development. Bahrain’s Economic Vision 
2030 puts special emphasis on providing incentives for reducing and managing electricity 
demand, and investing in clean energy technologies; promoting energy efficiency 
standards to ensure sustainability; and ensuring better energy and water demand 
management. 
Progress has already been achieved, indeed Bahrain has been a pioneer on the way to a 
more sustainable future. The Kingdom was one of the first countries to install utility-scale 
wind turbines on a new commercial development, the iconic World Trade Center in 2008; 
and Bahrain was the first country in the GCC to have a district cooling system. There are 
already several private sector renewable energy systems in operation; and a number of 
initiatives are underway to facilitate more efficient energy use.
In order to unify and consolidate efforts on energy efficiency and renewable energy, 
the Sustainable Energy Unit was established in November 2014. The Sustainable Energy 
Unit is mandated to develop strategies and policies for the integrated planning of 
energy sources in the Kingdom, as well as the rationalization of energy use, and to 
raise efficiency in all sectors through coordination with all concerned parties. To this end, 
the Sustainable Energy Unit, in consultation with key stakeholders, has formulated the 
National Renewable Energy Action Plan and the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, 
which were endorsed by the Cabinet (resolution no. 2384-08). 
These plans are an important milestone in setting out Bahrain’s national targets for 
renewable energy deployment and the adoption of energy efficiency initiatives. As 
such, they represent the Kingdom’s efforts to deliver the sustainable energy transition 
envisioned in the Economic Vision 2030 and the Government Action Plan 2015-2018. 
The plans also represent the implementation of the Kingdom’s regional and international 
commitments under the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals, and the League of Arab States Renewable Energy Framework and Guidelines on 
Energy Efficiency. 
The initiatives within the plans, with the support of leadership across all ministries, and 
from key stakeholders and members of society, will enable the Kingdom’s sustainable 
future. By working together, Bahrain can achieve its sustainable energy objectives, which 
will benefit the Kingdom economically and environmentally.

tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
In recognition of both the need and potential to diversify Bahrain’s energy sector to 
include renewable sources, and to develop innovative ways to ensure the most efficient 
use of energy, the UNDP has been working with the Government of Bahrain for a number 
of years to respond to the important issue of sustainable energy. The UNDP is delighted 
to support the Office of the Minister of Electricity and Water Affairs in establishing the 
Sustainable Energy Unit, for the benefit of the people of Bahrain, and to further the 
sustainable development of the country. 
The publication of the National Renewable Energy Action Plan and the National Energy 
Efficiency Plan is an important milestone in Bahrain’s national development. The 
leadership of the Kingdom of Bahrain is to be applauded for taking active steps towards 
a sustainable future. 
The plans align closely with the framework of the UN Secretary General’s Sustainable 
Energy for All (SE4All) Initiative that supports universal access to modern energy services, 
acceleration in energy efficiency improvements, and the increased use of renewable 
energy in the energy mix.
It also supports the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which includes the 
United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals for social progress, economic growth 
and environmental protection. By focusing on renewable energy and energy efficiency, 
the Kingdom of Bahrain is supporting the realization of the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goal No. 7: Ensuring acess to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern 
energy for all. 
The Bahraini National Renewable Energy Action Plan and the National Energy Efficiency 
Action Plan are on par with similar initiatives in other Arab countries, and will help to 
promote the exchange of successful international experiences for the benefit of Bahrain’s 
ambitious development agenda. 
To achieve these objectives, the UNDP will facilitate access to expertise from within the UN 
system and the international energy community. Most importantly, the plans will become 
a building block to achieve Bahrain’s Economic Vision 2030 and has energy efficiency 
and renewable energy as top priorities. This vision marks a new era of development 
and modernization for the Kingdom of Bahrain and the UNDP will continue to support 
Bahrain’s leadership in implementing these important sustainable energy initiatives.

BACKGROUND
The Kingdom of Bahrain has witnessed significant growth over the past two decades, GDP 
has grown by almost 5% per year, driven by an increasingly diversified economy and an 
educated population, as well as substantial investment in infrastructure. Bahrain is classified 
as a high-income country, with per capita wealth in 2015 double the world average. The 
Kingdom’s economic growth has been underpinned by a secure energy system, which has 
seen a corresponding growth in energy demand.
Over the past twenty years, Bahrain’s total primary energy supply grew by 4.2%, total final 
energy consumption grew by 5.3%, and non-industrial electricity consumption grew by 6.6% 
per year. This growth has placed increasing strain on the energy system. Today the Kingdom’s 
power generation system relies exclusively on natural gas, which is a scarce and diminishing 
resource. Current projections on the availability of gas reserves suggest that Bahrain will no 
longer be able to meet its domestic consumption, and will have to rely on imported gas as 
early as 2018. An increased reliance on imported energy is highly likely to mean an increase 
in energy prices for consumers. 
Ensuring the availability of oil and gas for future generations, and reducing the growth in 
Bahrain’s CO2 emissions, requires resources to be consumed as efficiently as possible. Bahrain 
has high potential to realize multiple benefits from a national energy efficiency programme. 
Pursuing energy efficiency can help the Kingdom to stimulate more efficient use of electricity 
and optimize the use of indigenous gas resources, decrease peak electricity demand, and 
promote investment, employment and innovation in energy efficient products and services.
The government of Bahrain has taken a number of critical steps to shift the country towards 
more efficient consumption of energy. It has implemented electricity and transport subsidy 
reforms, and introduced important regulations, such as minimum energy performance 
standards for air conditioners and lighting products. 
The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) builds on existing achievements, and 
includes a comprehensive set of initiatives to unlock further energy efficiency potential in 
the Kingdom. The Plan identifies specific programs and new initiatives across various sectors, 
and encompasses energy efficiency plans developed by individual institutions. The Plan sets 
a national target for energy savings, identifies implementing mechanisms, and provides 
estimates of energy and monetary savings. 
The Plan is in line with the Economic Vision 2030 and the Government Action Plan 2015-2018, 
which call for conservation of natural resources through implementing energy efficiency 
programs. It also represents the implementation of the Kingdom’s regional and international Goals, and the League of Arab States Guidelines on Energy Efficiency. 
The NEEAP has been prepared by the Sustainable Energy Unit (SEU) which reports directly to 
HE Minister of Electricty and Water affairs through broad consultation with key stakeholder 
groups, including the Electricity and Water Authority; the National Oil and Gas Authority; the 
Ministry of Housing; the Ministry of Works, Urban Planning and Municipalities; the Ministry 
of Industry, Commerce and Tourism; the Supreme Council for the Environment; the Bahrain 
Defense Force; large industry groups; and academia.
TARGET
A comprehensive process of consultation and engagement was undertaken to determine a 
feasible national energy efficiency target for Bahrain. Based on a balance between technical 
and economic potential, and taking into account institutional capacity to deliver energy 
savings, a national target of 6% has been adopted. The target is set as a reduction of 
energy consumption in the year 2025, expressed as a percentage of the average final energy 
consumption during the baseline period (2009-2013).consumption during the baseline 
period (2009-2013).
BENEFITS AND IMPACT
Pursuing energy efficiency can help Bahrain to stimulate more efficient use of electricity 
and optimize the use of indigenous gas resources, decrease peak electricity demand, and 
promote investment, employment and innovation in energy efficient products and services. 
The expected outcomes from the NEEAP will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make the 
economy more competitive, and improve energy security in the long-term. 
Achieving the 6% national energy efficiency target will result in:
- Energy savings of 5,800 GWh on a primary energy equivalent basis in year 
2025
- Cumulative government monetary savings of BHD 82 million 
- Avoided investments in electricity generation of BHD 172 million 
- Anticipated financial impact of BHD 230 million, after deducting the cost of 
implementation
- Cumulative reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 3.4 million tonnes of 
CO2 
The target and savings in GWh are calculated on a Primary Energy Equivalent (PEE) basis, and 
includes transportindustryand electricity supply as sectors covered under the Plan Kingdom of Bahrain
tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
To achieve the national target, and realize energy and monetary savings, a total of 22 
initiatives are included within the Plan. The initiatives cover all sectors of the economy, and 
target efficiency improvements in both energy supply and demand, as shown in Figure 1.

SEU under the guidance of the Minister of Electricity and Water Affairs will lead the 
coordination of the implementation of the Plan. SEU will also act as the ‘national mandated 
entity’ for the purposes of reporting under the Arab Guidelines on Energy Efficiency.1.1 OIL AND GAS
The Kingdom of Bahrain has witnessed significant growth over the past two decades, GDP 
has grown by almost 5% per year, driven by an increasingly diversified economy and an 
educated population, as well as substantial investment in infrastructure. Bahrain is classified 
as a high-income country, with per capita wealth double the world average in 2015. The 
Kingdom’s economic growth has been underpinned by a secure energy system, which has 
seen a corresponding growth in energy demand. Over the past twenty years, Bahrain’s 
total primary energy supply grew by 4.2%, total final energy consumption grew by 5.3%, 
and electricity consumption excluding industry grew by 6.6% per year [1]. This growth has 
placed increasing strain on the energy system. 
To meet domestic energy demand, Bahrain relies entirely on its indigenous hydrocarbon 
resources. In 2014, Bahrain’s total energy consumption came from two sources: oil (17%) 
and natural gas (83%). Bahrain was the first country in the GCC region to discover oil reserves 
in 1932, crude oil production reached its peak in 1970, and since then it has been gradually 
declining. In 2014, crude oil production amounted to 202,000 barrels a day [2], and at 
current production levels, the oil reserves have a projected lifetime of around 11 years.
Natural gas is the backbone of the energy system and economy of Bahrain. It is the sole 
energy source for Bahrain’s power and water generation. Natural gas is also economically 
critical for the operation of the Kingdom’s industries. Today all natural gas is used for domestic 
consumption: 41% by the manufacturing sector; 33% for power and water generation; 
and 25% is re-injected for enhanced oil recovery [3]. The projected lifetime of natural gas 
reserves is around 15 years. Current projections on the availability of gas reserves suggest 
that Bahrain will no longer be able to meet its domestic consumption, and will have to 
rely on imported gas as early as 2018, at an expected price higher than that currently 
paid by Bahrain’s gas users. Ensuring the availability of oil and gas for future generations, 
and reducing the growth in Bahrain’s CO2 emissions, requires resources to be consumed as 
efficiently as possible. 
To realize Bahrain’s Economic Vision 2030, the government has adopted a policy of 
diversifying the economy. Figure 2 shows how the Kingdom’s economy has transitioned 
from a dominant hydrocarbon sector to a more diversified economy, over the period to 2014. 
However, the relatively limited hydrocarbon exports continue to be one of the main sources 
of national income. In 2014, oil & gas extraction was the largest contributor to GDP (around 
24%), followed by financial services (16%) and manufacturing (around 15%) [4]. Currently, 
Bahrain has developed the most diversified economy in the GCC region. The three fastest 
growing sectors over the past decade were social and personal services; construction; and 
transportation and communication. Kingdom of Bahrain

1.2 ENERGY INTENSITY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
The energy sector in Bahrain remains the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the 
Kingdom, contributing 77% to total emissions [5]. Figure 3 shows Bahrain’s CO2 emissions 
per capita over the last fifty years [6]. Although Bahrain makes relatively minor contributions 
to global greenhouse gas emissions, Bahrain’s per capita emissions are amongst the highest 
in the world and continue to trend upwards. In 2013, Bahrain’s per capita CO2 emissions were 
twice the average of the high-income country, and almost five times higher than the world 
average. Relatively high per capita emissions are attributed to Bahrain’s small land size, 
population density, harsh climate conditions, scarcity of water resources, and heavy reliance 
on energy intensive desalination plants [5]. Implementing energy efficiency and renewable 
energy policies has high potential to reduce the Kingdom’s greenhouse gas emissions.

1.3 POWER SECTOR
In 2014, the Kingdom had 6,204 MW of installed electricity generation capacity. Of this, 
2,274 MW are captive power plants, owned and operated by large industry groups such as 
Alba, BAPCO and GPIC. Independent power and water producers (IWPPs) own and operate 
3,100 MW, and EWA owns and operates 825 MW [9]. In addition, Bahrain can import and 
export electricity through its 600 MW capacity interconnection with the GCC Interconnection 
Authority. Power produced by captive power plants is consumed on site by large industry 
groups. Power produced by the IWPPs and EWA is distributed and sold to customers by EWA. 
EWA is the sole body responsible for electricity transmission, distribution, and grid operation.
In 2014, the Kingdom consumed 24,705 GWh. Grid electricity supplied by EWA accounted for 
15,186 GWh, or 66% of total electricity consumption. The remaining 34% was generated and 
consumed by large industry. The residential sector uses most of the grid electricity, at 46% 
of total grid consumption, as shown in Figure 5. The commercial sector is the second-largest 
user accounting for 36.4%, followed by industry at 17.3%. Kingdom of Bahrain

Despite the global trend for consumption per capita to decrease, with per capita electricity 
consumption of 19,592 kWh in 2014, Bahrain remains in the top five countries with the

Bahrain’s high consumption figures are a result of the energy system being characterized by 
the large presence of energy intensive industries such as aluminum smelting, oil refining, 
petrochemicals, and steel. Many of these industries have their own captive power plants. 
Industry accounts for (41%) of final energy consumption, followed by the transport sector 
(31%), the residential sector (18%), and the government sector (11%) [1].
Grid electricity consumption grew from 5,516 GWh in 2000, to 15,186 GWh in 2014 (an 
annual average growth rate of 7.5%) [9]. With the current projections of population growth, 
economic development, and expansion of industries, the demand for energy will increase. 
EWA has projected electricity demand for 2020 and 2030 under three growth scenarios 
starting from 2013: low, medium, and high, depicted in Figure 8. According to these 
projections under the low growth scenario the demand for grid-supplied electricity will 
reach 21,700 GWh in 2030, under the medium growth scenario demand will nearly double 
reaching 28,180 GWh, and under the high scenario demand will reach 34,550 GWh in 2030.

Similar to other GCC countries, Bahrain has a large seasonal variation in electricity consumption. 
Due to very hot summers, electricity consumption during the months from May to October 
increases significantly. This is mainly due to the heavy use of AC units, which account for 
60%-65% of electricity usage in buildings. In 2014, the highest peak electricity consumption 
occurred in August (1,720 GWh) and the lowest electricity consumption occurred in January 
(701 GWh) [9]. Total electricity consumption in August was two and a half times higher 
electricity consumption in January.
Aside from seasonal peaks, Bahrain also has daily electricity consumption peaks. Bahrain 
has two daily peaks: the first peak occurs between 11:00 and 16:00, and the second occurs 
between 18:00 and 19:00. On a typical summer day (30 August 2015), the first peak 
consumption occurred at 13:39 reaching 3,441 MW, and the second peak occurred at 18:36 
reaching 3,189 MW. These numbers are compared with electricity consumption during a 
typical winter day (30 January 2015), when the first peak occurred at 12:06 reaching 1,137 
MW, and the second peak occurred at 18:09 reaching 1,208 MW [9].
To meet peak demand, the government needs to maintain extra generation capacity, which 
is a costly activity. According to the World Bank analysis of the 2014 demand curve, the 
network required an additional 500 MW which operates for less than 50 hours a year. The 
estimated cost to the government to maintain 500 MW over a 20-year period is over USD 600 
million. This amount excludes fuel costs of producing electricity, and variable operation and 
maintenance costs [8]. Energy efficiency initiatives can contribute to significantly reducing 
peak load demand.
1.5 COST OF ENERGY
As the population continues to grow, and the limited amount of fossil fuels begins to 
diminish, it may not be possible for Bahrain to meet its growing energy demand without 
relying on imported energy. Bahrain is already planning to import natural gas as early as 
2018, and steps are underway to complete the construction of an LNG import facility. An 
increased reliance on imported energy is highly likely to mean an increase in energy prices 
for consumers.
In anticipation of the diminishing gas supply, the government adopted a new gas pricing 
policy in 2015. Under this policy, the price of natural gas sold to domestic companies will 
increase by USD 0.25 per MMbtu each year on 1 April. The pricing policy will be reviewed 
when the price reaches USD 4 per MMbtu by 1 April 2021 [3]. The first price increase 
took place on 1 April 2015, from USD 2.25 to 2.50 per MMbtu. Adopting energy efficiency 
policies will help Bahrain reduce its reliance on imported energy, prolong the lifetime of the 
indigenous natural gas resource, and optimize its economic value. This approach will improve 
energy security in the long-term and will have a positive impact on Bahrain’s economic generation largely depends on the gas price. The current cost of power generation is 22 
fils/kWh. Electricity transmission costs 3.3 fils/kWh, and distribution costs 3.7 fils/kWh. 
Therefore, it costs 29 fils/kWh for EWA to supply power to end customers. This cost is based 
on a natural gas price of USD 2.5 per MMbtu. As the cost of natural gas will increase by USD 
0.25 per year, the cost of electricity supply will also increase. According to estimations, the 
cost of electricity supply (including transmission and distribution costs) from natural gas 
could increase to 36 fils/kWh by 2020, based on the planned gas price increases.
Up until recently electricity and water tariffs were subsidized. Effective from 1 March 2016, 
new electricity and water tariffs have been applied to electricity and water consumers, in 
accordance with the new tariff schedule announced by EWA. The electricity tariffs will be 
gradually increased to meet the cost of power generation of 29 fils/kWh by 2019. The new 
tariffs are applicable to all residential, commercial and industrial consumers. Bahraini citizens 
holding a single EWA account are exempt from tariff increases [10].

2.1 INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS
THE PARIS AGREEMENT
In December 2015, the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change took place in Paris (COP21). As a result, 195 nations adopted 
the Paris Agreement to take action toward holding the increase of global average temperature 
to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement is a historic agreement 
tbt lithd lttid ittdd ftiblsupport through publication of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in 
November 2015 [11].
The INDC is an official pledge by the Kingdom to support the global efforts in combating 
climate change by taking specific actions to reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. 
Energy efficiency and renewable energy represent key initiatives in Bahrain’s INDC, as both 
hold great potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as to promote sustainable 
development.
THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
In September 2015, at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, world leaders 
officially adopted a new agenda entitled “Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development.” The new global agenda includes 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets. The SDGs represent a consensus of the 193 member states of 
the United Nations to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure the prosperity for all. SDG 
7 calls on countries to “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy 
for all.” [12]. This goal is supported by five targets to be achieved by 2030:
- Ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services
- Increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix
- Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency
- Enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research 
and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and 
cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and 
clean energy technology
- Expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable 
energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed 
countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in 
accordance with their respective programs of support.
The government of the Kingdom of Bahrain embraced the challenge of meeting the 
Millennium Development Goals by 2015, and expressed its commitment to the post-2015 
development agenda process at the press conference in the UN Sustainable Development 
Summit held on 20 September 2015. Kingdom of Bahrain
tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
In November 2010, the Arab Ministerial Council for Electricity of the League of Arab States 
adopted “The Arab Guideline for Improving Electricity Efficiency and Rationalizing its 
Consumption at The End User” [13]. The main purpose of the Guidelines is to promote the costeffective improvement of end use electricity in Arab countries (efficiency and conservation) 
through guidance, methodologies and templates for setting an energy efficiency target and 
developing energy efficiency measures.
The Guidelines mandate the member states to develop National Energy Efficiency Action 
Plans (NEEAPs) to achieve comprehensive energy savings by 2020. The Guidelines prescribe 
Arab country member states to:
- Disclose key indicators and set an energy efficiency indicative target calculated in 
accordance with the methodology in Annex “a” (Article III) 
- Identify suitable energy efficiency measures to achieve the target (Article III:1)
- Assign responsibility to an entity for overall control of the NEEAP (Article III:2)
- Ensure an exemplary role of public sector (Chapter III)
- Ensure that energy distributors, distribution system operators and retail energy 
companies contribute to energy efficiency through various measures (Article V)
- Ensure that information about energy efficiency measures and mechanism reaches 
the relevant stakeholders (Article VI)
- Revise national legislation impeding or restricting the use of financial instruments 
(Article VIII)
- Consider restructuring electricity tariffs to encourage energy efficiency (Article IX)
- Provide necessary financial resources to support energy efficiency measures (Article X)
- Ensure availability of effective programs for energy audit services by independent 
bodies such as energy service companies or electric power distribution companies. (XI) 
This Plan is drafted in accordance with the requirements of the Arab Guidelines. The target is 
calculated in accordance with the suggested methodology. The Plan ensures the exemplary 
role of the government sector and designates the SEU as the national mandated agency 
responsible for the preparation of the NEEAP.Pursuing energy efficiency is not only an international commitment of Bahrain, but also of 
national importance and is in line with the Kingdom’s Economic Vision 2030. Economic Vision 
2030 recognizes economic, social, and environmental sustainability as its key principles. It 
indicates explicitly that economic growth must never come at the expense of the environment 
and the long-term well-being of the people. Furthermore, it calls for implementing energy 
efficiency regulations and investment in technologies that reduce carbon emissions, minimize 
pollution and promote sustainable energy [14]. In clear recognition of the benefits of energy 
efficiency, Bahrain is committed to foster the development of low-carbon energy initiatives 
by unlocking the Kingdom’s energy efficiency potential. 
In 2015, the government adopted the Government Action Plan 2015-2018 to deliver 
sustainable change in line with the Economic Vision 2030. The Government Action Plan reflects 
Bahrain’s strategic priorities over the next four years and seeks to capitalize on the Kingdom’s 
resources and capabilities to meet the needs of all Bahrainis. Under the “Environment and 
Urban Development” pillar, the government made commitments to improve the efficiency 
of electricity and water consumption [15]. To achieve this, the government will seek to 
- Increase education and awareness to reduce the waste of electricity and water;
- Adjust the cost of services and encourage the take up of technologies geared 
towards rationalization;
- Work on the adoption of smart distribution mechanisms, where possible and 
appropriate, in order to improve the management of energy and water resources;
- Develop building regulations to contribute to the rationalization of electricity 
consumption in all new buildings.
2.3 SUSTAINABLE ENERGY UNIT
In November 2014, under Cabinet Resolution 4/2238, the government established the 
Sustainable Energy Unit (SEU) to lead and promote sustainable energy policies and practices 
in the Kingdom of Bahrain. SEU was established under the office of the Minister of Energy 
with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) [16]. Due to the 
broad central government restructuring in summer 2016, SEU became one of the initiatives 
governed by the Office of the Minister of Electricity and Water Affairs.
The key objectives of SEU are to develop a cohesive sustainable energy policy framework to 
promote renewable energy, energy efficiency, and conservation in the country. SEU will also 
work towards bridging the legal, institutional, and capacity gaps in order for Bahrain’s energy 
sector to meet future challenges. Kingdom of Bahrain
tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan

institutions in achieving goals as stated in the Bahrain Economic Vision 2030; 
- Supporting the creation of an enabling environment for energy efficiency and 
renewable energy technology transfer, and private sector investments;
- Supporting the development of necessary policies, regulations, and standards 
across various sectors;
- Promoting replication and up-scaling of successful pilot projects and initiatives 
across the Kingdom;
- Strengthening national capacity on the deployment of renewable energy and 
energy efficiency technologies;
- Coordinating the implementation of national, regional, and international 
obligations relating to energy efficiency and renewable energy; and 
- Raising public awareness on the benefits of energy efficiency and renewable

The NEEAP represents one of the key components of the Kingdom’s efforts to implement 
its national, regional, and international commitments in the field of energy efficiency and 
climate change mitigation. It identifies feasible energy efficiency initiatives, sets the national 
target, and proposes policies and actions to unlock Bahrain’s energy efficiency potential. 
SEU under the guidance of the Minister of Electricity and Water Affairs will lead the 
coordination of the implementation of the Plan. SEU will also act as the ‘national mandated 
entity’ under the Arab Guidelines on Energy Efficiency. Kingdom of Bahrain
tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
3.1 INTRODUCTION
Energy efficiency means using less energy for the same output or service, and in some cases 
the service can be improved (for example, the replacement of incandescent lamps with 
LEDs reduces energy consumption and produces fewer emissions, and also provides higher 
quality lighting). Energy efficiency is considered to be the first fuel by the International 
Energy Agency [17], a preferred source of energy that should be utilized ahead of other 
more costly sources, such as investing in new capacity. It has a key role in ensuring the 
competitiveness of businesses, in terms of financial and environmental considerations, by 
way of productivity gains throughout the economy, as a result of more efficient resource use 
and lower greenhouse gas emissions.
The practical aspect of energy efficiency is to reduce energy consumption, without degrading 
the quality of the final services or products, and it very often results in tangible monetary 
savings that can be used for other purposes. In the case of industry, energy efficiency 
initiatives improve productivity and competitiveness, and can reduce exposure to energy 
price volatility. For households, energy efficiency frees money for spend on other goods and 
services, or for savings and investments.
Bahrain has high potential to realize multiple benefits from a national energy efficiency 
programme. Pursuing energy efficiency can help the Kingdom to stimulate more efficient 
use of electricity and optimize the use of indigenous gas resources, decrease peak electricity 
demand, and promote investment, employment and innovation in energy efficient products 
and services.
The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan represents one of the key components of the 
Kingdom’s efforts to implement its national, regional, and international commitments in 
the field of sustainable energy development and climate change. It takes a multi-pronged 
approach and builds on existing achievements, and presents a comprehensive set of 
initiatives to further unlock Bahrain’s energy efficiency potential across its economy. The 
Plan identifies specific programs and new initiatives for all sectors, and encompasses energy 
efficiency plans developed by individual institutions. 
The Plan sets a national target for energy savings, identifies implementing mechanisms, and 
provides estimates of energy and monetary savings. It encourages government to act as an 
exemplar, and in doing so, it provides the necessary guidance and leadership for all related 
parties. The initiatives encompass primary energy savings and end-use measures. A variety 
of policy mechanisms will be utilized as appropriate to deliver the national energy efficiency 
target, such as minimum energy performance standards and labeling, an energy efficiency 
building code, energy management in buildings, electricity and fuel price reforms, sectoral 
targets, as well as awareness raising and training. groups including the Electricity and Water Authority; the National Oil and Gas Authority; the 
Ministry of Housing; the Ministry of Works, Urban Planning and Municipalities; the Ministry 
of Industry and Commerce; the Supreme Council for the Environment, the Bahrain Defense 
Force; large industry groups; and academia. 
3.2 CONSOLIDATING EXISTING EFFORTS
The NEEAP draws together initiatives identified in ”The EWA Energy Efficiency Action Plan 
for the Kingdom of Bahrain 2015-2020 (EWA-EEAP)”, and the “Kingdom of Bahrain Energy 
Efficiency Program (KEEP)” prepared by the World Bank in 2016, on behalf of the Ministry of 
Finance. Energy efficiency initiatives in Bahrain’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 
submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [11] have also 
been incorporated into this Plan. 
In order to ensure coordination and that all relevant sectors are addressed, the NEEAP 
also includes initiatives to improve energy efficiency in other sectors as well, such as 
setting minimum vehicle emission standards for the transport sector, and the NEEAP also 
encompasses improving efficiency in electricity supply.
EWA ENERGY EFFICIENCY ACTION PLAN
In 2016, the Electricity and Water Authority (EWA) published the EWA-EEAP [18], the key 
measures of which have been directly incorporated into this Plan. As noted in the foreword 
to the EWA plan, “…this Plan includes 8 independent but correlated measures in the field 
of energy efficiency with respect to the various sectors of energy consumption. EWA-EEAP 
aims to achieve an indicative target for energy efficiency of 19% of the total expected 
electricity consumption in the year 2020, taking into consideration the present total electricity 
consumption and a consumption growth rate of 7%.” Achievement of the savings set out 
in the EWA-EEAP will make a significant contribution to achieving Bahrain’s national energy 
efficiency target. The 19% reduction equates to 4,394 GWh of savings (measured on a final 
energy basis).
In addition to taking responsibility for the delivery of a number of the important initiatives 
captured under the NEEAP, EWA has a critical role in the collection of data, to enable the 
calculation of savings delivered under this Plan. 
THE KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM 
KEEP [8] was developed by a World Bank team in close coordination with key stakeholders, 
and under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance. It sets out several initiatives to reduce 
electricity consumptionin the residentialcommercialgovernmentand SME sectors Kingdom of Bahrain
tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
it excludes production and transmission. It sets a 20% national target for energy efficiency 
improvements by the year 2030, as well as a pathway for the design, implementation, and 
evaluation of 15 energy efficiency initiatives. KEEP provides the overall strategy and highlevel design of the draft initiatives for the electricity sector. Those initiatives commencing 
prior to 2020 have been incorporated into the NEEAP.
BAHRAIN’S INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION
Bahrain is a party to the Paris Agreement, and expressed its support through publication 
of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in November 2015 [11]. Several 
energy efficiency initiatives from the EWA-EEAP are included in the INDC, as well as key 
transport initiatives and those from large industry. These initiatives have been incorporated 
into the NEEAP.
3.3 ENERGY BASELINE AND KEY INDICATORS
According to the Arab Guidelines [13], the energy efficiency target should be expressed both 
as a percentage of the baseline consumption and specific GWh to be saved. Calculation of 
the baseline energy consumption should be the average amount of energy consumed during 
the last five years prior to adopting the NEEAP. To better characterize the baseline energy 
situation in Bahrain, the energy balance statistics compiled by International Energy Agency 
(IEA) have been used as a source [1]. The NEEAP takes the average of the last five years of 
published IEA energy balance data (2009-2013) for the Kingdom of Bahrain as the baseline 
period. 
The target and savings in GWh are calculated on a Primary Energy Equivalent (PEE) basis, 
and includes transport, industry, and electricity supply as sectors covered under the Plan. PEE 
takes into account conversion losses in electricity generation and makes units of different 
energy streams (kWh of electricity, cubic feet of gas, and liters of gasoline) more comparable. 
A key principle underpinning the Plan is that all sectors of the economy should, if possible, 
contribute to the NEEAP.
According to IEA data [1], Bahrain uses almost three-quarters of its primary energy for 
electricity production, energy industry own use (includes gas reinjection) and non-energy 
use (such as to produce chemicals) as shown in Figure 11, resulting in total final consumption1
1 In the IEA energy balance, conversion of natural gas into chemicals is included in total final energy consumption. 
Bahrain converts a large percentage of its natural gas into chemicals, therefore there is a large difference electricity production system, and the reinjection of a relatively large quantity of gas to 
support enhanced oil recovery.

3.4 THE NATIONAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY TARGET
A comprehensive process of consultation and engagement was undertaken to determine a 
feasible national energy efficiency target for Bahrain. Based on a balance between technical 
and economic potential, and taking into account institutional capacity to deliver energy 
savings, a national target of 6% has been adopted. The target is set as a reduction of 
energy consumption in the year 2025, expressed as a percentage of the average final energy 
consumption during the baseline period (2009-2013). 
3.5 PROJECTED ENERGY SAVINGS
To achieve the national energy efficiency target, and realize energy savings, a total of 22 
initiatives are set out in the Plan. The initiatives cover all sectors of the economy, and target 
efficiency improvements in energy supply and demand. As shown in Table 3, the initiatives 
are expected to collectively produce energy savings of 5,800 GWh on a primary energy 
equivalent basis in the year 2025, which is considered prudent given realized outcomes in 
other jurisdictions (including rebound effects). Table 3

design process and upon receipt of updated data from the key stakeholders. Developments 
among League of Arab States’ members to harmonize calculation methodologies will also 
inform this process. SEU, in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders, will report back to the 
government of Bahrain on progress towards achieving the national energy efficiency target. Kingdom of Bahrain
tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
To achieve the national target, and realize energy and monetary savings, the initiatives 
cover all sectors of the economy and target efficiency improvements in energy supply and 
demand, as summarized in Figure 14. This chapter presents a description of the initiatives 
and the accompanying implementation plan for each initiative, grouped by sector.
Figure 14: Overview of Energy Efficiency Initiatives per Sector
4.1 RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL
OVERVIEW
Buildings consume nearly 40% of energy demand and account for around one third of 
greenhouse gas emissions globally. Energy efficiency initiatives deployed in buildings have 
long lasting implications because buildings last for 40-50 years or more. As such, if known 
energy efficiency best practices are implemented, global building energy demand could be 
reduced by one-third by 2050 [20]. 
Residential properties represent around 76% of Bahrain’s housing stock, with commercial 
buildings accounting for around 17%. Total housing demand (Bahraini and non-Bahraini) 
is expected to increase to 263,536 housing units in 2020, and to 346,718 in 2030, from a 
current stock of 145,181 in 2013 [21]. The residential and commercial sectors therefore have 
high potential for significant energy efficiency improvements.sectors in Bahrain; first to significantly reduce the electricity used in buildings, and second, 
to improve the thermal efficiency of buildings. The two are inextricably linked. Inefficient 
appliances and lighting generate heat, and inadequate thermal insulation allows heat from 
outside to enter the building. These three sources of heat place an extra load on the air 
conditioning system, which requires significant electricity during the summer months.
New build, or renovation, creates the opportunity to improve efficiency by building to a 
higher standard, and by introducing more efficient equipment. Alternative modes of cooling 
can also be considered, where technically and economically feasible, such as converting to 
district cooling instead of using standalone air conditioning.
The residential sector used most of the grid electricity, at 49.5% of total grid consumption, 
during the baseline period. The commercial sector was the second-largest user, accounting 
for 36.6% during the same period [8]. 
In recognition of the sectors’ large consumption share, Thermal Insulation regulations were 
introduced in 1999 (Ministerial Order No. 8/1999), which mandated all buildings over four 
stories to be insulated, and stipulated minimum requirements for the efficiency of the 
envelope of residential and commercial buildings. In 2012, the regulations were extended 
to cover all buildings (Ministerial Order No. 63/2012).
Around 60% of the residential sector’s annual electricity use is related to air conditioning, 
which is similar for the commercial sector, at 55% annual electricity use [8]. To improve 
the efficiency of AC units available for retail, the government enacted a Minimum Energy 
Performance Standard (MEPS) and energy efficiency labeling of small AC units (Ministerial 
Order No. 70/2015). 
In regard to lighting, two regulations are in force which effectively ban the use of incandescent 
lamps in Bahrain: Cabinet Order. No. 6-14/2013 was enacted and implemented in 2014 on 
the minimum efficiency of household lamps; and a regulation for nondirectional household 
lamps was enacted (Ministerial Order No. 3/2015) to facilitate the phase out of incandescent 
lamps. Kingdom of Bahrain
tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
Seven initiatives to improve energy efficiency in the residential and commercial sectors are 
summarized in Table 4. Some of these initiatives, such as minimum energy performance 
standards for lighting and small AC, have been already adopted and are in the process of 
implementation. Other initiatives are either in the early stages of development, or will be 
developed.

Expected Contribution to 6% National Target 3,010
The Green Building Initiatives aim to reduce the energy demand of buildings. Many 
countries have revised their building codes to require more efficiency to help to lock in energy 
savings in new buildings and renovations of existing buildings. Bahrain’s Building Energy 
Efficiency Code initiative is an evolution of the existing thermal insulation regulations and 
will include additional requirements for various types of building systems. It will apply to 
new buildings and the renovation of existing buildings. For residential buildings, the Code 
might require increased efficiency of AC systems, lower shading coefficients for windows, 
reflective roofs and more efficient lighting systems. For commercial buildings, the Code 
might require improved building envelopes (including insulation, reflective roofs, window 
to wall limitations) and increased efficiency in HVAC, lighting, and water heating systems 
[8]. The Code will also need to align with the pending GCC building code. The Code will be 
complemented by the Renewable Energy Mandate for New Buildings, which is being 
implemented under the National Renewable Energy Action Plan. The Mandate will require 
renewable energy technologies to be integrated into the design of new buildings. 
Under the Building Energy Labeling initiative an energy performance label for buildings 
will be developed. It will enable prospective tenants and buyers to take energy performance 
into consideration in their rental or purchase decision. International experience demonstrates 
that energy efficient buildings are commanding a premium when being rented or sold, and it 
therefore encourages building owners to implement energy efficiency measures to improve 
their rating. The key components of the initiative will include the development of energy 
audit procedures and tools, professional capacity building to conduct audits, and a national efficient buildings through the adoption of a formal certification scheme. The Ministry of 
Works, Urban Planning and Municipalities has already implemented a set of green building 
criteria for new build and renovations of public buildings (CPD Green Building Design 
Guidelines, see Figure 15). A voluntary certification scheme based on the award of danats 
(a point system based meeting a set criteria) is being considered. In the meantime, real 
estate developers can apply, if they so wish, to international certification bodies such as LEED 
(Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design from the US), BREEAM (Building Research 
Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology from Europe), or EDGE (Excellence

Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) can be a cost-effective option for a country 
to transition toward more energy efficient products, because MEPS encourage manufacturers 
to improve the efficiency of their products and introduce more efficient replacements [22]. 
Labeling initiatives aim to encourage consumers to make a preference towards more 
efficient products, by providing energy consumption information. In Bahrain, the MEPS and 
Labeling for Lighting, Air Conditioning, and Appliances initiatives extends the scope of 
the regulations which have already been implemented, and aims to reduce the electric 
consumption of these products by establishing higher energy efficiency specifications. The 
scope will be extended to household and commercial lamps (including directional lamps, 
fluorescent tubes, LED tubes and ballasts); large AC units; and refrigerators. Freezers and  Kingdom of Bahrain

supplied to multiple buildings through a network of underground pipes. This form of cooling 
is more energy (and water) efficient than other forms of cooling (central air or water-cooled 
chillers)2 and therefore removes the need for additional substations, and frees up roof to 
areas for other uses. Bahrain was the first country in the GCC to adopt district cooling, 
in Awali in 1948. The Kingdom currently has several district cooling networks in various 
locations totaling around 150,000 RT (refrigeration tons), another key differentiator for 
Bahrain. However, several technical and financial barriers exist which means the current 
infrastructure is underutilized, such as market distortions in regard to subsidies, and allocation 
of costs between developers and consumers. The District Cooling initiative seeks to address 
the barriers and introduce a regulatory framework to revitalize and expand the existing 
capacity. Until district cooling regulations are in place, real estate developers must conduct a 
cost benefit analysis demonstrating why they cannot connect to the existing district cooling 
infrastructure.

QR 4OVERVIEW
Bahrain is committed to implementing energy efficiency programs in line with the Economic 
Vision 2030 and the Government Action Plan 2015-2018. The government has already taken 
a number of critical steps to shift Bahrain towards more efficient consumption of energy, and 
can also provide leadership by strongly addressing energy efficiency within the government 
sector, notably in regard to its building stock. 
The purchasing power of government can drive energy efficiency by requiring suppliers to 
provide goods and services with the highest energy efficiency standards. For example, a 
requirement could be included that goods and services are sourced from suppliers with an 
energy management system (EMS), who report energy data and have implemented energy 
efficiency plans, alternatively the supplier should hold an internationally recognized EMS 
certification (such as ISO 50001). The government can also act as a pioneer by piloting new 
technologies to demonstrate their feasibility to the private sector. 
PROPOSED SECTOR INITIATIVES
For the purposes of the national target, the government sector is considered to encompass 
the government, non-commercial state bodies, the defense force, the police, hospitals and 
other health facilities, local municipalities, schools and universities, as well as housing for 
which the Ministry of Housing is responsible. Four initiatives are set out for the government 
sector as summarized in Table 5.

An Energy Management System (EMS) is a methodology and systematic process for 
continually improving energy performance, and maximizing energy savings and productivity 
by achieving the full cost-effective potential offered by energy efficiency. Implementation 
experiences in many European countries, have shown that a fully implemented EMS can 
achieve average annual energy performance improvements of 2-3% [24]. The Government 
Buildings Energy Management initiative will help the various public sector actors to measure 
and understand their energy use, commit to savings, design and implement projects to drive 
a reduction in their energy use (such as retrofitting)and measure and verify the savings Kingdom of Bahrain
tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
phase. In August 2013, Ministerial Order No. 6-14/2013 mandated the replacement of all 
incandescent and halogen lamps in government buildings with energy efficient lamps. The 
Order was circulated by the Cabinet to all government ministries and agencies. The use of 
energy efficient lamps became mandatory effective 13 February 2014. 
In Bahrain, almost 135,000 High Pressure Sodium (HPS) luminaires are used in street 
lighting, ranging from 70W to 1,000W. Street lights consume around 1% of grid electricity 
and the annual cost of street lighting (electricity and maintenance) is around BHD 4.7 
million [25]. Bahrain has the opportunity to significantly improve the efficiency and the 
annual cost of street lighting through the Street Lighting Refurbishment initiative. Options 
include revising Bahrain’s lighting standards; installation of proven, more efficient, and costeffective products, such as LEDs with smart management; and a strategy for the timing and 
scale of lamp replacement. 
The government sector is a major purchaser of goods, works and services in Bahrain, 
with the annual value of public procurement contracts amounting to approximately BHD 
1.3 billion [26]. Due to its size, the government sector has the opportunity to influence 
the supply by directing the demand. The Green Public Procurement initiative aims to 
improve energy efficiency in the government sector through procurement of products and 
equipment with higher energy efficiency performance. Acquiring higher efficiency products 
and services demonstrates the government’s commitment to environmental stewardship 
and sustainability, by becoming a model consumer of green products and services. In turn, 
this can drive higher energy standards in the private sector by following government’s 
leadership when purchasing goods and services.Target Sectors & Key Stakeholders

Adopting energy efficiency as a core business element has multiple benefits for the industry 
sector, it improves productivity and profitability; increases competitiveness; and helps to 
reduce the impact of industrial activities on the environment to meet national, regional and 
international obligations. Energy costs have increased for the sector in Bahrain following 
the gas and transport fuel price increases that were recently implemented, and the revised 
EWA tariffs. In addition, export-oriented, energy intensive companies with products that are 
subject to international pricing, have experienced major declines (around 40% since 2010) 
in the price of commodities [27]. Given this combination of factors, companies have been 
pursuing energy efficiency initiatives to reduce energy consumption, and as a result maintain 
and in many cases, decrease operating costs. 
The industry sector contributes over 40% to GDP, and in 2014 employed over 16% of the 
workforce [28]. Given the presence of energy intensive industries, sector is the largest 
consumer of energy in Bahrain. During the baseline period (2009-2013) the industry sector 
consumed on average 16,156 GWh of final energy per annum, accounting for 21% of natural 
gas consumption, and 41% of total final energy use [1]. Even though many industries have 
captive power plants, the sector’s share of grid electricity was 13.6% for the baseline period 
[9]. Five major energy users dominate the sector, namely: ALBA (aluminum smelting) GPIC 
(chemicals), BAPCO (refining), Tatweer (oil and gas), and Bahrain Steel. The two major 
sectoral challenges are addressing rising energy prices, and continuing to drive incremental 
reductions in energy intensity.
PROPOSED SECTOR INITIATIVES
The Industry Program initiative has a three-fold purpose: to coordinate the energy efficiency 
activities of the major industry players and large energy consumers; to share best practice 
between the companies through workshops and other knowledge-sharing activities; and to 
facilitate the collection of energy saving data between the companies and SEU, in order to 
demonstrate that each party is making progress towards meeting its target.
The initiative has two parts. Major industry companies and large energy consumers will 
sign a compact with the Minister of Electricity and Water Affairs, whereby they commit to 
meeting energy savings of 1% every two years to reach an overall target of 4% of baseline 
consumption in 2025 (as shown in Table 6); and a network will be introduced to help 
coordinate and share best practice between the members. Kingdom of Bahrain

The companies that make up Bahrain’s industry sector are heterogeneous, and as such 
the manner in which they deliver savings under the Industry Program initiative will differ. 
In some cases, the energy savings contributed by an energy efficiency project will count 
directly to the target; in other cases, a reduction in a company’s energy intensity arising 
from a plant expansion (where the production rises at a rate faster than the plant’s energy 
consumption) can be converted into a savings figure. The reduction in a company’s primary 
energy consumption arising from the installation of solar PV (for example), will also be 
counted, as each kWh of PV produced decreases the demand for grid electricity and thereby 
reduces primary energy consumed.
The industry sector will be encouraged to implement and achieve ISO 50001 certification, 
which is the Energy Management Standard, released in June 2011. ISO 50001 provides a 
robust framework for optimizing energy efficiency in public and private sector organizations. 
Certification to this standard recognizes an organization’s efforts of continual improvement 
in energy management. Furthermore, the implementation of ISO 50001 will enable 
organizations to lead by example within their respective industries.
The commitment by industry to deliver an additional 1% energy reduction each year is 
substantial and, because the sector accounts for such a large percentage of Bahrain’s energy 
use, the sector’s contribution to the national energy efficiency target is significant.Target Sectors & Key Stakeholders

OVERVIEW
The natural gas used in making electricity accounts for almost half of Bahrain’s total primary 
energy supply [1], therefore the efficiency of supply (the production, transmission and 
distribution of electricity) is as important as demand side energy efficiency initiatives. 
Electricity supply consumed an average of 91,700 GWh of primary energy per annum during 
the 2009 – 2013 baseline period. In the 20 years from 1993 to 2013, the consumption of 
natural gas for electricity production, transmission and distribution grew from 44,159 GWh to 
97,448, an increase of 120% or 4.0% per annum (compared to GDP growth of 4.8%). During 
the same period, total electricity consumed rose by 3.9% per annum, from 11,339 GWh to 
24,516 GWh [9].
The ratio of natural gas used to electricity produced is calculated to be 3.5 during the 
2009 – 2013 baseline period, higher than the GCC average of 3, and takes into account 
the energy used in the co-production of desalinated water [1]. This is partly structural (the 
type and efficiency of the power plants in Bahrain’s energy system) and partly operational 
(for example, the level of ‘spinning reserve’ provided to ensure the reliable operation of 
the system). In any case, it points to a significant opportunity to deliver energy savings by 
optimizing the ratio between natural gas in and electricity out. 
PROPOSED SECTOR INITIATIVES
Four initiatives to improve efficiency in electricity supply are summarized in Table 7. All of 
these initiatives are led by the Electricity and Water Authority, and are in the implementation 
phase.

Current CCGT (combined cycle gas turbine) electrical efficiencies range from 45% - 60%. The 
commissioning of CCGTs during the period 2003-2013 has raised the average efficiency of 
electricity generation in Bahrain, from 28% to around 44% [29]. in the efficiency by which natural gas is converted into electricity. International programs 
typically include the following elements: 
• Reducing the reliance on the least efficient power plants, some of which are 
operated primarily to desalinate water;
• Utilizing aggregated demand reduction/response as an alternative to new 
capacity;
• Utilizing demand side frequency response as an alternative to spinning 
reserve;
• The use of real-time tariffs to better utilize the existing capacity; and
• A benchmarking exercise to compare the level of spinning reserve against the 
best-in-class.
Bahrain has a relatively efficient transmission and distribution system, with losses of 9.8% 
[9] compared to a GCC average of 9.2% over the baseline period [1]. The Electricity T&D 
Efficiency Program initiative aims to improve the efficiency of the system. Similar programs 
internationally typically include the following elements: conducting a dynamic line rating 
trial; undertaking a feasibility study into the use of capacity banks and battery storage in 
managing the system; or conductor, transformer and cable upgrading.
Electricity can be divided into three types:
• Working power, KW (actual, real or active power);
• Reactive power, KVAR (the power that magnetic equipment need to produce 
the magnetizing flux); and
• Apparent power, KVA (the vector summation of KW and KVAR).  Kingdom of Bahrain
tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
result in overheating of equipment (conductors and devices); low efficiency of connected 
devices; high voltage drops in alternators and transformers in the supply network; and overall 
higher electricity consumption. The Power Factor Correction Program initiative aims to 
improve the power factor to be 0.9 or greater. In February 2011, Ministerial Order No 4/2011 
was issued requiring the overall power factor for customer electrical installations to not be 
less than 0.9, otherwise the excess reactive power consumption will be calculated based on 
power factor value of 0.9. The order has been implemented for commercial, government 
and industry sectors. If the power factor is less than 0.9, then the excess reactive power 
consumed is charged at 0.016 BHD KVARh. The charges are included in the monthly customer 
bill.
There are multiple benefits to a smart metering program: more accurate meter reading, 
more efficient billing and ability to manage debtors; and better ability to manage daytime 
consumption peaks and electricity consumption through the use of real-time pricing. In 
addition, a more detailed understanding of consumer usage patterns is possible. Bahrain has 
360,000 meters fitted in the network [9]. The Smart Metering Program initiative will initially 
target the implementation of smart meters for high consumers and new developments, 
before the implementation is rolled out to all consumers. Target Sectors & Key Stakeholders

The transport sector consumed an average of 12,253 GWh per annum of final energy during 
the 2009 – 2013 baseline period, accounting for 31% of total final energy use. In the 20 
years from 1993 to 2013, the transport sector’s final energy use grew from 394 ktoe to 1,113 
ktoe, an increase of 182% or 5.3% per annum, faster than GDP growth of 4.8% [1].
Energy use in transport depends on three elements, ranging from long-term to short-term: 
(1) the mode of travel (for example, rail versus road); (2) the technology (for example, a fuel 
efficient or electric car versus an inefficient light truck); and (3) driver behavior and choices. 
The initiatives underway and proposed address all three aspects. A train line to Saudi Arabia 
is in planning; the government recently invested in a new bus fleet and extended the 
network to cover a greater percentage of the population; and the 2016 changes to the fuel 
price will have both a short-term impact on fuel consumption and will drive alternative 
vehicle choices in the medium to long term.
Bahrain has in the last two years invested significantly in its public transport network. The 
bus network has been extended and upgraded, with new, fuel efficient, wifi-enabled and 
affordable buses servicing a wider percentage of Bahrain and with increased frequency. The 
Ministry of Transport is promoting the use of public transport, which currently accounts for 
less than 1% of all journeys. The number of buses has expanded from 35 to 140, coverage 
has risen from 25% to 77% and the number of routes from 13 to 32. Daily use has risen 
from 16,000 journeys per day in 2015, to 28,000 journeys per day by the start of 2016 [30].
The continued improvement of the public bus service is a key national project. Additional 
elements in the development of a more comprehensive transport network will focus on the 
development of a more holistic approach, incorporating taxi terminals, and park and ride 
facilities. Plans are being progressed to develop a light rail network, and Bahrain is working 
with its GCC neighbors on the development of a diesel-powered GCC rail link which will help 
reduce the energy intensity of goods transported within the GCC.  Kingdom of Bahrain
tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
It is a government policy to diversify the modal and fuel mix of the transport sector, as well 
as to maximize the efficient use of energy. Planned initiatives seek to decouple energy use 
from growth in activity and demand in the sector.

In the medium to long term, higher fuel prices encourages road users to purchase more 
efficient vehicles. The Transport Subsidy Reform initiative is in the implementation phase. 
In January 2016, Bahrain made significant modifications to the pricing of transport fuel which 
had remained unchanged for 33 years. The price was increased by up to 60%, with the price 
of 95 Octane (Mumtaz) increasing from 100 fils to 160 fils (USD 0.42) per litre, and the price 
of 91 octane (Jayyid) increasing from 80 fils to 125 fils (USD 0.33) per litre [30]. This initiative 
targets a transport fuel reduction of 4% (as a percentage of the baseline). 
The Vehicle Efficiency Standards & Labeling initiative will introduce minimum energy 
performance standards and labeling for all vehicles to transform the market towards vehicles 
with higher fuel efficiencies. The initiative consists of four parts: setting the minimum 
standards; confirming the vehicle performance at the point of importation; working with 
dealers to ensure that the labels are appropriately displayed; and increasing consumer 
awareness by providing information.
The policy objectives in relation to transport encompass maximizing the efficiency of 
the transport network, reducing transport emissions, and improving the accessibility and 
affordability of transport. Energy demand reduction is a major driver, and for this reason, all 
savings realized under initiatives such as subsidy reform and new modes of transport (for 
example, light rail) will be included in the assessment of progress in achieving the national 
energy efficiency target.Target Sectors & Key Stakeholders

The challenges faced in delivering energy efficiency are common to multiple sectors of the 
economy such as lack of awareness, competing priorities, hidden costs, financial barriers, 
and access to timely and accurate information. 
In order for Bahrain to meet its national target, the background conditions must be correct. 
Policies, institutional support, and market conditions can support energy efficiency initiatives 
by making sure the information is available and ensuring that signals and incentives are in 
place to reward the right choice. These enabling conditions are created by measures and 
policies that cut across all sectors of the economy.
PROPOSED INITIATIVES
Four initiatives are considered cross-sectoral as they relate to more than one sector as

The Electricity Subsidy Reform initiative is in the implementation phase. In March 2016, 
Bahrain made significant modifications to the pricing of electricity and a new tariff schedule 
was published. After taking expected inflation into account, and in the absence of any other 
measures to reduce electricity use, the initiative could result in a 14% reduction in use 
compared to the 2009 – 2013 baseline. 
A public program to raise awareness and disseminate information on energy efficiency 
complements the other initiatives proposed by increasing relevant knowledge and support 
amongst all stakeholders, including households and businesses. Information about the 
financial, environmental, and social benefits of energy efficiency can be communicated in 
various ways, such as via social media, mass media campaigns, pamphlets and stickers, 
and in-person interactions (including seminars, workshops, and presentations). The 
Awareness Raising initiative will focus on energy use, habits, and behaviors, and target 
energy-consuming equipment and appliances. Any efforts will not replace communication 
campaigns already under way, but instead complement them.  Kingdom of Bahrain
tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
to enable a workforce to develop and implement energy efficiency initiatives, and perform 
monitoring and impact evaluations. In particular, the initiative aims to establish energy 
efficiency training, accreditation and certification scheme for energy auditors, energy 
managers and energy service providers. It is proposed that this initiative will be delivered in 
conjunction with Tamkeen to maximize employment opportunities for Bahrainis. 
The Institutional Infrastructure initiative will build and enhance the institutional capabilities 
necessary for the successful achievement of Bahrain’s national energy efficiency target. 
Responsibility for the implementation of the initiatives is divided between multiple ministries, 
given their respective focus areas, and reflects how the NEEAP requires concerted action 
from all stakeholders. This diversified responsibility could create challenges for accountability, 
coordination, funding, and delivery of the expected energy savings. To this end, SEU is the 
designated agency to lead the coordination of the NEEAP, and as such needs to be properly 
resourced, in terms of staffing to implement the initiatives under its responsibility; to support 
the implementation of the other initiatives; and to measure and verify the associated savings. 
In addition to the specific initiatives functions, SEU requires the following capacity:
• Strategy, action plan and policy development;
• Initiative design and evaluation, including technical know-how;
• Implementation support, including coordination of stakeholder engagement;
• Research and analysis, including cost-benefit analysis and financial modelling;
• Statistics function, including energy savings measurement, monitoring and verification, 
to report on progress compared to the baseline;
• Capacity building and training activities support for stakeholders.
Along with SEU functions and capabilities, the following will facilitate the achievement of the 
national energy efficiency target:
• Adoption and oversight of the specific initiatives within respective government 
organizations, including dedicated staffing and budget allocations for energy efficiency.
• Relationships with end users (for example, through billing); and fostering publicprivate partnerships for awareness raising and collaboration;financial mechanism) through a central fund or dedicated instruments (for example, a 
pay-as-you-save credit facility; or green sukuk) to encourage take up of energy efficient 
products and services,
• Timely official data on energy supply and consumption, as well as forecast demand, 
including peak demand. The data resource should also include a dataset of key statistics 
such as population; GDP; building stock; vehicle stock; and include an energy balance. 
Energy efficiency resources including staffing and funding should also be reported on 
and captured as part of national data.
• An evaluation culture whereby impact, process, market and cost evaluation is 
embedded in the implementation and oversight of each initiative. Kingdom of Bahrain

tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
A number of factors must come together to ensure that the National Energy Efficiency 
Action Plan effectively transitions from a desk document, to actions that capitalize on the 
potential benefits described: 
- A governance structure that provides guidance and executive sponsorship; 
- Incorporation of energy efficiency initiatives in ministries’ action plans and work 
programs; 
- Tools enabling deployment of energy efficiency initiatives; 
- Funding for projects and activities. 
5.1 IMPLEMENTATION
There are 22 initiatives defined under this Action Plan, with multiple parties involved in 
implementing the initiatives. Many are currently being implemented; others still need to be 
designed, resourced and implemented by the relevant parties. Other actions will be added 
over the course of the plan and will contribute to the achievement of the target. 
The following entities will be directly engaged in the implementation of the initiatives:
- Electricity and Water Authority 
- Ministry of Works, Municipalities and Urban Planning 
- Ministry of Industry and Commerce 
- Ministry of Housing
- Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunication
- Directorate of Traffic Services
- Large industrial companies such as ALBA, BAPCO, Tatweer, GPIC, Foulath Holding.
Careful coordination and open, transparent collaboration between all relevant stakeholders 
will be required to deliver the savings set out in this action plan, and to enable the measures 
and savings to be adequately monitored and evaluated.SEU is the designated agency for promoting sustainable energy policies and practices in the 
Kingdom of Bahrain. As such, SEU will lead the coordination efforts in implementing the 
NEEAP, and will provide technical assistance in the design and implementation of specific 
initiatives.
Responsibilities:
- Coordinate implementation activities among all stakeholders through developing 
partnerships and organizing regular coordination meetings.
- Inform stakeholders on the progress of implementation of the NEEAP.
- Draft energy efficiency policies and regulations and standard operating procedures 
for their implementation.
- Conduct monitoring and evaluation of initiatives, and calculate energy and monetary 
savings.
- Carry out feasibility studies, cost-benefit analysis of various technology options and 
business models, as well as overseeing the implementation of pilot projects.
- Provide technical assistance in developing tendering documents, drafting requests 
for proposals, and assessing outcomes of pilot projects.
- Carry out information dissemination and awareness raising campaigns through 
launching a dedicated website, organizing press conferences, promoting energy 
efficiency at various public events.
- Organize and support capacity building and training activities for government and 
non-government stakeholders.
5.3 OVERSIGHT 
The NEEAP Implementation Follow Up Committee will be established to oversee the 
implementation process. This Committee will be composed of high-level representatives 
of key government and non-government institutions who would play the role of change 
agents to provide guidance, support and oversight. The Committee will be chaired by the 
Minister of Electricity and Water Affairs, and may include representatives from the Electricity 
and Water Authority, the Ministry of Finance, the Office of the First Deputy Prime Minister, 
the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry of Works, Urban 
Planning and Municipalities, the Ministry of Oil, and the Supreme Council for Environment. 
The Committee will meet on a quarterly basis. Kingdom of Bahrain
tional Energy Efficiency Action Plan
- Oversee implementation of the NEEAP and facilitate its execution;
- Identify action items to overcome implementation issues and challenges;
- Put recommendations and suggest actions to relevant ministries;
- Decide on making changes in the NEEAP if required;
- Discuss the progress in the implementation process.
SEU will assist in preparing the agenda of the meeting, the minutes, including the action list; 
the progress report on the status of the implementation process since the last meeting; and 
any other documents to be discussed or considered during the meeting.
5.4 MONITORING AND EVALUATION
METHODS FOR CALCULATING ENERGY SAVINGS
The EU’s Energy Efficiency Directive sets out four methods for calculating savings: deemed 
savings; metered savings; scaled savings; and surveyed savings [31]. It is anticipated that all 
methods will be utilized under the NEEAP:
Deemed Savings: savings made by reference to the results of previous independently 
monitored energy improvements in similar installations (ex-ante), for example, the street 
lighting refurbishment.
Metered Savings: the savings from the installation of a measure, or package of measures, 
is determined by recording the actual reduction in energy use, taking due account of factors 
such as additionality, occupancy, production levels and the weather which may affect 
consumption (ex-post). An example could be the savings arising from the energy upgrade 
of a government building.be used where establishing robust measured data for a specific installation is difficult or 
disproportionately expensive, for example, replacing a compressor or electric motor with 
a different kWh rating than that for which independent information on savings has been 
measured. This could be an industrial savings project whereby the new energy reduction 
equipment is different in scale to the equipment for which well referenced savings are 
available.
Surveyed Savings: where consumers’ response to advice, information campaigns, labeling 
or certification schemes, or smart metering is determined. This approach may only be used 
for savings resulting from changes in consumer behavior. It may not be used for savings 
resulting from the installation of physical measures.
PROGRAM AND MEASURE EVALUATION
Separately from the identification of savings, it will be necessary to evaluate each initiative 
to determine if it has cost effectively achieved its objectives. A less formal evaluation will 
be conducted after an initiative is in the implementation phase, to confirm that the initiative 
is on track to yield the expected results. In this way, deficiencies can be detected early and 
corrected to streamline delivery and maximize effectiveness. Kingdom of Bahrain
