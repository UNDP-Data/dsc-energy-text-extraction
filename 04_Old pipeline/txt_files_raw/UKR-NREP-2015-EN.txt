l Ukraine has made important progress in recent years in planning the future of its energy system and 
developing a renewable-energy policy. By the year 2030, the increased use of renewable energy will 
reduce Ukraine’s overall energy system costs.
l If current policies (known as the Reference Case in this study), which are described in the recently approved National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) are maintained, the share of renewable energy 
in the total final energy consumption (TFEC) will increase from 3% in 2009 (the plan’s base year) to 13.2% 
by 2030. That total could be boosted to 21.8% using options identified in this study.
l Increasing the renewable-energy share from 13.2% under the Reference Case to 21.8% in REmap 2030 
would result in savings of USD 175 million per year in 2030, and when accounting for benefits resulting 
from reduced health effects and CO2 emissions savings would increase to USD 1.3 billion per year based 
on conservative estimates, and yield USD 5.5 billion in savings in 2030 based on more aggressive estimates.
l Ukraine has the potential to increase renewable energy use by ten-fold from 87 petajoules (PJ) in 2009, 
to 870 PJ of total final renewable energy in REmap 2030.
l 73% of renewable energy potential in 2030 is accounted for by heat, 20% for electricity generation and 
7% for transport.
l Nearly 80% of total final renewable energy potential is accounted for by biomass technologies, including 
for heating buildings and industrial plants (including district heating), power generation and as transport 
fuels.
l Through its REmap analysis IRENA has identified an additional potential of 26.9 terawatt hours (TWh) 
of wind energy, 6.2 TWh of biomass and 5.8 TWh of solar photovoltaic (PV) that would boost the share 
of renewables in the electricity sector from 11.3% under the Reference Case to 25% in REmap 2030, a 
four-fold increase of the share over 2009 levels.
l If IRENA’s REmap Options are used, there would be a significant increase in biomass use by 2030 for 
various transport and heating applications (industry, buildings, and district heat) compared with expectations under current policies. The total demand for primary biomass would increase to 820 PJ per year.
l REmap Options that are cost-competitive would boost the share of renewables from 11.8% under current 
policy to 19.0% by 2030. To attain 21.8%, it would require renewables options with incrementally higher 
costs. However, these options also offer non-monetary benefits, such as improving Ukraine’s energy security by reducing its dependence on imported natural gas, and reducing its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.Increasing the renewable energy share to 21.8% would require total investment flows for renewables 
of USD 5.0 billion per year up to 2030, a doubling from current policy plans.
l The REmap Options would allow Ukraine to cut natural gas demand by 15% by 2030 compared to the 
Reference Case – a stabilization of demand at current levels. As this report shows there is room to optimize renewable deployment for combating climate change and supply security.
l While renewables play a critical role in realising Ukraine’s strategic energy goals, potentials for improving 
energy efficiency needs to be considered as well, in particular given the objective to reduce natural gas 
consumption.
l There are barriers to realising the higher renewable energy shares identified in this report. High capital 
costs create uncertainty for investing in renewable energy. This coupled with a changing renewable 
energy policy landscape, also reinforces this lack of confidence for investors. Therefore predictable and 
stable policies should be maintained over long periods to allow for the continuity of investments into 
renewable energy technologies.Ukraine has a significant renewable energy potential 
that can be deployed to enhance the trade balance, create jobs and drive economic activity during a time when 
the country is facing important economic challenges 
such as the increased dependence in energy imports 
and an urgent need to rejuvenate the ageing energy 
capital stock. Deployment of which would importantly 
also help towards existing policy goals of reducing the 
dependency on imported natural gas and help towards 
diversifying the energy supply. An energy supply that is 
also more secure.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)’s 
REmap programme is a series of renewable-energy 
roadmaps for individual countries that shows how they 
boost their use of renewables and in doing so help to 
double the share of these technologies in the global 
energy mix by 2030. The findings suggest that all countries, including Ukraine, have the potential to raise their 
renewable energy share while reaping significant socioeconomic and environmental benefits (IRENA, 2014a).
REmap 2030 is the result of a collaborative process 
between IRENA and country experts. This short report provides detailed background data and results of 
REmap’s Ukraine country analysis, and suggests how 
renewables potential could be maximised. This working paper uses the Ukrainian government’s National 
Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) as a baseline 
of renewables to 2020 and 2030, and extrapolates 
projected gross final energy consumption (GFEC) of 
2020 to 20301. The paper then moves on to discuss 
1 Instead of GFEC, the rest of this paper uses total final energy 
consumption (TFEC) as the main indicator. TFEC includes the 
consumption of industry (including blast furnaces and coke ovens, 
but excluding petroleum refineries and non-energy use), buildings 
(residential and commercial) and transport sectors.
the realistic potential of renewables in 2030 (so-called 
REmap Options) beyond this baseline. REmap Options 
are based on the trends seen in the data provided 
by Ukraine’s government, along with literature review.
Costs and benefits of renewables for the Ukrainian energy system are considered in the context of Ukraine’s 
various policy goals.
Addressing Ukraine’s energy challenge will require comprehensive actions, in particular to ensure environmentally-sustainable practices. The most likely renewable-energy sources for the country are wind, solar, 
geothermal energy, biomass and small hydro power 
(SHP). The right mix of these options can help to reduce 
a large share of Ukraine’s total natural gas demand for 
power generation. For heating, biogas can be used as 
well.
This report starts with a brief description of the REmap 
2030 methodology (Section 2) and then explains the 
present energy situation and recent trends for renewable energy use (Section 3). Section 4 provides the findings of Ukraine’s Reference Case. Section 5 discusses 
the current policy framework, and Section 6 the renewables potential. In Section 7 the potential of REmap 
Options are quantified. The report ends with a discussion of the barriers to scaling up renewable energy in 
Ukraine and suggestions to overcome them (Section 8).
This paper is meant to stimulate discussion in Ukraine 
on increasing the use of renewable options in its energy 
mix. These findings are expected to change over time 
as new developments and fresh data become available.
1. INTRODUCTIONThis section explains the REmap 2030 methodology 
and summarises details about the background data 
used for the Ukraine analysis. Annexes A and B provide 
background data in greater detail.
REmap is an analytical approach for assessing the gap 
between current national renewable energy plans, additional renewable technology options potentially available in 2030 and the SE4All objective of doubling the 
share of global renewable energy share by 2030.
As of June 2014, REmap 2030 had assessed 26 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Ecuador, 
France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Tonga, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Arab 
Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States.
The analysis starts with national-level data covering 
both end users of energy (buildings, industry and transport) and the electricity and district-heat sectors. Current national plans using 2010 as the base year of 
this analysis are the starting point. To the extent data 
availability allows, information for more recent years 
(e.g., 2012, 2013) were provided where relevant. In each 
report, a Reference Case features policies in place or 
under consideration, including energy-efficiency improvements. Reference Case includes TFEC for each 
end-use sector and the total generation of power and 
district-heat sectors, with breakdowns by energy carrier 
for the period from 2010 to 2030. The energy balances 
for the base year of the analysis, 2009, are based on 
the data provided by the International Energy Agency 
(IEA, 2014a). Where relevant, the data are updated with 
the national energy statistics provided by the SSSU, the 
State Statistics Service of Ukraine (http://www.ukrstat.
gov.ua/)2. The Reference Case for Ukraine was based on 
the NREAP and other data provided by the Ukrainian 
2 The comparison of IEA Energy Balances (IEA, 2014a) with the 
Energy Balance of Ukraine according to the SSSU for the year 
2010 yields less than 5% difference in the total energy supply/consumption. The only exception is the transport sector where total 
demand according to the IEA is 8% higher than the data reported 
by the SSSU. This is explained by the difference in road transportation items of 13%. With the exception of the transport sector, where 
data is based on SSSU, the analysis uses IEA data for other sectors.
government. That NREAP was adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers on 1 October 2014 (CoM, 2014), and it 
includes Ukraine’s gross final energy consumption developments to 2020. For 2030, renewable energy use in 
the Reference Case is based on other data provided by 
the Ukrainian government. Gross final energy consumption in 2030 is extrapolation of trends between 2009 
and 2020 according to the NREAP.
Once the Reference Case was prepared additional technology options were identified, labelled in the report 
as REmap Options. The choice of options instead of a 
scenarios-based approach is deliberate: REmap 2030 
is an exploratory study and not a target-setting exercise. While the Reference Case is based on the NREAP, 
the REmap Options for Ukraine came from a variety of 
sources. These include literature review and the longerterm trends to 2035, according to the data provided by 
Ukraine’s government. IRENA developed a REmap tool 
that allows staff and external experts to input data in 
an energy balance for 2010, 2020 and 2030, and then 
assess technology options that could be deployed by 
2030 in an accelerated deployment of renewable energy.
In addition to what is being provided in the annexes of 
this report a detailed list of these technologies and the 
related background data are provided online. The tool includes the cost (capital, operation and maintenance) and 
technical performance (reference capacity of installation, capacity factor and conversion efficiency) of renewable and conventional (fossil fuel, nuclear and traditional 
use of biomass) technologies for each sector analysed: 
industry, buildings, transport, power, and district heat.
Each renewable energy technology is characterised 
by its costs, and the cost of each REmap option is 
represented by its substitution cost. Substitution costs 
are the difference between the annualised cost of the 
REmap Option and a conventional technology used to 
produce the same amount of energy, divided by the 
total renewable energy use in final energy terms (in 
2010 real US Dollar (USD) per gigajoule (GJ)3 of final re3 1 gigajoule (GJ) = 0.0238 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) = 0.238 gigacalories (Gcal) = 278 kilowatt-hour (kWh). 1 USD was on average 
equivalent to 7.9 Ukranian Hryvinia in 2010.
2. METHODOLOGYnewable energy). This indicator provides a comparable 
metric for all renewable energy technologies identified 
in each sector. Substitution costs are the key indicators 
for assessing the economic viability of REmap Options.
They depend on the type of conventional technology 
substituted, energy prices and the characteristics of 
the REmap option. The cost can be positive (incremental) or negative (savings), as many renewable-energy 
technologies are already or could be cost effective 
compared to conventional technologies by 2030 as a 
result of technological learning and economies of scale.
Based on the substitution cost and the potential of each 
REmap Option, country cost-supply curves were developed from two perspectives for the year 2030: government and business. For the government perspective, 
costs estimates are as government would have done 
them, excluding energy taxes and subsidies. The choice 
of analysis from a government perspective is to ensure 
a comparison of the cost and benefits across all REmap 
countries. For the business perspective, the process was 
repeated to include national prices, including energy 
taxes and subsidies. This approach shows the cost of the 
transition as businesses and investors would calculate it.
For both government and business perspectives a 10% 
cost of capital was assumed. By estimating the costs 
from two perspectives, the analysis shows the effect of 
accounting for energy taxes and subsidies whereas all 
other parameters were kept same. Assessment of all additional costs related to complementary infrastructure, 
such as transmission lines, reserve power needs, energy 
storage or fuel stations, are excluded from this study.
Throughout this study the renewable-energy share is 
estimated related to TFEC. Based on TFEC the renewable energy share can be estimated for the total of all 
end-use sectors of Ukraine or for each of them (industry, 
transport, residential and commercial, and agriculture 
sectors), with and without the contribution of renewable electricity and district heat. The share of renewable 
power and district heat generation is also calculated.
Estimating the renewable energy share based on TFEC 
is different than estimating it based on gross final 
energy consumption (GFEC), which is the metric applied in Ukraine’s NREAP as defined by the European 
Community (2009). There are two major differences in 
estimating the renewable energy share based on TFEC 
and GFEC: 1) according to GFEC, total renewable energy 
use includes the quantities of renewable power and district heat consumed by the power and heat generation 
plants as well as the losses in their distribution, whereas 
TFEC looks at consumption only, and 2) renewable 
electricity consumed in the transport sector is added as 
renewable energy use on top of renewable power generation in GFEC whereas in TFEC it is already accounted 
for under the total renewable power consumption.
This report also discusses the finance needs and avoided externalities related to increased renewable energy 
deployment. Three finance indicators are developed, 
namely net incremental system costs, net incremental 
investment needs and subsidy needs. These indicators 
are briefly defined as:
1) Net incremental system costs: This is the sum of 
the differences between the total capital (in USD/
yr) and operating expenditures (in USD/yr) of all 
energy technologies based on their deployment 
in REmap 2030 and the Reference Case in the 
period 2010-2030 for each year.
2) Net incremental investment needs: This is the 
difference between the annual investment needs 
of all REmap Options and the investment needs 
of the substituted conventional technologies 
which would otherwise be invested in. Investment needs for renewable energy capacity are 
estimated for each technology by multiplying its 
total deployment (in gigawatt (GW)) to deliver 
the same energy service as conventional capacity and the investment costs (in USD per kilowatt 
(kW)) for the period 2010-2030. This total is then 
annualised by dividing the number of years covered in the analysis.
3) Subsidy needs: Total subsidy requirements for 
renewables are estimated as the difference in the 
delivered energy service costs for the REmap 
Option (in USD/GJ final energy) relative to its 
conventional counterpart multiplied by its deployment in a given year (in petajoules (PJ) per 
year).
External effects related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions as well as improvements in outdoor and 
indoor air pollution from the decreased use of fossil 
fuels have been estimated.
As a first step, for each sector and energy carrier, GHG 
emissions from fossil fuel combustion are estimated.
For this purpose, the energy content of each type of sulphur dioxide (SO2), mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 
particulate matter of less than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) 
from fossil fuel-based power plant operation, and 2) 
outdoor emissions of NOx, and PM2.5 from road vehicles.
To evaluate the external costs related to outdoor emission of SO2, NOx and PM2.5 from fossil power plant operation, the following parameters for respective pollutants 
were used: (a) emission factor (i.e., tonne per kWh for 
2010 and 2030 taken from the IIASA GAINS database 
(ECRIPSE scenario (IIASA, 2014), and (b) unit external 
costs (i.e., Euro-per-tonne average for the European 
Union (EU), adapted for the US from the EU CAFE 
project (AEA, 2005). Potential differences in external effects between the EU and Ukraine values are accounted 
for based on the difference in gross domestic product 
(GDP) values.
Further details of the REmap 2030 methodology can 
be found online in IRENA’s REmap webpage at: www.
irena.org/remap
fossil fuel was multiplied by its default emission factors 
(based on lower heating values, LHV) as provided by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Eggleston 
et al., 2006). Emissions were estimated separately for 
the Reference Case and REmap 2030. The difference 
between the two estimates yields the total net GHG 
emission reduction from fossil fuel combustion due to 
increased renewable energy use. To evaluate the related external costs related to carbon emissions, a carbon 
price range of USD 20-80 per tonne CO2 is assumed 
(IPCC, 2007). This range was applied only to CO2 emissions, but not other greenhouse gases. According to 
the IPCC (2007), carbon price should reflect the social 
cost of mitigating one tonne of CO2 equivalent GHG 
emissions.
The external costs related to human health are estimated in a separate step, which excludes any effect 
related to GHG emissions. Outdoor air pollution is evaluated from the following sources: 1) outdoor emission of 3. PRESENT ENERGY SITUATION AND 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE 
RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR
Ukraine’s TFEC reached 3 exajoules (EJ) in 20094.
Industry accounted for the largest share of Ukraine’s 
TFEC, at 29% in 2009 (SSSU). Buildings, transport, district heating and electricity were the other sectors with 
a share of at least 15% (Figure 1). Natural gas accounted 
for 1.7 EJ, or 36% of Ukraine’s total energy supply. Coal 
and oil products accounted for 31% and 12% of the total 
in 2009, respectively. Nuclear accounted for 19%. The 
remaining 2% was related to the use of renewables.
Ukraine has limited fossil-fuel energy reserves. Domestic production of oil, gas and coal is too small to meet 
demand, so the country is reliant on imports of each.
Imported gas accounted for 65% to 70% of its total 
consumption in 2010 and is the chief contributor to the 
country’s energy-security problem. Additionally, the 
growing coal deficit is impacting the power generation 
sector. Although importing fossil fuel energy can help 
close the deficit, there are financial implications. Also, 
the existing seaport capacity covers only forty percent 
of the total coal volume that would need to be imported 
(EDM, 2014).
The energy intensity of Ukraine’s domestic economy is 
three to four times higher than that of more-developed 
countries. Until 2006 Ukraine imported natural gas at 
prices well below international levels, however, since 
then the price from Ukraine’s main supplier, Russia, 
has increased sharply. The price per 1,000 cubic meters (m3)5 rose from USD 95 in 2006 (USD 2.9 per GJ) 
to USD 229 (USD 7.1 per GJ) in 2009, and surpassed 
USD  400 (USD 12.4 per GJ) toward the end of 2012 
(IEA, 2012b). According to the gas deal between Ukraine 
and Russia in October 2014, the price of natural gas in 
4 1 EJ = 1,000 PJ = 1018 J. 1 megatonne of oil equivalent (mtoe) = 
1,000 kilotonne of oil equivalent (ktoe) = 41.87 PJ. TFEC includes 
total combustible and non-combustible energy use from all energy 
carriers as fuel (for the transport sector) and to generate heat (for 
industry and building sectors) as well as electricity and direct heat.
It excludes non-energy use.
5 1 m3 of natural gas in Ukraine has a gross calorific value between 
34 505 MJ and 36 401 MJ. A ratio of 1.1:1 is assumed between gross 
and net calorific value of natural gas (ECRB, 2014).
the last quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015 was 
USD 378 and USD 365, respectively. This deal is effective until April 2015. After April 2015, the price of natural 
gas for households will increase three folds reaching 
the level industry sectors pay (UAH 7,188 or USD 310 per 
1,000 m3). The price of natural gas for district heat companies will grow by 29% to UAH 2994 or USD 130 per 
1,000 m3. The district heating tariffs will increase by 67% 
and electricity tariffs by 19% and as a result of the tariff 
increases, it is expected that up to 13 million households 
will be eligible for targeted social assistance related to 
municipal services (compared to 1.1 million in 2014)6.
According to the new International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) schedule, if Ukraine undertakes the scenarios on 
phasing out of subsidies, new household tariffs would 
be equal to the true cost of natural gas import price by 
2017, compared to a 56% share in 2014. The natural gas 
price stabilizes at around USD 345 per 1,000 m3 by 2015 
and stabilizes at this level to 2030 (G7, 2015).
Imported natural gas volume has decreased in recent 
years as a result: in October 2014, the volume of natural 
gas stored in Ukraine was 16 billion m3, some 5 billion m3
below peak winter demand (Financial Times, 2014). Gas 
demand is seasonal with a clear winter peak for heating.
Overall, these imports results in huge costs for Ukraine 
because gas is procured during the low demand season 
(and injected to storages between April and October) to 
be used in the high demand season. Storage is key for 
the supply security of gas and currently, Ukraine has a 
total gas storage capacity of 32 billion cubic meters with 
five storage facilities in the western part of the country 
accounting for more than 80% of the total working volume. There are seven other storages in the eastern part 
of Ukraine (Chyong, 2014).
In 2010, total natural gas supply was 2.3 EJ, higher than 
the figure for coal, at 1.6 EJ. Gas comprised a higher 
share of Ukraine’s total primary energy supply (42%), 
6 Households are eligible for targeted social assistance, if more than 
15% of the income of a household is paid for municipal services.power plants and the remainder 10% from CHPs. About 
half of the total was nuclear power generation. Generation of renewables was approximately 12 TWh, or 6.8% 
of the total. Almost all came from hydro facilities (IEA, 
2014a; SAEE, 2015). Policy support since 2009 has succeeded in increasing the rate of adoption for renewables 
technologies.
Ukraine has more than thirty power plants (including 
large hydro, but excluding renewables) and of which 
fourteen are thermal and another four are nuclear 
plants. There are also three large scale cogeneration 
plants (Korniush, 2012). Table 1 provides an overview of 
the existing power plants based on different sources for 
the period between 2011 and 2014. Ukraine had approximately 54 gigawatts (GW) of power generation capacity in 2013. Coal accounted for 40%, and nuclear plants 
25% whilst approximately 10% of the total installed 
capacity was large hydro. Most hydro power plants are 
situated along Ukraine’s major river – Dnipro. Most coal 
power plants are in the south eastern parts of Ukraine 
and several others are in the centre and east.
Peak demand on the main grid in 2013 was 22.1 GW and 
the average baseload in 2013 was 28.4 GW (Hydropowwith about 28% of it used in the power and district-heat 
sectors. That includes combined heat and power (CHP) 
plants. Another 26% was used in heating systems for 
individual buildings. Industry, agriculture and the fisheries sector used 12% of the total in steam boilers or direct 
heaters. The transport sector accounted for another 6%.
The remainder is used in the energy sector (e.g., oil and 
gas extraction) and stock changes (IEA, 2014a). Total 
natural gas consumption in Ukraine is decreasing. In 
the period between 2005 and 2014, total demand for 
households has decreased by 12% whereas the demand 
for industry has decreased even further by 49% (G7, 
2015). The decline for industry is related to the higher 
gas pricing, while for households, consumption has 
been subsidized.
The rest of this section focuses in greater detail on the 
current situation for power, district heat and the use of 
renewables in end-use sectors in Ukraine.
Power sector
In 2009, a total of 189 terawatt-hours (TWh) of power 
was generated in Ukraine. Of this total 90% came from

22,900 km of high voltage lines and 135 substations (between 220 and 750 kilovolts). 33 interstate lines connect 
Ukraine to its seven neighbour countries, and fourteen 
of these lines are with Russia (Korniush, 2012).
The share of renewables was still relatively low and 
was dominated by hydro with nearly 5.5 GW in 2011. A 
majority of hydro power plants are large-scale facilities, 
with ten at a capacity larger than 10 MW. Eight are on 
the Dnipro River and have a total capacity of 3.9 GW, 
and another is on the Dniester River and has 700 MW 
of capacity. No new plants are under construction 
(excluding pumped hydro), however the state body 
Ukrhydroenergo is rehabilitating ten facilities that together can offer 4.6 GW of capacity. These plants are 
approximately 50 years old (Liu, Masera and Esser, 2013; 
Hydropower & Dams, 2014). In 2010, only 49 of 150 small 
and micro hydro plants were in operation (OECD, 2012).
According to Liu, Masera and Esser (2013), in 2011 64 
small and hydro power plants were in operation. There 
are another 100 that can be restored. The use of other 
renewables for power generation is still small.
Ukraine’s power system is at risk today because of 
outdated facilities, inefficient plants and ageing transmission lines. Of the hydro and thermal plants, 95% 
are too old for use. Most coal plants were built around 
1970, which means they will need substantial upgrades 
or must be replaced before 2030. Nuclear capacity is 
newer, built after 1980, and is expected to be operational in 2030 (Platts, 2013). These aging plants offer 
an important opportunity because as these systems are 
renovated or replaced, investment can be directed to 
renewables as an alternative. The average annual capacity factor for thermal plants is about 27% and nuclear 
about 69%. Many of the small-scale hydro plants are 
also aging, with an average annual capacity factor of 
about 29%.
By the end of 2012, total renewable-electricity generation capacity in Ukraine had reached 728.3 megawatt 
(MW). Of this total, wind provided 277 MW, solar photovoltaic (PV) 371.6 MW, small-scale hydro 73.5 MW, and 
biomass and biogas facilities– 6.2 MW. This capacity 
generates 780 gigawatt-hour (GWh) per year of electricity, representing 5.8% of the total power generation.
Renewable energy capacity is growing in particular for 
solar technologies because of legislation supporting the 
industry. Solar capacity surged from 26 MW in December 2011 to 818 MW three years later (Romanko, 2014; 
SAEE, 2015).
By the end of the first half of 2014 total renewable energy power generation capacity operating under the 
GT reached 1,419 MW. This included 497 MW of wind,

Note: renewable energy capacities provided for end of 2012, 2013 and 2014 refer to facilities that operate under the green tariff.819 MW of solar PV, 77 MW from SHP and 26 MW of 
biomass and biogas. There are 18 wind plants in Ukraine, 
and about 371 MW of the total installed wind capacity 
is grid-connected (UWEA, 2013). The Crimea peninsula 
represents about 20% and 40% respectively of total 
installed wind and solar PV capacities. However by the 
end of 2014 total installed capacity under GT reached 
2,007 MW, an increase of 484 MW, or 32%. Renewable 
technologies accounted 6.2% of electricity generation 
in 2014.
District-heat sector
The heating sector in Ukraine can be divided into two 
main components: the district-heat sector, owned and 
operated by municipal heating companies; and heating 
systems to serve industry, such as boilers or direct firing 
units. Today there are 79,908 boilers for heat generation 
in Ukraine. The district heat sector is composed of about 
7,000 heat-only boilers and another 250 CHPs (Radeke 
and Kosse, 2013). Today, Ukraine’s district heat sector 
is inefficient for multiple reasons, and addressing them 
will be important for Ukraine’s energy-security goals as 
well as for the promotion of renewables.
In 2010, heat production from the district heat sector 
reached 640 PJ, with about one third of the total from 
CHP plants. Residential and commercial buildings consume 60% of the total district-heat generated, with the 
remainder going to industry. District heat accounts for 
nearly a quarter of TFEC in the buildings and industry 
sectors. About 39% of total households in Ukraine were 
connected to district heating, which is slightly lower 
than the 43% in 2011 (7.5 million out of the 17.5 million 
households) (IEA, 2012b; Radeke and Kosse, 2013). This 
share is among the highest in the world. All of Kiev’s 
three million residents rely on district heating. In comparison, 41% of the total number of households had individual gas-fired heating units, and 21% had other forms 
of heating based on either electricity or solid fuels such 
as coal or wood.
District-heating demand has fallen since the 1990s 
however, as a result of a decreasing population and increased efficiency, but with urbanisation and higher demand in non-residential sectors, it is expected to grow 
again (IEA, 2012b). District heating accounts for about 
one-fifth of Ukraine’s total natural gas consumption, 
and about 80% of the district-heat generation relies on 
natural gas. In 2010, this meant 18 billion m3 of natural 
gas (620 PJ). About half of all citizens live in multiapartment housing (240,000 buildings with a total area 
of 464 million m2) and 80% of that uses gas and district 
heating. Multi-apartment housing has a large energy efficiency improvement potential.
Biomass accounted for 3.6% of total district-heat generation, with small quantities of aero-thermal, geothermal 
and hydro-thermal heat pumps in use as well. Only a few 
of Ukraine’s provincial capitals (“oblast” in Ukrainian) 
have biomass boilers, but new ones are expected to be 
built starting in 2015.
The role of other renewables is growing for district 
heat. Between 2008 and 2012, the municipal utility of 
Mariupolteploset set up three solar thermal districtheat plants in Donetsk. Other municipalities have also 
announced projects under consideration (GSTEC, 2014).
Low efficiency is the major challenge to Ukraine’s district-heat sector. Nearly 60% of the heat produced is 
lost in production and distribution (Radeke and Kosse, 
2013), and both heat-distribution pipelines and generation systems need replacing. One of the reasons for 
this is that regulated tariffs aren’t enough to cover the 
costs of distribution and capital expenditure on top of 
that. Total heating cost for generators is about UAH 
325 per gigacalorie (Gcal), or USD 7.3, and the tariff is 
80% of that cost, at UAH 260. Another problem is that 
most equipment used is older than its technical life 
expectancy, sometimes by a factor of two (Radeke and 
Kosse, 2013). Precise billing is also a challenge because 
historically individual gas consumption has not been 
measured by meters. Only six percent of all households 
have meters, and fewer than 20% of buildings have 
functioning metering today. Today more meters are being installed and the amount of free gas per consumer 
is being reduced.
Efficiency improvements to the district-heat sector 
stand out as one of the most important potential contributions to Ukraine’s energy-intensity reduction goal 
of 50% by 2030. Improvements could include rehabilitation of the boiler houses, replacing network pipes, installation of heat substations and installing heat meters 
(IEA, 2012b; The World Bank, 2014). Higher heat tariffs 
can secure necessary investment in energy efficiency, 
and for the Ukrainian government a possible solution 
would be to allow tariff increases only if the extra rev-enue is used for investing in energy efficiency. Tariffs 
need to be affordable for consumers but increases can 
gain mass acceptance if they come with assurances of 
efficiency gains in the future.
The alternative to reforming the district-heat sector is to 
restructure the overall system in order to promote individual heating systems in buildings or industrial facilities 
currently connected to the grid.
Solid biomass use for heating
Renewable energy use by consumers (industry, transport, and residential and commercial buildings) is thus 
far limited. Biomass is the main source of renewable 
energy in end-use sectors, and Ukraine has focused on 
it as a domestic resource worth exploiting.
National sources indicate that Ukraine has 750-1,465 PJ 
(18-35 Mtoe/yr) of primary biomass economic potential that can substitute 21.6-26 billion m3 of natural gas 
(Bioenergy, 2014; SAEE, n.d.). There is also additional 
potential of about 100 PJ annually from biogas (SAEE, 
n.d). These potential estimates are updated annually, 
and depend on agricultural yields, cropping patterns, 
weather and climate conditions etc. Each year, Ukraine 
produces about 120 million tonnes of biomass feedstock.
This includes crop production, waste, animal, wood and 
food processing residues. 54% of the total production is 
further processed, 45% is wasted and 1% is used for power and heat generation (ProMarketing Ukraine, 2013).
In 2010, a total of 93 PJ of biomass was used in Ukraine, 
48 PJ of which was by end-use sectors (48 PJ per 
year) (IEA, 2014a). Residential heating and cooking accounted for 47 PJ. For the building sector the share of 
renewables in the mix in 2010 was about 11.5%, and in 
the overall heating sector less than 5%.
According to Matveev (2014), total biomass demand 
was constant at 93 PJ from 2010 to 2012, or 2,231 kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe). Another source found 
more, however: a report by the Centre for Renewable 
Energy Sources and Savings. A questionnaire from 2012 
estimates total demand at 108.2 PJ for covering the 
2009-2010 fiscal year, and 128.4 PJ for 2010-2011 (CRES, 
2012). Table 3 displays details for 2009. Firewood is 
the most common feedstock and is used by 92% of the 
households reporting biomass consumption. Half of 
firewood is supplied from biomass supply centres and 
one third directly from forests. The remainder is from 
the wood-processing industry.
The CRES survey provides a comprehensive overview of 
solid bioenergy markets in Ukraine. About 15% of households used some type of biomass for space heating, 
cooking or water heating, the report found. The share is

1 Values show consumption for energy generation in Ukraine. Export of pellets/briquettes is not included.higher in rural areas: 40% of households reported using 
biomass for their heating needs, compared with 5% in 
urban areas (CRES, 2012). Space heating accounts for 
58% of the total biomass demand, with 32% from cooking and 10% for heating water. There has been limited 
uptake of modern stoves, and most biomass use in the 
building sector is in traditional forms7.
Ukraine is also a producer of solid biomass products.
In 2012, there were 44 pellet producers in Ukraine and 
155 making fuel briquettes. Total production is about 
289 kilotonnes (kt) per year. These are mainly small 
companies with production outputs no larger than 2 kt 
of pellets in a month or 1 kt of briquettes. One company 
produces pellets and briquettes from straw. Over 90% 
of solid biofuel products were exported to EU countries, 
where there are effective incentive programmes for 
renewable energy (CRES, 2012).
The average cost of firewood in Ukraine is reported at 
USD 24 per tonne, or about USD 1.4 per GJ. Prices for 
other solid biomass ranged from USD 0.13 per GJ to 
4.9 in 2010. Wood-processing residues represented the 
low end of this range. Baled straw and firewood were 
priced around USD 2.2 per GJ including delivery. Wood 
pellets and briquettes ranged from USD 4.4 to 4.9. In 
2012 prices had risen by about 20% from 2010. Depending on the feedstock used, prices for large consumers 
and traders ranged from USD 4.7 per GJ (straw) to 6.0 
(husks). Demand for wood pellets is high in the EU, and 
domestic prices are typically 10-15% higher in winter 
(TEBODIN, 2013).
7 According to the IEA (2012a), biomass use in the residential sectors 
of non-OECD countries should be considered as traditional. However, National Renewable Energy Action Plan of Ukraine counts all 
biomass use as modern and as part of the renewable energy mix.
Biogas use
When Ukraine was a part of the former Soviet Union 
(FSU) biogas facilities were often constructed at water 
treatment and milk-processing plants. Only a few remain operational, but many new facilities are in design.
The slow development of biogas plants is attributed to 
two factors: the expense of the equipment and absence 
of feed-in tariffs for power from biogas. At the end of 
2014 there were seven biogas plants installed in Ukraine 
(Table 4). As of early 2015 seven additional plants are 
planned.
Biomass makes up 64% of municipal solid waste (MSW) 
in Ukraine. There are 6 LFG collection and utilisation systems operating in Ukraine, of which four are commercial 
systems and two are for demonstration (CRES, 2012).
Liquid biofuels use
Total ethanol production capacity in Ukraine is about 
131,000 tonnes per year. Actual production is between 
60,000 and 100,000 tonnes per year, in 13 state-owned 
and 20 private plants. The market price for domestically 
produced bioethanol in 2012 was between USD 1.85 and 
1.93 per tonne (TEBODIN, 2013). Total biodiesel production capacity is about 500,000 tonnes per year, and total production is about 100,000 tonnes per year. About 
three-quarters of production comes from small-scale 
plants with capacities ranging between 300 tonnes and 
5,000 tonnes annually (ProMarketing Ukraine, 2013).

equipment. Current Ukrainian policy foresees a considerable increase in solar energy use at industrial facilities 
and for agribusiness.

Source: SAEE (2015)The current energy policy of Ukraine, approved by government, is called Energy Strategy of Ukraine for the 
Period until 2030. It states that the use of renewables is 
important to improve energy security and to reduce the 
environmental impacts of the energy sector. Renewable 
energy in Ukraine is important on a national level but 
also has international implications: to help enhance energy security in Europe and to combat climate change.
Energy Strategy of Ukraine requires periodic adjustments 
because it is a long-term forecasting document, and in 
2011 the government drafted a new edition that was 
approved in July 2013. Changes focused on the strategy 
for developing the electricity sector, and in particular 
development of the domestic coal sector.
The indicative figures until 2030 and increase in energy 
efficiency proposed in the document were used in the 
NREAP when calculating Ukraine’s Reference Case to 
2030 (see Table 5). Values provided for the year 2030 
are estimated based on the trends observed between 
2014 and 2020 according to the NREAP. The heating

1 The gross final energy consumption comprises final energy consumption, network losses, own use of energy at electricity and heat plants 
(except consumption of electricity by pumped hydro storage plants for transformation in electric boilers or heat pumps at district heating 
plants, as defined in Article (2)(f) of Directive 2009/28/EC. 
2 The growth rate in GFEC of heating/cooling, electricity generation and transport for the period between 2010 and 2020/2030 is applied 
to the 2010 TFEC values to estimate the 2020 and 2030 Reference Case TFEC. Renewable energy use by technology and application for 
the years 2020 and 2030 Reference Case has been taken directly from the NREAP and the Energy Strategy of Ukraine, respectively. The 
conventional fuel mix is assumed to remain identical to the 2010 situation in the entire period of 2010-2030.
3 In the estimation of the TFEC in 2030, there are slight differences between the REmap analysis and the basic scenario of the Strategy:
– Electricity: Generation in 2030 will exceed the level of 2010 by 50%. It will be caused mainly by increase of consumption in industry 
(by 55%) and in services (by 100%) (CoM, 2014). The basic scenario of demand for electricity envisages a decrease of gross domestic 
product (GDP) electricity intensity by approximately 40%. To reach this level it is necessary to achieve 20% of decrease of specific 
consumption of electricity. This study assumes the same level of growth for electricity generation in the same period.
– Heating: According to the basic scenario of the Strategy, total consumption of heat should grow up to 271 million Gcal in 2030 (1,134 PJ/
yr), compared with 212 million Gcal in 2009. This represents a 28% growth between 2009 and 2030. Growth in the residential building 
sector is 12%, from 146 million Gcal to 161 million Gcal. Growth in industry is from 38 million Gcal to 57 million Gcal. If 2008 is taken as 
base year (56 million Gcal), this would, however, mean no growth in demand. In the commercial building sector, growth is from 28 million 
Gcal to 53 million Gcal (UABio, 2013a). This study assumes that heating demand will follow the trends that are projected between 2015 
and 2020. As a result, total demand for fuels in industry and buildings sectors for heating would increase from 1,264 PJ in 2010 to 1,425 
PJ in 2030. This is similar to the magnitude of growth projected for the residential buildings between 2009 and 2030. Total district heat 
demand would grow from 509 PJ to 590 PJ in the same period. These developments would imply a total growth of 14% in the same 
period.
– Transport: ln basic scenario of development of transport fleet, the total domestic demand for main light oil in 2030 will be about 17.4 
million tonnes (of those petrol – 6.3 million tonnes, diesel fuel – 10.1 million tonnes, kerosene – 1.0 million tonnes). This is equivalent to 
744 PJ per year liquid fuel use in 2030. This study assumes a lower growth in transport sector fuels to 560 PJ per year in 2030. According to the basic scenario of the Strategy, consumption of electricity in transport sector will reach 14 terawatt-hours per year (TWh/yr), 
which is also assumed in the REmap study.
– As a result of these developments, TFEC of Ukraine grows from 3.2 EJ in 2010 to 4.0 EJ in 2030 according to the REmap analysis. This 
growth is also in line with the findings of a study by Podolets and Diachuk (2013) which estimates the growth in Ukraine’s TFEC for the 
same time period based on the national TIMES-Ukraine model.
4. REFERENCE CASEand cooling sectors will account for about 60% to 65% 
of the Ukraine GFEC between 2009 and 2030, and 
about 20% to 25% will be accounted for by the power 
generation sector. The transport sector’s share will 
be between 13% and 14% for the period. GFEC would 
increase by 1.3% per year in the period 2009 and 2030.
This is opposite to the trend which has been observed 
in the past decade where Ukraine’s total demand for 
energy is decreasing on average by 1% per year.
The NREAP to 2020 was drafted by the State Agency 
of Ukraine for Energy Efficiency and Energy Saving 
(SAEE). This draft has been approved by the State 
Committee in 2014 (CoM, 2014). As part of the Energy 
Strategy of Ukraine, SAEE also provides the power 
generation and the related capacities from renewable 
sources for the year 2030 as well as the developments 
in the heating and transport sectors by technology.
According to the NREAP, renewable energy’s share in 
the Ukraine GFEC needs to reach 11% by 2020, which 
implies a total renewable energy use of 8,530 ktoe/yr 
(357 PJ/yr). In 2030 estimated renewable energy use 
would be 15,500 ktoe/yr (649 PJ/yr) in the business as 
usual. That would represent 17.7% of the estimated GFEC 
of 87,636 ktoe/yr. The GFEC of Ukraine would grow by 
32% in the period between 2009 and 2030 whereas 
total renewable energy use would jump by six-fold.
Figure 2 shows the developments in power production 
between 2009 and 2030. Total production will increase 
by 48.1% in the entire period, from 189 TWh to 284 
TWh. This is faster than the total growth of TFEC, 
indicating the increasing importance of power in 
Ukraine. Future additions in generation capacity are 
expected primarily from coal, hydro, nuclear and other 
renewables.
According to Figure 3 the share of renewable energy 
in the power sector is projected to nearly double, from 
6.9% in 2010 to 11.4% in 2030, with increases across all 
categories. For industry the share should jump from 
0.2% to 13.3%, and in building from 6.8% to 12.3%. For 
transport, the number would go from zero to 6.7%.
Figure 4 shows the projections for renewable-energy 
use in TFEC. Overall use is projected to increase from 
87 PJ in 2009 to 535 PJ in 2030. Bioenergy continues 
to dominate the mix, with its share expected to remain 
between 67% and 84% in the 2009-2030 period. Hydro’s 
portion will drop from 33% to 7% because of growth in 
wind and solar. However in the power sector specifically

hydro and wind will dominate (70% of total renewable 
power production), followed by biomass and solar PV.
Biomass will be the main source for the heating and 
transport sectors.Increasing the usage of renewable-energy sources and 
alternative fuels counts as an important part of Ukraine’s 
strategy to save on traditional fuel and energy resources 
and to reduce the related environmental impacts. The 
policy seeks to lower both supply and demand by 
pursuing efficiencies. It will also diversify fuel sources, 
therefore contributing to the energy independence of 
the state. The Ukrainian government has taken important steps for transforming the country’s energy sector, 
with the aim of increasing energy efficiency and improving energy security.
In September 2010, the Protocol on Accession of Ukraine 
to the Energy Community Treaty was signed and in 2011 
Ukraine became the full member of the Energy Community, which means it is expected to participate in 
integrating its energy sector with those of EU countries.
Directives on renewable energy sources set mandatory 
national goals, offer investment guarantees and encourage to development of advanced technologies and innovation. Ukraine assumed the obligation to source 11% 
level of energy from renewable sources by 2020.
Participation in the Energy Community gives Ukraine 
opportunities to enhance competition in the domestic 
market, learn about and adopt European technical 
standards and transparent regulations and improve its 
investment climate. It also offers deeper integration of 
the Ukrainian energy sector with EU countries, enhancing its own energy security. Membership also increases 
access to international loans and technical assistance. In 
response to Ukraine’s Energy Community obligations, 
Ukraine drafted the NREAP for the period until 2020 
(SAEE, 2012). The NREAP has been approved by the 
State Committee in 2014 (CoM, 2014).
In 2010, the Ukrainian government released the Programme of Economic Reforms for 2010-2014. This covers energy, among other sectors of the economy. The 
programme addresses key energy issues and the need 
for reform in various areas. The programme also to attract investments and move to a tariff regime that covers all production costs. The Energy Strategy of Ukraine 
is key in realising these reforms. In the 2006 edition 
of the Energy Strategy of Ukraine, it was mentioned 
that renewable energy would be essential to improve 
Ukraine’s energy sector. The strategy requires periodic 
adjustments, because it is a long-term forecasting document, and in 2011 the Ukrainian government decided to 
draft a new edition. The revised version was released 
in 2012, and it was subsequently approved in July 2013 
(IEA, 2012b; SAEE, 2015).
A number of institutions have responsibility regarding 
Ukraine’s energy policy, which is coordinated by the 
Cabinet of Ministers (CoM), which also has oversight of 
state energy companies. For example, the Ministry of 
Energy and Coal is responsible for power sector planning and energy supply policies. Ministry of Agriculture 
is responsible for liquid biofuels (IEA, 2012b; SAEE, 
2015).
As a transit country to Europe for both natural gas 
and crude oil, Ukraine plays an important role in the 
energy security of European Union as well. Around 15% 
of Europe’s total gas supply is met through the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod (Brotherhood) pipeline (running through Ukraine and entering Slovakia). A total of 
83 billion m3 natural gas entered Europe in 2013 from 
this pipeline (IEA, 2014b).
Overview of institutional, regulatory 
and legal frameworks for renewable 
energy
The following bodies have briefs that directly or indirectly impact the energy sectors of Ukraine:

The National Commission for State Energy and Public 
Utilities Regulation (NCSEPUR) is a state collective 
body that is subordinate to the President of Ukraine and 
reports to Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada.
Until 2014 this body was known as the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC). Its main areas 
of oversight are:
l regulation of activity of entities of natural monopolies and business entities carrying out activity in the areas of electricity, including power 
plants of all types;
l supervising natural gas markets, including upstream assets such as associated-gas fields, coalbed methane and shale gas (hereinafter referred 
to as the natural gas);
l oil and oil products;
l pricing and tariff policy for energy, including 
GT;
l as recycling and disposal of waste.
The Ministry of Energy and Coal Industry of Ukraine, 
through the State Enterprise Ukrenergo, provides technical conditions and concluding agreements on the 
connection of renewable energy facilities to power 
networks.
The Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of 
Ukraine reviews ecological concerns and approves 
construction plans for renewable energy facilities.
These laws, codes and directives, resolutions and 
regulatory frameworks also shape the energy sectors 
of Ukraine:
1. Law of Ukraine “On Alternative Fuels”: specifies 
legal, social, economic, ecological and institutional principles for generation and use of alternative fuels as well 
as incentives to increase use.
2. Law of Ukraine “On Alternative Energy Sources”:
specifies legal, economic, ecological and institutional 
principles for using alternative energy sources and promotes increased use.
3. Law of Ukraine “On Combined Generation of Thermal Energy and Electricity (Cogeneration) and Usage of Waste Potential”: specifies legal principles for 
improving the efficiency of fuel use in the processes of 
energy generation or other technological processes; for 
developing and applying electricity and thermal energy 
combined-generation technologies; for increasing reliability and security of power supply at a regional level, 
and for attracting investment to construct cogeneration 
installations.
4. Law of Ukraine “On Electricity Sector”: specifies 
legal, economic and institutional principles and 
relationships for generating, transmitting, supplying and 
using energy; addresses energy security, competition 
and protects the consumers and employees of the 
industry.
5. Tax Code of Ukraine: specifies peculiarities of taxation and the granting of privileges to business entities 
that develop, generate, introduce and use renewableenergy sources. At the time of this report (February 
2015) all tax incentives for facilities in renewable power 
have been cancelled, save for these exceptions:
l according to subparagraph 213.2.8, paragraph 
213.2, Article 2013 of Ukrainian Tax Code, electricity generated by qualified CHP units and from 
renewables is exempt from excise dutyl The following operations are exempt from VAT 
tax until January 1st, 2019: under Article Seven of 
the Law of Ukraine ”About Alternative Fuels”
— The supply of machinery, equipment and facilities
— The production and reconstruction of vehicles 
not available currently in Ukraine that would 
consume biofuels, including self-propelled 
agricultural machines
6. Customs Code of Ukraine: sets rules for importing 
equipment, machinery and materials for renewableenergy projects.
7. Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine 
“On Adoption of the State Target Economic Programme for Energy Efficiency and Development of 
Generation of Fuels from Renewable Energy Sources 
and Alternative Fuels for 2010-2015”: outlines conditions to decrease the level of energy use as a percentage of GDP from 2010 to 2015 by 4% annually, for a total 
of 20%, and to increase the share of renewable energy 
sources and alternative fuels in Ukraine’s energy mix.
8. Instruction of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine 
“On Approval of Energy Strategy of Ukraine for the 
Period until 2030”: this long-term planning document 
was most-recently updated and approved on 24 July 
2013. Its goal is to increase the share of renewables in 
the country’s energy mix as a way to improve energy 
security and reduce environmental impacts associated 
with energy consumption. Specific objectives to reach 
that goal include:
l determining strategies and creating the conditions for a safe, reliable and sustainable energy 
sector that is developed to the greatest extent 
possible;
l ensuring the energy security of the state;
l decreasing the technogenic burden on Ukraine’s 
environment and ensuring civil protection in the 
area of fuel security;
l decreasing generation losses and using energy 
products through efficient consumption, introducing energy-saving technologies and equipment, streamlining the structure of public generation and reducing reliance on energy-intensive 
technologies;
l integrating the Unified Power System of Ukraine 
with the European Power Network and progressively increasing electricity imports, which would 
strengthen the position of Ukraine as a transit 
country for oil and gas.
9. Instruction of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine 
of 03.09.2014 # 791-r “Plan of measures to implement the Directive 2009/28/EC of 23 April 2009 on 
the promotion of the use of energy from renewable 
sources and amending and subsequently repealing 
Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC”.
10. Instruction of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine 
of 01.10.2014 # 902-r “On National Renewable Energy 
Action Plan for the period until 2020”.
11. Instruction of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of 
16.10.2014 # 1014-r “On approving the plan of shortand medium-term measures to reduce natural gas 
consumption for the period until 2017”.
The system of respective financial preferences for energy conservation and renewable-energy sources was 
created in Ukraine and explained in the tax and customs 
codes and in the Law of Ukraine “On Electricity Sector”, 
namely:
l introducing the GT;
l decreasing land-tax rates for renewable energy 
enterprises;
l tax exemptions for:
— profit from the generating of electricity from 
renewable sources;
— profit from the sale of biofuel but its producers;
— profit from CHP facilities or the generation of 
thermal energy using biological fuels;
— profit from manufacturing machinery and 
equipment required to build or rebuild vehicles powered by biological fuels;
— value-added activities related to importing 
of certain types of renewable-energy equipment;
— exemption from import duties for certain 
types of renewable-energy equipment;
The Law of Ukraine “on Electricity Sector” stipulates 
some exceptions to which the GT cannot be applied.
Amongst alternative energy sources these are blastfurnace and coke gases. In the hydro sector large-scale 
plans do not qualify. For electricity producers using re-Table 6: Green tariff coefficients for facilities commissioned

Source: Adapted from Savchuk (2014)newables, the GT is set at the retail tariff for consumers 
of second class of voltage as of January 2009 and then 
multiplied by the GT coefficient. After 2014, 2019 and 
2024 these will decrease by 10%, 20% and 30% of their 
basic values respectively (Table 6).
For electricity produced using alternative energy sources (except for blast-furnace and coke gases), and construction of which started after 1 January 2012, GT is applied only when requirements for local content are met.
Local-content thresholds do not apply to the generating 
installations of private households and micro, mini and 
small hydro power plants, and therefore qualify for 
the GT regardless of local content.
Table six outlines the actions Ukraine has taken to promote energy efficiency and reduce its natural gas usage 
by 50% within the next decade (Savchuk, 2014).6. RENEWABLES POTENTIAL
structure of energy supply, however. Within this sector small rivers in Ukraine, mainly in western regions, 
comprise almost 28% of total SHP potential from rivers.
Micro, mini and small hydro power potential are found 
in all regions of western Ukraine but in particular in the 
provinces of Zakarpatska and Chernivetska.
SHP can help save fuel and energy resources and contribute to the decentralisation of the energy system.
That would address energy-supply issues in remote 
areas, contributing to energy security in the process.
Ukraine has sufficient scientific and technical potential 
and considerable experience needed to address challenges in the development of SHP, as turbines and other 
equipment can be designed and developed by the domestic industry sector (CoM, 2014; SAEE, 2015).
Solar power
The average annual amount of total energy from solar irradiation in Ukraine ranges from 1,070 kilowatt 
hours (kWh)/m2 in northern regions to as much as 
1,400  kWh/m2 to the south, and higher in the Crimea 
peninsula. Solar PV equipment can be efficiently operated throughout the year but the months of peak effiAs of February 2015 the annual technically achievable energy potential of renewable energy sources of 
Ukraine was 68.6 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) 
per year. This is equivalent to 98 million tonnes of fuel 
equivalent. This would be sufficient to replace approximately half of the total energy consumption in Ukraine 
today (Table 8) (SAEE, 2015).
Wind power
Ukraine’s total wind potential is between 16 GW and 24 
GW (DTEK, n.d.; WWEA, 2012), with 16 GW considered 
economically feasible. The most promising regions are 
the southern and south-western regions, where average 
annual wind speed at the height of 80 meters exceeds 
7.5 meters per second (m/s) (CoM, 2014; SAEE, 2015).
Hydro power
Technically feasible potential is 21.5 TWh annually (Hydropower & Dams 2014, more than double the 10.4 TWh 
generated in 2013. Annual technical achievable potential 
for SHP is estimated at 20.1 TWh. The current SHP capacity is 77 MW. Because it is a minor element of the 
total energy balance (0.2%), SHP cannot influence the

Source: SAEE (2015)ciency are from April to October in southern regions and 
May to September in northern ones. Based on various 
studies, there is a 4 GW reasonable potential in Ukraine 
for solar power.
The transformation of solar energy into electricity in 
Ukraine should be mainly through the use of solar PV 
devices. The raw materials and the industrial and intellectual capacity to manufacture them locally would 
meet domestic demand and also open up export opportunities (CoM, 2014; SAEE, 2015).
Solar thermal
Flat plate collectors that can utilize both the direct and 
dispersed solar radiation, are the most suitable option 
for Ukraine, in particular in the north parts. In contrast, 
concentrating solar collectors would be effective in the 
southern parts. There is an estimated potential of 20-22 
million m2 (Table 9).
Biomass
Ukraine has high potential to expand biomass use for 
energy purposes, primarily for heating. The country has 
abundant agricultural and forestry waste, and this is a 
key resource for the development of biomass-based 
heat and power generation capacity. There is 42.8 million hectares of land that is equivalent to 71% of the 
country’s total area. 32.5 million hectares of the total 
agricultural land is arable. Furthermore, it has one of 
the most fertile soils in the world, the so-called “chernozem”. This helps to maintain sufficient agricultural 
productivity rates in Ukraine, despite the low use of fertilizers (ProMarketing Ukraine, 2013).
According to the estimates from SAEE economically 
feasible bioenergy potential exceeds 800 PJ/yr – 
equivalent to a quarter of Ukraine’s TFEC. This supply 
potential consists half from agricultural waste and 
woody biomass and half from energy crops and biogas 
(Table 10).
The resource potential of woody biomass in Ukraine 
amounts to 4 Mt annually. It includes sawmill waste, 
wood-cutting waste (branches, crowns), firewood and 
some technical timber, which is currently exported. It is 
unlikely for this structure to change significantly in the 
near future. While there is additional forest potential, 
road transportation of the lumber is a limiting factor 
for heating and power generation. More than 10 megatonnes (Mt) of surplus straw remains in farmers’ fields 
every year, and collecting it for use is a challenge. Most 
agricultural enterprises are not able to gather, bundle 
and adequately store straw.
Wood residues are mostly available in the northern 
and western parts of Ukraine. In comparison, primary 
agricultural waste is available in the centre and eastern 
parts whilst, energy crops can be grown in the eastern 
parts of Ukraine (van der Hilst et al., 2013). Both wood 
biomass and agricultural residues can replace aging 
power generation in the eastern, northern and southern 
parts of Ukraine (Black & Veatech, 2011).
IRENA has been preparing biomass-potential studies 
with an outlook to the year 2030 for each of the REmap 
countries (IRENA, 2014b). In Ukraine the potential is 
estimated to be between 1,115 PJ and 1,780 PJ. The high 
end of this range is nearly double the supply potential 
in 2013. Agricultural residues and waste (biogas) would 
account for 53% to 58% of this potential, and wood residues and waste about 12%. The share of energy crops

Passive solar heating 1 5and fuel wood would range from 19% to 31% and 0% to

There is a rapid growth in energy crops expected in 
Ukraine, and by 2015-2020 output could reach the level 
of output of straw and overtake it after 2020. Energy 
crops are planned for cultivation on non-agricultural 
lands such as river valleys, reclaimed municipal solid 
waste (MSW) areas, mine sites, etc. Most available plant 
resources for energy biomass production are expected 
to be commercialised by 2020. Organic matter recycling 
for biogas, heat and power production is expected to 
continue growing, but there is unlikely to be significant 
expansion in landfill gas.

Ukraine has a sufficient number of geothermal deposits 
with high temperature potential, between 120 degrees 
Celsius (°C) and 180°C. These temperature are sufficient 
for power generation.
Based on various estimates the economically viable 
energy resource of thermal waters in Ukraine is about 
8.4 Mtoe/yr. Geothermal water heating is already in effect 
in the Crimea peninsula, where 11 geothermal-circulation 
systems are operating. These systems comply with modern technologies for extraction of geothermal heat, and 
plants are operating at both pilot and industrial stages.
Large reserves of thermal waters are found also in 
the provinces of Chernihivska, Poltavska, Kharkivska, 
Luhanska and Sumska. Hundreds of wells containing 
thermal water are currently mothballed and could be 
renewed and used for geothermal heat.This section explains the REmap Options, which are 
renewable sources that can be used in addition to those 
in the Reference Case. Table 12 contrasts renewable energy use in 2009, the base year of the Ukraine NREAP, 
with what is expected in 2030. Results for the year 2030 
are provided separately for the Reference Case and for 
REmap 2030.
With all REmap Options implemented total renewable 
energy use in Ukraine’s TFEC would reach 872 PJ. Onefifth of this would be for renewable power consumption 
(188 PJ) and four-fifths for renewable gas, heat and 
fuels (684 PJ). Total renewable energy use in Ukraine’s 
TFEC would reach 21.8% in REmap 2030, compared 
to 3.0% in 2009 and 13.2% in 2030 Reference Case.
Installed renewable-energy capacity would increase 
from 13.2 GW in the Reference Case to 29.1 GW, a difference of 15.9 GW. The increase comes from wind (an 
additional 9 GW), solar PV (5.5 GW) and biomass power 
(1.4 GW). All of the additional biomass power capacity 
in REmap 2030 is assumed to be used for industrial 
CHP. No capacity additions are assumed for hydro or for 
geothermal power.
Total installed wind power capacity with REmap Options would be about 12 GW, requiring 380 MW of new 
capacity installation annually between 2009 and 2030.
That is a pace similar to what has already been established in recent years in Ukraine. Total installed solar 
PV capacity would climb to 8 GW which would require 
570 MW year of new capacity every year in that same 
period. This annual installation rate would be higher 
than the pace in 2012 and 2013, of 430 MW per year.
Total biomass power capacity would reach 3 GW with 
the REmap Options, from a level of about 1.6 GW. All of 
installed capacity would be used for CHP. About 1.4 GW 
of the total CHP capacity is used by the industry sector, 
with 1.6 GWfor district heat CHP.
As a result of these additions total renewable energy 
power generation would increase to 70.9 TWh/yr in 
comparison with the Reference Case. This is equivalent 
to a 25% share for renewable energy in Ukraine’s power 
generation sector, and more than four-fold increase 
compared to the 2009 level.
There would be significant new capacity in the heating 
and transport sectors as well. The largest increase would 
be from biomass. Total final biomass demand for transport fuels and for heating, including district heat, would 
jump by 45% to 761 PJ/yr with the REmap Options, 
compared with 522 PJ in the Reference Case.
Other sources for heat would increase as well for the 
residential, industrial and district-heat sectors. Biomass’ 
share in the fuel mix for the district heat sector reaches 
21%, from a previous 17% in the Reference Case 2030. In 
the building sector the share would also be 22% (excluding the use of electricity and district heat from biomass 
and other renewable energy sources). In the residential 
sector, total solid biomass use would be about 134 PJ 
per year, and biogas use about 27 PJ per year. This is 
equivalent to 8 Mt/yr of solid biomass and 3.3 billion m3
biogas use by 2030. Solid biomass use in the industry 
sector is expected to be higher. For heat generation in 
biomass-fired CHP and heat-only boilers, a total of 92 PJ 
and 160 PJ biomass, respectively would be required. Biogas demand is lower, estimated at 10 PJ per year with 
the REmap Options implemented.
Total installed capacity for solar thermal could increase 
to 19 million m2 (13 GW). About 2 million m2 would be 
in the industrial sector (about 1.8 MW capacity) and the 
remaining 17 million m2 in the residential sector (11.5 GW 
capacity). Solar thermal would account for about 3% of 
Ukraine’s building sector TFEC.
The Reference Case sees significant growth in electrification for heating with heat pumps, and partly through 
other technologies such as electric boilers and resistance heating. With REmap Options used no further 
electrification technology options are needed.
Total liquid biofuel use in the transport sector would 
reach 63 PJ if Remap Options are used. About a quarter of total consumption would come from advanced 
biofuels produced from non-food crops. The remainder 
would come from food-based crops. Total demand for

1 NREAP 2020 is the basis for the renewable energy use to 2020 in the Reference Case. Estimates for 2030 power capacity and generation 
as well as for growth in the heating and transport sectors are based on SAEE estimates. 
2 All biomass generation according to NREAP 2020 is assumed to be CHP. It is assumed that this trend will continue to 2030 as well in the 
Reference Case. In the Reference Case all biomass-CHP plants are assumed to be used for generating power and district heat, hence the 
deployment of industrial biomass-CHP is excluded from the Reference Case. To estimate the related district-heat generation, a power-toheat ratio of 0.3 and 0.75 are assumed for solid biomass- and biogas-fired CHPs, respectively (UABio, 2013b). Total power generation in 
2030 is slightly higher than the estimates of UABio (2013b) of 12 TWh per year (including solid biomass and biogas, but excluding co-firing). 
UABio (2013b) estimates a total installed CHP capacity of 1.6 GW compared to 3 GW in this study for the year 2030. The difference in total 
capacity is explained by the higher potential estimated for industrial CHP (see notes 6 to 8 of this table) and the lower capacity factors 
used in REmap 2030 (50% compared to 60-70%).
3 Solar thermal heating in the industry and building sectors is assumed to grow at an annual installation rate of about 600 MWth per year 
between 2009 and 2030, close to the recent trends that are seen in Australia, Germany and the United States (AEE-INTEC, 2014).conventional bioethanol production would use about 
one-third of Ukraine’s total energy-crop supply potential.
Table 13 shows renewable-energy developments by sector between 2010 and 2030 as well as total renewable 
energy use by sector with REmap Options used. The 
building and industry sectors would have the largest 
renewable energy share, at about 22-27% not including renewable electricity and district heat uses. When 
these are accounted for the sectors’ renewable energy 
share is estimated at 22.2% and 25.0%, respectively. The 
transport sector’s renewable-energy share would rise 
to 11.3% from nearly zero in 2010. The industry sector 
4 For industrial-process heating a modest capacity increase growth in REmap 2030 is assumed of 6 PJ (140 ktoe/yr), compared with the 
economic potential of about 350 PJ per year (see Section 6). 
5 Compared with biomass-fired CHP district heat systems (coupled with renewable power generation), growth in heat–only district heat 
systems in the Reference Case is rather modest. They accounted for 17% of the total district heat generation as of February 2015. A potential 
fifty percent higher than the Reference Case is assumed for heat alone systems, that would take their share in total biomass-based district 
heat generation to 50 percent. Total installed heat-only district heat systems in REmap 2030 reaches 2.5 GW as opposed to UABio (2013a,c) 
estimates of about 4 GW. Instead, a larger capacity of heat-only systems are estimated for the building and industry sectors in REmap 2030.
6 NREAP 2020 indicates the use of renewables for heating in households separately. All capacity was assumed to be solid biomass use in 
stand-alone boilers. In REmap 2030 an additional biomass potential of 60 PJ was assumed for buildings, adding 5 PJ in the commercial 
sector, 38 PJ of solid biomass for households and 17 PJ of biogas for households. Together with deployment in industry, these additions 
would increase the annual rate of biomass capacity implementation for end-use sectors by 50% between 2009 and 2030. These estimates 
are in line with SAEE’s projections to 2035 if policies were to remain the same as they currently are. 
7 All additional solid biomass-based power generation capacity in REmap 2030 is assumed to be industrial CHP, a technology which sees no 
growth in the Reference Case. This adds about 90 PJ biomass use to the industry sector to co-generate heat. An additional potential of 4 
PJ is assumed for direct heat and steam generation.
8 Total heating capacity in REmap 2030 reaches 32.2 GW (6.9 GW for district heating, 13.6 GW for the residential sector, and 11.7 GW for industrial and commercial sectors). This total can be disaggregated to 9 GW CHP (thermal capacity) and 23.2 GW heat-only systems. REmap 2030 
estimates are double the capacity estimated by the UABio (2013a,c) for 2030 (17.7 GW). There are a number of reasons for the differences.
Total industrial CHP capacity is 4.7 GW in REmap 2030 compared to 1.5 GW according to UABio (2013a,c). Total heat-only industrial heat 
generation capacity is 7 GW in REmap 2030 compared to 1.5 GW according to UABio (2013a,c). This study assumes a quarter of all low and 
medium temperature heat generation in the industrial sector of Ukraine would be from biomass-fired industrial CHPs (92 PJ). It further assumes about 25% of total clinker production and 5% of iron/steel production heat demand to be supplied with biomass and waste (36 PJ) 
(both high temperature heat applications). The remainder (124 PJ) is consumed to generate process heat in (steam and direct heat) boilers 
for varying temperature levels that represents about 20% of all low and medium temperature process heat demand in Ukraine’s industry.
Total residential heat generation capacity in REmap 2030 is 13.6 GW compared to 5.1 GW in UABio (2013a,c). The difference is to large extent 
explained by the lower capacity factor used in REmap 2030 compared to UABio (2013a,c) (30% versus 45%).
Total district heat generation capacity in REmap 2030 is 6.9 GW compared to 9.7 GW in UABio (2013a,c). These are estimated assuming 
50% capacity factor for CHP in REmap 2030, compared to 90% in UABio (2013a,c). When REmap 2030 capacity factor is used, the UABio 
(2013a,c) total capacity would be even higher at 13.9 GW.
For biomass-based heating, REmap 2030 assumes the use of more decentralised heat generation in the industry and residential sectors as 
opposed to the UABio (2013a,c) study which assumes more centralised district heat generation.
9 In the Reference Case, ethanol and biodiesel represent about 15% and 6% of the total gasoline and diesel volumes respectively. Additions in 
REmap 2030 take ethanol’s share to 19% (1.7 billion litres) and that of diesel to more than 20% (0.8 billion litres). The estimates for REmap 
2030 are slightly higher than what is envisioned for Ukraine by 2035 according to its Reference Case, where ethanol is at 1.5 billion litres, 
and biodiesel at 0.63 billion litres.

would account for about half of the total renewable energy use in Ukraine’s TFEC, followed by buildings (43%) 
and transport (10%).
In terms of resource use, biomass would be the most 
important source of renewables in Ukraine, with a total share of 76% of the total renewable energy use in 
REmap 2030 (see Figure 5). Solar and wind would account for 7% and 10%, respectively. The share of hydro 
would drop to 4% by 2030, compared with 32% in 2009, 
because of the substantial growth in all other renewable 
energy sources in the 2009-2030 period.
Total primary biomass demand would be 820 PJ/yr in 
REmap 2030 (Figure 6). That suggests that 45% to 75% 
of domestic potential will be utilised. Domestic potential 
is between 1,100 PJ and 1,800 PJ. Almost 70% would be 
supplied from two sources: agricultural residues (360 
PJ) and from wood and wood residues (200 PJ).
The heating sector would account for 77% of total biomass demand in 2030, with the balance coming from 
the transport sector (15%) and power generation (8%).
About 60% of all biomass use for heating would be a 
part of industrial and agricultural processes, with the 
remainder for buildings and district heating.
Total biogas demand would be 61 PJ, compared to 
Ukraine’s estimated supply potential of about 185 PJ per 
year in 2030.
Costs of renewables in Ukraine
Table 14 provides an overview of the substitution costs 
by sector for the business and government perspectives 
for the year 2030. The business perspective is based on 
a discount rate of 10% and takes into account energy tax 
and subsidies in energy prices in Ukraine. In comparison, 
the government perspective also uses a 10% discount 
rate but is based on international and regional energy 
prices that exclude tax and subsidies.
The cost of REmap Options are more expensive from 
the perspective of business than from government. For 
business the most cost-effective options are found in Figure 6: Breakdown of primary biomass use in Ukraine, 2030

the industry and district heat sectors, whereas fulfilling 
needs in transport and power sectors would be more 
expensive. From a government perspective the Remap 
Options are less expensive because unless of Ukraine’s 
subsidy regime. More renewables means importing less 
natural gas, which is comparatively expensive.
Figure 7 and Figure 8 ranks the costs of substitution of 
REmap Options and shows their contributions to the 
potentially increased share of renewable energy.
Table 15 shows the substitution costs of REmap Options 
in 2030 for Ukraine (same information plotted in 
Figure 7 and Figure 8). From a government perspective 
many biomass, biogas or biofuel technologies are cost 
competitive. The ones that are incrementally more 
expensive are biomass for industry and district heat, 
and solar technologies for buildings. From the business 
perspective, subsidised natural gas costs less and results 
in high substitution costs, particularly for the buildings 
sector.Figure 8: Renewable energy cost supply curve by renewable energy resource in 2030 based on the government

would be costlier is wind power, however by only a small

largely because of low capacity factors.
Transport sector biofuel technologies are the most 
cost-competitive compared to all other REmap Options, 
when compared to expensive gasoline and diesel.
Benefits of REmap Options
Table 16 shows the developments in fossil fuel demand 
between 2010 and 2030 in Ukraine. REmap Options 
would reduce total fossil fuel demand by 17% compared 
to the Reference Case. The savings range from 5% for oil 
products to 21% for coal. Total natural gas use in REmap 
2030 would be similar to the 2012 level (approximately

amount to USD 5.0 billion per year on average. Spending at USD 2.5 billion per year is required to fulfil the 
Reference Case, and an extra USD 2.5 billion per year 
would be needed to develop the REmap Options. Technologies which require a subsidy (positive substitution 
costs from the government perspective) lie in solar 
thermal for heating, solar PV, onshore wind and various 
biomass-based heat generation technologies. The subsidy need per MWh of final renewable energy is equivalent to USD 11, excluding the effect of any carbon price.
The table also shows that Ukraine can cut its energy bill by USD 4.7 billion a year by implementing 
REmap Options that use less fossil fuels. Of that total, 
USD 2.9 billion, or about 60% of the savings, would 
be from lowering natural gas imports. Remap Options would increase costs for biomass however, by 
USD 1.5 billion per year. Hence the net fuel savings in 
2030 with REmap Options is estimated at USD 3.2 billion per year over the Reference Case.
Implications of renewables on 
Ukraine’s natural gas use
The government’s aim is to halve gas consumption 
through various measures, and by 2018 eliminate its 
dependence on imported gas (Figure 10). Ukraine would 
also meet all its potential demand, 21.5 billion cubic 
meters, with domestic production. About 40% of the 
total would be used for industry, but that supply would 
43 billion m3), and 16% lower than the Reference Case 
(7.6 billion m3 savings). Coal use would be 11% lower 
compared to 2012 levels and oil products use 1%. Renewables will play an important role to reduce the demand 
for coal and natural gas by 2030.
The table also shows an 18% reduction in carbon dioxide 
(CO2) emissions from REmap Options compared to the 
Reference Case or 57 Mt per year. Of this total, 70% of 
the savings is from power generation. The remainder is 
split between 20% heating and 10% transport.
Figure 9 shows the same information about the savings 
in fossil fuel use as a result of the REmap Options and 
also highlights the change in total renewable energy 
use between the Reference Case and REmap 2030. If all 
REmap Options identified in this study are to be implemented by 2030, renewable energy use would grow by 
between 66% and 74% compared to the Reference Case.
As a result, renewables would be the third largest source 
of energy following coal and natural gas.
Table 17 shows a number of financial indicators for 
Ukraine (all from a government perspective). REmap 
Options result in savings of USD 175 million per year in 
2030. Externalities related to human health can increase 
these savings by USD 0.1 billion to USD 0.3 billion per 
year. Based on a price range of USD 20 to USD 80 per 
tonne for CO2, related externalities can save another 
USD 1 billion to USD 5 billion per year. Therefore, when 
accounting for externalities REmap Options can result 
in total savings of up to USD 5.5 billion per year in 2030.

government. The remaining 60% would be used by retail 
consumers and utility companies.
Based on the assumptions made in this study Figure 
11 shows the evolution of the fuel mix for Ukraine 
for heating and power generation between 2010 and 
2030. The main assumption is that as Ukraine’s TFEC 
grows, there will be no change in conventional-fuel 
use mix between 2010 and 2030 in the Reference Case 
(including fossil fuels and nuclear power). Natural gas 
would continue to account for half of the total fuel 
demand for heating, a share that is only slightly lower 
than the 2010 level of 58%. Consumption of gas for 
heating would increase by 4% between 2010 and 2030, 
but biomass by more than seven times. Natural gas use 
for power generation would remain at the 2010 level 
in 2030, whereas demand for renewables and nonrenewables would increase by three times and 45%, 
respectively. Natural gas would account for 7% of the 
total power generation by 2030 compared to 8% in 
2010.

If the current policies remained unchanged there would 
be fewer factors shrinking natural gas demand in the 
period to 2030. However with all REmap Options implemented demand for natural gas for heating and power 
generation would drop by 15% by 2030 compared to 
2010 levels. This estimate assumes that renewables 
displace mostly natural gas for heating and to some 
extent for power generation. Exceptions would be onshore wind and biomass for CHP, both of which would 
displace coal. Some natural gas would be required still 
to maintain the flexibility of the power system at higher 
levels of renewable-based power generation. Reducing 
gas demand by 50% through the use of renewables 
would require energy-efficiency enhancements and 
continued fuel switching. Furthermore, increasing domestic gas production and storage, and diversifying 
supply (through LNG imports for example) could also 
help.8. BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
RENEWABLE ENERGY TRANSITION
enhanced interconnection capacity could be considered 
with neighbouring countries.
From government there is a need for streamlined permitting procedures and improving electricity-market 
access for renewables producers. There is also a lack 
of cost-recovery mechanisms and clear procedures for 
grid connection. More knowledge about grid constraints 
and grid stability will be important to help determine 
the best construction strategies for renewable energy 
plants. More should also be done to assess affordability 
and define the fuel mix for power generation (for both 
renewables and non-renewables), to keep power prices 
from uncontrolled growth. Finally, availability of incentives for small and medium-size projects will be important in view of the estimated potential in the residential 
sector as well as for Ukraine’s industry sector, with many 
small and medium-scale plants.
Ukraine should also develop systems for standardisation 
and certification of solid and liquid biofuels. Local-content requirements combined with the lack of domestic 
production of modern renewable energy equipment 
limits the availability of affordable and reliable equipment. Domestic biomass boilers are expensive per unit 
of capacity, and also not available in large capacities.
Biogas plants are expensive and generally produced 
with foreign expertise, even though such plants could 
be locally produced at much lower cost.
Biomass will clearly be the main source of renewables 
in Ukraine in the future, however there are no regulations to mandate the use of bioenergy where an exploitable resource exists. One example that could be 
implemented is the compulsory inclusion of a biogas 
plant in major new projects by agro-food companies. In 
addition to demand-side policies to accelerate capacity 
deployment, policy support will be necessary to create 
a sustainable and affordable biomass supply market.
There is a significant supply potential, but how it will 
be utilized needs to be carefully planned when meeting 
the future demand growth. Ukraine has a large territory 
and the biomass resource potential is dispersed across 
the country. While locating processing and conversion 
Ukraine’s energy system offers a number of commercial 
opportunities for both new construction and refurbishments, given the outdated power-and-heat production 
capacities and the demand growth expectations. There 
is also a growing business case for renewables for district heating and industry, as both of these sectors are 
increasingly paying high prices for their natural gas. The 
NREAP to 2020 and the longer-term Ukrainian energy 
strategy are promising steps to planning and target setting that will help to accelerate the uptake of renewable 
energy in Ukraine. However barriers remain that could 
inhibit the greater use of renewable-energy resources 
in Ukraine.
Overcoming these barriers starts with increased understanding of renewables, their potential, cost and 
benefits. In terms of resource assessment capabilities, 
Ukraine enjoys advanced capacity to measure biomass 
flows and estimate annual availability for energy use. In 
the case of wind, Ukraine’s second-largest renewable 
energy resource, a lack of national wind measurements 
in accordance with international standards creates a 
challenge. Comprehensive measurement campaigns are 
essential for ensuring investor confidence and developing bankable projects. For example, waste streams offer 
an important alternative to fossil fuels in the agro-food 
sector but awareness of opportunities for utilising their 
energy content is low. Developing bankable projects 
also requires management and planning among suppliers of equipment and potential users.
The share of variable renewables in total power generation increases to 15% in REmap 2030. According to 
the local power industry estimates, there is a potential 
to cover 6 GW of variable renewables with dispatch 
capacity, which is lower than the 20 GW capacity estimated in REmap 2030. It will be necessary to plan 
for the potential growth in variable renewables as part 
of the modernization of the transmission and grid 
infrastructure. Replacement of the aging power plant 
capacity in the short-term also offers an important opportunity as new capacity can be designed by considering the need for flexibility to maintain a higher share of 
variable renewables in the power system. Additionally, plants close to supply areas will be priority, utilising the 
biomass supply potential will still require transport infrastructure to ensure supply meets demand in heating, 
power generation and biofuel production plants that are 
mainly in central and eastern parts of Ukraine. This is a 
major barrier to exploit Ukraine’s forestry for the heating 
and power generation sectors. For cost-effective supply of biomass, existing road and rail infrastructure will 
require improvements.
The use of straw is hindered by significant collection 
cost, and the fact that most agricultural enterprises lack 
the ability to collect, bundle and adequately store straw.
There is no wholesale market for biomass products and 
the practice of agreeing to long-term biomass supply 
contracts between producers and consumers is not 
yet established. Pre-commercialization costs are high 
which limits reaching economies of scale. There is also 
an untapped potential to improve agricultural yields.
Wheat yields in Ukraine are 2.7 tonnes per hectare today, compared to the world average of 2.86 tonnes and 
Western Europe average of 8 tonnes per hectare. Thus 
far, limited improvement has been observed in Ukraine’s 
agricultural yields. Closing this yield gap will be important to make land available for energy crop production 
(van der Hilst et al. 2013).
Another important issue is land use and land ownership. During the land reform, land was distributed to the 
workers of the collective and state farms. Today, most 
landowners lease their land. This has led to the rise of 
agriculture holdings which are increasingly accounting 
for a larger share of land ownership, and potentially having more power in controlling and decision making for 
Ukraine’s land use and agriculture sector (Plank, 2013).
New policies to increase energy crop and agricultural 
residues supply would need to be formulated carefully 
to ensure sustainability by considering the specific characteristics of the Ukrainian land ownership.
Based on the NREAP and Ukraine’s Energy Strategy, this 
study assumes that the total final energy demand will 
grow at moderate rates of about 1.3% per year as opposed to today’s trends where total demand decreases.
If the future demand follows today’s developments, 
there could be two implications on the total renewable 
energy use and shares. The first implication could be 
that the total renewable energy use may also grow at 
slower rates by following the total demand. This because the need for new capacity is lower, which may 
reduce the future renewable energy shares. The second 
implication is when the absolute renewable energy use 
grows identical to what is envisioned by Ukraine’s government plans. Compared to lower total final energy 
demand, this would cover a higher share and would 
raise the total renewable energy share as opposed to 
what has been estimated in this study.
.Based on the findings of this analysis, and the above 
discussion of barriers to renewable energy deployment 
in Ukraine, these suggestions are proposed to accelerate 
the uptake of renewable energy in Ukraine:
l Modernise and improve the efficiency of the existing power generation and heating capacities 
with new investments for energy efficiency and 
renewables
l Complement and improve energy efficiency and 
security by diversifying natural gas imports and 
increasing production of indigenous natural gas
l Increase investments both domestic and foreign 
in new capacity by easing the procedure to qualify for green tariffs, by developing incentives for 
small-scale investors, and by creating financing 
through affordable loan products such as loan 
guarantees
l Add knowledge on resource potential and the 
cost and benefits of renewables, and develop 
norms, rules, standards and definitions
l Utilise local manufacturing capacity to create an 
affordable market for renewable energy equipment
l Develop a national transmission and distribution 
grid plan that considers more than a 15% share 
of generation from wind and solar, and consider 
flexibility in newly constructed thermal power 
plants
l Develop collection systems for agricultural residues and invest in infrastructure for the sustainable recovery of forest biomassAEA Technology Environment (2005), Damages per

(USD/GJ) Comments and sources
Coal 3.0
Steam coal prices for 2010 was assumed as USD 2.7 per GJ in 
Ukraine in 2010 (EPA/GMI, 2013). According to IEA (2011), coal 
prices are projected to increase by about 10% between 2010 and 
2030.
Natural gas (household) 4.6 According to the IEA (2012b), household natural gas prices were 
USD 2-3 per GJ, industry natural gas prices were USD 9 per 
GJ, and district heating natural prices were USD 4-5 per GJ (all 
including value added tax). Import prices of natural gas were 
slightly lower than the industry natural gas prices, but there is an 
overall relationship between the natural gas price developments 
for all sectors and import prices. Based on the European natural 
gas import price growth estimates according to the IEA (2011) of 
55% between 2010 and 2030, the 2030 prices are estimated.

price increase as gasoline. Advanced bioethanol is assumed to 
have a 20% reduction in production price over current best practice assumptions. Normal fuel taxes in line with those for gasoline 
are assumed.
Diesel 39 According to the GIZ (2012), diesel price in Ukraine was USD 0.92 
per liter.
Biodiesel 39 Same as biodiesel

country meeting in Kiev on March 12, 2015. The meeting 
took place at the premises of the Institute for Renewable Energy, National Academy of Sciences. The meeting was attended by about 25 participants representing 
the following organizations:
1. International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)
2. Ministry for Regional Development, Building and 
Housing of Ukraine
3. Ministry of Energy and Coal Industry of Ukraine
4. Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food
5. State Agency on Energy Efficiency and Energy 
Saving of Ukraine (SAEE)
6. Ukrainian Wind Energy Association
7. Bioenergy Association of Ukraine
8. Association of Renewable Electricity
9. Association of Alternative Fuels and Renewable 
Energy of Ukraine
10. Institute for Renewable Energy, National 
Academy of Sciences
11. UNIDO/GEF
12. GIZ Ukraine
The aim of this official meeting was to present the final 
version REmap Ukraine background paper to Ukraine 
policy makers and the renewable energy industry associations. The final version of the report was released 
for feedback and comments to participants one week 
in advance, in order to take any final feedback into 
account.
The meeting started with the introduction of the SAEE 
and the National Academy of Sciences (hosting the 
meeting and closely working the SAEE in energy 
issues). The introduction was followed by two IRENA 
presentations. IRENA presented its overall structure, 
and the various thematic areas of work, including 
the REmap project. The second IRENA presentation 
focused on the detailed results of REmap Ukraine.
Several participants provided feedback to the analysis 
during the meeting.
Summary of the feedback received
l Clarify whether there is a pessimistic and an

optimistic scenario of renewable energy use in 
Ukraine in REmap 2030;
Discuss the results by elaborating on the 
issues that are being faced in Ukraine today� 
Three main issues relating to renewable energy 
were mentioned: i) investment uncertainty
related to the current political situation in 
Ukraine, which result in high interest rates, 
ii) regional diversity of RE resource potential, 
iii) instability in Ukraine’s renewable energy 
policies;
This is the first study where biomass use is assessed at the level of all sectors, which also 
shows that biomass can contribute to large share 
of Ukraine’s total final energy consumption; The 
growth in total final energy consumption 
between 2010 and 2030 may not be realistic in 
view of the historical trends� No growth in TFEC 
between 2013 and 2030 is more realistic;
By 2030, a 20% share of biomass use in the heating sector is realistic, which is slightly lower than 
the estimates of REmap 2030 of approximately 
25%;
At least 60% share of biomass supply is expected to be from energy crops and agricultural 
residues, which is in line with REmap estimates 
(70-90%);
There is a potential to cover 6 GW of variable 
renewables with dispatch capacity� It may not be 
possible, for the 20 GW capacity estimated in 
REmap;
National Academy of Sciences has estimated the 
potential of renewables for the power and 
heating sectors for the years 2030 and 2035� According to these estimates, wind power capacity 
reaches 10 GW by 2030, and 16 GW by 2035 (in 
both years 3000 full load hours per years)� For 
solar PV, total installed capacity reaches 4 GW by 
2030, and 8 GW by 2035� Renewable energy

share in power generation reaches 22% in 2030 
and 28% in 2035� Biomass heat reaches 10 Mtoe 
per year, and a total of 1�6 GW biomass power 
generation capacity can be installed by 2030;
There is a working group established for the development of the power industry and the transmission and grids with a long-term focus� The 
aim is to identify how much renewable power 
can be added to the grid;
In such analysis, it is necessary to cover all types 
of renewable energy sources, not only biomass 
or wind, so REmap approach makes an important 
step forward;
l With the support of IRENA, action is needed in 
Ukraine for renewable energy deployment at 
both national and international levels. National 
and international efforts need to be done in parallel. REmap Ukraine study is a good basis for action for communication with the government as 
well as the fossil fuel and nuclear power lobbies.P.O. Box 236, Abu Dhabi
