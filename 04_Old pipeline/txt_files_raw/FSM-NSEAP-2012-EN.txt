Objective 4: Capacity Building ......................................................................................................................................................................................................... 85The National Energy Policy has as primary goal to have the Nation becoming less dependent on imported fossil fuels by
implementing energy efficiency and conservation measurements and including more environmentally sound renewable energy
sources that are locally available. To reach this goal the Government carries the following Vision, Objective and Major Goal:
 The National Vision statement for Energy is:
To improve the life and livelihood of all FSM citizens with affordable, reliable and environmentally sound energy.
 The National Objective for Energy is:
To promote the sustainable socio-economic development of FSM through the provision and utilization of cost-effective, safe, reliable and
sustainable energy services.
Whereas energy services refer to work relating to the sale, supply, storage and distribution of energy.
 The Major Goal of the Policy is:
To become less dependent on imported sources of energy by having an increased share of renewable energy sources and having cross- sectoral energy conservation and efficiency standards in place; and therefore,
By 2020 the share of renewable energy sources will be at least 30% of total energy production, while energy efficiency will increase by 50%.
Energy Efficiency referred here would also mean reduction of energy loss.by the energy division, which works closely together with the energy sector in the four FSM states. Additionally, the National
Government has prepared their own energy action plans that when combined with the various states action plans will delineate a
road map that will assist the nation in achieving its goals and objectives.
The Government would like to emphasize a collaborative effort towards the bulk purchase of fuel. An important and recent
achievement that contributes to a stable economy and supports the energy sector as a whole is the establishment of FSM
Petroleum Corporation. Initiating bulk purchases will inherently contribute to improve cost efficiency. Another important initiative is to improve sea vessel schedules to maximize the efficiency of the missions and to enable the various
departments and offices to coordinate activities and services. The aim is to have the shipping schedules available on-line and
regularly updated so that a wider public audience can be reached. A recent example of improving this communication method was the installation of VSATs, which connected various outer islands to
the internet. This important development will increase the use of sea transportation as the outer island communities can schedule
their activities following the arrival of the sea vessels. This communication not only generates income, but will improve the
exchange of goods from various communities to the urban centers, as well as contribute to the potential of converting coconut oil
to biodiesel.
The energy action plans will lay the foundation for the FSM to achieve its goal, to become less dependent upon imported fossil fuel
base-energy, that will ‘set the bar’ of sustainability as a model to follow.The national action plans can be split up into four major groups:
I. Energy Efficient Appliances
II. Energy Conservation (including renewable energy sources)
III. Energy Awareness Campaign
IV. Nationwide Energy Programs:
 Training & Capacity Building
 Energy Related Studies
 Development of a Centralized Energy Database
 Donor and Development Support Coordination
Grid connected solar PV systems on Airport building, Kosrae Public bodies are required to purchase only energy efficient lighting from fiscal year 2011 forward
 Replace or install Energy Star rated lighting in national government buildings
Lighting accounts for a significant proportion of electricity use in the public sector. Most of the lights used in the offices are inefficient 40 W T12
fluorescent lights. Modern LED bulbs and luminaries provide an immediate opportunity for significant energy efficiency improvement. The
National Government has committed to the use of more efficient lighting (wherever feasible) and to replace incandescent light bulbs in public
buildings with modern Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) or other energy efficient lights such as LED’s.
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of TC&I in coordination with Department of R&D (energy division)
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 50,000
 All the street and security lights in National Government facilities will have to be energy efficient
There are over 10 street lights and approximately 30 security lights using (SOX 116 W light bulbs) installed in National Government facilities, representing a significant energy load. Instituting a program to replace these street and security lights will be developed by the Department of
R&D, TC&I, PUC and local authorities. Most of the security lights are on 24 hours a day due to bad functioning sensors. The national
government will appoint a maintenance officer that will be responsible for making sure that the lights are off during day time.
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of R&D in coordination with Department of TC&I
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 30,000 All air conditioning systems will be required to be regularly inspected by trained experts to ensure that they operate to maximum
energy efficiency.  The room or office temperature should be no less than 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24o C)
From July 2011, any air conditioning system with a total capacity of 6 kWh will be advised to have the system inspected by a trained inspector in
order to ensure efficient energy usage by the system.
The National Government will start this initiative by having all their air conditioning systems inspected and certified. A manual will have to be
prepared to standardize a national methodology for inspections, and assist owners in fulfilling their responsibilities.
This manual will detail how and when inspections are to be carried out.
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of TC&I and the department of R&D
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 30,000 The national government will strongly support and adopt the Energy Star initiative in FSM to promote energy efficiency in office
equipment
The EU has entered into an agreement with the Government of the United States of America on the coordination of energy-efficient labeling
programs for office equipment under the Energy Star program.
The program initiated by the US Environmental Protection Agency, has now matured into a worldwide energy efficiency program, run in
partnership by the US EPA, the European Union, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Canada, to promote energy-efficient office
equipment on a worldwide level. FSM is willing to follow the EU and US in adopting the Energy Star initiative.
The promotion of the use of Energy Star certified appliances in the FSM will lead to significant cost cutting measures, thereby saving up to 50%
in energy usage. This can be accomplished through the replacement of current equipment with Energy Star certified appliances.
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of R&D – trade division with support of the energy division
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 10,000 National Government agencies are required to procure energy-efficient products. R&D will produce purchasing specifications to
help National Government comply with these procurement requirements.
The Specifications for energy-efficient products will include:
 National Government Requirements: Draft an outline of National laws and regulations surrounding the purchase and use of energy
efficient products.
 Purchasing Specifications: Provide energy performance requirements for energy-efficient products by category.
 Energy Cost Calculators: Provide tools to calculate projected energy savings by switching to more efficient products.
 Standby Power Data Center: Outline products with low standby power, including office equipment, consumer electronics, appliances,
and many other categories.
The US Department of Energy‘s “Federal Energy Management Program” can be used as guidelines.
(http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/technologies/eep.fedrequirements.html )
Benefits
The National Government is the largest volume buyer of energy-consuming products in the FSM. By procuring energy-efficient products, buyers
can reduce energy consumption and achieve enormous cost savings. The aggregate effect of these purchasing decisions is enormous.
By setting a clear standard for energy performance, Federal procurement requirements can shift the market toward greater supply of energy- efficient products in FSM. That, in turn, improves availability and reduces cost for all consumers.
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of R&D with support of the Department of TC&I and Justice
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 50,000 An energy rating system for public buildings will be developed and used starting in 2011
 Initiate an Energy Rating system for Government office buildings  Develop a Building Energy Performance Directive
In order to meet the Building Energy Performance Directive, all new offices/structures will be required to have their energy efficiency assessed
and certified by an expert. This energy assessment will be extended to existing national government buildings. A Building Energy Rating ‘table’
will be developed and will provide information on the building’s energy use. This table can be used to demonstrate improvements over time, while all national government buildings will be required to display their rating. Additionally, this will encourage transparency of energy
performance by the building tenant.
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of R&D with support of the Department of TC&I, and all public sector organizations.
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 20,000 Developers of any new government building must perform an energy efficiency feasibility assessment while incorporating
renewable energy resources for that structure
Prior the construction and/or refurbishment of a new building with a floor area exceeding 2,500 ft2, a due diligence regarding the technical,
environmental and economic feasibility impact studies of installing renewable energy systems in the proposed building will be required
This action should significantly increase interest and awareness of alternative energy options.
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of TC&I with support of the Department of R&D
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 10,000 The Government will encourage developers to adopt a set of energy standards well above those prescribed by law within the
code of building regulations
Building codes and energy standards are currently available in the FSM and follow US building codes. More recent codes were developed and
implemented in Hawaii and Guam. These codes could be used as example and adapted in the FSM. Recent and newly constructed buildings
have included energy efficiency measures have been implemented to some extent; however, by putting forth a building code standard model,
developers will have an easier guide to follow.
The standardization of new construction or retro-fit projects will prepare the market for the revision of the existing Building Regulations and
create movement towards a requirement of 40% improvement in the energy performance of new houses/ buildings compared to the current
standard. A program must be implemented, offering support to developers to build both residential and commercial buildings with an energy
performance standard of at least 60% above that required in the current Building Regulations.
This action will demonstrate the opportunities for a strong shift towards low carbon output and energy efficient housing in FSM.
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of TC&I with support of the Department of R&D
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 30,000 Set-up an information desk and website that supports the networking and exchange of best energy efficiency practices by the
energy users through the Association of Micronesian Utilities (AMU)
AMU’s secretariat is temporarily housed in R&D. They will establish and administer the program for energy users. AMU, in operation for more
than 2 years, already engaged the 4 FSM utilities that are the main suppliers of electricity in FSM.
The aim is for AMU is to utilize their energy experts to assist the utilities with their ongoing site visits to customers, holding workshops on
energy efficiency and annual performance reporting. AMU members share information on energy saving technologies and techniques to
maximize savings and maintain competitiveness.
The National Government will continue to work with AMU to improve networking and information exchange opportunities. The emphasis will
be on continued implementation of efficiency programs and measures.  Develop an Energy Management Action Plan
 Assist the private sector to improve their energy management through the Energy MAP initiative
The Energy MAP (Energy Management Action Plan) will be designed to target and engage the private sector to practice energy management by
maximizing their renewable energy usage. The concept is centered on a website that provides advice, training, interactive energy efficiency
opportunities and potential funding assistance. In conjunction with the College of Micronesia and AMU, training courses will be available that
offer introductory workshops/classes for energy management. These courses are tailored for specific groups or sectors, and include on-site
assessments for participating firms. The Energy MAP website resource will be designed as a toolkit for NSA and SMEs on both the managerial
and technical aspects of energy efficiency. AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of R&D and AMU with support from SPC
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 100,000 The target of this campaign will be the National Government employees, through the “Save and Gain Campaign” initiative,
a new element of the National Energy Efficiency Campaign, to promote an understanding of the need for efficient energy use in
the workplace
The “Save and Gain” campaign, will work in tandem with the EDF-10 awareness campaign. The campaign will deliver the message of energy
efficiency and conservation to households of government employees instituting an awareness and understanding that together, we can have a
positive impact on energy efficiency. This particular group will set an example within the community to adapt to renewable resources whether
it’s implemented in offices, shops, homes and other locations. It will empower committed individual employees to change their own behavior
and encourage their colleagues to do the same. The messages will focus on what each individual can do, including switching off equipment
when not in use, and turning off lights whenever possible. It will emphasize the importance of such individual behavior, coming together as a
whole, while encouraging the government to engage strategically in energy efficiency.
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of R&D with the PIO
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 50,000 This will address the need for efficient energy use in the home through the National Energy Efficiency Awareness Campaign - Power for All.
During the REP-5 program an awareness campaign was started and achieved significant benchmarks in terms of awareness about renewable
energy and energy efficiency. It delivered the message of the importance of energy efficiency to all consumers and also offered them initial and
simple basic steps in improving their way of using energy through small changes in behavior and choices. These messages have been delivered
through sports events, workshops, web and print, as well through online communities and social networks.
The campaign’s messages will be strengthened in the future and thus will offer advancement opportunities to homeowners and motivating
change in the private and public sectors.
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of R&D with AMU
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 50,000 To provide support to the four FSM states by initiating, funding and conducting nation-wide energy studies that can lead to
energy enhanced projects
The four FSM States have common energy needs and face the same challenges. After evaluating the energy action plan, it was clear that there
are commonalities amongst the states. Rather than focusing on performing a certain study for just one state, the studies can be conducted in all
of the states under one contract, otherwise the smaller states will be left behind. Studies that could be done on a nation-wide scale are but not limited to:
 Wind studies (inclusive of wind mapping)
 Waste characterization study and Waste-to-Energy feasibility study
 Wave and Ocean Energy Technology
 Bio fuel including Bio diesel using coconut oil feasibility study
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of R&D in cooperation with AMU
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 250,000 Start a capacity building program that will serve the four FSM States
Over the years many energy initiatives are being realized in the four FSM states. ‘Capacity building’ was in most cases part of the programs and
built on a project base structure. The four FSM states have set forth ‘capacity building’ as a priority and the National Government has seen the
importance of a more structured and regulated program that would build on the existing programs, ultimately increase the participants
knowledge with international recognition. The areas of training workshops to be held are:
Module 1:  PV Grid connected systems  PV off grid systems
Module 2:  Energy Efficiency  Energy Auditing
Module 3:  General Renewable Energy, e.g. hydro, wave, tide, etc.  Biomass  Wind data analyzing and other wind related studies  Workshops related coconut oil and Bio-fuels  Workshops on Biogas
Module 4:  DSM and Utility SSM training
The trainings/workshops will be conducted at least one module to be done a year. The College of Micronesia will host the training sessions and
will be the recipient of the developed curriculum. This activity will support the establishment of the Centre of National Resources and Energy
within the COM.
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION:
Department of R&D in cooperation with AMU and COM
ESTIMATED BUDGET:
$ 500,000 As part of the Nationwide Energy Sector a centralized energy database will be developed and managed by the Department of
Resources and Development - Energy Division
As of 2011, the four FSM States have their own electricity sector organized with a state utility as the electricity provider. A nationwide operating
petroleum corporation (FSM PC) was being established in 2008 as the sole petroleum based fuel provider. Furthermore, there are some private
companies who are currently selling propane gas and PV solar systems. In order to monitor the development of the energy sector, and to
improve joint efforts that will bring FSM closer to achieving its goals set in this policy, it is crucial to set up and maintain this a centralized
energy database, which will help in monitoring the current situation and its evolution over time. The database will correlate with the sub- regional and regional energy database and serve as a source of information for the energy sector.
