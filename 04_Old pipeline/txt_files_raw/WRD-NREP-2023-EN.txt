FEI Facility for Energy InclusionGlobal investment in technologies related to the energy transition, 
including for energy efficiency, reached USD1.3 trillion in 2022 - a 
new record-high. Nonetheless, annual investments need to at least 
quadruple to remain on track to achieve the 1.5°C Scenario laid out in 
IRENA’s World energy transitions outlook 2022. 
Ongoing global crises present both a challenge and an opportunity 
for the accelerated deployment of renewable energy. The tighter 
fiscal space and uncertain macroeconomic outlook are negatively 
impacting flows of investment towards renewables, while the present 
energy crisis is forcing countries to urgently deploy alternative sources 
of energy that are sustainable, reliable and affordable. Meanwhile, 
733 million people had no access to electricity and nearly 2.4 billion 
people relied on traditional fuels and technologies for cooking at the 
end of 2020.
While global investment in renewable energy, specifically, reached 
a record high in 2022 - at USD0.5 trillion - it represented less than 
one-third of the average investment needed each year between 2021 
and 2030 according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Investments are also 
not flowing at the pace or scale needed to achieve the improvements 
in livelihoods and welfare called for under the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development. For example, investments in off-grid 
renewable energy solutions in 2021 - at USD 0.5 billion - fell far short 
of the USD2.3 billion needed annually in off-grid solar products alone 
between 2021 and 2030 to accelerate progress towards universal 
energy access.
Moreover, investments have become further concentrated in specific 
technologies and uses, and in a small number of countries/regions. In 
2020, solar photovoltaic alone attracted 43% of the total investment 
in renewables, followed by onshore and offshore wind (at 35% and 
12%, respectively). To best support the energy transition, more funds 
need to flow to less mature technologies and to sectors beyond power 
(e.g. heating and cooling, transport, energy efficiency and system

Energy AgencyMore importantly, more than 50% of the worlds population, mostly residing in developing and 
emerging countries, received only 15% of global investments in 2022. Sub-Saharan Africa, for 
example, received less than 1.5% of the amount invested globally between 2000 and 2020. The 
disparity in renewable energy financing received by developed versus developing countries has 
increased significantly over the past six years. For example, the renewable energy investment 
per capita in Europe and North America (excluding Mexico) was almost 23 times higher than 
that in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2015. In 2021, investment per capita in Europe was 41 times that in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, and in North America it was 57 times more. 
For the energy transition to have a positive impact, governments and development partners 
need to play a more active role in ensuring a more equitable flow of finance that recognises the 
different endowments and starting conditions of countries. This report underscores the need to 
direct public funds to regions and countries that have considerable untapped potential but find 
it difficult to attract investment. These funds should be directed to support energy transition 
infrastructure development, and enabling policy frameworks to drive investment and address 
persistent socio-economic gaps.
Achieving an energy transition in line with the 1.5°C Scenario requires the redirection of 
USD1trillion per year from fossil fuels to energy-transition-related technologies; but following a 
brief decline in 2020 due to COVID-19, fossil fuel investments are on the rise. In addition, the fossil 
fuel industry continues to receive considerable support through subsidies. Subsidies doubled in 
2021 across 51 countries, with consumption subsidies expected to have risen even further in 2022 
due to contemporaneous price pressures. The phasing out of investments in fossil fuel assets 
should be coupled with the elimination of subsidies to level the playing field with renewables. 
However, the reduction of subsidies needs to be accompanied by a robust safety net to ensure 
adequate standards of living for vulnerable populations.
This report emphasises how lending to developing countries seeking to deploy renewables must 
be reformed. The analysis highlights the limitations of using public funds mainly for de-risking 
investments and emphasises the need for a much stronger role for public financing. Recognising 
the limited public funds available in the developing world, the need for stronger international 
collaboration to achieve a substantial increase in financial flows from the Global North to the 
Global South is highlighted. The report also discusses the different sources, intermediaries and 
policy instruments that can channel public financing into the energy sector and the broader 
economy to support a just and inclusive transition.Global investments in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022, a record 
high. Yet, the current pace of investment is not sufficient to put the world on track towards 
meeting climate or socio-economic development goals. 
In 2022, global investments in energy transition technologies – renewable energy, energy 
efficiency, electrified transport and heat, energy storage, hydrogen and carbon capture and 
storage (CCS) – reached USD 1.3 trillion despite the prevailing macroeconomic, geopolitical and 
supply chain challenges. Global investments were up 19% from 2021 levels, and almost 70% from 
2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure S.1). This trend demonstrates a growing recognition 
of the climate crisis and energy security risks associated with over-reliance on fossil fuels. 
Yet, the current pace of investment is not sufficient; annual investments need to at least quadruple. 
Keeping the world on track to achieving the energy transition in line with the 1.5°C Scenario laid 
out in IRENA’s World energy transitions outlook 2023 will require annual investments of more than 
USD 5 trillion on average between 2023 and 2030 (IRENA, 2023a).

Notes: Renewable energy investments for 2021 and 2022 represent preliminary estimates based on data from Bloomberg New 
Energy Finance (BNEF). As BNEF has limited coverage of large hydropower investments, these were estimated at USD 7 billion per 
year, the annual average investment in 2019 and 2020. Energy efficiency data are from IEA (2022a). These values are in constant 
2019 dollars, while all other values are at current prices and exchange rates. Due to the lack of more granular data, the units could 
not be harmonised across the databases. For this reason, these numbers are presented together for indicative purposes only and 
should not be used to make comparisons between data sources. Data for other energy transition technologies come from BNEF

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Achieving an energy transition in line with the 1.5°C Scenario requires the redirection of 
USD 1 trillion per year from fossil fuels to energy-transition-related technologies; but fossil fuel 
investments are still on the rise. 
Fossil fuel investments had declined in 2020 (down 22% from the USD 1 trillion invested in 2019) 
mainly due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on global energy markets (IEA, 2022c). 
Nevertheless, 2021 saw fossil fuel investments bounce back up 15% to USD 897 billion (Figure S.2), 
and preliminary data for 2022 suggest they might have almost returned to their pre-pandemic 
levels (+6%), reaching USD 953 billion (IEA, 2022c). 
Investment in energy is still going into funding new oil and gas fields instead of renewables and 
it is estimated that USD 570 billion will be spent on new oil and gas development and exploration 
every year until 2030 (IISD, 2022). 
Investors and banks have already committed to financing fossil fuel development over and above 
the limit needed to meet the 1.5°C target. Over the six years following the Paris Climate Agreement, 
some large multi-national banks maintained and even increased their investments in fossil fuels at 
an average of about USD 750 billion dollars per year (Environmental Finance, 2022a). The world’s 
60 largest commercial banks invested around USD 4.6 trillion in fossil fuels between 2015 and 
2021, more than one-quarter of which came from US banks (Environmental Finance, 2022a).

Figure S.2 Annual investment in renewable energy vs. fossil fuels, 2015-2022 
Note: FF = fossil fuel; RE = renewable energy. 
Based on: CPI (2022a) and IEA (2022b).Fossil fuel companies based in emerging markets and developing economies have continued 
to attract substantial volumes of financing. Between 2016 and 2022, their outstanding debt 
rose by 400% for coal and 225% for oil and gas, despite the need to align investments with the 
goals outlined in the Paris Agreement (IMF, 2022a). In Africa, capital expenditures for oil and 
gas exploration rose from USD 3.4 billion in 2020 to USD 5.1 billion in 2022. African companies 
accounted for less than one-third of this sum. 
In addition to direct investments in assets, the fossil fuel industry continues to receive considerable 
support through subsidies. Between 2013 and 2020, USD 2.9 trillion was spent globally on fossil 
fuel subsidies (Fossil Fuels Subsidy Tracker, 2022). In 2020, Europe was the region providing the 
most subsidies, having overtaken the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) (Figure S.3). On a per 
capita basis, fossil fuel subsidies in Europe totalled USD 113 per person, more than triple those in 
MENA (USD 36 per person). However, fossil fuel subsidies in MENA make up 1.56% of the gross 
domestic product (GDP) while in Europe, they constitute only 0.3% of GDP.

Figure S.3 Annual fossil fuel subsidies by region, 2013-2020
Source: Fossil Fuels Subsidy Tracker (2022). Subsidies doubled in 2021 across 51 countries, from USD 362 billion in 2020 to USD 697 billion, 
with consumption subsidies expected to have risen even further in 2022 due to contemporaneous 
price pressures (OECD and IEA, 2022). The phasing out of investments in fossil fuel assets should 
be coupled with the elimination of subsidies to ensure that the full costs of fossil fuels are reflected 
in their price and to level the playing field with renewables and other energy-transition-related 
technologies. However, the phaseout of subsidies needs to be accompanied by a proper safety 
net to ensure adequate standards of living for vulnerable populations (IRENA, 2022a). 
Investments in renewable energy continue to grow, but not at the pace needed to achieve 
climate, energy access and energy security objectives along with other socio-economic 
development goals by 2030. 
Despite multiple economic, social and geopolitical challenges, annual investments in renewable 
energy continued a positive trend that began after 2018 (see Figure S.4). Preliminary data suggest 
that in 2021, investments reached USD 430 billion (24% up from 2020) and in 2022 they further 
increased by 16% reaching almost USD 0.5 trillion (BNEF, 2023b).1
 Yet, investment in 2022 was 
less than one-third of the average investment needed each year between 2023 and 2030 (about 
USD 1.6 trillion in renewable power and the direct use of renewables) according to IRENA’s 1.5°C 
Scenario (IRENA, 2023a).

Source: CPI (2022a). Investments for 2021 and 2022 are preliminary estimates based on data from BNEF (2023b). As BNEF data

average investment for the preceding two years.
1 These figures represent “primary” financial transactions in both large- and small-scale projects that directly contribute to 
deployment of renewable energy, and therefore exclude secondary transactions, e.g. refinancing of existing debts or public trading 
in financial markets. Note that this is different from investments discussed in Chapter 3 for the off-grid renewable energy sector 
which relates to corporate-level transactions (both primary and secondary) and is therefore different from investments discussed in 
Chapter 2 (although some overlap is possible). For more details, please see the methodology document (Appendix). As previously Investments are also not flowing at the pace or scale needed to achieve the improvements in 
livelihoods and welfare envisioned in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Despite 
progress in energy access, approximately 733 million people had no access to electricity and 
nearly 2.4  billion people relied on traditional fuels and technologies for cooking at the end 
of 2020 (IEA, IRENA, et al. 2022). Between 2010 and 2021, the off-grid renewables sector 
attracted more than USD 3 billion (Wood Mackenzie, 2022a). Investments in off-grid solutions 
reached USD  558  million in 2021, a 27% increase from 2020 (Figure S.5). But this amount is 
far short of the USD 2.3 billion needed annually in off-grid solar products alone (not including 
mini-grids) between 2021 and 2030 to accelerate progress towards universal energy access 
(ESMAP et al. 2022a).2
Although on the rise, off-grid investments are concentrated among seven large incumbent 
companies that have already reached scale and are looking to further solidify their market position 
through their ability to attract capital. The average transaction size climbed from USD 1.1 million 
in 2017 to 1.7 million by 2020, before more than doubling to USD 3.7 million in 2021 (Figure S.5). 
While a trend of growing ticket size is a sign of sector growth and maturity, it may also indicate 
existing challenges for enterprises looking for smaller investments. Overall investments USD million (constant 2020)

Investments have become further concentrated in specific technologies and uses. To best 
support the energy transition, more funds need to flow to less mature technologies and to 
sectors beyond power. 
While annual renewable energy investments have been growing over time, these have been 
concentrated in the power sector. Between 2013 and 2020, power generation assets attracted, 
on average, 90% of renewable investments each year, and up to 97% in 2021 and 2022.Solar and wind technologies consistently attract the largest share of investment by a wide 
margin. In 2020, solar photovoltaic (PV) alone attracted 43% of the total, followed by onshore 
and offshore wind (at 35% and 12%, respectively). 
Investments in end uses, i.e. direct applications, which include heat generation (e.g. solar water 
heaters, geothermal heat pumps, biomass boilers) and transport (e.g. biofuels) are lagging; they 
will need to increase from USD 13 billion in 2022 to an average USD 269 billion each year between 
now and 2030 (IRENA, 2023a).
In the off-grid space, solar PV products also dominate, attracting 92% of overall investments in
2010-2021, owing chiefly to their modular and distributed characteristics, and their adaptability to a 
wide variety of applications. Solar home systems (SHSs) are the most funded technology (Figure S.6). 
Even though the majority of off-grid investments went to residential applications between 2010 and 
2021, the share going to commercial and industrial (C&I) applications has been expanding over time 
(from 8% in 2015 to 32% in 2021) as consumer needs grow beyond basic household access to more 
energy-intensive uses in local industry and agriculture. Powering C&I applications can promote local 
economies by creating jobs and spurring economic growth, while also enhancing food security and 
resilience against the impacts of climate variability on agri-food chains (IRENA, 2016b). USD million (constant 2020)

Figure S.6 Annual investment in off-grid renewable energy, by off-grid product, and energy use, 2010-2021
Based on: Wood Mackenzie (2022a)Investments are increasingly focused in a number of regions and countries. They need to be 
more universal for a more inclusive energy transition. 
Although renewable energy investments are on the rise globally, they continue to be focused 
in a number of countries and regions. The East Asia and Pacific region continues to attract the 
majority of investment – two-thirds of the global total in 2022 (Figure S.7) – primarily led by 
China. A suite of policies including tax exemptions have driven investments in solar and wind 
in China, putting the country on track to meeting the targets set out in the 14th Five-Year Plan 
(Carbon Brief, 2021). Viet Nam saw investment in solar PV grow by an average of 219% per year 
between 2013 and 2020, driven mainly by feed-in tariffs (Lorimer, 2021). North America excluding 
Mexico attracted the second-largest share of investment in 2022, mainly driven by the production 
tax credit in the United States, followed by Europe, where net-zero commitments and extensive 
policies to phase out fossil fuels are driving growth in renewables. 
In the United States, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act – encompassing new tax credits, 
USD 30 billion in grants and loans for clean energy generation and storage, and USD 60 billion 
in support of manufacturing of low-carbon components – is expected to attract USD 114 billion 
investment by 2031. In Europe, the European Commission presented a Green Deal Industrial Plan 
for the Net-Zero Age, which would provide investment aid and tax breaks towards technological 
development, manufacturing, production and installation of net-zero products in green sectors 
including renewables and hydrogen (Bloomberg, 2023; European Commission, 2023). The plan 
looks to mobilise EUR 225 billion in loans from its existing Recovery and Resilience Facility, and 
an additional EUR 20 billion in grants (European Commission, 2023).

analysis, please see methodology document (Appendix).
Source: CPI (2022a)Regions home to about 120 developing and emerging markets continue to receive comparatively 
low investment. Across these regions, the bulk of renewable energy investments is captured by 
a handful of countries: Brazil, Chile and India. In other words, more than 50% of the world’s 
population, mostly residing in developing and emerging countries, received only 15% of global 
investments in renewables in 2022. Further, the share of renewable energy investments going to 
these regions has been progressively declining year on year (e.g. from 27% in 2017 to 15% in 2022).
In absolute terms, annual investments have been declining precipitously since 2018 at an average 
rate of 36%. Countries defined as “least developed” by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change attracted only 0.84% of renewable energy investments on average between 2013
and 2020.
Looking at investments on a per capita basis further reveals the disparity in investments. 
In East Asia and Pacific, investment per capita increased by 51% between 2015 and 2021 from 
USD 70/person in 2015 to USD 105/person in 2021. The bulk of the increase took place in China, 
while Japan experienced a 45% decline over the same period. Excluding these two countries, the 
region experienced a more than 6-fold increase led by countries such as Viet Nam and Republic 
of Korea. In South Asia, investments per capita declined by 6% between 2015 and 2021, however 
the true extent of the decline is masked by India which saw investment per capita grow by 34% 
in the same period. Excluding India, investment per capita declined by 61% from USD 12/person 
in 2015 to USD 5/person in 2021. The most striking – and rapidly growing – disparity is between 
Sub-Saharan Africa and both North America (excluding Mexico) and Europe. In 2015, renewable 
energy investment per capita in North America (excluding Mexico) or Europe was almost 23 times 
higher than that of Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2021, investment per capita in Europe was 41 times that 
in Sub-Saharan Africa (which in 2021 fell to just USD 3/person from USD 6/person in 2015), and 
North America was 57 times more. 
Sub-Saharan Africa remains the primary destination for investment in off-grid renewables.
The region attracted USD 2.2 billion in 2010-2021 – more than 70% of global off-grid investments. 
Electrification rates in this region are among the lowest in the world, with 568 million people 
lacking access to electricity in 2020 (IEA, IRENA et al. 2022). Within Sub-Saharan Africa, 
East Africa – home to three of the top five recipient countries of off-grid investment (Kenya, the 
United Republic of Tanzania and Rwanda) - attracted 43% of the total. Investment in these 
destinations benefited from the existing mobile money ecosystem, which was leveraged by the 
pay-as-you-go (PAYG) business model. Approximately 78% of the total commitments in off-grid 
renewables in 2010-2021 (or USD 2.4 billion) involved the funding of companies or projects using 
PAYG, with East Africa accounting for USD 917 million. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, off-grid renewable energy investments in Southeast Asia 
declined by 98%, leaving key off-grid markets even more vulnerable. Although the majority of 
countries in the region have achieved high or near-universal rates of electricity access, parts of 
the populations in countries such as Myanmar and Cambodia (26% and 15%, respectively in 2020) 
still lack access to electricity (World Bank, 2022). Whereas the region attracted USD 137 million 
in off-grid renewable energy investments over 2018-2019 (led primarily by Myanmar), during 
2020-2021, investments plummeted to USD3million, likely due to the impacts of the COVID-19 Investments have been primarily made by private actors. Private capital flows to the technologies 
and countries with the least risks – real or perceived. 
The private sector provides the lion’s share of global investments in renewable energy, committing 
around 75% of the total in the period 2013-2020 (Figure S.8). The share of public versus private 
investments varies by context and technology. Typically, lower shares of public finance are 
devoted to renewable energy technologies that are commercially viable and highly competitive, 
which makes them attractive for private investors. For example, in 2020, 83% of commitments 
in solar PV came from private finance. Meanwhile, geothermal and hydropower rely mostly on 
public finance; only 32% and 3% of investments in these technologies, respectively, came from 
private investors in 2020.

Globally, commercial financial institutions and corporations are the main private finance providers, 
accounting together for almost 85% of private finance for renewables in 2020 (Figure S.9). Up 
until 2018, private investments came predominantly from corporations (on average, 65% during 
2013-2018), but in 2019 and 2020 the share of corporations went down to 41% per year, and a 
larger share of investments was filled by commercial financial institutions (43%). This aligns with the falling share of equity financing globally, from 77% in 2013 to 43% by 2020 
(Figure S.10) as corporations together with households/individuals provided 83% of equity 
financing during 2013-2020 (Figure S.8). During this time, the share of debt financing increased 
from 23% in 2013 to 56% in 2020 (Figure S.10). This is likely linked to the maturation and 
consolidation of major renewable technologies such as solar PV and onshore wind that are able 
to attract high levels of debt, as lenders are able to envision regular and predictable cash flows 
over the long term, facilitated by power purchase agreements (PPAs) in many countries.

Figure S.10 Investment in renewable energy, by financial instrument, 2013-2020
Source: CPI (2022a)In the off-grid space, debt and equity investments contributed about 47% and 48% of the overall 
financing, respectively between 2010 and 2021, with an additional 5% contributed by grants. By 
technology, debt financing constituted the majority of the investments in solar home systems and 
solar lights (54% of the total and rising over time) while equity financing dominated the micro-/
mini-grid space. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of off-grid financing came from 
equity investments owing to the domination by private equity, venture capital and infrastructure 
funds and the lack of debt access for the sector. Ever since, the share of private equity has seen 
a relative decline (Figure S.11), in part due to the uncertainties posed by the pandemic, and the 
limited track record of exits and capital recycling in the sector. The contribution of debt has 
increased sharply over the past two years, particularly as debt-preferring DFIs bolstered their 
support during the pandemic (Figure S.14) and major off-grid companies were able to capitalise 
on their strong market position to secure (large-size) predominantly debt-based deals from both 
public and private investors (ESMAP et al. 2022b). Another remarkable trend is the increase in 
local currency debt, driven mainly by markets in Kenya and Nigeria. 
Going forward, widespread mobilisation of low-cost debt will be critical for deployment of capitalintensive renewable energy projects, while equity financing will also remain key, particularly to 
kick-start relatively less mature technologies, and finance projects in relatively high-risk or creditconstrained contexts. USD million (constant 2020)

Based on: Wood Mackenzie (2022a).The majority of public investments are made domestically with relatively little international 
collaboration. The international flow of public money to renewable energy has been in decline 
since 2018.
Public funds are limited, so governments have been focusing what is available on de-risking 
projects and improving their risk-return profiles to attract private capital.
Globally, the public sector provided less than one-third of renewable energy investment in 2020. 
State-owned financial institutions, national DFIs and state-owned enterprises were the main 
sources that year, providing more than 80% of public finance (Figure S.12). Multilateral DFIs 
provided 9% of public finance – in line with their past annual commitments – and accounted for 
about half of international flows coming from the public sector. Commitments from bilateral DFIs 
in 2020 fell 70% compared to 2019, largely due to a 96% decline in international commitments by 
the German Development Bank (KfW). This means that multilateral and bilateral DFIs provided 
less than 3% of total renewable energy investments in 2020.

In addition, financing from DFIs was provided mainly in the form of debt financing at market rates 
(requiring repayment with interest rates charged at market value). Grants and concessional loans 
amounted to just 1% of total renewable energy finance, equivalent to USD 5 billion. Since the 
interest rates are the same, the only difference that DFI financing provides is to making finance 
available, albeit at the same high costs for users. Figure S.13 illustrates the portion of DFI funding

In the off-grid space, the role of the public sector, in particular DFIs, is much more important. 
DFIs were the largest public capital providers (accounting for 79% of the public investments in 
off-grid solutions and 27% of the total investments in off-grid solutions in 2010-2021). Notably, 
DFIs’ contributions after the pandemic constitute half of their overall contributions since 2010 
(Figure S.14). 
Public finance flows to the Global South are essential to achieving the 1.5°C Scenario and its 
socio-economic benefits (together with progressive fiscal measures and other government 
programmes such as distributional policy, as outlined in IRENA [2022a]). In fact, almost 80% 
of the off-grid investments between 2010 and 2021 involved North–South flows. However, the 
international flow of public finance going to renewable energy in the broader context has been in 
decline since 2018 (IEA, IRENA et al. 2022). Preliminary data show that the downtrend continued 
through 2021.To achieve a just and inclusive energy transition, public financing – including through 
international collaboration – has a critical role to play across a broad spectrum of policies. 
Among risk mitigation instruments, sovereign guarantees have been preferred for lenders 
looking to obtain a “one-size-fits-all” solution for credit risks. But such guarantees are treated 
as contingent liabilities and may hamper a country’s ability to take on additional debt for critical 
infrastructure development and other investments (IRENA, 2020a). Moreover, sovereign debts 
are already stressed to their breaking point in many emerging economies grappling with high 
inflation and currency fluctuations or devaluations in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this 
macroeconomic environment, many countries cannot access affordable capital in international 
financial markets or provide sovereign guarantees to mitigate risk. 
Given the urgent need to step up the pace and geographic spread of the energy transition, and 
to capture its full potential in achieving socio-economic development goals, more innovative 
instruments are needed that help under-invested countries reap the long-term benefits of the 
energy transition without putting their fiscally constrained economies at a further disadvantage. USD million (constant 2020)

Note: Definitions of all investor type included in this analysis are provided in the accompanying methodology document (Appendix). 
Based on: Wood Mackenzie (2022a).Public funding must flow into the renewable energy sector (covering all segments of the value 
chain), the wider energy sector and the economy as a whole, for a just and equitable energy 
transition. Public funds can be mobilised and provided using a variety of instruments. Figure 
S.15 shows the types of instruments that can be used to channel public finance, the sources of 
public funds (domestic or international through collaboration) and the intermediaries that can 
help channel them (e.g. governments, national DFIs, local banks, multilateral and bilateral DFIs, 
export credit agencies, global funds including the Just Energy Transition Partnership [JETP] and 
UN-linked funds such as the Green Climate Fund). 
These instruments can be existing or newly designed and may include (1) government spending 
such as grants, rebates and subsidies; (2) debt including existing and new issuances, credit 
instruments, concessional financing and guarantees; (3) equity and direct ownership of assets 
(such as transmission lines or land to build projects) and (4) fiscal policy and regulations 
including taxes and levies, exemptions, accelerated depreciation, deferrals and regulations such 
as PPAs (especially when the tariffs paid to producers – in addition to the cost of running the 
system – are lower than what is collected by consumers and the difference is paid through a
government subsidy). However, such instruments should be used with caution as to not concentrate 
the benefits among a small number of players in the industry, and instruments should be designed 
in a way that distributes the benefits in an equitable and fair way.

Figure S.15 The flow of public finance for a just and inclusive energy transition1. Under deployment policies, public funds can flow as direct investments in governmentowned energy-transition-related assets, public-private partnerships, or in designing and 
funding policies that can attract or support private investment (e.g. capital subsidies, grants 
and tariff-based mechanisms such as auctions, feed-in tariffs and feed-in premiums). 
2. Under integrating policies, public investments can go into infrastructure and assets that 
support the integration of renewables into the energy system (e.g. regional and national 
transmission lines, pumped hydroelectric energy storage facilities). 
3. Under enabling policies, public money can support long-term energy planning, capacity 
building and training, research and development, the development of local industry and 
value chains, as well as technical assistance offered via multilateral development banks 
(MDBs) and inter-governmental organisations such as IRENA. 
4. Under structural change and just transition policies, public funds can go into the redesign 
of power markets to make them more conducive for large shares of variable renewable 
energy, towards compensation for the phasing-out of fossil fuels, as well as policies to 
ensure that the energy transition promotes gender equality and social inclusion, among 
many other priorities.
5. The global policy framework defines international and South-South collaboration, which is 
key to structuring and ensuring the international flows from the Global North to the Global 
South.
6. In addition, although not directly related to any specific sector, there are macroeconomic 
policies (fiscal, monetary and currency exchange policies) that affect the delivery of public 
funds towards the energy transition.
Some elements presented in the framework (Figure S.15) might overlap. For example, tax 
incentives are at the same time fiscal or macroeconomic policies while acting as deployment 
policies, and funding grid infrastructure can be viewed as an enabling or an integrating policy. 
While funding capacity building is part of an enabling policy, these funds also facilitate structural 
change, being part of social development programmes, and education, social protection and 
compensation policies, etc. Thus, there are complex inter-linkages and feedback loops between 
the different policies and instruments. By understanding the broad structural workings underlying 
the renewable energy “economy”, public policy and financing can be strategically used to advance 
the energy transition.
Governments from developed and developing countries will play a central role in providing an 
enabling environment for both public and private investments. 
A more comprehensive way of defining risk (including risk sharing) is needed. A narrow investorcentric focus on the risk of investment in energy assets not paying off needs to be broadened to 
include environmental, planetary and social risks. These include the risk of leaving a large part of the population out of the energy transition and locked in underdevelopment, and the risk of the 
Sustainable Development Goals remaining far from being met. This is how investment risks must 
be viewed from the perspective of governments and the international community. And with the 
very limited public funds available in the developing world, the international community must 
step up. 
The availability of capital for public investments in renewable energy will 
need to be increased, and lending to developing nations transformed. 
Today’s environment calls for a fundamental shift in how lending is made to developing nations, 
especially those affected by economic and climate crises, and particularly how countries in the 
Global North support countries in the Global South to cope with and adapt to crises related 
to climate change, the cost of living and debt. The situation in developing countries is being 
made more difficult amid tightening monetary policies and a strengthening US dollar. One in 
five countries is experiencing fiscal and financial stress, which left unaddressed would deepen 
hardship, increase debt defaults, widen inequality and delay the energy transition. 
At the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) a decision was reached to establish 
a loss and damage fund, particularly for those nations most vulnerable to climate events. Details 
regarding the amounts involved, and how the facility will be set up and operationalised are yet 
to be negotiated. The fund is expected to address adverse effects of climate impacts such as 
droughts, floods, rising seas and other disasters that impair the deployment of renewable energy.
Tapping pools of public funds for both developed and developing countries without burdening 
the fiscal space remains a key priority. Governments should adopt a “doing more with what is 
available” approach through enhanced collaboration among DFIs and MDBs, and by exploring 
the following mechanisms: 
Capital release from balance sheets of DFIs. Balance sheets of investors and financial institutions 
disclose rights and obligations connected to the owning and lending of assets. It is possible 
for DFIs to use those elements to raise additional funds through posting existing assets as 
collateral (provided their value is free and clear of any encumbrances), and partially repackaging 
receivables from guaranteed loan repayments (e.g. loans that are guaranteed by insurers) into new 
financial structured products in the market. The DFIs could offer a (high rated) new debt product
(e.g. a collateralised debt obligation)3
 guaranteed and managed by a bank such as an MDB 
to qualified investors (e.g. pension funds, insurers, institutional investors, etc.) and traded on 
international exchanges. However, such a product should be used with rigorous due diligence.
3 Collateralised debt obligations are asset-backed securities that bundle together a diversified portfolio of instruments (e.g. loans, 
bonds). Cash flows from underlying assets are used to repay investors.Product innovation among MDBs. Multilaterals benefit from the convening power granted by 
shareholders in both developed and developing countries, to craft, implement and operate 
innovative frameworks to mobilise capital and mitigate risks. In particular, liquidity facilities can be 
scaled up to assist renewable energy investors in fulfilling their business obligations by ensuring 
an uninterrupted flow of payments from off-takers – without posing a burden on the fiscal space 
of developing countries (local-currency-denominated PPAs can also benefit from this facility). 
These liquidity facilities can evolve to incorporate the role of guarantor supported by MDBs and 
DFIs in compliance with guidelines issued by multilaterals and agreed by shareholders. The highly 
capitalised guarantor becomes a supranational facility to mitigate credit and foreign exchange 
risks for renewable energy investors and lenders. MDBs, under the approval of host governments, 
can allocate funds and credit lines to the facility up to prudent limits determined by ministries of 
finance and central banks. 
Broadening capitalisation routes for MDBs. Capital calling from shareholders has been 
the common approach adopted by multilaterals to expand technical assistance and lending 
programmes. The new capital increases MDBs’ fund availability and enables them to place 
bonds in the global capital market, thereby raising additional capital. Bonds are placed as 
AAA-rated obligations guaranteed by MDBs – de facto, such institutions have an enviable track 
record recognised by countries and market participants in managing risks – that can be placed 
in the market, if appropriate financing vehicles are used and target markets are identified.
MDBs should now consider risk-tiered debt obligation placements with a different investment 
grade (BBB+ and above, e.g. multi-rated green bonds), implying different level of returns to 
bondholders. The initiative broadens access to the investor base – from institutional investors 
and sovereign wealth funds to corporate/qualified investors – increasing the amount of capital 
that could become available and deployed in renewable energy investments.
Meanwhile, public finance and policy should continue to be used to 
crowd in private capital. Policies and instruments beyond those used 
to mitigate risks are needed.
Public finance should continue to be used strategically to crowd in additional private capital. 
Risk mitigation instruments (e.g. guarantees, currency hedging instruments and liquidity reserve 
facilities) will still play a major role, but public finance and policy must go beyond risk mitigation. 
Examples include funding capacity building, support for pilot projects and innovative financing 
instruments such as blended finance initiatives, etc. In addition, policy makers may consider the 
following: 
Incentivise an investment swap from fossil fuels to renewable energy by banks and national 
oil companies. Incentivising investors to divert funds towards the energy transition can 
be done through measures such as phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies and adapting fiscal 
systems to account for the environmental, social and health impacts of a fossil-fuel-based 
energy system. However, the phaseout of subsidies should be accompanied by a proper 
safety net to ensure adequate standards of living for vulnerable populations (IRENA, 2022a).A supplemental way of incentivising this shift is through highlighting and recognising
the leadership role of those institutions that are paving the road through early investments in the 
energy transition. More than 30 significant financial institutions including banks, insurers, asset 
owners and asset managers have committed to stop financing fossil fuels. Governments and 
civil societies can take action to reward their leadership and encourage other institutions to take 
similar steps. After that, public pressure, along with policy and regulation, can further influence 
financial decision-making in favour of renewable energy and other energy transition technologies 
(Environmental Finance, 2022a).
Mobilise institutional investment and promote greater use of green bonds for renewables. 
With about USD 87 trillion of assets under management, institutional investors have a key role to 
play in reaching the investment levels required for the ongoing global energy transition. Greater 
participation of institutional capital will require a combination of effective policies and regulations, 
capital market solutions that address the needs of this investor class (e.g. green bonds), as 
well as a variety of internal changes and capacity building on the part of institutional investors
(IRENA, 2020d). 
Green bonds can help attract institutional investors and channel considerable additional private 
capital in the renewable energy sector, helping to fill the significant outstanding investment gap. 
Green bonds have experienced significant growth over the past decade (about 103% a year in 
2011-2021), increasing from about USD 800 million of issuances in 2007 to about USD 545 billion 
of issuances in 2021 – an all-time annual high despite pandemic-induced economic challenges. 
The cumulative value of green bond issuances broke the USD 1 trillion threshold at the end of 
2020 and stood at about USD 1.64 trillion as of the end of 2021 (Environmental Finance, 2022b). 
Some recommended actions for policy makers and public finance providers to further increase 
green bond issuances include the adoption of green bond standards in line with international 
climate objectives, the provision of technical assistance and economic incentives for green bond 
market development and the creation of bankable project pipelines (IRENA, 2020e). 
Implement regulatory sandboxes for broadening access to capital and credit instruments. 
Regulatory sandboxes designed to serve broader social and environmental goals can help unlock 
more investments. By enacting regulatory sandboxes for start-ups and investors for both grid and 
off-grid initiatives, new solutions may emerge towards enabling access to pools of capital/credit 
instruments. Such initiatives can benefit from MDBs’ support (Barbalho et al. 2022) in connection 
with other available funding agencies at local, regional and global levels. Furthermore, companies 
can be invited to participate in the sandbox with a view to pilot innovative concepts that facilitate 
risk mitigation, including foreign exchange risks in electricity exchanges. 
Facilitate local currency lending and denominate PPAs (at least partially) in local currencies. 
Local currency PPAs are helpful to address the risks of currency devaluations which may otherwise 
cripple power off-takers’ ability to make payments to power producers in hard currency (such as 
the USD) at times when the domestic currency plummets. Relatively established markets in the offgrid space, for instance, such as Kenya and Nigeria are seeing more local currency debt financing.During 2020-2021, about 28% of debt in the two countries was denominated in local currencies 
(primarily the Kenyan shilling, followed by the Nigerian naira), compared with just 11% during 
the pre-pandemic years. Going forward, low-cost local currency financing will be preferred 
for the next phase of the off-grid renewable energy sector’s development. A complementary 
mechanism to address foreign currency risks is to facilitate local currency lending for projects 
with development capital channelled through intermediaries including national banks or nonbanking financial institutions. Several countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil and Jordan, have 
piloted such approaches to catalyse investment into the renewable energy sector. 
Enhance the participation of corporate actors. Although companies that produce renewable 
energy are already providing substantial investment in the sector, non-energy-producing 
corporations have a preeminent role to play in the energy transition by driving demand for 
renewable energy. By setting up the right enabling framework, policy makers can encourage active 
corporate sourcing and unlock additional capital in the sector. Recommended actions include, 
for example, establishing a transparent system for the certification and tracking of renewable 
energy attribute certificates, enabling third-party sales between companies and independent 
power producers, and creating incentives for utilities to provide green procurement options for 
companies (IRENA, 2018b). 
Incentivise the participation of philanthropies. According to Oxfam’s report titled Survival of the 
Richest: How We Must Tax the Super-Rich Now to Fight Inequality, the richest 1% own almost half of 
the world’s wealth while the poorest half of the world own just 0.75% (Oxfam, 2023). To tap into 
the existing wealth, governments should look at incentivising philanthropies to mobilise additional 
funds into support for renewable energy that can help fight poverty, inequality, climate change and 
humanitarian crises. Philanthropies are playing an increasingly important role in bridging funding 
gaps, especially in the energy access context, where funds have gone into market development 
(e.g. technology innovation funds) and delivering financing for end users and enterprises through 
various instruments, such as results-based grants and equity. Individuals (high-net-worth individuals, 
families or households) invested an average of USD  20  million per year in off-grid renewables 
during 2015-2021, primarily through dedicated crowdfunding platforms (IRENA, 2022f). In 2021, 
individuals, bequests, foundations and corporations gave an estimated USD 485 billion to charities 
in the United States alone. These were distributed towards education, human services, foundations, 
public-society benefit organisations, health, international affairs, and environmental and other 
social services (Giving USA 2022). The energy transition being tied to all these objectives, tapping 
into these funds can help fill gaps left by governments, and support the livelihoods and well-being 
of relatively poor populations without relying on fossil fuels (Dennis, 2022). Renewables are at the heart of the global energy transition, a transition that promises to put 
the world on a climate-safe pathway while ensuring universal access to sustainable, reliable and 
affordable energy. The urgent need for accelerated renewable energy investments is further 
underscored by the widening effects of climate change around the world, growing food shortages 
and the looming energy crisis. An energy sector based on renewables can offer improved energy 
security and independence, price stability and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, all of 
which are required to achieve climate and sustainable development goals. To that end, significant 
capital must be shifted from fossil fuels to renewables at a faster pace. Investments in renewables 
must more than triple from their current level. 
This is the third edition of the biannual Global landscape of renewable energy finance report, 
jointly produced by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the Climate Policy 
Initiative (CPI). Since the last edition of the report, the world has experienced a multitude of crises 
including COVID-19, the conflict in Ukraine and associated supply chain disruptions, more frequent 
and destructive climate-induced disasters, and global inflation. The current crises present both a 
challenge and an opportunity for accelerated deployment of renewable energy. 
On the one hand, they provide the political momentum for hurrying the deployment of energy 
transition technologies. Indeed, the crisis in Ukraine has forced a global reckoning with the fact 
that 80% of the world’s population live in countries that are net energy importers, a situation that 
carries profound implications for energy security and affordability. 
On the other hand, tighter fiscal circumstances and higher costs of capital are dimming the 
prospects for renewable energy, which is particularly capital intensive. The current uncertain 
macroeconomic outlook, with inflation at levels not seen in many countries for over 40 years and 
the possibility of sovereign defaults, could threaten renewable energy development, especially in 
low-income countries. 
OVERVIEW1  The analysis of renewable energy investments in 2021 and 2022 in Chapters 1 and 2 are based on data from BNEF (2023b). Investment 
figures for previous years (2013-2020) come from the CPI Global Landscape of Climate Finance database, which gathers and 
cleans data from several sources, including Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). These figures represent “primary” financial 
transactions going into both large- and small-scale projects that directly contribute to deployment of renewable energy. They 
therefore exclude secondary transactions, e.g. refinancing of existing debts or public trading in financial markets. For more details,

2 The data in Chapter 3 cover 2010-2021 and come from Wood Mackenzie (2022a). They relate to corporate-level transactions (both 
primary and secondary) and therefore differ from the investments discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, although some overlap is possible. 
These figures are important as they provide an indication of how this rapidly emerging sector is evolving, given its importance to 
achieving universal energy access
Like the first two editions, this report analyses investment trends and financing gaps, the goal 
being to inform policy making for the deployment of renewable energy at the scale needed to 
achieve the energy transition. This third edition looks at key investment trends between 2013 and 
2020 and provides preliminary insights and figures for 2021 and 2022.1
 The report is structured 
as follows:
Chapter 1 presents an overview of the investment needed for IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. 
Investments made to date are compared with those made in fossil fuel technologies.
Chapter 2 presents the landscape of global renewable energy finance, providing insights 
into key trends by technology and sector, region, source of finance (public and private) and 
financial instrument. 
Chapter 3 provides an in-depth analysis of off-grid renewable energy finance in developing and 
emerging economies, analysing trends by technology, country, type of investor and financial 
instrument.2
Chapter 4 presents recommendations for policy makers and financial institutions to accelerate 
renewable investments globally across technologies and sectors.RENEWABLE ENERGY

CONTEXT 1.1 Investment needs for the energy transition 
Keeping the world on track to achieving the energy transition in line with the 1.5°C Scenario laid 
out in IRENA’s World energy transitions outlook 2023 will require a cumulative investment totaling 
around USD 150 trillion between 2023 and 2050. In the short term, the report estimates that 
investments would need to exceed USD 5 trillion per year between 2023 and 2030, including the 
redirection of USD 1 trillion per year from fossil fuels to energy-transition-related technologies. 
Table 1.1 shows the breakdown of annual investment needs in the short term (2023-2030) by 
technological avenue.

011.2 Global transition–related investment to date 
In 2022, global investments in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion, a record 
high, up 19% from 2021 investment levels, and almost 70% from before the pandemic in 2019 
(Figure  1.1). These include investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, electrified 
transport and heat, energy storage, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. 
While renewable energy and energy efficiency remained the largest sectors – with a combined 
value of USD 772 billion in 2022 – their share in total energy transition investments has progressively 
declined as other technologies have begun to attract larger amounts of investments. This is the 
case for electrified transport technologies (including electric vehicles and associated charging 
infrastructure),3
 which reached USD  466  billion in 2022, a 54% increase compared to 2021. 
Investments in electrified heat4 have grown rather modestly over the last few years, reaching 
USD  64  billion in 2022, while hydrogen5
 investments more than tripled from 2021, attracting 
USD 1.1 billion in 2022 (Box 1.1).

Figure 1.1 Annual global investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency and and other 
transition-related technologies, 2015-2022 
Notes: Renewable energy investments for 2021 and 2022 represent preliminary estimates based on data from BNEF. As BNEF 
has limited coverage of large hydropower investments, these were assumed to be USD 7 billion per year, equivalent to the annual 
average investment in 2019 and 2020. Energy efficiency data are from IEA (2022a). These values are in constant 2019 dollars, while 
all other values are in current prices and exchange rates. Due to the lack of more granular data, the units could not be harmonised 
across the databases. For this reason, these numbers are presented together for indicative purposes only and should not be used 
to make comparisons between data sources. Data for other energy transition technologies come from BNEF (2023a). 
Based on: CPI (2022a), IEA (2022a) and BNEF (2023a).
3 Electrified transport investments include sales of electric cars, commercial vehicles and buses, as well as home and public charging 
investments (BNEF, 2023a).
4 Electrified heat investments include residential heat pump investments (BNEF, 2023a).The increase in transition-related investments in 2022 was driven chiefly by national policies 
introduced for objectives related to climate, energy security, access and socio-economic 
development, but some of the increase can be attributed to higher costs. After years of declines, 
the costs of solar panels and wind turbines rose temporarily by 10% to 20% between 2020 and 
2022 (IEA, 2022b). The increases were due mainly to supply chain issues and higher costs for 
labour, financing, shipping and construction materials such as steel and cement.
Although hydrogen has been identified as a key technology for the energy transition, it has so far attracted only 
a fraction of energy transition–related investments: USD 1.1 billion in 2022, 0.08% of the total (BNEF, 2023a). 
Hydrogen’s role in decarbonisation lies in hard-to-abate sectors, where electrification is deemed technologically 
infeasible, impractical or not cost effective. Among these are heavy industrial processes, such as steel, 
aluminium and cement production, as well as energy-intensive modes of transport such as aviation, shipping 
and heavy-duty trucks. Hydrogen will also prove useful as a fuel in continental countries with remote cities, 
for storing energy and for providing grid flexibility. 
Green hydrogen is expected to become significantly cheaper than alternative methods. It could 
reach production costs as low as USD  1/kilogramme by 2050, compared to a lower bound of close to
USD 3/kilogramme in 2021 (IRENA, 2019). Although prospects for cost reduction are good, the cost-effective 
long-distance transport of large volumes of hydrogen remains a challenge being addressed by major 
technology developers.
Hydrogen technologies are gaining momentum across the world. Investment has been led by the Americas 
(particularly the United States), which made up 44% of overall investments in 2022, followed by Asia and the 
Pacific (mainly China) accounting for 33% of the USD 1.1 billion global total. Despite receiving relatively lower 
investments, China commissioned 2.5 times more electrolyser capacity than the Americas, but electrolysers 
sold in China are more than 70% cheaper than elsewhere. Europe and the Middle East made up the remainder of 
investments; many projects in the region struggled to reach financial close due to uncertainties over hydrogen 
standards and subsidies (BNEF, 2023c). As of October 2022, more than 60 countries had developed or were 
preparing hydrogen strategies, up from just one country (Japan) in 2017. It is expected that 115 gigawatts of 
electrolyser capacity will be added by 2030, 73% of it in Europe (IRENA, 2022b).
While current investment is significantly less than for mature renewable energy technologies such as wind 
and solar, hydrogen technology has seen strong inflows of early-stage capital as well as high levels of national 
funding in recent years. A substantial portion is in the form of venture capital. In 2021, hydrogen start-ups in 
Europe received more investment than their US counterparts (IEA, 2021). Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction 
Act in the United States, as well as similarly robust public policy in Europe, led to governments committing 
USD 126 billion to developing the hydrogen ecosystem in the first half of 2022.
Box 1.1 Hydrogen investments1.3 Renewable energy vs. fossil fuel investments up to 2021
Looking at new power generation capacity only, investments in new renewable power assets were 
consistently higher than those in new fossil fuel–powered electricity plants in the period between 
2015 and 2021. On average, USD  339  billion per year was committed globally for renewable 
power generation, compared to USD  135  billion, on average, for fossil fuel power generation
(IEA, 2022b). These investments correspond with capacity addition trends: renewables capacity 
grew by 130% between 2011 and 2021, compared to only 24% growth in non-renewables 
(Figure 1.2), with solar photovoltaic (PV) showcasing the fastest capacity growth, mostly due to 
technological advancement, high learning rates, policy support and innovative financing models 
(IRENA, 2022a).
Beyond new power generation capacity, however, investments in renewable energy are dwarfed 
by those in fossil fuels. Considering upstream, downstream and infrastructure investments,6
 fossil 
fuel capital investments – with an average USD 991 billion invested annually between 2015 and 
2022 – were almost three times higher than renewable energy investments – estimated at an 
average USD 360 billion annually (Figure 1.3).

6 Upstream investments refer to those in exploration and production of oil and gas, while downstream and infrastructure investments 
usually refer to those in refiningmanufacturingand distribution assets of oilgas and their productsFossil fuel investments declined in 2020 (down 22% from the USD 1 trillion invested in 2019), 
mainly due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on global energy markets (IEA, 2022c). 
Nevertheless, 2021 saw them bounce back up to USD  897  billion, and preliminary data for 
2022 suggest they might have almost returned to their pre-pandemic levels (+6%), reaching 
USD  953  billion (IEA, 2022c). This recovery is partly driven by rising costs across the entire 
energy sector globally, particularly in relation to reserves replacement, and partly by the conflict 
in Ukraine, which, together with high oil and gas prices, is incentivising fossil fuel exploration in 
emerging markets and developing economies, at least in the short run (see Section 1.4). 
Regionally, fossil fuel investments (including upstream, downstream and infrastructure 
investments) were highest in Asia and the Pacific followed by North America. Asia and the 
Pacific saw high fossil fuel investments across all aspects of the sector – power generation, 
upstream and downstream oil and gas infrastructure, and coal mining and associated
infrastructure – totalling over USD 1.7 trillion between 2015 and 2020 (Figure 1.4). North America 
followed at USD 1.5 trillion invested over the same period, much of which was directed towards 
upstream oil and gas. However, it was Eurasia and Central Asia that showed the biggest gulf, 
proportionately, between renewable energy and fossil fuel investments, with the latter 58 times 
higher than the former. The Middle East followed, with fossil fuel investment 28 times higher 
than renewable energy investment. The African continent also exhibited a wide gap between 
renewable energy investment and fossil fuels (the latter 10 times higher).

Note: FF = fossil fuel; RE = renewable energy. 
Based on: CPI (2022a) and IEA (2022b).Fossil fuel investments must be urgently phased out, with capital redirected to energy 
transition-related assets if the world is to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. 
Investment in energy is still going into funding new oil and gas fields instead of renewables. 
Investors and banks have already committed to financing fossil fuel development over and above 
the limit needed to stay within 1.5°C. Over the six years since the Paris Climate Agreement, some 
large multi-national banks maintained and even increased their investments in fossil fuels at an 
average of about USD 750 billion dollars a year (Environmental Finance, 2022a). The world’s 60 
largest commercial banks invested around USD 4.6 trillion in fossil fuels between 2015 and 2021, 
more than a quarter of which came from US banks (Environmental Finance, 2022a). 
Fossil fuel companies based in emerging markets and developing economies have continued 
to attract substantial volumes of financing. Between 2016 and 2022, their outstanding debt 
rose by 400% for coal and 225% for oil and gas, despite the need to align investments with 
the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement (IMF, 2022a). In Africa, substantial investments have 
been made in 48 countries over the past few years, both in exploration and in exploitation of 
recently discovered reserves, with the majority of projects being export oriented and undertaken 
by foreign companies. A study by Ganswindt et al. (2022) shows that total capital expenditures 
for oil and gas exploration in Africa rose from USD 3.4 billion in 2020 to USD 5.1 billion in 2022. 
African companies accounted for less than one-third of this sum (Table1.2).

Figure 1.4 Annual investments in renewable energy vs. fossil fuel by region, 2015-2020 
Note: FF = fossil fuel; RE = renewable energy.
Based on: CPI (2022a) and IEA (2022b).Looking ahead, it has been estimated that USD 570 billion will be spent annually on new oil 
and gas development and exploration through 2030 (IISD, 2022), despite the pledges made 
to halt such investments. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), for example, a 
coalition of financial institutions formed at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference 
(COP26) and representing USD 150 trillion in assets, announced one year after its launch that it 
has scrapped membership criteria that demanded net-zero plans and eliminated an independent 
vetting mechanism called Race to Zero (Environmental Finance, 2022a).
In addition to direct investments in fossil fuel assets, the industry continues to receive 
considerable support through subsidies. Between 2013 and 2020, USD 2.9 trillion was spent 
globally on fossil fuel subsidies (Fossil Fuels Subsidy Tracker, 2022). In 2020, Europe was the 
region providing the most subsidies, having overtaken the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) 
(Figure 1.5). On a per capita basis, fossil fuel subsidies in Europe totalled USD 113/person, more 
than triple those in MENA (USD 36/person). However, fossil fuel subsidies in MENA make up 1.56% 
of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) while in Europe, they constitute only 0.3% of GDP. 
Subsidies doubled in 2021 across 51 countries, from USD 362 billion in 2020 to USD 697 billion, 
with consumption subsidies expected to have risen even further in 2022 due to contemporaneous 
price pressures (OECD and IEA, 2022). These subsidies create significant market distortions 
wherein the negative environmental, health and social impacts of burning fossil fuels are not 
properly priced, thus affecting the competitiveness of cleaner alternatives. The phasing out of 
investments in fossil fuel assets should be coupled with the elimination of subsidies to ensure that 
the full costs of fossil fuels are reflected in their price and to level the playing field with renewables 
and other energy transition–related technologies. However, the phaseout of subsidies should 
be accompanied by a proper safety net to ensure adequate standards of living for vulnerable 
populations (IRENA, 2022a).

The global pandemic and the crisis in Ukraine have severely disrupted energy markets, on 
both the supply and demand sides. The price increases witnessed over the past year – 60% 
for oil and 400% for natural gas in Europe (CER, 2022) – first arose as post-pandemic demand 
surged around the world; they grew as Western sanctions cut imports from Russia. Although the 
prices for natural gas had returned to pre-pandemic levels by January 2023, the Ukraine crisis 
has forced a global reckoning that 80% of the world’s population lives in countries that are net 
energy importers (IRENA, 2022a), a fact that has profound implications for energy security and 
affordability. 
The European Union’s REPowerEU strategy, which aimed to cut Russian gas imports by twothirds in 2022, has had cascading effects worldwide. In Africa, key oil and gas producers, notably 
Algeria, Mozambique and Nigeria, have been given a new opportunity to cement their place in 
the global energy supply landscape, while in Asia, where liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices rose 
in response to higher European demand, some countries are turning back to coal or oil to meet 
power generation needs. Japan and the Republic of Korea returned to nuclear energy to ease 
supply concerns before the winter (ING, 2022).

Figure 1.5 Annual fossil fuels subsidies by region, 2013-2020
Source: Fossil Fuels Subsidy Tracker (2022).The current global energy crisis serves as an opportunity to speed up the renewable energy 
transition; however, supply chain costs and regulatory hurdles are obstacles to deployment, 
mainly in developed markets. France, Germany and the United Kingdom, among other countries 
inside and outside Europe, have set more aggressive renewable energy targets. France and 
Germany have committed to addressing red tape and the lengthy permitting process for offshore 
wind, while the United Kingdom is set to triple the pace of developing wind and solar projects 
(Ashurt, 2022). While steep fossil fuel prices make renewable energy comparatively more cost 
competitive, a big challenge will be supply chains, with the costs of solar and wind turbine 
components affected by spiralling inflation. The risk persists that prices for energy transition 
components will rise and limit demand growth if supply does not keep pace. In this context, 
actions to support circularity (e.g. mandating recycling of retired equipment; funding for research 
and development to reduce materials’ intensity or enable substitution) can help reduce these risks 
(Wood Mackenzie, 2022b). Indeed, solar panel supply chains have been marked by continued 
disruptions from COVID-19 lockdowns in China and by the sudden constraints on steel production 
in Ukraine and aluminium from Russia (Ashurt, 2022). At the same time, policies in Europe still
focus on further compressing prices, threatening the sustainability of the industry (IISD, 2022). 
But on a more positive note, expansionary fiscal stimulus packages (through industrial policy 
measures) by governments – for example, the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States, which 
provides tax incentives for wind, solar and other renewables – could help spur a new wave of 
public and private investment in renewables, especially as other jurisdictions look to enact similar 
packages of support for clean energy (see Section 2.3.1). However, countries outside the developed 
world may lack the fiscal space for such measures, which is why IRENA has been proposing 
a transfer of funds from the Global North to the Global South based on equity considerations 
(IRENA, 2022a).
Tighter monetary policy – pushing up interest rates and therefore the cost of capital – is hitting 
clean energy hard (Rockefeller Foundation, 2022), especially in developing markets. The 
current uncertain macroeconomic outlook, with inflation at levels not seen in many countries for 
over 40 years (ECB, 2022), could threaten renewable energy development globally. Public funding 
for the energy transition, especially in low-income countries, is enduring more challenges in a 
deteriorating economic context as governments divert attention and funds towards adjustment 
policies to deal with inflation, misalignment of supply chains, food shortages and slow growth 
(Chapter 4). 
The global energy crisis has served as a reminder to policy makers of the potential that renewable 
energy offers for solving the interlinked issues of energy security, energy sustainability, energy 
affordability and energy access, particularly for the Global South. Renewables also create a much 
broader industry/economy for shareholders, investors, lenders, producers, technology providers 
and users. The following chapter focuses on investments in renewables. THE LANDSCAPE
OF RENEWABLE 
ENERGY FINANCE
FROM 2013 TO 2022 02
Despite multiple economic, social and geopolitical challenges, annual investments in renewable 
energy continued a positive trend that began after 2018 (see Figure 2.1). In 2020, renewable energy 
investments reached USD 348 billion, representing a 5.6% increase from 2019. The Sankey diagram 
in Figure 2.2 provides an overview of the global landscape of renewable energy finance, depicting 
flows along their investment life cycle in 2019 and 2020. Preliminary data suggest that investments 
further accelerated in 2021 and 2022. In 2021, investments reached USD  430  billion (24% up
from 2020) and in 2022 they further increased by 16% reaching USD 499 billion (BNEF, 2023b).1

Note: CAGR = compound annual growth rate; CSP = concentrated solar power; PV = photovoltaic. 
Source: CPI (2022a). Investments for 2021 and 2022 are preliminary estimates based on data from BNEF (2023b). As BNEF data 
has limited coverage of large hydropower investments, these were assumed to be USD 7 billion per year, equivalent to the annual 
average investment for the preceding two years.
1 These figures represent “primary” financial transactions in both large- and small-scale projects that directly contribute to 
deployment of renewable energy, and therefore exclude secondary transactions, e.g. refinancing of existing debts or public trading 
in financial markets. Note that this is different from investments discussed in Chapter 3 for the off-grid renewable energy sector 
which relates to corporate-level transactions (both primary and secondary) and is therefore different from investments discussed in The increase in renewable energy investments has been driven by 1)  policy makers growing 
awareness of the importance of renewable energy in fighting climate change, strengthening 
energy security and reducing dependence on volatile energy sources; and 2) investors’ appetite 
for alternatives to balance out the volatility and risks of investments in fossil fuels. The years 2020 
and 2021 also coincided with deadlines in some jurisdictions for achieving renewable energy 
targets and applying for support mechanisms, notable examples being the feed-in tariffs (FiTs) 
in China and Viet Nam (Do et al. 2021; Jaghory, 2022), both of which demonstrate the power of 
policy incentives in the deployment of renewable energy.
While annual investments have continued to grow – at a compound annual growth rate of 8.5% 
over 2013-2022 – renewable energy costs declined dramatically during that period, meaning 
that a dollar invested today translates into higher capacity installed than it did in the past. For 
instance, between 2013 and 2021 the global weighted average of total installed costs for solar PV, 
onshore wind and offshore wind came down by 69%, 33% and 45%, respectively (IRENA, 2022c). 
Without these cost reductions, far higher investments would be needed to bring the same level 
of capacity online.

Figure 2.2 Global landscape of renewable energy finance, 2019-2020 (USD billion) 2.1 Investments by technology
Between 2013 and 2022, solar and wind technologies consistently attracted the largest 
share of investment in renewables by a wide margin, as shown in Figure 2.3. In 2020, solar 
PV alone attracted 43% of the total, followed by onshore wind (at 35%) and offshore wind
(at a record 12%).
2
 Solar thermal attracted just 4% of total investments. The attractiveness of 
solar and wind over other renewable energy technologies can be traced back to their increasing 
maturity, efficiency advances and continued declines in technology costs (with the exception of 
the temporary increases experienced in 2021 and 2022), in part due to the greater policy support 
these technologies have received compared to the other technologies. In addition, the shorter 
lead times of these technologies and the modular and distributed nature of solar PV make them 
the most suitable technologies to deliver specific objectives.

Source: CPI (2022a). Investments for 2021 and 2022 represent preliminary estimates based on data from BNEF (2023b). As BNEF 
data has limited coverage of large hydropower investments, these were assumed to be USD 7 billion per year, equivalent to the 
annual average investment over 2019-2020.
2 The analysis of renewable energy investments in this chapter is mainly based on data from the CPI Global Landscape of Climate 
Finance database covering investments made up to 2020. Investments for 2021 and 2022 are presented as preliminary data from 
Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF)2.1.1 Solar technologies
Investment in solar technologies reached a combined total of USD 162 billion in 2020, an 11% 
increase from 2019, but still slightly lower than average investments in the preceding two years 
of 2017-2018. However, solar investments shot up in the past two years (based on preliminary 
data from BNEF) reaching USD  226 billion in 2021 (an almost 40% increase from 2020)  and 
USD 308 billion in 2022 (a further 36% increase from 2021), as shown in Figure 2.4.
Increased maturity and declining costs helped attract investments in solar technologies, 
particularly in solar PV deployment, which accounts for around 90% of total solar investments 
between 2013 and 2020, with the remaining going to solar thermal (including concentrated 
solar power [CSP]) (Figure 2.4). By end use, the majority of solar investments went to power 
generation during that period, with a small fraction (9%) targeting heat generation technologies, 
namely solar water heaters. 
China and the United States consistently attract the majority of annual solar investments, with 
their combined share making up about 50% of all solar investments since 2013. Reductions and 
delays in solar investments have occurred in some major countries, including Japan and India 
(down 54% and 29% between 2019 and 2020, respectively), partly due to policy changes and the 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in these two countries. However, these reductions were offset 
by investment growth in China and the United States (36% and 13%, respectively, between 2019 
and 2020), as well as in Viet Nam, where solar investments grew ninefold from 2019, driven by a 
FiT programme (Box 2.2).
In terms of installed capacity in the power sector, during 2013-2021, 714 gigawatts (GW) of solar 
PV and CSP were added globally, with capacity additions increasing by an average 19% each year 
(Figure 2.4).3
 For heating, most of the solar thermal installations (excluding CSP) were made prior 
to 2013 (almost 400 gigawatts thermal [GWth] out of the total 522 GWth installed by 2021 had 
come online before 2013), as solar water heaters, especially small-scale systems, reached maturity 
earlier than other solar technologies. In 2021, large-scale solar heating systems for district heating 
and for residential, commercial and public buildings (>350 kilowatt thermal [kWth]) were added, 
mainly in China, Europe, Türkiye and Mexico. Meanwhile, interest in solar thermal systems for 
industrial processes has grown steadily around the globe (Weiss and Spörk-Dür, 2022).

Investment in onshore and offshore wind reached a combined total of USD 161 billion in 2020, 
a 4% increase from 2019, and preliminary data from BNEF show that investments reached 
USD 176 billion per year on average between 2021 and 2022, a 9% increase from 2020, as shown 
in Figure 2.5.

Figure 2.4 Annual investments vs. capacity additions for solar energy technologies, 2013-2022
Note: A decrease in investments in a given year may not translate into a decrease in the capacity installed in that same year; in 2016, 
for example, investments went down yet capacity added went up. This is in part due to cost decreases and in part due to the time lag 
between the financing and completion of a project. The lag is estimated to be about 0.5 years for solar PV, and 2 years for solar thermal, 
although some projects can take longer to be commissioned. CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic. 
Source: CPI (2022a) and IRENA (2022c). Investments for 2021 and 2022 represent preliminary estimates based on data from BNEF 
(2023b).During 2013-2022, onshore wind accounted for 80% of total investment in wind technologies. 
In 2019, onshore wind investment saw a 32% increase from 2018 to reach a record high of 
USD 133 billion before declining 9% in 2020 to USD 120 billion and rising again to an average of 
USD 140 billion in 2021 and 2022, according to preliminary data. 
Meanwhile, offshore wind investment reached USD 40 billion in 2020, nearly doubling the 2019 
amount, while preliminary data show 2021-2022 investments to be USD 37 billion, a 7.5% decrease 
from 2020 but still 68% higher than 2019.

Figure 2.5 Annual investments vs. capacity additions for wind energy technologies, 2013-2022
Note: A decrease in investments in a given year may not translate into a decrease in the capacity installed in that same year; in 2017, 
for example, investments went up yet capacity added went down. This is in part due to cost decreases and in part due to the time 
lag between the financing and completion of a project. The lag is estimated to be about 0.9 years for onshore wind and 2 years for 
offshore wind, although some projects can take longer to be commissioned. GW = gigawatt. 
Source: CPI (2022a) and IRENA (2022d). Investments for 2021 and 2022 represent preliminary estimates based on data from BNEF 
(2023b).Policies in China drove the recent increase in wind investments, as project developers accelerated 
installation to meet the deadlines for the FiTs for onshore wind ending in August 2021 and for 
offshore wind at the end of 2021 (Fitch Ratings, 2021; Jaghory, 2022). For offshore wind, while 
China accounted for 48% of total investment in 2020, major increases were also recorded in 
Europe, mainly in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Technological improvements such as 
larger turbines, specialised logistics and manufacturing, and standardisation have helped drive 
down costs and enabled more installations in deeper water farther from shore (IRENA, 2022c).
In terms of capacity, during 2013-2021, 557 GW of onshore and offshore wind were added globally, 
with capacity additions increasing by an average of 19% each year. In 2021, while onshore wind 
capacity additions declined by 31%, new offshore capacity more than tripled (Figure 2.5).4 Lower 
onshore capacity additions in 2021 were due to a decline in installations in the two largest markets 
for onshore wind – China and the United States. In China, the drop was mainly a consequence of 
record-high installations in 2020 (+50 GW), as the deadline to qualify for the onshore wind FiT 
was set at the end of the year. In the United States, supply chain problems led to some projects 
being delayed or postponed in the second half of 2021 (GWEC, 2022).
2.1.3 Other renewable energy technologies
Over the 2013-2022 period, while investments in solar and wind increased, combined investments 
in other renewable energy technologies declined, as shown in Figure 2.6. These technologies 
include hydropower (including pumped hydropower), biomass, biofuels, geothermal and marine 
energy.5
 Between 2017 and 2022, the total investment in these technologies declined by 45%, 
from USD 35 billion to USD 17 billion. Moreover, their share in total annual investments dropped 
from 11% in 2017 to 3% in 2022 (preliminary data). 
As these technologies have different characteristics, there are different reasons that have 
contributed to the lack of investment growth. 
For hydropower, particularly large-scale plants (with capacity greater than 10 megawatts), many 
of the locations available for construction are already utilised, especially in countries that rely 
heavily on hydropower, with potential new areas usually located in less accessible locations, 
making construction significantly more expensive. In addition, the construction of new large 
hydropower plants may encounter opposition from local populations and environmental groups. 
Comprehensive mitigation measures may be needed to manage possible negative social and 
environmental impacts (IRENA, 2023b).
The future use of modern biomass for electricity and heat generation depends heavily on the 
availability of low-cost feedstock. For biofuels, investments depend on policy incentives such 
as blending targets, which have changed over the years, influenced by market fundamentals 
(feedstock and oil prices, distribution costs, customers’ disposable incomes and preferences). 
4 Data on installed capacity for 2022 were not available at the time of writing.
5 Tracked investments include only investments in energy production facilities (e.g. they exclude investments needed to secure and 
transport feedstock or construction equipment)For more detailsplease see the methodology document (Appendix)While a tripling of investments in biofuel and biomass in 2021 is a positive development, policies 
driving these investments should be designed to ensure their sustainable use (IRENA, 2022e). 
Marine energy is still considered too expensive, owing to its limited economies of scale (most 
projects being limited to demonstration scale) and technical difficulties (IRENA, 2020b). For 
geothermal, the high cost of surface exploration and drilling has been the main obstacle to 
funding (IRENA, 2017).

Figure 2.6 Annual investments vs. capacity additions for renewable energy technologies other than 
solar and wind, 2013-2021
Note: A decrease in investments in a given year may not translate into a decrease in the capacity installed in that same year; in 2017, 
for example, investments went up, yet capacity added went down. This is in part due to cost decreases and in part to the time lag 
between the financing and completion of a project. The typical lag is 1.7 years for bioenergy, 2 years for geothermal, 2.3 years for 
small hydropower and 2 years for marine. GW = gigawatt. 
Source: CPI (2022a) and IRENA (2022d). Investments for 2021 and 2022 represent preliminary estimates based on data from BNEF 
(2023b). As BNEF data has limited coverage of large hydropower investments, these were assumed to be USD 7 billion per year, 
equivalent to the annual average investment in 2019 and 2020.Hydropower and biomass have consistently received the largest share of investments after solar 
and wind technologies, although investment amounts have fluctuated over time. While there was 
an increase in hydropower annual investment in 2017 due to a major commitment from the China 
Development Bank (Chen X. et al. 2020), annual investment in hydropower has levelled off since then, 
ranging between USD 7 and USD 9 billion. In terms of capacity additions, about 201 GW of total 
hydropower capacity was added between 2013 and 2021, the third highest among renewable energies. 
2.2 Investments by application (power vs. end uses)
Investments in renewable energy for end uses need to be urgently scaled up, in parallel with 
efforts towards renewable energy power generation and end-use electrification. While annual 
renewable energy investments have been growing over time, these have been concentrated in 
the power sector. Between 2013 and 2020, power generation assets attracted, on average, 90% 
of renewable investments each year, and up to 97% in 2021 and 2022. 
Investments in end uses, i.e. direct applications, which include heat generation (e.g. solar water 
heaters, geothermal heat pumps, biomass boilers) and transport (e.g. biofuels) are lagging. Over time 
this gap has increased, as shown in Figure 2.7. In 2020, renewable energy for end-use applications 
received less than 5% of the total (or USD 17 billion), down from 8.5% in 2013 (or USD 20 billion). 
It should be noted, however, that a large share of investments in end-use applications is made at the 
household or firm level (e.g. biomass boilers, geothermal heat pumps), and data on such investments 
can be limited, affecting the overall investment figures provided throughout this report (see Box 2.1).

in large hydropower technology in 2021 was estimated as an average of 2019-2020 investmentsThe category “Unknown” includes This leaves a substantial portion of the global energy system heavily reliant on fossil fuels, as in 
2019 the share of renewables in the total final energy consumption was only 11.2% for heating and 
cooling, and 3.2% for transport (REN21, 2022). 
Even though power accounts for half of the total energy consumption by 2050 according to 
IRENA's 1.5°C Scenario, and there have been measures to encourage electrification for end uses 
such as electric vehicles and heat pumps in some countries (chiefly members of the OECD), 
support for more widespread adoption of direct uses of renewables will be needed to accelerate 
the decarbonisation of the entire energy system (IRENA, 2022a).
Based on IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, direct applications for end uses will be crucial to replace fossil 
fuels in the industrial, residential and transport sectors. Investments in renewables for end uses 
need to increase significantly, from USD 13 billion in 2022 to an average of USD 269 per year 
between 2023-2030 (Table 1.1). To achieve this, deployment policies such as targets, mandates, 
financial incentives, and enabling policies such as awareness promotion, and funding for research

Initiative’s Global Landscape of Climate Finance database, which captures primary investment in electricity 
production and end-use applications made in the technologies listed below.

2.3.1 Investment by region of destination
The East Asia and Pacific region continues to attract the majority of global renewable energy 
investment. Countries of the region received USD 137 billion in 2019 and USD 170 billion in 2020 
(or 42% and 49% of global renewable energy financing for those years) (Figure 2.8). Preliminary 
data for 2021 and 2022 indicate that the share of investments going to the East Asia and Pacific 
region surpassed 50% in 2021, rising to two-thirds of the global total in 2022, led by China.
China attracted the lion’s share of investment in the region (84% in 2019 and 79% in 2020). 
Between 2013 and 2020, China alone attracted 23-39% of global renewable investments each 
year, most of them raised domestically. China’s story is one of immense government ambition 
to contain peak emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 (Energy Post, 2022).

North Africa, Other Oceania, Transregional, Other Asia and Unknown. For more details on the geographic classification used in the 
analysis, please see methodology document (Appendix).
Source: CPI (2022a). Investments for 2021 and 2022 represent preliminary estimates based on data from BNEF (2023b).Concerns about climate change, energy security and air pollution have led the country to invest 
historic sums in renewable energy deployment and development (Chiu, 2017); USD 792 billion was 
invested in renewable energy projects in 2013-2020, as investments grew 17% a year on average. 
Nearly 99% of this was funded domestically. Also, considerable public investment has gone into 
creating an enabling environment for deployment at this scale, and the pace of this investment has 
accelerated sharply in recent years. In 2022, China invested more than USD 274 billion (an amount 
greater than all global investments made in 2013), up from USD 176 billion and USD 115 billion in 
2021 and 2020, respectively.
Consistent strong investments in wind and solar put China on track to meet its target of having 
1 200 GW of installed capacity in these technologies by 2030 (Carbon Brief, 2021), as set out in the 
14th Five-Year Plan announced in 2022. A suite of policies, including value added tax exemptions 
on renewable energy generation, income tax exemptions for renewable energy developers and 
guaranteed purchase of renewable energy by utilities have been instrumental in this growth. 
China’s targeted policies have had substantial effects on investment. The 2014 announcement 
of a FiT for offshore wind was followed by a fivefold increase in investment in this sector in 
2015 (Figure 2.9) (BNEF, 2022a). Annual investment grew by 20 times in the few years between 
2014 and 2019. Likewise, onshore wind investment in China surged in 2019 and 2020 as 
developers rushed to install projects before the expiration of a national FiT at the end of 2020
(REN21, 2022).

Source: CPI (2022a).Investment in renewable energy has grown significantly in Viet Nam, which overtook Japan to 
become the region’s second-largest destination of capital in 2020, largely due to expiring FiT 
applications (Lorimer, 2021). Domestic private investment in solar PV is an important part of the 
regional story. From 2013 to 2020, investment grew by an average of 219% per year, rising from 
only USD 47 million to nearly USD 18.7 billion. Private domestic investment in solar PV accounted 
for 58% of total financing over this period. Spurred by lower interest rates, favourable policy and 
strong growth in power-hungry industries, solar PV projects in Viet Nam added 19 GW of capacity 
in 2019-2020 (Climatescope, 2022a). However, after the FiT expired, investments declined quickly 
– from about USD 18.7 billion in 2020 to about USD 9.7 billion in 2021, to less than USD 4.7 billion 
in 2022. Box 2.2 examines the growth of investments in Viet Nam in greater detail, and compares 
this trend with that of neighbouring Thailand. 
North America (excluding Mexico) saw the second-highest investment in renewables, attracting 
USD 68 billion in 2019 and USD 53 billion in 2020 (equivalent to 21% and 15% of the global total, 
respectively). Much of this was focused on the United States, and the share of funding going 
to the region has gradually declined in recent years due to a drop in domestic US investments 
(BNEF, 2022c). According to preliminary data, investments in the region increased to almost 
USD 66 billion in 2021 and then decreased to USD 59 billion in 2022 (BNEF, 2023b). The imminent 
closing of the Production Tax Credit in the United States may have been one cause for the fall in 
investments – mostly onshore wind - from 2019 to 2020. 
The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act in the United States intended to spur a new wave of domestic 
investment. New tax credits and USD 30 billion in targeted grants and loans for clean energy 
generation and storage were earmarked for the renewable energy sector. This is 11 times higher 
than the total USD  2.6  billion in direct government financing seen from 2013 to 2020. The 
earmarked USD  60  billion in support of manufacturing of low-carbon components, including 
solar panels and wind turbines, seeks to further crowd in private investment (US Congress, 2022). 
Investments in the US renewable energy sector are expected to reach USD 114 billion by 2031, 
driven by the momentum of the Inflation Reduction Act (PV Magazine, 2023).
Europe attracted USD 54 billion in 2019 and USD 67 billion in 2020 (16% and 19% of the global 
total, respectively). Preliminary data suggest investments reached USD 77 billion in 2021, but 
dropped to USD 61 billion in 2022 (BNEF, 2023b). 
In 2020, investments in the region grew by a record 24% compared to 2019, driven primarily 
by an almost fourfold increase in investments in the United Kingdom and an almost threefold 
increase in the Netherlands, compared to 2019. This increase was driven by an almost fourfold 
increase in offshore wind investments – from USD 4 billion in 2019 to USD 17 billion in 2020 – 
while investments in solar PV and onshore wind remained stable.
Offshore wind investment in Europe continues to be led by the United Kingdom, the Netherlands 
and Germany. In the United Kingdom, the Renewables Obligation on companies to source an 
increasing share of their energy needs from renewables, and its successor, the Contract for 
Difference mechanism, have decreased investor risk, lowered the cost of capital and prompted a Viet Nam’s rapid industrialisation has prompted a surge in energy demand. Much of this industrial growth has 
been fuelled by foreign direct investment, as companies look to diversify their supply chains away from China. 
Rooftop solar installations in industrial parks have grown to meet these companies’ requirements for renewable 
energy (and more climate-friendly products). The country has incentivised the growth of renewable energy 
generation via feed-in tariffs (FiTs) in the solar industry. Tariffs for onshore and offshore wind were made 
more generous in 2018 after poor initial uptake (BNEF, 2022b). Coal is still the primary source of electricity 
production in the country, though slow development of new plants led the government to pivot to solar (and 
later wind) along with gas to meet its rising energy needs (Government of Viet Nam, 2016).
In contrast, investment in neighbouring Thailand has been anaemic (Figure 2.10). This can be partly explained 
by differences in the two countries’ stages of economic growth, and energy mixes, among other factors. 
While endowed with similar natural resources, economic growth in the 1990s helped Thailand set up a wellfunctioning and robust power supply. A subsequent decline in economic growth rates slowed energy demand 
significantly, and Thailand’s demand now lags that of its rapidly industrialising neighbour. In 2020, due to 
restrictions associated with COVID-19, Thailand’s installed capacity exceeded demand by 40%. 
Government ambitions are the other side of the story. Thailand’s Power Development Plan aims for a 10 GW 
expansion in solar PV capacity by 2037, whereas Viet Nam has targeted an additional 18 GW of solar PV 
capacity by 2030 and another 18 GW from wind power (BNEF, 2022b). With renewable energy growth in 
Thailand remaining tepid for the foreseeable future, private energy giants such as Super Energy Corp have 
been increasingly turning to foreign markets, including Viet Nam, to fuel growth. 
Both countries have used generous FiTs to help grow the supply of renewable energy. However, Viet Nam’s 
high energy demand and ambitious renewable energy targets have made FiTs a more effective policy tool. 
Viet Nam serves as a positive model for other countries experiencing similar growth.

Source: CPI (2022a).The Netherlands feed-in premiums scheme and energy tax exemption for renewable energy 
generators have also prompted rapid growth in the industry, which led the continent in offshore 
wind investment in 2020 (Climatescope, 2022b). Germany has also chosen to pursue a FiT and 
national and state grants to accelerate growth in renewable energy generation (BNEF, 2022d).
Across the continent, net-zero commitments and extensive policies to phase out fossil fuels are 
driving growth in renewable energy. The Green New Deal commits members of the European 
Union (EU) to reducing net emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 (European 
Commission, 2022). Building on this, the European Commission presented a Green Deal Industrial 
Plan for the Net-Zero Age in February 2023, which would provide investment aid and tax breaks 
towards technological development, manufacturing, production and installation of net-zero 
products in green sectors including renewables and hydrogen (Bloomberg, 2023; European 
Commission, 2023). The plan looks to mobilise EUR 225 billion in loans from its existing Recovery 
and Resilience Facility, and an additional EUR 20 billion in grants (European Commission, 2023).
The plan came soon after the announcement of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act in the United 
States, as Europe looks to stay competitive in the net-zero age. 
A forthcoming Net-Zero Industry Act seeks to streamline permitting processes, with the view to 
speed development and reduce costs. After a rocky start, the European Emission Trading scheme 
provides the largest and one of the most functional cap-and-trade systems of any economic bloc.
Regions home to about 120 developing and emerging markets continue to receive comparatively 
low investments, attracting a combined investment of USD 59 billion and USD 51 billion in 2019 
and 2020, respectively. Among these, Latin America and the Caribbean attracted 6.1% (2019) and 
4.9% (2020) of global investments, followed by South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, 
Eurasia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Across these regions, the bulk of renewable energy investments 
is captured by only a handful of countries: Brazil, Chile and India (Figure 2.11).

Figure 2.11 Renewable energy investments in developing and emerging markets, by top countries, 
2013-2020In 2022, more than 50% of the worlds population, mostly residing in developing and emerging 
countries, received only 15% of global investments in renewables. Further, the share of renewable 
energy investments going to these countries has been gradually declining year on year (e.g. 
from 27% in 2017 to 15% in 2022). In absolute terms, annual investments have been declining 
precipitously since 2018 at an average rate of 36%. Countries defined as “least developed” by 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change attracted only 0.84% of renewable energy 
investments on average between 2013 and 2020.
Looking at investments on a per capita basis further reveals the disparity in investments. 
In East Asia and Pacific, investment per capita increased by 51% between 2015 and 2021 from 
USD 70/person in 2015 to USD 105/person in 2021. The bulk of the increase took place in China, 
while Japan experienced a 45% decline over the same period. Excluding these two countries, the 
region experienced a more than 6-fold increase led by countries such as Viet Nam and Republic 
of Korea.
In South Asia, investments per capita declined by 6% between 2015 and 2021, however the true 
extent of the decline is masked by India which saw investment per capita grow by 34% in the 
same period. Excluding India, investment per capita declined by 61% from USD 12/person in 2015 
to USD 5/person in 2021.

Percentage change in investment per capita (%) > 10% 0% < 10% < 0%The most striking growing disparity is between North America (excluding Mexico) and Europe, and 
Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, renewable energy investment per capita in North America (excluding 
Mexico) and Europe was almost 23 times higher than that of Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2021, investment 
per capita in Europe was 41 times that in Sub-Saharan Africa (which in 2021 fell to just USD 3/person 
from USD 6/person in 2015), and North America was 57 times more (Table 2.1). 
IRENA analysed the finance landscape of Africa in its publication, Renewable energy market analysis: 
Africa and its regions (IRENA, 2022f). The report showed that of the USD 2.8 trillion invested 
in renewable energy globally between 2000 and 2020, only 2% – equivalent to USD 60 billion, 
excluding large hydropower – went to Africa, despite the continent’s enormous potential and 
needs (Figure 2.12). Moreover, the report showed that 75% of the investments made between 2010 
and 2020 went to just four countries: South Africa, Morocco, Egypt and Kenya. These countries 
offer relatively favourable risk-return profiles owing to their policy and institutional environment, 
regulations, access to finance and market characteristics (e.g. size, prospects and stability). 
Looking at African regions, North Africa was the second-largest recipient of renewable energy 
investments on the continent during 2000-2020, after Southern Africa (Figure 2.12). Morocco 
and Egypt received the majority of funding (47% and 45%, respectively), primarily for solar PV 
(57%) and onshore wind (22%). The North African region benefits from greater private sector 
participation than is seen elsewhere on the continent. In 2020, private actors provided 65% of all 
renewable energy finance in North Africa, up from only 11% in 2013.

Figure 2.12 Cumulative renewable energy investment in Africa and globally, 2000-2020
Source: IRENA (2022f).The share of global renewable energy investments going to Sub-Saharan Africa remains small. 
The region received less than USD  41  billion cumulatively during 2000-2020 – that is, less 
than 1.5% of the amount invested globally during that period. Investments in the region have 
been on a downward trend (from USD 5.3 billion in 2019 to less than USD 3.6 billion in 2022), 
despite the fact that the world emerged from the pandemic supposedly recognising the critical 
role energy plays in enabling health care, sanitation, telecommunications and resilient livelihoods. 
However, in reality, the inequality in the spread of investments between the Global North and the 
Global South only increased.
In Southern Africa, South Africa was the primary destination of this financing, having received 
USD 17 billion during this period, or 40% of total investment in the region. Much of this came in the 
form of private domestic investment in solar PV and wind projects, totalling USD  3.9  billion and 
USD 4.2 billion over the period, respectively. The pre-eminence of South Africa in the region can 
be explained by its relatively mature renewable energy market – perceived as relatively less risky 
by investors – and a burgeoning commitment to decarbonising the national energy system. The 
Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program, introduced in 2011, as well as 
South Africa’s Integrated Resource plan and Integrated Energy Plan explicitly target a more diverse 
energy mix, and have provided confidence for private sector investors beyond that offered by other 
large economies in Sub-Saharan Africa (Climatescope, 2022c). Looking ahead, South Africa is among 
the first countries to benefit from the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) funding (see Box 4.1). 
In East Africa, Kenya dominates, receiving 49% of overall investments in the region, with private 
sources of capital playing an increasingly larger role in recent years. FiTs (though faced with a 
backlog of applications), along with growing demand as the country aims for 100% electricity 
access, have contributed to this increase. In other East African markets, renewable energy 
investments continue to be low and financed primarily through public sources, which accounted 
for 57% of investments in the region during 2013-2020, the majority coming from bilateral and 
multilateral development finance institutions (DFIs) (51%). 
The situation is similar in West Africa, where 61% of renewable energy investments during 2013-
2020 came from public sources, about half of them backed by bilateral and multilateral DFIs. Half 
of all renewable energy investments in the region went to just two countries – Nigeria (29%) and 
Senegal (21%). In terms of technologies, investments were mainly in solar PV (55%) and onshore 
wind (13%) projects. 
Central Africa received the lowest levels of investment of any region on the continent, despite the 
dire need to expand energy access. About 56% of financing comes from public sources, though 
some markets are able to attract a significant proportion of investment from private sources, 
namely Angola (57%) and Chad (79%). 
The need for increased investment in renewable energy in Sub-Saharan Africa becomes even 
clearer as much of the region struggles to reach universal access to electricity. Providing electricity 
to the 600 million Africans that lack it is crucial to the continent’s development. However, the 
USD 9 billion in renewable energy investments that the continent attracted on average in 2019/20 2.3.2 Investment by region of origin
During 2013-2020, the majority of renewable energy investments (83%) were made domestically, 
i.e. funded through in-country sources. The share of domestic investments was higher in regions 
with mature renewable energy markets such as East Asia and Pacific (96%), North America 
(excluding Mexico) (87%) and Europe (85%) (Figure 2.13). 
By contrast, only 61% of investment flowing to the Middle East and North Africa and 50% to
Sub-Saharan Africa originated from domestic sources, highlighting the dependency of these 
markets on international capital. 
The COVID-19 pandemic, aggravated by the recent economic and energy crises, has had especially 
damaging effects on emerging and developing economies in terms of impacts on consumers’ 
income, companies’ balance sheets and public finances. This makes it likely that these markets 
will continue to rely on international public and private funding in the coming years. 
Given the prevalence of domestic investments, the distribution of renewable energy investment 
by source region matches the distribution by target region (Figure 2.14). The East Asia and Pacific 
region invested most heavily, accounting for 44% and 51% of total investments in 2019 and 2020, 
respectively. China alone provided 82% (2019) and 79% (2022) of this. Next were investors based 
in Europe (providing 22% of investments in 2019 and 2020) and in North America (excluding 
Mexico) (20% in 2019, 15% in 2020).

Source: CPI (2022a)2.4 Investments by financial instrument
This analysis considers three types of financial instruments: project-level financing (debt and 
equity), balance sheet financing (debt and equity) and grants.6
The share of equity financing fell from 77% in 2013 to 43% by 2020, globally. Therein, balance 
sheet financing (equity portion) accounted for 55% of equity investment, on average, while 
project-level equity averaged 45% over the period (see Figure 2.16). Conversely, the share of debt 
financing increased – from 23% in 2013 to 56% in 2020. This is likely linked to the maturation and 
consolidation of major renewable technologies such as solar PV and onshore wind that are able 
to attract high levels of debt, as lenders are able to envision regular and predictable cash flows 
over the long term, facilitated by power purchase agreements (PPAs) and other policy support 
(e.g. FiTs) in many countries. Going forward, widespread mobilisation of low-cost debt will be 
critical for deployment of capital-intensive renewable energy projects, while equity financing will 
also remain key, particularly to kickstart relatively less mature technologies, and finance projects 
in relatively high-risk or credit-constrained contexts. 
In terms of financing structures, project financing has been declining since 2013, while balance sheet 
financing has shown growth in recent years. The share of project equity fell from 40% in 2013 to 
10% in 2020 while the debt and equity portions of balance sheet financing constituted 30% and 31%, 
respectively, of total commitments by 2020. Project finance transfers risks from the lender to the 
project developer and insurance structures through non-recourse financing, based on the projected 
cash flow of the project over a specific period. Balance sheet finance, on the other hand, involves 
using retained earnings from business activities to finance assets on a company’s balance sheet, an 
indication of the extent to which a company self-finances its assets. As the renewable energy sector 
has matured, and project developers have grown their portfolios, balance sheet financing has become 
a viable structure when the cost of non-recourse finance becomes more expensive, and risks are well 
understood and mitigated. It also allows the company to transfer gains to equity shareholders. 
6 Project-level financing: debt or equity investment relying on a project’s cash flow for repayment. Balance sheet financing: direct 
debt or equity investment in a recipient entity by a company or financial institution. Grants: transfers made in cash, goods or 
services for which no repayment is requiredIn 2019/2020,7 over half of solar PV investment (57%) was channelled via equity while investment 
in onshore wind was still dominated by debt (69%) (see Figure 2.17). The lower share of equity in 
onshore wind relative to solar PV could relate to the larger role played by state-owned financial 
institutions in developing wind projects – such institutions generally prefer debt lending.

Source: CPI (2022a).
Source: CPI (2022a).The share of concessional finance (grants and low-cost project debt8) remained small, 
accounting for only 1% of total renewable energy finance in 2020. Scarce concessional finance – 
most often provided by governments and multilateral, bilateral or national DFIs – is not making 
its way to less mature markets, which means the energy transition is not able to advance in many 
developing countries (Chapter 4). 
Governments provided the majority of grant-based finance (55%), with DFIs together contributing 
93% of total low-cost project debt committed for renewable energy between 2013 and 2020. Of 
the concessional finance that could be tracked to specific countries, 68% was directed to lowand lower-middle-income countries.9
 Within that pool of grants and low-cost debt, 30% flowed 
to the least-developed countries.10 It is now widely acknowledged that blended finance – the 
strategic use of concessional finance to mobilise additional private capital – is a key tool for 
easing investor concerns and supporting long-term market growth, especially for more niche, less 
commercial renewable energy technologies (Mutambatsere and de Vautibault, 2022). Indeed, 
DFIs (particularly multilateral development banks) have an important role to play in de-risking 
renewable energy projects for new markets or technologies. This topic is discussed in Chapter 4. 
Among regions, Latin America and the Caribbean had the largest share of concessional finance 
(37%); other developing regions had a more even spread. The share of low-cost project debt 
was also largest in Latin America and the Caribbean (43% of total low-cost debt), while SubSaharan Africa received the most grant financing (29% of total grants between 2013 and 2020). 
These regional trends are explained by the relative dominance of DFIs providing low-cost debt in 
Latin America, and a mix of DFIs and governments providing grants in Sub-Saharan Africa. Grant 
finance is essential for building a pipeline of bankable projects, helping projects reach a level of 
maturity that might attract investors, launching pilot projects, as well as helping to fund nonprofit-driven activities such as geothermal exploration drilling or the decommissioning of fossil 
fuel plants (IRENA, 2016a). 
Looking at all financial instruments (concessional and non-concessional) by region, public 
spending (particularly multilateral development finance – see Section 2.5.2) dominated in most 
developing markets, hence their higher shares of debt lending. A group of countries in Central 
Asia – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (classified as Other Asia in this report) – had the 
largest portion of debt lending over the period 2013-2020 (69%), followed by Latin America and 
the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa (each at 58%) (Figure 2.18). In Europe and North America, 
on the other hand, private finance dominated (see Section 2.5), with high investment from 
commercial financial institutions and corporations, resulting in the emergence of equity finance 
in these regions. Projects tagged as Transregional were heavily dominated by equity investments 
(85%). Oceania also had a higher proportion of equity investments than other regions (65%), due 
to the relatively larger role of households and individuals in financing renewable energy.

Source: CPI (2022a).Innovative, context-specific instruments and financing structures are needed to scale up and 
accelerate investment in renewable energy and address investment barriers, especially in regions 
and technologies still perceived as risky. These are discussed in Chapter 4.
The market for fixed-income securities is also expanding and holds great potential for channelling 
considerable capital into energy transition–related technologies, including renewable energy. 
These types of instruments, including green, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked bonds, 
are discussed in detail in the deep dive Section on sustainable fixed income market.
Deep dive: Sustainable fixed-income market
The fixed-income market has enormous potential to redirect global capital towards addressing 
climate-related challenges. Estimated to hold about USD123 trillion of assets as of the end of 2020, 
with annual long-term issuances of about USD 27 trillion (SIFMA, 2021), fixed-income securities 
can go a long way towards meeting the capital requirements of the global energy transition. 
Already a widely known instrument in the financial industry, green bonds have experienced 
significant growth over the past decade (about 103% a year in 2011-2021), increasing from about 
USD 800 million of issuances in 2007 to about USD 545 billion of issuances in 2021 – an all-time 
annual high despite pandemic-induced economic challenges. The cumulative value of green bond 
issuances broke the USD 1 trillion threshold at the end of 2020 and stood at about USD 1.64 trillion 
as of the end of 2021 (Environmental Finance, 2022b) (Figure 2.20). USD trillion

Figure 2.20 Green bonds’ cumulative issuances, 2007-2021
Source: Environmental Finance (2022b)In addition to the growth in the amount of capital raised, the green bond market has greatly 
diversified in terms of types of issuers, markets’ geographic reach, as well as the number of useof-proceeds categories. Early on, green bonds were almost entirely supported by development 
banks, such as the European Investment Bank and the International Financial Corporation, which 
remain important in regions new to green bonds. But the instrument quickly evolved. Corporates 
now dominate issuances (accounting for 37% of cumulative issuances in 2007-2021), followed 
by financial institutions (22%), agencies (17%), sovereigns (10%), development banks (8%) and 
municipal issuers (7%). In terms of its geographic reach, the growth in Asia-Pacific has been 
particularly strong; the region now ranks second in terms of overall cumulative issuances (23% in 
2007-2021) – ahead of North America (22%), but behind Europe (45%). 
Renewable energy continues to dominate the use-of-proceeds categories for green bonds. About 
62% of all green bond issuances (in USD, 2007-2021) include renewable energy, while about 15% 
of green bonds are earmarked solely for renewable energy, followed by green buildings (11%) and 
clean transport (5%) (Environmental Finance, 2022b). 
In addition to green bonds, other forms of sustainable fixed-income offerings are becoming 
increasingly common in the financial market. Green, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked 
bonds (GSSS bonds) reached a cumulative value of about USD 2.6 trillion as of the end of 2021. 
Green bonds account for the largest share of the market (63% of cumulative issuances), followed 
by social bonds (17%), sustainable bonds (16%) and sustainability-linked bonds (4%). In terms 
of annual issuances, green bonds recorded USD 545 billion in 2021, followed by USD 207 billion 
worth of issuances for social bonds, USD 190 billion for sustainable bonds, USD 92 billion for 
sustainability-linked bonds and another USD 2 billion for bonds that span multiple GSSS categories 
(Figure 2.21). This represented an annual record for the GSSS market, which grew by 74% from 
2020 to 2021 (Environmental Finance, 2022b). 
Even in emerging and developing markets the growth has been surprisingly positive. While they 
still lag behind the annual and cumulative issuances of developed economies of Europe, AsiaPacific (mostly China) and the Americas, issuances of GSSS bonds in emerging and developing 
economies reached USD 159 billion, nearly triple the 2020 volume (Amundi and IFC, 2022). Social bonds are intended to finance activities that support positive social outcomes, such as 
affordable housing and access to essential services, including basic infrastructure and food 
security. Sometimes aligned with the Social Bond Principles of the International Capital Markets 
Association (ICMA), social bonds are often aimed at disadvantaged segments of the population 
– those living below the poverty line, minorities, displaced persons and people with disabilities, 
among others. Over 2 900 social bonds had been issued by the end of 2021, with an estimated 
value of about USD 427 billion, predominantly by development and multilateral banks, such as 
the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, New Development Bank and International Finance Corporation (Environmental 
Finance, 2022b). Among countries, France in particular has been active in this segment with 
large issuances from banks, such as Société Générale and Crédit Agricole, for example, as well 
as its government agencies, such as Unédic, the  French  unemployment agency, and Caisse 
d’Amortissement de la Dette Sociale (CADES) that issues social bonds to help finance the French 
social security system (NatWest, 2022). USD trillion

Note: “Multiple GSSS” refers to bonds deemed to belong to multiple GSSS categories at the same time (i.e. green and social bond, 
social and sustainability-linked bond, etc.) 
Source: Environmental Finance (2022b).In the past few years, COVID-related bonds have focused on those most negatively affected by 
the pandemic. A notable example is the European Commission’s issuance of social bonds under 
the Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) programme, intended to 
support short-term employment schemes in EU member states. From October 2020 until May 
2021, the Commission issued EUR 89.64 billion of social bonds in seven issuances, making this 
the world’s largest social bond scheme, with plans for further issuances up to the total limit of 
EUR 100 billion (EU, 2022). 
Sustainability bonds typically finance activities that support both social and green outcomes 
and are aligned with ICMA’s Sustainability Bond Guidelines. Over 2 700 sustainability bonds were 
issued by the end of 2021, with an estimated value of about USD  405  billion (Environmental 
Finance, 2022b). The most common issuers are development banks, in particular the International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the lending arm of the World Bank Group), the 
European Investment Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (Environmental Finance, 
2022b). Among countries, the United States is particularly active in this segment, mostly through 
government agencies, such as the New York State Housing Finance Agency, which has issued 
sustainability bonds to raise capital for the development of affordable housing in the state. 
Sustainability-linked bonds link the bond’s coupon (annual or semi-annual fixed payment to the 
bond holder) to the issuer’s achievement of selected sustainability goals. For example, the issuer 
may set a target to lower its greenhouse gas emissions, its water use or its waste, by a certain 
percentage as of a specific deadline, and in the event the target is not achieved the coupon payment 
is increased by a pre-specified amount. Italian energy producer Enel issued the first sustainabilitylinked bond in 2019 (raising USD 1.5 billion from institutional investors), which had a condition that 
Enel would meet a target of having 55% of its installed electricity capacity supplied by renewables 
by 2021; if the target went unmet, the coupon was to increase by 25 basis points (or 0.25%) (Enel, 
2019). Almost entirely issued by corporations and as a relatively new addition to the GSSS market, 
sustainability-linked bonds have just crossed the USD 100 billion threshold in terms of cumulative 
notional spread over 190 issuances as of the end of 2021 (Environmental Finance, 2022b). 
In addition to long-term fixed-income market instruments like GSSS bonds and loans, short-term 
debt instruments present another capital pool that can help finance the energy transition. Valued 
at about USD 55 trillion globally, short-term debt can be used for pre-financing or the operating 
expenditures of companies and includes instruments such as credit facilities, short-term bank 
loans, export finance and letters of credit, among others (CBI, 2022).Growing the GSSS market further requires co-ordinated actions and supportive policies to 
accelerate the momentum of green finance. These include: 
• Sustained government support and incentivisation of sustainable finance initiatives, such as 
clear and long-term climate-aligned programmes and budgets, provision of financial help to 
cover higher transaction costs incurred by the issuers of green instruments and lower capital 
requirements for green debt/loans, as well as having government bodies themselves actively 
issue green debt instruments of various forms. 
• Continuous active involvement by development banks in kick-starting GSSS bonds in 
markets where their issuances are still lagging, via demonstration issuances, co-issuances 
and provision of seed capital, as well as provision of financial and technical assistance to new 
GSSS issuers. For development banks to de-risk projects using risk mitigation instruments 
continues to be crucially important to help build a pipeline of bankable green assets. 
• Greater efforts among industry participants to adopt rigorous and best practices in the 
issuance of GSSS instruments, including third-party verification and certification, proper 
ring-fencing of the capital raised, and reporting on capital u se and environmental/social 
benefits.2.5 Investments by source
In 2020, the private sector continued to provide the lion’s share of investments in renewable 
energy, committing USD 240 billion (or 69% of the global total), a 7% increase compared to 2019. 
Public-sector finance provided USD 108 billion in the same year (31% of the total), 2% less than in 
2017-2019 (Figure 2.22).
The global share of public versus private investments varies by technology. Typically, lower 
shares of public finance are devoted to renewable energy technologies that are commercially 
viable and highly competitive, which makes them more attractive for private investors. Thanks 
to supportive policies, in 2020, solar PV was able to attract private finance amounting to 83% 
of total commitments (Figure 2.23). A relatively high share (72%) of private participation was 
also found in bioenergy (i.e. biomass and biofuels). Although more than 60% of onshore and 
offshore wind is financed by private investors, public finance continues to play a large role in 
promoting these technologies. One possible explanation for this trend is the concentration of 
wind investment in China, most of it from state-owned financial institutions and state-owned 
enterprises (Section 2.5.2). 
At the other end of the spectrum, geothermal and hydropower receive the largest shares of 
public finance; only 32% and 3% of investments, respectively, came from private investors in 
2020. A larger need for public finance in hydropower is linked to large upfront investments (over 
a billion dollars), high construction risks, the need for long-tenor loans (as projects can take over a 
decade to complete), complex and lengthy permitting procedures, and high costs and social and 
environmental risks, all of which can significantly hamper the ability of private sector investments 
to finance large hydropower projects (IRENA, 2023b).

Source: CPI (2022a).2.5.1 Private investments
In 2020, commercial financial institutions and corporations continued to be the main private 
sector providers, together accounting for 85% of total private finance for renewables. In absolute 
amounts, commercial financial institutions committed USD 104 billion (6% more than in 2019), 
while corporations invested USD  99  billion (up 7%). Up until 2018, private investments came 
predominantly from corporations (on average, 65% during 2013-2018), but in 2019 and 2020 
corporations’ share decreased to 41% per year, while a higher share of investments was filled 
by commercial financial institutions (43%) (Figure 2.24). This was mainly due to a rise in these 
institutions’ commitments to onshore wind and solar PV in the United States and onshore wind in 
China, coupled with a drop in commitments made by corporations in solar PV in China. 
Households and individuals accounted for 13% of private renewable energy investments, 
providing USD  32  billion per year in 2020 (up from USD  26  billion in 2019). Investments by 
households and individuals were concentrated on solar PV (85% in 2020) with the rest being 
invested primarily in solar water heaters (15%). Households in many countries are increasingly 
favouring rooftop solar PV systems, driven by the falling costs of solar PV, and high and/or rising 
residential electricity prices (Taylor, 2022). In Australia, for instance, more than 30% of all homes 
had installed a rooftop solar PV system with 3 million systems installed countrywide by early 
2022 (Government of Australia, 2022). The country now has the highest solar PV capacity per 
capita, globally (IRENA, 2022d; World Bank, n.d.).

renewable energy. In 2020, they provided close to one-third of total renewable energy financing 
for end uses, with the remaining two-thirds being provided by governments and corporations. 
The role of institutional investors11 in providing direct financing for new renewable energy 
assets remained limited. In 2020, they accounted, on average, for only 1% of private investments 
in renewables, providing USD  2.5  billion. This represented a 26% increase compared to 2019 
(USD 2 billion), but a 41% drop over the average USD 4.3 billion invested in 2017-2018. 
When investing in renewables, institutional investors generally show a preference for more 
established technologies such as solar PV and onshore wind – which, together, accounted for 74% 
and 84% of their investments in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Over half of the investments made 
in the two years 2019-2020 was concentrated in the United States (USD 1.3 billion), followed by 
China (USD 495 million) and Sweden (USD 334 million). Box 2.3 provides a deep dive analysis 
into the role of institutional investors and funds in driving private finance into the renewable
energy sector.

11 Institutional investors here include pension funds, insurance companies, endowments and foundations, sovereign wealth funds, 
asset managers and investment companies; this differs from the definition used in Box 24The Netherlands feed-in premiums scheme and energy tax exemption for renewable energy 
generators have also prompted rapid growth in the industry, which led the continent in offshore 
wind investment in 2020 (Climatescope, 2022b). Germany has also chosen to pursue a FiT and 
national and state grants to accelerate growth in renewable energy generation (BNEF, 2022d).
Across the continent, net-zero commitments and extensive policies to phase out fossil fuels are 
driving growth in renewable energy. The Green New Deal commits members of the European 
Union (EU) to reducing net emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 (European 
Commission, 2022). Building on this, the European Commission presented a Green Deal Industrial 
Plan for the Net-Zero Age in February 2023, which would provide investment aid and tax breaks 
towards technological development, manufacturing, production and installation of net-zero 
products in green sectors including renewables and hydrogen (Bloomberg, 2023; European 
Commission, 2023). The plan looks to mobilise EUR 225 billion in loans from its existing Recovery 
and Resilience Facility, and an additional EUR 20 billion in grants (European Commission, 2023).
The plan came soon after the announcement of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act in the United 
States, as Europe looks to stay competitive in the net-zero age. 
A 
forthcoming Net-Zero Industry Act seeks to streamline permitting processes, with the view to 
speed development and reduce costs. After a rocky start, the European Emission Trading scheme 
provides the largest and one of the most functional cap-and-trade systems of any economic bloc.
The success of the energy transition depends on the renewable energy sector’s ability to attract capital flows 
in unprecedented amounts. Institutional investorsa
 in particular can play a pivotal role in this regard. 
While already vast, the asset base of institutional investors continues to grow, thanks largely to the growth of 
stock markets over the past few years. IRENA’s (2020) analysis of over 5 800 investors belonging to a “core” 
group, composed of pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments and 
foundations, estimated their assets at about USD 87 trillion (2018-2019 average) (IRENA, 2020c). This number 
has since grown by about USD 20 trillion to reach USD 107 trillion. Pension plans are estimated to have grown 
their assets from USD 44 trillion in 2018-2019 (annual average) to about USD 56.5 trillion in 2021 (Thinking 
Ahead Institute, 2019, 2022). Insurance assets grew from USD 33 trillion in 2018-2019 to about USD 40 trillion 
in 2020 (Statista, 2022; Thinking Ahead Institute, 2019). Similarly, the 100 largest sovereign wealth funds 
grew from USD 8 trillion in 2018-2019 to about USD 10 trillion as of mid-2022 (SWFI, 2022). Endowments and 
foundations hold another USD 1.2 trillion of assets (SWFI, 2022). 
In terms of their direct financing of renewable energy projects, however, activities of the “core” group of 
institutional investors remained relatively subdued. While annual investment in renewable energy projects has 
hit one record high after another over the past few years, reaching USD 347 billion in 2020 and an estimated 
USD  417  billion in 2021, direct institutional investments into renewable energy projects hovered at about 
USD 1 billion per year in the 2013-2020 period – less than 1% of the total investment (see Figure 2.25). 
Analysis of institutional investors’ behaviour in relation to renewables-based projects reveals a continued 
preference for “tried and tested” modes of operation. Most institutional investments flow into the developed 
markets of North America (an average 31% of all institutional investments in renewable projects over
2013-2020), Europe (27%), and East Asia and Pacific (14%), where the real or perceived risks are lower. Such 
investors continue to seek large transaction sizes to lower their overall transaction costs. These are most often 
delivered via wind projects (average of 34% for onshore wind and 9% for offshore wind over 2013-2020), 
followed by solar PV (28%). In terms of investment instruments deployed by institutional investors for direct 
asset financing, project-level debt is their preferred mode (43% of institutional investments over 2013-2020), 
followed by project-level equity (33%).

Figure 2.25 Annual financial commitment in renewable energy projects made by institutional investors, 
2013-2020
Source: CPI (2022a).2.5.2 Public investments
To date, only a handful of public financial institutions have committed to aligning their investments 
with the Paris Agreement. A recent report (CPI, 2022c) analysed the 70 largest public financial 
institutions representing 95% of the total assets held by public financial institutions (equivalent 
to USD 20.4 trillion). The report found that only 20 such institutions have set net-zero targets. 
National and subnational development banks, in particular, lag behind their peers in terms of 
setting climate finance targets.
Institutional investors continue to be far more active in the refinancing and acquisition stages of existing 
renewable energy assets, achieved via instruments like listed common stock shares, bonds (including green 
and other GSSS [green, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked] bonds, discussed in Box 2.3) or fund 
shares, to name a few. While refinancing does not provide investment for a new asset, it is still important 
for the renewables markets as it helps original financiers “recycle” their capital into new renewable projects 
and may also reduce their overall financing costs. Institutional investors have increased their activities in 
this later funding stage, accounting for nearly one-quarter of energy project acquisitions and financing in 
2019, compared to less than one-fifth in 2010. For renewable energy in particular, this translates to about 
USD 12 billion invested in 2019 (IEA, 2020). Examples include refinancing of the 588 megawatts (MW) Beatrice 
offshore wind farm in the United Kingdom and the acquisition of the 402 MW Veja Mate offshore wind farm 
in Germany (IEA, 2020).
The case for institutional investors to increase their focus on renewable energy investments remains strong 
and increasingly urgent. Many institutional investors have committed to aligning their assets with global 
climate targets via a growing number of global alliances, such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero 
(GFANZ), for example. Renewables continue to hold other important benefits for such investors. In the context 
of a global economic slowdown, the importance of asset diversification becomes more pronounced, as do 
concerns about reducing volatility and uncertainty related to fossil fuel prices. Also, the need to preserve 
long-term value for asset holders through sustainable investments and to address growing public scrutiny of 
actions to mitigate climate change will only become more pressing over time. 
Ramping up institutional investments in renewables continues to depend on lowering barriers to entry to this 
segment and on co-ordinated action among involved stakeholders. Priorities include: 
• Policy makers’ continued and transparent support of the integration of renewable energy in overall 
development and sustainability targets. 
• Improved provision of risk mitigation solutions for regions that continue to be seen as high risk. Public 
capital providers, such as development finance institutions, can play an important role in this regard. 
• Adoption of co-financing and blended finance structures that allow for the sharing of know-how and that 
can also reduce the cost of financing in new markets. 
• Continuous creation of bankable green asset pipelines and truly green market instruments that can 
channel institutional capital towards renewable assets (e.g. listed equities, indices, funds and fixed income 
instruments) containing more green (sustainable or ESG [environmental, social and governance]) assets.
• Development of internal expertise for direct investment in projects or indirect investment through green 
instruments, considering the overall impact of climate change on portfolios.
a The analysis in this box looks at a “core” group of institutional investors composed of pension funds, 
insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments and foundations. It excludes asset managers 
and insurance companies.In 2020, public investments in renewable energy assets totalled USD 108 billion (31% of all 
investments), up 4% from 2019 (Figure 2.26). Given that the majority of renewable energy 
investments are made domestically (Section 2.3), and in the absence of any meaningful
international collaboration despite pledges such as the USD 100 billion a year made in international 
forums, it is not surprising that state-owned financial institutions (SOFIs), national DFIs and stateowned enterprises (SOEs) were the main sources of public finance for renewables. 
Funding from governments remained stable at USD 6.5 billion in 2020, or 6% of total public 
finance for renewables. Over half of this (55%) was invested domestically in China for solar water 
heaters. While governments are not among the main providers of capital for new renewable 
energy assets, much of their spending goes to fund renewable energy support schemes such as 
grants and subsidies. This is in addition to the regulated payments – or public PPAs – that are 
used as the main procurement method in some cases, and that are needed to address inadequate 
organisational structures (marginal pricing) – both of which are topics beyond the scope of this 
analysis.12 Looking at the lifetime public expenditure for PPAs, FiTs, feed-in premiums (FiPs), 
contract for difference (CfD) schemes, etc. would give a more holistic view of governments’ role 
in supporting the deployment of renewables, especially when the tariffs paid to producers – in 
addition to the cost of running the system - are lower than what is collected by consumers and 
the difference is paid through a government subsidy (see Section 4.4).

please see the Methodology document (Appendix)In 2020, state-owned financial institutions (SOFIs) provided, on average, USD 52 billion (or 48% 
of total public finance), increasing their commitments by 35% compared to 2019. About 83% of 
investments from these institutions in 2020 was directed towards projects in China, primarily for 
onshore wind (42%), solar PV (22%) and offshore wind (19%).
Commitments from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) recorded a steep decline in 2019 and 2020, 
reaching USD 11 billion per year (10% of total public financing), down by 53% compared to the 
average USD 23 billion invested annually in 2017-2018. Similar to SOFIs, SOEs provided capital 
almost exclusively for onshore wind (40%, mainly invested in China), offshore wind (30%, mainly 
in the Netherlands) and solar PV (29%, mainly in China).
National DFIs were the second-largest source of public investment in 2020, providing 25% of the 
total (or USD 27 billion). Their investments focused on onshore wind projects (49%), hydropower 
(26%) and solar PV (16%). China Development Bank, alone, accounted for over 90% of the total 
in 2020, investing primarily in China. National DFIs were the single-largest provider of finance for 
hydropower projects, accounting for 65% of cumulative investments in this technology during 
2013-2020, and 81% of annual investments in 2020. This trend was largely driven by the China 
Development Bank, which committed USD 5.2 billion and USD 6.9 billion for hydropower projects 
in 2019 and 2020, respectively, 90% of which were located in China. 
Multilateral DFIs provided USD 9.4 billion in 2020 (or 9% of total public finance) – in line with 
their past annual commitments, which fluctuated between USD 8.7 billion and USD 10.7 billion 
during 2015-2019. These institutions were a key provider of international finance, accounting for 
about half of international flows coming from the public sector. 
Commitments from bilateral DFIs in 2020 fell 70% compared to 2019, moving from USD 7.5 billion 
to USD 2.3 billion. This decline is largely attributable to a 96% decline in international commitments 
by the German Development Bank (KfW). This drop is remarkable, especially given the need for 
a steep increase in international collaboration to achieve a just transition (see Chapter 4). Instead, 
the world is facing a decline even of debt financing (which requires repayment and involves 
interest rates on top of that).
Governments and international donors play major roles in enabling investments in renewables, 
especially in developing countries, where real or perceived risks contribute to the high cost 
of financing or prevent projects from seeing the light of day. In fact, multilateral and bilateral 
DFIs together accounted for only USD 11.7 billion in 2020. Since grants and concessional loans 
amounted to 1% of the total renewable energy finance equivalent to USD 5 billion (Section 2.4), 
this means that even if all concessional financing were to be provided by DFIs, less than half of 
these funds had positive impacts on the beneficiaries, whereas for more than half, interest rates 
were as high as the rest of the market. Since the interest rates are the same, the only difference 
that public financing provides is making finance available, but at the same high costs for users. 
Figure 2.27 illustrates the portion of DFI funding provided in the form of grants and low-cost debt.The strategic use of public finance remains key for delivering projects that are essential for socioeconomic development in contexts where private investors do not venture. Such use of public 
finance also helps create an enabling environment for private investors in areas where they are 
active, by developing infrastructure and addressing the risks and barriers that deter private 
capital. In addition, public funding is needed to implement policies – capacity-building, education, 
retraining and industrial – that would ensure a just and inclusive energy transition (see Chapter 4). 
International flows of public finance to the Global South are essential to the 1.5°C Scenario and 
related socio-economic goals (along with progressive fiscal measures and other government 
programmes such as distributional policy) (IRENA, 2022a). However, international flows of public 
finance have been in decline since 2018. Box 2.4 provides a deep dive into international public 
finance flows to developing countries in support of renewable energy, as tracked by IRENA and 
the OECD.13

13 IRENA and the OECD have been appointed to track annual progress towards SDG indicator 7.a.1 on “measuring international financial 
flows to developing countries in support of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in 
hybrid systems”Data for 2020 will be presented in the upcoming report Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report 2023International public financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy decreased in 2019 for 
the second year in a row, falling to USD 10.9 billion. This level of support was 23% less than the USD 14.2 billion 
provided in 2018, 25% less than the 2010-2019 average, and less than half of the peak of USD 24.7 billion in 
2017. Except for large fluctuations in 2016 for solar energy and 2017 for hydropower, flows have remained 
within the range of USD 10-16 billion per year since 2010 (Figure 2.28). A five-year moving average trend 
shows that average annual commitments decreased for the first time since 2008 by 5.5%, from USD 17.5 billion 
in 2014-2018 to USD 16.6 billion in 2015-2019. The level of financing remains below what is needed to reach 
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, in particular for the least-developed countries (LDCs), landlocked 
developing countries and small-island developing states.
Geographically, most regions saw a decrease in international public flows in 2019. Flows increased only in 
Oceania, where they rose by 72% (USD 55.1 million). Decreases were less significant in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
where they fell 1.7% to USD  4.0  billion. Flows to Western Asia and Northern Africa decreased by 22% to 
USD 1.8 billion. The bulk of decreases were concentrated in Eastern and Southeastern Asia, where they fell 
66%; Latin America and the Caribbean, where they dropped by 29.8%; and Central and Southern Asia, where 
they declined by 24.5%.

Figure 2.28 Annual international public financial commitments to developing countries in support of 
renewable energy production, and research and development, by region, 2000-2019
Notes: Multiple/other renewables include commitments whose descriptions are unclear in the financial databases; 
commitments that target more than one technology with no details specifying the financial breakdown for each; bioenergy 
commitments, which are almost negligible; multi-purpose financial instruments such as green bonds and investment 
funds; and commitments targeting a broad range of technologies. Examples of the latter include renewable energy 
and electrification programmes, technical assistance activities, energy efficiency programmes and other infrastructure 
supporting renewable energy.
Source: IEA, IRENA, et al. (2022).In 2019, 24 countries received 80% of all commitments. Nigeria, Guinea and India were the top recipients, 
attracting one-quarter of total commitments. Guinea was also a top recipient in 2018, thanks to a USD 1.1 billion 
commitment to the Souapiti Hydro Project.
It is also important to highlight the difference in flows directed to emerging markets in developing countries 
and those furthest behind, as categorised by the United Nations. In 2021, the same countries belonged to 
the groups of LDCs, landlocked developing countries and small-island developing states, but commitments 
directed to these countries varied widely by group (Figure 2.29). The LDCs received 25.2% of commitments 
in 2019, an increase from 21% in 2018, continuing an upward trend since 2016 but masking a 9% decrease from 
USD 3.0 billion to USD 2.7 billion in absolute amounts. Among the 46 LDCs, São Tomé and Príncipe, Eritrea and 
Kiribati were the only ones that did not receive any flows in 2019. Chad and Timor-Leste did receive funding in 
2019, after receiving no commitments in 2018.

Source: IEA, IRENA, et al. (2022)..Public funding for renewable energy has endured many challenges in recent years in a deteriorating 
global economic context. Figure 2.30 shows the growing proportion of countries in debt distress, 
or at high risk of debt distress in recent years. A combination of high public debt, inflation and 
slow growth is affecting both developed countries and emerging economies. Policy responses 
to those challenges will impact countries and the global financial markets’ ability to address the 
ever-growing climate financing needs. As such, this new paradigm requires revisiting the role of 
public funds, including international flows, to achieve a just and inclusive energy transition. 
Given the urgent need to step up the pace and geographic spread of the energy transition, 
and to capture its full potential in achieving socio-economic development goals, more flows of 
international funds are needed that help underinvested countries reap the benefits of the energy 
transition without putting their fiscally constrained economies at a further disadvantage (see 
Sections 4.5 and 4.6).

OFF-GRID RENEWABLE 
ENERGY INVESTMENT IN 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES03
Modern energy access is a key pillar of a just and inclusive energy transition given its central 
role in meeting the Sustainable Development Goal 7 on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, 
sustainable and modern energy for all (SDG 7) and contributing towards all other SDGs. However, 
despite progress in energy access, approximately 733 million people had no access to electricity 
and nearly 2.4 billion people relied on traditional fuels and technologies for cooking at the end 
of 2020. 
Moreover, the world is not on track to achieve universal energy access by 2030. Nearly 670 million 
are expected to be without electricity and 2.1 billion without access to clean cooking under current 
and planned policies (IEA, IRENA, et al. 2022). Scaling up investments and policy support in the 
off-grid renewables sector will be crucial to closing the access deficit.
Off-grid renewable energy technologies – both stand-alone systems and mini-grids – can be a 
cost-effective solution to accelerate electricity access for households and businesses especially in 
contexts with inadequate power and grid infrastructure. From 2012 to 2021, the population served 
by off-grid renewables increased from 35 million to 213 million, as seen in Figure 3.1, generating a 
range of socio-economic and environmental benefits (IRENA, 2022g). In 2020-2021, the number 
of people served by off-grid solutions reported a decrease primarily driven by improving grid 
access rates in South Asia (particularly India and Bangladesh) and reduced replacement rates for 
solar light and solar home systems (SHSs) due to COVID-19. Conversely, the adoption of off-grid 
solutions in Africa continued to increase during this period along with investments in the sector. 
This chapter provides an in-depth analysis of off-grid renewable energy investments in developing 
and emerging economies, analysing trends across technologies, countries, types of investors 
and financial instruments. It is important to note that the data in this chapter refer mainly to 
commitments made to enterprises operating in the off-grid renewable energy sector delivering 
electricity access solutions. Investments going into training, capacity building, planning exercises, 
grants for end users, etc. are covered to a very limited extent, although they make a substantial 
and important portion of the energy access financing landscape (see Box 3.4).3.1 Overview of the off-grid financing landscape
Between 2010 and 2021, the off-grid renewables sector attracted more than USD 3 billion (Wood 
Mackenzie, 2022a).1
 Although off-grid renewable energy investments still represent a small portion 
of the overall energy access financing landscape, they are a crucial, and cost-effective, piece in the 
access puzzle. They have the potential to bring new electricity access to almost 580 million people 
by 2030 (UN, 2021). In recent years (2013-2019), they consistently made up less than 1% of the overall 
USD212 billion committed to the electricity sector in the 20 countries with the greatest access deficit2
(SEforAll, 2021), yet have enabled access for over 200 million people in developing countries globally.
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout, annual investments in off-grid renewable 
energy reached a record high of USD 558 million in 2021, as shown in Figure 3.2 (Wood Mackenzie, 
2022a). Recent growth has been driven by investments in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in 
East Africa, and more recently in West Africa. However, current investment levels fall far short of 
the USD 2.3 billion required annually in off-grid solar products alone (not including mini-grids) 
between 2021 and 2030 (ESMAP et al. 2022a).3 Millions of people

1 These data mainly cover corporate flows. Other flows such as those going into training, capacity building, planning exercises, grants 
for end users, etc. are covered to a very limited extent, although they compose a substantial portion of the energy access financing 
landscape.
2 Together, these countries host more than 80 percent of people without electricity access globally (SEforAll, 2021). At the time of this 
analysis, these countries consisted of: Angola, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, 
Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda 
and the United Republic of Tanzania (SEforAll, 2021).Off-grid renewable energy investments in Africa showed strong resilience to the disruptions 
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposed companies to a range of financial and 
operational risks. Supply chain disruptions had an inflationary impact on consumer prices via a 
sector-wide increase in manufacturing and distribution costs, particularly for SHSs. At the same 
time, pandemic-related economic impacts depressed household incomes (ESMAP et al. 2022b). 
Many customers defaulted on their bills, leaving companies to find new ways to secure cash flows 
while a significant portion of their capital was locked in receivables (IRENA, 2022f). Despite these 
challenges, Africa showed strong signs of recovery to record-high levels of investments in 2021, 
while investments in other regions have yet to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels.
Globally, off-grid renewable investments are increasingly skewed towards seven large incumbent 
companies that have already reached scale and are looking to further solidify their market 
position through their ability to attract capital. This demonstrates that the sector is maturing and 
unlocking financing that can support scale. But the growth in early-stage enterprise financing 
has halted since 2020, with equity financing particularly difficult to attract (ESMAP et al. 2022b).
A diverse set of investors has entered the investment landscape over the past several years, 
including private equity, impact investors, institutional investors (mainly foundations) and 
development finance institutions (DFIs). Yet the overwhelming majority of investments continue 
to originate from only a few major players. For instance, since 2017, investments have increased 
but are now spread out over fewer transactions. The average transaction size gradually climbed 
from USD 1.1 million to 1.7 million by 2020, before more than doubling to USD 3.7 million in 2021 
(Figure 3.2). While a trend of growing ticket size is a sign of sector growth and maturity, it may 
also indicate existing challenges for enterprises looking for smaller investments.

Figure 3.3 Landscape of off-grid renewable energy finance, 2010-2021 (USD million)3.2 Off-grid renewable energy investments by energy use and product
3.2.1 Investments by energy use
Between 2010 and 2021 the majority of investments went to residential applications, although 
the share going to commercial and industrial (C&I) applications has been expanding over time. 
To date, residential applications attracted 54% of cumulative investment or USD  1.7  billion of 
overall investments during 2010-2021, followed by C&I applications which took another 14% 
(USD 444 million) during the same period (Figure 3.4). Sub-Saharan Africa attracted more than 
80% of the investments in both categories as this is where the largest access deficit lies, and 
where the demand for off-grid services is the greatest for both residential and commercial uses.
The share of investments going only to C&I applications expanded from 8% in 2015 to 32% in 
2021 (Figure 3.4), given the growing needs of off-grid populations from basic household access 
through solar lights and solar lanterns to more energy-intensive uses in local industry, mining 
and agriculture. Powering C&I applications can promote local economies by creating jobs and 
spurring economic growth, while also enhancing food security and resilience against the impacts 
of climate variability on agri-food chains (IRENA, 2016b).
The share of investments for residential purposes declined substantially from 59% in 2020 to 
25% in 2021. At the same time, multi-purpose investments (i.e. investments supporting a mix of 
residential, C&I or community-based and other related economic activities) increased threefold, 
mainly focused on a few large off-grid companies that are looking to further scale-up while 
diversifying their operations further upstream to reach new market segments (e.g. C&I customers 
and powering local clinics and schools) or geographies. This expansion of services partly explains 
the declining share of investments going only in the residential sector in 2021. For example, 
Zola Electric expanded its customer base to more than 300 000 homes and businesses across 
Africa. In 2021, the company raised another USD 90 million to finance product development and 
expansion into new markets across Africa (Kene-Okafor, 2021). 
Off-grid technologies that power communities and their economic activities (e.g. streetlights 
and power for schools and hospitals) accounted for 3% of cumulative commitments towards offgrid renewables in 2010-2021. As with the residential sector, community-focused investments are 
increasingly being absorbed by investments for multiple purposes. 
Finally, support infrastructure and services have grown in recent years, attracting 3.5% of total 
investment. This is a broadly defined category that includes investments in all ancillary products 
and services – including storage systems, smart meters, voltage converters, software services 
and data platforms – as well as research and development (R&D). It also includes investments in 
financial products or innovations designed to serve the off-grid renewable energy sector. Previous innovations in support infrastructure and services such as Internet of Things (IoT) 
enabled technologies (e.g. smart meters), blockchain and pay-as-you-go (PAYG) business 
models have helped further reduce costs, improve reliability and expand the range of electricity 
services provided. In 2021, this included a USD 30 million investment in an innovative artificial 
intelligence (AI)–enabled energy financing platform called Nithio FI. The platform collects
essential information, including consumer repayment data, to standardise credit risk assessments, 
inform due diligence and enhance portfolio and impact monitoring (UNDP, 2022). It mobilises
off-grid solar financing at scale through its financial intermediary, Nithio FI B.V., to households, 
micro businesses and smallholder farmers (PR Newswire, 2021).

3.2.2 Investments by energy products and service
Solar photovoltaic (PV) products continued to dominate the off-grid space, attracting 92% of 
overall investments in 2010-2021. Owing to their modular and distributed characteristics, solar PV 
technologies can be adapted to a wide variety of off-grid applications (IRENA, 2018a). Bioenergy 
and mini/micro hydropower together make up USD 60 million of commitments made to date 
(totalling more than USD 3 billion – so less than 2%), distributed among countries across East 
Africa (mainly Rwanda for bioenergy), South Asia and Southeast Asia.4 SHSs attracted USD 1.74 billion between 2010 and 2021 and are the most funded technology 
(as seen in Figure 3.5). Their ability to provide reliable access that goes beyond lighting to 
power appliances such as fans, televisions, refrigerators and others, makes them important for 
households. Almost 90% of investment in SHSs has gone to residential uses (Figure 3.5). The 
remaining has gone to C&I applications and less-energy-intensive community uses, which involve 
energy access for schools, local clinics and information centres.
The widespread deployment of SHSs is enabled by the success of the PAYG (lease-based) 
financing model that helps low-income consumers avoid the upfront costs and risks of investing 
in solar home systems and appliances (see Box 3.1). This in turn has enabled off-grid renewable 
energy companies to further scale up their services to a larger pool of customers looking to 
secure reliable and affordable electricity while monetising PAYG-based sales to address their 
own funding needs. Meanwhile, investments in micro/mini-grids (mainly for commercial and 
residential applications) have also been supported through favourable regulatory frameworks 
and policy support.
Micro- and mini-grids garnered USD 648 million in investments between 2010 and 2021 
(Figure 3.5). According to the World Bank’s Multi-Tier Framework for measuring energy access,5
micro- and mini-grids can simultaneously supply many homes and buildings with an adequate 
level of energy access (up to Tier 5). Because these products are relatively capital intensive, their 
commercial viability requires additional demand from C&I and community-based applications on 
top of less energy intensive residential uses. This explains why a large share of these investments 
are going to either stand-alone C&I applications (39% of the total) or multiple applications which 
include C&I customers (46% of the total).6
Other off-grid solar products accounted for USD 43 million in commitments between 2010 
and 2021. More than two-thirds went to C&I applications e.g. to solar water pumps for irrigation 
purposes. Solar refrigerators – used by small businesses such as barber shops and restaurants 
– and solar water heaters (e.g. for use in hotels in Kenya) contributed to a few small deals in 
recent years (Solar Thermal World, 2017). Investments going to off-grid solar products for
wider community-based uses accounted for 8% of overall investments between 2010-2021. 
This primarily consisted of solar streetlights and solar kiosks, targeting communities without
electricity access.
5 Instead of the binary definition of access that is widely employed today, the Multi-Tier Framework redefines energy access to 
encompass a complex spectrum of availability, capacity, reliability, quality, affordability, formality and health and safety.
The framework ranks access to electricity from Tier 0 to Tier 5 across these dimensions (ESMAP, n.d.)
6 Multiple refers to a combination of residential
C&I and community-based economic activities3.3 Off-grid renewable energy investments by region
3.3.1 Investments by region of destination
Sub-Saharan Africa remains the primary destination for investment in off-grid renewable 
investments. The region attracted at least USD  2.2  billion (equivalent to 71%) of the overall 
investments in 2010-2021. Electrification rates in these countries are among the lowest 
in the world, with 568 million people in the region lacking access to electricity in 2020
(IEA, IRENA et al. 2022). 
Within Sub-Saharan Africa, East Africa attracted 43% of the total cumulative investment, receiving 
USD 952 million. East Africa was home to three of the top five recipient countries, namely, Kenya, 
the United Republic of Tanzania and Rwanda. Investment in these destinations benefited 
from the existing mobile money ecosystem, which was leveraged by the PAYG business model 
(see Box 3.1). Approximately 78% of the total cumulative commitments in off-grid renewables in 
2010-2021 (or USD 2.4 billion) involved the funding of companies or projects using PAYG, with 
East Africa accounting for USD917million. USD million (constant 2020)

Figure 3.5 Annual investment in off-grid renewable energy, by off-grid product, and energy use, 2010-2021
Based on: Wood Mackenzie (2022a).A typical pay-as-you-go (PAYG) structure allows users to purchase a solar home system (SHS) with an initial 
down payment, followed by periodic payments ranging from six months to eight years. Payments are collected 
via mobile payment platforms, while smart meters and data analytics facilitate operation, monitoring and 
other after-sales services (IRENA, 2022f).
This allows consumers to shift the upfront costs of purchasing an off-grid energy system while avoiding risks 
such as system failure. At the same time, companies can generate predictable cash flows based on existing 
PAYG contracts. The PAYG model has helped address some of the affordability gaps in the sector, while 
enabling companies to service a large consumer base and attract financing.
A recent example of this is Brighter Life Kenya 1 Limited, which is the first large-scale demonstration of 
receivables-purchase financing in local currency in the sector (USDFC, n.d.). The USD 127 million off–balance 
sheet financing vehicle is designed to acquire PAYG SHS accounts receivables from d.light, an off-grid solar 
products provider operating across 70 countries and catering to more than 100 million people. Through d.light, 
the facility is expected to finance the provision of improved energy access to 1.9 million people in Kenya, 
create USD 88 million of additional income for the Kenyan economy and save 600 000 tonnes of greenhouse 
gas emissions. Public financing remains key in enabling such ventures as part of the facility was financed by 
a USD 20 million senior debt commitment from the US International Development Finance Corporation, with 
Norfund providing an additional USD 15 million (Norfund, 2021). 
Box 3.1 PAYG model to attract financing in the off-grid solar sector
In recent years, West Africa has begun closing the financing gap with East Africa (Figure 3.6). 
During 2018-2021, West Africa saw more investment than East Africa. With PAYG sales starting 
to surpass cash-based sales, the region is witnessing a growing ecosystem of local retailers and 
international companies (ESMAP et al. 2022b). Nigeria is driving this growth as the largest single 
recipient country both in Sub-Saharan Africa and globally, attracting USD  287  million during 
2010-2021. Aside from a large untapped market and rising diesel prices, this is linked to the 
implementation of the Nigeria Electrification Program by the Rural Electrification Agency with 
funding from the World Bank and the African Development Bank (ESMAP et al. 2022b) and 
a regulatory framework for mini-grids (see Box 3.2). Moreover, Burkina Faso and Mali (two 
conflict-affected states) have seen positive signs in their off-grid solar sector as governments 
and development partners are frequently supporting market development through subsidies and 
result-based financing mechanisms (ESMAP et al. 2022b).
Central and Southern Africa together attracted a total of USD 93 million during 2018-2021, as 
investments picked up over this period. Given the relative nascency of these two markets, public 
policy and development finance support remains crucial in driving investments. For example, 
Mozambique’s 50% off-grid electrification target (by 2030) has helped attract USD 13 million 
since 2017. Targeted grants and result-based financing initiatives such as the BRILHO programme 
(financed by the United Kingdom and Swedish Aid) have helped create an enabling regulatory 
environment, de-risk investments, helping to provide access to more than 306 000 people and 
5 000 small businesses through the deployment of SHSs, green mini-grids and improved cooking 
solutions (SNV, 2021). During the COVID-19 pandemic, off-grid renewable energy investments in Southeast Asia 
declined by 98%, leaving key off-grid markets even more vulnerable. Although the majority of 
countries in this region have achieved high or near-universal rates of electricity access, parts of 
the populations in countries such as Myanmar and Cambodia (26% and 15%, respectively in 2020) 
still lack access to electricity (World Bank, 2022). Whereas the region attracted USD 137 million in 
off-grid renewable energy investments over 2018-2019 (led primarily by Myanmar), during 2020-
2021, investments plummeted to USD 3 million, likely due to the negative impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic and political developments (ESMAP et al. 2022b). 
South Asia attracted USD 26 million in investments during 2018-2021, with India attracting more 
than 80% of all investments in the region. Of late, more investments are being mobilised for 
productive use of energy. Under its PM-KUSUM scheme (launched in 2019), the Indian government 
has incentivised the purchase and installation of over 152 000 solar water pumps as of October 
2022. Oorja, an Indian pay-per-use service based solar-powered irrigation, milling and cooling 
company, has attracted significant investments in recent years, including a USD 1 million seed 
funding round in 2021, with equity investment from Schneider Electric Energy Access Asia and 
grant funding from Water & Energy for Food Grand Challenge (WE4F). Oorja’s services are used 
by 15 000 farmers with potential for adoption by 130 million households in India alone. 
During 2018-2021, Latin America and the Caribbean7
, and the Middle East together attracted only 
USD 21 million, equivalent to less than 1.5% of cumulative commitments over that period. These 
regions have respectively achieved electricity access rates of more than 90% (World Bank, 2022).

Figure 3.6 Shares of annual investment in off-grid renewables by subregion of destination, 2015-2021 
Based on: Wood Mackenzie (2022a).
7 In figure 3.6, the Latin America and the Caribbean region consists of these sub-regions: Central America; South America; and the 
CaribbeanWith smaller shares of the population living in off-grid locations, these regions represent relatively 
small markets for decentralised energy systems.
Finally, the Pacific has received minimal investments, even though developing countries in this 
region, especially small island developing states, are prime candidates for off-grid services, 
particularly in remote areas where the costs of extending the main grid may be prohibitive. 
However, mini-grids and SHS solutions continue to lack access to economically financing options. 
Access to more patient and adaptable low-cost financing solutions is required to provide 
affordable energy access to implement these solutions at scale (Malhotra, 2022). 
Off-grid companies are gradually expanding their services across new geographies as the share 
of commitments going to multiple regions has grown from 12% in 2015 to 58% in 2021. Venturing 
into new markets is often a strategic step to capitalise on unexplored opportunities and harness 
further growth, while accelerating the achievement of universal access to electricity. 
Country-specific commitments were highly concentrated, with 12 countries accounting for 90% 
of these investments. The majority of these countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria and 
Kenya are the two countries attracting the largest off-grid investments globally (USD 287 million 
and USD 243 million, respectively) over 2010-2021. 
An enabling policy framework is crucial to attracting off-grid renewable energy investments. Figure 3.7 shows 
that countries with the highest “Regulatory Indicators for Sustainable Energy” (RISE) scores for electricity 
access in 2019 attracted the largest share of investments.8, 9 The RISE scores for electricity access encompass 
multidimensional aspects of electrification planning policies and regulations, including the scope of the 
officially approved electrification plan, a framework for mini-grids, a framework for stand-alone systems and 
consumer affordability of electricity (RISE, n.d.). 
By mid-2022, Nigeria and Kenya had some of the highest RISE scores for off-grid electricity access (86 and 83 
out of 100, respectively). This indicates that both countries have a relatively mature policy environment, even 
though there is still some room for improvement. For instance, Kenya had an objective of reaching universal 
electricity access by 2022, supported by its National Electrification Strategy, and has dedicated guidelines 
for mini-grids, which were published under the provisions of the 2006 Energy Act. A revised draft of these 
guidelines is in discussion and is expected to cover aspects such as tariff approval, licensing requirements, 
interconnection arrangements, technical guidelines, and performance and reporting guidelines. Similarly, in 
2016, Nigeria enacted a dedicated regulatory framework for mini-grids, with subsequent revisions to also 
cover emerging technologies such as interconnected mini-grids (IRENA, 2022f).
Tanzania and Uganda have similar RISE scores but attract less investment compared with Nigeria and Kenya. 
Although these two countries have higher RISE scores for grid electrification and utility creditworthiness and 
transparency than Nigeria and Kenya, such scores are not necessarily prerequisites for off-grid investments. In 
contrast, countries like Madagascar and Mozambique have relatively low RISE scores, but also low investments.
Box 3.2 Off-grid renewable energy investments and enabling policy frameworks

to household access, and the majority of the investments in Nigeria are for mini-grids for C&I purposes, the bubbles are 
relatively small.
Based on: Wood Mackenzie (2022a) and RISE (n.d.).
3.3.2 Investments by region of origin (based on the investor's primary location of operations)
As with overall renewable energy investment trends, the majority of the off-grid renewable 
investments in emerging and developing economies comprises of North-South flows, i.e. from 
developed countries to developing and emerging markets. At least 78% of the total commitments 
between 2010 and 2021 involved North–South flows (Figure 3.8). Of the total commitments, 
European investors committed USD 1.46 billion, or 47% of the total. An additional USD 812 million 
came from North America and Oceania (26% of the total), while Northeast Asian investors (mainly 
Japan) accounted for 2.6% of the total commitments (i.e. USD 78 million). 
South–South flows made up less than 20% of the overall financing between 2010 and 2021, 
although their contribution has been increasing gradually. About two-thirds of South–South flows 
have come from investors based in Sub-Saharan Africa – contributing USD 337 million, primarily 
through local institutional investors, and private equity firms and venture capitalists. Meanwhile, 
Southeast Asia–based investors contributed USD 92 million over the same period, equivalent to 
17% of South–South flows. The majority of South–South flows are invested domestically and/or 
inter-regionally, although since 2014, some inter-regional investments have arisen primarily from 
investors based in Sub-Saharan Africa.It should be noted that the analysis in this section is based on where an investor is domiciled. In 
other words, investors are given a “North” or “South” classification based on their operations’ 
location, as opposed to where funding first originated, since this is often more difficult to track, 
especially because funding may have originated from multiple sources. So, even in cases where 
an investor may be based in the Global South, part of the funding may have first originated from 
the Global North. Given this limitation, the actual share of South–South flows is probably smaller 
than indicated in this section. USD million (constant 2020)

3.4 Off-grid renewable energy investments by type of financing instrument
Between 2010 and 2021, debt and equity investments contributed about 47% and 48% of 
the overall financing, respectively, with an additional 5% contributed by grants. While equity 
investments were almost entirely utilised to finance company operations or expansion of 
activities, debt (primarily term loans and venture debt /convertible debt / bonds) is often directed 
at both companies and projects. By technology, debt financing constituted the majority of the 
investments in SHSs and solar lights over 2010-2021 (54% of the total, and rising over time) – a 
finding confirmed by ESMAP et al. (2022b). On the other hand, equity financing dominated the 
micro-/mini-grid space, constituting 74% of the overall financing over the same period. Overall, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, the majority of off-grid renewable energy 
financing came from equity investments owing to the domination by private equity, venture 
capital and infrastructure funds and the lack of access to debt for the sector. The share of equity 
has seen a relative decline in part due to the uncertainties posed by the pandemic, and the limited 
track record of exits and capital recycling in the sector, which may explain the limited number 
of new equity investors entering the sector in recent years (see Section 3.5 and Box 3.3). At the 
same time, the contribution of debt has increased sharply over the past two years, particularly 
as debt-preferring DFIs bolstered their support during the pandemic (Figure 3.9) and major 
off-grid companies were able to capitalise on their strong market position to secure large-size 
predominantly debt-based deals from both public and private investors (ESMAP et al. 2022b).
In addition, relatively established markets such as Kenya and Nigeria are seeing more local 
currency debt financing. During 2020-2021, about 28% of debt was denominated in local 
currencies (primarily the Kenyan shilling, followed by the Nigerian naira), compared with just 11% 
during the pre-pandemic years (Figure 3.9). This included a USD 75 million equivalent Sustainable 
Finance Facility for Greenlight Planet Kenya (now known as Sun King) and the USD 127 million 
equivalent financing vehicle called Brighter Life Kenya 1 Limited. Although the volumes of local 
currency financing were lower before 2020, a more diverse mix of countries was receiving this 
financing, including some relatively underdeveloped markets, such as Côte d’Ivoire, Mozambique, 
Rwanda and Uganda, among others. In 2018, for example, Zola Electric received an equivalent of 
USD 9 million to provide access through SHSs to approximately 100 000 rural households in Côte 
d’Ivoire.10
Going forward, low-cost local currency financing will be preferred for the next phase of the offgrid renewable energy sector’s development. Established companies are looking to finance the 
next phase of their development, while younger companies would benefit from the low cost of 
capital to build profitable businesses and attract equity investors. In the absence of low-cost 
financing, the burden may fall disproportionately on low-income households as companies seek 
to increase profitability, and maintain healthy cash flows, to service their debt obligations or 
satisfy the expectations of equity investors. To date, however, local currency financing available 
from local commercial banks is often more expensive than foreign-currency-denominated debt 
available from DFIs,11 since the former often see the sector as nascent and riskier, and have limited 
appetite for such investments given the availability of alternatives, e.g. government securities 
(AfDB, 2020). Opportunities for DFIs to partner with local financing institutions to deliver localcurrency debt are also emerging. Husk Power Systems, for instance, raised INR 310 million 
(USD 4.2 million) in debt to develop 140 mini-grids in India from the state-owned non-banking 
financing institution India Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) utilising a line of 
credit provided by KfW.
10 Notably, Ziz Energie was the only relatively underdeveloped off-grid market to receive a local currency loan of USD 6 million 
equivalent from the Development Bank of Central African States (BDEAC) to fund hybrid solar mini-grids.
11 Furthermore, AfDB (2020) reports that even with the provision of guarantees, there are limited to no benefits on borrowing costs, 
although this can reduce collateral requirementsThe 2020-2021 period was also marked with some sizeable deals under a blended financing 
mechanism. At least 26.5% of the USD 996 million committed during this period was mobilised 
through a blended financing approach comprising a mix of debt, equity and grants, as well as risk 
mitigation instruments. This included the USD 90 million raised by Zola Electric from more than 
eight investors, including SunFunder, Total Energies Ventures and FMO (a Dutch development 
bank), each bringing in unique attributes suited for various related risks and opportunities. In this 
way, blended finance combines the unique attributes of DFIs, private investors and governments 
to address different investment-related risks. These structures have great potential to attract 
private financiers to transactions that by themselves might have difficulty obtaining commercial 
financing (IRENA, 2022f). USD million (constant 2020)

3.5 Off-grid renewable energy investments by financing source and 
type of investor
Private investments grew by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33% during 2014-2019, 
but this growth was slightly reversed in 2020-2021 due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Private investors’ contribution fell from USD 361 million in 2019 to USD 277 million in 
2021. Despite their declining contributions over the past two years, private sources continue to 
provide substantial volumes of investments to the sector.Over time, the sector has drawn in substantial private financing from private equity and venture 
capitalists, as well as asset managers who are looking to diversify their portfolios (Falchetta 
et al. 2022; Wood Mackenzie, 2019). Private equity, venture capital and infrastructure funds12
provided 32% of off-grid renewable investments between 2010 and 2021, having committed 
USD 985 million. Their appetite for ventures with a limited track record but high-growth potential 
makes these types of investors (especially venture capitalists) a particularly suitable source of 
capital for the off-grid sector (Figure 3.10). In 2020-2021, their share of investments fell slightly, 
likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that most of them had initially invested through 
equity and had yet to realise sufficient capital gains through successful exits (Acumen, 2019)
(also see Box 3.3 on limited exits and capital recycling in the off-grid sector). A limited track record 
of successful exits and capital recycling may be deterring new equity investors from coming 
in, which may further explain the declining share of equity (as seen in Figure 3.9 on financing 
instruments).
Institutional investors provided 19% of the investments in the off-grid space – equivalent to 
USD 583 million – although this has primarily come from foundations,13 as opposed to the likes 
of pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and asset managers that have a strong preference for 
larger transaction sizes and well-proven technologies and business models. In 2020-2021, their 
contributions shrank slightly, both in terms of magnitude and share (Figure 3.10). Foundations are 
increasingly playing an active role in the sector bridging the funding gaps in the sector focusing on 
end-user and enterprise financing, as well as broader market development (e.g. capacity building, 
piloting nexus applications). Institutional investors can help bridge some of the funding gap in the 
sector, although this will require addressing barriers related to small ticket sizes, underdeveloped 
policy and regulatory environments, and market uncertainty, which give rise to a range of real 
and perceived risks. The strategic use of blended financing mechanisms will be key for addressing 
these challenges and tapping institutional investors’ balance sheets.
Corporations and business associations’ investments peaked in 2019 at USD  68  million, as 
shown in Figure 3.10, but they were less than half of this amount over the following two years 
combined. Similarly, investments from commercial finance institutions (e.g. banks) remained 
sporadic throughout this period, and tended to come from multi-national commercial banks that 
have sufficient access to foreign exchange (AfDB, 2020). For example, in 2021, the Standard Bank 
Group and Citi, two multi-national commercial banks, partnered together with the CDC Group and 
Norfund to provide a USD 75 million equivalent local-currency financing facility for Greenlight 
Planet Kenya, an off-grid solar home solutions company (British International Investment, 2021).

Profitable exits (e.g. an event in which an investor may sell a company to realise a financial gain) serve as 
proof points for later-stage commercial investors to gain confidence in the sector, while also allowing earlystage investors to recycle their capital into new, pioneering off-grid companies. This is a critical component 
of building the robust capital market needed to support continued innovation and scale in the off-grid energy 
sector. However, there have been few exits in off-grid energy to date. Some estimates show that between 2012 
and 2017, only USD 50 million of the USD 1.4 billion invested via equity was returned to investors, through 
12 exits. This is primarily due to issues related to:
Profitability. Many companies are not yet profitable to date, which has deterred later-stage investors from 
entering the market. Low profitability is primarily due to complex business models and higher-than-expected 
operating costs.
High valuations of off-grid companies due to over-reliance on equity in the early days of the sector. This 
has resulted in a mismatch between the valuations that early-stage investors need to generate a return and 
the valuation that potential investors are willing to accept, in turn limiting secondary capital from coming in.
As companies look to scale their operations, improving their unit economics will go a long way in facilitating 
exits and capital recycling in the sector. More recently, in 2022, Apis Partners was able to realise a full exit 
from its initial investment of USD 60 million (both debt and equity) in Sun-King (formerly known as Greenlight 
Planet) made five years prior (Africa Capital Digest, 2022). The company recently raised USD 260 million in 
Series D financing – the largest deal seen in the sector – which enabled the exit and serves as a model for 
other companies and investors.
Source: Acumen (2019).
Box 3.3 Limited exits and capital recycling in the off-grid sectorIndividuals (high-net-worth individuals, families or households) invested an average of 
USD 20 million per year during 2015-2021. This was primarily through dedicated crowdfunding 
platforms, where a number of companies launched fundraising campaigns especially in the past 
two years to refinance existing debt or continue operating, since many customers defaulted on 
payments or delayed them due to the economic pressures of the pandemic (IRENA, 2022f). 
Overall, off-grid renewable energy access has received a total of USD 117 million in investments 
via crowdfunding platforms such as TRINE, Energise Africa and Lendahand, more than 85% of 
which was debt. 
As private investment activity declined in 2020-2021, public financing (especially from DFIs) 
provided the sector with a much-needed boost. DFIs’ contribution increased by 67% from 
USD 93 million in 2019 to USD 260 million in 2021. Overall, the share of public financing increased 
from 30% during 2015-2019 to 44% during 2020-2021 (Figure 3.11), compensating for the
shortfall in private investment activity. 
Although about a fifth of the financing during 2010-2021 came from public sources of capital,14
their “true” contribution goes beyond the mere provision of capital for projects but also in creating 
an enabling policy and regulatory environment, building capacity, bridging affordability gaps and 
creating market awareness (see Box 3.4 on the public financing framework for energy access).
To date, public investment has been essential to kick-start new markets and advance early phases 
of development, for instance, by supporting pilot projects for emerging technologies and business 
models, or by mitigating early-stage project risks.

14 The remaining coming from “public-private” capital providersAn estimated USD 45 billion in annual funding is required to achieve universal energy access by 2030, and 
public finance is the key to closing this gap. Besides de-risking and catalysing private capital into projects 
and solutions, public finance has a key role to play in investments in public goods unaddressed by the market
(e.g. education and training, awareness raising, planning), and in ensuring access to underserved and 
marginalised communities and end users where/for whom affordability gaps are the most significant. 
Public financing commitments and appropriate instruments have to be scaled significantly to achieve the SDG 7 
goals. Public financing needs vary depending on the technology solution (stand-alone systems, mini-grids, 
clean cooking solutions) and the stakeholders in the ecosystem, including end users and enterprises. Ensuring 
access to tailored financing instruments will be key to building sustainable markets and creating local value.
Existing frameworks do not adequately track or analyse public financing for energy access to ascertain whether 
sufficient magnitude is being mobilised and deployed through the right instruments. An upcoming analysis by 
IRENA offers a tool (referred to as the framework) to guide policy makers and public financers to track and optimise 
public financing in advancing energy access (Figure 3.12). It seeks to 1) map the public financing needs across the 
energy access ecosystem; 2) identify challenges in scaling modern energy access that public finance must address; 
and 3) understand stakeholder preferences across public finance instruments, intermediaries and recipients.

Note: CBO = community-based organisation; DFI = development finance institution; LPG = liquefied petroleum gas;
MFI = microfinance institution; NGO = non-governmental organisation.DFIs were the largest public capital providers, having committed USD 818 million in 2010-2021, 
which represents 79% of the overall public investments for off-grid renewables (or 27% of 
the overall total investments). Notably, DFIs’ contributions in the last two years of 2020-2021 
constitute half of their overall contributions since 2010. During 2020-2021, these investments 
slightly exceeded those made by private equity, venture capitalists and infrastructure funds 
(Figure 3.10). Some recent investments include: 
• In October 2022, the US International Development Finance Corporation (USDFC) announced 
a USD 40 million investment in the Energy Entrepreneurs Growth Fund, a fund created by 
UK aid and FMO (the Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank) with an objective to expand 
(off-grid) energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since its creation in 2019, the fund has 
invested patient capital in off-grid energy companies with a focus on mezzanine instruments 
combined with technical assistance. By the end of 2022, the fund was expected to have 
committed USD 31.5 million across ten companies (USDFC, 2022). 
• In 2021, Zola Electric raised USD 90 million (split almost equally between debt and equity) 
through a blended financing mechanism and split between several private equity firms and 
venture capitalists as well as the likes of FMO and SunFunder (Energy Capital and Power, 2021). 
• In 2021, the Facility for Energy Inclusion (FEI) structured its inaugural transaction of a 
EUR 60 million multi-country facility for ActivCo SAS to construct renewable energy power 
plants for telecommunications providers, in turn replacing polluting diesel generators 
(FEI, 2021). The FEI is a specialised renewable energy debt fund headed by the African 
Development Bank, Norfund, KfW and others. The fund has an objective of enhancing energy 
access through small-scale independent power producers and mini-grid projects in Africa 
(GET.invest, n.d.).
In addition, many COVID-related relief funds were announced, including the Electricity Access 
Relief Fund managed by Social Investment Management and Advisors (SIMA). Among many 
of its recent initiatives, in 2020, the United States Agency for International Development 
(through its Power Africa programme) provided USD 2.6 million in grant money to power nearly 
300 health-care facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, despite the announcement of several 
COVID-related relief funds, only a small amount has actually been disbursed to date. This may 
be a result of drawn-out approval procedures, which can often take up to a year for most DFIs 
(Falchetta et al. 2022; Wood Mackenzie, 2019). 
Government agencies and intergovernmental institutions provided additional public funding, 
primarily in the form of grants. In 2021, an off-grid rural electrification project was launched 
in Cambodia with funding from the Government of Australia. The project would provide 
USD  1.54  million in grants under the broader Mekong-Australia Partnership (Niseiy, 2021). 
Provision of more grants will be essential in nascent markets with substantial access deficits and 
high (real or perceived) risks that may deter traditional equity and debt investors.Although off-grid renewable energy investments currently represent a small part of the overall 
energy access financing landscape, they are crucial to closing the world’s large energy access 
gap (of 733 million people) and engendering just and inclusive economic development. Current 
investment levels fall far short of the USD 2.3 billion needed annually in off-grid solar products 
alone (not including mini-grids) between 2021 and 2030 (ESMAP et al. 2022b), including on the 
consumer side to ensure affordability. Improving access to affordable finance, both upstream for 
project developers and downstream for energy users, will be critical to scaling up the penetration 
of off-grid renewable energy solutions. New financing approaches and instruments are required 
to this end, with public sector playing a far larger role (see Chapter 4).

WAY FORWARD 04
Global investments in the energy transition including renewable energy continued to increase 
in the past couple of years, despite macroeconomic, geopolitical and supply chain challenges. 
Yet, their scale and scope need to expand significantly to achieve climate and socio-economic 
development goals.
The current pace of investment is not sufficient to put the world on track towards meeting the 
climate objectives outlined in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. While global investment in renewable 
energy reached a record high in 2022 (at USD 0.5 trillion), it was less than one-third of the average 
investment needed each year between 2023 and 2030 (about USD 1.6 trillion in renewable power 
and the direct use of renewables – see Table 1.1) according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Investments 
are also not flowing at the pace or scale needed to achieve the improvements in livelihoods 
and welfare under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. For example, investments in
off-grid renewable energy solutions in 2021 (at USD 0.5 billion) fell far short of the USD 2.3 billion 
needed annually in off-grid solar products alone (not including mini-grids) between 2021 and 
2030 to accelerate progress towards universal energy access (ESMAP et al., 2022a).
Moreover, investments have become further concentrated in specific technologies and uses, and 
in a small number of countries/regions. In 2020, solar photovoltaic alone attracted 43% of total 
investment in renewables, followed by onshore and offshore wind (at 35% and 12% respectively). 
To best support the energy transition, more funds need to flow to less mature technologies and 
to sectors beyond power (e.g. heating and cooling, transport, energy efficiency and system 
integration). 
More importantly, more than 50% of the world’s population, mostly residing in developing and 
emerging countries, received only 15% of global investments in 2022. Sub-Saharan Africa, for 
example, received less than 1.5% of the amount invested globally between 2000 and 
2020. Investments in the region have been on a downward trend (from USD  5.3  billion 
in 2019 to less than USD  3.6  billion in 2022), even though the world emerged from the 
pandemic supposedly recognising the critical role energy plays in enabling health care, 
sanitation and resilient livelihoods. The disparity in renewable energy financing received by In 2015, the renewable energy investment per capita in Europe or North America (excluding 
Mexico) was almost 23 times higher than that in Sub-Saharan Africa, for example. In 2021, 
investment per capita in Europe was 41 times that in Sub-Saharan Africa, and in North America it 
was 57 times more (see Section 2.3).
For the energy transition to have a positive impact, governments and development partners need 
to play a more active role in ensuring a more equitable flow of finance recognising the different 
endowments and starting conditions of countries. More public funds need to flow to regions and 
countries that have a lot of untapped potential but find it difficult to attract investment. These 
funds need to go into supporting energy transition infrastructure development, enabling policy 
frameworks as well as address persistent socio-economic gaps.
This chapter begins with a discussion on the limitations of using public funds mainly for de-risking 
investments and highlights the need for a much stronger role for public financing. Recognising 
the limited public funds available in the developing world, the need for stronger international 
collaboration including a substantial increase in financial flows from the Global North to the Global 
South is discussed. The chapter then goes into the different sources, intermediaries and policy 
instruments that can channel public financing into the energy sector and the whole economy, to 
support a just and inclusive transition. The chapter discusses how lending to developing countries 
must be reformed and how the way public investment can be used to crowd in private investment 
needs to be more innovative.
1 Investments have been primarily led by the private sector while 
public policy and funds have focused on derisking investments. 
Although this approach has proven effective in many countries,
it has its limitations. 
Private investments made up almost 70% of the total investments in 2020 (USD 240 billion)1
and went mainly to relatively advanced economies. The disproportionate flow of investments 
towards mature technologies/applications and specific markets reflects a key characteristic of 
mainstream private capital: it favours lower-risk investments and prioritises financial returns over 
social, environmental, and climate-related gains. As such, private capital tends to go to countries 
with lower real or perceived risks, or into frontier markets only when effective risk mitigation 
facilities are provided, while a large portion of the world’s population remains underserved. 
When capital does flow to higher-risk environments, it generally does so at a much higher cost
(see Box 4.3). This means that the lowest income populations end up paying the most for (often 
basic) energy which is universally recognised as essential for alleviating poverty and promoting 
socio-economic advancement. This necessitates a much stronger role for public financing in these 
contexts and not fully relying on private capital which may keep widening the disparities.
1 Investment data by source of funding are available only up to 2020But public funds are limited, so governments have been focusing what is available on derisking 
projects and improving their risk-return profiles to attract private capital. Risk mitigation 
solutions have been used to lower the risks associated with renewable energy projects’ ability 
to repay obligations. Such risks stem from uncertainties regarding government actions (political, 
regulatory, policy), macroeconomic conditions (e.g. currency risks), off-taker creditworthiness, 
force majeure events, and others. Among risk mitigation instruments, sovereign guarantees have 
been preferred for lenders looking to obtain a “one-size-fits-all” solution for credit risks. But 
such guarantees are treated as contingent liabilities by regulators, credit-rating agencies and 
international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and may hamper a country’s 
ability to take on additional debt for critical infrastructure development and other investments 
(IRENA, 2020a). 
Moreover, sovereign debts are already stressed to their breaking point in many emerging 
economies grappling with high inflation and currency fluctuations or devaluations in the wake of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, sovereign debt defaults hit a record high, three times greater 
than in 2019. Among the defaulting countries were Argentina, Ecuador, Lebanon, Suriname and 
Zambia (Fitch Wire, 2021); many other countries are at high risk of sovereign default. In this 
macroeconomic environment, many countries cannot access affordable capital in international 
financial markets or provide sovereign guarantees as a risk mitigation instrument. Given 
the urgent need to step up the pace and geographic spread of the energy transition, and to 
capture its full potential in achieving socio-economic development goals, more innovative 
instruments are needed that help underinvested countries reap the long-term benefits of the 
energy transition without putting their fiscally constrained economies at a further disadvantage
(see Sections 4.5 and 4.6). 
Moreover, a more comprehensive way of defining risk (including risk sharing) is needed. The 
narrow focus on the risk of investment in energy assets not paying off - from the perspective 
of returns-to-investors only - needs to be broadened to include environmental, planetary, and 
social risks. These include the risk of leaving a large part of the population out of the energy 
transition and locked in underdevelopment, and the risk of Sustainable Development Goals 
remaining far from being met. This is how investment risks must be viewed from the perspective 
of governments and the international community. And with the very limited public funds available 
in the developing world, the international community must step up. 
2 The majority of public investments are made from national sources 
with relatively little international collaboration. The international 
flow of public money to renewable energy has been in decline 
since 2018. 
State-owned financial institutions (SOFIs), national development finance institutions (N-DFIs) and 
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were the main sources of public finance for renewables in 2020, 
providing more than 80% of public finance (which totalled USD 108 billion).Public finance flows to the Global South are essential to achieving the 1.5°C Scenario along with 
the socio-economic benefits that can be achieved (together with progressive fiscal measures 
and other government programmes such as distributional policy, as outlined in IRENA [2022a]). 
For instance, almost 80% of investments in off-grid renewables between 2010 and 2021 involved 
North–South flows (see Section 3.3.2). However, the international flow of public finance going 
to renewable energy has been in decline since 2018 (IEA, IRENA et al. 2022). Multilateral DFIs 
provided less than 2% of total renewable energy investments in 2020, while commitments 
from bilateral DFIs fell 70% from 2019 to USD 2.3 billion, or less than 0.5% of total investments. 
The minuscule shares of investment coming from multilateral and bilateral DFIs are cause for 
concern given the pressing need to increase investments to drive a just and equitable energy 
transition. Even debt financing at market rates (requiring repayment with interest rates charged 
at market value) is on a decline while grants and concessional loans amounted to just 1% of total 
renewable energy finance. The Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), launched at COP26 as 
an innovative model for providing funding baskets from donor countries – mainly G7 countries – 
to support developing countries in their energy transitions, but it mainly provides loans with very 
few grants (Box 4.1).
The Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) is an example of financing cooperation mechanism presented as 
a package to support developing countries in their energy transitions in a just way. It aims for early retirement 
of coal-fired power plants and mobilising private sector capital to decarbonise the economy while ensuring a 
just transition for citizens. 
The JETP provides funding baskets from donor countries and relies on self-defined pathways developed by 
beneficiary countries to address their energy transition needs. Its emphasis on justice includes a focus on skills 
training and job creation for those adversely affected by the energy transition. More than one year into the 
implementation of the JETP, the following points were noted: 
The majority of existing JETP financing packages consist of loans. Beneficiaries of the JETP must stand 
firm on the appropriate financing terms to avoid increased sovereign indebtedness. South Africa’s JETP 
financing package comprises 81% loans and only 4% grants, while the rest are guarantees. The indicative mix 
for Viet Nam’s JETP financing package is 1.3% grants, and the remainder loans (Chinh, 2022). Grants should 
play a bigger part of the financing packages in order to give beneficiary countries a socially just funding 
scheme. The skewed grant/loan mix can be addressed by providing funding from donor countries largely in 
the form of grants; opting for debt-for-climate swaps;a
 raising loans to private sector entities commercially 
instead of giving companies funding from the JETP scheme (Naudé, 2022).
Relying solely on the JETP’s financing support will not be enough to meet each beneficiary’s investment 
requirement for a just energy transition. This is evidenced in the case of South Africa’s Just Energy Transition 
Investment Plan (JET-IP), which laid out a USD 98 billion requirement for its energy transition. The JETP deal 
will make up less than 10% with 8.5 billion. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s USD 20 billion deal is only a small fraction 
of its indicative requirement of USD 3.5 trillion for a sustainable energy overhaul. The Indonesian government 
is pursuing multiple energy transition packages from different sources and donors simultaneously to attract 
funding (Gunfaus et al, 2022). 
The “just” elements are the hardest to establish and finance. This can be seen in South Africa’s JETIP, where economic diversification and innovation and skills development make up only 0.4% of the total 
amount planned. In addition, grants account for only 4% of the JETP funding package, making South Africa 
vulnerable to risks associated with privatisation which might also apply for other beneficiary countries.
Box 4.1 The Just Energy Transition PartnershipPublic funding for renewable energy finance (and climate finance more broadly) has faced 
several challenges in a deteriorating global economic context, especially in the past three years. 
The recent macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges have required both developed and 
developing countries to divert attention and funds towards adjustment policies to tackle inflation, 
disruptions of supply chains, food shortages and slow growth, creating a very challenging 
economic context where renewable energy investments are competing for increasingly scarce 
public resources. Renewable energy investments are therefore facing increasing constraints as 
governments consolidate and rebuild the fiscal space and tackle high public debt. This has led to 
additional challenges in mobilising public, concessional and blended financing, particularly in the
developing world. 
Yet, even in this context, as shown in IRENA’s report Post-COVID Recovery: An Agenda for 
Resilience, Development and Equality, energy transition investments can pave the way for 
equitable, inclusive and resilient economies (IRENA, 2020d). For that, international collaboration 
between the Global North and the Global South, and North-South flows of public financing will 
be key (see Section 4.4). Such financing can take the form of capital transfers through official 
development assistance (ODA) including donations and grants, concessional and market rate 
financing from DFIs and export credit agencies (ECAs); capitalisation of multilateral and UN-linked 
funds (such as the Green Climate Fund) or programmes from international organisations (such as 
IRENA’s Energy Transition Accelerator Financing – Box 4.2) to support renewable investments in 
less-developed countries, including guarantees; and issuance of commercial and debt obligations 
(government, N-DFIs and DFIs) such as power purchase agreements (PPAs). Carbon emission 
permits and off-setting markets play a secondary but relevant role in complementing financing. 
The JETP’s proposed reforms align with a power sector restructuring agenda promoted across the Global 
South since the 1990s, albeit with uneven success (Hadley, 2022; Sward, 2022; WWF, SACAN and IEJ, 2022). 
IRENA’s study RE-organising power systems for the transition shows the need for a different power system 
organisational structure that can support the energy transition and the power systems of the future while 
avoiding potential misalignments (IRENA, 2022f; 2022h). 
To live up to the expectations of an innovative funding mechanism, the JETP’s financing packages must 
strive to adopt a holistic approach and be country-owned. Historically, donors have chosen piecemeal 
projects that catered to their preferences, leading to fragmented development and investment plans across 
developing countries. The JETP is expected to be comprehensive, covering all sectors and all citizens. Thus, 
negotiations for JETP financing packages must not skew to donor preferences, and accompanying plans must 
be country led and country owned (Gunfaus et al. 2022).
a Debt-for-climate swaps involve a bilateral or multilateral donor, private investor, or non-governmental organisation, writing 
off or paying off a portion of a country’s foreign debt in exchange for the country financing climate change adaptation and 
mitigation projects using local funds. Between 1991 and 2003, debt-for-nature swaps generated almost USD 1.1 billion for 
conservation measures, in return for debt with face value volumes of almost USD 3.6 billion (Naudé, 2022).3 To achieve a just and inclusive energy transition, public financing - 
including through international collaboration - has a critical role to 
play across a broad spectrum of policies. 
Public funding must flow into the renewable energy sector (covering all segments of the value 
chain), the wider energy sector and the economy as a whole, for a just and equitable energy 
transition. Public funds can be mobilised and provided using a variety of instruments. Figure 4.1 
shows the types of instruments that can be used to channel public finance, the sources of public 
funds (either national government or international through collaboration), and the intermediaries 
that can help channel them (N- DFIs, local banks, multilateral and bilateral DFIs, ECAs, special 
purpose vehicles and funds including UN-linked funds such as the Green Climate Fund). 
These instruments can be existing or newly designed and may include (1) government spending 
such as grants, rebates and subsidies; (2) debt including existing and new issuances, credit 
instruments, concessional financing and guarantees; (3) equity and direct ownership of assets 
(such as transmission lines or land to build projects); and (4) fiscal policy and regulations 
including taxes and levies, exemptions, accelerated depreciation, deferrals, and regulations such 
as PPAs (especially when the tariffs paid to producers – in addition to the cost of running the 
system - are lower than what is collected by consumers and the difference is paid through a
government subsidy). However, such instruments should be used with caution as to not concentrate 
the benefits among a small number of players in the industry, and instruments should be designed 
in a way that distributes the benefits in an equitable and fair way.
The Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) platform is an inclusive, multi-stakeholder climate finance 
platform managed by IRENA that facilitates capital mobilisation to finance feasible renewable energy projects 
in developing countries. As of February 2023, the platform had received pledges from four institutions, 
amounting to USD  900  million to deploy approximately 1.5  GW of renewable energy projects by 2030.
The ETAF aims to: 
• Facilitate and build a geographic and technologically diversified pipeline of bankable renewable energy 
projects in developing countries;
• Provide technical assistance to eligible projects to ensure bankability regarding economic, environmental,

Box 4.2 Energy Transition Accelerator Financing As show in in Figure 4.1, public finance flows via instruments in various policy categories of 
IRENA’s broad policy framework. Examples include the following: 
a. Under deployment policies, public funds can flow as direct investments in governmentowned energy transition-related assets, public-private partnerships, or in designing and 
funding policies that can attract or support private investment (e.g. capital subsidies, grants 
and tariff-based mechanisms such as auctions, FiTs and FiPs). 
b. Under integrating policies, public investments can go into infrastructure and assets that 
support the integration of renewables into the energy system (e.g. regional and national 
transmission lines, pumped hydroelectric energy storage facilities). 
c. Under enabling policies, public money can support long term energy planning, capacity 
building and training, research and development, as well as technical assistance offered 
via multilateral development banks (MDBs) and inter-governmental organisations such as 
IRENA. 
d. Under structural change and just transition policies, public funds can go into the redesign of 
power markets to make them more conducive for large shares of variable renewable energy, 
towards the development of local industry and value chains, or towards compensation 
for the phasing-out of fossil fuels, as well as policies to ensure that the energy transition 
promotes gender equality and social inclusion, among many other priorities.

Figure 4.1 The flow of public finance for a just and inclusive energy transitione. The global policy framework defines international and South-South collaboration which is 
key to structuring and ensuring the international flows from the Global North to the Global 
South.
f. In addition, although not directly related to any specific sector, there are macroeconomic 
policies (fiscal, monetary and currency exchange policies) that affect the delivery of public 
funds towards the energy transition (Table 4.1) 
Some elements presented in the framework (Figure 4.1) might overlap. For example, tax 
incentives are at the same time fiscal policies while acting as deployment policies, and funding 
grid infrastructure can be viewed as an enabling or an integrating policy. While funding capacity 
building is part of an enabling policy, these funds also facilitate structural change, being part of 
social development programmes, and education, social protection and compensation policies, 
etc. Thus, there are complex inter-linkages and feedback loops between the different policies and 
instruments. By understanding the broad structural workings underlying the renewable energy 
“economy”, public policy and financing can be strategically used to advance the energy transition. 
4 The availability of capital for public investments in renewable 
energy will need to be increased, and lending to developing 
nations transformed. 
Today’s environment calls for a fundamental shift in how lending is made to developing nations, 
especially those affected by economic and climate crises, and how countries in the Global North 
support countries in the Global South to cope with and adapt to crises related to climate change, 
the cost of living and debt (which has been compounded following the COVID-19 pandemic and 
climate-related disasters). The situation in developing countries is being made more difficult amid 
tightening monetary policies and a strengthening US dollar. One in five countries is experiencing 
fiscal and financial stress, which if left unaddressed would deepen hardship, increase debt 
defaults, widen inequality and delay the energy transition. The Bridgetown Initiative, proposed at 
Macroeconomic policies that impact the flow of public finance
Fiscal policies
Set out the size and scope of a country’s “credit line” (government funds) through spending 
and taxes to finance, incentivise and guarantee economic activities including Official 
Development Assistance programmes. 
Monetary policies
Establish the pace of economic activities by controlling money supply to the economy to 
influence interest rates. They influence the cost of a country’s “credit line”, its stability and 
credit rating.
Foreign exchange 
policy
Connects the country’s economic activities with the rest of the world through the exchange 
rate, indicating the relative comparative advantage of a country vis-à-vis its partners and 
competitors. It also affects international trade and current accounts where investments are 
repaid (loans, hard currency denominated power purchase agreements, etc).
Table 4.1 Macroeconomic policies that affect the delivery of public funds Meanwhile, a decision was reached at COP27 to establish a loss and damage fund, particularly 
for those nations most vulnerable to climate events. Details regarding the amounts involved, and 
how the facility will be set up and operationalised are yet to be negotiated. The fund is expected 
to address adverse effects of climate impacts such as droughts, floods, rising seas and other 
disasters, which also impair the deployment of renewable energy.
Barbados is one of the most vulnerable nations to climate change. To address these vulnerabilities, the 
island’s first woman prime minister Mia Mottley is championing the Bridgetown Initiative, a proposal to reform 
development finance including from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which were set up 
in 1944 to repair economies and promote co-operation after World War II and the Great Depression of the 
1930s. This comes at a time when rich countries are able to borrow capital with interest rates of between 1% to 
4% while poorer countries – which are seen as riskier investments – pay interest rates of around 14%. Without 
access to concessional funding there is no way developing countries can fight climate change. 
The initiative calls upon global leaders to act now to save countries: 
1. Providing emergency liquidity and changing some of the terms around how funding to developing 
countries is loaned and repaid. The initiative calls upon the Board of the International Monetary Fund to: (i) 
return access to its unconditional rapid credit and financing facilities to previous crisis levels; (ii) temporarily 
suspend its interest surcharges; (iii) re-channel at least USD 100 billion of unused Special Drawing Rights 
to those that need it and (iv) operationalise the Resilience and Sustainability Trust. At the same time the 
initiative urges G20 members to approve an ambitious Debt Service Suspension Initiative encompassing 
multilateral development bank loans to the poorest countries, and COVID-related loans to middle-income 
countries. The aim is to stop developing nations from spiralling into a debt crisis, especially when their 
borrowing is forced by disasters like floods, droughts and storms. 
2. Expanding multilateral lending to governments by USD 1 trillion to address systemic challenges that are 
the heart of the current crises. Multilateral development bank shareholders are asked to increase their risk 
appetite and provide new guarantees to expand lending to governments by USD 1 trillion. New concessional 
loans should prioritise achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and building climate resilience in 
vulnerable countries.
3. Activating private sector savings for climate mitigation and fund reconstruction after a climate disaster 
through new multilateral mechanisms. Most climate-vulnerable countries do not have the fiscal space to 
adopt new debt. There is a need for a global mechanism for raising reconstruction grants for any country 
hit by a climate disaster.

Box 4.3 The Bridgetown Initiative 
Dave Primov © Shutterstock.comTapping pools of public funds for both developed and developing countries without burdening 
the fiscal space remains a key priority. Governments should adopt a “doing more with what is 
available” approach through enhanced collaboration among DFIs and MDBs, and by exploring 
the following mechanisms: 
Capital release from balance sheets of DFIs. Balance sheets of investors and financial institutions 
in general disclose rights and obligations connected to the owning and lending of assets. It 
is possible for DFIs to use those elements to raise additional funds through two mechanisms:
(1) posting existing assets as collateral (provided their value is free-and-clear of any encumbrances 
i.e. when assets such as shares are not pledged to any other lender as financial collateral); and 
(2) partially repackaging receivables from guaranteed loan repayments (e.g. loans that are 
guaranteed by insurers) into new financial structured products in the market. In practice, the DFIs 
could offer a (high rated) new debt product (e.g. a collateralised debt obligation)2
 guaranteed 
and managed by a bank such as an MDB to qualified investors (e.g. pension funds, insurers, 
institutional investors, etc.) and traded on international exchanges. The new debt obligation 
product’s proceeds would be used in new investments. 
The process is not new to lending institutions, but still practiced below prudent levels by public 
financial institutions, leaving unused sources of public funds that could become available to 
governments. Developed countries investing in renewable energy could further monetise current 
loan receivables which in turn can be accounted as de facto additional donors’ contributions to 
ODA/DFI/ECA programmes. However, the use of such products should be done with rigorous 
due diligence. 
Product innovation among MDBs. Multilaterals benefit from the convening power granted by 
shareholders in both developed and developing countries, to craft, implement and operate 
innovative frameworks to mobilise capital and mitigate risks. In particular, liquidity facilities can 
be scaled up to assist renewable energy investors fulfilling their business obligations by ensuring 
an uninterrupted flow of payments from off-takers without posing a burden on the fiscal space 
of developing countries (local- currency-denominated PPAs can also benefit from this facility). 
These liquidity facilities can evolve to incorporate the role of guarantor supported by MDBs and 
DFIs in compliance with guidelines issued by multilaterals and agreed by shareholders. The highly 
capitalised guarantor becomes a supranational facility to mitigate credit and foreign exchange 
risks for renewable energy investors and lenders. MDBs, under the approval of host governments, 
can allocate funds and credit lines to the facility up to prudent limits determined by Ministries of 
Finance and Central Banks. Box 4.4 showcases liquidity facilities supported by the World Bank, 
the German development bank KfW and the Nairobi-based African Trade Insurance. 
2 Collateralised debt obligations are asset-backed securities that bundle together a diversified portfolio of instruments (e.g. loans, 
bonds)Cash flows from underlying assets are used to repay investorsThe West African Power Pool (WAPP) was launched in 1999, inspired by the Energy Chart and responding to 
accelerating electricity access in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The Member 
States adopted the Energy Protocol in 2003, followed by two critical energy programmes to address 
energy shortage, and fast-track the energy security and economic integration of the sub-region. The WAPP 
programme set out to promote and develop power generation and transmission facilities, a regional electricity 
market and the co-ordination of power trade between the Member States. The integration benefits bring 
together resources in the east and hydropower in the west, and more recently renewable energy from the 
northeast (sun corridor). Resource development was carried out by the private sector and national utilities, 
interconnected by projects financed by the World Bank and African Development Bank over 20 years of an 
investment programme. 
The WAPP has faced significant payment arrears and led ECOWAS to approve a Directive on Securitization 
of Cross-Border Power Trade in 2018. Payment arrears triggered the intervention of Member States several 
times, jeopardising the intrinsic nature of the regional integration market. The directive established the 
security of cross-border power trade through secured supplies and payments and entered into force in 
January 2020. It steered finance and economic ministries to pursue the power sector’s financial sustainability 
and creditworthiness of counterparties. The decision also invited multilaterals to support implementation of 
the directive, freeing up budgetary funds for other productive purposes.
The World Bank approved a Development Policy Financing (DPF) in June 2020 to support ECOWAS’s directive 
on the securitisation of contracts. The USD  300  million facility was established in consultation with the 
affected Member States and included grants and loans. The DPF provides access to currency and payments, 
cushioning ministries of finance to back utilities and fulfil payment obligations. Burkina Faso, Guinea, Ivory 
Coast, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone are the participating concessional borrowers.
The DPF is based on prior actions (enabling policies) connected to clear objectives and measurable indicators. 
Its objective is to “increase energy security, reduce vulnerability to international oil price fluctuations and 
reduce the fiscal burden of the electricity sector through increased energy trade” in the six participating 
countries (World Bank, 2020). The DPF created a de facto liquidity facility for participant sovereigns to 
improve electricity exchange with indicators reflecting governments’ enabling policies.
A Regional Liquidity Support Facility (RLSF) has also been spearheaded by the German development bank 
KfW and African Trade Insurance (ATI). This is another example of a facility that provides short-term liquidity 
support for power producers in Africa via letters of credit issued by local banks who are in turn backed by 
the RLSF. It covers short-term liquidity risk in case of an off-taker’s non-payment of electricity to the power 
producer, improving the overall project’s creditworthiness.
The RLSF has two components – a cash collateral and an on-demand guarantee. The cash collateral is used 
by qualified banks to immediately pay the independent power producer if the letter of credit supporting 
electricity payments is called. The German government, through KfW, made EUR 31 million available to ATI 
for this purpose. The on-demand guarantee has the same amount as the cash collateral component and is 
provided by ATI. The guarantee is used in the event the cash collateral is exhausted.

Box 4.4 Liquidity facilities supported by the World Bank and KfW-ATI
Broadening capitalisation routes for MDBs. Capital calling from shareholders has been 
the common approach adopted by multilaterals to expand technical assistance and lending 
programmes - e.g. triennial capital replenishment by donors to fund the International 
Development Association investment programme managed by the World Bank. The new capital 
increases MDBs’ fund availability and enables them to place bonds in the global capital market,thereby raising additional capital. Bonds are placed as AAA-rated obligations guaranteed by 
MDBs – de facto, such institutions have an enviable track record recognised by countries and 
market participants in managing risks - that can be placed in the market, if appropriate financing 
vehicles are used and target markets are identified.
MDBs should now consider risk-tiered debt obligation placements with a different investment 
grade (BBB+ and above, e.g. multi-rated green bonds), implying different level of returns to 
bondholders. The initiative broadens access to the investor base – from institutional investors 
and sovereign wealth funds to corporate/qualified investors – increasing the amount of capital 
that could become available and deployed in renewable energy investments.
5 Meanwhile, public finance and policy should continue to be used 
to crowd in private capital. Policies and instruments beyond those 
used to mitigate risks are needed. 
Public finance should continue to be used strategically to crowd in additional private capital. 
Risk mitigation instruments (e.g. guarantees, currency hedging instruments and liquidity reserve 
facilities) will still play a major role, but public finance and policy must go beyond risk mitigation. 
Examples include funding capacity building, support for pilot projects and innovative financing 
instruments such as blended finance initiatives, etc. In addition, policy makers may consider the 
following: 
Incentivise an investment swap from fossil fuels to renewable energy by banks and national oil 
companies. Swapping significant investment from fossil fuels to renewable energy is necessary 
for achieving IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. 
Since the Paris Climate Agreement, large multi-national banks maintained (and even increased) 
their investments in fossil fuels, spending an average of USD 750 billion dollars a year. On a 
cumulative basis, the world’s 60 largest commercial banks invested around USD 4.6 trillion in 
fossil fuels between 2015 and 2021. Incentivising investors to divert funds towards the energy 
transition can be done through measures such as phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies and adapting 
fiscal systems to account for the environmental, social, and health impacts of a fossil fuel-based 
energy system (IRENA, 2022a). This will help level the playing field between fossil fuels and 
energy transition technologies, and factor into investment decision-making. A supplemental way 
of incentivising this shift is through highlighting and recognising the leadership role of those 
institutions that are paving the road through investments in the energy transition. More than 30 
significant financial institutions including banks, insurers, asset owners, and asset managers have 
committed to stop financing fossil fuels. Governments and civil societies can take steps to reward 
their leadership and encourage other institutions to take similar steps. After that, public pressure, 
along with policy and regulation, can further influence financial decision-making in favour of 
renewable energy and other energy transition technologies. (Environmental Finance, 2022).As for national oil companies, on the long run, the transition could be facilitated if royalties/
government-take associated with hydrocarbon production, for example, could be partially offset 
by royalties/levies from the use of land and ocean areas for renewable energy projects, once the 
sector matures and no longer requires support. As an example, the expected growth of offshore 
wind assets could potentially contribute to generating royalties to replace those from fossil fuels 
and support the reallocation of public funds towards the energy transition. As renewable energy 
is at early stages of becoming the “new normal” for energy companies, governments and project 
investors would be able to fully transition to a low-carbon environment while sustaining returns. 
Mobilise institutional investment and promote greater use of green bonds for renewables. 
With about USD 87 trillion of assets under management, institutional investors have a key role to 
play in reaching the investment levels required for the ongoing global energy transition. Greater 
participation of institutional capital will require a combination of effective policies and regulations, 
capital market solutions that address the needs of this investor class (e.g. green bonds), as 
well as a variety of internal changes and capacity building on the part of institutional investors
(IRENA, 2020d). 
Green bonds can help attract institutional investors and channel considerable additional private 
capital in the renewable energy sector, helping to fill the significant outstanding investment gap. 
Some recommended actions for policy makers and public finance providers to further increase 
green bond issuances include the adoption of green bonds standards in line with international 
climate objectives, the provision of technical assistance and economic incentives for green bond 
market development, and the creation of bankable project pipelines (IRENA, 2020e). 
Implement regulatory sandboxes for broadening access to capital and credit instruments. 
Regulatory sandboxes designed to serve broader social and environmental goals can help unlock 
more investments. In recent years for example, retail investors (e.g. Charles Schwab International) 
have used digital technology to connect investment opportunities to broader pools of capital, 
whereas previously these were only available to financial institutions and qualified investors. 
Many of these innovations were initiated through a regulatory sandbox which creates a space 
for entrepreneurs and companies to test innovative solutions, as they are granted (temporary) 
regulatory waivers and exemptions (EMA, n.d.). Such an approach can be used to further 
experiment and pilot new approaches towards financing renewable energy. 
By enacting regulatory sandboxes for start-ups and investors for both grid and off-grid initiatives, 
new solutions may emerge towards enabling access to pools of capital/credit instruments. Such 
initiatives can benefit from MDBs support (Barbalho et al. 2022) in connection with other available 
funding agencies at local, regional and global levels. Furthermore, companies can be invited to 
participate in the sandbox with a view to pilot innovative concepts that facilitate risk mitigation, 
including foreign exchange risks in electricity exchanges. For example, in the off-grid renewable 
energy sector, the advent of innovative technologies (blockchain, Internet of Things), business 
models (e.g. PAYG) and financing platforms (e.g. crowdfunding) (see Chapter 3) helped connect 
a larger pool of customers, investors and solution providers.Facilitate local currency lending and denominate PPAs (at least partially) in local currencies. 
Local currency PPAs are helpful to address the risks of currency devaluations which may 
otherwise cripple power off-takers’ ability to make payments to power producers in hard 
currency (such as the USD) at times when the domestic currency plummets. The approach has 
two significant advantages: mitigate impacts of foreign currency fluctuations on PPA payments 
and stimulate local financial markets and investors to engage in renewable energy investments. 
Such an arrangement is more readily acceptable if project financiers are also domestic, such as 
the national development bank, local lenders and institutional investors – for example, pension 
funds and insurance companies (IRENA, 2020a). MDBs have participated in such endeavours with 
considerable experience in assisting borrowers and lenders to address foreign currency fluctuation 
through liquidity and risk mitigation facilities (Box 4.5). A complementary mechanism to address 
foreign currency risks is to facilitate local currency lending for projects with development capital 
channelled through intermediaries including national banks or non-banking financial institutions. 
Several countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil and Jordan, have piloted such approaches to 
catalyse investment into the renewable energy sector. 
Enhance the participation of corporate actors. Although companies that produce renewable 
energy are already providing substantial investment in the sector, non-energy-producing 
corporations have a preeminent role to play in the energy transition by driving demand for 
renewable energy. By setting up the right enabling framework, policy makers can encourage
active corporate sourcing and unlock additional capital in the sector. Recommended actions 
include, for example, establishing a transparent system for the certification and tracking of 
renewable energy attribute certificates, enabling third-party sales between companies and 
independent power producers, and creating incentives for utilities to provide green procurement 
options for companies (IRENA, 2018b). 
The Nan Theun 2 (NT2) hydropower project in Lao PDR utilised one of the most advanced credit enhancement 
and foreign exchange risk mitigation structures designed by multilateral development banks in 2005. The 
hydropower dam developed on the Nam Theun River has an installed capacity of 1,070 megawatts (MW) 
of which 995  MW are destined for export to Thailand through a power purchase agreement with the 
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). The cost of the project amounted to USD 1.45 billion, with 
USD 1 billion of debt and USD 450 million of equity. The debt structure had two tranches: (1) USD 500 million 
obtained through various loans with multilateral/bilateral agencies and commercial financial institutions; and 
(2) USD 500 million denominated in Thai bhat (THB) provided by Thai banks. 
The Nan Theun 2 (NT2) hydropower project in Lao PDR mitigated foreign exchange risks through market-based 
instruments and liquidity facilities. EGAT’s PPA payment for electricity imports has two components: the THBdenominated tranche is paid directly to Thai banks, and the USD-denominated portion is paid in accordance 
with the rules of the Central Bank of Thailand. In addition, NT2 has a facility to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
through guarantees of USD 295 million from export credit agencies and multilateral development banks, of 
which USD 90 million is for a short-term revolving liquidity facility provided by the Asian Development Bank 
and the International Development Association. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency also provided 
USD 45 million of guarantees as convertibility and currency transferability insurance.

Box 4.5 Risk mitigation in partially denominated PPAs in local currencyIncentivise the participation of philanthropies. According to Oxfams report titled Survival of 
the Richest: How we must tax the super-rich now to fight inequality, the richest 1% own almost 
half of the world’s wealth while the poorest half of the world own just 0.75% (Oxfam, 2023). To 
tap into the existing wealth, governments should look at incentivising philanthropies to mobilise 
additional funds into support for renewable energy that can help fight poverty, inequality, 
climate change, and humanitarian crises. Philanthropies are playing an increasingly important 
role in bridging funding gaps, especially in the energy access context, where funds have gone 
into market development (e.g. technology innovation funds) and delivering financing for end 
users and enterprises through various instruments, such as results-based grants and equity. In 
2021, individuals, bequests, foundations and corporations gave an estimated USD 485 billion to 
charities in the United States alone. These were distributed towards education, human services, 
foundations, public-society benefit organisations, health, international affairs, environmental 
and other social services (Giving USA 2022, 2022). The energy transition being tied to all these 
objectives, tapping into these funds can help fill gaps left by governments to help poorer 
populations grow without relying on fossil fuels (Dennis, 2022).
