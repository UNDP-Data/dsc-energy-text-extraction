ENERGY TRANSITION 
OUTLOOKFOREWORD
Malaysia is among the most highly developed states of the Southeast Asia region and a founding member of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Over the next three decades, the Malaysian economy 
is expected to triple in size, while its population is projected to rise to over 40 million people; consequently, 
primary energy supply in Malaysia is set to increase by 60% over the same period.
Today, Malaysia stands at a crossroads. To meet this rising energy demand, the country could utilise its 
diminishing oil and gas resources and ultimately become reliant on international imports. On the other hand, 
it can choose to tap its considerable renewable energy resource potential to provide affordable, domestic 
alternatives to fossil fuels. 
Malaysia has wisely begun to focus on the latter, setting near-term targets to increase renewable energy to 
help meet rising demand. The country has also announced its aim to reach net-zero emissions by as early 
as 2050 – reflected in its latest National Energy Policy – and continues to refine a long-term low-emission 
development strategy. 
Malaysia is well positioned to develop a sustainable energy system based on higher shares of renewable 
energy that can support socio-economic development, address climate change and achieve greater energy 
security. 
To support this transition, this report provides a long-term energy pathway to a cleaner and more sustainable 
energy system in Malaysia. It explores end-use sector electrification, the rapid expansion of renewable 
generation, energy efficiency solutions, the role of emerging technologies such as clean hydrogen and 
batteries, as well as the importance of further power sector integration, both within the country and with 
neighbouring countries. 
The engagement of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change, Tenaga Nasional 
Berhad (TNB), Sabah Energy Berhad, Sarawak Energy Berhad and the Sustainable Energy Development 
Agency (SEDA) were central to the development of this report. We are also grateful to the Government of 
Denmark for its support for IRENA’s work in the ASEAN region. 
Malaysia can pursue a path to sustainability, prosperity, energy leadership and connectivity in ASEAN. This 
report, and the process undertaken to create it, represent an important phase in this journey. We stand 
ready to help Malaysia pursue an energy system based on the ample renewable energy resources available 
across the country and beyond, which can serve to lower energy costs, reduce emissions, drive economic 
development, and meet the country’s long-term energy and climate goals. 
Francesco La Camera
Director-General, IRENAFOREWORD
Malaysia recognises the importance of a future-proof energy system that is modern, reliable and affordable. 
We also believe that a sustainable and low carbon energy sector is vital contain the impacts of climate change. 
Malaysia’s relative share of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions is nominal – at 0.37% of global emissions – 
and compared with its peers in emission terms, the country is emissions efficient, with a GNI per capita of 
USD 10 930 in 2021. Admittedly, however, it is still necessary for us to play our part in ensuring that our 
cumulative emissions remain low. 
Therefore, as a responsible global citizen, Malaysia has pledged, in tandem with the international community, 
to ramp up our mitigation measures and gradually decarbonise our energy sector. We aspire to be carbon 
neutral by 2050 and we take this goal seriously. Based on our existing plans and projections, the power sector 
is expected to increase its renewable energy capacity to 31% by 2025 and 40% in 2035, reducing the carbon 
intensity to GDP of the sector by 60% by as early as 2030, compared to the year 2000 baseline. 
At the same time, Malaysia aspires to remain a dynamic and pre-eminent trading nation. Therefore, in response 
to heightened global calls for urgent climate action and a systemic shift to more sustainable economic models, 
our country needs to explore and unleash sustainability-driven economic areas, opportunities and potential 
to support our future growth, while decarbonising its various economic sectors. Indeed, a just and successful 
energy transition can emerge as a future source of jobs and business opportunities for our people. 
Hence, this Malaysia energy transition outlook – which embodies the cumulative efforts of IRENA and the 
Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change – is a timely document that presents options 
for the nation to accelerate its energy transition and achieve our carbon-neutral goals. I am confident that it 
represents a positive contribution to long-term policy planning for the energy sector in Malaysia.
I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the valuable support, inputs and insights provided 
by all stakeholders during its preparation, which have provided depth and nuance to the energy transition 
pathway we are exploring. Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to IRENA for its collaboration 
on this project, in addition to the Agency’s continued, vital efforts in advancing renewable energy solutions 
globally. It is my earnest hope that this report will mark the beginning of a significant partnership, as well as 
further beneficial co-operation, between IRENA and the Ministry in furthering the global energy transition 
agenda.

KEY MESSAGES
Malaysia is an emerging economy located in Southeast Asia and a member state 
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). By 2050, Malaysia’s 
population is expected to rise to 40.7 million people and the economy will 
nearly triple in size. The country’s primary energy supply will increase by 60% to 
6.7 exajoules (EJ) from 4.1 EJ in 2018.
To meet rising energy demand while ensuring energy security and affordability 
in the future, Malaysia stands at a crossroads: either continue using its diminishing 
oil and gas resources while also turning to volatile international oil and gas markets 
to import energy, or tap the significant potential of renewable energy sources that 
can provide local and affordable alternatives to fossil fuels. The report shows that 
it is cheaper to do the latter, with the share of renewable energy reaching over half 
the country’s final energy mix by 2050, up from just 5% today. 
Overall, the total cumulative energy system cost in the report’s 1.5°C Scenario 
(1.5-S) is USD 9 billion lower annually than in the main reference scenario, the 
Planned Energy Scenario (PES) in 2050. The avoided externalities due to health 
and climate change are between USD 2 billion and USD 4 billion annually in the 
1.5-S compared to the PES. Thus, transitioning towards renewable energy in 
the 1.5-S will save Malaysia between USD 9 billion and USD 13 billion annually in 
avoided energy, climate and health costs. 
In this lower-cost and lower-carbon future, the energy landscape in the 
country would change from one dominated by fossil fuels, which currently 
comprise around three-quarters of primary energy demand, to one that sees 
deep electrification across all end-use sectors, with electricity making up 40% of 
final energy. This entails scaling up annual electricity consumption from around 
150 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2018 to over 348 TWh by 2050, while also scaling up 
key renewable resources such as bioenergy, geothermal and hydrogen. Renewable direct-use is also important, with 20% of final energy coming from 
these sources by 2050. The production of clean hydrogen and its derivative fuels 
must ramp up from negligible levels in 2020 to at least 1.5 million tonnes by 2050.
The power sector would be greatly transformed, with two possible highly 
decarbonised routes explored in this report: a 100% renewable energy 
case (1.5-S RE100), and one with around 90% renewables combined with carbon 
capture and storage (CCS) (1.5-S RE90). These cases show how the availability of 
key technologies can influence the decarbonisation pathway to allow for a balanced 
perspective of the impacts of relying on different technologies. The two cases 
entail between 103 gigawatts (GW) and 153 GW of installed solar photovoltaics 
(PV), with 36 GW of other renewables, supported by 20 GW of battery storage. 
Regardless of the case, renewables would become the backbone of the power 
system; this also largely applies to lower-ambition scenarios.
To capitalise on the transition, Malaysia has an opportunity to capture large 
parts of the transition value chain, which will require the country to install up 
to 153 GW of solar PV, a total of 782 gigawatt-hours of storage and 109 million 
electric cars by 2050.
The report concludes with a chapter covering key recommendations on how 
to accelerate the energy transition in Malaysia. The broad categories include 
energy system and policy planning, regulatory and legal frameworks, technology 
and innovation, and financing. INTRODUCTION
Between 2010 and 2019, Malaysia’s total primary energy supply increased 3% annually on average, driven 
by strong economic and industrial growth as well as rapid urbanisation. By 2050, primary energy supply is 
expected to increase 1.5% annually on average, to 6.7 EJ. 
Malaysia has traditionally been a producer of oil and natural gas, with large reserves spread across the offshore 
waters of Peninsular Malaysia and the two states of Sabah and Sarawak on the island of Borneo. However, with 
limited reserves, the country could soon become a net importer of oil and gas. Malaysia’s primary energy mix 
is dominated by fossil fuels, which have accounted for more than 95% of the total for the past decade. This 
includes large amounts of imported coal to fuel the country’s power plants. Additionally, decades of direct 
and indirect fuel subsidisation policies in the country have kept energy prices low to spur economic growth, 
although several reforms made in the last decade have improved the government’s fiscal balance. 
By the end of 2021, Malaysia had a total installed electricity generation capacity of 33 GW connected to 
the grid. Power plants fired by coal and natural gas each accounted for around a third of the total installed 
capacity, with the rest consisting of a mix of large and small hydropower, biomass and solar PV. Based on the 
current plans for power generation, additional gas-fired plants are slated to be built in the coming decade, 
replacing old coal and gas units, while the country also seeks to increase solar PV capacity through various 
programmes. However, with the volatility in coal and gas prices in 2021 and 2022, Malaysia has now reached 
a crossroads, at which it may choose to either continue its current trajectory or further accelerate its energy 
transition beyond its renewable energy targets, while also keeping energy affordable. 
Malaysia has huge untapped potential renewable energy sources that can provide local and affordable 
alternatives to fossil fuels. The country’s installed capacities of solar PV and other renewables have been 
growing thanks to the establishment of concrete renewable energy policies and schemes, and a dedicated 
agency since the 2010s. However, more can be done to further accelerate the uptake of solar PV in order to 
exceed the target for renewable energy installed capacity of 40% by 2035. Furthermore, renewable energy 
targets should also be translated across other end-use consumption such as in the transport and industry 
sectors, which still rely heavily on fossil fuels. 
Malaysia’s latest Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) submission towards reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions under the Paris Agreement aims for an unconditional reduction in emission intensity (tonnes of CO2
emissions per unit of gross domestic product) of 45% by 2030 relative to the 2005 level. The country has also 
announced a target for net zero emissions by as early as 2050, as echoed in its latest National Energy Policy, 
and is preparing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS). This report is intended to shed 
light on possible energy pathways for how these targets can be met. This report focuses only on energyrelated CO2 emissions and does not account for offsets from carbon sinks, however it is important to note that 
efforts are needed across all greenhouse gases emitting sources. 
A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has prepared Energy Transition Outlooks to detail 
long-term perspectives for the world (World Energy Transitions Outlook, WETO), for regions (such as ASEAN) 
and for countries (this study). The present outlook combines IRENA’s Renewables Readiness Assessment 
with the Renewable Energy Roadmap (REmap) and Power System Flexibility Assessment to chart possible 
energy pathways to 2050 for Malaysia. The accelerated energy transition scenarios presented include the 
Transforming Energy Scenario (TES) and the 1.5°C Scenario (1.5-S), which is aligned with the 1.5-S in IRENA’s 
WETO, targeting net zero emissions globally by 2050.Table 1. They include efforts focused on scaling clean electricity to between 90-100% of generation as well 
as increasing renewable solutions in end-uses. Electrification will play an important role in important sectors 
such as transport and certain industry sub-sectors. Energy efficiency is also vital and improvements in energy 
intensity need to accelerate. Overall investment in energy transition investment needs to scale considerably, 
with as much as USD 415 billion needed in the 1.5-S. Finally carbon management solutions are also required to 
go the final mile in certain challenging sectors to reach net-zero emissions.

While the measures outlined in this

to the PES, to reach net zero emissions, 
CO2 capture will be required via CCS, 
bioenergy with carbon capture and 
storage (BECCS), and other carbon 
removal and storage measures.
PES to 2050 –
Reductions 
of 120 million 
tonnes of CO2Energy Scenario (PES), which reflects current plans and policies for the energy sector. Driven by an increasing 
urban population and economic growth, the country’s overall energy demand is expected to grow 2.0% 
annually. However, with deep electrification across all end-use sectors, fuel switching to renewables, and 
energy efficiency measures – as outlined in the TES and the 1.5-S – the total final energy consumption can be 
reduced further by 15% to 22% (Figure 1).
Almost one-fifth of Malaysia’s demand for fuels by 2050 in the 1.5-S will be renewable-based – coming from 
bioenergy, renewable direct-use (such as solar thermal) and hydrogen – a large shift from just 1% today. 
Electricity will comprise up to 40% of final energy consumption, reflecting the additional electricity demand 
required to power the transport sector and green hydrogen production. 
With higher electrification and energy efficiency in the 1.5-S, the country’s total energy consumption will 
be reduced by almost a quarter in the 1.5-S compared to the PES by 2050.

Electricity will become the dominant energy carrier in both the TES and the 1.5-S by 2050, and will become 
the second most important carrier in the PES. Electricity demand is expected to at least double from today’s 
levels to 2050 regardless of the scenario. Therefore, how the country’s power generation capacity is expanded 
to meet this demand will be instrumental in achieving national targets for emission reduction and net zero 
emissions. 
To chart possible alternatives to a continued reliance on fossil fuels in power generation, this report 
presents two highly decarbonised routes forward for the Malaysian power system: a 100% renewables 
system (1.5-S RE100) and one that is around 90% renewable, with the rest relying on carbon capture and 
storage (1.5-S RE90). These cases do not seek to present a singular 1.5-S, but rather show how such a system 
could be achieved based on the technology choices available. Solar PV is key across all scenarios due to 
Malaysia’s abundant solar resources. However, the 100% renewables case calls for very significant expansion Figure 2 Malaysia’s power capacity expansion, 2018 to 2050, under the PES, 1.5-S RE100 and 
1.5-S RE90
From a national perspective, imports of electricity will have a part to play in the future. However, the country has 
an interesting role in providing renewables and flexibility to neighbouring countries, in particular from Sarawak 
and Sabah to Kalimantan (Indonesia) and as far away as the Philippines. From an ASEAN regional perspective, 
an interconnection linking Western and Eastern Malaysia may not be cost effective (for more on regional 
interconnection, see IRENA, 2022). This means that any power deficit in Peninsular Malaysia could be potentially 
supplied mostly by electricity from neighbouring countries, namely from Sumatra, Indonesia (Figure 3).
Domestic transmission as well as regional interconnection will need to be expanded in the 1.5-S.

DiliThiiidd fillttilBdid hthidt ilthiof Sarawak, hydropower reservoirs act as storage, and therefore other technologies are not needed. This also 
has implications for the provision of spinning reserves in the country. Spinning reserves equal to 10% of the 
load can be met at all times by both hydropower and storage without the use of fossil-fuel-based provision. 
Nonetheless, stability protocols need to be redesigned as power systems move from synchronous machines 
to inverter-based generation. Results suggest that inertia available in the system by 2050 would not be 
enough to maintain stability after a hypothetical in-feed loss larger than 2 GW (Figure 4). The system should 
be planned to reliably operate with fewer and fewer synchronous machines in the future, when grid-forming 
inverters are likely to assume the leading role.
Upholding system stability will need to change as operations move from synchronous machines to inverterdominated generation.

Bioenergy will play a role in Malaysia’s energy transition, contributing around 16% of total final consumption 
by 2050 in the 1.5-S (Figure 5). Its application will be mostly as biofuel, for instance in aviation, as well as 
substituting fossil fuels in some industrial sub-sectors, such as the iron and steel, and cement industries. 
To further unlock the potential of bioenergy in Malaysia, it is crucial to have stronger inter-institutional 
co-ordination and strategy that includes bioenergy as part of the energy transition, while also addressing 
sustainability and industrial concerns to scale up potential resources. hydrogen will comprise up to 5% of total final consumption (including non-energy use) in the 1.5-S by 2050, 
where it will play a role in decarbonising some industrial sub-sectors and meeting a growing export market 
for green hydrogen in Asia and the Pacific.
Bioenergy has wide application in end uses, but hydrogen also begins to play a role in the 1.5-S towards 
2050.

Malaysia aims to reach net zero emissions by as early as 2050. If the established measures in the 1.5-S are met 
the country can reduce its energy-sector emissions to only 120 million tonnes of CO2 by 2050, a reduction of 
58% compared to the current pathway (Figure 6). However, carbon offsetting via land use, land-use change 
and forestry (LULUCF) will be instrumental for Malaysia to go the final mile and reach net-zero emissions, 
where other CO2 removal technologies can be considered to further offset remaining emissions.efficiency.

Over the period to 2030, significant investment will need to be directed to renewables, energy efficiency, and 
enabling technologies and infrastructure. In the nearer term, to 2030, more than 17 GW of solar PV will need 
to be installed, requiring investment of USD 10.8 billion (Table 2). Grid expansion will require an investment 
of USD 8 billion to 2030. Electric vehicles will increase to as high as 2.9 million electric cars, with the need for 
over 150 000 public chargers by 2030.TECHNOLOGY 2018 1.5-S IN 2030 TOTAL INVESTMENT

Overall, investments totalling up to USD 415 billion will be required until 2050 in IRENA’s 1.5-S, more than 
two-and-a-half times higher than in the PES. Much of the additional investment (up to 40%) will be needed to 
build renewable power capacity, while one-third will be in grids and flexibility. The remainder will be distributed 
across end-use sectors to increase energy efficiency, scale up electric vehicle charging infrastructure and 
support green hydrogen. When considering the total cost of the energy system (fuel costs, operations and 
maintenance, and financing costs) as well as externalities, the 1.5-S results in lower overall energy system 
costs and additional reduced external costs (Figure 7). environment.

Recommendations
Chapter 5 discusses four key recommendation categories for how to accelerate the energy transition in 
Malaysia. These include energy system and policy planning, regulatory and legal frameworks, technology 
and innovation, and financing. Selected key takeaways include:
Utilise the long-term opportunities of the energy transition – through the development of 
cohesive and integrated long-term energy planning strategies.
Malaysia has taken important steps to transform its energy system to a more secure, clean and 
affordable one in the future. However, more attention is needed to integrate various policies 
for – and beyond – the power sector to achieve a more comprehensive and transparent long-term 
energy policy and planning strategy, aimed at energy transition and achieving climate targets. 
In the short term to 2030, investment of more than USD 26 billion is needed to expand solar PV 
capacity, electric vehicle charging infrastructures and renewable direct-use supply alone.

USD billionDevelop a stronger regulatory framework by enhancing the LSS programme and a wellfunctioning FIT mechanism.
Malaysia’s renewable regulatory framework needs to strengthen the e-bidding system of the 
FIT with respect to project selection criteria and to overcome financing issues. To ensure the 
continued success of the LSS programme, regularity and periodicity are needed for a predictable 
investment environment, and solutions will need to be developed related to land use and grid 
connection issues.
Develop new policy mechanisms for increased participation of various consumers and open 
new renewable energy markets, including using models beyond the traditional PPAs.
It is necessary to develop new policy mechanisms to increase economic viability and to 
encourage the participation of various consumers and clarify the next steps in the rooftop solar 
PV market once the NEM 3.0 has ended. To ensure the success of the NEM programme, new 
business and financing models should be developed beyond the traditional PPA. These should 
be tailored to the economic viability of such systems for various consumer groups, including 
the effective use of voluntary markets such as renewable energy certification and corporate 
sourcing, complemented by an enhanced time-of-use electricity tariff.
Improve system flexibility for cost-effective integration of renewables.
Studies show large potential for the integration of renewables to the grid. Use of Malaysia’s 
significant renewable energy resource potential is limited by grid issues. An ambitious and longterm plan is needed, with an emphasis on specific regions, that shows the extent that renewables 
can be integrated with the transmission grid – including solutions to overcome the current 
integration challenges as well as the flexibility solutions needed to enable this. Flexibility must 
be harnessed in all sectors of the energy system – from power generation, transmission and 
distribution systems, to storage (both electrical and thermal) and increasingly to flexible demand 
(i.e. demand-side management and sector coupling with smart cooling and electric vehicle 
charging systems). In the short term alone (to 2030), the required investment needs total 
USD 4.8 billion in domestic transmission, USD 3.6 billion in distribution and USD 0.02 billion in 
energy storage.
Support enabling technologies in the end-use sectors with a focus on hard-to-abate sectors.
Transforming how end-use sectors consume energy is crucial in enabling a net-zero energy 
system. Attention needs to be paid to challenging sectors, such as transport and industry. 
The government needs to consider programmes that support key enabling technologies in 
these sectors, for instance by focusing on electric vehicles in transport and related charging 
infrastructure. In industry, clean fuels will be required, including support for green hydrogen. 
Wider principles of supporting changes to use habits, wider structural change and circular 
economy should also be considered and supported through government policy.
Accelerate renewable energy finance.
Financing renewable energy investments remains an important barrier to accelerating Malaysia’s 
energy transition. There is a need to assess and understand the barriers and needs of the market 
to develop suitable financing products and models tailored to individual renewable energy 
technologies and to strengthen the capacity of national financing institutions to enable their 
use, coupled with a transparent electricity market design. 
Total energy sector investment needs in the 1.5-S are up to USD 375 to USD 415 billion by 2050, 
more than twice those in the PES. The power sector makes up most of this investment requirement, 
accounting for almost 40% of total investment in the 1.5-S. Within the present decade, total power 
sector investment needs will reach at least USD 30 billion, or around 1.5 times more than in the 
PES. Finance schemes must consider the diverse nature of the investment need, ranging from 
financing large renewable power projects to grids and infrastructure, and from energy efficiency 
in homes and business to biofuel supply and electric vehicle chargers.1.1 COUNTRY BACKGROUND
Malaysia is the third largest country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The country is 
divided into two regions: West Malaysia – also known as Peninsular Malaysia, which is located on the peninsula 
sharing its northern border with Thailand – and East Malaysia, which shares borders with Indonesia and 
Brunei. The states of Labuan, Sabah and Sarawak are situated in East Malaysia. Major cities such as Kuala 
Lumpur and Johor Bahru are located in Peninsular Malaysia, which is also the economic hub of the country. 
More than 32.4 million people were living in Malaysia at the end of 2018 (DOSM, 2021).
Between 2010 and 2021, Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP), in current international purchasing 
power parity (PPP), grew from USD 578 billion to USD 970 billion, reflecting average annual growth of 5.6% 
(World Bank, 2021a). Malaysia’s economy is expected to grow further in the coming years to transition the 
country to high-income level by 2024. 
So far, Malaysia’s strategy to grow its economy has been to diversify towards the manufacturing and service 
sectors. At the end of 2021, exports of goods and services accounted for around 69% of the total gross 
domestic product (GDP) (World Bank, 2021b), whereas imports represented 61.8% (World Bank, 2021c). 
Malaysia’s economic outlook is based on five-year plans, with the 12th Malaysia Plan 2021-2025 focusing on 
strengthening security, wellbeing and inclusivity, and advancing sustainability (GoM, 2021a).
Box 1 The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the Malaysian economy
The first COVID-19 case in Malaysia appeared in early February 2020, followed by an outbreak in March. 
Subsequently the Movement Control Order was introduced, helping to reduce the spread of the virus. Although 
restrictions were eased in May to re-open businesses, a new wave of infections in September resulted in new 
lockdowns in various states until January 2021. A more stringent Movement Control Order was introduced in 
most states, international borders remained closed and overseas travel was restricted until March 2021. 
The pandemic impacted Malaysia’s economy, particularly vulnerable households. The economy contracted 5.8% 
in 2020 but recovered the following year with 3.1% growth in 2021 (BNM, 2022a).
To respond to the pandemic, at the end of June 2021 the Malaysian government unveiled a USD 36 billion stimulus 
package (Shukry and Ngui, 2021). Several measures in the package addressed clean energy investments, 
including: the undertaking of the fourth phase of Malaysia’s Large Scale Solar (LSS) auction scheme for a total 
of 1 GW of capacity; a total of USD 3.1 billion (MYR 13 billion) for the installation of LED streetlighting and the 
installation of rooftop solar PV systems; and investments in new transmission lines. 
Within this package, planned investments in renewable energy capacity totalled USD 3 billion, with the 
investment size of projects ranging from USD 10 million to USD 50 million. Among the estimated benefits from 
these investments are the creation of around 6 000 new jobs and a reduction of 1 million tonnes of carbon 
dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions (EY, 2021).
1INTRODUCTIONgrow. In the past two decades, energy demand has grown by around 3% per year, and growth is estimated 
to average around 1.4% per year until mid-century. Malaysia is traditionally a fossil fuel producer with large 
reserves of oil and natural gas. Although it remains a net exporter of gas and oil, its coal imports have been 
increasing to meet the growing energy demand. 
Meanwhile, renewable energy plays a marginal role in the total primary energy supply, representing around 
3.4% as of 2019, with much of this supplied from traditional hydropower resources (ST, 2022a). Malaysia has 
a huge untapped potential of renewable energy resources that can provide local and affordable alternatives 
to fossil fuels and help to diversify the energy mix. 
1.2 RENEWABLES READINESS ASSESSMENT
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) developed the Renewables Readiness Assessment 
(RRA) as a tool for carrying out comprehensive evaluations of the conditions for renewable energy 
deployment in particular countries. The RRA is a country-led, consultative process. It provides a venue for 
multi-stakeholder dialogue to identify challenges to renewable energy deployment and to devise solutions to 
existing barriers. The assessment presents governments with short- and medium-term recommendations to 
guide the formation of new policies or the reform of existing policies to achieve a more enabling environment 
for renewable energy.
For Malaysia, the RRA process has been led by the Government of Malaysia, with technical support from 
IRENA, and has greatly benefited from stakeholder input. These stakeholders include the Ministry of Natural 
Resource, Environment and Climate Change (NRECC, then known as KeTSA), transmission and distribution 
utilities, power project developers, development partners, financial institutions, civil society and academia. 
The consultative process was initiated at the Government & Internal Stakeholders Consultation Session 
workshop held online on 3 September 2021. The workshop was based on a background paper describing the 
challenges and opportunities for renewable energy development.
During this online event, experts discussed the state of renewable energy in Malaysia as well as various 
challenges and possible solutions. These insights informed a draft report presented in the follow-up validation 
Expert Consultation Workshop with all relevant industry players held on 9 September 2021, which was 
jointly organised by NRECC and IRENA. In addition, the analysis benefited from bilateral interviews with key 
stakeholders.
The RRA process in Malaysia has produced the following outputs:
• an analysis of the existing policy environment and renewable energy market;
• identification of the critical and emerging issues associated with renewable energy development; and
• a set of recommendations for taking advantage of the opportunities revealed by the policy analysis and 
extensive consultations with numerous stakeholders.
The co-ordinated approach employed to produce this RRA helps in setting priorities, in consultation with 
bilateral and multilateral co-operation agencies, financial institutions, and the private sector, for implementing 
the recommended actions.1.3 REMAP AND FLEXTOOL ASSESSMENT
The Renewable Energy Roadmap – or REmap – process is a key pillar of IRENA’s work in assessing the 
energy transition. REmap focuses on energy system analysis to the year 2050 and assesses energy transition 
technologies with an emphasis on renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. REmap consists of 
three levels of analysis: country (e.g. this report), regional (such as the second Renewable Energy Outlook for 
ASEAN) and global (the World Energy Transitions Outlook or WETO) (IRENA, 2022a, 2022b).  
REmap utilises a toolkit that allows for the development of full energy balances covering the whole energy 
system, including energy demand, energy transformation and losses, and primary energy supply. The toolkit 
is based on modules that can be used depending on the specific requirements and data availability of each 
project. The toolkit is a parametric model where future energy demand and supply are assessed based on 
input parameters, such as activity levels, energy service penetration, technology shares and fuel mixes. It is 
a bottom-up approach. These are all exogenous inputs to the model, and energy demand is fully determined 
from those inputs through deterministic model equations. The toolkit does not rely on cost-optimisation nor 
multi-criteria methods. 
The IRENA REmap-FlexTool approach for the design and elaboration of the Malaysia Energy Transition Outlook
aims to create technical pathways focusing on different scenarios and cases. A bottom-up approach analysis 
was carried out for details on the energy demand by end-use sector. This included a substitution analysis on 
technology options for renewables and an assessment of associated costs, investments and benefits in close 
collaboration with country energy experts through a series of multi-stakeholder consultative workshops and 
expert meetings. The power sector was modelled using PLEXOS for capacity expansion, and a flexibility 
assessment was performed using IRENA’s FlexTool product. More information on these models can be found 
in section 4. 
The process of developing the scenarios is a collaborative one involving close consultation with the 
government of Malaysia and other stakeholders in the country. Focal points are appointed, and IRENA 
engages stakeholders through a series of meetings, consultations and discussions to define the scope and 
ambition and to discuss scenario results. Two expert consultation workshops on preliminary demand outlook 
results were held with government stakeholders and larger stakeholders in September 2021.
In addition, the analyses of end-use sectors, the power sector and hydrogen benefited from bilateral meetings 
and inputs with key stakeholders held in 2021 and 2022. These included the Energy Commission (Suruhanjaya 
Tenaga – ST); the electricity suppliers Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd (SESB) and 
Sarawak Energy Berhad (SEB); and the Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Corporation (MGTC). 
A power sector technical discussion was held on 17 March 2022, in which the majority of the stakeholders 
mentioned above participated.
Additionally, IRENA’s Director General, Francesco La Camera, presented early results on the study during a 
keynote speech at the 5th International Sustainable Energy Summit (ISES 2022) in Kuala Lumpur in August 
2022. Preliminary results also were presented at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 27) held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt in November 2022.2.1 ENERGY SECTOR
Malaysia’s total primary energy supply grew by 2.9% in 2019, to reach a total of 4.1 exajoules (EJ) (Figure 8) 
(ST, 2020a, 2021a). All fuels recorded an increase except for coal, which showed a negative growth of 5.5% 
due to lower imports of coal. Natural gas accounted for 42% of the total primary energy supply in 2019, 
followed by crude oil, petroleum and others at 33.3%, coal and coke at 21.4%, and renewables at 3.4%. 
By 2019, renewables share in the total primary energy supply comprises mostly hydropower (2.3%) but also 
small contributions from other renewables (1.1%). Solar energy grew significantly between 2012 and 2020 with 
the rapid expansion of Solar PV installations in the country during the period. Although the use of biofuels is 
increasing rapidly, hydropower continues to make the largest contribution to renewables in the country, with 
a total supply of 93 PJ in 2020.
Malaysia’s energy supply is still heavily dominated by fossil fuels.

& others2019, a total of 4.7 billion barrels of crude oil and condensate reserves existed in the country, spread evenly 
across Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak.1 The country also has large natural gas reserves. As of 
2019, estimated natural gas reserves consisted of 9.9 trillion standard cubic feet (tscf) of associated gas 
and 69.3 tscf of non-associated gas.2 Reserves in Sarawak accounted for more than half of this total (58% 
or 45.8 tscf, followed by Peninsular Malaysia (27%) and Sabah (the remaining 15%). For coal, Malaysia has 
reserves totalling 276 million tonnes of different coal types.3
Over the past decade, total natural gas production in Malaysia has ranged between 2.7 EJ and 3.0 EJ per year. 
Gas is typically exported as liquefied natural gas, with exports reaching 1.2 EJ in 2019; 0.04 PJ of gas was 
exported through pipelines. Imports reached 0.1 PJ for LNG, and 0.2 PJ for pipelines. 
Crude oil production reached around 1.25 EJ in 2019. Malaysia is a net exporter of crude oil, with net export of 
around 0.1 EJ in 2019. However, the country was a net importer of petroleum products (by 0.2 EJ) in 2019, with 
total imports of 17.6 million tonnes of oil equivalent. Malaysia’s refineries processed nearly 1.0 EJ equivalent of 
crude oil, of which two-thirds came from local production. 
Coal production reached around 3.4 million metric tonnes in 2019. Malaysia’s coal imports have been increasing 
steadily and reached 0.8 EJ in 2019. Coal exports are negligible.
The main sources of energy supply in Malaysia are oil and natural gas – with equal shares – followed by coal. 
Three-quarters of all oil supply is for the transport sector. Industry, including non-energy uses, is the second 
largest oil consumer, accounting for 17% of the total oil supply. A small share of oil is also used for electricity 
generation in both centralised power plants as well as for self-generation. 
More than half of all natural gas supply is for industry, followed by electricity generation which uses another 
40% of the total. Coal is supplied mainly for electricity generation (more than 90%), with the rest used mainly 
in industry. 
Box 2 Energy subsidies in Malaysia
Energy subsidies are a long-standing topic in Malaysia and have undergone several reforms in recent decades 
in an effort to balance government spending, natural resource use and economic growth while maintaining 
affordability for consumers. Energy subsidies in the country exist in several forms and have eaten up at least 
7% of the annual GDP during the past decade (Figure 9) (UNSTAT, 2022). 
The largest subsidies are in the transport sector, and consumer prices at petrol and diesel stations in Malaysia 
are among the lowest globally (Murugiah, 2022). Government spending on petroleum subsidies represented 
between 10% and 26% of the government budget between 2004 and 2010; this continued to balloon due to 
rising oil prices, a weakening currency, rapid urbanisation and the 7% average annual growth in demand in 
oil-fuelled transport between 2010 and 2015 (ERIA, 2016; Sulaiman, Harun and Yusuf, 2022; ST, 2021a). 
1 1 barrel of oil equivalent is equivalent to 5.7 gigajoules (GJ) in lower heating value terms.

These energy-related fossil fuel subsidies can be better directed towards investing in renewables 
and energy efficiency.
Figure 9 Estimated energy subsidies in Malaysia, 2010 to 2022
Source: IRENA analysis, estimated from MOF, 2020, 2022; PETRONAS, 2020a.
Fuel subsidies were abolished in late 2014 to take advantage of the decline in global oil prices and were 
followed by a managed floating price mechanism; however, they were reinstated within a few years (MOF, 2022; 
Ngui and Raghu, 2014). Apart from petroleum, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders used by the majority 
of the population for cooking are also largely subsidised. Both petroleum and LPG have been subject to fuel 
smuggling by neighbouring countries (Kojima, 2016) 
Energy is also subsidised through low electricity tariffs in Malaysia, which are among the lowest compared 
to neighbouring countries (Global Petrol Prices, 2022). For example, in the residential sector the first 
300 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month of use is being cross-subsidised at around half of the highest tariff 
(TNB, 2022a) by the commercial and industrial consumer segments. While this is advantageous to lowconsumption consumers, the subsidy is applied for all households regardless of their total electricity use. 
Electricity generation was largely reformed through Malaysian Electricity Supply Industry (MESI) plans 
introduced in 2014 to improve the efficiency, governance and security of the power supply system. Typically, 
fuel supply costs for power plants are managed under supply agreements by TNB Fuel Services (TNBF) for 
coal and by Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) Energy & Gas Trading (PEGT) for oil (OIES-UNITEN, 2021). 
Prior to the liberalisation of the gas market in 2016, natural gas prices supplied from PEGT to power plants were 
regulated at lower market prices, where the foregone revenues reported also can be seen as a form of energy 
subsidy (MGA, 2017; PETRONAS, 2020a).

Energy-related subsidies (billion MYR)Box 2 Energy subsidies in Malaysia (continued)
Today, fuel generation costs are largely governed through the Incentive-based Regulation (IBR) mechanism, 
where any additional costs or savings in power generation relative to the base tariff are revised every six months, 
then passed through to consumers via the Imbalance Cost Pass-Though (ICPT) mechanism, in the form of either 
a surcharge or a rebate to different consumer segments. Total energy subsidies were expected to rise sharply 
again in 2022 due to increases in oil, coal and natural gas prices globally as well as the pressure to maintain a 
low electricity tariff for consumers to manage the cost of living (The Edge, 2022). 
In conclusion, Malaysia has successfully managed to implement several important reforms across the energy 
industry in the past decade to maintain its energy security and fiscal balance; however, it continues to shield 
consumers from the real cost of energy, reflecting changes in global market prices. While targeted subsidies can 
ensure energy affordability to lower- and middle-income households and enable behavioural changes, it is also 
crucial that incentives and investments are directed towards long-term, productive and sustainable uses. These 
include investments in renewables and energy efficiency and creating efficient and effective policy mechanisms 
to solve Malaysia’s energy “trilemma” of energy security, accessibility and sustainability.
Energy consumption
Malaysia’s total final energy consumption in 2019 reached 2.8 EJ, equivalent to 65% of the total primary energy 
supply. Transport is the largest final user of energy, accounting for 38% of the total final energy consumption, 
followed by industry with 28% (Figure 10). When non-energy uses are included, industry becomes the largest 
final energy user with a total share of 50% (DOSM, 2021). 
Given that both the demand for heating and the per capita electricity consumption by households in Malaysia 
are still at low levels, the share of buildings in total energy demand is only around 12%. However, cooling 
demand is relatively high with more than 70% of all households owning an air conditioner (DOSM, 2020a).
The transport sector has dominated Malaysia’s final consumption in the last decade.

Source: ST, 2022a.Three-quarters of all oil is used by transport, with the rest used in industry. Natural gas follows oil with a 
29% share in total final consumption. Meanwhile, coal’s share was only 3%, used mainly for the power sector. 
Industry is the main user of all natural gas and oil for process heat generation. 
Direct use of renewables in Malaysia is minimal with only around a 1% share. This mostly reflects the use of 
biodiesel, which accounts for 1.5% of the total final energy consumption in the transport sector. Electricity’s 
share in total final consumption is 20%. It is the main source of energy in residential and commercial buildings 
(more than 80% of the total), and their total demand covers half of Malaysia’s total electricity demand. The 
other half is used by the industry sector.
2.2 ELECTRICITY SECTOR
Electricity supply and generation
The installed power generation capacity in Malaysia totalled 36.2 gigawatts (GW) in 2019 (ST, 2021a). This 
is dominated mainly by coal and natural gas, while renewables represent 22% of the total installed capacity. 
The regional breakdown of power installed capacity is shown in Figure 11, with Peninsular Malaysia accounting 
for 78% of the total. In Sarawak, hydropower is the dominant electricity supplier, representing 70% of total 
capacity. Of the total 7.8 GW of renewable energy capacity installed in Malaysia as of 2019, 1.2 GW was 
installed through three key schemes: the Feed-In Tariff (FIT), the Large Scale Solar (LSS) programme and the 
Net Energy Metering (NEM) mechanism. 
Malaysia’s installed power generation capacity remains dominated by fossil fuels, with hydropower 
accounting for most of the renewable capacity.

transmission grid. Over the past decade, the country’s total installed hydropower capacity has tripled to 
6 211 MW, although only 14 MW of capacity was added in 2021. A small capacity of mini hydropower plants 
also exists in off-grid systems. 
Grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity reached 1 780 MW in 2021, up from 1 493 MW in 2020. More 
than 7 MW of this capacity was in off-grid systems in 2021. The installed capacity of solid biofuels was large 
between 2013 and 2016 but has since been declining, reaching 774 MW by the end of 2021. By comparison, 
biogas systems are increasing rapidly with a total installed capacity of 120 MW in 2021.
Hydropower has dominated the renewable installed capacity, but solar has become increasingly promising 
in the last few years.
Figure 12 Malaysia’s total installed renewable energy capacity, by source, 2010 to 2021

In Malaysia, electricity capacity is shared between independent power producers (IPPs) and the power 
generation arm of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), Malaysia’s largest electric utility company. Besides 
generation, TNB is also responsible for the transmission and distribution of electricity. The power is procured 
via the Single Buyer units of TNB in Peninsular Malaysia, via Sarawak Energy Berhad (SEB) in Sarawak and 
via Sabah Electricity Sdn. Bhd. (SESB) in Sabah and Labuan (SESB is owned 80% by the TNB and 20% by 
the Sabah State Government). The IPPs in Peninsular Malaysia are licensed by the government to generate 
electricity, and they sell the power according to the terms set out in the power purchase agreements (PPAs).

HydropowerMalaysia (21.2 GW). All coal generators and a large share of natural gas generators were IPPs, whereas nearly 
all hydropower plants belonged to TNB. In Sabah, IPPs (1.1 GW) represented nearly 60% of the grid-connected 
capacity, with the rest split between SESB (0.4 GW) and co-generation, self-generation, FIT and LSS plants. 
In Sarawak, SEB owned 5.2 GW of the total generation assets, with the remaining 0.5 GW split between 
co-generation and self-generation plants.
Electricity generation in Malaysia totalled 176 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2019 (Figure 13). Electricity demand 
has grown at an average annual rate of 5% over the past decade. While hydropower’s share in the electricity 
supply increased from 6% to 15% between 2010 and 2019, coal’s share increased from 34% to 43%, becoming 
the country’s largest source of electricity supply. The total share of renewables was around 17% in 2019; 
however, this share has likely increased since then as a result of the growth in renewable capacity installations 
in the 2020-2021 period through various schemes.
Fossil fuels account for around 80% of Malaysia’s total electricity generation, although this share has fallen 
from around 90% in 2010.
Figure 13 Malaysia’s total electricity output, by source, 2010 to 2019

The electricity consumption by region is proportionate to the installed capacity and is highest in Peninsular 
Malaysia (Figure 14). The current reserve margin (percentage of available unused capacity of an electrical 
power system to meet its peak demand) in Peninsular Malaysia reached 38% in 2019 and 52% in 2021; 
according to the region’s master plan to 2039, the aim is to reduce this to 21% (ST, 2021b). The reserve margin 
declined in Sabah and Labuan, falling from 29% to 23% between 2018 and 2019 (ST, 2020b).

Transmission and distribution grid
Malaysia has three major electricity grids: the national grid on Peninsular Malaysia, the Sabah grid (on Borneo) 
and the Sarawak grid (also on Borneo). The transmission voltage networks include grids of 500 kilovolts (kV), 
275 kV and 132 kV. The supply frequency is 50 hertz (Hz). The utilities and boundaries for each of the three 
grids is shown in Figure 15, where TNB is responsible for Peninsular Malaysia, SESB for Sabah and SEB for 
Sarawak. 
The Malaysian electricity grid can be broadly broken down into three major grids.

Disclaimer: This map is provided for illustration purposes only. Boundaries and names shown on this map do not imply the expression 
of any opinion on the part of IRENA concerning the status of any region, country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or half of the total grid. The transmission grid has a total of 407 sub-stations, with a combined capacity of 
115 120 megavolt amperes (MVA). The TNB distribution grid covers a total 352 565 kilometres of overhead lines 
and 307 474 kilometres of underground cables. A total of 81 327 sub-stations serve the distribution grid, with 
a combined capacity of 114 089 MVA. 
The SESB transmission grid has 66 kV lines. The total length of the grid is 2 288 kilometres, and a 132 kV 
grid network represents nearly the entire capacity. A total of 45 sub-stations serve the grid with a combined 
capacity of 5 049 MVA. The SESB distribution grid uses mainly overhead lines with a total length of 
9 465 kilometres. Underground cables cover a total length of 1109 kilometres, and the grid’s 7 957 sub-stations 
have a total capacity of 5 440 MVA. 
The SEB transmission grid has a total length of more than 4 400 kilometres, with 275 kV lines covering more 
than 2 800 kilometres of this. A total of 37 transmission sub-stations have a combined capacity of 10 246 MVA. 
The SEB distribution grid has 26 236 kilometres of overhead lines and 8 769 kilometres of underground cables. 
A total of 13 824 distribution sub-stations have a combined capacity of 9 600 MVA. 
The distribution grid voltages of Malaysia comprise 33 kV, 11 kV and 415/240 volts (ST, 2021a).
Electricity trading
The national grid is connected to Thailand’s grid to the north with a total capacity of 380 MW (commissioned 
in 2002), comprising a 300 kV high-voltage DC line with 300 MW capacity from Gurun to Khlong Ngae and 
a 132 kV AC line with 80 MW capacity from Bukit Ketri to Sadao. There is also interconnection to Singapore’s 
main grid to the south with a total capacity of 450 MW (commissioned in 1985) that has since been upgraded 
to two 550 MVA of high-voltage AC. The total interconnection capacity of Malaysia is only around 2% of the 
total installed capacity.
The ASEAN Interconnection Masterplan Study (AIMS) III covering the period until 2040 updates the previous 
version and emphasises that around 20 GW of interconnection capacity would be needed by 2025 in the 
Southeast Asia region (USAID, 2021). In September 2014, the governments of the Lao People’s Democratic 
Republic (Lao PDR), Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore released a joint statement to initiate a pilot project 
for facilitating cross-border electricity trade. Power would flow from Lao PDR to Singapore via Thailand and 
Malaysia. The four countries agreed to form a working group to assess the viability of trading up to 100 MW 
through the existing interconnector capacity. 
The commitment to the implementation of the joint statement plan was reaffirmed in November 2020 
(MTI, 2020). Phase 1 commenced on 1 January 2018. Malaysia purchased electricity from Lao PDR through 
Thailand as a wheeling country based on a predefined price and quantity. The second phase expanded Lao 
PDR’s electricity export from 100 MW to a maximum of 300 MW. Commenced on 23 June 2022, Singapore 
signed power purchase agreement with Lao PDR, that will allow import up to 100 MW of renewable hydropower 
from Lao PDR to Singapore via Thailand and Malaysia using existing interconnection. As the only multilateral 
power trade agreement in the Southeast Asia region, the pilot project demonstrated that such trade in the 
region is possible.
Thailand and Malaysia are conducting a joint study to increase the capacity of interconnection between the 
two countries. One option they are considering is developing two new interconnections: a 300 kV line with a 
total power transfer capacity of 300 MW and a 132/115 kV line with a total capacity of 100 MW. In addition, a 
new 600 MW interconnection line with Indonesia has been proposed and was expected to be commissioned 
after 2021, although the project was postponed as Indonesia decided to focus on its domestic priorities. The 
SEB has plans to expand transmission towards the hydro resource rich regions of Baleh and MurumThis 2.3 INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE
Key institutions
The Economic Planning Unit of the Prime Minister’s Department is responsible for development planning, 
which builds on the close engagement of various stakeholders from government entities (at both the federal 
and state levels), businesses, civil society and other relevant actors.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change (NRECC), formerly known as the Ministry 
of Energy and Natural Resources (KeTSA), manages the supply of electricity, with the objective of optimising 
renewable energy and energy efficiency to ensure reliable, affordable and sustainable electricity supply 
services. The ministry develops related policies, strategies and legislation and enforces laws. 
The Energy Commission (Suruhanjaya Tenaga, ST) is responsible for regulation of all electricity and gas issues 
in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah. The ST reports to NRECC and is responsible for policy matters concerning 
the supply of energy; the generation, transmission, distribution and the use of electricity and gas; promoting 
renewable energy use and energy efficiency measures and research in these areas; and safeguarding the 
operations of competition and fairness and efficiency in the energy markets. The ST also works closely with 
the Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA), which was formed under the Sustainable Energy 
Development Authority Act of 2011 to administer and manage the implementation of the FIT under the 
Renewable Energy Act of 2011 (GoM, 2011). 
Structure of the power sector
Since Malaysia’s independence in 1957, the power system has been undergoing continuous change. The 
following institutions have been established:
• Central Electricity Board (1949)
• National Electricity Board (1965)
• Tenaga Nasional Berhad (1990), the successor to the National Electricity Board
• Suruhanjaya Tenaga (2002), taking over the role of the Department of Electricity and Gas Supply.
Malaysia’s market is a managed model in where the generation sector is open for participation, consisting 
of large independent power producers and state-owned utilities. The upstream market is more competitive, 
allowing the participation of both local and foreign power producers. For renewable energy generation 
projections, there is a competitive bidding process through numerous schemes further elaborated in the 
report.
The Malaysia Electricity Supply Industry (MESI) 1.0 initiative, introduced in 2009, aimed to transform the 
power sector between 2010 and 2014 through an improved tariff mechanism, fuel supply and security, and 
governance for the effectiveness of the power sector. As a result of the MESI 1.0 initiative, the Single Buyer 
model was established in Peninsular Malaysia within the TNB in September 2012 based on the Electricity 
Supply Act (1990) (OIES-UNITEN, 2021). According to this model, the Single Buyer is responsible for the 
procurement of electricity from all generators, and it also plans for the dispatch based on a least-cost 
approach by considering constraints in the generation and transmission capacity in line with the Grid Code. system in 2015, which allowed merchant generators to supply power to the grid without necessarily entering 
a PPA. NEDA is designed to enhance short-run competition (based on scheduling and dispatch) and cost 
efficiency as well as to incentivise the power generators to be more efficient; it arranges the scheduling and 
dispatch of generation used by the Single Buyer (ST, 2020b). According to NEDA, power plant generators bid 
daily against each other based on their variable costs following the rules set by the ST. In May 2019, NEDA 
started including solar power plants as a new category.
The competition takes place under PPAs, which IPPs secure with TNB for a contract duration of 21 years for 
gas-fired power plants and 25 years for coal-fired plants. The contracts require power plants to be always 
available. The payments by the Single Buyer to generators under the PPA arrangement include an energy 
payment and a capacity payment. 
For renewable energy PPAs that are applicable for the FIT and LSS mechanisms, the take-and-pay principle 
is applied for a period of 21 years. This means that the off-taker accepts the supplied electricity whenever it is 
available. In current renewable energy PPAs under the LSS mechanism, capacity payment is not applied since 
solar is not a dispatchable resource. In PPAs there are no linkages to inflation or currency changes for a fixed 
period of 21 years. 
In September 2019, the Malaysian government approved the 10-year MESI 2.0 master plan with the objective 
to open the market to diversity and competition to improve its flexibility and cost efficiency and to empower 
consumers (ST, 2020b). Key reform measures of the MESI 2.0 include: to allow generators to source for their 
own fuel to optimise cost; move from the PPA regime to capacity and energy markets; establish a thirdparty access framework and network charges for the grid to allow third parties to use the infrastructure; 
and, facilitate green energy producers and consumers. A key objective is to have market-based competition, 
whereas in the current model which sees competition exists only at the generation level. An additional 
objective is to promote trade across borders with neighbouring ASEAN countries to enhance the efficiency 
of operations. 
In November 2021, a Green Electricity Tariff was launched, where subscribers can opt in to use electricity 
generated from renewable resources by providing an additional payment per kWh; subscribers also receive a 
renewable energy certificate (Aziz, 2021).
Additionally, the government announced the Corporate Green Power Programme (CGPP) in late 2022, where 
the private sector can undertake a corporate PPA with a solar PV producer, further incentivising the uptake 
of renewables (ST, 2022b). The CGPP also encourages the trading of renewable energy certificates between 
both parties, fulfilling their environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) commitments.
2.4 STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK
Malaysia has implemented several major energy policies. The Electricity Supply Act was introduced in 1990 
and then amended in 2015. The Energy Commission Act was introduced in 2001 and later amended in 2010. 
The National Renewable Energy Policy and Action Plan was introduced in 2010, the same year as the Malaysia 
New Energy Policy. The SEDA and Renewable Energy Acts followed in 2011. In 2015, the National Energy 
Efficiency Action Plan was introduced.National Biofuel Policy enforced in 2006. Blending biofuels for road transport started in 2010, and in five years 
the biodiesel blending rate reached 7%. Malaysia’s biodiesel now caters to both the domestic market and the 
export market, and a blending mandate of B10 (10% biodiesel) is used for the road transport sector and B7 
for industrial use (Wahab, 2021). A B20 blending target was planned in 2020 but was delayed due to supply 
chain issues that were further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. A wider National Biomass Industry 
Action Plan was also developed, aiming for energy-intensive industries to increase the share of biomass in 
their energy use (GoM, 2013).
The Green Technology Master Plan, introduced in 2017, covers the period to 2030. In this plan, Malaysia aims 
to increase the renewable energy capacity in the total generation mix to 20% by 2020 (2 080 MW, excluding 
large hydropower), 23% by 2025 and 30% by 2030 (4 000 MW). 
The Malaysia Renewable Energy Roadmap (MyRER), launched at the end of 2021, outlines strategies and 
provides an action plan to reach the target of 40% renewable energy installed capacity or 18 GW by 2035; 
under its “New Capacity Target” Scenario, 7.3 GW is projected to be solar PV (SEDA, 2021a).
Box 3 Malaysia’s climate policy and net zero targets
Malaysia’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), submitted to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015, aimed for a 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emission 
intensity (tonnes of CO2 emissions per unit of GDP) by 2030 relative to 2005. This is split between an 
unconditional target of 35% and a conditional target of 10% if the country receives climate finance, technology 
transfer and capacity building from developed countries (GoM, 2015). 
In July 2021, the cabinet approved raising the unconditional target to 45%, representing an increase of 10 
percentage points from the previous version of the NDC (GoM, 2020a, 2021b). In September 2021, Malaysia’s 
Prime Minister announced a goal for the country to become carbon neutral as early as 2050, alongside a 
commitment to stop building new coal-fired power plants post 2040 (Salim, 2021).
In 2016, the Malaysian state-owned oil and gas company, PETRONAS, aimed to become a net zero emitter of 
greenhouse gases by 2050, and the company also announced that it will increase renewable energy investments. 
In a press release issued on 5 November 2020, PETRONAS stated that it will continue to intensify its efforts 
towards reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from its assets by delivering continuous improvements in 
operational excellence and by deploying innovative operations and technologies (PETRONAS, 2020b).
Malaysia’s second largest lender by assets (CIMB) has committed to phase out coal from its portfolio by 2040 
and to end funding for new coal mines and generators as early as 2021 (Reuters, 2020). In August 2021, TNB 
announced its aspirations to become net zero by 2050, by adopting a sustainable pathway to reduce its emission 
intensity by 35% and to halve its coal generation capacity by 2035 (TNB, 2021a). Additionally, the national 
investment arms such as Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) and Khazanah Nasional have committed to net 
zero targets by 2050, aiming for greener portfolios and investments (Khazanah, 2022; PNB, 2022).
On 9 December 2022, Bursa Malaysia launched the Bursa Carbon Exchange (BCX) as a voluntary carbon market 
aimed at enabling companies to trade voluntary carbon credits from climate-friendly projects and solutions 
to offset their emission footprint and meet climate goals. The first auction is expected to start in March 2023; 
projects permitted to be traded include nature-based and technology-based solutions that help avoid, reduce 
or remove GHG emissions (Bursa Malaysia, 2022).has set a target for 20% renewable energy capacity by 2025 (ST, 2021b) and has announced its aspirations 
to become net zero by 2050, by adopting a sustainable pathway to reduce its emission intensity by 35% and 
halve coal generation capacity by 2035. Other goals from the government include the use of the IncentiveBased Regulation (IBR) mechanism (a tariff price-setting mechanism for affordable and secure energy supply 
in a deregulated market), an optimal generation expansion plan (to improve service reliability at minimal cost), 
least-cost dispatch (to promote market liberalisation to reduce transmission and distribution costs) and fuel 
portfolio diversification (to balance affordable electricity and energy security).
Renewable energy generation in Peninsular Malaysia covers solid waste, small hydropower, biomass, biogas, 
geothermal and solar. Large hydropower plants (more than 100 MW capacity) are not considered to be 
renewable energy. TNB’s target of 20% renewable energy capacity by 2025 focuses on increasing solar 
generation capacity while also creating new business opportunities for big companies, small and medium 
enterprises, microbusinesses and households. 
The latest generation development plan of Peninsular Malaysia, covering the 2021-2039 period, aims for a 31% 
share of renewable energy capacity by 2025, raising the initial target of 20% (excluding large hydropower 
plants) (ST, 2021b). The renewable share in the capacity mix is projected to increase to 40% by 2035. This 
will require an additional 1 178 MW of new capacity to be installed in Peninsular Malaysia by 2025 – of which 
the majority will be solar PV – followed by 2 414 MW between 2026 and 2035. The total installed renewable 
energy capacity would reach 8 531 MW by 2025 and 10 944 MW by 2035. 
Under the plan, the share of coal is estimated to decline from 37% in 2021 to 22% in 2039, while natural gas' 
share is expected to increase slightly from 45% to 47%. The 31% share of renewables would include a 26% 
contribution from Peninsular Malaysia (from a total of 8 531 MW of capacity) and 5% from East Malaysia. 
Although the energy sector has perceived this to be an ambitious target, in view of the country’s significant 
resource potential much more could be done – which will also provide investment opportunities.
Sabah grid goals are slightly different, as the grid faces limitations from a significant reliance on natural gas by 
an ageing fleet. There are also challenges to renewable energy development and planning. The government 
highly subsidises the electricity supplied in the grid (further discussion can be found in Box 2 on Energy 
Subsidies in Malaysia). The Sabah grid aims to develop solutions to overcome these challenges in order to 
ensure a secure supply of electricity to meet growing demand. The Sabah grid aims to improve the electricity 
supply with grid expansion and interconnection investments. Additionally, it seeks to increase the share of 
renewables, notably solar PV plants, which will also help to reduce the greenhouse gas emission intensity. 
As implemented in Peninsular Malaysia, the Sabah grid aims to introduce the IBR. In addition, in 2019 the 
energy ministry announced the target of achieving a 20% renewable energy share in the Sabah grid by 
2025 as well as savings of 8% through energy efficiency initiatives by the same period. Specific to the Sabah 
grid, planning for micro-grid frameworks and project monitoring for rural electrification are also part of the 
initiatives (ST, 2019).

Feed-in tariff mechanism
Between 2001 and 2008, the impact of the Small Renewable Energy Power (SREP) Programme was limited. As 
a result, the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water (then KeTTHA, now NRECC) developed a more 
comprehensive programme that resulted in the National Renewable Energy Policy and Action Plan (NREPAP). 
Two bills were drafted subsequently in 2011, namely the Renewable Energy Act and the SEDA Act. These acts 
led to the implementation in 2011 of the feed-in tariff mechanism, which is executed by the SEDA. The FIT was 
initially established in Peninsular Malaysia, but its scope was subsequently expanded in early 2014 to include 
Sabah and Labuan.
The FIT is financed by the Renewable Energy Fund established under the Renewable Energy Act. The fund 
is generated through the collection of a 1.6% surcharge in the electricity bill (consumers in Sarawak are 
excluded), which is also the current FIT rate. Domestic consumers whose monthly electricity use is below 
300 kWh are exempted from contributing to the Renewable Energy Fund; otherwise surcharges are imposed 
on all residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The contribution is mandatory only during times when 
the FIT mechanism is in place. 
The FITs range over a 21-year period for solar PV plants and mini hydropower plants, and 16 years for biomass 
and biogas. Existing renewable power plants under the existing SREP under the Renewable Energy Act 
2011 were allowed to convert to the current FIT mechanism. FIT rates have changed on the basis of annual 
degression rates since 2013. The annual degression rate for solar PV is 10% and has been in effect since 2014 
for capacity below 24 kW. FIT eligibility criteria limit the total installed capacity of power plants to 30 MW.

• Revised degression for solar PV starting in 2014
• Establishment of a FIT for geothermal projects for up to 30 MW, starting in 2015, to support scaled-up 
development of this largely untapped resource in Malaysia
• Launch of the net metering (NEM) programme in January 2016 to complement Malaysia’s solar PV FIT 
policy (the FIT for solar PV was later replaced entirely with the NEM programme at the end of 2017). 
By 2021, SEDA had awarded feed-in tariff (FIT) quotas totalling 174 672 megawatts (MW) for biogas, biomass, 
and small hydro resources to 34 companies. In 2021 alone, projects under the FIT had generated a total of 
1.35 TWh. This included 33% solar PV, 12% biomass, 34% biogas and 21% small hydropower.
Large Scale Solar (LSS) programme
The LSS programme, based on a bidding process, was introduced in 2016 by the ST with a total quota of 
1 250 MW allocated for the 2017-2020 period. Of this, 250 MW was directly awarded under the fast-track 
programme. The remaining 1 000 MW falls under the bidding mechanism. By the end of 2022, there were four 
rounds of LSS bidding that had taken place. 
During the first 50 MW-size project, several challenges occurred during construction and operation, including 
changes in requirements during bids and construction, and delays in getting approval from authorities. 
Additionally, fluctuations in the local currency led to higher project costs (Abdullah et al., 2019), usually as 
a result of higher material procurement costs. After the second round of the LSS, there were difficulties 
in obtaining the development order, as the multiple processes within state governments delayed project 
implementation. The government has taken actions to address issues experienced during the first and second 
rounds of the LSS.
In August 2017, the ST announced the bid open price for LSS solar PV plants for 2019-2020. The results showed 
that the lowest bid received was in the 10 MW to 30 MW category, with a tariff of USD 0.079 (MYR 0.3398) 
per kWh (ST, 2021c).The first round of the LSS tender was designed in similar fashion but with the high end 
of the categories reaching up to 50 MW capacity in Peninsular Malaysia and 10 MW in Sabah/Labuan. Of the 
total capacity awarded in the first and second rounds of the LSS, most was located in Perlis, which has higher 
solar irradiation compared to the rest of the country.
The third round of the LSS attracted 112 bids, for more than 6.73 GW of generation capacity (oversubscribed 
above 500 MW), and with a lowest solar energy price of USD 0.042 (MYR 0.178) per kWh from a 100 MW 
scale project in 2019. However, the ST shortlisted only five bidders, for a total generation capacity of 490 MW 
(ST, 2021c). 
The fourth round of the LSS took place in March 2021. The bid where plants are planned to be commissioned in 
2022 and 2023 attracted projects with bids as low as USD 0.043 (MYR 0.177) per kWh. A total of 30 projects 
were pre-selected by the government with a combined 823 MW of electricity generation capacity (PV magazine, 
2021). A summary of LSS programme outcomes is provided in Figure 17. Figure 17 Large Scale Solar (LSS) program and lowest bid prices in Malaysia, 2016 to 2020

The continuing decline in prices achieved in the four distinct bidding LSS rounds showed that renewables are 
gaining a business case in Malaysia. The last two rounds of LSS where oversubscribed by up to 5 and 13 times 
from the original auction capacity, showing that there is a great interest from project developers and further 
expansion potential for utility-scale solar (IRENA, 2022c). The tendering guidelines of the LSS have improved 
greatly, and more criteria are now included to ensure that projects are successfully delivered in time for their 
commercial operation date. 
Details on the auction design and results in Malaysia can be found in IRENA’s publication Renewable energy 
auctions: Southeast Asia (IRENA, 2022c).  
Net Energy Metering (NEM) programme
The NEM is executed by the energy ministry and regulated by the ST, with SEDA as the implementing agency. 
A total of 500 MW of capacity was planned to be reached by the end of 2020 by domestic, commercial and 
industrial users. The NEM prioritises self-consumption and any surplus to be exported and sold to the utility 
at a displaced cost. Initially, progress in the NEM was slow. As of late 2018, the NEM scheme had received 520 
applications with a total capacity of 27.8 MW, and 223 projects with a total capacity of 9.0 MW had started 
operation. This left a balance of 472.2 MW of NEM quota available until the end of 2020.
In October 2018, NEM 2.0 was announced, which allowed excess solar electricity to be compensated on a 
one-on-one basis instead of the displaced cost, effective in early 2019. NEM 2.0 was aimed at TNB customers 
only, including agricultural consumers (SEDA, 2018). At the start of 2020, a total of 94 MW of new rooftop 
solar PV capacity was installed until the end of November 2019, far more than the 14 MW installed capacity 
achieved in the first NEM program that ran between 2016 to 2018. The total installed capacity was split into 
75 MW for industrial installations, 25 MW for commercial systems, 7.7 MW for residential systems and 130 kW 
for agricultural projects (Bellini, 2020).until the end of 2023, with a total quota of 500 MW. NEM 3.0 introduced three new initiatives: NEM Rakyat 
(residential customers), with a total capacity of 100 MW; NEM GoMEn (Government Ministries and Entities), 
aimed at lowering the electricity bills of government buildings and offices through a 100 MW quota; and 
NEM NOVA, targeted at commercial and industrial consumers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with an 
allocated quota of 300 MW. As a continuation from the NEM 2.0 period, customers can choose to purchase 
solar electricity through signing a PPA, through a solar leasing programme or through a hybrid of both, as 
offered by solar investors.
There are four principal modes for financing rooftop solar PV systems, as seen in Figure 16. Through the 
NEM programme and a self-consumption business model, electricity consumers have an additional choice of 
financing solar PV systems either through solar leasing, signing a PPA, or a mix of both known as a hybrid PPA.
In the hybrid PPA, upfront payment is negotiable and is based on agreement between the investor and the 
consumer. The payment in energy is in MYR per kWh. The system is owned by the investor, the installation 
is done by the investor’s contractor, and at the end of the contract period the system is handed over to the 
customer. This is different in the leasing model, where the system is owned after the leasing period ends, while 
the installation model is identical with the PPA model. In the leasing model, the payment is done monthly in 
MYR. The difference between leasing and a PPA is that leasing is based on a fixed monthly payment, while a 
PPA entails paying per solar energy produced (typically the solar tariff is fixed).
New renewable energy markets
Corporate PPAs could be a new option to sell power directly to end users, and there is significant interest 
in this model from investors. Enabling corporate PPAs will require overcoming the power wheeling charges. 
In addition, rooftop solar PV and small hydropower plants have shown interest in peer-to-peer electricity 
trading, where a pilot project was implemented by SEDA. This could be an interesting option in particular 
following the end of the NEM 3.0 in 2023. The Corporate Green Power Programme (CGPP) which use virtual 
Power Purchase Agreement Mechanism was introduced in November 2022 with quota of 600MW. The 
objective of CGPP is to enable corporate companies operating in Malaysia to achieve environmental, social 
and governance commitment.
In Malaysia, renewable energy certificates have been offered by TNB through the Green Electricity Tariff 
since the end of 2022, after the myGreen+ scheme was discontinued (ST, 2021d). Certificates are gaining 
traction in the country by companies seeking to fulfil their environmental sustainability goals. The mechanism 
requires subscribers to pay an additional amount for the certificate on top of the regulated tariff. To date, all 
the available renewable energy generation offered on the scheme (4.5 gigawatt-hours a month) has been 
subscribed (MGATS, 2022).
2.6 ENERGY TARIFFS
Malaysia’s electricity tariff is one of the lowest in Southeast Asia, as shown in Figure 18. Electricity is sold to 
consumers at fixed tariff rates that are approved by the government and regulated by the ST. In general, tariffs 
are categorised according to the sector (residential, commercial and industrial) and are based on the level of 
consumption and on the supply voltage level (TNB, 2022b). Figure 18 Regional comparison of electricity prices for the business sector

For the residential sector, electricity tariffs are priced according to blocks of 300 kWh, 200 kWh and 
100 kWh with increasing prices from USD 0.046 to USD 0.12 per kWh. The commercial and industrial sectors 
enjoy tariffs between USD 0.07 and USD 0.11 per kWh, with a much lower tariff during off-peak hours 
(around USD 0.04 per kWh) (TNB, 2022a).
In December 2017, the government introduced the Incentive-Based Regulation (IBR) mechanism to be 
further implemented in Peninsular Malaysia for Regulatory Period 2 (RP2), in effect from 1 January 2018 to 
31 December 2020. The IBR mechanism is a tariff price-setting mechanism for affordable and secure energy 
supply in a deregulated market. It allows utility companies to earn a reasonable return on power sector 
investment, through the implementation of an Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) mechanism, allowing 
any increase of costs beyond the base tariff (see Figure 19) to be adjusted as a surcharge or rebate on the 
consumer’s electricity tariff every six months (Energy Watch, 2019).Figure 19 Overview of tariff structure before and after the Incentive-Based Regulation

In Malaysia, electricity generation costs, including fuel costs, comprise around 70% of the base electricity 
tariff. Due to the rise in coal and gas prices in 2022, the country’s power generation costs are expected to 
increase four- to five-fold compared to the previous year (TNB, 2022c). This led to additional ICPT surcharges 
being passed on to commercial and industrial consumers in 2022 (TNB, 2022d).
Enhanced Time of Use (ETOU) scheme 
The Enhanced Time of Use (ETOU) tariff scheme was introduced to encourage demand-side management, 
allowing customers to manage their electric consumption efficiently by using less electricity during peak 
hours. The ETOU are offered as an option for eligible customers, mainly targeted towards commercial and 
industrial consumers. (TNB, 2021b). 
Under this scheme, there are three time zones for energy charges, with Peak, Mid-Peak and Off-Peak rates. By 
comparison, the Maximum Demand charge had two time zones, with Peak and Mid-Peak rates. The scheme is 
also divided as follows: Monday to Friday and Saturday, Sunday and Public Holidays (Enhanced Time of Use, 
2021). The peak hours are from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. according to the TOU tariff. The ETOU tariff has three time 
zones (Peak, Mid-Peak and Off-Peak) for Monday to Friday, and only one time zone (Off-Peak) applied on 
Saturday, Sunday and Public Holidays (Figure 20).using less electricity during peak hours.

Peak Mid-peak O-peak3.1 DRIVERS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEPLOYMENT
Diversifying the resource base to supply increasing energy demand and maintain energy security emerges 
as a priority area for Malaysia. Over the past decade, the country’s total primary energy supply has grown 
at an average annual rate of 3%, and the energy mix relies predominantly on fossil fuels. While Malaysia has 
traditionally been a producer and net exporter of fossil fuels, this trade balance could shift towards greater 
dependence on fossil fuel imports. The country’s energy strategy has so far prioritised the use of local fossil 
fuels to supply the growing energy demand, and coal is currently the largest source of electricity supply. The 
new net zero plan for the electricity sector puts much greater emphasis on renewable energy for the coming 
decade, yet the overall energy system still lacks a clear net zero emission transition pathway for the long term. 
The energy sector has made crucial advances to enable privatisation of the power sector. Additionally, the 
role for consumers in the power system will increase as the energy system becomes more distributed, notably 
through the deployment of rooftop solar PV and as electric vehicles gain more importance, allowing for smart 
charging and the coupling of end-use sectors with the power system. This is in line with Malaysia’s Low Carbon 
Mobility Blueprint 2021-2030, which targets electric vehicle shares to reach 5% for cars, 15% for motorcycles 
and 20% for buses by 2030 (KASA, 2021). 
A more advanced green recovery plan can accelerate Malaysia’s transition to a more renewable energy system 
to utilise the country’s untapped renewable potential and put it on a climate-neutral pathway in the long term, 
while providing further social and economic benefits. In 2019, Malaysia’s labour force participation rate was 
68.7% and its unemployment rate was 3.3% (DOSM, 2020b). With regards to the labour market, upskilling 
and reskilling the local population in high-tech and value-added industries, including in renewable energy is 
necessary to decrease widening inequality as well contributing to economic value to Malaysia.
While inequality between the more vulnerable “bottom 40” of the population has only widened in the last 
decade, such household income classifications need to be revised to reflect reality on the ground for a more 
robust social assistance programme (Jomo and Hawati, 2020). In addition, the high share of young people 
in the rapidly growing population underscores the importance of identifying new areas of economic activity 
and employment. 
The creation of a local renewable energy sector is therefore of utmost importance. SEDA has estimated 
that around 54 900 people were working in Malaysia’s solar PV sector in 2019, and IRENA calculates a 
further 100 900 jobs in the agricultural supply chain for biodiesel that year. Altogether, IRENA estimates that 
Malaysia’s renewable energy workforce totalled 187 000 in 2019 (IRENA, 2020). According to these estimates, 
Malaysia has the second largest workforce in the solar PV sector among ASEAN countries, after Vietnam. It 
ranks third in jobs in the liquid biofuels sector, following Indonesia and Thailand.

3.2 CURRENT STATUS AND POTENTIAL
Malaysia has strong renewable energy potential (Figure 21). Because it is located close to the equator, 
it has high solar irradiation throughout the year. The highest irradiation is found in Kota Kinabalu, at 
1 900 kWh per square metre (m2), followed by Bayan Lepas (1 809 kWh/m2/year) and Georgetown 
(1 785 kWh/m2/year) (Abdullah et al., 2019). Annual average wind speeds are relatively low, but the Indian 
Ocean and the South China Sea provide good wind streams. The monthly mean wind speed is between 
1.5 and 4.5 metres per second (m/s), although higher-altitude areas can achieve speeds between 9 and 11 m/s. 
In Peninsular Malaysia, Mersing, Johor and Kuala Terengganu are suitable areas for wind power. In East 
Malaysia, Kudat and Sabah are the highest wind potential areas. Generally, the southern part of Peninsular 
Malaysia has more wind potential (Ibrahim et al., 2015; Islam, 2011). Malaysia also has high rainfalls and is rich 
in hydropower potential, particularly for small hydropower plants with capacities below 30 MW. 
Malaysia possesses considerable solar and wind energy resources.

plantation area has expanded more than a hundred times. Mills span the entire territory, including 76 largescale mills that can process 250 000 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches annually. Biomass plays an important 
role in Malaysia’s energy mix but has not achieved its full potential due mainly to the uncertainty of biomass 
feedstock supply and other technical, financial and policy barriers (Salleh et al., 2020). Biogas could offer 
large potential, coming mainly from municipal solid waste, food waste, cattle manure, sewage and palm oil 
mill effluent (POME). With approximately potential of 2.3 GW, biomass constitutes the largest resources in 
Malaysia. Peninsular Malaysia accounts for 1.3 GW, Sabah with 561 MW and Sarawak with 448 MW. Biogas 
and municipal solid waste also have promising potential, with total of 736 MW and 516 MW respectively 
(See Figure 22).
Malaysia has a diverse mix of bioenergy potential.

3.3 ECONOMICS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY
According to the IRENA cost database, Malaysia is among the countries with good solar irradiation, and since 
2013 it has benefited from increasingly competitive total installed costs for residential solar PV systems. As a 
low-cost market, the levelised cost of electricity for solar PV in Malaysia fell more than 50% between 2013 and 
2019, from USD 0.187 per kWh to USD 0.089 per kWh. Data for commercial rooftop solar PV systems shows a 
comparable decline from USD 0.175 to USD 0.078 per kWh. This trend is in line with reductions in the capital 
costs of solar PV systems, which are now below USD 900 per kW in the commercial sector and just above 
USD 1 000 per kW in the residential sector (IRENA, 2021b).
A study from 2019 prepared by the ASEAN Center for Energy (ACE) provides several data points to the 
levelised cost of electricity generation in Malaysia from renewable energy sources. According to the study 
that covers the TNB area in Malaysia, biomass-fired power plants with capacity factors of around 86% had 
generation costs slightly above the TNB average at USD 0.11 per kWh. Solar PV plants with capacity factors 
above 10% are estimated to have levelised cost of electricity ranging from as low as USD 0.10/kWh to as high 
as USD 028/kWhIn the same studya limited number of data points for Malaysia reveals generation costs

Biogassolar PV range is comparable with the household electricity tariffs in Malaysia at USD 9.3/kWh. Capital costs 
of hydropower plants range from USD 1,350 to USD 3,000 per kW. According to the same study the operation 
and maintenance costs of hydropower plants are on average 2% of the total capital costs whereas the solar PV 
plants’ costs of operation and maintenance are on average 1.5% of the total capital costs. The capital costs of 
biomass plants are on average USD 2 200/kW with operation and maintenance costs averaging above 5% of 
the total capital costs. The fuel costs of biomass plants are between million USD 6.4 and USD 17.8 per tonne 
(ACE, 2019).
3.4 GRID INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLES
Given Malaysia’s large renewable energy resource availability, there is a realistic potential for the renewable 
share in the total generation capacity to go beyond what is already planned. This will be important in light 
of the country’s dispersed population centres and economic activity. Additional measures to ensure system 
flexibility may be required. There is limited country-wide analysis investigating the extent to which the 
transmission grid can accommodate renewable energy resources. A study undertaken in 2018 for Peninsular 
Malaysia shows that by 2025, solar energy penetration of up to 27% (as a share of peak demand) is technically 
possible in the system with no significant technical impacts to the system operation albeit comes with cost 
increase, and up to 38% penetration can be accommodated with some frequency stability concerns that 
possible to mitigate with more costly dispatch (DNV, 2018).
TNB already aims for a more flexible and enhanced grid for Peninsular Malaysia that should allow for the grid 
integration of renewables and enable the charging of electric vehicles. Grid modernisation with smart meters 
and a system to optimise voltage flows will be essential to support a smarter, more efficient and more resilient 
grid, such as the one being planned in Sarawak (Sarawak Energy, 2020). The approved share of the capital 
investments between 2018 and 2021 that dealt with energy transition was equivalent to 12.3%. In the proposed 
investment plan to 2024, this share was higher at 19.3%. Sarawak is embarking on the implementation of 
50 MW floating solar project at Batang Ai reservoir. The farm will be the first floating solar project under 
Independence Power Producer (IPP) in Sarawak. 
The Energy Commission’s Report on Peninsular Malaysia Generation Development Plan 2019 (2020-2030) 
provides an overview of the transmission grid planning in Peninsular Malaysia. Between 2015 and 2019, 
demand grew at an annual rate of 2.5%, rising from 16 822 MW to 18 566 MW (ST, 2020c). For the 2020-2030 
period, demand growth is projected at 1.8% annually. As demand is expected to be supplied increasingly from 
renewable power, net demand (the demand that is left over after that supplied by wind and solar power) is 
projected to grow 0.7% annually, which is a crucial indicator for transmission grid planning. 
According to the planning document, to achieve the target of 20% renewables in the energy mix by 2025, 
3 758 MW of new renewable energy capacity needs to be developed in Peninsular Malaysia starting by 2020. 
Of this total 2 172 MW is solar PV and 1 586 MW is other renewables. The 20% renewable capacity target would 
maintain system stability with solar penetration limited to 24% of the peak demand. Post-2025, the renewable 
capacity mix is planned to be maintained at 20%. Here, the projected capacity mix for Peninsular Malaysia 
increases from 9% to 23%, while the share of thermal (gas and coal) generating capacity decreases from 82% 
to 70%. To meet the demand growth and the additional supply capacity, the projected annual system cost 
for the Generation Development Plan (2020-2030) ranges from USD 8.4 billion (MYR 35.2 billion) in 2020 to 
USD 10.8 billion (MYR 45.4 billion) in 2030 (ST, 2020c).
In the newly released Peninsular Malaysia generation development plan to 2039, the penetration limit for 
grid-connected solar PV is set at 24% of the estimated peak demand by 2025. The penetration limit is derived 
from the common convention for solar threshold computation, which calculates the total grid-connected solar 
capacity (at both the distribution and transmission networks) relative to the annual forecasted peak demandmuch-needed technical enablers such as energy storage systems. Solar penetration is expected to reach 30% 
of the projected peak demand in 2035. To address system stability concerns due to the influx of renewable 
energy, five units of a battery energy storage system with a capacity of 100 MW were planned for installation 
annually into the system from 2030 to 2034 (ST, 2021b).
The Grid Code and Distribution Code were launched and published by the ST in December 2010. These codes 
are regulatory instruments for co-ordinating the various electricity supply activities of the electricity supplier, 
grid operators, distributors and consumers (TNB, 2022e). The Grid Code is a set of technical regulations used 
by utility companies such as TNB and the IPPs, and it serves as the main guideline for reliable electricity supply 
operations (Figure 23). The Distribution Code is a set of technical regulations established to ensure systematic 
distribution operations. The codes set the regulations and technical requirements for all parties involved in 
planning, managing and maintaining the grid and distribution systems.
The Grid Code and Distribution Code are regulatory instruments for co-ordinating the various electricity 
supply activities of the electricity supplier, grid operators, distributors and consumers.

3.5 INVESTMENT AND FINANCING
A number of fiscal incentives are in place for renewable energy project developers. In addition to the feedin tariff, the Large Scale Solar mechanism, and net metering, the other three key financial enablers are the 
Green Investment Tax Allowance (GITA), the Green Income Tax Exemption (GITE) and the Green Technology 
Financing Schemes (GTFS).

Distributionapproved. A performance assessment of the GTFS between 2010 and 2017 found that, in total, 28 financial 
institutions provided support to 319 projects during this period, with more than 90% of the beneficiaries 
being small and medium enterprises. This resulted in USD 1.6 billion (MYR 7.05 billion) in green investments, 
including in renewable energy projects that generate a combined 532.9 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity 
annually. Of the total finance, 53% came from conventional financing and 47% from Islamic financing. 
In March 2019, the Ministry of Finance approved an upgraded scheme, GTFS 2.0, for companies that are 
majority Malaysian-owned, allocating USD 0.47 billion (MYR 2 billion) for the period between January 2019 
and the end of 2020 (Koo Boo Hin and Chiah, 2022). This step offered a 2% annual interest subsidy for the first 
seven years, with the government providing a 60% capital guarantee on the financing. 
The GTFS 2.0 performance assessment showed that by the end of 2019, a total of 35 projects had been 
certified at a combined cost of USD 0.37 billion (MYR 1.6 billion), with 25 of the projects receiving bank loan 
approvals totalling USD 0.2 billion (MYR 0.9 billion). Around half of the projects are solar (mainly utility scale). 
The impact is expected to reach USD 0.3 billion (MYR 1.33 billion) in green investments (APEC, 2020). 
In addition to the Green Investment Tax Allowance (GITA) and the Green Income Tax Exemption (GITE), 
further tax incentives have provided support for green financing (APEC, 2020). These include a tax deduction 
until the assessment year 2020 on issuance costs of socially responsible investing (SRI) sukuk either approved 
or authorised or lodged with the Securities Commission; the USD 1.43 million (MYR 6 million) Green SRI 
Sukuk Grant Scheme to defray independent expert review costs incurred by issuers; and a tax exemption for 
recipients under the Green SRI Sukuk Grant Scheme for the assessment years 2018 to 2020.
According to International Energy Agency analysis, investment risks are low with regard to the financial 
health of the system, financing and capital costs, and integrated approaches; however, there are potential 
risks concerning the bankability of projects. According to the Energy Commission, to reach a 50% renewable 
share in electricity generation, Malaysia would require a total investment of around USD 6-11 billion. Solar PV 
would play a crucial role in this. Although debt capital market instruments are available to large renewable 
energy developers through debt, equity or mezzanine financing, additional personal and business loans may 
be required to help companies and consumers manage the cost of installing solar panels in offices and homes 
(Ng, 2020). Malaysia’s financial markets comprise nearly 90% bank loans, followed by around 7% bonds and 
3% equity (Peimani, 2018).
Islamic finance is considered one of the new options for solar financing outside of the conventional loans, 
bonds and equity schemes. One popular finance technique is “green sukuk”, a Shariah-compliant green bond 
mechanism that recently was used to finance five renewable energy projects in Malaysia. In July 2017, Tadau 
Energy Sdn Bhd issued the first green sukuk in the world, raising USD 59 million (MYR 250 million) to finance 
a 50 MW solar PV plant in Sabah. Following this demonstration, a larger-scale project (MYR 1 billion) was 
issued (World Bank, 2018). In January 2018, Sinar Kamiri Sdn Bhd, an indirect subsidiary of Mudajaya Group 
Berhad, issued a green sukuk of USD 60 million (MYR 245 million) to finance the construction/development of 
a 49 MW solar PV plant in Sungai Siput, Perak (DME and ISRA, 2019). In April 2018, UiTM Solar Power Sdn Bhd, 
an indirect subsidiary of Universiti Teknologi Mara, issued a green sukuk of USD 60 million (MYR 240 million) 
to finance the development and operation of the 50 MW utility-scale solar PV plant in Gambang, Pahang. It 
was the first institute of higher learning in the world to issue a Green SRI Sukuk (DME and ISRA, 2019).
The Malaysian Government Credit Guarantee Corporation provides financing for the preparation/early-stage, 
financing and implementation stages of projects. Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Berhad High Technology Fund 
provides financing for the preparation/early-stage and financing stages of projects.4.1 METHODOLOGY AND KEY ASSUMPTIONS 
The World Energy Transitions Outlook, released by IRENA in 2021, shows that a drastic reduction in greenhouse 
gas emissions is needed in order to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping the rise in global temperature 
well below 2 degrees Celsius (°C). Key to this emission reduction over the coming decades will be increased 
investments in the energy transition, including greater deployment of renewable energy and changes in the 
energy infrastructure.  
IRENA’s renewable energy roadmaps programme, REmap, provides strategies for energy transition at the 
country and regional levels, with perspectives for 2030 and 2050. The aim of developing regional studies is 
to understand how a region can promote an energy transition pathway – respecting countries’ unique energy 
resources, socio-economic status, as well as institutional and regulatory endowments – while at the same time 
contributing to the global emission reduction objective and leveraging opportunities to meet regional energy 
and investment goals. For ASEAN, REmap identified a pathway for the region to achieve its renewable energy 
target of 23% in the energy mix by 2025. 
REmap takes a bottom-up approach. The analysis uses an internally developed REmap tool that incorporates 
detailed energy demand and supply data by sector, a substitution analysis on technology options for 
renewables, and an assessment of associated costs, investments and benefits. The analytical process is 
carried out by IRENA teams in close collaboration with in-country energy experts through a series of multistakeholder consultative workshops and expert meetings.  For the REmap analytical study conducted for 
Malaysia, a wide range of stakeholders were consulted with coordination from the energy ministry (then 
known as KETSA, now NRECC) throughout 2020 to 2022. These included the energy regulator (Energy 
Commission), state utilities (Tenaga Nasional Berhad, Sarawak Energy Berhad, and Sabah Electricity Sdn 
Bhd), the Ministry of Transport (MOT), and other stakeholders (Single Buyer, Grid System Operator, and 
Malaysian Green Technology And Climate Change Corporation)
A detailed engagement process for the development of this report is elaborated in Chapter 1.
Methodology
The IRENA REmap-FlexTool approach for the design and elaboration of the Malaysia Energy Transition Outlook
aimed to create technical pathways focusing on multiple scenarios. A bottom-up analysis was carried out for 
details on the energy demand by end-use sector, which included a substitution analysis on technology options 
for renewables and an assessment of associated costs, investments and benefits in close collaboration with 
country energy experts through a series of multi-stakeholder consultative workshops and expert meetings. 
The power sector was modelled using PLEXOS for capacity expansion, and a flexibility assessment was 
performed using IRENA’s FlexTool product.
The description of each REmap scenario is described in Figure 24
ENERGY TRANSITION 4 OUTLOOKFigure 24 Description of REmap scenarios
The energy assessment was then complemented with an analysis of the costs, investment and benefits (avoided 
negative externalities) of the various scenarios. The analysis provides an estimate of the overall costs involved 
in implementing each of the scenarios. This includes investment in equipment and new installations, fuel costs, 
operation and maintenance costs, and externalities. It allows for a first assessment of the total costs and benefits 
necessary to achieve investments in the energy transition and decarbonisation scenarios for the region.  
Box 4 REmap Toolkit
The REmap Toolkit is a software application that enables the development of full energy balances covering the 
whole energy system, including energy demand, energy transformation and losses, and primary energy supply. 
The Toolkit is based on modules that can be used depending on the specific requirements and data availability 
of each project. 
The Toolkit is a parametric model where future energy demand and supply are fully assessed based on input 
parameters, such as activity levels, energy service penetration, technology shares and fuel mixes. It is a bottom-up 
approach. These are all exogenous inputs to the model, and energy demand is fully determined from those inputs 
through deterministic model equations. The toolkit does not rely on cost-optimisation nor multi-criteria methods. 
Base Energy Scenario
(BES)
The BES for the power sector assessment 
reflects a more static view on capacity 
expansion, maintaining a historical trend into 
the long term. It assumes that current or 
planned polices are not adhered to or rolled 
back. This scenario is similar to a 
"business-as-usual" scenario. BES in the 
demand sector reflects the existing 
projection developed based on the Second 
Biennial Update Report (BAU).
Planned Energy Scenario
(PES)
 The PES reflects current plans and other 
expected objectives or policies that were 
approved as of the time of conducting the 
analysis. The PES is the primary Reference 
Case for this study, and it is off this 
scenario that the energy transition 
scenarios are developed.
Transforming Energy Scenario
(TES)
 The TES describes an energy pathway 
based largely on currently available and 
competitive low and zero carbon 
technologies. It is characterised largely 
by renewable energy expansion and 
energy efficiency.
1.5°C Scenario 
(1.5-S)
 The 1.5-S is a more ambitious energy 
pathway, and outlines options to further 
reduce CO2
 emissions in the energy system 
in challenging sectors. It is informed by the 
WETO scenario aiming to reach net zero 
emissions globally by 2050. For the 
power sector two cases were analysed: 
one with 90% renewable electricity 
generation (RE90) and one with 100% 
renewable electricity generation (RE100).

and planned polices?

and costs for the transition?Box 4 REmap Toolkit (continued)
The IRENA FlexTool, developed with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, performs power system 
flexibility assessments based on national capacity investment plans and forecasts. The tool assessments reflect 
full power system dispatch and offer a detailed view of flexible generation options, demand flexibility, and 
energy storage, along with sector coupling technologies such as power-to-heat, electric vehicles and hydrogen 
production through electrolysis.
Figure 25 shows the interaction of different tools to perform energy analysis of the end-use and power sectors, 
as well as estimations of investments and CO2 emissions for the study. 
The analysis uses a number of toolkits to develop the scenarios.

Energy statistics were obtained from the Energy Commission of Malaysia (ST), with the 2018 national energy 
balance used as the primary reference and base year. 
Further breakdowns of energy consumption by sector (transport, industry and buildings) into sub-sectors 
and end uses were obtained from other studies and datasets. For buildings, Household Expenditure Surveys 
from the Department of Statistics Malaysia were used together with statistics for the commercial sector 
from the National Property Information Centre (NAPIC). Transport data, especially vehicle stock, sales and 
activity-level data, were gathered from the Ministry of Transport, Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalan (JPJ) and from 
the Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research (MIROS). The Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint 2021-2030 was 
referenced for national plans in the transport sector. Industrial energy data were obtained mainly from surveys 
conducted by the Energy Commission as well as from company and industry reports in the petrochemical, 
manufacturing, iron and steel, and cement sectors to estimate growth projections and production outputs.

(TNB, SEB, SESB) in 2021 and 2022. National plans such as the Report on Peninsular Malaysia Generation 
Development Plans (2021-2039) and the Malaysia Renewable Energy Roadmap were also consulted. 
For climate targets, Malaysia’s submitted and revised National Determined Contribution document in 2021 was 
used as the primary reference, with actual and projected emissions data supplemented by the Second Biennial 
Update Report submission (in 2018) to the UNFCCC. While carbon neutrality targets were announced in late 
2021, as of the time of this writing emission projection pathways covering the whole energy sector were not 
available. In late 2022, it was announced that a new agency, the National Energy Council, will be established 
to steer agendas and strategies set under the National Energy Policy (2022-2040), including a mandate to 
enhance nationwide emissions reporting. In addition to this, Malaysia is currently also preparing its own Longterm Low Emissions and Development Strategies (LT-LEDS), as referenced in the aforementioned document 
(EPU, 2022).
Key assumptions 
The population of Malaysia is expected to grow from around 32 million people in 2018 to around 
40.7 million people by 2050. While the population growth rate has been higher in the past (1.4% on average 
during 2010-2020), a slower growth rate is expected in the next three decades (0.8%) due to a decrease in net 
migration and a slowing birth rate in the country (DOSM, 2016; United Nations, 2020).
The GDP of Malaysia grew at a modest average rate of 4.5% annually between 2010 and 2018, reaching 
USD 349 billion (in constant 2015 dollars) in 2018. The GDP dropped 5.6% in 2020, during the first year of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, but then quickly rebounded to 3.1% growth in 2021 (BNM, 2022b). Future growth is 
expected to occur mainly in the manufacturing sector, with total GDP increasing 3.1% annually on average to 
reach USD 934 billion by 2050.

Summary of findings
KEY MESSAGES
Malaysia’s final energy consumption will double by 2050 in the Planned Energy 
Scenario (PES), where energy demand is expected to increase 2.0% annually on 
average.
In the two energy transition scenarios – characterised by increased energy 
efficiency, fuel switching to renewables and electrification of transport – average 
annual growth in energy demand will be slower, at 1.5% in the Transforming Energy 
Scenario (TES) and 1.2% in the 1.5°C Scenario (1.5-S). 
Solar PV will play a key role in the energy transition, with its total capacity reaching 
83 GW in the TES and 153 GW in the 1.5-S by 2050; renewable energy will contribute 
89% or more of total electricity generation, up from 16% today. 
Renewable direct-use is also important, with 20% of final energy consumption 
coming from these sources by 2050. The production of clean hydrogen and 
its derivative fuels must ramp up from negligible levels in 2020 to at least 
1.5 million tonnes by 2050.
In the PES, CO2 emissions from the energy sector are expected to increase to 268 
million tonnes by 2030, owing to a substantial increase in energy needs for power 
generation. The 1.5-S energy scenario will lead to a 60% reduction in emissions in 
2050 compared to the PES. Additional efforts in CO2 removal will be needed to close 
the gap for Malaysia to reach its carbon neutrality target by 2050.
Malaysia is expected to see sustained growth in its energy demand over the coming decades, as it continues 
to be one of the largest economies in Southeast Asia. The total primary energy supply increases more than 
three-fold over the period to 2050. The large differences seen among the scenarios are elaborated on later 
in this chapter.the scenario.

by 2030, from 152 TWh in 2018 to 200 TWh, after which it will increase 2.1% annually to reach 300 TWh by 
2050. However, fossil fuels will still comprise 68% of total final energy consumption, or 77% of total final 
consumption, by 2050 in the PES, where they will remain crucial for the transport and industry sectors, 
including for non-energy uses. Sectoral summaries are elaborated in the following sections.
In the 1.5-S – with renewables, aggressive energy efficiency measures and electrification across all sectors – 
the final energy consumption will grow at an annual average rate of 1.2% to reach 3.1 EJ, with a total reduction 
of 23% compared to the PES. A larger trend of electrification (29% share) is also present, as well as a higher 
biomass share (20%) used in the industry and transport sectors, in the form of biofuels. Hydrogen will also 
begin to play a nominal role in Malaysia, where it will comprise up to 5% (4.3 EJ) of the total final energy 
consumption by 2050 in the 1.5-S.
Malaysia’s total final energy consumption nearly doubles by 2050 in the PES, dominated by fossil fuels, 
whereas a transition in the 1.5-S reduces that demand by 23%.

Total primary energy supply
As of 2018, Malaysia’s primary energy supply was around 4.1 EJ, with the share of renewables at only 3%. If all 
of the measures and actions are undertaken for the two energy transition scenarios, the share of renewables 
can reach up to 26% in the TES and 40% in the 1.5-S by 2050. This represents a savings in energy use of 
between 18% and 21% compared to the PES in 2050.

Energy-related emissions
IRENA’s analysis covers only energy sector emissions, using emission factors for energy combustion from 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Based on this analysis, energy sector emissions in 
2018 are calculated to be 220 million tonnes of CO2.
4 The power sector accounted for the highest share of 
emissions, at 47%, followed by the transport sector at 33%. 
In the PES, emissions are expected to rise to 280 million tonnes of CO2 by 2050. While there will be reductions 
from the power sector as renewable electricity generation increases (particularly from solar PV), emissions 
from the transport and industry sectors will continue to rise.

by 30% in the TES and 58% in the 1.5-S, compared to the PES. The largest emission reductions will be in the 
power sector, a trend seen almost immediately after 2030 due to increased use of carbon capture technology, 
solar PV and battery storage to curb the use of fossil fuel power plants.
Although the transport and industry sectors would contribute the bulk of the remaining emissions in the 1.5-S 
in 2050, emission reductions can also be achieved in the transport sector due to the massive push towards 
electric vehicles and modal shift. The remaining emissions that come from the remaining internal combustion 
engine vehicles, mainly large trucks, and the use of fossil fuels in the industrial sector for energy-intensive 
processes.
Malaysia’s energy sector-related CO2 emissions are expected to rise to 280 MtCo2 by 2050. IRENA’s 1.5-S 
will see Malaysia’s emission reducing by around 60%.

Box 5 Benchmarking IRENA analysis with net zero pledges and commitments 
until 2050
Malaysia’s greenhouse gas emissions were last reported in 2020, calculated for the year 2016. After accounting 
for offsets from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), the country’s net greenhouse gas emissions 
totalled 76 million tonnes of CO2. Energy-related emissions totalled around 251 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent 
in 2016, with the power sector representing 39% of these emissions (GoM, 2020b). 
At the 26th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 26) in 2021, Malaysia pledged to achieve carbon 
neutrality by 2050. As of the time of this writing, no official long-term energy planning policy document or 
pathways had yet been released; however, the development of a Long-Term Low Emission Development 
Strategy (LT-LEDS) is under way (Yun, 2022). Box 5 Benchmarking IRENA analysis with net zero pledges and commitments 
until 2050 (continued)
Malaysia’s Nationally Determined Contribution towards reducing emissions under the Paris Agreement sets 
an unconditional target for a 45% reduction in the country’s greenhouse gas emission intensity (tonnes of 
CO2 emissions per unit of GDP) by 2030 (compared to the 2005 level) (GoM, 2020a). However, it does not 
elaborate specific and quantifiable energy sector emission targets. 
The National Energy Policy 2022-2040, published in September 2022, outlines the strategy and action plans 
to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by as early as 2050, including by prioritising economic resilience 
and security and environmental sustainability, and achieving social equitability and affordability (EPU, 2022). As 
part of the strategy, a new National Energy Council is planned to steer the policy’s strategies and action plans, 
involving multiple stakeholders. Part of its mandate will be to improve the current national greenhouse gas 
emission accounting and reporting as well as the carbon footprint, also from the private sector.
Benchmarking IRENA’s emission projection values with the upcoming LT-LEDS and other national policies and 
strategies will be beneficial in painting a holistic picture of Malaysia’s envisioned energy transition pathways 
for reaching net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. IRENA’s 1.5-S aims for Malaysia to reduce its energy sector 
emissions (including in the power, transport and industry sectors) to almost 120 million tonnes of CO2 by 2050, 
a reduction of 58% compared to the current pathway. Combined with other carbon offsetting measures, such as 
in LULUCF, a net zero emission target by 2050 for Malaysia is achievable. 
Emission projections show a wide range of possible outcomes.

Electricity will continue to dominate energy consumption in the buildings sector, 
with space cooling becoming the main driver of electricity demand growth. 
Energy demand in the sector is expected to grow around 2.0% annually on average 
until 2050.
With stringent energy efficiency measures and standards in both the residential 
and commercial sectors, energy demand growth can slow to 1.6% in the TES and 
1.2% in the 1.5-S. 
Electricity dominates energy use in the buildings sector, with space cooling and appliances accounting for

Energy use in the buildings sector in Malaysia relies primarily on electricity as a main carrier. The residential 
sector accounts for almost half of the energy consumption (43%) in the buildings sector. Based on national 
surveys, there was a rapid increase in household equipment ownership from 2010 onwards, and by 2019 
almost all households owned basic electrical appliances (DOSM, 2020a). This includes rising ownership of air 
conditioning units, with 54% of all households owning at least one air conditioner in 2019 compared to 22% a 
decade prior.updated to ensure that a minimum level of energy-efficient appliances are sold in the market (ST, 2022d). 
Meanwhile, the country has achieved 100% clean cooking penetration, with LPG as a main carrier (above 95%), 
driven by the presence of oil and gas industries since the 1980s.

In the PES, electricity consumption in the country is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 2.4% 
until 2030. Afterwards, this growth is expected to drop to 2.1% until 2050 with the expected slowing of 
population growth, market saturation and slowdown in the build rate of buildings. LPG will remain the main 
fuel of choice for cooking, with an increased use of electric stoves in urban dwellings. As a result, energy 
consumption in the buildings sector will reach 420 PJ in 2030 and 617 PJ by 2050.sector, reducing energy consumption by 14% in the TES and 22% in the 1.5-S compared to the PES (Figure 31). 
Under both scenarios, only highly energy-efficient equipment can continue to be sold in the market. Because 
future demand will be driven by space cooling needs, energy efficiency measures will be implemented so 
that the overall building energy intensity is in the range of 150 kWh to 200 kWh/m2, mainly through energy 
conservation, energy-efficient equipment and low-carbon architecture. Electric stoves should be continually 
promoted to replace LPG, with usage in up to 90% of households by 2050. Solar water heaters can also be a 
key technology to reduce electricity use.
Energy use in the buildings sector will double by 2050 in the PES, while energy transition measures in the 
1.5-S will reduce the sector’s consumption by 22%.

Box 6 Managing energy efficiency in the residential and commercial sectors
With its emerging economy and rapid urbanisation, Malaysia’s buildings are highly reliant on electricity to meet 
the energy needs of both households and the commercial sector. Additionally, space cooling needs are expected 
to drive the future growth in electricity use, with average annual demand growth of between 1.8% and 2.9% in 
all IRENA scenarios. Therefore, energy efficiency practices and measures, passive cooling design approaches 
and other incentives are crucial to reduce electricity demand in the sector.
Through better demand-side management and energy efficiency measures and practices, energy consumption 
in Malaysia’s buildings can be reduced by more than 20% in the 1.5-S compared to the PES in 2050, as shown in 
Figure 31 for both the residential and the commercial sectors.Box 6 Managing energy efficiency in the residential and commercial sectors

The implementation of efficiency labelling ratings, phase-out of inefficient technologies, and promotion of 
awareness campaigns and cash rebates should be continued to further encourage the use of energy-efficient 
appliances and reduce electricity consumption (SEDA, 2022). Additionally, expanding the current Green 
Building Index initiative and energy efficiency targets beyond public buildings to include commercial and 
private buildings can help track, benchmark and accelerate the adoption of energy efficiency measures, taking 
advantage of environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments from the private sector.

KEY MESSAGES
Malaysia’s vehicle stock is projected to double by 2050 from 29 million vehicles 
today, the majority of which are motorcycles and cars. Without intervening 
policy measures to encourage and integrate other modes of transport while also 
transitioning to more energy-efficient vehicles, oil demand in road transport is 
expected to almost triple by 2050 in the PES. 
Electrification is the most viable transition pathway to decarbonising the 
transport sector. In the 1.5-S, a projected 76% of all road vehicles will run on 
electricity by 2050. One-third of annual sales of cars and motorcycles need to be 
electric vehicles from 2030 onwards, and more than 60% from 2040 onwards. To 
support 38 million electric vehicles by 2050, 1.3 million public charging stations need 
to be installed in the country.
Biofuels will play an important role in decarbonising the hard-to-electrify road 
freight sector and will play a growing role in aviation. Total demand for liquid 
biofuels will grow more than 20-fold despite massive electrification in the transport 
sector 
Road transport consumed 87% of the total transport energy consumption in Malaysia in 2018 (Figure 33). Oil 
dominates in this energy consumption (98%), consisting of petrol, diesel and kerosene.
Road transport dominates energy use in Malaysia’s transport sector, with petrol accounting for more than 
half of the sector’s energy consumption.

In the PES, transport energy consumption is expected to increase almost three-fold, from 989 PJ in 2018 
to 1 787 PJ by 2050. A large share (86%) of the energy consumption in 2050 will remain oil-based, while 
electricity demand will have only a 3% share (13.1 TWh). Electric vehicle sales are expected to pick up in the 
near term, to reach up to 200 000 electric cars and 2.8 million electric motorcycles by 2030, as proposed in 
the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint (KASA, 2021).6 Sales are then expected to accelerate after 2030, reaching 
3.9 million electric cars and 6.4 million electric motorcycles by 2050. For biofuels, the B30 blending mandate 
is implemented from 2030 and maintained until 2050 to reach 5.3 billion litres of annual biodiesel production, 
up almost 10-fold from today. Based on national plans, near-term efforts are made to increase energy-efficient 
vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles, since there is already an automotive industrial production base in 
the country. 
In the TES and 1.5-S, electrification of vehicles is key to reducing emissions, with reductions of up to 40% in 
the 1.5-S compared to the PES by 2050. In the TES, up to 50% of all vehicles on the road will be electric, while 
in the 1.5-S the share is 75% (Figure 34). The 1.5-S foresees up to 20 million electric cars and 17 million electric 
motorcycles by 2050, with annual electric vehicle sales of more than 0.8 million annually from 2030 onwards. 
The bulk of electric vehicles will be passenger vehicles – motorcycles and cars – while freight trucks will still 
have to rely on fossil fuels and biofuels to travel long distances.

Box 7 Transitioning to electric vehicles in Malaysia
The road ahead for the future of transport leads towards electro-mobility, as evidenced by the rise of electric 
vehicles, particularly in China, Europe, and the United States, gaining a 10% global market sales share in 2021 
(IEA, 2022a). IRENA projects that in the ASEAN region alone, 108 million cars and 299 million motorcycles will 
run on electricity by 2050 under the 1.5-S (IRENA, 2022b). Malaysia’s Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint 2021-2030 
envisions a 15% share of electric motorcycles and 20 000 electric cars by 2030.
Managing the supply chain and critical materials is becoming a key topic in the transition towards electric 
vehicles, particularly in the production of batteries. Malaysia accounts for 11% of the global processing capacity 
for rare earth elements, which are integral in clean energy applications and automotive manufacturing 
(IRENA, 2022a). While the country may not possess other critical materials required for the energy transition, 
considerations must be made towards negotiating supply agreements and prices – ensuring that there are valueadded contributions and that technological expertise is developed to contribute to advancing the economy 
before transforming the automotive industry. 
Samsung Electronics’ battery arm, Samsung SDI, estimates that the demand for batteries for manufacturing 
electrical tools and energy storage systems as well as electric vehicles will increase to 15 billion cells of cylindrical 
batteries in 2027. The company has broken ground on a USD 1.3 billion factory in Malaysia to take advantage of 
the country’s solid yet inexpensive tech climate during this period of growth in the global electric vehicle battery 
market (Jennings, 2022). 
The Chinese battery manufacturer Eve Energy, through its subsidiary EVE Energy Malaysia, is investing up 
to USD 422 million to set up a battery plant to supply consumers in Malaysia and other Southeast Asian 
countries, mainly for electric bikes and power tools. The plant is forecasted to be operational within three 
years (Chan, 2022). In another promising investment, Malaysia-based investment firm Hong Seng and US-based 
battery anode firm EoCell are partnering to manufacture electric vehicle batteries and eventually energy storage 
solutions to supply manufacturers, assemblers and users in Southeast Asia (Crompton, 2022). 
As part of the energy transition towards electric vehicles, policies such as end-of-life vehicle schemes are 
necessary to ensure that older and inefficient vehicles are phased out, while also supporting measures to shift 
to other means of transport or towards newer and efficient vehicles. Additionally, with decades of experience in 
the automotive manufacturing, Malaysia is well positioned to manufacture its own competitive electric vehicles. 
Therefore, a clear direction and policy, apart from shifting away from subsidies in transport fuels, needs to be 
given to signal the private sector and buyers to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles2030; this would mean increasing the production capacity 20-fold from today’s level. The 1.5-S also envisions 
the adoption of up to 5% advanced biofuels in aviation by 2050, in line with international aspirations to 
decarbonise the sector. To date, several airlines in Malaysia and surrounding regions have tested such fuels. A 
forthcoming IRENA report in 2024 will focus on analysing the potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) 
production in the Southeast Asia region
For all scenarios, with new rail lines currently under construction for both passenger and freight use, electricity 
demand will grow 6% annually on average until 2030 and 11% annually on average until 2050 as more freight 
volume is transported via rail. However, energy consumption will remain less than 2% of the total transport 
consumption in the 1.5-S. Meanwhile, energy demand from the aviation sector is expected to grow 2.8% 
annually on average based on fuel demand and domestic passenger growth in Malaysia. 
Malaysia’s transport sector transformation will see the sector’s energy demand reduced by 16% and 30% 
in the TES and the 1.5-S, respectively. Share of oil consumption will decrease from accounting for 97% in 
2018, to about only three-quarter in TES 2050, and even plunges to only about little over a half of sector’s 
consumption in 1.5-S 2050.
Transport sector energy use is projected to grow 1.9% annually, nearly doubling by 2050 in the PES. The 
energy transition measures reduce the sector’s energy consumption by 30% in the 1.5-S.

Rail RoadBox 8 Decarbonising urban transport – avoid, shift and improve policies
Electric vehicles are still in their infancy in Malaysia, with just over 300 in the country as of 2020. At the same 
time, the already high motorisation rate in Malaysia compared to the rest of Southeast Asia means that a 
majority of the population relies on private vehicles for transport. In the urban area of Klang Valley, enveloping 
the capital of Kuala Lumpur, less than 17% of journeys are undertaken using public transport (Chuen, Karim and 
Yusoff, 2014). While switching to electric vehicles might lead to long-term emission reductions in the country, 
this must be coupled with a long-term goal to promote sustainable and public transport. The latest National 
Energy Plan targets a 50% share of urban public transport by 2040 (EPU, 2022).
Urban transport policies can be categorised by how they seek to decarbonise the transport sector: that 
is, do they seek to avoid, shift, or improve usage of various transport modes (SLOCAT, 2021). In all three 
categories, decarbonisation can result from, or even contribute to, increased use of renewable energy. The 
avoid-shift-improve policy baskets offer different levels of effectiveness in curbing carbon and other forms of 
air pollution, with avoid strategies offering the greatest cuts and improve strategies the least (IRENA, 2021c). 
IRENA’s analysis in this report covers the impacts of the improve policy basket on emissions, mainly achieving 
better fuel economy, electric mobility and alternative fuels. Avoid policies require some of the greatest systemlevel changes – such as redesigning land use for greater density – and therefore could take the longest and be 
the most politically difficult to implement. What is clear from IRENA’s analysis in the transport sector is that 
further investment in public transport such as increasing the number of buses and rail is required across Malaysia 
to shift away from high private vehicle use as well as curbing fuel subsidies in transport.

KEY MESSAGES
Industry sector energy demand will grow 2.1% annually on average in the PES, 
with the increase in demand driven mainly by economic growth and increased 
investment in different manufacturing sectors and in iron and steel. With energy 
transition measures such as fuel substitution, low-carbon technologies, and energy 
efficiency improvement, energy demand grows more slowly at 1.7% in the TES and 
1.6% in the 1.5-S.
Biomass and hydrogen will play important roles in decarbonising the industry 
sector. In both scenarios, biomass use needs to grow substantially to substitute the 
use of natural gas in heat-intensive processes, while hydrogen production can cater 
to global demand for green hydrogen in the non-energy sector. 
In the energy transition scenarios, green hydrogen and its derivatives will be 
a key fuel for decarbonisation. Malaysia is strategically located to use its natural 
resources and leverage its experience to meet global demand for green hydrogen. 
Industry sector emissions in the 1.5-S will grow in the short term, then decline and 
reach the same level as today in 2050. As one of the hard-to-decarbonise sectors, 
industry will continue to rely on some fossil fuel use during the time horizon until 
2050, with carbon capture and storage becoming a potential option to tackle the 
remaining emissions.
In 2018, the industry sector consumed almost 30% of the final energy consumption in Malaysia. The sector’s 
major energy consumers – iron and steel, cement and chemicals – are modelled into the analysis. Natural gas 
supplied around 43% of industrial energy consumption in 2018, while electricity (34%) is employed mainly for 
the manufacturing and semi-conductor industry, the country’s largest industry sector. Although biomass data 
are lacking in the national energy statistics for industry, several industry sub-sectors (mainly major cement 
and petrochemical companies) note the use of waste and agricultural residues in their processes as an energysaving measure in their company annual reports.
In the PES, overall energy demand in the industrial sector is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 
2.1%, from 797 PJ in 2018 to 1 564 PJ by 2050. This is based on the projected GDP growth rate in the sector 
and on the improved energy efficiency. Natural gas will still supply most of the energy consumption, followed 
by electricity. If the analysis also includes the non-energy sector, where natural gas is the main feedstock for 
the petrochemical sector, overall demand in the industrial sector is expected to grow from 1 352 PJ in 2018 to 
2 819 PJ by 2050.
By sub-sector, iron and steel production is projected to grow 5% on average until 2030, reaching 
23 million tonnes of annual production capacity due to large investments in blast furnaces already committed 
early in the decade. Afterwards, it is expected to grow 3% annually until 2050 to reach 42 million tonnes production, is expected to follow a modest annual growth of 4.1% until 2030, followed by a lower demand 
growth of 3% between 2030 and 2050.
In the two energy transition scenarios, improved energy efficiency measures and technology processes across 
all sub-sectors will lead to reductions in energy consumption of 11% in the TES and 16% in the 1.5-S by 2050, 
compared to the PES. Overall energy intensity will improve 0.7% annually in the TES and 1.0% annually in the 
1.5-S, compared to 0.5% annually in the PES. Significant emission reduction can be achieved by fuel switching 
from natural gas and coal to biomass and waste products in the 1.5-S, although emissions from the industry 
sector will still represent 35% of the overall energy-related emissions in the 1.5-S in 2050. 
Hydrogen is expected to also play a role in decarbonising the sector, where it can substitute natural gas in 
energy-intensive processes such as iron and steel, as well as serve as a feedstock for production of ammonia 
and methanol, where both fuels is expected to play a key role in decarbonizing the maritime sector. In this 
case, hydrogen consumption in the 1.5-S is expected to reach 200 PJ (around 2 600 tonnes) by 2050. Key 
actions in the industry sub-sectors are shown Figure 38.

Successful transformation of industry while maintaining competitiveness will require consideration of the

• Encourage the recycling of scrap metal from 0.5 MTPA in 2018 
to 7.0 MTPA production capacity by 2050 in 1.5-S.

and methanol with hydrogen.
Box 9 Carbon capture and storage for hard-to-decarbonise sectors
In the 1.5-S, industrial emissions will still account for 25% of total energy emissions by 2050. Cutting out fossil 
fuels entirely is challenging, especially given the need to drive economic growth and national priorities related to 
the energy transition. While emissions can be offset using Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), 
carbon sequestration units could help capture process emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as 
cement, iron and steel. Pilot projects could be deployed with the use of carbon capture and storage to gradually 
become commercially available in the future.
As of early 2021, 24 commercial fossil-fuel-based CCS facilities were in operation globally, with an installed 
capacity able to capture around 0.04 gigatonnes (Gt) per year of energy- and process-related CO2 emissions 
(IRENA, 2022b). Malaysia will need to learn from the successes and failures of CCS projects around the world. 
Planning resources adequately and enhancing institutional skills are crucial steps in the process, as well as coordination to avoid bottlenecks along the value chain. 
A legal and regulatory framework for storage facilities must be in place before planning a CCS facility. Overall 
project execution for CCS usually takes up to four to five years with several steps, such as pre-feasibility and 
feasibility studies (one to two years), licensing approvals (e.g. technical and environmental) and construction 
(three to four years). An example is the Greensand project in Denmark, which consists of three phases: appraisal, 
pilot (proof of concept) and full project execution. The appraisal phase took place in 2021, and the CCS facility 
is expected to be fully operational by 2025 (Ineos, 2021).Global pipeline infrastructure to support long-term CCS deployment in the coming 30-40 years will need to 
be scaled up to 100 times from what is currently available (Global CCS Institute, 2020). A shared transport 
and storage network might improve the economics of CCS facilities by reducing operational costs through 
economies of scale while addressing cross-chain risks. 
Alternative options to CCS and to carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) include other CO2 removal 
technologies and measures. These include direct air capture, afforestation and reforestation, enhanced 
weathering and other measures. Whereas CCS and CCUS can be applied at the source of emissions, these other 
measures would need to be part of a larger carbon market allowing for carbon offsets and trading.
Fossil fuel consumption cannot be phased out entirely within the time horizon to 2050; CCS 
technology may be adopted to further decarbonise the sector.

Industry4.3 POWER SECTOR TRANSFORMATION AND FLEXIBILITY
KEY MESSAGES
Because electricity demand could double or more from today’s levels by 2050, 
how power generation capacity is expanded to meet this rising demand will be 
instrumental for national CO2 emissions. Unless renewables deployment keeps pace 
with and exceeds demand growth, power sector emissions could remain at today’s 
levels of 100 million tonnes per year out to 2050 despite significant renewables 
expansion.
The hydropower potential concentrated in Sabah and Sarawak has a key role in 
shaping the future regional power system. These regions are home to more than 
80% of the country’s hydropower potential, and high electricity demand is projected 
in neighbouring regions such as Kalimantan and those further afield such as Java 
in Indonesia. Transmitting power from generation sources to demand centres will 
require considerable expansion of national and international transmission capacity 
across the region.
Malaysia has a vast wealth of renewable energy resources, key among them being 
solar PV with an overall potential of around 337 GW. How and where these resources 
are developed will require integrated planning in distribution, transmission and 
generation capacity so that they can be effectively and meaningfully unlocked in a 
high-renewables pathway.
Overview and scope
To be consistent with a climate-compatible world, the electricity sector will have to be thoroughly decarbonised 
by mid-century across the ASEAN region. Accomplishing this will require accelerating the deployment in 
power generation of all forms of renewable energy technologies: wind (onshore and offshore), solar PV, 
hydropower, biomass and geothermal energy, among others. Wind and solar PV will lead the transformation, 
supplying up to 20% of total electricity generation by 2030 (from just over 1% today) in the ASEAN region.
Malaysia’s power sector is a key source of national emissions and spans a vast area that comprises three 
regions, Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. All regions have different populations, generation capacity 
mixes, local resources and electricity demands, which means that power system planning needs to account 
for all these differences when charting future national power system pathways and national and international 
integration of power systems.
Coal in recent years has represented a growing share of power generation in Malaysia and now represents 
around 40% of the total. The large share of coal-fired generation means that power sector emissions are 
mostly a result of coal’s dominance in the generation mix of Peninsular Malaysia and, to a lesser extent, 
Sarawak. However, with a lack of substantial domestic resources, the coal fleet is not anticipated to expand 
further in the coming years, with further natural gas and renewable expansion expected to come online. across the energy system, combined with increased levels of renewables penetration. However, measures 
designed to achieve such goals must also have at their heart security of supply, affordability and environmental 
considerations. Historically, the ASEAN region has over-projected electricity growth, which is an important 
consideration in the context of such ambitious levels of electrification. The power sector analyses in the 1.5-S 
did consider the impacts of lower potential electrification levels on capacity expansion, but the systems 
were largely of a similar composition; this indicates that attaining a lower level would not inhibit or alter the 
technology mix needed at an overall high level, just its overall magnitude.
Malaysia has significant resources of both fossil fuels and renewables, but the vast majority of its renewable 
energy potential remains to be developed. To date, the key renewables in the power sector have been 
hydropower (6 GW of installed capacity as of 2021) and solar PV (1.8 GW). The untapped hydropower 
potential is concentrated mainly in Sarawak and is distant from the key national load centres on Peninsular 
Malaysia, where much of the potential has already been developed. This implies that any significant reliance 
on hydropower nationally would need to be in conjunction with deep national power system integration. 
Although solar PV is well distributed as a resource in Malaysia, much of the country’s wind potential is far 
from demand centres and far offshore. Both the ASEAN region and Malaysia have seen comparatively low 
penetrations of wind and solar PV generation to date, with the notable exception of Viet Nam, which had a 
combined installed capacity of around 21 GW in 2021 (IRENA, 2021d). Bioenergy also currently plays a minor 
role in Malaysia, with nearly 0.2 GW installed in 2021 out of a total estimated potential of 4 GW, implying 
significant scope for growth. The renewable energy resource potential used in this study is provided in Table 9.

Solar PV 337 1.8 1%and geothermal in this analysis were derived from a range of published reputable national and international 
studies (DGE et al., 2021; Handayani et al., 2022; IRENA, 2022d). Given the seasonality of hydropower, its 
generation pattern varies in each country across the year. Thus, the model was calibrated based on the best 
available data that were either provided by national bodies or extracted from the PLEXOS World model 
(University College Cork, 2019). 
To determine the solar and wind energy potentials, an analysis was performed using a geographic information 
system search engine with extraction layers to derive these potentials and their hourly generation profiles 
for five different classes, respectively, of resource quality. This was done using the methodology outlined 
in IRENA (2022d) and by consulting a range of data sources (Amante and Eakins, 2009; Amatulli et al., 
2018; Friedl et al., 2010; Gao, 2017; IUCN et al., 2022; Maclaurin et al., 2019; C3S, 2017). Given the scale of the 
resources, in particular solar, such a representation was crucial in understanding the role that these resources 
can reasonably play in the long-term expansion of Malaysia’s power system, capturing their opportunities 
and challenges for renewable energy integration. It was also important to understand how wind power in 
the country can be expanded, as the quality of this resource and its location may make it too costly to 
effectively harness. 
The methodological approach applied across this study seeks to deliver an assessment that meets the 
growing energy demand across Malaysia while also delivering on several key national and regional goals in 
terms of emission reductions, energy costs and energy security. To do so requires an integrated approach that 
spans the whole energy system of the region and captures the evolution of all energy end-use sectors such 
as transport, industry and buildings out to 2050 with high granularity (e.g. passenger transport, industrial 
process heat, building cooling and miscellaneous appliances, etc.). 
This was achieved using the approach outlined in Figure 40, in which the energy supply and demand 
assessment comprised three separate modelling activities: 1) activity-level demand assessment; 2) capacity 
expansion of the power sector and 3) operational flexibility analysis of the power system. This enabled the 
power system to be expanded based on the understanding gained of how energy demand will evolve and 
what levels of electrification of this demand can be achieved while maintaining system reliability. This in turn 
enabled a tailored capacity expansion to be developed to deliver emissions and energy cost reductions while 
bolstering energy security and access, largely through increased deployment of renewables across Malaysia 
and the ASEAN region in an operationally robust power system. Figure 40 The REmap multi-model approach

Activity level demand analysis Power system capacity 
expansion analysis
Power system flexibility analysis 
For the power sector, the analysis consists of two key parts. The first is a long-term capacity expansion analysis 
for all scenarios of energy demand resulting from the activity tool assessment, with a view to capturing a 
broad range of possible power system developments out to 2050. The second is an operational assessment 
of these scenarios for power system flexibility. For this study, both the long-term expansion and short-term 
operational flexibility analyses were performed using an industry-standard modelling tool, PLEXOS. 
The power system’s long-term expansion was guided by two key questions: 
1) What is the role of national and regional integration in unlocking the potential benefits of a joint energy 
transition strategy?  
2) What is the role of various technologies in achieving a highly renewable and low-carbon power sector? assumptions in the power system expansion modelling. Two of the scenarios – the Baseline Energy 
Scenario (BES) and the PES – were designed to best represent “business-as-usual” and best available national 
plans, respectively. Meanwhile, the TES strives to deliver higher renewable and decarbonisation ambition 
than the BES and the PES, and two different 1.5-S cases (a 90% and 100% renewable power generation case) 
expand on this with a focus on deeper decarbonisation in designing power system technology pathways that 
can deliver a climate-compatible future for Malaysia. The rationale for capacity expansion analysis is shown 
in Table 10, which spans four pillars.  
Many factors need to be considered for proper long-term power sector modelling.

the delimitation of frontiers or boundaries.
To best represent national and international plans for international line expansion, the BES and PES scenarios 
take a more conservative approach to expansion. It can expand cost optimally in a national context but 
is limited internationally to lines envisaged in the most recent ASEAN Interconnection Master Plan study. 
However, in the TES and the 1.5-S the long-term model optimally expands these international lines to achieve 
more ambitious renewable energy integration internationally.7
Integrated system operation enabled by close interconnection can facilitate sharing of generation sources 
and lead to a lower-cost power system due to reduced duplication of effort in energy and non-energy service 
provision (such as ancillary services in the regulation of the system frequency, spinning reserve, and nonspinning reserve). Additionally, to unlock the national renewables potential it will be crucial to understand the 
distribution of these renewables across the country in relation to electricity demand distribution out to 2050. 
Electricity demand growth
Electricity demand growth by 2050 will be very significant in all scenarios (Figure 42), reaching a range 
of between around 305 TWh in the PES and 350 TWh in the 1.5-S, where there is robust electrification 
of end uses. Electrification of end uses harnesses powerful efficiencies and, if done with renewables, can 
provide significant reductions in both final energy demand and emissions. How capacity needs are expanded 
along this horizon is instrumental in a climate-compatible future; high levels of electrification alone will not 
meaningfully reduce emissions unless accompanied by the decarbonisation of power.
Given that 40% of Malaysia’s energy needs by 2050 are met with electricity in the 1.5-S, these scenarios have 
profound implications for the evolution of the power system. The sectoral composition of this demand growth 
also has consequences for the system and, if harnessed with smart operational practices, can improve the 
operability of the system with high shares of renewables.the 1.5-S accelerates this growth, reaching 2.6% annually.

Power capacity and generation
KEY MESSAGES
Rollout of solar PV is a no-regrets option in all scenarios, regardless of renewable 
energy ambition. By 2050 it could reach over 150 GW with most of it located in and 
around key demand centres due to the wide availability of the resource and land, 
with corresponding implications for reinforcement of transmission and distribution 
systems.
Clean dispatchable technologies will be key to balancing resource variability; 
this is analysed in a set of scenarios that explore how this need can be met with 
renewables, batteries and fossil fuel with CCS to better understand the roles these 
technologies can play. The cost and availability of these technologies are pivotal in 
their cost-effective deployment in any highly ambitious decarbonisation scenario.
Achieving the energy transition in a least-cost way will necessitate deeper 
integration of national power systems within Malaysia and regionally with 
neighbours. This allows integrated energy supply planning and minimising 
duplication of both energy and non-energy service provision which can reduce costs 
overall.There are many possible trajectories for power system expansion, but action is needed to avoid fossil fuel 
investments being locked in in the near term, particularly given the prevalence of coal-fired generation across 
much of the country. To give perspective on this evolution of the power system, a central set of scenarios was 
developed in line with the bottom-up demand-side analysis that was performed using the REmap activity tool. 
The developed scenarios are the BES, the PES, the TES and the 1.5-S, comprising the 1.5-S RE90 (90% 
renewable power) and the 1.5-S RE100 (100% renewable power) cases. They constitute a wide range of 
development and provide an understanding of the impact of implementing and not implementing measures in 
the power sector. These five scenarios encompass varying ambitions for emission reductions and renewables, 
reaching renewable capacity shares by 2050 of 70% in the BES, 67% in the PES, 81% in the TES and 91%-100% 
in the two 1.5-S cases (Figure 43). 
Power capacity expansion 
National plans imply that coal power generation capacity is set to expand to 2030 in all scenarios, with 
great implications for sectoral emissions. The BES projects a business-as-usual case where the system is 
optimised for cost alone with no carbon or technology constraints; the PES, meanwhile, is on a trajectory 
of decarbonisation by 2060 in line with national plans, while the TES and the 1.5-S explore more ambitious 
renewable pathways, demonstrating how this coal capacity expansion can be mitigated in the longer term by 
relying on higher shares of solar PV and clean dispatchable power.
To explore the dataset for the power capacity and generation growth, please refer to IRENA’s online data 
visualization dashboard released alongside with the regional study, Renewable energy outlook for ASEAN: 
Towards a regional energy transition (2nd edition) (IRENA, 2022b).
Solar PV will play a key role in Malaysia in all scenarios by 2050.

RE Share %base of Malaysia, it plays a key role regardless of ambition level. However, it would require careful operational 
planning and ancillary service provision to integrate effectively. Under the BES, the total capacity of solar PV 
reaches 39 GW, representing a generation capacity share of 49%. For the other scenarios, the solar PV capacity 
reaches 59 GW in the PES (51% capacity share), 83 GW in the TES (61% capacity share), and 103-153 GW in the 
1.5-S RE90 and 1.5-S RE100 (69-81% capacity shares). 
The vast potential for solar PV, coupled with its well-distributed nature, lead it to become the dominate 
generation source in most scenarios by 2050, with an average build rate in the 1.5-S of nearly 5 GW annually 
to 2050. To integrate such high shares of variable renewable power in all scenarios (although in particular in 
the 1.5-S, as shown below) would implicitly need power system flexibility, transmission expansion and storage. 
It would also have profound implications for system operation, which itself would require the implementation 
of a range of innovative operational practices.
However, it is not only solar PV that is key in meeting the capacity needs in these ambitious scenarios. There 
is also a clear role for clean dispatchable power in its various forms – hydropower, bioenergy, fossil fuel 
generation with CCS, and battery storage – which help to mitigate the diurnal and seasonal variability in the 
solar resource. 
The BES and the PES see significant increases in hydropower capacity to 2050, with the installed capacity 
growing from around 6 GW in 2018 to 16 GW. Because of the strong national hydropower resource in Malaysia 
(estimated at around 29 GW) it features in all scenarios. However, to achieve the more ambitious energy 
transition scenarios, these penetrations are dwarfed, reaching 22 GW in the high-renewables TES and 29 GW 
in both the 1.5-S RE90 and 1.5-S RE100. Here, hydropower provides an invaluable balancing resource because 
of its ability to balance supply–demand variability. 
Biomass power capacity is also envisaged to increase from just a couple of hundred megawatts in 2018 
to a maximum of 5 GW in the 1.5-S RE100 case. However, biomass power represents a lower share of the 
generating capacity mix than other key renewables.
Power generation 
Fossil fuel generation capacity with and without CCS also has a role: the combined capacity share of these 
fuels is 30% in the BES, 33% in the PES, 19% in the TES and 0-9% in the 1.5-S cases. These shares belie the 
value of fossil fuels in being able to deliver power during periods of low variable renewable energy (solar PV 
and wind) and provide valuable system resilience. Additionally, given the range of uncertainty that exists with 
these technologies, this role needs to be carefully explored so that their sensitivity to specific uncertainties is 
well understood. 
These scenarios translate into very different power generation profiles, as seen in Figure 44, with renewable 
shares achieved by 2050 of 38% in the BES, 54% in the BES, 96% in the TES and 90%-100% in the 1.5-S. 
The majority of this comes from solar PV, with a strong role of power imports leading to lower domestic 
generation needs. In the generation mix, the role of individual technologies in meeting demand across the 
year becomes clear. In power systems with high shares of solar PV and other variable renewables, their very 
nature implies that the operation of the system and their use across the year rely on the flexibility of the other 
resources underpinning them. The variability of renewables is mitigated in the ambitious scenarios with lowor zero-emission technologies that can be readily dispatched, such as battery storage, nuclear, and fossil fuel 
technologies with CCS.Figure 44 Power generation growth by technology for all scenarios, 2018, 2030 and 2050

There is one common factor in all scenarios: the decreasing role of fossil-fuel-fired generation and the rise of 
solar PV. However, this requires careful policy design and implementation if it is to be achieved successfully. In 
2018, unabated fossil fuels represented over 80% of power generation, but by 2050 fossil fuels (both abated and 
unabated) have penetration rates in the generation mix that reach 62% in the BES, 46% in the PES, 4% in the TES 
and 0-11% in the 1.5-S. Meanwhile, solar PV represented less than 1% of total generation in 2018, but it rises to 18% 
in the BES, 29% in the PES, 51% in the TES and 51-66% in the 1.5-S. In terms of levelised power generation costs, 
both modes of generation have some of the lowest costs of any power generation technology today. 
While coal power plants have small land requirements as a technology (albeit with many negative externalities), 
the same is not true of solar PV. Solar PV cannot be as easily sited near demand centres as it needs to be 
placed where both the land and resource are abundant, while also considering its proximity to transmission and 
distribution grids. This implies a substantial need for expansion of the transmission network to accommodate 
this solar capacity, which is explored in the following sections. This implies a substantial need for expansion of the 
transmission network to accommodate this solar capacity. One example of this is through the implementation 
of designated renewable energy zones in the country (such as the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy) 
where proper planning can be done to evacuate power from the renewable energy sources.
Hydropower, in particular, plays a key role in meeting demand across the year and in mitigating supply–
demand variability. Hydropower provides 20% of power generation needs across the year in 2050 in the 
BES, 20% in the PES, 38% in the TES and 27-33% in the 1.5-S. Similarly to solar PV, these resources are 
highly location-dependent, so the capacity needs to be co-located with the resource. This has implications 
Note: RE = renewable energy; VRE = variable renewable energy.BES, 0% in the PES, 4% in the TES and 0-4% in the 1.5-S. This implies a reliance on the dispatchability of these 
technologies that increases with the share of renewables achieved in the power system. 
Transmission and interconnection future expansion
National and international interconnections are also pivotal in the expansion of the generation mix in allowing 
for growing power demand to be met over an increasingly distributed system, as seen in Table 11 below. This 
is particularly notable in terms of the increased import dependency in the more highly ambitious scenarios 
out to 2050, which reduces power system costs across the ASEAN region though integrated system planning.
Transmission expansion needs to increase significantly in the energy transition scenarios, especially when 
100% renewable power is pursued.

imported from countries along the Mekong River with most coming from Viet Nam and Cambodia (due to the 
complementarity of their generation mixes with significant wind and hydro power capacities respectively) 
with small flows coming from Laos. However, in the 1.5-S RE90 and 1.5-S RE100 this line is not built, and 
this renewable capacity is leveraged to meet demand for countries along the Mekong River, a case that was 
not fully developed in the TES due to lower demand and renewables ambition. This has the useful insight of 
showing that national planning best not occur in isolation and benefits from a regional perspective – with 
higher domestic renewables ambition in Malaysia being more regionally cost-effective in a climate-compatible 
future than increasing import reliance.
Building a national transmission line, from planning and commissioning to full operation, may take as long 
as a decade. However, much of this expansion is over land and consists of grid reinforcements in Peninsular 
Malaysia and on Sabah (Sarawak is represented by one node in this study, so deeper integration in this region 
cannot be captured). In addition, building a line across large bodies of water, especially between Sarawak 
and Peninsular Malaysia adds a layer of complexity to the entire process (which occurs mainly in international 
rather than domestic line expansion for Malaysia). Therefore, planning should start as soon as possible so as 
not to lag behind the expansion needed under decarbonisation scenarios.
The following Figure 45 shows the key transmission candidates that need to be considered in the near term 
to achieve a highly renewable future.
Transmission expansion is integral in the power sector transformation.

As regards international transmission, expansion is also a significant facilitator of increased renewable energy 
shares in both Malaysia and the ASEAN region as a whole (Figure 46). Not only does this facilitate more 
renewables, but its implications are also much broader for the sharing of generation resources, demonstrating 
the clear economic benefit of deeper regional system integration regardless of any level of renewables or 
decarbonisation ambition. This is a powerful insight gained from modelling all scenarios for the ASEAN region, 
the results of which can be found in the regional report (IRENA, 2022b).Figure 46 Sum total of international line expansion for all scenarios, 2018 to 2030

In terms of the emissions intensity of power generation, in line with the differences in the generation mix 
there are vast differences in the emission reductions that can be achieved (Figure 47). Analysis of overall 
power sector emissions can mask this differences among scenarios due to their vastly different levels of 
electrification. As would be expected, the BES broadly remains at today’s level of emissions intensity due 
to the expansion of coal-fired generation, but this leads to a very significant increase in overall emissions. 
Meanwhile, the PES, which relies on greater amounts of solar PV and on fossil fuel with CCS, reduces emissions 
but cannot achieve zero emissions because of the 90% capture rate of emissions in CCS and the remaining 
unabated coal units. However, the TES and the 1.5-S can reach zero emission intensity by 2050 through the 
deployment of solar PV and the expansion of national and international transmission capacity.
The transition scenarios show declining carbon intensity of electricity generation and steep descreases in 
the 2030-2040 timeframe.

power sector
Decarbonising the power sector of the ASEAN region is a significant challenge, but Malaysia could play a key 
role in making it a reality. Every ASEAN member state has a unique pathway to a highly renewable future and 
a unique mix of renewable energy resources on which to build this future, as shown in Table 12; however, none 
can do this cost effectively in isolation. Interdependence can help deliver a lower-cost power sector for all by 
harnessing economies of scale in energy and non-energy service provision.

The roles that different regions of Malaysia can play in a decarbonised ASEAN power sector depend on a host of 
factors, not least of which are its domestic renewable energy resources, how they are distributed and how this 
corresponds to the situation of neighbouring countries. 
Malaysia itself has heterogenous power systems in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak, and the needs and 
resources of each influence capacity expansion in the 1.5-S RE90 and 1.5-S RE100 cases, with the RE100 case 
largely reinforcing and further expanding the interconnector line and renewable generation capacity expansion 
candidates. 
It is a tale of two halves, with Peninsular Malaysia importing power and Sabah and Sarawak exporting power 
in the 1.5-S, as reflected in the international line expansion shown in Figure 48. The key influence in Sabah and 
Sarawak are their respective hydropower resources, which are larger than their peak electricity demand for 
much of the time out to 2050, even in the 1.5-S with high electrification of energy demand. This is an important 
resource that can balance variable renewable supply regionally and aid regional decarbonisation. Although 
there are offshore wind resources, as observed above, they were not built into any of IRENA’s scenarios given 
the relatively low wind speeds and the large distances from demand centres, mainly in northern offshore region 
of Sabah and Peninsular Malaysia.Box 10 The role of Malaysia in a highly renewable and decarbonised ASEAN 
power sector (continued)
For Peninsular Malaysia, key imports come from Sumatra (Indonesia), owing to natural synergies between both 
regions in terms of resources and the more limited resource potential available for deployment in Peninsular 
Malaysia. Some of these imports from Sumatra are directly exported to Singapore due to its rather limited 
renewables potential, which is reflected in deeper integration of Singapore with Peninsular Malaysia. Despite 
already being interconnected with Thailand, which is of benefit and use in all scenarios and can lead to multinational trading beyond both countries, the 1.5-S within the model does not expand it significantly beyond the 
planned case for direct trading. This owes to them having largely similar generation mixes with a simultaneous 
peak generation of the high solar PV penetrations in each which leads to a reduced benefit of increased 
interconnection for direct trading. 
For both Sabah and Sarawak, their potential role in regional integration becomes clear in light of robust expansion 
of lines between both Malaysian regions, as well as deeper integration of both with Brunei and Kalimantan 
(Indonesia) using land-based interconnection. Similar to the case of Singapore, Brunei in the long term has 
low renewable potential in relation to its demand, which results in deeper integration. However, expansion of 
interconnection with Kalimantan is rather different and must be considered in light of the expansion of lines in 
the 1.5-S RE100 case for Kalimantan with the island of Java, where Indonesia’s largest electricity load centre is 
located and where much of the power flows to from Sabah and Sarawak. 
The Philippines also sees significant expansion of lines with Sabah, due largely to its comparatively low 
renewable energy resource potential leading to rapid scaling of this interconnection to avert the need for nonrenewable power generation. In this regional least-cost optimisation modelling, the hydropower of both Sabah 
and Sarawak is a key resource and makes both pivotal players in a highly decarbonised ASEAN power sector 
with a much sought-after resource.
While beneficial at a regional level, all international expansion of transmission lines would also need to be 
developed with close international collaboration, which highlights the political complexity in developing these 
lines. This is pivotal in ensuring that their benefits and costs are fairly distributed, which should span the entire life 
of the projects, from the project development phase through to mutually beneficial operation in the long term. 
Interconnection with neighboring countries will be important to realise the 1.5-S.

KEY MESSAGES 
Malaysia may be a net importer of electricity overall as part of an integrated 
ASEAN power region. However, while Peninsular Malaysia will predominantly import 
power from Sumatra in the 1.5-S by 2050, Eastern Malaysia will be a net exporter to 
the Philippines, Brunei and Kalimantan. 
Ramping at the portion of the system that has non-variable renewable energy, 
including storage, becomes more frequent as solar is deployed. Nevertheless, 
regions such as Southern Peninsular Malaysia, where the load peak mostly occurs 
during the day, do not experience extreme ramping even at higher integration levels. 
This is also a result of the electrification of end uses. Resources like electrolysers for 
the production of green hydrogen, and electric vehicles help the uptake of renewables, 
but pricing mechanisms for small consumers must be in place (e.g. time-of-use-rates). 
Power storage facilities are set to become operational during 2030-2035 and to 
reach large-scale cost-effectiveness from 2040 onwards. Projects coming online 
before this period will likely be more focused on solving local structural issues such 
as critical network congestion than displacing large-scale supply over time. Storage 
in neighbouring countries is favourable to make solar-based imports less variable 
as well. The technology growth in the period 2030-2050 is very steep, and hence 
planning is needed for the overall industry. 
Spinning reserves equal to 10% of the load can be met at all times by available 
batteries and hydropower resources. Nonetheless, stability protocols need to be 
redesigned as power systems move from synchronous machines to inverter-based 
generation. Results suggest that inertia available in the system by 2050 would not 
be enough to maintain stability after a hypothetical in-feed loss larger than 2 GW. 
The system should be planned to reliably operate with fewer and fewer synchronous 
machines in the future, when grid-forming inverters are likely to assume the leading role.
The full potential of renewables requires new institutional frameworks for the 
exchange of power and the alignment of regulations, including operators beyond 
national borders. There should be no privileges for domestic resources, ideally with 
the ability to book operations through an integrated ASEAN market for generators 
and transmission rights. Standard regulations secure reliability across the region by 
setting norms for the provision of services (energy, regulation, reserves), the amount 
to be procured at each time scale, and the practices followed by system operators.4% increase from the planned pathway despite significant electrification of the energy sectors, which also 
enhance energy efficiency at the end-use level. The share of renewables in Malaysia’s power sector under the 
PES is 52%, of which 23% is supplied by solar generation. That increases to 81% under the 1.5-S RE90 scenario, 
with 27% (95 TWh) provided by hydropower and 49% (172 TWh) from solar. Therefore, roughly half of the 
country’s electricity would be subject to the solar resource availability. Biomass is responsible for 5% (18 TWh), 
and wind does not have any relevant participation in any scenario for the country. Natural gas is responsible 
for 50 TWh and makes up 17% of generation. 
Due to Malaysia’s proximity to the equator, the solar profile does not change much across the year, similar 
to other countries in the region. The natural solar profile creates the needs for storage requirements to help 
match generation with demand, but long-term storage requirements tend to be reduced. This also relates 
to low temperature amplitudes experienced, which do not make demand stable across the year. The nonvariable renewable energy portion of the system must operate flexibly to essentially follow the system net 
load, and flexibility must adapt, to the extent possible, to the availability of electricity in the system. 
Electricity supply and demand must be equal at all time scales. Balancing them is crucial to keep system 
frequency at desirable levels and to ensure stability.8
 Put simply, power system flexibility refers to a power 
system’s ability to respond to both expected and unexpected changes in demand and supply. Given that 
supply must equal demand across all time scales, flexibility is generally the ability of system assets to modulate 
either the production or uptake of electricity according to its availability and price across all time scales. 
This study considers a range of flexibility options to integrate solar generation in Malaysia. They rely on the 
assumption that there will be a price or time-based signal to consumers, or a call from transmission service 
operators under a given framework, to increase or decrease consumption according to the availability of 
electricity at a given moment in time. That can be made under wholesale markets that also include the 
participation of small and medium consumers through aggregators, demand response programmes at 
industrial facilities, and others. 
Flexibility options considered for this study are: 
1) smart charging of electric vehicles (as opposed to charging when it is most convenient for the user, such 
as when arriving at home); 
2) flexible production of green hydrogen; 
3) storage assets to support both arbitrage but also the provision of spinning reserves; and 
4) the expansion of the transmission grid.
Impacts on the non-variable renewable energy portion of the system
Flexibility from conventional generators such as thermal units and hydropower is in principle the most 
elementary way of adjusting supply to the availability of variable renewables. In other words, these units 
should modulate power to meet net load, which is the load minus solar and wind generation. However, 
technologies are different in doing so, with their capabilities being measured in terms of how fast they can 
increase or decrease power (cold, warm start or online), the lowest stable operation level they can operate (as 
they give room to renewables), and others. 
8 Ptdid ttdltt fFditibd tblliitd tiiddload tends to increase. There will be moments in which net load will be close to zero due to massive variable 
renewable energy generation, while there are moments of almost no generation from variable renewables. 
Besides, electrification of end uses increases the overall demand, which in turn stretches the peak further. 
The hourly power ramping indicates the modulation of power that one or more generation units must adjust 
in order to follow solar generation. Typically, the more variable renewables in the system, the higher the 
magnitude of the ramping. Extreme ramping at conventional units in Sarawak and Sabah power systems 
increases significantly. In Sabah, while the range +350 MW/-350 MW accounts for almost 90% of power 
modulation in the PES, the same range accounts for 50% in the decarbonised 1.5-S. 
In Sarawak, the range +50 MW/-250 MW accounts for 99% of ramping under the PES, which drops to only 
35% in the 1.5-S. This means more frequent high-magnitude ramping in both cases, which eventually exceeds 
10 GW in rare cases (Figure 49). Co-ordination is fundamental between dozens of generators to meet ramping 
of 6-10 GW (100-165 MW per minute), which would need to modulate power simultaneously. 
The case in Peninsular Malaysia is slightly different, as the peak load in regions such as the south mostly occurs 
during the day. That is also a result of end-use electrification. Generally, the stronger the solar generation the 
lower the peak, which in turn reduces the operational range for non-variable renewable energy units. As a 
result, ramping increases at the mid-size magnitude, but very little at the extremes, illustrating a synergy of 
solar integration.
Co-ordination between non-variable renewable energy assets helps deal with increasing extreme power 
ramps as a result of solar integration in Sabah and Sarawak. Yet, concurrent solar generation and peak load 
brings synergies and may reduce ramping in Peninsular Malaysia.

SarawakFrom a national perspective, Malaysia may be a net electricity importer in the future (Figure 50). However, the 
country has an interesting role in providing renewables and flexibility to neighbouring countries, in particular 
from Sarawak and Sabah to Kalimantan (Indonesia) and the Philippines. Indeed, Western and Eastern Malaysia 
may remain separate if an interconnection linking the two is not seen as cost effective from an ASEAN region 
perspective. This means that the power deficit in Peninsular Malaysia would be mostly supplied by Sumatra 
(Indonesia). 
Energy deficit in Peninsular Malaysia results in reliance on imports, while Sabah is a net energy exporter.

Resource-wise, the largest solar generating regions under the most ambitious decarbonisation scenarios 
are Central Peninsular Malaysia (23%), Sabah East (18%) and Sarawak (16%), with 25-33 TWh each. They 
are followed by South Peninsular Malaysia (11%), Sabah West (11%) and East Peninsular Malaysia (9%), 
with 12-17 TWh each. Thus, generation is split fairly evenly between Western Malaysia (53%) and Eastern 
Malaysia (47%). Nonetheless, Central and South Peninsular Malaysia are net importers despite generating 
roughly one-third of the domestic solar generation by 2050. The figure is less balanced for hydropower 
resources, where Sarawak produces 67%, and Sabah 18%, together comprising 85% of total generation.
The transmission infrastructure at the national level and cross-border follows the aforementioned context. 
Central and Southern Peninsular Malaysia rely on increasing import levels, which kicks off with a relatively 
small connection with north Sumatra (Indonesia) by 2030. Exchange capacity is enhanced through highnet importer from Sumatra and eventually connects with Kalimantan in the long term. Overall, there is a 
dominant electricity flow that goes from south to north along the peninsula, suggesting import feeds beyond 
connection points. Cross-border connection with Thailand is small across the study, with similar amounts 
flowing in either direction.
Interconnectors permit the least-cost integration of renewables from the ASEAN region perspective. The 
main cross-border flows would be with Sumatra for Peninsular Malaysia, and with Kalimantan and the 
Philippines for Sarawak and Sabah.

1 GWterm, with Sabah West predominantly selling power to Brunei in 2050 (net exports of 10 TWh). Concurrently, 
renewables in East Sabah would require submarine cables crossing the Sulu Sea to reach Palawan in the 
Philippines, operational from 2045 onwards (net exports of 33 TWh).
Sarawak mainly exchanges with Kalimantan, although the overall balance is low with exports to Southern 
Sumatra and imports from the north-eastern region. Additional connections with Kalimantan will follow, 
including a long-length line capacity to southern Kalimantan, which may benefit from the respective 
connection from that region to Java by then. 
Storage facilities interplay with transmission assets and make cross-border exchange key to the energy 
transition 
The natural profiles of solar resources make it impossible to continuously provide electricity without the use of 
a storage device, essentially making it possible to meet demand outside of daylight hours. Short- to mediumterm storage facilities cycle daily to absorb the solar generation and, as such, operate in tight co-ordination 
with power generation. At the same time, interconnectors allow for delivering solar energy to where it is most 
needed, including through cross-border exchange. 
Because Malaysia is an overall net power importer, cross-border electricity plays an important role in the 
peninsular dispatch by 2050. Peninsular Malaysia imports over 100 TWh of solar-based electricity from 
Sumatra in 2050 through the Central and South regions. Storage assets can be placed in Malaysia, making 
solar a reliable and stable provider of electricity throughout the day despite the resource profile (Figure 52). 
Natural gas-based power plants may still have a role in providing peaking flexibility. Electric vehicles make 
good use of low electricity prices during the day, just as electrolysers do in the south and east regions. The 
ability of electric vehicles and green hydrogen to support the system balance is naturally higher in regions 
where both vehicle fleets and green hydrogen production demand are higher.in neighbouring countries enable reliable solar-based imports.

With relatively low demand, Sabah is a net exporter of electricity, sending over 30 TWh (net) towards the 
Philippines, with the power either produced domestically in the eastern region or coming from Kalimantan. 
In this latter case, Sabah serves as a wheeling region (Figure 53). Net exports from the West to Brunei total 
10 TWh in 2050. Internal exchange between the West and East, and between the West and Sarawak, is 
relatively low. Hydropower resources are also exported during the night time. eventually acts as a wheel for exports from/to Kalimantan and from/to the Philippines.

At a significantly larger scale, hydropower is the main generation technology in Sarawak, contributing 
more than 60% of the generation. Thus, the technology operates on the base but also follows the demand 
tightly (Figure 54). The hydropower resource also supports neighbouring regions with flexibility in certain 
moments of the year, although the overall exchange balance is close to zero. Electric vehicles and electrolyser 
consumption are relatively small, so they neither greatly improve flexibility, nor raise flexibility problems. 
Hydropower is the base generation and flexibility provider in Sarawak. The technology eventually also 
supports neighbouring countries.

Note: V1G = unidirectional smart charging of electric vehicles.also present opportunities for battery facilities. In the case of Sarawak, hydropower reservoirs act as storage, 
and therefore other technologies are not needed (Figure 55). This also has implications for the provision 
of spinning reserves in the different regions. Batteries become cost effective mainly from 2030 onwards, 
although sparse projects can come online before this period. 
Storage is cost effective, particularly from 2040 onwards, and the first large-scale systems come online 
starting in 2030-2035.

under the 1.5-S RE90 scenario, 2020 to 2050
Hydropower and batteries are sufficient to meet spinning reserves under scenarios of high renewable 
energy
Spinning reserves are the amount of unused generation capacity at online power assets that are kept in 
stand-by in the event of power shortages or drops in frequency. In practice, reserve providers are required 
to operate below their rated value so they can quickly ramp up power when needed. Reserves requirements 
are typically defined based on the largest power asset (usually a generator, but also transmission lines and 
other assets), the so-called n-1 criteria. In renewable-dominated systems, the installed capacity of generation 
units tends to decrease with distributed and smaller-scale assets rather than large, centralised power plants. 
Therefore, reserve requirements would also reduce. However, transmission capacity tends to increase given 
the increasing need to take power from the best renewable resources to demand centres, which could increase 
requirements. 
In this study, reserves were defined as 10% to 20% of the load for all three regional grids. Reserves can be 
shared within a region (e.g. Perak and East Peninsular Malaysia) but not across macro-regions (Sarawak and 
Sabah). Only hydropower and storage assets were allowed to provide assets by 2050 (upward/downward), to 
avoid having non-renewable assets lock in for this purpose. Whether power electronics are designed to do so, 
battery technologies can deliver a response on a millisecond-scale, being faster than any traditional generator. 
Solar and wind were set to provide downward reserves only (curtailment), although operation adjustments 
ld lllththlitffd available in each region (Figure 56). Whereas batteries meet most of the requirements in Peninsular Malaysia 
and Sabah, hydropower is nearly the only provider in all scenarios in Sarawak. Nevertheless, the decarbonised 
scenario foresees a transmission capacity connecting Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra of around 14 GW, or 
roughly one-third of the average load in the region. Even though the link should be made by two or more line 
circuits (reducing an eventual capacity loss), this illustrates concerns related to exchanging massive amounts 
of power and their impacts on the system operation. 
Spinning reserves are largely provided by batteries as solar grows in the system.

1.5-S RE100based generation. Gradually, less inertia will be available, with diminished ability to oppose changes in 
frequency after a failure, as inertia is inherently provided by synchronous generators such as thermal plants 
and hydropower. The reserves to be procured and the agility needed in today’s power systems is a function 
of inertia conditions. 
Based on assumptions and scenarios considered in this study, inertia provision in Peninsular Malaysia would 
be set at around 50 MW on average, mostly provided by hydropower and natural gas thermal generators. 
This would be enough to roughly maintain the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) at 1 Hz per second after 
a hypothetical in-feed loss of 2 GW, which may be considered a high rate (Figure 57). Two times this number 
would be needed to keep it at 0.5 Hz per second, and five times this value would be needed to keep the RoCoF 
at 0.5 Hz per second after a loss of a 5 GW in-feed, which could potentially be a high-voltage transmission line. 
This matter should be at the forefront of integration studies in Malaysia. Nevertheless, grid-forming inverters 
are on the verge of addressing this issue, allowing operation at very-low or even zero inertia conditions, even 
though further research is needed. Additionally, faster frequency response resources such as batteries and 
different means to signal imbalances will be needed. 
Inertia-based traditional protocols to uphold stability after a system failure will need to be redesigned, as 
operations move from synchronous machines to inverter-dominated generation.

AND LOCAL SOLAR PV INDUSTRY
KEY MESSAGES 
Hydrogen will provide a complementary solution to Malaysia’s ambitious climate 
objective. Hydrogen will comprise up to 5% of total final consumption (including 
non-energy use) in the 1.5-S by 2050, where it will play a role in decarbonising some 
industrial sub-sectors and meet a growing market for green hydrogen trade.
Bioenergy will need to play a bigger role in Malaysia’s decarbonisation efforts 
compared to today, by promoting robust bioenergy policies and improving 
accounting standards across all end-use sectors. Bioenergy demand in the 1.5-S 
will contribute around 14% of total final energy consumption by 2050, mostly in the 
form of liquid biofuel consumed in the transport sector. This will be used both in road 
transport and as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and as a substitute for fossil fuels 
in industrial processes. 
With up to 2 400 GW of solar PV installed capacity required in a 1.5-S pathway in 
the ASEAN region by 2050, Malaysia has an opportunity to expand its current PV 
manufacturing industry to cater to local and regional demand. Becoming a regional 
PV hub can bring multiple socio-economic benefits to Malaysia.
Hydrogen demand and outlook in Malaysia
IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2022 (WETO) envisions that global hydrogen demand in a 
1.5°C scenario would be 600 million tonnes by 2050 (IRENA, 2022a). As more countries raise their ambitions 
to become climate neutral, green hydrogen (hydrogen produced from renewable energy) and synthetic fuels 
derived from green hydrogen can play a key role in the energy transition. This application is especially critical 
in hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as steel, fertilisers, plastics production and the maritime shipping sector, 
as seen in Figure 58. carbon way.

9 With regards to terminology, hydrogen can be distinguished according to its source of supply. Majority being produced today is conventionally produced 
Several energy players in Malaysia have already committed to becoming hydrogen9 supply hubs to key 
demand countries in Asia, such as Japan and the Republic of Korea. The national energy oil and gas company, 
PETRONAS, plans to produce up to 50 000 tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen by 2027 (PETRONAS, 2022). 
Sarawak, with its vast hydropower resources, also has plans to produce up to 1.2 million tonnes of green and 
blue ammonia and 0.2 million tonnes of hydrogen, not only for export but to cater to planned domestic use in 
transport (The Star, 2022). Additionally, the government is developing a hydrogen economy roadmap to set 
the policy pathways for different industry players in the region. Figure 59 Hydrogen demand projection for all scenarios, 2030 and 2050 Clean hydrogen demand (PJ)

IRENA’s analysis projects that in a decarbonised energy scenario (the 1.5-S), domestic demand for hydrogen in 
Malaysia could reach 25 PJ by 2030, then further increase to 213 PJ (1.5 million tonnes of hydrogen) by 2050. 
This represents around 5% of the total final consumption. Around 55% of the hydrogen demand would be for 
non-energy use, such as feedstock for the production of ammonia and methanol. Apart from exporting to 
key markets, hydrogen can be utilised domestically in Malaysia for the industrial sector as well as in transport, 
especially to power trucks and buses.
Situated in one of the busiest international shipping routes, Malaysia has the potential to become a hydrogen 
supply hub for bunkering, and it currently captures around 0.2% of the total international bunkering market. 
IRENA’s WETO 1.5°C Scenario proposes that by 2050, 60% of all fuel needed for international shipping will be 
from hydrogen and its derivatives, including ammonia and methanol; demand in Southeast Asia alone would 
be 1 060 PJ by 2050. Therefore, there is a wide opportunity for Malaysia to capture more of the market share 
either to provide bunkering fuels or to export hydrogen from its excess renewable-based electricity.
Hydrogen supply in a global context 
By 2050, hydrogen demand in Asia could increase nearly six times to reach around 190 million tonnes annually 
(IRENA, 2022g). China, India and Japan are expected to be the largest markets in the region. Beyond meeting 
domestic needs, Malaysia may produce green hydrogen based its strong hydropower resources, especially in 
Sarawak. To date however, most hydrogen export announcements in the country has been for grey hydrogen, 
with potential to eventually produce them from renewable resources. Therefore, there might be a need to 
increase the availability of low-cost capital in the region for the deployment of utility-scale solar facilities, 
together with incentives to reduce cost of green hydrogen production.
IRENA’s recent report Global hydrogen trade to meet the 1.5°C climate goal (Part 1) provides a perspective 
on the hydrogen trade by mid-century based on scenarios from the WETO report (IRENA, 2022g). The study 
highlights that meeting the increasing demand for hydrogen worldwide will depend on matching sources 
of low-cost production with demand centres. Pipelines are likely to be the most cost-effective means of market as fuel for shipping and power generation. Most of the ammonia to be transacted may be consumed 
as ammonia itself, avoiding the need for costly and challenging ammonia cracking.
The study showed that Australia is a step ahead of Malaysia and other ASEAN member states in meeting 
the regional demand. Australia has a vast land area of 7 million square kilometres for renewable energy 
production, which, combined with a low cost of capital, enables the production of green hydrogen that is 
competitive with fossil-fuel-based hydrogen. Australia also has a solid hydrogen roadmap and strategy.

The cost of capital for solar and wind projects in Australia ranges from around 2.9% to 3.7%, which is 
significantly below that of Malaysia, at around 5.5% (IRENA, 2022b). In combination with relatively low 
investment costs, Australia has the potential to produce around 378 EJ per year of green hydrogen at a cost 
below USD 1.5 per kilogram. For illustration, this is higher than Japan and China’s primary energy supplies in 
2020, at 16 EJ and 126 EJ respectively (blue/red vertical lines in Figure 61). Based on current assumptions, 
the cost of capital for the new solar and wind projects necessary to produce green hydrogen would be much 
higher in Malaysia and other ASEAN member states than in other potential world hydrogen exporters such as 
Australia and Chile. Figure 61 Hydrogen cost curve potential based on 2030 values

However, taking into account transport costs, Malaysia’s position as a hydrogen exporter might be more 
favourable compared to Australia, due to the shorter distance to important markets such as China, Japan and 
the Republic of Korea. It would also increase the competitiveness of Malaysia to serve the hydrogen market 
in Asia and the Pacific, where hydrogen production facilities are already being planned in both Peninsular 
Malaysia and Sarawak. Malaysia may also export hydrogen through existing and new pipelines to other 
ASEAN member states and beyond. Malaysia is currently developing a hydrogen technology and economy 
roadmap, outlining opportunities and strategies to become a key hydrogen player and unlock green growth 
across several industries (MGTC, 2021).
A forthcoming report in 2023 will go into more detail on hydrogen supply in the ASEAN region.
Bioenergy
With large arable lands and forests, Malaysia has vast bioenergy potential from its agricultural industry. 
IRENA’s decarbonisation pathway in the 1.5-S envisions up to 680 PJ of bioenergy to be used by 2050 (Figure 
62), consisting of biofuels, biogas, biomass and waste products. This represents around 16% of the total final 
consumption. Biomass will also play a key role in substituting fossil fuels in the industry sector and will serve 
as an alternative to crude oil to produce bio-based plastics.sectors.

IRENA’s study shows that in addition to palm oil, biomass energy resources can be tapped from other crops 
in Malaysia such as rubber and acacia, amounting to 10.4 million tonnes, or 197 PJ by 2050 (IRENA, 2022d). 
These can be used in industrial processes and in combined heat and power plants of up to 4.2 GW 
capacity. Additionally, the Malaysia Biomass Industry Action Plan, released in 2013, has identified major 
bioenergy potentials from agricultural residues and municipal solid waste, which can be used to help reach 
decarbonisation targets (GoM, 2013). Under the feed-in tariff programme, a total of 224 MW of biogas and 
165 MW of biomass power plants had been approved as of the end of 2020, with most of the increase in 
capacity being biogas plants (SEDA, 2021b). A key challenge is understanding national target and policies 
when there are competing demands for bioenergy for food consumption and global export markets.
Biofuels
Under the National Biofuel Policy enforced in 2006, Malaysia has implemented a biodiesel blending 
programme in the transport sector. Blending biofuels for road transport started in 2010, and within five years 
biomass reached a 7% biodiesel blending rate. Today, Malaysia’s biodiesel caters to both the domestic market 
and the export market, with a B10 blending mandate for road transport and a B7 mandate for industrial use 
(Wahab, 2021). A B20 blending target was planned in 2020 but was delayed due to supply chain issues that 
were further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The total biodiesel production capacity in Malaysia as of 2021 was 2.4 billion litres, with 19 biorefineries in 
place. Around one-third of the crude palm oil collected is used for biodiesel production, with actual production 
totalling 860 million litres in 2021 (Wahab, 2021). current capacity in the 1.5-S, and two-fold in the TES, with the blending target raised to B50 starting in 2040. 
However, a key challenge in further ramping up biodiesel production in Malaysia is competing demand from 
the global market for crude palm oil, as well as a lack of labour in the plantation sector, decreasing yields and 
affecting production. A co-ordinated ministerial approach – from a labour, economic, industrial and energy 
planning perspective – is needed to tackle this challenging sector.
For bioenergy as a whole in Malaysia, the key barrier in the past has been a lack of agreement between policy 
makers and line ministries regarding the strategies that are best suited to reaching the nation’s proposed 
targets (IRENA, 2022d). Stronger inter-institutional co-ordination that builds on a prioritised and sustained 
implementation strategy is required, building on successful cases, piloting best practices to scale pilot 
projects and generating institutional capacity to foster minimal agreements that aim to accomplish stepwise goals towards targets that foster the country’s bioenergy potential. Finally, monitoring and integrating 
waste (including municipality waste) and bioenergy into energy statistics – especially the use of bioenergy in 
industry – can be a step forward to inform future energy planning. 
Additionally, embarking on pilot and research studies into characterising different industrial, agricultural and 
municipality waste profiles can be instrumental to build up financially sustainable (via reasonable tipping 
fees), small-scale waste-to-energy plants throughout Malaysia. More importantly, waste-to-energy plants 
should be seen primarily as a waste management strategy to reduce waste in the landfill, while also helping 
in mitigating climate change effects. 
Local solar PV industrialisation opportunities
Solar energy is widely seen to dominate the energy transition future. In 2021 alone, around 257 GW of new 
renewable power generation capacity was added worldwide, and more than half of this was solar PV. Around 
133-140 GW of newly installed systems were commissioned during 2021 alone at the alternating current (AC) 
level, with more than 180 GW of modules at the direct current (DC) level. China dominates today’s global 
PV production, accounting for 66% of all polysilicon, more than 95% of wafers, 78% of cells and 72% of 
modules. By the end of 2022, China was expected to have 500 GW of annual module production capacity and 
550 GW of wafer production capacity (Bellini, 2022)
Malaysia was the leading solar PV module manufacturer in Southeast Asia until 2019, when rapid 
solar PV expansion and production in Viet Nam overtook the top spot (IEA, 2022b). By 2021, Malaysia 
accounted for around 4% of global solar PV module production, only 1% less than Viet Nam and just 
above Thailand (the third leading Southeast Asian producer representing 2% of the total global solar PV 
production) (IEA, 2022b). Nevertheless, Malaysia’s solar PV industry is on the rise, as a result of continuous 
government support, expanding renewable energy policies and investments, and falling costs. Malaysia and 
Viet Nam have been the ASEAN region’s biggest solar PV employers in recent years (IRENA, 2020). 
With Malaysia’s current national renewable energy targets, as well as various schemes that favour installation of 
solar PV plants across the utility, residential, and commercial sectors, a requirement for more robust local solar 
PV manufacturing can present additional socio-economic benefits. In the 1.5-S RE90, 1.4 GW of solar capacity 
expansion is needed annually until 2030, rising to 4.3 GW annually until 2050 (Figure 63). Installations would 
be spread across Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak, with a mix of rooftop and utility-scale systems – 
taking into careful consideration the availability of resources, land and demand centres.annually until 2050 in the 1.5-S RE90 scenario.

Closer co-ordination among the relevant stakeholders from government, industry and the private sector is 
needed to encourage further investments in the PV module manufacturing industry. Greater attention is also 
needed to its synergies with battery storage and grid flexibility, especially considering the region’s anticipated 
boom in solar PV in the coming decades. In total, IRENA’s 1.5-S anticipates up to 2 400 GW of solar PV 
installed capacity in the ASEAN region by 2050 (IRENA, 2022b).
4.5 INVESTMENTS, COSTS AND BENEFITS 
KEY MESSAGES
The total investment requirement in the 1.5-S is double that in the PES by 2050, 
totalling USD 375 billion to USD 415 billion. Power sector investment accounts for 
between 60% and 70% of the total investment required, while the rest are allocated 
to investments into energy efficiency and EV-related infrastructure.
In the short term until 2030, significant investments are needed for renewable 
energy installation capacities in Malaysia – especially for Solar PV. This is equivalent 
of installing 1.4 GW of Solar PV new capacity to the grid every year. Overall in 2050, the annual incremental energy system cost in the 1.5-S is 
USD 9 billion lower than in the PES, and the avoided externalities due to health and 
climate change is between USD 4.0 billion and USD 9.5 billion annually in the 1.5-S 
compared to the PES. Thus, transitioning to renewable energy in the 1.5-S will save 
Malaysia between USD 13 billion and USD 18.5 billion annually. 
Investment needs
In the decade to 2030, a substantial increase in investment is required to accelerate Malaysia’s energy transition 
and to keep the country on a climate-safe pathway (Table 13). Policy support in the energy sectors is critical 
to enable the reallocation of capital towards sustainable solutions and to ensure active participation from 
the private sector. The required clean and renewable energy investment towards 2030 in a 1.5-S amounts to 
USD 47 billion, with around USD 27 billion going into power capacity expansion of the grid and energy storage. 
Investment in decarbonising the power sector and EV infrastructure in this decade is key to the energy 
transition in the 1.5-S.

to the PES, or an additional USD 8 billion invested annually. Malaysia’s required annual investment in the 
energy sector would need to represent around 4% of the total GDP by 2050. In the 1.5-S RE100, an additional 
USD 40 billion would be required to fully transition and decarbonise the power sector. 
The charts in Figure 64 show that three-quarters of the investment in the two 1.5-S cases is dedicated to 
power and grids and storage infrastructure, with the rest going to energy efficiency and electrification in the 
end-use sectors. A more detailed investment breakdown is shown in Table 14. Investments in the end-use 
sectors include additional infrastructure to enhance energy efficiency in all three sectors, new industrial plants 
and retrofits, and critical electric vehicle charging infrastructure for the transport sector. The cost of vehicles 
is excluded from this analysis but would represent an additional USD 60 billion investment in electric vehicle 
sales compared to the PES.
Installing renewable power capacity, providing infrastructure and implementing energy efficiency account 
for the bulk of the energy transition investment.

(Figure 65). Solar PV would account for a large share of all power sector investments, especially in Peninsular 
Malaysia where most of the population is concentrated. Meanwhile, large hydropower investments will be 
crucial in Sarawak and Sabah to further meet the growing electricity demand, both locally and for export to 
neighbouring countries, in the form of either electricity or hydrogen. 
Renewable energy investment in the power sector is spread out evenly across the country in the 1.5-S RE90.

Energy system costs and savings
The total energy system cost includes investment in the new power installed capacities, storage and other 
transmission infrastructure, operations and maintenance, fuel costs and investments, and energy efficiency 
and end-use technology costs. IRENA’s estimates for future fuel costs are based on national and historical 
data, while also considering inflation and price increases for fossil fuels. This was estimated for each fuel 
source – namely oil, coal, natural gas, biofuels and others used in end-use sectors, as well the fuel costs 
required for power generation. 
As seen in Figure 66, total energy system costs in the 1.5-S are comparable to the costs incurred in the PES, 
with total annual savings of USD 7-9 billion in the two 1.5-S cases compared to the PES. While there is more 
spending on low-carbon infrastructure in the 1.5-S compared to the PES, savings can be realised through 
lower fuel costs. Given that Malaysia’s expenditures on fuel subsidies have grown in recent years due to rising 
energy demand, up to USD 240 billion to USD 280 billion in avoided costs can be realised when comparing 
the 1.5-S to the PES in cumulative terms to 2050.to the PES.

The reduced externalities associated with health, environment, and climate change damages in the 1.5-S 
yield an annual avoided cost of between USD 2 billion and USD 4 billion. This implies that the country can 
potentially save between USD 9 billion and USD 13 billion annually, or around 2% to 4% of its current GDP, by 
transitioning to the 1.5-S by mid-century (Figure 67).

USD billionThis section presents a set of short- to medium-term recommendations to address key challenges, support 
the development of the renewable energy market and accelerate the energy transition in Malaysia, based on 
consultation process throughout out the Renewable Readiness Assessment (RRA) study as well the outcome 
from the Renewable Energy Roadmaps (REmap) analysis on Malaysia. 
These recommended actions focus on providing a solid basis for creating a more conducive investment 
environment for renewables. Already, the government is making progress towards the realisation of these 
actions.
5.1 ENERGY SYSTEM AND POLICY PLANNING
To meet rising energy demand while ensuring energy security and affordability in the future, Malaysia stands 
at a crossroads. It must either continue to use its diminishing oil and gas resources, while also turning to volatile 
international oil and gas markets to import energy, or harness the huge untapped potential of renewable 
energy sources that can provide local and affordable alternatives to fossil fuels. The report shows that it is 
cheaper to do the latter, with the share of renewable energy reaching 40% of the country’s primary energy 
mix, up from just 3% today. Such a transition would not only save USD 7 billion per year, but also reduce the 
need to budget for fuel subsidies.
The energy landscape in the country would change from one dominated by fossil fuels, which represent 
around three-quarters of primary energy demand, to one that sees deep electrification across all end-use 
sectors – making up 40% of final energy consumption, with another 20% coming from renewables. This entails 
scaling up electricity demand from around 150 TWh in 2018 to more than 348 TWh by 2050, while also scaling 
key renewable resources such as bioenergy, geothermal and hydrogen.
IRENA’s analysis also shows that there are various gaps and opportunities in the buildings, transport and 
industry sectors in Malaysia. Each of these end-use sectors can play a larger role in reducing energy sectorrelated emissions in the long term. A key measure is electrification in the transport sector, greatly increasing 
the uptake of electric vehicles while also considering urban planning and transport policies that will reduce 
private vehicle use and energy demand in the long term. Another measure is to emphasise energy efficiency 
measures across all sectors – using low-carbon technology, strengthening standards and labelling practices, 
recycling waste materials and integrating renewables as much as possible into the energy mix. 
Meanwhile, there is a growing demand for low-carbon fuels such as bioenergy, biofuels, e-fuels and hydrogen 
globally in IRENA’s 1.5-S towards 2050 (IRENA, 2022a). Malaysia can position itself as a reliable partner and 
supplier of these alternative fuels – given that national targets, needs and mandates are met first.
KEY CHALLENGES AND 5 RECOMMENDATIONSAction 1 Utilise the long-term opportunities of the energy transition – through the 
development of cohesive and integrated long-term energy planning 
strategies
Malaysia has taken important steps to transform its energy system to a more secure, clean and affordable 
one in the future. However, more attention is needed to integrate various policies including, and beyond, the 
power sector towards a more comprehensive and transparent long-term energy policy and planning strategy, 
aimed at energy transition and achieving climate targets. This includes streamlining targets and policies from 
different sectors: power, utilities, manufacturers, automotive, transport, industry and trade, natural resources, 
environment, etc. IRENA’s Malaysia energy transition outlook (METO) can be good starting point and reference 
towards modelling further Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS) and energy scenarios, 
whose progress can be reviewed and updated on a periodic basis. The strategy and policies should prioritise clean 
energy investments that are consistent between national and regional (renewable) energy policies. These can also 
help to operationalise Malaysia’s climate action plans and net zero targets in the long term while helping to align 
the ambition level of the country’s NDC with the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
Privatisation of Malaysia’s energy sector has been in place since the 1990s. The New Enhanced Dispatch 
Arrangement (NEDA), established in 2015, arranges the scheduling and dispatch of generation used by the 
Single Buyer. However, since the fourth quarter of 2020, when solar energy reached the maximum allowable 
capacity, the NEDA is no longer available for application for the price takers, although it should be open as 
long as the requirements are met.
An important initiative is called MESI 2.0 which aims to open the market to diversity and competition to 
improve flexibility and cost efficiency and to empower consumers. It is a crucial step in Malaysia’s power 
reforms. Renewable energy is a central theme of this package, with a focus on consumers. However, as of the 
time of this writing, only some initiatives of the MESI 2.0 were ongoing, with others either under review or 
delayed in implementation.
Action 2 Advance electricity market design
It is crucial to continue the MESI 2.0 implementation and to widen opportunities for renewable energy investors 
to participate in the electricity market, in order to increase transparency, reduce financing costs for investors 
and make electricity prices more realistic, while remaining affordable to consumers. At the same time, any 
improvements to the electricity market design must ensure the financial sustainability of its participants (from 
utilities, suppliers, system operators, prosumers, and consumers) to future-proof it against fluctuation and 
uncertainties of global energy market, whilst having the long-term goal of reducing government spending on 
fossil-fuel related subsidies. 
5.2 REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK
Using Malaysia’s renewable energy potential to reach its current targets and then go beyond them requires 
an enhanced regulatory framework for renewables. Several areas require further attention in achieving these 
targets.
The feed-in tariff mechanism has enabled the generation of more than 4 TWh of electricity annually from 
renewable energy resources. Half of this total came from biomass and biogas and another 40% from solar PV. 
Project developers interviewed during the study have noted that in addition to e-bidding requirements, other 
criteria could be included to assess the projects. Independent third-party assessment of the technical and 
financial viability of projects could be helpfule.g. the Water Rights Agreement, according to industry players. To sign a financing agreement, first a power 
purchase agreement needs to be secured. This agreement is under the authority of the state governments, 
where each state has its own decision-making and different permit approval processes. In some states, it is 
based on gross revenue, whereas in others it is based on other schemes.
According to stakeholder interviews, while financing is available, financiers are looking for projects with good 
rate of returns. When the tariffs are too low, this makes financing challenging. At the same time, the FIT has 
limited opportunities to grow further because it is challenging to reflect this in the surcharges applied in tariffs.
The bids received under the Large Scale Solar programme that started in 2016 show that renewables are 
gaining a business case in Malaysia. The tender guidelines of the LSS programme have improved greatly, 
and more criteria are now included to make sure projects are delivered. This has also helped financiers. The 
operational issues faced during the initial rounds of the LSS programme have been resolved. Additionally, 
outlier bids with very low bid offers can be disqualified, where in the initial LSS phases, land-acquisition and 
other unforeseen financial and material costs has led to project cost overruns.
From the interview process conducted with stakeholders, available sub-station and grid capacity issues were 
mentioned that might limit the success of projects under the LSS programme. Due to high solar irradiance, 
the LSS plants in northern Malaysia are very full and causing grid connection issues. This results in investors 
competing for land acquisition. The process for land acquisition can take 1-2 years, which is a lengthy period 
from an investor perspective (and also increases upfront investment costs), making this an important financing 
issue. Because of this, many LSS projects have been penalised in the past, and the approval time could be 
long. 
Because of land issues, the eastern and southern parts of the country could offer better areas for solar 
development. However, LSS plants located in some remote area face interconnection infrastructure limitations. 
Since the interconnection facilities fall under the scope of LSS developers, this increases their project costs 
and may make them less competitive. Finally, the number of new LSS rounds is not clear, which presents 
difficulties for investor planning and for policy consistency. The project size at a single site could also be 
increased.
The role of TNB, as the sole electricity provider in Peninsular Malaysia, could be defined better in the LSS 
programme. Because TNB is the sole provider of transmission infrastructure, one view is that its scope could 
be limited to expanding the grid infrastructure instead of competing for renewable energy capacity through 
its subsidiary. Another view is that it should also be allowed to compete for renewable energy capacity build 
out.
Action 3 Develop a stronger regulatory framework by enhancing the LSS 
programme and a well-functioning FIT mechanism
Malaysia’s renewable regulatory framework has advanced considerably with an availability of options for 
renewable energy investments. There is a need to strengthen the e-bidding system of the FIT with respect 
to project selection criteria and to overcome financing issues. To ensure the continued success of the LSS 
programme, regularity and periodicity are needed for a predictable investment environment, and solutions will 
need to be developed related to land use and grid connection issues. 
While the solar PV market in Malaysia is dominated by grid-connected PV systems driven by the LSS 
programme, the distributed renewable energy market is also growing thanks to the Net Energy Metering 
Offid iihkthilftPV d ditibtd tld bin the entire country. Although electrification is nearly 100% in Peninsular Malaysia, it was around 96.9% in the 
Sarawak region (Afrouzi et al., 2021).
A more decentralised electricity system in Malaysia is expected to impact the market in the future. Measures 
will be needed to integrate the potential excess electricity generation from an increasing share of solar PV 
systems. In addition, the ST and market operators (not yet established, as currently it is a Single Buyer market) 
would need to consider adopting rules and practices that are conductive to integrating distributed resources 
into the wholesale market. There is no timeline yet for this, and the distributed resources are connected to the 
distribution grid, requiring system operators to develop solutions for integration. In addition, network tariffs 
need to be made more efficient to reap the benefits of distributed energy resources (OIES-UNITEN, 2021).
During the NEM 1.0 and NEM 2.0, several reasons for slow progress include the insufficient tariff payments, 
caps on sales back to the grid and restrictions of third-party installation. Initially, the NEM had limited tariff 
payments and aimed for self-consumption rather than grid sales. It started off with payment at a displaced 
cost, which then later improved to one-to-one offset. Since then, together with the financing scheme offered 
by the solar PV investor, capacity installations accelerated. Under the NEM 3.0, customers in the residential 
and governmental segment continue to enjoy the one-to-one offset rate. However, this is not the case for the 
commercial and industrial segments, where the aim is still self-consumption (and the tariff is at the system 
marginal price, which is much lower). 
The NEM contract is for 10 years only, which provides only a small incentive for customers and investors. 
The payback period is 5-6 years, but by year 10 customers can no longer sell electricity to TNB and may 
need to invest in additional battery storage, which increases the capital costs. There are also uncertainties 
in the regulatory framework that will follow the NEM. This is especially important for residential customers. 
The commercial and industrial customers can claim tax incentives, resulting in a shorter payback period 
of 3-5 years. Finally, it is not clear how the NEM will continue in the coming years once the current cycle 
concluded by the end of 2023.
NEM 3.0 programme implementation can be enhanced. In the earlier phases of the NEM, investments were far 
below the quotas. There is readily increased awareness and interest in rooftop solar PV from all segments, but 
limited quotas and the lack of incentives seem to hamper growth in this segment. Reducing the payback periods 
of investments is an area that deserves more attention, considering the available business and finance models 
(leasing or PPA services) offered in the retail market for solar PV systems. Additionally, via the Supply Agreement 
of Renewable Energy, the payment for solar energy is channelled directly to the solar PV investor (ST, 2022e). 
The direct payment to the financial institutions that financed the PV investors’ project is still under discussion.
Additionally, the government announced the Corporate Green Power Programme (CGPP) in late 2022, where 
the private sector can undertake a corporate PPA with a solar PV producer, further incentivising the uptake 
of renewables (ST, 2022b). The CGPP also encourages the trading of renewable energy certificates between 
both parties, fulfilling their environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) commitments.
Electricity tariffs are the determining factor in the further uptake of rooftop solar PV systems. The opportunities 
that an Enhanced Time of Use tariff offers for different types of customers to enable more rooftop solar 
PV investments need to be better understood. In light of the increase in fuel costs that directly impacts 
consumer electricity prices globally, having the correct electricity price signal and educating consumers can 
trigger behavioural change to reduce demand, invest in energy-efficient appliances and vehicles, and consider 
investing in rooftop solar PV as an energy-saving measure.Action 4 Develop new policy mechanisms for increased participation of various 
consumers and open new renewable energy markets, including using 
models beyond the traditional PPAs
It is necessary to develop new policy mechanisms to increase economic viability and to encourage the participation 
of various consumers and clarify the next steps in the rooftop solar PV market once the NEM 3.0 has ended. 
To ensure the success of the NEM programme, new business and financing models should be developed. These 
should be tailored to the economic viability of such systems for various consumer groups, including the effective 
use of voluntary markets such as renewable energy certification and corporate sourcing, complemented with an 
enhanced time-of-use electricity tariff.
Overcoming the regulatory and market barriers in power purchase agreements and renewable energy certificates 
along with the development of a corporate sourcing framework can help Malaysia create new markets for 
renewable energy investments. Reviewing the current terms and conditions of renewable energy PPAs to address 
concerns raised by investors might be needed. With the roll-out of the corporate PPAs in late 2022, feedback from 
the private sector needs to be solicited on a regular basis, as well as having strong monitoring and accounting 
standards to report the various renewable energy programmes available. 
Given Malaysia’s export-oriented economy and the many emerging business entities that are looking for 
renewable energy sources to meet their emission reductions, corporate sourcing of renewables is expected 
to become an important business model in the country. A scheme for corporate sourcing of renewables has 
been in place since 2022 with the GET programme. Earlier, TNB offered myGreen+ as a premium scheme 
for customers who want to deliberately procure renewable energy via the TNBX (a subsidiary of TNB) and 
the Malaysia Green Attribute Tracking System (mGATS) as a national marketplace for renewable energy 
certificates (MGATS, 2022). Effective operation of such voluntary markets through regulatory support and 
platforms to monitor and validate certificates could create new opportunities.
Additionally, rooftop solar PV and small hydropower plant developers have shown interest in peer-to-peer 
electricity trading, and a pilot project was implemented by SEDA. This would be a particularly interesting 
option following the ending of the NEM 3.0 in 2023.
Corporate PPAs could be a new option to sell power directly to end users. There is significant interest in this 
model from investors, given the limitations of the NEM and self-consumption, while solutions will be needed 
to overcome the power wheeling charges. 
5.3 TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION
Given Malaysia’s significant renewable energy resource availability, there is a realistic potential for the share of 
renewable capacity in the total generation mix to exceed what is already planned. This will be important given 
Malaysia’s dispersed population centres and economic activity. It may require the development of additional 
measures to ensure system flexibility. However, there is limited country-wide analysis that investigates the 
extent to which the transmission grid can accommodate renewable energy resources.grid integration studies. In addressing system stability concerns due to higher shares of renewables, the 
master plan for the region foresees the development of five units of a battery energy storage system with 
a capacity of 100 MW planned for installation annually into the system from 2030 to 2034 (ST, 2021b). 
Depending on how the renewable energy share increases, energy storage could come into the system much 
earlier (including potentially more cost-effective behind-the-meter and distribution grid-connected systems). 
Analysis suggests that currently it is more profitable to install large-scale solar only compared to systems 
that have integrated battery energy storage. Storage becomes more profitable at smaller storage capacity 
integrated with large-scale solar systems (Laajimi and Go, 2021). Pumped hydropower storage could also be 
a viable option for hydropower plants in Malaysia, but the viable areas need to be identified and the business 
case needs to be understood better (IRENA, 2019).
Most of the population centres in Sabah are located along the coasts in the western and eastern parts of the 
country, with mountains dividing the two coasts. Currently, infrastructure availability is insufficient to connect 
the major towns of Sabah. This was a major reason to achieve full electrification in the region. Additionally, 
electrification becomes more expensive because land access limits grid connections. The grid that is divided 
between the western and eastern coasts of Sabah is connected via the 275 kV Kolopis-Segaliud transmission 
line. This provides electricity to the east coast, while other areas rely on off-grid connections. There is a need 
to meet growing electricity demand to grow economic activities in major towns and tourist areas, while also 
addressing frequent grid interruptions. 
Also, combined-cycle gas turbines run inefficiently to support spinning reserves on Sabah during off-peak 
periods. The east coast is dependent on electricity flows from the west coast. Generation capacity is currently 
supported by inefficient and costly diesel generator sets (ST, 2019). To minimise cost issues related to the 
transmission grid connection, the Ministry of Rural Development could also contribute to financing the 
projects in certain areas.
TNB already aims for a more flexible and enhanced grid for Peninsular Malaysia that should allow for the grid 
integration of renewables and enable the charging of electric vehicles. Grid modernisation with smart meters 
and a system to optimise voltage flows will be essential to achieve a smarter, more efficient and more resilient 
grid, such as the one being planned in Sarawak (Sarawak Energy, 2020). The approved share of the capital 
investments between 2018 and 2021 that dealt with energy transition was equivalent to 12.3%. In the proposed 
investment plan to 2024, this share was higher at 19.3%.
Some biomass plants face grid connection issues. Interconnection costs could limit investments in remote 
locations far from the grid. High interconnection costs limit the number of viable investment sites to around 
one-third of the country’s mills. According to developers, for projects located more than 7 kilometres from the 
grid, the connection needs to be set up by the developer. This additional cost makes projects economically 
unfeasible (EY, 2021). For instance, to connect to the grid in the Sabah region, renewable energy producers 
need to build transmission lines to the nearest sub-station or existing transmission grid. The FIT is not sufficient 
to cover grid costs (Hashim, Khairuddin and Ibrahim, 2015; ST, 2019). Many issues for biomass are similarly 
valid for wind and small hydropower plants, which are also constrained by resource-driven location choices 
and are far from population centres.
Additionally, limitations in the capacity of the grid where the project will be connected may impact project 
size. For instance, this results in scaling down the project size to be able to connect to the grid, making 
financing a challenge due to economies of scale; meanwhile, the same transmission cost applies to the investor 
irrespective of the project size. countries will be an important enabler for realising higher shares of variable renewable energy resources. 
Currently the government allows for cross-border sales through a pilot project to wheel 100 MW of power.
Action 5 Improve system flexibility for cost-effective integration of renewables
Harnessing Malaysia’s significant renewable energy resource potential is limited by grid issues. There is a need for 
an ambitious and long-term plan with an emphasis on specific regions that shows the extent that renewables can 
be integrated to the transmission grid, with solutions to overcome the current challenges of grid integration and 
to create the flexibility needed to enable this. Flexibility must be harnessed in all sectors of the energy system, 
from power generation to transmission and distribution systems, storage (both electrical and thermal) and, 
increasingly, flexible demand (demand-side management and sector coupling with smart cooling and electric 
vehicle charging systems). 
Innovation is an important driver in the end-use sectors towards aligning these sectors with a net-zero energy 
pathway. Changes are needed not just in the fuels that are consumed, but also user habits and structural 
change, infrastructure and technology. Several emerging technologies stand-out as of particular importance. 
One is electric-mobility, where wide-scale adoption of electric vehicles will need to take place across road 
transport. This will entail significant investment in electric charging infrastructure. In industry, greater 
electrification is necessary, but so is shifting energy demand to clean energy carriers such as green hydrogen 
and biomass based residues and waste. This will necessitate some changes to the types of technologies used 
in industry, and the upstream fuel supply chain. In heavy industry some level of carbon dioxide removal will 
also be required. Large demand sectors will also require more active participation in the power markets, 
shifting demand to times of peak supply, and also potentially offering means of flexibility, though, for instance, 
storage provision.
Action 6 Support enabling technologies in the end-use sectors with a focus on 
hard-to-abate sectors
Transforming how end-use sectors consume energy is crucial in enabling a net-zero energy system. Attention 
needs to be paid to challenging sectors, such as transport and industry. The government needs to consider 
programmes that support key enabling technologies in these sectors, for instance by focusing on electric vehicles 
in transport and related charging infrastructure. In industry, clean fuels will be required, including support for 
green hydrogen. Wider principles of supporting changes to use habits, wider structural change and circular 
economy should also be considered and supported through government policy.
5.4 RENEWABLE ENERGY FINANCING
For large-scale projects in Malaysia, current experiences show that financing is not a major issue. However, 
project bankability for some technologies is an area that warrants further attention. For instance, financial 
challenges are the main reasons for withdrawing from the FIT. In the case of solar energy, financing may prove 
to be a challenge as the country has been practicing PPAs that provide a secured revenue. 
Uncertainties in the MESI 2.0 implementation may not provide a clear direction for a merchant market, 
including for renewable energy. The merchant market via the NEDA uses the system marginal price that is 
predominantly determined based on the PPA. This does not provide strong incentives for merchant plants 
including renewable energy. Additionally, it creates a challenge for banks to provide loans. If the formulation 
and parameters to determine the system marginal price can be made public, this can help financing.financial returns from solar PV investment and benefits, as well as the lack of an easy application process and 
reasonable loan interest rates (Vaka et al., 2020). There are some difficulties in accessing financing for smallscale projects and projects where TNB is not the off-taker, such as in East Malaysia. For small-scale projects, 
major limitations include grid access, the availability of feedstock for biogas projects and counterparty 
strength. Typically, small-scale projects are financed on a corporate finance basis because project financing 
is not often available. 
At the start of 2021, only 7 out of the total 47 projects in the pipeline reached the development stage. This 
highlights the difficulty in accessing funding (EY, 2021). In the future, if the off-takers are planned to be 
other than TNB, it would be necessary that these institutions are financially credible, which would avoid any 
financing challenges.
The Green Technology Financing Schemes (GTFS) is a crucial tool of Malaysia to accelerate renewable energy 
uptake. Currently, most investments are in the local currency, as required to benefit from the GTFS. Earlier 
experiences, however, have shown that currency devaluation may impact investors. Although the government 
has taken actions to increase the tariffs in response to investor requests, potential risks related to currency 
need to be addressed. Additionally, the GTFS provides a subsidy on the loan. This is not typically used for the 
financial modelling due to the lack of clear guidelines, especially on GTFS 2.0. As a result, financiers could 
develop the financial models without the GTFS. 
The GTFS 3.0 is restricted with a minimum investment of USD 50 million (MYR 200 million), but for wider 
use it can be open for all volumes, since the current setting offers only limited opportunity to small-scale 
investors. Additionally, the GTFS application and approval processes are complex, and they require a long 
time, discouraging investors from taking benefit of them.
After years of experience with the FIT and the LSS schemes, investors are more confident about project 
returns, and there are cases where investors are willing to accept returns below 10%. Biomass industries are 
eligible for renewable energy categories under the GTFS supported by 28 participating financial institutions. 
Eligible business models range from waste cooking oil to biofuel, energy pellets, dried long fibre, biofertiliser, 
animal feed, biogas and biomass power plants, etc. However, out of 626 approved GTFS projects between 
2011 to 2017, 37 projects were for biomass pellets or biomass power plants and another 38 for biogas plants. 
GTFS certificate holders do not get a guaranteed approval for automatic loans from the participating financial 
institutions, since these institutions have their own project evaluation criteria. The majority of GTFS projects 
approved by participating financial institutions focus on solar PV because banks have a better understanding 
of this business model. Typically, biomass pellet and biogas plants are financed. More engagement with 
bankers is needed for the purpose of accessing finance for a wider range of biomass projects such as 
biofertiliser, animal feed, bio-plastic, bioengineering products, etc. 
As the case of solar energy has shown, engagement of banks with investments creates knowledge and 
competency. But most commercial banks find financing certain types of renewable energy projects rather 
risky, since such projects are still a relatively new field. The absence of long-term feedstock supply agreements 
between the renewable energy project developers and feedstock owners is another factor (Leong, 2021). For 
other types of renewables, studies highlight that banks remain sceptical about the viability of renewable 
energy projects due to uncertainties about their cost effectiveness, profitability, scalability and high 
development costs (Lawrence et al., 2020). project viability, a lack of track record or success studies, and a lack of knowledge concerning green technology 
(Amran et al., 2018). There are examples where smaller banks are more pro-active in financing renewable 
energy projects; however, they are constrained by capital availability. In the case of small hydropower, data 
reliability is questionable: although a lot of data mining is needed, and many resources are used, the data 
could still not be correct or suitable, which creates uncertainty in financing. GITA, concluding at the end of 
2023, has been a helpful mechanism for cash flow, providing tax relief for a period of 13 years.
Action 7 Accelerate renewable energy finance
Ensuring financing of renewable energy investments remains an important barrier to accelerating Malaysia’s 
energy transition. There is a need to assess and understand the barriers and needs of the market to develop 
suitable financing products and models tailored to individual renewable energy technologies and to strengthen 
the capacity of national financing institutions to enable their use, coupled with a transparent electricity market 
design. REFERENCES
