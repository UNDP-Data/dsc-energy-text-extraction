November 2005 FOREWORD 
As embodied by the Niue Strategic Development Plan (2003-2008), the people and 
the Government ofNiue are mindful of the need to put in place the policies and the 
programmes necessary to meet the requirements of the nation and our aspirations 
for future growth. The decision to update Niue’s energy policy stems from the need 
to take into account the political, economic and social changes that have taken place 
in the last 10 years in Niue. Concerns for the environment and the more efficient use 
of energy have evolved further, together with security of supply and concepts of 
sustainable development that have come into increasing prominence. Global market 
issues, in particular the dramatic increase in oil prices experienced in 2005 create 
new opportunities as well as challenges for supporting energy projects that develop 
indigenous resources and diversify supply. 
In this spirit of planning for a sustainable and prosperous future, the Energy Committee
respectfully submits to Cabinet the Niue National Energy Policy (NEP) and the 
National Energy Action Plan (NEAP). The National Energy Policy provides a 
guideline for decision makers to select ways to meet the energy needs of the 
country. The NEP takes a broad approach, but provides specific policy statements 
on what the Government intends for the energy sector as a whole. It does not 
attempt to deal with strategies for implementation. These strategies are presented 
as separate document, the National Energy Action Plan that is based on the NEP. 
The NEP will be reviewed every five years while the NEAP will be reviewed and updated within the framework of the regular budgeting every year. 
The Niue National Energy Policy and the Niue National Energy Action Plan were 
formulated through the close collaboration of the Niue Energy Committee with a 
large number of national stakeholders from both the public and the private sectors. 
Broad national consultations were held in November 2005 with assistance from the 
Manager of the Pacific Island Energy Policy and Strategic Action Planning Project 
Gerhard Zieroth. The Government is grateful for the contributions of all stakeholders 
in formulating the documents through to their final stage.

What is Niue's National Energy Policy?
Niue's National Energy Policy represents the Government's vision for the development of its 
national energy sector over the next 10-15 years. It sets down briefly and precisely on paper 
the Government's policies or goals for the planning and management of each of the subsectors that make up Niue's energy sector. Importantly, it provides a predictable and explicit 
framework within which public and private energy sector participants can make informed 
planning and investment decisions and manage their operations for the long term. 
The Energy Policy Statement will remain applicable for an extended period of time. The 
reason for this is that a policy such as "To minimize Niue's dependence on petroleum 
products by actively encouraging fuel conservation and efficient end-use" will remain crucial 
for the Niue economy for many years to come. In this respect, the Statement is largely 
timeless, and will only require revising if the Government's vision for the national energy 
sector were to change. 
Key principles determining the policies are: 
 Economic efficiency (higher value of net output per unit of input); 
 Energy efficiency (higher value of net output per unit of energy input); 
 Energy conservation (reduced absolute amount of energy used); and 
 Environmental protection (minimizing energy related environmental costs and 
impacts). 
At times, these principles may not be simultaneously achievable, and policy makers may 
need to determine the relative priority of the principles over the long term and the potential 
trade-offs between them. 
The Energy Policy Statement does not attempt to specify the tasks or the time frame 
necessary to achieve its policies; an Energy Policy Statement is a statement of the 
Government's long term vision for its energy sector. However, as an essential part of this 
policy formulation process, Government has also formulated policy guidelines that provide 
the blueprint for its energy officials in their development of energy sector work programmes 
and budgets. 
Such energy sector work programmes and budgets must be integrated in the regular 
budgeting process of the Government once the NEP Statement has been adopted. With an 
adopted NEP in place the task of planning and agreeing on effective and co-ordinated 
national energy sector work programmes and budgets is much easier. 
Why have an Energy Policy Statement? 
A secure, reliable and cost-effective supply of energy is essential to economic growth and 
development. But energy comes at a cost, most immediately in terms of its direct price to the 
consumer and its impact on the environment. The energy sector also requires scarce 
development capital. In most Pacific island countries, the energy market does not always operate to minimize these costs. Hence, Governments have a clear role to put in place and 
manage a comprehensive and internally consistent policy and regulatory framework within 
which their energy sector will operate. 
This does not imply that the Government should directly control or participate in all energy 
sector activities. In most cases, these have been seen to be more efficiently and cost 
effectively performed by the private sector. The role of Government, then, is primarily to set 
the regulations and standards and to ensure that they are adhered to, to provide information 
and advice, and to influence/change market signals where necessary. 
Implementing Energy Policy
The general approach to policy implementation places emphasis on transparency, 
inclusiveness of political and operational levels and accountability. Implementing the NEP 
will therefore attempt to achieve the following: 
 To make government’s activities in the energy sector more transparent; 
 To build public confidence in the policy and the policy implementation process; 
 To clarify accountability and organisational roles; 
 To communicate policy in a manner which is clear and understandable for all; and 
 To integrate various government policy processes. 
Energy Policy implementation must be carefully co-ordinated with other social sectors and 
also be co-ordinated between energy sub-sectors. If a policy framework for energy sector 
development is to be effective, it must reflect of the perspectives of government, consumers, 
utilities, investors and other stakeholders, and be designed to overcome their concerns and 
meet expectations. Policy implementation will be based on the NEAP and on annual work 
programmes. 
Energy work programmes and budgets clearly state: 
 The tasks to be undertaken to achieve specific policies; 
 The priority and time frame in which they are to be implemented; 
 The resources required for each task; and 
 The agency responsible for undertaking the tasks. 
Work programmes need to be frequently updated in the framework of Governments regular 
annual budgeting process as specific tasks are completed and priorities change. 
Governments have a range of instruments to achieve an energy policy. They include: 
 Physical and technical planning 
 Regulations and regulatory controls; 
 Technical standards; 
 Direct investment or investment inducing policies; 
 Education awareness and promotion; and 
 Financial instruments such as pricing, taxes, duties and subsidies. . 
However, past experience suggests that policies will not be achieved if Government does 
not commit itself at the outset to providing the necessary resources and institutional support, 
and to identifying and removing impediments to their success. NIUE NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY (NEP) 
Through the implementation of cost-effective, equitable and sustainable energy policies, 
the Niue Government seeks to increase the welfare of the people of Niue and the economic 
growth of the nation in an equitable and sustainable manner. 
1. Energy Sector Planning, Co-ordination, and Management 
Planning

use of affordable, and appropriate sources of energy, taking into account a balance 
of social, cultural, technological, institutional, environmental, economic, and global 
market issues. 
 To promote sustainable energy options for electricity generation, transportation, 
water supply, health care, education, telecommunication, tourism, food supply, and 
income generation. 
 To Promote the development of appropriate regulatory guidelines to meet the needs 
of consumers resulting from sector reforms. 
 To Promote policy mechanisms for efficient use of energy in all sectors of the 
economy. 
 To Promote the involvement of all stakeholders, including non-government 
organizations, local communities especially youth and women in policy development

address the reduction of fossil fuel imports and greenhouse gas emissions and strive 
to meet regional renewable energy targets. 
Coordination 
 To efficiently co-ordinate Niue energy sector activities of organizations, associations, 
the private sector, non-state actors and development partners. 
 To mobilise development assistance and financing from international and multilateral 
development partners and the private sector, for the implementation of national and 
regional energy strategies. 
Management 
 To ensure that processes are transparent, reflect effective management and good 
governance with due regard to best practice and commercial requirements. 
 To provide appropriate energy-related training opportunities within Niue at all 
educational and professional levels. 
 To promote an inter-disciplinary approach to energy training and capacity building 
programmes that merges the physical sciences (physics, engineering, mathematics) 
and the social sciences (economics, management) 
 To accelerate human resources development in the power utilities in the areas of 
production, transmission and distribution.  To accelerate research and development of energy technologies that are appropriate 
for adoption within Niue. 
 To Increase training and pubic awareness on alternative and renewable fuels and 
vehicles, energy efficiency, and conservation through publicity campaigns and school 
curricula. 
 To develop community capacity for project planning and management of 
conventional and renewable energy projects. 
 To promote, develop and strengthen an enabling environment within the energy 
sector for all stakeholders, including non-government organizations, local 
communities especially youth and women, through gender mainstreaming and public 
awareness on energy-related gender issues. 
2. The Petroleum Sector 
 To establish and maintain an efficient, semi-autonomous and commercially 
orientated petroleum corporation, the Niue Bulk Fuel Corporation, that is able to 
provide ongoing, cost-effective and reliable petroleum supply for Niue. 
 To ensure that petroleum storage and handling facilities are located to satisfy 
Government, consumer and supplier requirements in the most optimal and safe 
manner and to ensure that the facilities have sufficient holding capacity to satisfy 
ongoing consumer demand under normal re-supply schedules. 
 To secure a reliable supply of petroleum products at minimum landed cost and 
conforming to agreed product quality compliance, standards and specifications. 
 To minimise dependence on petroleum products by actively encouraging fuel 
conservation and efficient end-use, and by utilising more environmentally friendly 
cost-effective alternatives. 
 To ensure the safe handling and storage of petroleum products, and to minimise the 
environmental and health impacts of petroleum handling, storage and waste 
disposal. 
 To regularly review retail pricing of fuel to reflect landed supply cost price fluctuation. 
3. The Transport Sector 
 To maximise fuel conservation and efficiency in the transport sector. 
 To minimise the detrimental impact of petroleum product consumption in the 
transport sector on the land, air and marine environment. 
4. The Electricity Sector 
 To establish and maintain an efficient, semi-autonomous and commercially 
orientated power corporation, the Niue Power Corporation (NPC), that is able to 
provide an ongoing, cost-effective, affordable, use-friendly and reliable electricity 
supply to meet the developing demand for electricity in its areas of service.  To ensure that NPC power system expansions are economically and socially 
justifiable, and are based on a least cost development strategy (overall life cycle 
cost) that, amongst other options, incorporates demand side management to reduce 
peak loads and conserve power. 
 To achieve full cost recovery from consumers, Government and private, for the 
provision of electricity and related services. Where subsidies for electricity 
consumption are considered appropriate by the NPC Board, such subsidies will be 
identified in the Government budget. 
 To carry out quarterly reviews of tariff considering fuel prices and supply costs to the 
end-users. 
 To minimise the detrimental impact of the power generation and distribution system 
on the environment and the community. 
5. New and Renewable Sources of Energy
 To promote sustainable energy options for power generation including solar, wind 
and biomass energy resource. 
 Assess and promote the natural resource potential and improve the technical 
capacity to meet Niue’s energy needs. 
6. Environmental Aspects
