11 ENERGY
I. INTRODUCTION
11.01 During the Seventh Plan period, the focus of the energy sector was on
the sustainable development of depletable resources and the diversification of
energy sources. The policy to reduce dependence on oil resulted in the rapid
development and usage of natural gas. For the electricity subsector, the main
thrust was ensuring adequacy of generating capacity as well as expanding and
upgrading the transmission and distribution infrastructure. The use of new and
alternative energy sources was encouraged and measures were also undertaken
to utilize energy in an efficient manner.
11.02 For the Eighth Plan period, concerted efforts will be undertaken to
ensure the sustainable development of energy resources, both depletable and
renewable, in meeting the energy demand of the economy. The energy sector will
be further strengthened to support the development of Malaysia into a knowledgebased economy, thereby enhancing its resilience and competitiveness. Efforts
will be intensified to ensure adequacy, quality and security of energy supply,
encourage greater utilization of gas and renewable energy as well as provide
adequate electricity generating capacity. In addition, the development of industries
that produce energy-related products and services will be supported for both
the domestic and export markets.
II. PROGRESS, 1996-2000
11.03 In line with the National Energy Policy, the energy sector developed new
approaches and facilities to meet the diversified needs of the economy during
the Seventh Plan period. Efforts were undertaken to ensure adequate and reliable
supply of energy and at the same time increase efficiency and enhance productivity
of the sector.306
Energy Demand
11.04 Commercial Energy. Expansion in the manufacturing and transport sectors
increased the final consumption of commercial energy, which grew at an average
annual rate of 4.7 per cent, from 928.2 petajoules (PJ) in 1995 to 1,167.1 PJ in
2000, as shown in Table 11-1. This led to a marginal increase of the energy
intensity of the economy from 5.6 gigajoules (GJ) in 1995 to 5.7 GJ in 2000.
The per capita energy consumption increased at a lower rate of 2.5 per cent to
50.1 GJ in 2000, compared with 44.3 GJ in 1995.
11.05 In terms of energy mix, there was a shift in consumption from oil and
petroleum products to alternative sources of energy especially natural gas, thus
demonstrating the success of the National Depletion Policy and the Four-Fuel

Diversification Policy. In particular, the final consumption of gas, electricity as
well as coal and coke grew at 8.2 per cent, 7.7 per cent and 4.9 per cent per
annum, respectively. However, the country’s overall energy mix was continuously
reviewed to ensure the long-term reliability and security of energy supply.
Concurrently, the possibility of developing other sources of energy, such as
renewable energy, to supplement the conventional sources of energy was also
considered.
11.06 The industrial sector was the largest energy consumer, utilizing 37.1 per
cent of the total final commercial energy demand in 2000, followed by the
transport sector at 36.2 per cent and the residential and commercial sector at 12.7
per cent, as shown in Table 11-2. Industries that contributed to the increase in
energy consumption included rubber, wood, glass, cement and food processing.
In the transport sector, the increase in private and commercial vehicles as well
as the expansion in the national road network contributed to higher energy usage.
In addition, developments in the railway system, particularly the light rail transit
in the Klang Valley and the inter-city commuter train service, also increased
electricity consumption.

Energy Supply
11.07 The total supply of energy during the Plan period increased by an average
of 5.3 per cent per annum, from 1,293.7 PJ in 1995 to 1,674 PJ in 2000, as shown
in Table 11-3. The main sources of energy supply were crude oil and petroleum
products at 53.1 per cent of total energy supply in 2000, followed by natural
gas at 37.1 per cent, coal and coke at 5.4 per cent and hydro at 4.4 per cent.
During the Plan period, the share of crude oil and petroleum products declined,
while that of natural gas increased, thus indicating the success in reducing
further the overall dependence on a single source of energy and developing
alternative sources of supply.
Crude Oil
11.08 Reserves, Exploration and Production. Malaysia’s reserves of crude oil
declined by 17 per cent, from 4.1 billion barrels to 3.4 billion barrels during the
Plan period, as shown in Chart 11-1. The decline was mainly due to sustained
production and the maturity of existing fields. Although new fields were discovered,
they were smaller in size with less deposits. In view of the need to increase
reserves, Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) ventured into upstream activities
abroad by securing several exploration acreages in Algeria, Angola, Chad, Gabon,
Indonesia, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Turkmenistan
and Vietnam.

11.09 Average production of domestic crude oil declined from 663,000 barrels
per day (bpd) in 1995 to 606,000 bpd in 2000, as shown in Chart 11-2. During
the Plan period, the production averaged 627,000 bpd, of which 63 per cent was
from Peninsular Malaysia, 23.2 per cent from Sarawak and 13.8 per cent from
Sabah. The production of condensate, however, increased from 42,000 bpd in
1995 to 74,000 bpd in 2000.
11.10 Utilization. Domestic crude oil was largely exported due to its premium
quality. The export of crude oil decreased from 399,000 bpd in 1995 to 345,000
bpd in 2000, as shown in Chart 11-2. However, with the increase in world oil
prices, the export value of crude oil increased by an average annual rate of 16.3
per cent from RM6.7 billion in 1995 to RM14.2 billion in 2000. With the
commissioning of the refinery in Melaka in 1997, Malaysia has six refineries
with a total capacity of 520,000 bpd for domestic consumption and export. These
refineries supplied more than 80 per cent of the total domestic demand for

petroleum products, thus reducing the import of petroleum products such as
diesel, fuel-oil and bitumen and increasing the export of certain products such
as kerosene, liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and aviation-fuel.
11.11 Price. The price of crude oil stabilized in 1996 within the range of
US$18 to US$22 per barrel. However, prices weakened in 1998 due to decline
in demand and an increase in supply, to reach a historic low of US$10 per barrel.

Subsequently, the significant production curtailment by members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) lifted oil prices. At the same time,
the earlier than expected recovery from the Asian economic crisis, reversed the
trend and by June 2000, crude oil prices rose above US$30 per barrel. Consequently,
the average price of Malaysian crude oil increased to US$29.58 in 2000 as
compared with US$18.34 per barrel in 1995.
Natural Gas
11.12 Reserves, Exploration and Production. Natural gas reserves declined
marginally from 84.7 trillion cubic feet (tcf) in 1995 to 84.2 tcf in 2000 but
remained four times the size of oil reserves, as shown in Chart 11-3. Most of
the total reserves in 2000 were found off Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak. This
figure, however, does not include the 8.6 tcf of gas reserves discovered in the
Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area in 1998. Gas production increased
to 4,951 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) in 2000 from 3,551
mmscfd in 1995, as shown in Table 11-4. The 39.4 per cent increase was mainly
due to the higher consumption by the electricity and industrial sectors.
11.13 Utilization. The power sector continued to be the main consumer of gas
accounting for 80.7 per cent of total gas utilization in 2000. The expansion in
gas utilization was contributed, inter alia, by the increased application of the
combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) technology in Peninsular Malaysia.
11.14 The non–power sector accounted for 19.3 per cent of total gas consumption
in Peninsular Malaysia in 2000, out of which 45 per cent was by the petrochemical
industry. Gas from the Peninsular Gas Utilization (PGU) is being supplied to
small industrial, commercial and residential consumers through the Natural Gas
Distribution System. An average volume of 65 mmscfd of gas was supplied to
consumers in the Klang Valley, Pasir Gudang, Kluang, Gebeng and Kemaman.
In the residential sector, piped gas was connected to 22,000 homes.
11.15 With the implementation of the natural gas for vehicles (NGV) programme,
a total of 18 public NGV refueling stations and two private NGV outlets were
built, while 3,700 vehicles were converted to operate on natural gas. In 1998,
PETRONAS was given the approval to import in stages 1,000 monogas taxis,
of which 300 were in operation.312
11.16 The use of gas was further diversified during the Plan period with the
introduction of the gas district cooling (GDC) system. The GDC, which utilizes
gas to produce chilled water for air-conditioning and waste heat for power
generation, helps to lower the peak load demand and reduces investment for
peaking capacity. Three GDC plants at the Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC),
Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and Putrajaya started operation
during the Plan period.
11.17 Export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) increased from 9.9 million tonnes
in 1995 to 15.5 million tonnes in 2000. Japan remained the largest market at 72.4
per cent of total LNG export, followed by Taiwan at 14.5 per cent and South
Korea at 13.1 per cent. Malaysia’s export earnings from LNG in 2000 were
RM11.3 billion, a three-fold increase compared with RM3.1 billion in 1995. In
terms of its contribution to the country’s total export earnings, the LNG share
increased from 1.7 per cent in 1995 to 2.9 per cent in 2000.

Note: 1 Total gas produced at wellhead.
11.18 Price. The gas price for the power generation sector in Peninsular Malaysia
was fixed at RM6.40 per million British Thermal Unit (mmBTU) for the period
May 1997 to December 2000. For the non-power sector, the gas price was
derived from the average price of competing fuels and pegged to the medium
fuel oil (MFO) price index. For small industrial, commercial and residential
customers using less than two mmscfd, the price was based on a regulated tariff.
11.19 Investment. During the Plan period, RM35.4 billion was spent for exploration
and development of petroleum activities, of which RM12.9 billion was expended
by PETRONAS, through its subsidiaries. For oil-related downstream activities,
a total of RM5.3 billion was spent on the construction of an oil refinery in
Melaka and a multi-product pipeline stretching from Melaka to the Klang Valley.
A total of RM8.0 billion was invested mainly for the gas infrastructure and
related facilities. The commissioning of the fifth and sixth gas processing plants
and the third dew point control unit in 1999, with an investment of RM2.7
billion, increased total gas processing capacity to 2,000 mmscfd, with a standby
capacity of 750 mmscfd. Phase III of the PGU pipeline project, which covered
450 kilometres, involving an investment of RM3.5 billion, was also completed.
To enhance the security of supply, PETRONAS undertook the PGU Loop 1 and
2 projects with pipelines running parallel to the existing PGU I and II from
Kerteh to Meru, as shown in Chart 11-4. The PGU Loop 1 project was completed314

in 1999 with an expenditure of RM680 million. In addition to the PGU system,
a 379-kilometre gas reticulation network, with an investment of RM164 million,
was constructed in Peninsular Malaysia to provide a constant supply of gas to
industrial, commercial and residential consumers. In addition, RM946 million
was incurred in the construction of the three GDC plants at the KLCC, KLIA
and Putrajaya.
11.20 The gas sector underwent structural changes from being primarily a
source of fuel to becoming an important input for the production of value-added
manufactured products for domestic as well as the export markets. A total of
RM14.7 billion was invested by the petrochemical companies, including
PETRONAS, for the production of aromatics, ethylene and its derivatives in
Kerteh and Pasir Gudang, propylene and its derivatives in Gebeng as well as
ammonia and urea in Gurun.
Coal
11.21 The use of coal as an energy source in electricity generation was aimed
at ensuring system security and reliability. Total coal reserves, which are mainly
in Sabah and Sarawak, increased from 974 million tonnes in 1995 to 1,050
million tonnes in 2000. However, the development of local coal resources was
not aggressively pursued because most of the deposits were located in the
interior areas, which lack infrastructure, and therefore uneconomical to be fully
exploited. Coal production increased from 114,100 tonnes in 1995 to 310,000
tonnes in 2000, which was utilized by the Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation’s
(SESCo) power station at Sejingkat, with a capacity of 100 megawatts (MW).
The total coal requirement of this plant was 300,000 tonnes per annum. Another
coal-fired power plant completed was the Phase III, Tenaga Nasional Berhad’s
(TNB) Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah power station in Kapar, with an
additional capacity of 1,000 MW. The new plant started its trial run towards the
end of the Plan period by utilizing imported coal.
Electricity
11.22 The electricity supply industry experienced major changes during the
Plan period, particularly the restructuring of the three major utilities, namely
TNB, Sabah Electricity Sdn. Bhd. (SESB) and SESCo, which took place
consequential to the privatization programme. These included further streamlining316
of TNB’s operations, divestment of its thermal plants as well as the privatization
of Lembaga Letrik Sabah (LLS), which was subsequently known as Sabah
Electricity Sdn. Bhd. With the operation of the Independent Power Producers
(IPPs), the major utilities were relieved of the need to provide capital investments
for new power plants to meet the nation’s increasing electricity demand.
11.23 Generation. TNB’s share of total generation in Peninsular Malaysia was
maintained at 63 per cent with the remainder contributed by the IPPs. The IPPs
contributed 40 per cent in Sabah and 36 per cent in Sarawak. However, towards
the end of the Plan period, the share of TNB’s total generation was reduced by
2,750 MW as a result of the divestment of its thermal plants in Tanjung Kling
and Kapar. A total of 3,849 MW of new capacities was installed by the three
main utilities as well as the IPPs, as shown in Table 11-5. This comprised a total
of 3,233 MW for Peninsular Malaysia, 298 MW for Sabah and 318 MW for
Sarawak.
11.24 Peak demand increased from 7,212 MW in 1995 to 10,673 MW in 2000,
averaging 8.2 per cent per annum, as shown in Table 11-6. However, peak
demand in Peninsular Malaysia was affected by the economic crisis and registered
a lower average growth of 8.1 per cent per annum. Following the recovery,
demand grew by 10.1 per cent, peaking at 9,712 MW in 2000 compared with
8,819 MW in 1999. With an overall reserve margin of 32.2 per cent, the supply
of electricity was adequate to meet the demand of the economy.
11.25 Following the economic recovery, demand for power is expected to
increase resulting in the need for additional capacity from the year 2008 onwards.
To meet this demand, the Government revived the Bakun Hydroelectric Project
and entrusted Sarawak Hidro Sdn. Bhd., a company under the Minister of Finance
Incorporated, to be the project implementing agency. By the end of the Plan
period, the construction of the project’s river diversion tunnels was 95 per cent
completed.
11.26 Generation Mix. The increased utilization of CCGTs, particularly by the
IPPs, and the continued conversion of TNB thermal plants to gas, contributed
to the increasing number of gas-fuelled power plants in Peninsular Malaysia. As
a result, the share of gas as a generating fuel increased from 67.8 per cent in
1995 to 78.7 per cent in 2000, as shown in Table 11-7. This was in line with
the policy to promote the utilization of a more environment-friendly fuel. The
preference for gas technology was also due to its higher thermal conversion rate.
In Sarawak, gas also remained the biggest component in the generation mix317 Malaysia Plan Ma

11.30 Distribution. The distribution network in Peninsular Malaysia was expanded
and reinforced, increasing the network capacity from 54,050 cct-km in 1995 to
182,133 cct-km in 2000, as shown in Table 11-9. Similar expansion and reinforcement
works were also undertaken in Sabah and Sarawak, where a total of 3,045 cctkm and 2,464 cct-km were added to the distribution network, respectively.
Efforts were focused to reduce the number and duration of supply interruptions
to consumers. Under the reduction of disruption programme by TNB, various
measures to reduce interruption incidences included analyzing data of
breakdown incidences, identifying disruption causes and conducting detailed
technical studies.
11.31 In Sabah, the distribution network was further strengthened with the
completion of several new substations and distribution lines, which among others,
included the 33/11kV substations in Papar and Sandakan, 33kV overhead distribution

11.34 Productivity and Efficiency. Improvements in productivity and efficiency
were recorded in all the three utilities during the Plan period, as shown in
Table 11-12. In Peninsular Malaysia, units sold per employee increased from
1.65 gigawatthour (GWh) in 1995 to 2.49 GWh in 2000 and similarly for Sabah
and Sarawak, from 0.63 GWh to 0.90 GWh and from 0.85 GWh to 1.34 GWh,
respectively. Improvements in the transmission and distribution systems also
contributed to a significant reduction in interruption incidences from 275,380
in 1995 to 43,846 in 2000 in Peninsular Malaysia. In Sabah, the incidences
declined from 26,258 to 11,871, however those in Sarawak increased slightly
from 2,084 to 2,991. Nevertheless, the System Average Interruption Duration
Index (SAIDI) of the three utilities improved. For TNB, the SAIDI improved
from 769 minutes per customer per year in 1995 to 319 minutes per customer
per year in 2000, while that of SESB from 3,150 to 2,520 and SESCo from 481
to 314.324
11.35 Price. Electricity tariffs amongst the utilities were determined by supply
cost and returns to the industry. Average electricity tariff for domestic consumers
in Peninsular Malaysia increased by 17.3 per cent from 20.03 sen per kilowatthour
(kWh) in 1995 to 23.5 sen/kWh during the Plan period. Sabah maintained its
tariff at 24.4 sen/kWh while that in Sarawak was reduced to 27.1 sen/kWh from
28.5 sen/kWh.
Renewable Energy
11.36 Sustainable development of energy resources was undertaken during the
Plan period. A holistic approach was adopted in promoting the utilization of
renewable resources such as biomass, biogas, municipal waste, solar and minihydro. In this regard, a project on the Development of a Strategy for Renewable
Energy as the Fifth Fuel was undertaken to assess the renewable energy (RE)
potential in the country and consider the legal, regulatory and financial framework
in order to encourage the utilization of renewable resources.
11.37 Other efforts undertaken to promote the use of RE included the
establishment of the RE data base at Pusat Tenaga Malaysia. Universiti Sains
Malaysia established the Centre for Education and Training in Renewable Energy
and Energy Efficiency (CETREEE) to increase public awareness of the positive
attributes of RE and energy efficiency (EE) measures. CETREEE conducted
training and dissemination activities, which included the designing of RE and
EE modules for teaching in schools and universities.
Energy Efficiency
11.38 In line with Malaysia’s commitment to moderate the increasing energy
intensity trend and avoid wasteful energy usage, EE measures were undertaken
during the Plan period. These measures included energy audits in selected industries
and commercial complexes as well as the utilization of more energy efficient
processes and technologies. A project on the Development of an Energy Efficiency
Strategy was carried out to evaluate the legal, regulatory and financial framework
with the aim of promoting the efficient utilization of energy. In addition, an
industrial energy efficiency improvement programme was implemented to encourage
EE measures in eight manufacturing subsectors, namely wood, pulp and paper,
iron and steel, cement, rubber, glass, ceramic and food. Other initiatives included325 Malaysia Plan Ma
laysia Plan Malay
sia Plan Malaysia
Plan Malaysia Pl
Chapter 11
8
increasing public awareness on EE measures, the potential of energy savings and
positive attributes of alternative fuels as well as increasing public access to
information on energy efficient technologies.
Regulatory Framework
11.39 To ensure the orderly development of the electricity supply industry, the
Electricity Supply Act 1990 was extended to cover Sabah following the privatization
of LLS in 1998, while that of Sarawak continued to be regulated by the Sarawak
Electricity Ordinance 1992. These legislations provided for the issuance of
licences for power generation, transmission and distribution; establishment of
performance standards and obligations of the licensees; promotion of competition
in the generation and supply of electricity; protection of consumer interest; and
safety of electrical installation and equipment.
11.40 The Gas Supply Act 1993, which was enforced during the Plan period,
provided for, inter alia, the issuance of licences for gas supply activities, regulation
of the quality and volume of gas supplied through the pipelines and the promotion
of safety and efficiency. This legislation was applicable to the transmission of
gas after the city gate station and the supply of gas to residential, commercial
and industrial consumers through pipelines, storage tanks or cylinders.
Vendor Development
11.41 During the Plan period, Bumiputera participation in the electricity supply
industry was further enhanced through TNB’s Entrepreneur Development
Programme, which included assistance in the manufacture of selected products
used by the industry, extension of advisory services to contractors and dialogues
with the relevant Bumiputera trade associations. By the end of the Plan period,
there were 42 Bumiputera vendors involved in the manufacturing of transmission
towers, transformers, switchgears, feeder pillars, cable slabs and cable accessories,
street lighting and accessories as well as meters. The Vendor Development
Programme established by PETRONAS benefited 43 Bumiputera vendors engaged
in manufacturing and technical service in the oil and gas industry, which mainly
comprised the manufacture of heat exchanges, steel gratings, spiral wound gaskets,
cable slabs, plastic lubricant containers and wire rope slings as well as the
provision of services such as plant/tank maintenance and helicopter charter
flights.326
Research and Development
11.42 Research and development (R&D) by the utilities focused on the electricity
supply industry, such as product innovation, quality assurance and testing services
as well as developing leading-edge technologies. Efforts undertaken included a
demonstration project of a 3-kW grid-connected solar photovoltaic system,
introduction of an integrated computerized monitoring system for gas turbines
at the Paka Power station, development of a database programme for power plant
components, implementation of a techno-economic study to upgrade the 120
MW steam turbine at the Tuanku Jaafar Power Station and research on coal ash
utilization. In the petroleum industry, R&D included hydrocarbon exploration,
exploitation and product development, innovations of processes and products as
well as development of fuel cell performance and microbial biotechnology.
III. PROSPECTS, 2001-2005
11.43 Sustainable development of the energy sector will continue to be the main
thrust of the Eighth Plan, aimed at contributing towards enhancing the nation’s
competitiveness and resilience. In this regard, the focus of the sector will be on
ensuring adequate, secure, quality and cost-effective supply of energy, promoting
its efficient utilization and minimizing the negative impact on the environment.
The provision of quality supply of electricity will be crucial as the economy
becomes more technology and ICT-driven as well as to cater to the manufacturing
sector’s shift to high-technology. Towards this end, the strategies of the energy
sector for the Plan period are as follows:
❏ ensuring adequacy and security of fuel supply as well as promoting the
utilization of gas and renewable energy;
❏ ensuring adequacy of electricity supply as well as improving productivity
and efficiency;
❏ developing the energy-related industries and services as well as increasing
local content;
❏ promoting Malaysia as a regional centre for energy-related engineering
services; and
❏ encouraging efficient utilization of energy, particularly in the industrial
and commercial sectors.327 Malaysia Plan Ma

Energy Demand
11.44 Commercial Energy. During the Plan period, the overall demand for
energy is expected to increase at 7.8 per cent per annum to 1,699.8 PJ in 2005,
as shown in Table 11-1. The energy intensity of the economy is anticipated to
increase marginally from 5.7 GJ in 2000 to 5.9 GJ in 2005. The expected
improvement in the quality of life of the population will also result in an increase
in energy usage. In this respect, per capita consumption of energy is expected
to increase by 5.8 per cent per annum from 50.1 GJ in 2000 to 66.4 GJ in 2005.
11.45 In line with the increased planned capacity in the power sector, the
demand for natural gas as well as coal and coke, is expected to grow at 9.0 per
cent and 8.1 per cent per annum, respectively. Electricity demand is projected
to grow at 9.3 per cent per annum, thereby increasing its share of the total energy
demand to 18.8 per cent in 2005. Per capita electricity consumption will also
increase at the rate of 7.3 per cent per annum to 3,472.5 kWh in 2005.
11.46 The demand for petroleum products is projected to grow at 7.2 per cent
per annum, mainly from the transport and manufacturing sectors. However, in
line with the National Depletion Policy and the fuel diversification policy, the
share of petroleum products to the total commercial energy demand is expected
to decline to 67 per cent in 2005.
11.47 The industrial and transport sectors will continue to be the major energy
consumers in line with their anticipated growth during the Eighth Plan period.
For the industrial sector, energy demand is expected to grow at 8.5 per cent per
annum, accounting for 38.2 per cent of the total energy demand in 2005, as
shown in Table 11-2. Energy demand by the transport sector is projected to
increase at 8.7 per cent per annum and its share of the total energy demand is
expected to match that of the industrial sector in 2005. Rapid growth for energy
demand by this sector will be due, inter alia, to the increasing requirement for
transportation and distribution services by the manufacturing and construction
sectors. In addition, the growth of West Port of Port Klang as a regional cargo
centre, Port of Tanjung Pelepas as a transhipment hub and the KLIA as an
aviation hub, will also result in an increase in demand for energy. At the same
time, the development of the transportation infrastructure, such as the Express
Rail Link from KL Sentral to KLIA and the Rawang-Ipoh double-tracking railway
project, will also lead to an increase in energy usage. The usage of energy for
the residential and commercial sector is also expected to increase by 7.6 per cent
per annum during the Plan period.328
Energy Supply
11.48 The security and reliability of energy supply will be ensured through an
optimal energy mix predominantly based on domestic resources. To meet the
energy requirements of the country, the total supply of energy is expected to
reach 2,374.8 PJ in 2005, as shown in Table 11-3. The contribution of crude oil
and petroleum products is anticipated to decline to 50.8 per cent, while that of
natural gas and coal is expected to increase to 39.9 per cent and 5.9 per cent,
respectively, by 2005. At the same time, efforts will be intensified to encourage
the utilization of renewable resources for the generation of energy. In this
respect, the fuel diversification policy, which comprises oil, gas, hydro and coal,
will be extended to include RE as the fifth fuel.
Crude Oil
11.49 Exploration and Production. The nation’s crude oil reserves is anticipated
to last at least another 10 years. To sustain the reserves, efforts that will be
undertaken include developing potential small fields and enhancing the production
of matured fields. In addition, exploration in deep-water areas will be continued,
especially in Sabah and Sarawak. This will enable the average production level
to be maintained at 600,000 bpd during the Plan period. To attract investments
in exploration activities, more favourable terms of the production sharing contracts
will be considered. Other efforts to sustain oil production will include the
acquisition of state-of-the-art technology in exploration and production as well
as intensification of research in oil recovery and reduction of cost. To further
enhance the recovery rate, efforts will be directed towards improving productivity
and efficiency. Domestic production will be supplemented by the supply of crude
oil from PETRONAS’ ventures in Africa, Middle East and Asia.
Natural Gas
11.50 Exploration and Production. To sustain the long-term supply of gas,
efforts will be intensified to develop domestic resources and secure supply from
PETRONAS’ foreign ventures. Gas from the Joint Development Area, managed
by the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority, is expected to come onstream in 2002,
with an initial production of 290 mmscfd, which will increase to 550 mmscfd
by the end of the Plan period. The Trans Thailand-Malaysia pipeline project from
Songkhla to Changlun, with a capacity of 300-600 mmscfd, is expected to be329 Malaysia Plan Ma
laysia Plan Malay

completed during the Plan period and this will further enhance the nation’s
security of gas supply. In addition, gas will also be obtained from West Natuna
and South Sumatera while the possibility of importing LNG from PETRONAS’
overseas ventures will be explored.
11.51 Utilization. By the end of the Plan period, 1687 mmscfd of gas is expected
to be used for electricity generation, as shown in Chart 11-5. The completion
of the two new GDC plants at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS in Perak and
Tanjung Langsat Industrial Area in Johor will further diversify gas utilization.
In addition, two GDCs will be constructed at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak and

GAS UTILIZATION, 1995-2005330
Putrajaya. The efficient utilization of gas will be implemented through centralized
utility facilities (CUF) that supply electricity, steam, de-mineralized water, oxygen
and nitrogen to the petrochemical plants. The completion of the two CUF plants
in Gebeng and Kerteh, is expected to enhance the competitiveness of the nation’s
petrochemical industry.
11.52 To facilitate the greater utilization of NGV, an additional 31 NGV outlets
will be constructed and 7,500 vehicles converted to run on dual fuels. In addition,
vehicles fitted with the NGV system will be manufactured locally by the end
of the Plan period. Promotional programmes to increase public awareness on the
benefits of using NGV will be intensified.
11.53 In line with the implementation of the Second Industrial Master Plan
(IMP2), the synergy between the gas and petrochemical industries will be further
strengthened with the completion of the integrated petrochemical complexes in
Gebeng, Kerteh and Tanjung Langsat. The integrated petrochemical complexes
will produce feedstock for the petrochemical industry and derivatives required
by local industries. The availability of petrochemical derivatives is also expected
to serve as a catalyst for further downstream investment, particularly in the
manufacture of industrial and consumer products, which are mainly imported,
such as engineering-plastics, thermo-plastics, paints, coatings, adhesives, detergents,
polyester fiber resins, textiles and cosmetics.
11.54 Investment. A total of RM61.5 billion will be invested by the petroleum
industry during the Plan period. Of this, RM41.5 billion or 67.5 per cent will
be spent for exploration, development and production activities by PETRONAS
and its production sharing contractors. Another RM8.1 billion will be expended
by PETRONAS to further develop infrastructure and facilities to attract foreign
investment in gas-related industries. Of this, RM7.4 billion will be utilized for
the Malaysia Liquefied Natural Gas 3 project in Sarawak and the balance of
RM700 million for the completion of the 240 kilometres of the PGU Loop 2
pipelines from Segamat to Meru, which is also parallel to a section of the
PGU II. PETRONAS will spend another RM2.0 billion to construct support
facilities for the efficient operations of the integrated petrochemical complexes,
such as centralized tankage facilities, Kuantan-Kerteh railway link, Dungun
water supply, Kerteh marine facilities and Kuantan bulk chemical storage and
piperack facilities.
11.55 To achieve self-sufficiency in selected petrochemical products, a total of
RM6.9 billion will be invested by PETRONAS and other local companies,
mainly on a joint-venture basis with leading multinationals. Gebeng and Kerteh331 Malaysia Plan Ma

will be the centres for gas-based petrochemical industries producing propylene
and ethylene-based feedstocks and derivatives, while Tanjung Langsat will be
the centre for naptha-based petrochemical industries. In addition, investments
for the production of petrochemical products will also be made in other locations,
such as Pasir Gudang, Melaka, Prai and Shah Alam.
Coal
11.56 To meet the objective of the fuel diversification policy, three coal-fired
power plants at Kapar, Manjung and Lukut will be commissioned during the Plan
period. These plants will utilize 11.2 million tonnes of coal per annum. Cleancoal technology which will include among others, electrostatic precipitators and
flue gas de-sulphurization for emission control, will be utilized in these new
plants to ensure environmental standards are met.
Electricity
11.57 Demand for electricity is expected to remain robust during the Plan
period, spurred by strong growth in most sectors of the economy. Concerted
efforts will be focused towards ensuring the availability of sufficient, secure and
reliable supply of electricity. The IPPs will increasingly assume a larger share
in generation, while the utilities continue to focus on improving transmission
and distribution networks. The industry will continue to undertake measures to
further improve its productivity and efficiency.
11.58 Generation. An additional 8,800 MW of generation capacity will be
commissioned during the Plan period, most of which will be installed by the IPPs
in Peninsular Malaysia, as shown in Table 11-5. These include the gas-fired
plants of 1,500 MW in Port Dickson, 640 MW in Lumut, 720 MW in Telok Gong,
220 MW in Pasir Gudang and 710 MW in Sepang. Although the three coal-fired
plants in Peninsular Malaysia have a total capacity of 5,100 MW, only 3,800 MW
is expected to be commissioned during the Plan period.
11.59 The implementation of the 2,400 MW Bakun Hydroelectric Project will
continue during the Plan period. The electricity generated will be mainly utilized
to meet the long-term power requirements of Sarawak and Sabah. The completion
of this project will not only facilitate the integration of the electricity supply
systems of Sabah and Sarawak but also within Sabah. In addition, the project
provides the option of exporting electricity to neighbouring countries and this
will assist in the establishment of the ASEAN Power Grid connecting Malaysia
with Brunei, Indonesia and the Philippines.332
11.60 Transmission. The transmission systems in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah
and Sarawak will be further strengthened to enhance reliability and efficiency.
During the Plan period, a 500 kV transmission project will be completed, which
will link the Manjung power station to Ayer Tawar. In Sabah, 275 kV transmission
lines of the west coast grid extension project from Kota Kinabalu to Kudat
involving a distance of 400 cct-km will be completed and work will commence
on the east-west inter-connection from Kota Kinabalu to Sandakan covering a
distance of 600 cct-km. In Sarawak, work relating to the upgrading of the
transmission system is also expected to commence with the revival of the Bakun
Hydroelectric Project.
11.61 Distribution. The distribution network in Peninsular Malaysia will be
expanded by almost two-fold to 356,900 cct-km, as shown in Table 11-9. In
addition, 133 new main intake substations and 185 main distribution substations
will be constructed and commissioned for the primary pupose of injecting additional
capacity to meet the projected demand growth as well as enhancing network
security, power quality and voltage conversion for specific distribution systems.
The SESCo system will also be upgraded to a total capacity of 8,370 cct-km with
the addition of 617 cct-km to the distribution network and 33 kV substations to
improve coverage, reliability and customer services. Similarly, with the
implementation of the east-west inter-connection and the west coast grid extension
projects, Sabah’s distribution network will also be upgraded and expanded by
an additional 2,789 cct-km.
11.62 Rural electrification. Rural electrification programmes, especially in Sabah
and Sarawak, will be enhanced during the Plan period. These involve grid
extension and the provision of stand-alone system generators comprising solar
photovoltaic, mini-hydro and hybrid systems. A total of RM856.6 million will
be allocated by the Federal Government for rural electrification programmes,
which are expected to benefit 103,126 rural households. In Peninsular Malaysia
and Sabah, rural electrification programmes will also be partly financed through
their respective electricity supply industry trust funds. Electricity coverage for
Sabah is expected to increase to 85 per cent, while that of Sarawak will reach
90 per cent by the end of the Plan period, as shown in Table 11-10. In Peninsular
Malaysia where universal coverage has been achieved, improvements will continue
to be made to extend the duration of supply in remote areas.
11.63 Industry Restructuring. The restructuring of the electricity supply industry
will be continued during the Plan period. However, a gradual approach will be
adopted in introducing a market mechanism in order to attract investments as333 Malaysia Plan Ma
laysia Plan Malay

well as ensure an adequate and reliable supply of electricity. This will involve
the establishment of an appropriate infrastructure and regulatory framework. An
independent entity will be incorporated to initially assist the Government in
system planning for the industry. In addition, an Energy Commission with the
responsibility covering both the technical and economic regulation of the
industry will be established to replace the Department of Electricity and Gas
Supply.
Renewable Energy
11.64 Utilization of RE as the fifth fuel will be intensified during the Plan
period to supplement the supply from conventional energy sources. RE resources
that will be promoted in terms of priority, are biomass, biogas, municipal waste,
solar and mini-hydro. Of these, biomass resources, such as oil palm and wood
residues as well as rice husks, will be used on a wider basis for the purpose of
heat and electricity generation.
11.65 Biomass-based co-generation system for the production of electricity and
usable energy will be encouraged. In this respect, the generation of energy
mainly for in-house consumption will be promoted. The supply of excess energy
generated by the biomass-based generating system to the local community
and to the grid will be considered, depending on its technical and commercial
viability.
11.66 In promoting greater utilization of RE resources, initiatives that will be
considered include demonstration projects and commercialization of research
findings as well as extension of financial and fiscal incentives for RE-related
activities. Under the Budget 2001, biomass-based generating companies that
apply for incentives by 31 December 2002 will be granted exemption of income
tax on 70 per cent of the statutory income for five years or a tax allowance of
60 per cent of qualifying capital expenditure incurred within five years. The
allowance can be utilized to set off up to 70 per cent of the statutory income.
In addition, import duty and sales tax exemption on machinery and equipment
that are not produced locally will also be granted. Co-operation between government
agencies and private institutions in the development of RE resources will also
be promoted.334
Energy Efficiency
11.67 During the Plan period, the implementation of EE programmes will focus
on the industrial and commercial sectors being the major consumers of energy.
Measures to promote the efficient utilization of energy include the enforcement
of the Energy Efficiency Regulation, extension of financial and fiscal incentives
and demonstration projects. In this respect, the establishment of new integrated
complexes and townships that are managed on an energy-efficient manner will
be encouraged. The implementation of demand-side management will be intensified
during the Plan period, which includes retrofitting and district cooling programmes,
changing the energy usage pattern and appliance labelling.
Development of Energy-related Industries and Services
11.68 In developing energy-related industries and services, various initiatives
will be considered including the assessment of the capabilities of local companies,
prioritization of potential areas that local companies could participate and provision
of organizational support. Operation and maintenance, contract management,
refurbishment, testing laboratories and services, manufacture of auxiliary equipments
as well as RE technologies related to bio-mass, will be further developed as
strategic niches. Besides increasing the participation of local companies, these
efforts will also contribute towards enhancing manpower development for the
energy sector. This will be in line with the promotion of the export of energyrelated products and services by Malaysian entities and Malaysia as a regional
centre for energy-related engineering services.
Research and Development
11.69 R&D programmes are important to encourage the usage of alternative
sources of energy as well as promote efficient and safe utilization of energy
resources. In this regard, methyl ester from palm oil, also known as palm diesel,
has been identified as a viable potential fuel for the transport sector. Research
efforts show that no modification of engines is required and fuel consumption
of palm diesel by engines is comparable to petroleum diesel. In addition, palm
diesel is technically superior to petroleum diesel in terms of ignition and engine
performance as well as lower emission of hydrocarbon and toxic gases. Other
alternative sources of energy that will be considered include fuel cell, hybrid cell
and hydrogen fuel. Pusat Tenaga Malaysia will continue its role in co-ordinating
and managing energy-related R&D programmes.335 Malaysia Plan Ma
