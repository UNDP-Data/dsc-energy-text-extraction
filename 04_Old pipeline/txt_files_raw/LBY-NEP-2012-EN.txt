 Propose the legislation needed to support renewable energy.
Implementation of the programs related to the energy efficiency
Renewable Energy Authority of Libya
(REAoL)Mission
Work toward integrating the locally
available Renewable energy Resources
(Solar & Wind) with the National Energy
System.
Increase the share of RE in the National
Energy Mix.Vision
Our vision is to become a leading
company with its achievements and

Progress developmentShort-term projects (2013 – 2015)
 Mature, well proven technologies and do not constitute a
significant burden on the public budget during this period.
 The state should invest in this strategic sector with the aim
of transferring knowledge and technology localization and
building national technical staff.
 Most short-term plan projects financed from the Country
budget due to the absence of laws and legislation governing
investment in this sector.

Proposed national strategy for the development of RE in Libya 
(2013 – 2025) Saving 2.9 million barrels of oil per year
 avoid about one million tons of carbon dioxide annually.
 Financial returns from the sale of certificates reduction in carbon
emissions valued at about (6 – 8 million US Dollars annually)
 Contribute to cover part of the demand for electric power
 Gain experience and transfer of knowledge and technology
localization.
 Sustainable spatial development and job creation
 Will pave the way toward having Libya as a clean energy exporter
Indicators that can be achieved from the implementation of the short term 
projects 92013 – 2015)
Implementation of this program will be place Libya at the forefront on the regional

8. The Energy Efficiency
Contents:REAOL has been officially given the job of carrying out the 
work of Energy Efficiency to the stage of implementation:• Coming up with the National Energy Efficiency Action 
Plan (NEEAP)
• Review the worldwide practices of EE and come up 
with the best practices and what, how, when can be 
implemented in Libya
• Propose the necessary laws, regulations, incentives 
and get it approved by the Government.
• Do the work of public awareness and public 
acceptance.

The proposed structure of NEEAP National 
Plan of Energy Efficiency With the end of 2014, we expected the plan has
reached the stage of going into force.
By that time we expect to have laws, regulations
and policies and legislation and incentives
approved by the Government.
By that, we need to create a supervisory authority
to ensure compliance with the laws and
regulations …. RegulatorWords to Conclude:
To see the fruitful conclusions of this RE & EE action 
plan, the following must be considered:
Libya’s electricity market up to now is a complete 
monopoly. GECOL is the only generation company, only 
transmission company, only distribution company …. Heavily 
subsidized.
The price of electricity in Libya is very low. A fair and 
practical FiT must be in place.
Libya has no energy regulator.Words to Conclude:
To see the fruitful conclusions of this RE & EE action 
plan, the following must be considered:
Investment laws in the energy sector does not exist.
The energy market in Libya is very much fragmented and 
not easy come up with risk assessment.
Libya (REAOL) must create a power purchase agreement 
to promote the various RE technologies (cost + profit 
margin).Words to Conclude:
To see the fruitful conclusions of this RE & EE action 
plan, the following must be considered:
 The Libyan financial institutions must get involved in the
investment.
 Directing a percentage of current support for
conventional energy sources (fuels of various kinds) to
support the development of renewable energy sources
 Libya must play a role toward the implementation of the
proposed international initiatives.
 Increase the R & D support for RE and EE The Libyan financial institutions must get involved in
the investment.
 Directing a percentage of current support for
conventional energy sources (fuels of various kinds) to
support the development of renewable energy sources
 Libya must play a role toward the implementation of the
proposed international initiatives.
 Increase the R & D support for RE and EEThank You1. Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency

3. Euro-Mediterranean Energy Market Integration Project 
(MED EMIP)
For these bodies a essential role in reviewing and evaluating the
plan (in the case of the request of the Country). As well as review
and redirect the application every three years.
Competent technical parties worked with Secretariat 
of the Council of Arab electricity ministers In the 
preparation of form the indicative1. Study the possibility of using silicon available in Libya in the solar cell industry.
2. Planning to establish an industrial base for renewable energy equipment in Libya
3. Study the possibilities available to the local entry in the industrial partnerships
4. Reload National Atlas of the Solar and Wind Energy.
5. Study and evaluate the performance of renewable energy systems installed
