(ASEAN) in terms of energy consumption. Across the country’s more than 
17,000 islands, energy demand is growing rapidly.
Although reliance on domestic coal, as well as imported petroleum products, 
has increased in recent years, Indonesia has started adding more renewable 
capacity to its energy mix. The country aims to achieve 23% renewable energy 
use by 2025, and 31% by 2050, as part of its plans to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions in line with the objectives of the Paris climate agreement.
Along with some of the world’s greatest geothermal and hydropower potential, Indonesia also possesses abundant 
resources for solar, wind, ocean and bioenergy development. In addition to power generation, these sources could 
support heating, cooling and transport applications.
To help countries like Indonesia harness this potential, REmap – the global roadmap from the International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) – presents a range of technology and resource options, as well as key insights 
on the opportunities and challenges ahead.
As this REmap country study shows, Indonesia’s renewable energy target for 2050 could be achieved as soon as 
2030, given the right policies and investments starting today. Beyond power generation, energy end-uses require 
closer attention for the full potential of renewables to be achieved. At the same time, a sustainable supply chain 
needs to be in place to support the expanding use of modern bioenergy.
The benefits of such accelerated uptake for Indonesia would greatly outweigh the costs. In economic terms, the net 
reduction of energy system costs, combined with the avoidance of air pollution and carbon-dioxide emissions, would 
save up to USD 53 billion per year, or an estimated 1.7% of Indonesia’s 2030 GDP.
But harnessing this potential requires over USD 16 billion of investments per year for the years between 2015 and 
2030, from modest levels at present. Recent market developments suggest that Indonesia is on the right path, with 
renewable energy investments already on the rise.
If Indonesia continues to follow this course, it can play a leading role, not only regionally but also internationally, in 
the advancement of the global energy transition. IRENA stands ready to work closely with Indonesia as the country 
strives for a sustainable energy future.

VRE variable renewable energyEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Rapid growth in energy consumption
Indonesia is among the world’s fastest growing countries in terms of energy consumption. This is fuelled 
by robust economic development, increasing urbanisation and steady population growth. The country is 
the largest energy user in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), accounting for nearly 40% 
of total energy use among ASEAN members. Between 2000 and 2014, energy consumption in Indonesia 
increased by nearly 65%. In a business-as-usual outlook (the “Reference Case” in this study), it is set to grow 
another 80% by 2030. Indonesia is therefore crucial to a renewable energy transition for the region as a 
whole.
Indonesia’s electricity consumption will more than triple by 2030. Economic growth means rising use of 
electricity for cookers, fans, air conditioning and other appliances. At the same time, Indonesia is expanding 
electricity access in remote areas and islands. More than 10% of the country’s population still lacks access to 
electricity, but the government is aiming for near-100% electrification by 2026.
Transport and industry show the fastest expected growth in energy use. For both sectors, energy 
consumption is expected to more than double between today and 2030. About 1 million motor vehicles 
and 7.5 million motorcycles and scooters are added to Indonesia’s roads every year, further exacerbating 
the already severe air pollution in urban centres. Industrial energy use is expanding in line with economic 
growth, with large industries such as cement, aluminium, paper and ceramics accounting for a majority of 
the increase.

Buildings Transport Industry OtherSustainability concerns amid a changing energy supply mix
The use of coal is rising to meet domestic growth in energy demand. At the turn of this century, only about 
10% of Indonesia’s energy needs were met by coal. Currently, coal accounts for almost one-third of the energy 
supply. This rapid expansion is an outcome of government policy aimed at meeting high growth in energy 
demand while reducing imports of petroleum products. Indonesia is the fourth largest producer of coal 
worldwide and was the largest exporter in 2014. Coal increasingly is consumed domestically amid stagnant 
domestic production of natural gas and oil. Based on the Reference Case, the use of coal would more than 
double by 2030 from today’s levels. This not only would mean additional greenhouse gas emissions from coal 
combustion, but it also would exacerbate air pollution and issues related to water contamination and scarcity.
Traditional uses of bioenergy dominate renewable energy use in Indonesia. A majority of renewable 
energy use in Indonesia is represented by traditional uses of bioenergy (mainly for cooking) in the country’s 
rural areas and remote islands. Although the share of traditional bioenergy uses in the energy supply mix 
has declined, an estimated 24.5 million households (40% of all households) still rely primarily on fuelwood 
for cooking. This practice results in indoor air pollution which is associated with 165 000 premature deaths in 
Indonesia per year. In the Reference Case, mainly through the uptake of electricity and liquefied petroleum 
gas (LPG) for cooking, the number of houses relying on fuelwood would drop to about 8 million by 2030.
Liquid biofuel blending mandates – while advancing the transition to renewable energy sources – come 
with supply side challenges. Especially for transport, there is a strong projected increase in the use of liquid 
biofuels as a result of mandated biodiesel (B30) and ethanol (E20) blending from 2025 onwards. Total liquid 
biofuel use per year is projected to increase to 25 billion litres by 2030, compared to 1.35 billion litres of 
biodiesel that was blended in the first half of 2016. Today, biodiesel in Indonesia is produced from palm oil, a 
crop for which the government recently renewed a moratorium to prevent additional plantations.

Bioenergy (traditional uses) Bioenergy (modern uses) Geothermal
Hydropower Other renewablesAiming for an affordable, secure and sustainable energy system
Indonesia already has ambitious targets to increase its use of renewable energy. The country has set 
an overall target to have modern renewables (excluding traditional uses of bioenergy) provide 23% of total 
primary energy supply (TPES) by 2025, and 31% by 2050. The Reference Case, which assumes that these 
targets are met, implies a share for renewable energy of 17% in total final energy consumption (TFEC) by 
2030, up from about 6% today.
Indonesia could achieve its 2050 renewable energy targets two decades sooner. The International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has worked with Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources 
(MEMR) to develop a roadmap to 2030, highlighting ways to increase the uptake of renewable energy beyond 
the country’s present policies and plans. Across sectors and technologies, the additional potentials (“REmap 
Options” in this study) increase the share of renewable energy to 23% of TFEC – or 31% of TPES – by 2030.
Renewable energy use will continue to be highest in power generation. In the Reference Case, the share of 
renewable energy in power generation would increase to 29% by 2030. To assess the potential for additional 
renewable power in Indonesia, five regions (Java-Bali, Kalimantan, Maluku & Papua, Sulawesi & Nusa 
Tenggara and Sumatra) were distinguished, and for each, the renewable resource potential and projected 
power demand in 2030 was analysed. Based on this assessment, the share of renewable energy in power 
generation increases to 38% by 2030 with the REmap Options.
Solar photovoltaics (PV) offers much greater potential than current plans for the power sector reflect.
The REmap Options for hydropower, geothermal, bioenergy and wind power are modest, given their 
ambitious increase in the Reference Case and the geographical mismatch in resource potential and power 
demand. For solar PV, however, REmap identifies potential for 47 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity by 
2030, compared to just over 9 GW in the Reference Case. This includes plans to use solar PV to provide 
electricity to nearly 1.1 million households in remote areas that currently lack adequate access to electricity. 
Especially in Java-Bali (which accounts for 70% of power demand in Indonesia) there is enough available 
space, good infrastructure and additional need for power to greatly increase both rooftop and utility-scale 
solar PV installations.

/yearNext to power generation, Indonesia’s greatest renewable energy use will be in buildings. Including the 
contribution of renewable electricity, the share of renewable energy in TFEC in buildings increases to 37% in 
2030, compared to 18% in the Reference Case. With REmap, households that would rely on traditional uses 
of bioenergy for cooking in the Reference Case switch to modern cook stoves that use mostly solid biomass, 
and to some extent ethanol. Based on an assessment of available rooftop space and realistic deployment 
potential, solar thermal collectors supply 30% of energy used for water heating, while solar (thermal) cooling 
meets 5% of energy demand for cooling in buildings.
Industry will make much greater use of bioenergy and also could scale up solar thermal systems to 
supply process heat. Through the assessment of the projected energy use in key industry sectors and the 
supply potential of different types of feedstock, the REmap Options identify potential for an additional 216 
petajoules (PJ) per year of bioenergy use in industry beyond the Reference Case. This consists of more use of 
biogas (from food waste and palm oil mill effluent), wood residues and waste. Combined with the identified 
potential of 70 PJ per year for solar thermal collectors to supply process heat (in the rubber, food and textile 
industries), the share of renewable energy in industry TFEC increases to 21% by 2030, compared to 15% by 
2030 in the Reference Case and 12% in 2014.
Bioenergy will continue to play an important role in the use of renewables in Indonesia. With REmap, 
more than half of all renewable energy use in Indonesia in 2030 would be in the form of bioenergy used 
for process heat in industry or as liquid biofuels in transport. Solar applications (including PV and thermal) 
account for 15% of renewable energy use in all sectors in Indonesia as envisaged by REmap, followed by 
hydropower (14%) and geothermal power (9%).

24%Indonesia could have 3 million electric four-wheeled vehicles and 42.5 million electric two- and 
three-wheelers on the road by 2030. Given the high increase in the use of liquid biofuel in transport in the 
Reference Case and the associated supply-side constraints, the REmap Options in transport focus on electric 
mobility. With the continued increase in vehicle ownership, nearly 6% of all four-wheeled vehicles (consisting 
mainly of electric cars) and 20% of two- and three-wheelers would be electric by 2030. Combined, they 
increase the share of renewable energy in transport TFEC to 18%, from about 3% today.
Benefits of renewable energy greatly outweigh costs
Higher renewable energy uptake would reduce the total costs of the energy system. Based on a 
comparison of the cost of the REmap Options and the conventional fuels which they replace, the savings to 
the energy system in 2030 is estimated at USD 1.7 billion per year. This is from a government perspective, 
which excludes subsidies on energy prices and applies a discount rate of 10%. With a market discount rate 
of 12% and including energy subsidies, the additional costs to the energy system are USD 1.1 billion per year. 
This shows the importance of further removing energy subsidies, such as on prices for electricity and selected 
petroleum products, as well as of lowering the cost of capital for renewable energy projects.
Renewable energy can strengthen Indonesia’s energy security while greatly reducing emissions. The 
REmap Options reduce demand for fossil fuels by 10% relative to the Reference Case. The impact is the 
largest for coal (-17%) and oil (-9%) and thus would contribute to reducing imports of petroleum products, 
which have increased in recent years. The reduction in the use of coal, which is projected to increase in most 
ASEAN countries, contributes strongly to avoided carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions with REmap, which are 
150 million tonnes (Mt) per year lower than with the Reference Case.
Indonesia needs to focus more on energy efficiency and on non-energy emissions in order to achieve 
its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in the global effort to address climate change. Indonesia’s 
NDC aims for a 29% (unconditional) reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to a 
business-as-usual scenario. The REmap Options would account for about half of the targeted energyrelated reductions. However, the business-as-usual scenario used to determine the NDC can be considered 
conservative, as it does not include any renewable energy deployment or energy efficiency improvements. 
Furthermore, forestry accounts for more than half of Indonesia’s overall targeted unconditional reductions. 
Therefore, reducing emissions through further energy efficiency improvements and in other sectors – 
particularly from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) – will be crucial as well.
Scaling up renewables can save Indonesia between USD 15.6 billion and USD 51.7 billion per year when 
the impacts on air pollution and climate change are included. With REmap, the avoidance of premature 
deaths and the savings that come with reduced health costs from reductions in outdoor air pollution are 
valued at USD 3.0 billion to USD 9.7 billion per year. Reduced externalities from indoor air pollution account 
for another USD 10.4 billion to USD 31.3 billion per year, due to the substitution of traditional uses of 
bioenergy for cooking. As said, the REmap Options also would lead to a reduction of 150 Mt of CO2 emissions 
per year which, with a carbon price of USD 17 to USD 80 per tonne equates to savings of USD 2.2 billion to 
USD 10.7 billion per year in 2030. The reduced system costs and externality savings equal 0.5% to 1.7% of 
Indonesia’s forecasted gross domestic product in 2030.
Greater renewable energy deployment will create more jobs and stimulate technology transfer. Earlier 
IRENA work has indicated the potential for 1.3 million jobs in the renewable energy sector in Indonesia by 
2030, up from just over 100 000 today. Scaling up the market for renewable energy technologies provides 
significant opportunities for localising parts of the value chain, such as through local manufacture of solar 
panels and electric vehicles, with the associated technology transfer having the potential to come with 
additional positive effects to the economy.Investments in renewable energy need to accelerate rapidly in Indonesia. Annual investment in renewable 
energy capacity in the Reference Case is estimated at, on average, USD 9.4 billion in 2015-2030. With the 
REmap Options this would increase to USD 16.2 billion. The power sector accounts for USD 13.2 billion, nearly 
half of which is for solar PV. Given the modest level of investments today, a rapid acceleration is required for 
Indonesia to capture its renewable energy potential.
Challenges in accelerating renewable energy deployment
For Indonesia to accelerate its uptake of renewable energy, several challenges have to be addressed. These 
challenges are different for the power sector and for the energy end-use sectors of transport, buildings and 
industry. Bioenergy, given its cross-cutting application across sectors and technologies, warrants its own 
assessment.
In the power sector, several broad barriers are evident, along with technology-specific challenges:
● Grid integration of variable renewable energy (VRE) might come with challenges given the highly 
fragmented nature of Indonesia’s grid, with many small grids in remote locations;
● For off-grid areas there is a lack of bankable off-takers, the risk of inadequate system design, and 
operational issues due to the insufficient operation and maintenance (O&M) of systems;
● Cost recovery for PLN (the national utility) remains an issue as feed-in tariffs for renewable energy 
generally exceed the price that PLN charges to consumers of electricity; however, a recent Ministerial 
Degree will affect feed-in tariff pricing and limit renewable energy tariffs to between 85% and 100% 
of PLN’s regional production price;
● Project finance opportunities for renewable energy projects in Indonesia are limited at present, as local 
banks do not allocate sufficient resources to this segment;
● Land acquisition issues are common due to a lack of clarity regarding land ownership in many 
locations, while the process for acquiring land is often costly and time consuming;
● Technology-specific challenges (e.g., for solar PV, wind, etc.) include a lack of awareness of solutions, 
the need to build local capacity, a lack of streamlined permitting and regulatory frameworks, and the 
absence of detailed resource assessments.
In the end-use sectors, Indonesia needs to address key challenges as well:
● Solar thermal for water heating and cooling in buildings has great potential; however, limited 
awareness of solutions and a lack of design standards are holding back the market;
● Limited awareness in industry of the potential for solar collectors to supply process heat and their 
intermittent supply of energy pose barriers, as well as space limitations which might be an issue for 
existing plants;
● The focus for renewable energy in transport is on liquid biofuels, whereas electric mobility remains 
largely unaddressed. A lack of infrastructure and regulatory frameworks is holding back the identified 
potential for electric four-wheeled vehicles and two-and-three wheelers.
Challenges can arise for bioenergy on both the supply and demand sides. Concerns about the 
sustainability of supply, despite the potential of yield improvements and the use of degraded lands, pose a 
challenge to Indonesia’s targets for liquid biofuel blending. In industry, the potential of using residues and 
waste comes with the challenges of high transportation cost, seasonality of feedstock supply, the lack of a 
local grid to interconnect (power) projects, and competition for the feedstock with other uses (e.g., the use 
of trunks and leaves to replenish soil). The accelerated use of modern cook stoves – using solid biomass and 
ethanol instead of traditional uses of bioenergy for cooking – is challenged by limited awareness and high 
required upfront investment.Areas for action
Various solutions are available to promote higher uptake of renewable energy in Indonesia. These can be 
grouped into three main areas for action:
1. Intensify efforts to meet the growing demand for electricity by capturing the full potential of 
Indonesia’s vast renewable energy resources.
Indonesia is endowed with phenomenal resources for renewable power generation. To capture the country’s 
potential and address the existing challenges, Indonesia’s policy makers and energy decision makers are 
encouraged to:
Ø Align the targets for renewable energy deployment among different stakeholders and incorporate the 
expected deployment of VRE in transmission and distribution plans. Consider using energy storage to 
smooth integration of VRE and introduce priority dispatch for renewable energy generation.
Ø Identify funds that can cover the gap between renewable energy power purchase agreements 
(PPAs) and the revenues that PLN receives from consumers. The process for PLN to negotiate PPAs 
directly with developers for projects should be more standardised and should include more detailed 
requirements.
Ø Establish larger off-grid working areas encompassing multiple villages to achieve economies of scale 
for off-grid solutions, and consider expanding PLN’s responsibilities to build and own distribution 
networks in off-grid locations to further reduce the cost to off-grid solution providers. Create an entity 
responsible for overseeing O&M of mini-grid systems – involving local communities – and expand the 
use of standardised survey methodologies to ensure that systems are scaled adequately.
Ø Increase awareness of opportunities among commercial banks and send clear signals that renewables 
will receive long-term, stable policy support. Create standard procedures and performance indicators 
for project development documents.
Ø Involve local communities early in the project development phase and consider providing additional 
services from projects (such as providing electricity) to communities. Large regional differences in the 
cost of land should be reflected more in feed-in tariffs, and the government could take a more active 
role in providing lands for projects.
Ø Address other barriers specific to each of the renewable power technologies – which consist mainly of 
increasing awareness and local capacity building and maximising local value; streamlining permitting 
and regulatory frameworks; and expanding resource assessments.
2. Increase the focus on renewable energy opportunities in industry, buildings and transport.
To fully capture the potential of renewable energy to reduce emissions and air pollution, more attention to 
these end-use sectors is recommended. Here, Indonesia has several options:
Ø Consider requirements for solar water heater installations in building codes and demonstration 
projects for solar cooling technologies.
Ø Highlight the potential for solar thermal energy to substitute for petroleum products, for example 
through local demonstration projects. Consider solar thermal storage capacity and/or hybrid solutions 
in the design and construction of new industrial plants.
Ø Combine infrastructure investments (such as charging infrastructure at large parking lots in cities) with 
support policies (e.g., tax exemptions) to expand the market for electric vehicles and electric two- and 
three-wheelers. Electric mobility, when powered by renewable energy, could play an important role in 
reducing air pollution in cities and in reducing the reliance on liquid fuels in transport. Policy support 
for electric mobility is crucial given the immaturity of the market in Indonesia and the relatively high 
cost compared to conventional cars and electric two- and three-wheelers.3. Develop an integrated and comprehensive bioenergy programme that captures Indonesia’s 
potential and ensures its use in a sustainable manner.
Indonesia’s abundant resources for bioenergy can be used in multiple applications spanning all economic 
sectors. The detailed recommendations provided in the report include this key suggestion:
Ø Develop a comprehensive bioenergy programme with the objective of maximising the sustainable use 
of the local resource through gradually increasing targets across sectors. Innovative approaches and 
technologies on both the supply side and demand side should be included, while the sustainability of 
bioenergy use in Indonesia should be safeguarded. Solutions with a high impact and low cost should 
be prioritised. One example is increasing the use of biogas produced from palm oil mill effluent, which 
not only was found to be a cost-competitive option, but also avoids methane emissions that occur 
when the biogas is not used. The efforts of the Indonesia Clean Stove Initiative and the Indonesia 
Domestic Biogas Programme also should be expanded to advance the dissemination of modern cook 
stoves based on bioenergy.1.1 IRENA’s REmap programme
The REmap programme aims to pave the way to 
promoting accelerated renewable energy development 
through a series of activities including global, regional 
and country studies. REmap analysis and activity also 
informs IRENA publications on specific renewable 
technologies or energy sectors.
The REmap programme collaborates closely with 
governmental bodies and other institutions which are 
responsible for energy planning and renewable energy 
development. The analysis relies on broad consultations 
with energy experts and stakeholders from numerous 
countries around the world.
At its inception, REmap emerged as IRENA’s proposal 
for a pathway to support the United Nations Sustainable 
Energy for All initiative in its objective to double the 
global share of renewable energy from 18% in 2010 to 
36% by 2030 (UN and World Bank, 2016). Since then, 
the Paris Agreement was adopted at COP21 in 2015 
with a target of minimising the earth’s temperature 
increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (°C) by 2050. The 
widespread development of renewables is a critical 
lever to fulfilling this objective.
To double the renewable energy share across the world, 
REmap takes a bottom-up approach. Country-level 
assessments are carried out to determine the potential 
contributions that each country could make to the 
overall renewable energy share. The first global REmap 
report, published in 2014, included a detailed analysis 
of 26 major energy-consuming countries representing 
around 75% of global energy demand. The REmap 
programme has since expanded to 40 countries 
accounting for 80% of world energy use.
The REmap evaluation of the national plans of 
40  countries (which could be considered the 
business-as-usual case) suggests that under current 
conditions and policy approaches, the global share of 
renewables increases to only 21%. This indicates a 15 
percentage-point shortfall in relation to the target to 
double the global renewables share by 2030 (IRENA, 
2016a). Indonesia’s role will be crucial to accelerate 
broader regional renewable energy deployment, given 
that it is the largest energy user in the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)1.
In 2015, Indonesia set a target for the country to realise 
23% of primary energy supply from modern renewable 
energy by 2025, as part of a collective target set by 
ASEAN member states. Because Indonesia is the largest 
country in ASEAN, understanding the role of renewables 
to meet the country’s growing energy demand is key for 
the region. With a population of more than 250 million 
spread out over more than 17 000 islands, Indonesia 
faces challenges today in matching energy demand 
and supply. The largest demand centres are Java 
and Sumatra in the west, whereas the main energy 
resources are in Kalimantan and the eastern provinces. 
Electrification is on the rise in Indonesia, from 65% in 
2008 to 80.5% in 2013. However, large differences exist 
across the country, from less than 40% electrification 
in Papua to close to 100% in Jakarta. Indonesia’s state 
utility company PLN (Perusahaan Listrik Negara) aims 
for 98% electrification by 2022.
While plans exist to expand interconnection, transmission 
bottlenecks and isolated areas remain constraints to 
optimising Indonesia’s energy system and the role of 
renewables therein. Ambitious fuel support schemes 
and mandates were introduced in the transport sector, 
but results are falling short of ambitions. With energy 
demand increasing rapidly, expanding the share of 
modern renewable energy will be challenging given the 
country’s infrastructure constraints and its decreasing 
reliance on traditional biomass. However, the drivers 
are clear: positive impacts in terms of socio-economics, 
public health, and the environment, as well as energy

1 THE REMAP PROGRAMME AND REMAP 
INDONESIAsecurity and technology development, all support an 
increase in the use of renewables in Indonesia.
In January 2016, Indonesia approached the International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to start a 
collaboration in preparation of a specific renewable 
energy roadmap (REmap) report for the country, 
with the desire to develop a practical roadmap that 
clearly identifies technology potentials and shows 
how implementation gaps can be closed for Indonesia 
to reach its renewable energy ambitions. IRENA’s 
REmap work assesses the potential, costs and benefits 
of renewables beyond national targets and plans of 
countries at a sector level. REmap is based on close 
co-operation and consultation with country experts 
nominated by each government. It does not investigate 
multiple scenarios for the future, but instead focuses on 
technology options.
Indonesia has been a part of the REmap programme 
since 2013, and the work that was completed prior 
to the current study was used as a starting point 
for the present REmap Indonesia report. For REmap 
Indonesia, the government highlighted a particular 
interest in the following topics: empowering renewables 
in isolated settings (given the island structure of 
Indonesia), integrating variable renewable energy 
(VRE) generation and ensuing grid limitations, the 
potential and approach for utilising renewables in enduse sectors, and the opportunities for expanding the 
use of biofuels. The overall objective is to identify 
how Indonesia can achieve its ambitions for increasing 
the share of modern renewables. Costs, benefits and 
potentials per technology on a sectoral level, and clear 
policy recommendations and focus areas for Indonesia 
are provided.
1.2 The REmap approach
This section explains the REmap methodology and 
summarises the background data used for the Indonesia 
analysis. The annexes provide more detailed information.
REmap is a roadmap of technology options to increase 
the global share of renewables. It involves a bottomup, iterative analysis. By March 2016, IRENA’s REmap 
programme had assessed the potential for renewables 
in 2030 of 40 countries, which would account for 80% 
of total global energy demand. These are: Argentina, 
Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, 
Cyprus, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, 
Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, 
Iran, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Poland, the Republic of 
Korea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South 
Africa, Sweden, Tonga, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Arab 
Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States and 
Uruguay.
REmap identifies the realistic potential for accelerating 
renewable energy deployment. This can be fulfilled with 
existing technologies and is economically practical and 
achievable by 2030.
The REmap analysis starts by building the energy 
balance of a country, using 2010 as the base year of 
the analysis, based on national data and statistics. To 
the extent that data availability allows, information for 
more recent years (in the case of Indonesia, for 2014) is 
provided where relevant. The country then provides its 
latest national energy plans and targets for renewables 
and fossil fuels, collated to produce a business-asusual perspective of the energy system, referred to as 
the Reference Case. This includes total final energy 
consumption (TFEC) for each end-use sector (buildings, 
industry and transport) and distinguishes between 
power, district heating and direct uses of energy with a 
breakdown by energy carrier for the period 2010-2030.
Once the Reference Case is ready, the additional 
renewable energy potential by technology is investigated 
for each sector. The potential of these technologies is 
described as REmap Options2. Each REmap Option 
replaces a non-renewable energy technology3 to deliver 
the same energy service. The resulting case when all of 
these options are aggregated is called REmap.
Throughout this study, the renewable energy share 
is estimated in relation to TFEC4. Modern renewable 
2 An approach based on options rather than scenarios is deliberate. 
REmap is an exploratory study and not a target-setting exercise.
3 Non-renewable technologies encompass fossil fuels, nonsustainable uses of bioenergy (referred to here as traditional 
bioenergy) and nuclear power. As a supplement to this report’s 
annexes, a detailed list of these technologies and related 
background data are provided on the REmap website.
4 TFEC is the energy delivered to consumers as electricity, heat 
or fuels that can be used directly as a source of energy. This 
consumption is usually subdivided into transport, industry, 
residential, commercial and public buildings, and agriculture. It 
excludes non-energy uses of fuels.energy excludes traditional uses of bioenergy5. The 
share of modern renewable energy in TFEC is equal to 
total modern renewable energy consumption in end-use 
sectors (including consumption of renewable electricity 
and district heat, and direct uses of renewables), divided 
by TFEC. The share of renewables in power generation 
also is calculated. The renewable energy share also can 
be expressed in terms of the direct uses of renewables 
only. The renewable energy use by end-use sector 
covers the areas described below.
● Buildings include the residential, commercial 
and public sectors. Renewable energy is used in 
direct applications for heating, cooling or cooking 
purposes or as renewable electricity.
● Industry includes the manufacturing and mining 
sectors, in which renewable energy is consumed 
in direct-use applications (e.g., process heat or 
refrigeration) and electricity from renewable 
sources.
● Transport sector, which can make direct use of 
renewables through the consumption of liquid 
and gaseous biofuels or through electricity 
generated using renewable energy technologies.
Metrics for assessing REmap Options
To assess the costs of REmap Options, substitution 
costs are calculated. This report also discusses the 
costs and savings of renewable energy deployment 
and related externalities due to climate change and 
air pollution. Experts devised four main indicators: 
substitution costs, system costs, total investment 
needs and needs for renewable energy investment 
support.
Substitution costs
Each renewable and non-renewable technology has 
its own individual cost relative to the non-renewable 
energy that it replaces. This is explained in detail in the 
5 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
(FAO) defines traditional biomass use as woodfuels, agricultural 
by-products and dung burned for cooking and heating purposes 
(FAO, 2000). In developing countries, traditional biomass is still 
widely harvested and used in an unsustainable, inefficient and 
unsafe way. It is mostly traded informally and non-commercially. 
Modern biomass, by contrast, is produced in a sustainable manner 
from solid wastes and residues from agriculture and forestry and 
relies on more efficient methods (IEA and World Bank, 2015). 
For each REmap Option, the analysis considers the cost 
of substituting a non-renewable energy technology to 
deliver an identical amount of heat, electricity or energy 
service. The cost of each REmap Option is represented 
by its substitution cost6,7:
This indicator provides a comparable metric for all 
renewable energy technologies identified in each sector. 
Substitution costs are the key indicators for assessing 
the economic viability of REmap Options. They depend 
on the type of conventional technology substituted, 
energy prices and the characteristics of the REmap 
Option. The cost can be positive (additional) or negative 
(savings) because many renewable energy technologies 
are or could by 2030 be more cost-effective than 
conventional technologies.
System costs
On the basis of the substitution cost, inferences can be 
made as to the effect on system costs. This indicator is 
the sum of the differences between the total capital and 
operating expenditures of all energy technologies based 
on their deployment in REmap and the Reference Case 
in 2030.
6 Substitution cost is the difference between the annualised cost 
of the REmap Option and the annualised cost of the substituted 
non-renewable technology used to produce the same amount 
of energy. This is divided by the total renewable energy use 
substituted by the REmap Option.

Renewable energy investment support needs
Renewable energy investment support needs also 
can be approximated on the basis of the REmap tool. 
Total requirements for renewable investment support 
in all sectors are estimated as the difference in the 
delivered energy service cost (e.g., in USD per kWh or 
USD per GJ from a government perspective) for the 
renewable option against the dominant incumbent in 
2030. This difference is multiplied by the deployment 
for that option in that year to arrive at an investment 
support total for that technology. The differences for 
all REmap Options are added together to provide an 
annual investment support requirement for renewables.

Investment needs
Investment needs for renewable energy capacity 
also can be assessed. The total investment needs of 
technologies in REmap are higher than in the Reference 
Case due to the increased share of renewables. On 
average, these have greater investment needs than 
the non-renewable energy technology equivalent. 
The capital investment cost in USD per kilowatt (kW) 
of installed capacity in each year is multiplied with 
the deployment in that year to arrive at total annual 
investment costs. The capital investment costs of each 
year are then added up for the period 2016-2030. 
Net incremental investment needs are the sum of the 
differences between the total investment costs for all 
renewable and non-renewable energy technologies in 
power generation and stationary applications in REmap 
and the Reference Case in the period 2016-2030 for 
each year. This total was then turned into an annual 
average for the period.
Government and business perspectives
Based on the substitution cost and the potential of 
each REmap Option, country cost-supply curves are 
developed for 2030 from two perspectives: government
and business.
● Government perspective: cost estimates 
exclude energy taxes and subsidies. In the latest 
global REmap study (IRENA, 2016a), a standard 
discount rate of 10% (for non-OECD countries) 
or 7.5% (for OECD countries) was used. This 
approach allows a comparison across countries 
and a country cost-benefit analysis; it shows 
the cost of the transition as governments would 
calculate it.
● Business perspective: this considers national 
prices (including, for example, energy taxes, 
subsidies and the cost of capital) in order to 
generate a localised cost curve. This approach 
shows the cost of the transition as businesses or 
investors would calculate it. A discount rate of 
12% is assumed in the case of Indonesia.
By estimating the costs from two perspectives, the 
analysis shows the effects of accounting for energy 
taxes and subsidies while all other parameters are 
kept the same. An assessment of all additional costs 
related to complementary infrastructure (e.g., grid 
reinforcements, fuel stations) is excluded from this 
report. IRENA analysis suggests that these would be of 
secondary importance to countries only just embarking 
on their energy system transformation.
Externality analysis
Several externality reductions obtained through REmap 
Options are considered. They include health effects 
from outdoor or indoor exposure to pollution in the case of traditional bioenergy, as well as effects on agricultural 
yields. In addition, the external costs associated with the 
social and economic impacts of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
are estimated (IRENA, 2016a).
Further documentation and a detailed description 
of the REmap methodology can be found at 
www.irena.org/remap. Further details on metrics for 
assessing REmap Options can be consulted in the 
appendix of the 2016 global report (IRENA, 2016a).
1.3 Main sources of information 
and assumptions
The following key sources have been used to prepare 
the base year for the Indonesia analysis (2014), the 
Reference Case for 2030 and the REmap Options:
● Base year 2014: The starting point of the analysis 
is Indonesia’s energy balance for 2014. The 
data are based on the Handbook of Energy & 
Economic Statistics of Indonesia, as prepared by 
the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral 
Resources (MEMR, 2015). The same document 
and previous editions also are used to estimate 
historical trends in energy demand and supply.
● Reference Case: The Reference Case for 
Indonesia is based on three main sources:
— The National Energy Policy (KEN) scenario 
of the Energy Outlook Indonesia 2014 was 
used to generate a business-as-usual outlook 
for total final energy consumption and the 
breakdown of fuels consumed therein (MEMR, 
2014a).
— The National Electricity General Plan (RUKN) 
2015-2034 was used for the Reference Case 
for the power sector, whereby Indonesia was 
split into five regions: Java-Bali, Kalimantan, 
Maluku & Papua, Sulawesi & Nusa Tenggara 
and Sumatra (MEMR, 2016a). The revised KEN 
2025 targets for the various renewable power 
technologies were used to derive estimates 
for the installed power capacity for each by 
2030.
— Finally, as the RUKN power generation target 
for 2030 exceeds the power generation 
target that is included with the KEN scenario 
of the Energy Outlook Indonesia 2014, TFEC 
estimates from the latter were increased, 
reflecting higher growth in overall energy 
demand and a higher share of electricity in 
energy use.
● REmap: This is based on IRENA’s analysis 
combined with existing literature on Indonesia 
and information obtained through the REmap 
Indonesia kick-off workshop that was held in 
Jakarta on 1 April 2016. For the power sector the 
analysis for estimating the additional potentials 
for renewable generation and capacity are 
based on analysis of the above-mentioned five 
regions.
Finally, energy supply and demand numbers in this 
report generally are provided in petajoules (PJ) or 
exajoules (EJ), the standard for REmap. In Indonesia, 
commonly used units are tonnes of oil equivalent (toe). 
The relevant conversion factors are listed below:
● 1 GJ = 0.0238 toe
● 1 GJ = 277.78 kilowatt-hour (kWh)
● 1 PJ = 0.0238 million toe
● 1 PJ = 277.78 gigawatt-hour (GWh)
● 1 EJ = 23.88 million toe
● 1 EJ = 277.78 terawatt-hour (TWh)
This report is structured as follows: Chapter 2 introduces 
the overall energy and power sector context in Indonesia 
and presents the main renewable energy developments 
so far. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the current 
policy framework. Chapter 4 describes the renewable 
energy developments in the Reference Case. Chapter 5 
describes the potential and costs of renewable energy 
in Indonesia. Chapter 6 discusses the REmap Options, 
including their cost and benefits. Chapter 7 includes 
a discussion on the key barriers and opportunities in 
Indonesia to achieve the REmap Options. Chapter  8 
provides key recommendations for a larger renewable 
energy uptake.2. CURRENT SITUATION AND RECENT 
TRENDS
in recent years, could be reduced, increasing 
energy security. Finally, renewable energy can be 
used to increase energy access, mainly through 
the use of solar photovoltaics (PV) and smallscale hydropower in remote locations.
2.1 Indonesia’s energy system 
and recent developments in 
renewable energy
Energy consumption
Indonesia is the largest energy user in the ASEAN region, 
accounting for 38% of TFEC in 2013 (ACE, 2015a). Across 
more than 17 000 islands, TFEC in Indonesia amounted 
to 7.3 EJ in 2014 (excluding non-energy use), an increase 
of just over 20% since 2010 (MEMR, 2015). Longer 
term, the growth in energy consumption in Indonesia is 
closely related to economic growth (see figure 1).
More than half of all modern energy consumption 
(excluding traditional uses of bioenergy) in Indonesia 
takes place on Java, in line with the island’s share of the 
Indonesian population (see figure 2). Sumatra follows 
with one-quarter of energy consumption, and the other 
islands account for the remaining 19%.
Energy supply mix
Petroleum products (diesel, gasoline and liquefied 
petroleum gas – LPG) accounted for the largest share 
of TFEC in 2014, at 37% (or 2.7 EJ), down from 40% in 
2010 (see figure 3). The most important reason for the 
declining share is the increasing reliance on coal, due 
in part to a range of government policies over the past 
years in support of the domestic coal industry (EIA, 
2015). Coal use therefore showed the largest increase 
between 2010 and 2014: from 0.8 EJ or 14% of TFEC 
in 2010, to 1.4 EJ or 18% of TFEC in 2014. Bioenergy 
(including traditional uses) had the second largest 
share in TFEC in 2014, at close to 27 % (equivalent to 
Key points
● Indonesia accounts for nearly 40% of TFEC in the 
ASEAN region. Indonesia’s TFEC equalled 7.3 EJ 
in 2014 across the country’s more than 17 000 
islands. Across sectors and applications, energy 
use in Indonesia is growing rapidly. Between 2010 
and 2014, TFEC increased by more than 20%, 
while power generation increased by 35%. JavaBali accounts for more than half of TFEC today.
● Renewable energy use in Indonesia is dominated 
by bioenergy use in end-use sectors (industry, 
buildings and transport). Traditional uses 
of bioenergy (mainly for household cooking) 
account for 80% of total renewable energy 
use. Modern renewable energy use (excluding 
traditional uses of bioenergy) was 426 PJ in 2014, 
equivalent to 5.8% of TFEC. With traditional uses 
of bioenergy included, renewable energy use in 
2014 was 2 046 PJ or 28% of TFEC.
● Bioenergy use in industry represents the majority 
of modern renewable energy use in Indonesia 
today, at about 65% of the total, followed by 
the use of biodiesel in transportation (13%). 
Renewables in power generation contribute the 
remaining 22%, of which hydropower (15 TWh 
per year), geothermal power (10 TWh per year) 
and bioenergy (5 TWh per year) accounted for 
nearly all. The share of renewable power in total 
power generation was 12.4% in 2014.
● Drivers for expanding the renewable energy base 
in Indonesia are manifold. Such expansion would 
have significant positive effects on human health 
and the environment through the reduction of air 
and water pollution from mining and burning coal 
(and other fossil fuels). Positive macro-economic 
impacts include the creation of jobs and the 
positive impact on gross domestic product (GDP) 
of using more renewable energy. Imports of 
petroleum products, which have been increasing total demand of 2.0 EJ), a vast majority of which was 
consumed in buildings (83%, mainly in the form of 
fuelwood for cooking), followed by industry (14%) and 
transport (3%). Since 2010, the share of bioenergy has 
remained at the same level, although in the longer term 
its share is decreasing.
Between 2010 and 2014, electricity consumption 
increased by 34%. Its share of TFEC went up slightly in 
the same period, from 9% to 10%, still representing a low 
share compared to the level in developed economies 
at around 30% (the global average was 22% in 2013). 
About two-thirds of electricity is consumed in buildings,

Source: MEMR, 2015and about one-third in industry. The electrification rate 
was 88% in 2015, with a target of 97% for 2019 (MEMR, 
2016a). Finally, natural gas use went up in recent years, 
but its share in the overall energy mix declined: from 
0.5 EJ or 9% in 2010 to 0.6 EJ or 8% in 2014.
The share of renewable energy (including traditional 
biomass) in Indonesia’s TFEC has decreased greatly 
since the turn of the century: from 59% in 2000 to 37% 
in 2013 (IRENA, 2016a). This is due to the increasing 
reliance on modern forms of energy – based mainly on 
fossil fuel burning – in meeting growing energy demand, 
while the share of bioenergy is declining over time.
Buildings
Buildings (residential, commercial and public) account 
for more than one-third of Indonesia’s TFEC, at 2.5 EJ in 
2014 (see figure 4). Although building energy demand 
has increased nearly 20% since 2010, its share in TFEC 
showed little change. Nearly 90% of building energy 
demand is consumed by households, with another 10% 
used in commercial buildings. As in the rest of Southeast 
Asia, cooking represents a majority of household energy 
use in Indonesia and is estimated to account for more 
than 80% of total residential energy demand (Daioglou 
et al., 2012). The remaining 20% is split between space 
cooling, water heating, appliances and lighting. In the 
commercial sector the split is different: half of energy 
demand is used for space cooling, with another 30% 
for appliances and lighting and the remaining 10% for 
cooking and water heating.
Since 2000 the number of households in Indonesia has 
increased by about 1.5% per year – to nearly 65 million 
by the end of 2014 – with a constant average of around 
four people per household. Interestingly, energy 
consumption per household also stayed constant over 
the period, at around 10 MWh per household per year. 
The constant level of final energy demand per household 
in Indonesia is not an outcome of a stagnating appetite 
for energy, but rather is explained by the changing 
composition of the fuel mix, with a transition to more 
efficient forms of energy use (see figure 5). Kerosene, 
used mainly for cooking in Indonesia, had a share 
of over 20% in residential TFEC in 2000. In recent 
years it was substituted on a large scale by LPG due 
to the phasing out of fuel subsidies and a large-scale 
conversion programme by the Indonesian government 
(PLN and WLPGA, 2015). LPG, which is estimated to 
be about 40% to 60% more efficient for cooking than 
kerosene, accounted for 13% of residential energy use 
in Indonesia in 2014, whereas the share of kerosene was 
reduced to less than 2%.

Source: MEMR, 2015In contrast, the share of bioenergy use (almost all 
residential) in building energy demand in Indonesia 
remains high, at over 70%, while in absolute terms its 
use has increased in recent years (see figure 6). In 2013, 
an estimated 24.5 million households (nearly 40% of all 
households) depended primarily on traditional uses of 
bioenergy for cooking (World Bank, 2013). While the 
number of households relying on fuelwood – the main 
form of bioenergy used for cooking – was overtaken by 
those relying on LPG (see figure 6), fuelwood remains 
the dominant source for household cooking in terms of 
final energy consumption. There are great differences, 
however, in the use of fuelwood across provinces. In 
Jakarta less than 1% of households depend on fuelwood 
for cooking, whereas in the 13 provinces with the highest 
poverty rates (mainly in West Nusa Tenggara, Papua 
and Sulawesi), nearly two-thirds of households rely 
primarily on fuelwood as their cooking fuel.
The Indonesian Clean Stove Initiative, a collaboration 
between the Indonesian government and the World 
Bank which was initiated in 2012, is the key programme 
aimed at expanding the use of clean biomass cook 
stoves in the country. These cook stoves, of which 
various types exist, have a higher efficiency and reduce 
indoor air pollution. The initiative provides a roadmap for 
a complete phase-out of traditional uses of bioenergy 
for cooking by 2030. To reach this target, the initiative 
estimates that 10 million households would need to 
use clean biomass cook stoves by 2020, and 18 million 
(about 20% of all households) by 2030. Another form of 
cooking based on modern renewable energy is via the 
efficient use of biogas. The Indonesia Domestic Biogas 
Programme (and various related programmes) spurred 
the installation of some 12–500 units by 2012. Today, 
some 15 000 biogas digesters are reported to have been 
installed, out of a long-term target of 1 million systems 
(MEMR, 2016b).
Electricity is the fastest-growing carrier of energy use 
in buildings, as increasing electrification rates led to a 
near tripling in residential electricity consumption from 
2000 to 2014. Urbanisation was a key factor. In 2000, 
42% of Indonesia’s population lived in urban areas. By 
2014, this had increased to 53% (World Bank, 2016). In 
the commercial segment, electricity consumption grew 
at the same rate and now represents nearly 80% of total 
energy use, up from 40% in 2000. Air conditioning is 
estimated to account for more than half of commercial 
electricity consumption (S-GE, 2013). Sales of air 
conditioning units in all sectors are estimated to grow 
by more than 10% per year between 2013 and 2018 
(BusinessWire, 2014).
Water heating still accounts for a small share of energy 
use in Indonesia, especially in rural areas. Energy demand

Source: World Bank, 2013for this application is expected to increase, however, due 
to economic development and urbanisation. Petroleum 
products and electricity are currently mainly used 
for water heating. Solar water heaters have not been 
adopted on a large scale in Indonesia. The country does 
not include their contribution in its national energy 
statistics, nor are they included in international statistics 
(AEE INTEC, 2015).
Industry
Industry has the largest share of energy consumption 
in Indonesia at 2.7 EJ in 2014 (excluding non-energy 
use), or 36% of TFEC. This represents an increase of 5% 
per year since 2010. Statistics produced by MEMR and 
by the International Energy Agency (IEA) on industrial 
energy consumption seem to differ greatly, with the 
latter’s estimate being nearly 1 EJ (or 37%) lower than 
that of MEMR (IEA, 2015a; MEMR, 2015). The difference 
is explained almost entirely through the estimated use 
of coal, which, according to the IEA, has decreased 
significantly since 2010. According to government 
statistics (which are used for this report) coal remains 
the primary fuel for industrial energy consumption, and 
its use and share in the industrial fuel mix has increased 
rapidly in recent years (see figure 7).
A bottom-up analysis of energy use in selected key 
industrial sectors in Indonesia reveals that aluminium, 
cement, ceramics, brick and paper producers are 
large users of energy in the country (see table 1). As 
Indonesian manufacturers have yet to adopt geothermal 
and solar thermal applications, renewable energy use in 
industry includes only bioenergy, which accounted for 
22% of industrial energy use in 2014. The processing of 
palm oil, sugar and wood is fuelled in part by residues, 
while small-scale kilns for brick production, for example, 
often rely on fuelwood and rice husk (Sopingi and 
Soemarno, 2015).
Transport
Of the main end-use sectors, the growth in transport 
energy consumption has been the fastest in recent 
years. In 2010 transport energy demand stood at 1.5 EJ, 
or 26% of TFEC. By 2014 this had increased to 2 EJ, with 
transport’s share in TFEC expanding to 28%. In absolute 
terms the growth was 30%.
The growth in motorcycles and motor scooters has 
been especially rapid in Indonesia, with the installed 
stock almost doubling between 2008 and 2015 (see 
figure 8). Currently, there are about 400 two-wheelers 
in Indonesia per 1 000 inhabitants, with about 6.7 million 
units sold in 2015 alone. Domestic production of 
motorcycles and scooters in 2015 was about 5.7 million 
units, representing about 85% of domestic sales 
(ASEAN Automotive Federation, 2016). Compared to

other Southeast Asian countries, Indonesia’s sales of 
two-wheelers are particularly high. Sales in 2015 of 
motorcycles and scooters per 1 000 inhabitants totalled 
around 26 in Indonesia, compared with 13 in Malaysia 
and 9 in the Philippines. Clearly, Indonesia is catching 
up with countries like Malaysia and Thailand which have 
even higher rates of two-wheeler penetration (KPMG, 
2014).
Sales of passenger and commercial vehicles were just 
over 1 million per year on average between 2011 and 
2015. While annual sales have grown about 3% during 
the same period, Indonesia’s sales levels are still low 
compared to other countries in the region. In Thailand, 
for example, about 800 000 motor vehicles were sold in 
2015. This is 20% lower than in Indonesia, but in relative 
terms it is much higher given that Thailand’s population is only about one-fourth of Indonesia’s population. 
Overall, Indonesia’s four-wheeler penetration rate in 
2015 remains modest at about 11%, illustrating the 
potential for a further increase to be expected due to 
continued economic development.
About half of all transport energy use in Indonesia in 
2014 was in the form of gasoline used by road vehicles; 
another 40% was consumed in the form of diesel in 
road vehicles. While biodiesel use increased over the 
last couple of years (see next section), the total share 
of biofuels in transport TFEC remained modest, at 
about 2%. Electric mobility is still limited in Indonesia. 
In 2014, electricity used in transport counted for 0.6 PJ, 
or less than 0.03% of total energy consumption in 
transport. Electric vehicles, including electric two- and 
three-wheelers, are not encountered on a large scale yet 
in Indonesia due to a lack of government support and 
regulations. Recently, however, some electric vehicle 
companies have established a presence in the country, 
with a hope that the market will take off in the years to 
come (Manaturi and Tabita Diela, 2015; Octama, 2015). 
In Jakarta, the construction of a rail-based rapid mass 
transit system is also under way. The first phase of 
the project, which is 15.7 kilometres in length and has 
the capacity for up to 173 000 passengers per day, is 
expected to be completed by 2019 (Amindoni, 2016).
Energy production
Fossil fuels
Indonesia is a major fossil fuel-producing country. In 
2014, Indonesia was the largest exporter of coal and 
the fourth-largest coal producer worldwide (IEA, n.d.). 
Coal reserves were estimated at 32 270 million tonnes 
(Mt) in the beginning of 2014, more than 80% of which 
are found on East Kalimantan and South Sumatra 
(MEMR, 2015). The estimated coal reserves would last 
for another 70 years at current production levels. When 
total coal resources (hypothetic, inferred, indicated and 
measured) are considered, this would be 272 years. 
Coal production stood at 458 Mt in 2014, up from 
275 Mt in 2010 and 77 Mt in 2000. Exports accounted 
for 83% of production, with China, India, Japan and 
the Republic of Korea accounting for more than half. 
Most of the coal deposits in Indonesia are medium- and 
low-calorific varieties of sub-bituminous coal, with low 
ash and sulphur content, suitable in particular for power 
generation. Metallurgical coal, used in iron and steel 
making, is found less in Indonesia (GBG Indonesia, 
2014).
Natural gas reserves (proven and potential) in Indonesia 
amount to 149 trillion standard cubic feet of gas (tscf),

Source: IRENA analysis; ADB, 2012; ASEAN Automotive Federation, 2016with production (associated and non-associated) steady 
around 3 tscf per year over the past 15 years. About 1 tscf 
of domestic production in 2014 was used in industry and 
power; another 1 tscf was consumed by liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) plants, and 0.3 tscf was exported through 
gas pipes. Although Indonesia remains Southeast Asia’s 
largest exporter of gas, Indonesia’s share of the global 
LNG market has declined (IEA, n.d.). Its global market 
share was 20% in the early 1990s but had fallen to less 
than 10% by the end of 2013 (EIA, 2014).
Oil reserves (proven and potential) in Indonesia 
amounted to 7.4 billion barrels in January 2014. Crude oil 
production has been decreasing in recent years – from 
517 million barrels in 2010 to 288 million barrels in 2014 
– due to the reliance on mature oil fields and to a lack 
of investment in new oil exploration. Imports therefore 
have increased: between 2000 and 2014, crude oil 
imports increased from 79 million barrels to 122 million 
barrels, while refined product imports increased from 
91 million barrels to 209 million barrels.
Biofuels
Indonesia was the world’s fourth largest producer of 
biodiesel in 2014, behind the United States, Brazil and 
Germany (REN21, 2015). The production of biodiesel in 
Indonesia increased rapidly in the years up to 2014. In 
2009, production was estimated at 190 million litres; 
by 2014 this had increased to 3 961 million litres (MEMR, 
2016b). The number of bio-refineries increased from 7 to 
26 in the same time frame (USDA, 2015).
Exports accounted for just over half of biodiesel 
production in 2014 (see figure 9). The share of exports 
in total production declined greatly in recent years 
due to the increase in domestic biodiesel blending. 
Historically, the European Union (EU) was a key market 
for Indonesian biodiesel, representing 85% of total 
exports in 2012. Following anti-dumping duties of nearly 
19% (on import value) imposed by the EU in 2013, this 
was reduced to virtually zero by 2014 (EC, 2013). Instead, 
China evolved as the primary market for Indonesian 
biodiesel exports at about 55% of total exports in 2014, 
boosted by China’s elimination of biodiesel import 
taxes. Malaysia was the second largest market, at about 
520 million litres (or just over 30% of total exports) in 
2014 (USDA, 2015).
However, 2015 marked several structural changes in the 
Indonesian biodiesel sector. First, the domestic blending 
mandate was again increased, from B10 to B15. Second, 
amid sharply falling oil prices in 2014 many Indonesian 
biodiesel producers faced heavy financial losses, as the 
Indonesian biodiesel reference price was based on a 
gasoil benchmark price (Mean of Platts Singapore). This 
led to a new pricing formula for biodiesel in Indonesia, 
based on the market price of crude palm oil and 
allowing for a 3% margin over the biodiesel production 
cost. Finally, to support local oil companies in adopting 
the new B15 blending mandate, a new agency (the 
Indonesian Palm Oil Estate Fund) was introduced to 
collect funds from palm oil producers through an export 
levy of USD 3 per tonne of crude palm oil. Nevertheless, 
due to administrative issues in the establishment of

Source: MEMR, 2016bthis new agency and in the collecting and managing 
of funds for subsidy, biodiesel production in Indonesia 
dropped sharply. In 2015 just over 1.6 billion litres of 
biodiesel were produced, making Indonesia the eleventh 
largest producer of biofuels globally that year (down 
from its position as fourth the year before) (REN21, 
2016). Lower oil prices globally meant that exports 
decreased significantly, while the domestic blending 
mandate was not fulfilled.
By the first quarter of 2016, it seemed that some 
of the major subsidy issues had been resolved, and 
biodiesel production increased again. The government 
implemented B20 (and B30 for the power sector), 
and compensation was provided by the Indonesian 
Palm Oil Estate Fund for subsidised biodiesel (Public 
Service Obligation – PSO), which is blended for use in 
transport. The target for subsidised biodiesel was set at 
3.2 billion litres for the full year 2016, a sharp increase 
from 2015. In the first half of 2016, 1.3 billion litres of 
subsidised biodiesel were blended (KOMPAS, 2016). For 
the non-subsidised biodiesel (non-PSO, for commerce, 
industry and power generation), a target of 1.3 billion 
litres was set for 2016. In the first half of 2016, however, 
only 50 million litres were blended. This implies that the 
overall target for blended biodiesel (of 4.5 billion litres) 
will likely not be met in 2016, which also has been the 
case in previous years (see figure 10).
Nearly all biodiesel used in Indonesia is produced from 
palm oil. The total area of palm oil plantations in Indonesia 
is estimated at approximately 11 million hectares (Mha) 
today, a rapid increase from just 4 Mha in 2000 (Indonesia 
Investments, 2016a). Crude palm oil used for domestic 
biodiesel production accounted for only 1% of the crop’s 
total production in Indonesia in 2008, but by 2014 this 
had increased to more than 10%. Land clearing for palm 
oil production is associated with adverse environmental 
outcomes, such as carbon dioxide emissions as a result 
of forest fires8. In May 2011, the government imposed 
a moratorium on new palm oil concessions, which was 
reported to be extended by another five years in July 
2016 (Indonesia Investments, 2016b).
Even though Indonesia also has blending mandates 
for ethanol (2% for transport PSO, and 5% for 
transport non-PSO and for industry), subsidies have 
been implemented only for biodiesel. The Indonesian 
ethanol subsidy programme was ended in 2010 due to 
pricing schemes that provided insufficient incentives to

Indonesia, it is at a small scale and is mainly exported 
(USDA, 2015).
Power generation
Total on-grid power generation in Indonesia was 
229 TWh in 2014 (MEMR, 2015). About 77% of this was 
generated by assets belonging to the national utility PLN, 
with the remainder coming from private power utilities 
(PPUs) and independent power producers (IPPs). The 
monopoly position of PLN in power generation has 
been reduced since 2000, when PLN accounted for 
92% of total on-grid power generated in Indonesia. In 
recent years, however, PLN has expanded generation at 
a similar pace as PPUs and IPPs, explaining the minimal 
change of its share in total generation since 2010.
Coal represented a majority of Indonesia’s on-grid 
power generation in 2014 at about 53%, or 120 TWh 
(see figure 11). This share has increased rapidly; in 
2010 the share of coal in power generation was just 
40%. Natural gas accounts for another 25% of power 
generation, with modest changes in its use since 2010. 
Petroleum products have a share of 10% in power 
generation. While the share of petroleum products 
has been stable in recent years, in the longer term it 
has been shrinking (down from 14% in 2000). This 
includes rental contracts with the private sector for 
about 4  GW of diesel generators (mainly in eastern 
parts of Indonesia), the use of which is planned to be 
reduced further (PLN, 2016).
Renewable energy accounted for 11% of Indonesias total 
on-grid power generation in 2014, down from 16% in 
2010 due to the fact that additional electricity demand 
was met largely by coal-fired power. Hydropower and 
geothermal generated 15 TWh and 10 TWh, respectively, 
of electricity that was fed into the grid in 2014. Other 
renewables played a small role in on-grid power 
generation.
On-grid power generation capacity stood at 53.1 GW at 
the end of 2014. Since 2010, nearly 20 GW of generation 
capacity has been added to the grid, most of which 
(13 GW) was new coal power capacity. Geographically, 
more than 70% of on-grid power generation capacity 
is on Java-Bali, with a total of 37.5 GW of on-grid 
generation capacity found there (see figure 12). The 
share of coal-fired power capacity, at about 55%, on 
Java-Bali is higher than in other regions. Renewable 
power has a higher share in Sulawesi & Nusa Tenggara 
(39%) and Sumatra (17%), due mainly to the utilisation 
of hydropower resources. Oil-fired power generation 
plays a larger role on the islands of Kalimantan and in 
Maluku & Papua, where the use of smaller-scale diesel 
generators is still widespread.
Hydropower
On-grid hydropower capacity stood at 5.2 GW by the 
end of 2014, a substantial increase from 3.7 GW in 2010. 
Almost all of the capacity was large-scale hydropower 
(larger than 50 MW by IRENA definition) and was based 
on Java-Bali, Sumatra and Sulawesi & Nusa Teggara. The

was constructed between 1984 and 1988, and is located 
at the Cirata Dam in West Java (Indonesia Hydro 
Consult, 2015). Small-scale installations increased from 
just 14 MW in 2010 to 170 MW by the end of 2014, on the 
back of specific feed-in tariffs for hydropower plants up 
to 10 MW (MEMR, 2015). The feed-in tariff regulation 
for hydropower plants up to 10 MW was updated in 
July 2015, with a new feed-in tariff that exceeds PLN’s 
average cost of power production.
Geothermal
The installed capacity of geothermal power has grown 
modestly in recent years, from 1.2 GW in 2010 to 1.4 GW 
by the end of 2014. This was despite ambitions to grow 
geothermal capacity more quickly: in 2010 the target 
for 2014 was set at 4 000 MW from 44 additional plants 
(Allard, 2010). While a feed-in tariff was introduced in 
2012 for geothermal power, progress has been slow 
due to institutional, regulatory and tariff constraints 
(ADB and World Bank, 2015). Java accounts for 85% 
of installed geothermal capacity, at 1.2 GW. Starting in 
January 2016, more than 1 GW of geothermal power 
projects over eight working areas were scheduled to 
be tendered during 2016 and 2017 (Sundaryani, 2016a).

(mainly from residues and waste in the palm and paper 
industries), 92 MW was grid-connected in 2014. The

Source: IRENA analysisBox 1: Indonesia’s long history in considering nuclear energy
Indonesia has a long history in assessing the potential of nuclear energy in meeting the country’s rapidly 
growing demand for energy. The National Nuclear Energy Agency of Indonesia (BATAN) was founded more 
than five decades ago in 1958, and in the decades since it has led various research and development (R&D) 
initiatives, including the construction of small-scale atomic reactors, fabrication and fuel research, reactor 
safety testing and radioactive waste management (BATAN, 2016). In 1996, the first comprehensive feasibility 
study was conducted for a large-scale nuclear power plant in Indonesia (in central Java). While plans for an 
initial plant were deferred the year after, renewed interest in the potential of nuclear emerged in the early 
2000s, with a power generation strategy showing the option for 2 GW to be developed by 2016.
In 2006 it was decided that an IPP could be awarded a project for building and operating nuclear plants, with 
sites on the central-north coast of Java being considered. Plans for tenders in 2008 were then put on hold, 
and in mid-2010 three sites were being considered in central and west Java and in Bangka Island (off the 
southern coast of Sumatra). For the latter location, BATAN undertook a feasibility study during 2011-2013 and 
identified as much as 10 GW of potential for meeting electricity demand in Sumatra, Java and Bali. However, 
after a change in provincial government, the identified sites on Bangka Island were no longer considered. 
Subsequently, BATAN shifted its focus to West Kalimantan, assessing the potential for small reactor units and 
stating that an initial 30 MW experimental nuclear power reactor could potentially be in operation by 2019. In 
April 2015 the Russian company Rusatom, responsible for promoting Russian nuclear technologies overseas, 
announced that a consortium of Russian and Indonesian companies won a contract for the preliminary design 
of a 10 MW high-temperature reactor in Indonesia (World Nuclear Association, 2015).
At present, the Draft General Plan of Electricity (RUKN) 2015-2034 does not include any target for nuclear 
energy until 2025 (MEMR, 2016a). The 2030 Reference Case for Indonesia, as presented in this report, also 
excludes nuclear energy as part of the energy mix, given recent statements by the government that nuclear 
is not expected to play a part in the country’s energy mix in 2025 and 2050 (Prakoso, 2015).Indonesia 
has a long history in assessing the potential of nuclear energy in meeting the country’s rapidly growing 
demand for energy. The National Nuclear Energy Agency of Indonesia (BATAN) was founded more than five 
decades ago in 1958, and in the decades since it has led various research and development (R&D) initiatives,

excludes nuclear energy as part of the energy mix, given recent statements by the government that nuclear 
is not expected to play a part in the country’s energy mix in 2025 and 2050 (Prakoso, 2015).government is actively stimulating more power from 
bioenergy to be connected to the grid, which was less 
than 20 MW in 2010. Specific feed-in tariffs for biomass, 
biogas and municipal solid waste were put in place to 
support this ambition (Kusdiana, 2014).
Solar PV
Estimates of total solar PV capacity in Indonesia vary, 
from 42 MW by the end of 2012 (MEMR, 2014b) to 80 MW 
installed in 2010 and 2011 alone (IEA, 2015b). For the 
on-grid component, the installed capacity is estimated 
at around 10 MW. The largest power plants are located 
in Bali (2 MW), Kupang (5 MW) and Gorontalo (2 MW). 
By mid-2016 there was over 700 MW in memorandums 
of understanding as well as commitments by PLN to 
develop utility-scale solar PV systems in Indonesia. 
Some involve private sector developers such as Savills, 
Quantum Energy Indonesia and Akuo Energy, as well as 
Indonesia’s state-owned Pertamina (Kurniawan, 2016). 
The announcement in July 2016 of a new feed-in tariff 
to support 250 MW of solar PV installation is likely 
to further support the market in the coming years 
(Susanto, 2016).
Wind
The installed wind power capacity is estimated at 
9.4 MW in early 2016 (WHyPGen, 2016). In the first 
nine months of 2016, three PPAs were signed for the 
development of wind farms in Indonesia: 50 MW in 
Samas (Java), 60 MW in Jeneponto (Sulawesi) and 
70 MW in Sidrap (Sulawesi), which recently achieved 
financial close (Ver-Bruggen, 2016). At the same time 
more than 500 MW in projects was in negotiation 
for PPA or was in the feasibility study/data validation 
stages (WHyPGen, 2016).
Off-grid power
Different estimates exist for the power capacity that is 
not tied to the main grids operated by PLN. This off-grid 
capacity consists of on-site industrial power capacity, 
mini-grids and stand-alone generation in rural areas 
(based on diesel generators, micro hydropower, solar 
PV, biogas plants and micro-wind), and solar home 
systems.
IRENA estimates the on-site industrial power capacity 
at about 4.4 GW in 2014. This includes 1.6 GW of 
bioenergy power capacity that was located in the 
paper (955 MW) and palm (450 MW) industries. 
Geographically, more than 80% was located on 
Sumatra (Kusdiana, 2014). The remaining on-site 
industrial capacity includes waste heat, coal, oil 
and gas. Furthermore, it was estimated that about 
30 000 diesel gen-sets are in operation in rural areas 
of Indonesia, in addition to the 4 600 diesel gen-sets 
that PLN operates (Blocks, 2013). This form of off-grid 
rural power generation is estimated to represent about 
900 MW. This is somewhat below an estimate for 2007 
in which decentralised diesel power plant capacity 
amounted to 987 MW that year (Schmidt et al., 2013).
The Energising Development (EnDev) partnership 
states that it has supported 286 micro hydropower and 
222 solar PV mini-grid installations in Indonesia to date, 
at a reported size ranging from 5 kW to 400 kW (EnDev, 
2015). Most of these were funded by the government, 
and many have been turned over to local governments 
or local communities. IRENA estimates that this 
accounts for about 30 MW of micro hydropower and 
10 MW of solar PV. Finally, an estimated 264 000 solar 
home systems were installed in Indonesia by the end 
of 2010 (IRENA, 2015a). As the common solar home 
system in Indonesia at the time came with a 50 Watt 
module (Sudradjat, 2011), this would imply about 13 MW 
of installed off-grid solar PV capacity by the end of 
2010. Starting in 2012 MEMR has funded the installation 
of about 500 off-grid centralised solar PV systems in 
remote villages. These off-grid systems range in size 
from 5 kW to 150 kW. Aggregate data on biogas plants 
in rural areas and small-scale wind systems are not 
available.
Clearly, renewables already play an important role in 
the off-grid power segment in Indonesia, and more 
potential (in particular for solar PV) has been identified 
to electrify remote villages that are unlikely to be 
connected to larger grids anytime soon.
2.2 Drivers for renewable energy
Indonesia has set ambitious targets for renewable 
energy, which should account for a 23% share of modern 
renewable energy in TPES by 2025, compared to less 
than 6% in 2014. Indonesia, like 163 other countries 
that had national-level renewable energy targets in 
2015, is recognising the many benefits that accelerating renewable energy deployment can have for the country 
(IRENA, 2015b). A brief overview of these is provided 
below.
Health and environmental impacts
In 2012 an estimated 4.3 million people worldwide 
died prematurely from illness related to household air 
pollution, and another 3.7 million premature deaths 
were caused by ambient (outdoor) air pollution (WHO, 
2014). In Indonesia both outdoor and indoor pollution 
present major problems to human health, and fossil fuel 
combustion is a significant contributor. It is estimated 
that existing coal plants in Indonesia were responsible 
for 6,500 premature deaths, with each additional 1 GW 
coal power plant expected to cost around 600 more 
lives per year (Boren, 2015). Indeed, the combustion 
of coal for power generation and industrial processes 
accounts for three-quarters of energy-related sulphur 
dioxide (SO2) emissions in Southeast Asia today, and 
Indonesia accounts for half of the emissions from coalfired power generation in the region (IEA, 2016a).
The rapid increase in the use of motorised vehicles also 
is contributing to poor levels of air quality, particularly 
in Indonesia’s major cities. In Jakarta the average cost 
of air pollution illnesses in 2010 alone was estimated 
at USD 535 million, with PM10 concentrations that 
historically have been twice as high as World Health 
Organization guidelines (ICCT, 2014). The premature 
deaths per year in Indonesia related to negative health 
impacts from indoor air pollution due to traditional 
bioenergy use for cooking are estimated at 165 000, 
making clear the urgency for a transition to modern 
cooking technologies (World Bank, 2013).
Fossil fuel combustion in Indonesia also contributed 
greatly to global warming. Greenhouse gas emissions 
in Indonesia were estimated at 1 800 Mt CO2-eq in 
2005, an increase of 400 Mt CO2-eq from 2000. 
Of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2005, landuse change (including related to fossil fuel resource 
extraction) and peat and forest fires accounted for an 
estimated 63%, and another 19% was directly related 
to fossil fuel combustion. Also in 2015, forest fires from 
land clearing (as discussed in section 2.3) accounted 
for more than 850 Mt of CO2 emissions, with daily 
emissions during the times of fire exceeding total daily 
emissions across the 28 countries of the EU (Huijnen 
et al., 2016).
Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion 
were estimated at 322 Mt CO2 in 2005, and further 
increased to 425 Mt CO2 by 2013 (IEA, 2015c). Nearly 40% 
of emissions in 2013 were related to power generation, 
with another one-third caused by transport. Indonesia’s 
Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) sets an 
unconditional target for greenhouse gas emissions 
reductions by 2030 of 29% below business-as-usual, 
as well as a conditional 41% reduction subject to the 
provision of international support (UNFCCC, 2016).
At a local level, coal mining in Indonesia is having 
direct negative impacts on the environment, including 
contributing to water pollution and desertification. A 
study by Greenpeace on the effects of coal mining 
on water quality in South Kalimantan concluded that 
45% of the region’s rivers are at risk of toxic pollution 
from coal concessions (Greenpeace, 2014). The rapidly 
increasing coal mining activities across Kalimantan 
and the ensuing water pollution is already affecting 
local agriculture (e.g., leakage of wastewater into rice 
paddies) and aquaculture operations (Ives, 2015).
The demand for water for cooling coal power plants 
presents another issue. Despite the abundance of 
fresh water (2 trillion m2 of internal renewable water 
resources, or about 20% of total freshwater in the 
Asia-Pacific region), 37 million Indonesians lack access 
to safe water as a result of insufficient infrastructure 
and distribution networks (Hooley, 2016). Based on 2013 
data it was estimated that 5 GW of coal power capacity 
in Indonesia was planned in red-list areas (defined as 
areas where baseline water stress exceeds 100%), or 
about 12% of the total planned coal power capacity in 
Indonesia at that time.
Macro-economic impacts
The macroeconomic benefits of renewable energy are 
demonstrated by the positive impact on indicators 
such as GDP, trade, employment and welfare (IRENA, 
2016b). For Indonesia, IRENA estimates that accelerated 
renewable energy deployment could increase Indonesia’s 
GDP by between 0.3% and 1.3% in 2030, mainly as a 
result of higher overall levels of investment in the energy 
sector. The trade balance of Indonesia could improve by 
an estimated 0.9% to 1.6% in the same year. At the same 
time, the number of renewable energy-related jobs in 
Indonesia could increase to 1.3 million by 2030, up from 
101 800 in 2015 (IRENA, 2016c). At present, more than 90% of the renewable energy jobs are in the labour-intensive 
palm oil-based biodiesel industry, but this would be more 
diversified if investments in other areas increase. Finally, 
the impact on overall welfare – a broader indicator that 
includes not only the economic dimension but also social 
and environmental factors – is estimated to be between 
3.6% and 5.8% in 2030 (IRENA, 2016b).
The use and manufacture of renewable energy 
technologies also could lead to technology transfer, 
with additional positive indirect effects on the economy. 
Already, technology and innovation have been identified 
as key pillars to the country’s economic growth strategy, 
illustrated by the initiative to establish and develop 
100  science and technology parks across the country 
(INNO SMES, 2015). To support the creation of green 
jobs in Indonesia, skill development is reported as 
a focus area due to a large under-educated labour 
force living in rural areas (causing information lags 
of green knowledge transfer); to green technologies 
not being included in technical education curriculums; 
to underutilised and unclear targeting of vocational 
training centres; and to a lack of educating the public on 
green technologies and knowledge (UNIDO and GGGI, 
2015).
Energy security and access
Despite the fact that Indonesia is a large producer of 
fossil fuels, imports of petroleum products into the 
country have been increasing in recent years, mainly 
to meet the rapidly growing demand for petroleum 
and diesel for transport. The government has identified 
the additional use of domestic natural gas, coal and 
renewables to reduce dependence on energy imports. 
The government and PLN are already actively lowering 
petroleum-based fuel use in power generation, with 
an aim to lower its share of PLN’s generation to below 
6.7% in 2016 (Sundaryani, 2016b). Given the detrimental 
impacts of coal mining and burning on human health 
and the environment, and to ensure the continuation 
of revenues from LNG exports, increasing the use of 
renewable energy presents a clear alternative. Moreover, 
renewables have been identified as a key technology 
in increasing electrification, particularly for connecting 
remote, rural areas of Indonesia.3 CURRENT POLICY FRAMEWORK
in the form of bilateral co-operation on technology 
development and transfer, capacity building, payment 
for performance mechanism, technical co-operation 
and access to financial resources.
Furthermore, the NDC states Indonesia’s strong 
commitment to implement the planned climate change 
mitigation and adaptation activities to be led and 
co-ordinated among various stakeholders including 
governmental institutions and the newly established 
Directorate General of Climate Change, under the 
Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Regulation No. 
21/2008 addresses emission regulations in Indonesia, 
such as the requirement for thermal power plants to 
install emissions monitoring systems and prepare an 
emission inventory. While improvements have been 
made, it is reported that there is no consolidated review 
of impacts, and monitoring and enforcement of the 
regulation may be insufficient at present (UNEP, 2016).
Overall renewable energy targets
In October 2014 the revised National Energy Plan was 
issued as government regulation No. 79/2014, replacing 
the 2006 National Energy Plan. This plan included the 
ambition to reach a renewable energy share of 23% in 
TPES (excluding traditional uses of bioenergy) by 2025 
and at least 31% by 2050, targets which also were stated 
in the country’s NDC. Exports of coal and natural gas 
were stipulated to be reduced gradually due to concerns 
related to energy security (IEA, 2014). The Indonesian 
target matches the region-wide ASEAN target for 
a 23% renewable energy share in TPES by 2025, as 
announced in October 2015 (ACE, 2015b). Indonesia has 
an important role to play in enabling the ASEAN region 
to reach this target, given that the country accounts for 
nearly 40% of the region’s total energy demand.
Power sector targets
The draft National Electricity General Plan (RUKN) 2015-
2034, prepared by MEMR, includes specific targets for 
various renewable energy technologies by 2025. In total, 
renewable energy capacity installed in 2025 is targeted 
to be 45 GW, up from 8.7 GW in 2015 (MEMR, 2016a). 
3.1 Background
The energy sector in Indonesia continues to be heavily 
regulated by the government. While the power 
sector opened up initially in 1985 by allowing private 
sector participation in power generation, the Asian 
financial crisis in the 1990s hit Indonesia hard and 
many PPAs were abandoned or renegotiated. In the 
first decade of the 2000s, private sector participation 
gradually increased again. The first phase of the Fast 
Track Program (FTP) in 2006 aimed to build 10 GW 
of power capacity to meet rapidly growing electricity 
demand, allowing for direct tendering of projects with 
inclusion of the private sector. The 2009 Electricity Law 
strengthened the regulatory framework with a greater 
role for the private sector in power generation, resulting 
in more focus on the use of IPPs in the second phase of 
the FTP, which was launched in 2010.
At present, state-owned enterprise PLN is responsible 
for transmission and distribution of electricity 
in Indonesia, while electricity prices are set by the 
government (PWC, 2013). The government plays a 
large role in other sectors as well. Domestic prices for 
fuels and electricity are directly set by the government, 
while state-owned enterprises like Pertamina (oil and 
natural gas production and exports), PGN (natural gas 
transportation and distribution) and PGE and GDE 
(both geothermal energy) continue to be dominant 
players in their respective industries (ADB, 2015a).
3.2 Renewable energy targets and 
policies
Indonesia’s Nationally Determined 
Contribution
In its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), 
Indonesia pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
unconditionally by 29% by 2030, compared to a 
business-as-usual scenario with projected emissions of 
2 869 Mt CO2-eq in the same year (UNFCCC, 2016). In 
addition, the NDC includes a conditional 41% reduction, 
which is subject to the provision of international support Hydropower represents the largest share, with 21 GW 
installed (of which 3 GW is envisioned to be in the form 
of small-scale hydropower, defined as having less than 
10 MW of capacity per plant), followed by geothermal 
power (target of 7.1 GW by 2025), solar PV (6.4 GW), 
bioenergy power (5.5 GW), ocean power (3.1 GW) and 
wind (1.8 GW).
Power sector regulations
The establishment of MEMR Regulation No. 31 in 2009 
provided PLN with a legal basis for buying renewably 
generated power from IPPs. Regulation No. 4 in 2012 
superseded this regulation, setting specific feed-in 
tariffs for bioenergy power (biomass, municipal solid 
waste and landfill gas) and hydropower projects up to 
10 MW that vary based on the region where the project 
was installed. Since then, more detailed regulations 
have been implemented for various renewable energy 
technologies (see table 2). For larger-scale projects, 
such as hydropower and more recently wind power, 
PLN negotiates directly with project developers for a 
PPA. For most small-scale renewable energy projects 
(up to 10 MW), feed-in tariffs are the policy mechanism 
of choice in Indonesia, although auctions for small-scale 
solar PV projects also were used in the past (Irfany, 
2015).
In 2015 the Indonesian Supreme Court issued a decision 
requiring MEMR to revoke a previous auction regulation 
for solar PV, based on a case by the Indonesian Solar 
Module Association. Until then, seven tenders had been 
conducted for the purchase of solar power (Baker and 
McKenzie, 2015). As a result of this process, seven solar 
tenders, totalling 15 MW, were awarded in the provinces 
of East Nusa Tenggara (five locations), Gorantalo (one 
location) and South Kalimantan (one location) (Susanto, 
2015). The bids were won with tariffs ranging from USD 
0.18 per kWh to USD 0.25 per kWh. In July 2016 a new 
regulation on the purchase of power from solar PV was 
announced (Susanto, 2016).
In February of 2017 it was announced that the Energy 
and Mineral Resources Ministry had issued the latest 
feed-in tariff policy regime for renewable energy. The 
regulation, Minister Decree No. 12 of 2017, covers all 
renewable energy types and sets a price based on 
negotiations between independent power producers 
and PLN. Importantly it sets a feed-in tariff for projects 
in a region that range from 85% up to equal cost of that 
regions PLN production cost. Adjustments are made 
to the feed-in tariff based on differentiations between 
the national and regional production cost (Jakarta Post, 
2017).
To streamline interconnections of renewable generation, 
PLN issued in 2014 its guidelines for connecting 
renewable energy generation plants to PLN’s 
distribution system. These guidelines, applicable to new 
non-PLN owned renewable energy plants that are less 
than 10 MW in size, specified two tracks for connection 
review and analysis. The fast-track review applies to 
smaller projects (<2 MW in Java-Bali, <200 kW outside 
Java-Bali) that meet certain eligibility criteria (not 
exceeding 25% of feeder peak load, compatible line 
configuration, etc.). For other projects, PLN requires 
project developers, in addition, to conduct a connection 
feasibility study, a distribution system impact study and 
a connection facilities study (PLN, 2014a).
PLN states that power system planning is based on 
achieving a lowest net present value of electricity supply 
cost (which is similar to achieving the lowest levelised 
cost of electricity), while meeting certain reliability 
criteria such as loss of load probability less than one day 
per year, with reserve margins of 25-30% in Java-Bali 
and 40% in the rest of the country. Renewable energy 
generation capacity additions are treated as “fixed 
systems” and are permitted to enter the grid with no 
economic optimisation. For small non-interconnected 
or isolated systems, PLN does not apply the economic 
optimisation process, but rather uses a deterministic 
method with a criteria that the minimum reserve must 
be greater than the two largest generation units (PLN, 
2014b).
Transmission and distribution
PLN takes sole responsibility for transmission and 
distribution planning in Indonesia. PLN is responsible 
for expanding transmission capacity and maintains a 
de facto monopoly on distribution expansion through 
a right-of-first-refusal for projects (ADB, 2015a). 
Transmission and distribution plans are captured in 
PLN’s annually updated Electricity Supply Business Plan 
(RUPTL), of which the 2016-2025 edition is the latest 
version (PLN, 2015). Currently Indonesia has about 
40 000 circuit-kilometres of transmission lines across 
eight interconnected networks and 600 isolated grids 
(ADB, 2015a). PLN distinguishes three regions for its operations: Java-Madura-Bali (“JAMALI”), Sumatra and 
East Indonesia (EY, 2015). Expansion plans for the 
period up to 2025 would more than double transmission 
capacity by adding about 67 900 kilometres of 
transmission across the country, where Sumatra 
(25 435  kilometres) and JAMALI (18 471 kilometres) 
account for nearly two-thirds of the total (PLN, 2016).
Included in the plans for transmission expansion is 
the 500 kilovolt direct current (kVDC) interconnection 
between Sumatra and Java in the coming years, to allow 
for additional coal-fired power capacity on Sumatra to 
meet rapidly growing electricity demand in Java and 
to better distribute electricity and alleviate frequent 
blackouts on the two islands (Dahrul, 2014). Plans 
for other interconnection between Indonesia’s islands 
are not included in current plans. At the beginning 
of 2016 the first power trading between Indonesia 
and Malaysia started with the interconnection between 
Sarawak (Malaysia) and West Kalimantan (FMT, 2016). 
A project to connect Malacca (Malaysia) and Sumatra 
is also under way, while a connection between Sabah 
(Malaysia) and North Kalimantan is in the planning 
stages. These projects are part of a larger effort to 
increase interconnections between countries in ASEAN, 
as part of the ASEAN Power Grid initiative. This initiative 
aims to expand cross-border interconnections in the 
ASEAN region from 9 today to more than 30 beyond 
2020 (Hermawanto, 2016).
Up to 2025, distribution capacity also is set to nearly 
double with the addition of 44 000 MVA in transformer 
capacity, 159 000 kilometres of medium-voltage lines 
and 133 000 kilometres of low-voltage lines. This is 
in addition to the 46 800 MVA of capacity that PLN 
operated in 2014, with 925 300 circuit-kilometres of 
distribution lines. It should be noted that power system 
expansions as planned by PLN are often held back by a 
lack of financing as well as time-consuming approvals 
for rights of way and substations (ADB, 2015a). A recent 
regulation allows for the shared use of both transmission 
and distribution networks. Typically, these transmission

This power wheeling regulation opens the possibility for 
power plants to have captive consumers and provide 
electricity to those consumers by utilising PLN’s existing 
transmission and distribution lines. While the details, 
such as wheeling fees, have yet to be announced in the 
upcoming implementing regulations, it provides the 
overall framework for power wheeling in Indonesia.
Electrification
By 2015 the overall electrification rate in Indonesia was 
estimated at 88%, up from just 67% in 2010 (MEMR, 
2016a). The target of the Indonesian government is to 
reach 97% by 2019 and 99.7% by 2026. Great differences 
exist across the various islands of Indonesia (see 
figure 14). While more densely populated and economic 
developed provinces on Java already have electrification 
rates higher than 90%, provinces mainly in the east 
of Indonesia, such as East Nusa Tenggara and Papua, 
are less developed and face electrification rates below 
60%. Electrification in these more remote locations 
will be a combination of providing interconnection 
to existing grids and developing new mini-grids. For 
the latter, distributed solar PV has been identified 
as a key resource, with the potential for electrifying 
close to 7 000 villages (representing about 1.3 million 
households) in this way by 2020.
Targets for end-use sectors and energy 
efficiency
Beyond the power sector, mandates for biofuel blending 
are a priority area for the Indonesian government in 
promoting renewables. Biodiesel targets especially have 
been ambitious, with a mandate for 20% blending in 
diesel for 2016 and a targeted 30% by 2025. These 
targets include not only transport, but also diesel use in 
industry and power generation. For ethanol, blending 
mandates have not been implemented to date, due to 
infrastructure shortcomings, feedstock supply gaps and 
an overall focus on biodiesel (USDA, 2015). Nevertheless, 
ambitious targets for 20% ethanol blending in industry, 
power and transport are set for 2025. In addition, the

for aircrafts by 2018, and 3% by 2020 (Gona, 2013).
Energy efficiency represents another important focus 
area for Indonesia. In 2005, the National Master Plan for 
Energy Conservation (RIKEN) identified the potential to 
reduce energy intensity by 1% per year until 2025. An 
updated draft version of the RIKEN is awaiting approval, 
which includes targets for industry (17% reduction in 
final energy consumption from a business-as-usual 
scenario), transport (-20%) and the commercial and 
residential sectors (-15%) (IEA, 2016b).
3.3 Energy subsidies
Total energy subsidies in Indonesia were estimated 
at USD 27.7 billion in 2014 (about 3% of GDP), almost 
6% of the USD 493 billion in global subsidies to fossil 
fuels in the same year (IEA, 2016c). About 70% of 
subsidies were on oil products (see figure 15), with the 
remainder spent on electricity (mainly for low-voltage 
residential, business and industrial connections). 
Price caps for consumers of diesel, gasoline, LPG and 
electricity explain the vast majority of subsidies. Due 
to the difficulties with estimating fossil fuel subsidies, 
historical estimates for the total subsidy vary somewhat: 
the Asian Development Bank, for example, estimated 
the total energy subsidies in Indonesia at USD 36 billion 
in 2012, compared to USD 29 billion as estimated by the 
IEA (ADB, 2015b).
More recently, the government has taken active steps 
to reduce subsidies on oil products, as the country 
is increasing its reliance on imports of oil products 
amid declining domestic oil production and increasing 
demand. Prices for gasoline and diesel prices were first 
increased by nearly 40% in November 2014. In January 
2015 the government announced that subsidies on 
gasoline would be removed altogether, and that diesel 
prices subsidies are reduced to a fixed gap of IDR 1 000 
(about USD 0.08) per litre. Energy subsidies included in 
the 2016 budget for Indonesia therefore were lowered 
to USD 4 billion, although it is unclear how this breaks 
down into subsidies for various energy carriers.
In 2015 the revised state budget included USD 8 billion 
in energy subsidies (ADB, 2015b). Interestingly, the 
original allocation for oil subsidies was USD 22 billion 
in 2015; the reforms, in combination with rapidly falling 
oil prices, thus had a substantial and immediate effect 
(IISD, 2015). Outside of subsidies on diesel and gasoline, 
subsidies on LPG in Indonesia were estimated at nearly 
USD 4 billion in 2014. The subsidies are applied to the 
sales of 3 kilogram cylinders, to support energy access 
for low-income households. LPG use for cooking was 
supported by the Indonesian government on a large

Electricity Oil
Source: IEA, 2016cscale, to mitigate health damages from the use of 
traditional bioenergy for cooking. Prices for 3 kilogram 
LPG canisters, which have not changed since 2010, are 
among the lowest in the world (IISD, 2016).
Electricity subsidies increased until 2014, from USD 
5.7 billion in 2012 to USD 8.4 billion in 2014, an increase 
of 47%. As electricity sales during the same time went 
up by just 7% (MEMR, 2015), the subsidy on electricity 
increased from USD 0.033 per kWh in 2012 to USD 
0.042 per kWh in 2014 (in nominal terms). This is 
despite an increase in electricity prices of 15% in 2013, 
where households consuming 450-900 volt-amperes 
were not included. Besides increasing sales, escalating 
prices for fossil fuel inputs and exchange rate revisions 
are named as main causes for the increasing subsidies 
on electricity. Apart from price caps, some subsidies to 
PLN in the form of soft loans and loan guarantees were 
provided, but they represent only a small fraction of the 
total (about USD 72 million in 2013) (ADB, 2015b).
During 2014 and early 2015 the government continued 
to increase electricity prices, mainly for large residential, 
industrial and governmental users. Electricity prices 
vary greatly between different types of users, from 
IDR 415 per kWh (about USD 0.03 per kWh) for small 
residential users to nearly IDR 1 500 per kWh (USD 0.11 
per kWh) for large-scale industrial and government 
users. While the high end of the electricity price range 
is in line with the market price as estimated by PLN, 
small-scale users of electricity thus continue to enjoy 
subsidised tariffs (IISD, 2015).
All in all, the removal of subsidies on gasoline and 
the large reduction in diesel subsidies, with estimated 
public savings of USD 15 billion in 2015, shows that the 
Indonesian government is making progress towards 
implementing its G20 pledge on phasing out subsidies 
on energy prices. Important to note is that potential 
subsidies associated with the government programme 
to add 35 GW of power generation capacity by 2019, a 
large part of which is coal-fired, is not (yet) reflected 
in energy subsidy estimates. It is reported that public 
finance and guarantees might be included in these plans 
as well (ODI, 2015).
While the Indonesian law does not allow for the 
earmarking of specific funds, the subsidy removals have 
allowed for the development of the Energy Resiliency 
Fund (Alvionitasari, 2016). The regulation for the 
framework of this fund is being developed, although it 
is said that the process is currently on hold. Renewable 
energy support and rural electrification could be part of 
the programmes that are envisioned to be supported 
by this fund, while some of the resources would be set 
aside to guard against oil price fluctuations.4 REFERENCE CASE DEVELOPMENTS TO 
2030
for 4% of total power generation, with the highest 
share in Maluku & Papua (at 15%) due to the 
ambitious plans there for scaling up solar PV.
● More than 70% of renewable energy use in 2030 
is represented by the modern use of bioenergy. 
Bioenergy use in industry increases in line with 
the sector’s overall increase in energy use, up 
to 656 PJ, which is more than a doubling from 
today’s levels. In buildings, 602 PJ of bioenergy 
use is projected for 2030, down from 1 620 PJ in 
2014. This shift is mainly because of households 
shifting from using fuelwood for cooking to using 
electricity and LPG instead.
● In transport, there is a strong increase in the 
absolute use and relative share of liquid biofuels, 
as a result of projected B30 and E20 blending 
mandates from 2025 onwards. Total use of 
liquid biofuels in transport increases from 57 PJ 
(1.8 billion litres) in 2014 to 700 PJ (25 billion 
litres) in 2030, resulting in a 17.2% share for 
renewable energy in TFEC in transport (from 
2.8% in 2014). This could come with significant 
supply-side challenges; the additional potential 
for sustainable production from energy crops is 
limited.
This chapter discusses the Reference Case developments 
in Indonesia. The Reference Case represents the 
developments in Indonesia’s entire energy system 
until 2030 based on current government outlooks. The 
Reference Case for Indonesia is based on three main 
sources:
● The National Energy Policy (KEN) scenario of the 
MEMR Energy Outlook Indonesia 2014 was used 
to generate a business-as-usual outlook for TFEC 
and the breakdown of fuels consumed therein 
(MEMR, 2014a).
● The National Electricity General Plan (RUKN) 
2015-2034 was used for the Reference Case 
Key points
● Indonesia has a target for (modern) renewable 
energy to represent 23% of TPES by 2025. This 
target is reflected in the National Energy Policy 
(KEN) scenario of the Energy Outlook Indonesia 
2014 and the National Electricity General Plan 
(RUKN) 2015-2034 from the Ministry of Energy 
and Mineral Resources, which were used to 
develop a business-as-usual scenario for 2030 
(referred to in this study as the “Reference Case”).
● The projections show a strong overall increase 
in energy use. TFEC increases by nearly 80% in 
2014-2030 to reach more than 13 EJ per year. 
The Reference Case takes Indonesia’s modern 
renewable energy share in TFEC to 16.6% by 2030. 
In terms of the share of renewables in TPES, 
the increase is from 8.8% in 2014 to 25.3% in 
2030 (based on the “physical energy content” 
calculation method for TPES). In absolute terms, 
the use of modern renewable energy increases 
more than five-fold, up to nearly 2 200 PJ per year.
● Power generation increases from 240 TWh in 
2014 – including 15 TWh of off-grid generation 
– to 826 TWh in 2030. The share of renewable 
energy in total power generation increases to 
28.6% – or 236 TWh per year – in the Reference 
Case. Hydropower accounts for the largest source 
of renewable power (at 107 TWh per year), 
followed by geothermal power (62 TWh per 
year), bioenergy power (32 TWh per year), marine 
energy (16 TWh per year), solar PV (13 TWh per 
year) and wind power (6 TWh per year).
● Java-Bali accounts for about 70% of total power 
generation, but only 16% of renewable power 
generation, in the Reference Case. Instead, 
the highest shares for renewable power are in 
Sulawesi & Nusa-Tenggara and Kalimantan, mainly 
because of the availability of hydropower. Variable 
renewable power (solar, wind, marine) accounts for the power sector, where five regions were 
distinguished: Java-Bali, Kalimantan, Maluku & 
Papua, Sulawesi & Nusa Tenggara and Sumatra 
(MEMR, 2016a). The revised KEN 2025 targets for 
the various renewable power technologies were 
used to derive estimates for the installed power 
capacity for each by 2030.
● Finally, as the RUKN power generation target for 
2030 exceeds the power generation target that 
is included with the KEN scenario of the Energy 
Outlook Indonesia 2014, TFEC estimates from the 
latter were increased, reflecting higher growth 
in overall energy demand and a higher share of 
electricity in energy use.
It should be noted that, as table 3 illustrates, there is 
a significant discrepancy in the outlook for renewable 
energy in the power sector included in the National 
Electricity General Plan from MEMR and the latest 
Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL) from PLN 
(PLN, 2016). The targets of MEMR for 2025 for all 
renewable energy technologies – which are taken into 
account to develop the Reference Case for 2030 – are 
significantly higher than those as incorporated by PLN 
into their plans. Therefore the Reference Case 2030, 
based on the outlook of MEMR, can be considered 
ambitious in terms of renewable power, although recent 
policies (e.g., the solar PV feed-in tariff) do indicate 
the intent of the government to further accelerate 
deployment.
As shown in figure 16, Indonesia’s fuel mix is expected 
to change significantly in the Reference Case. Of the 
conventional fuels, the share of natural gas is projected 
to increase the most, from 12% of TPES in 2014 to 19% in 
2030, mainly as a result of increased gas use in industry. 
The share of oil, on the other hand, will further decline 
to account for just 20% of TPES by 2030, as its use in 
power generation decreases while the blending of liquid 
biofuels (mainly in transport) increases. The share of 
modern renewable energy will increase from 8.7% in 
2014 to 25.2% by 2030. The latter is somewhat higher 
than Indonesia’s renewable energy target for 2025, 
which is for a 23% share of modern renewable energy in 
TPES that year. This is due to the continued growth in 
renewables that is assumed in 2025-2030. Geothermal 
and modern uses of bioenergy account for nearly 90% 
of total modern renewable energy use in primary energy 
terms.
Based on the Reference Case, Indonesia’s TFEC will 
increase to 13 EJ in 2030, an increase of 78% from 7.3 EJ 
in 2014 (see figure 17). The largest increase is in industry, 
which will grow by 114% from 2014, to account for 44% 
of TFEC in 2030. Transport follows with a 100% increase 
to account for 31% of Indonesia’s TFEC in 2030. Energy 
consumption in buildings increases less, and its share 
shrinks to 23% of TFEC in 2030. The substitution of 
traditional bioenergy used for cooking by more efficient 
cooking fuels explains this trend. Agriculture accounts 
for the remainder, at about 2% of total TFEC.
Figure 18 shows the development of the renewable 
energy shares in TFEC and power generation in 
Indonesia based on the Reference Case. In total, the 
share of renewable energy (excluding traditional uses 
of bioenergy) in TFEC increases from close to 5.8% 
in 2014 to 16.6% in 2030. This is lower than the share 
of renewable energy in TPES, due mainly to the low 
conversion efficiency assumed for geothermal power 
(10%) as per the physical energy content method.

Source: IRENA analysisAmong the end-use sectors, the largest increase in 
the share of renewables in TFEC is in buildings: from 
2.5% in 2014 to 18.2% in 2030, due to a reduction of 
traditional uses of bioenergy for cooking and increasing 
electrification. Without the share of electricity 
consumption that is generated by renewable power, the 
share would be just 5.9% by 2030. In transport the share 
of renewable energy also increases significantly, from 
2.8% in 2014 to 17.2% in 2030, due to increasing blending 
mandates for biofuels. In industry, the renewable energy 
share increases from 11.6% in 2014 to 15.4% in 2030, due 
to the increased reliance on bioenergy and electricity for 
meeting growing energy demand.
The share of renewables in power generation 
increases from 12.4% in 2014 to 28.6% in 2030. Based 
on the projections for the various renewable energy 
technologies, the share of renewable energy in power 
generation varies among regions in 2030 (see figure 19). 
Java-Bali, which accounts for 70% of total energy 
generation in Indonesia in 2030, would have a 16% 
share of renewables in power generation. In contrast, 
in Sulawesi & Nusa Tenggara the renewables share is 
projected to be 71% in 2030, while in Kalimantan it will 
be 55%. This is due mainly to the fact that most of the 
hydropower potential that is planned to be exploited 
is not found on Java-Bali. The share of VRE in power 
generation will be 4% for Indonesia as a whole, while it 
is projected to be the highest in Maluku & Papua at 15%, 
due to a relatively high level of planned installations of 
solar PV there.
Total power generation increases from 240 TWh in 
2014 to 824 TWh in 2030. The share of off-grid power 
generation decreases in the same time frame, from 
close to 6% to just 1%. Renewable power generation 
increases more than eight-fold, from 29 TWh in 2014 to 
235 TWh in 2030. This includes both on-grid and off-grid 
generation, with the latter including mini-grids and offgrid solutions based on solar PV, micro hydropower and 
bioenergy power used exclusively for own consumption. 
Off-grid renewable power generation accounts for less 
than 5% of total renewable power generation in 2030.
Hydropower maintains the largest source of renewable 
power generation at 106.9 TWh in 2030, representing 
a more than six-fold increase from 2014 (see figure 
20). Geothermal generation (62.1 TWh in 2030) and 
bioenergy (31.3 TWh) grow five-fold and six-fold from 
2014, respectively. Finally, VRE generation technologies 
are projected to account for nearly 35 TWh by 2030 
(about 4% of total power generation), explained by 
15.8 TWh of marine energy, 13 TWh of solar PV and 
5.7 TWh of wind energy. The significant contribution of 
marine energy is due to the ambitious outlook for the 
technology in the revised KEN targets (3.1 GW by 2025)

Source: IRENA analysisand to its relatively high capacity factor (40%). Lower 
average capacity factors – in addition to the respective 
KEN targets (see table 3) – for solar PV (16%) and wind 
power (25%) explain their more modest contributions.
In the Reference Case there will be 199 GW of power 
capacity, of which 138 GW is conventional and 61 GW 
is renewable generation capacity (see figure 21). Coal 
will continue to account for most of the installed 
power generation capacity at nearly 90 GW, implying 
annual installations of nearly 4 GW per year until 2030. 
Only 700 MW of on-grid diesel power generation 
capacity (500 MW of which is off-grid) is assumed 
in the Reference Case for 2030. Of the renewable 
technologies, hydropower will have the highest installed 
capacity at 28.6 GW, followed by solar PV at 9.3 GW.
The transport sector is projected to have the second 
highest share of renewable energy in final energy 
consumption by 2030 at 17.2%. Out of 894 PJ of total 
liquid biofuels consumption by 2030 (see figure 22), 
699 PJ (or nearly 80% of the total) will be consumed 
in transport. This projection is based on the blending 
mandates of 20% for ethanol and 30% for biodiesel 
targeted for 2025, which are assumed to be maintained 
until 2030. As a result, about 13 billion litres of biodiesel 
and 12 billion litres of ethanol are required to meet these 
targets. This represents a big increase; for 2016 the 
targeted domestic biofuel consumption is estimated 
at around 3.2 billion litres of biodiesel. Electric mobility 
remains minimal in the Reference Case at just 15 PJ, 
or 0.4% of transport TFEC. The contribution to total 
renewable energy use in transport from renewable 
power generation is therefore small at around 0.1%.
In buildings, 602 PJ (35 million tonnes) of bioenergy use 
is projected for 2030, down from 1 620 PJ (95 million 
tonnes) in 2014. The shift is due in particular to a decrease 
in the number of households relying on fuelwood for 
cooking: from around 24 million households in 2014 
to an estimated 8 million by 2030. Traditional uses of 
bioenergy for cooking would still account for nearly 
90% of total bioenergy used in buildings in 2030. 
The remainder consists mainly of commercial use of 
liquid biofuels, and an estimated 2 million households 
using biogas digesters for cooking. The reduction in 
bioenergy use is explained mainly by the increase in LPG 
and electricity for cooking. LPG is estimated to be the 
primary cooking fuel for 70% of households in 2030 (up 
from 62% today), while 19% of households use electric 
cooking (compared to 2% in 2014).
Industrial energy demand for process heat generation 
will increase to 4.9 EJ by 2030, up from 2.4 EJ in 2014. 
The implied annual growth is 4.6%, in line with historical 
growth in industrial heating demand (5% per year 
between 2010 and 2014). Bioenergy use in industry 
increases to 656 PJ (39 million tonnes), an increase 
of 240% from 2014. More than 90% of bioenergy use 
consists of solid biomass (91%), with the remaining 9%

of bioenergy in total heating demand is projected to 
increase modestly in the same time frame, from 11.5% in 
2014 to 13.3% in 2030. Paper, pulp and printing, as well 
as cement, ceramics, bricks and food continue to be key 
industrial sectors for energy use in industry. Combined 
they account for about one-third of total industrial 
bioenergy use in 2030.

COST
and how this correlates with the demand for power and 
the projected renewable energy deployment for each 
region in the Reference Case. Sumatra, Kalimantan and 
Maluku & Papua together account for more than 75% of 
the renewable energy power potential. Java-Bali is where 
70% of power demand will be in 2030, while it has direct 
access to only 10% of the total renewable potential for 
power generation in Indonesia.
Based on the potential for each of the regions and 
on available roadmaps for some of the renewable 
technologies (e.g., solar PV, hydropower, geothermal), 
the second column in table 4 shows what the assumed 
renewable power capacity for each of the regions is in 
the Reference Case for 2030. Comparing these planned 
deployment levels with the theoretical potential per 
renewable resource and the total demand for power 
in each of the regions provides the initial basis for the 
estimation of the REmap Options. However, important 
constraints and other considerations also are taken 
5.1 Power generation
Based on available data, an estimated 716 GW of 
theoretical potential for renewable energy-based 
power generation has been identified in Indonesia (see 
table 4). The potentials shown take into consideration 
the supply-side constraints of resource and land 
availability, but not other constraints such as limitations 
imposed by insufficient power demand nearby and/
or transmission networks. Therefore, capturing all of 
these resources is unlikely to be feasible, but these 
figures do provide an indication of the magnitude of 
the total potential. The figures provided are based on 
the resource potential identified in existing studies; for 
marine and wind, such resource mapping is ongoing 
and therefore their theoretical potential is likely to be 
higher than what is shown.
Five regions have been distinguished to develop an 
understanding of where the theoretical potential is based

Solar PV
Solar PV has the highest resource potential in Indonesia 
at 532.6 GW, explained by the high solar resource across 
Indonesia, which is in the range of 4.0-6.9 kWh/m2 and 
averages 4.8 kWh/m2 (Veldhuis and Reinders, 2013). The 
estimated potential for different regions is partially a 
result of these differences in resource across the country 
(which is somewhat higher in the eastern part of the 
country), but is mainly an outcome of differences in the 
availability of land and rooftops (IRENA, n.d.).
Solar PV is expected to be used on a significant scale by 
2030 in three ways: in utility-scale plants, on residential 
and commercial rooftops, and in off-grid settings for 
electrification in remote areas or to displace costly 
diesel-powered generation. The off-grid potential for 
solar PV has been estimated by MEMR at 2.1 GW, with 
the largest potential represented by Maluku & Papua 
(0.95 GW) and Sulawesi & Nusa Tenggara (0.42 GW)9. 
In the Reference Case, it is assumed that this potential 
will have been fully exploited by 2030 through active 
efforts by the government and PLN to use solar PV to 
provide electricity to 1.1 million households currently not 
electrified.
With an overall target of 6.4 GW of solar PV installed 
by 2025, the Reference Case for 2030 assumes that 
the market continues to grow until 2030 to reach 
9.3 GW of installed capacity in that year. With 2.1 GW 
of this assumed to be related to the off-grid solar 
segment, 7.2 GW is allocated to grid-tied solar PV. As 
the theoretical potential for solar PV exceeds 500 GW, 
this implies that less than 1% of this will be captured by 
2030, despite abundant potential across the different 
regions of Indonesia.
From the distribution of daily electricity demand 
throughout the day, it becomes obvious that there is 
a relatively sharp evening peak, explained mainly by 
the use of rice cookers at that time (see figure 23). This 
9 These calculations include an estimate of the future electricity 
use per household at 1.8 kW, which is significantly higher than 
current levels of electricity use in rural households. Due to this 
conservative assumption – in terms of not underestimating future 
electricity needs – on the part of MEMR, this implies that the 
deployment of off-grid solar PV in terms of power capacity could 
thus be lower.
might limit the potential for renewables and in particular 
solar PV (without any storage), due to the mismatch 
between the peak in demand and the time of day when 
solar PV produces at its peak. However, the anticipated 
rapidly increasing demand for cooling in buildings (from 
29% of electricity consumption in 2014 to 35% in 2030) 
is likely to flatten electricity demand, increasing the 
opportunity for solar PV to match electricity demand 
in buildings.
Hydropower
Based on a study of 1 249 locations, the resource 
potential for large hydropower in Indonesia has been 
estimated at 75 GW (MEMR, 2016c). Of this, 18.3 GW is 
targeted for exploration until 2025 (MEMR, 2016d). In 
the Reference Case this will increase further to 24.3 GW 
by 2030, nearly one-third of the total potential. Table 
4 shows, however, that nearly three-quarters of the 
potential is based in regions with lower levels of power 
demand: Kalimantan, Sulawesi & Nusa Tenggara and 
Maluku & Papua. Indeed, these regions combined 
account for only 12% of the estimated power generation 
in Indonesia in 2030. Lacking a detailed deployment 
roadmap for large-scale hydropower, it is therefore 
assumed in the Reference Case that all of the potential 
in Java-Bali and about 60% of the potential in Sumatra 
already have been captured by 2030.
For small hydropower the potential was estimated at 
19.4 GW, most of it in Kalimantan (42% of total resource) 
and Sumatra (30% of total resource). In the Reference 
Case, about 20% of the total potential for small 
hydropower, or nearly 4 GW, will be grid-connected by 
2030. Another 300 MW is assumed to be used off-grid 
or in mini-grids.
It is important to note that a large share of the 
hydropower resource is based in protected forest areas 
or might come with a high number of resettlements. In 
a 2011 study that focused on 26 GW of existing, planned, 
ongoing and potential projects (which all passed the 
third screening of the Second Hydro Power Potential 
Study conducted in 1996-1999) it was estimated that 
only 8 GW could be developed by 2027 if no projects 
located in protected areas would be considered. A 
“policy-oriented scenario” estimated that 14.8 GW 
would be developed by the same year, but 20 projects 
would be located in protected areas (MEMR, PLN and 
JICA, 2011). Others have estimated the economically feasible hydropower potential at 40 TWh/year, or 
around 10 GW (IHA, 2015). Clearly the hydropower 
targets set by the government are ambitious in light of 
these considerations.
Bioenergy
The total potential for power generation from bioenergy 
is estimated at 32.7 GW, nearly half of which is on 
Sumatra (MEMR, 2016b). Palm oil represents about 
12.7  GW of the total potential, with the remainder 
coming from rice husk (9.8 GW), natural rubber 
(2.8 GW), municipal solid waste (2.1 GW), corn (1.7 GW), 
solid wood (1.3 GW), sugar cane (1.3 GW), cow dung 
(0.5  GW), cassava (0.3 GW) and coconut (0.2 GW). 
In the Reference Case, 7.2 GW, or about 22% of the 
potential, is utilised by 2030. With the government’s 
ambition to increase bioenergy power generation on 
the grid, the assumption is that 60% of the installed 
capacity will be grid-tied, with another 40% used for 
captive power.
Geothermal
An estimated 40% of the world’s geothermal reserves 
are found in Indonesia, and the potential use for power 
generation is estimated at 29.4 GW (MEMR, 2016e). Of 
the total potential, 1.4 GW has already been exploited 
(1.2 GW of which is on Java), 17.2 GW is labelled as 
“reserve” (which implies that it is based on a detailed 
investigation), and 12.2 GW is classified as “speculative 
and hypothetical resource”. Given that a large number 
of possible sites are found in forest areas, and since 
their assessed potentials could be overestimated, the 
country’s realistic deployment potential by 2030 might 
be lower (ADB and World Bank, 2015). The government 
target for 2030 – included in the Reference Case – is to 
reach 8.9 GW of geothermal power capacity. Based on 
detailed plans until 2025, most additional capacity is 
expected in Java-Bali (5.3 GW by 2030 in the Reference 
Case), which is home to about one-third of the total 
geothermal potential and nearly 40% of the currently 
unexploited “reserve” of 17.2 GW. Next is Sumatra 
(3.0 GW installed by 2030 in the Reference Case), which

about 44% of the total.
Marine energy
Marine energy is an emerging technology, with 
547 MW installed globally by the end of 2015 (IRENA, 
2016d). While none of this was based in Indonesia, the 
government has set a target to reach 3.1 GW of installed 
marine energy capacity by 2025 (MEMR, 2016d). This 
can be considered ambitious given the immaturity of 
the technology. In the Reference Case, it is assumed 
that the market would continue with the same level of 
deployment in 2025-2030 as before, and the installed 
capacity would reach 4.5 GW by 2030.
As of today only the potential of ocean currents has been 
measured. The total potential (from 10 locations) of tidal 
energy has been estimated at 18 GW (MEMR, 2016f). 
The Riau islands (included with Sumatra in table 4) and 
the Alas Strait (in Western Nusa Tenggara) account for 
nearly 12.6 GW, or about 70% of the total tidal potential. 
While current velocity across the locations varies from 
1.39 to 3.00 metres per second (or 1.38 to 13.84 kW/m2) 
this lasts for only about two hours of the day, which 
in combination with the remoteness of key resources 
limits the potential of tidal energy. Ocean Thermal 
Energy Conversion (OTEC) – which uses the difference 
in temperature between (cooler) deep and (warmer) 
surface water to generate electricity – is thought to have 
high potential as well, even though the exact resource 
has not been assessed in detail yet. Therefore, the 
assumptions for the Reference Case are based on the 
tidal energy potential alone, with most of the installed 
capacity by 2030 estimated to be on Java-Bali (2.1 GW) 
and Sumatra (1.7 GW).
Wind
The total potential for onshore wind energy was 
estimated at 9.3 GW in Indonesia (MEMR, 2016g). Of 
this, about 960 MW has been identified as ready for 
development immediately, with half of this found to be 
on Java-Bali and another 25% on Sulawesi. Measurement 
of the wind resource was first started by the National 
Institute of Aeronautics and is ongoing, with 171 sites 
evaluated up to now at a typical measurement height 
of 50 metres. Based on the distribution of the evaluated 
sites and the identified short-term potential across 
wind locations, it is estimated that nearly 85% of the 
wind power potential is on Java-Bali, Sulawesi and Nusa 
Tenggara. The government targets 1.8 GW of installed 
wind capacity by 2025, with capacity factors estimated 
at 20-30%.
The Reference Case assumes that the level of 
deployment continues at the same pace as before. 
Hence, the installed capacity further expands to 2.6 GW 
by 2030, 28% of the total potential identified so far. Most 
of this (74%) is assumed to be on Java-Bali, given the 
combination of good wind resources (many sites with 
more wind speeds above 6 metres per second, mainly 
along the coastline) and high electricity demand (IRENA, 
n.d.). Offshore wind energy thus far has not been 
included in Indonesia’s renewable energy ambitions. Its 
application is not considered viable at present, given 
that the potential is mainly in the Indian Ocean, where 
costs are anticipated to be high due to the sea depth.
Generation cost
There is a wide range in the estimated cost of renewable 
power generation in Indonesia across technologies, 
depending on the type of application, project size and 
capacity factors (see figure 24). The wide ranges across 
technologies are explained by the difference in cost 
encountered for larger-scale projects in easily accessible 
locations (e.g., on Java) and smaller projects in remote 
locations. Generally, hydropower and geothermal have 
some of the lowest generation costs. For geothermal 
power this is explained by the high capacity factor 
(about 80% historically), even though there is a wide 
range in project capital cost that is site-specific. For 
hydropower the capacity factor is lower in Indonesia 
(historically at 33-37%), but large-scale projects come 
at a relatively low cost per installed kW. New projects in 
perhaps less-suitable locations than those exploited to 
date are likely to come with higher project cost, however. 
For bioenergy power the main variables explaining the 
spread in the estimated generation cost are the project 
capital cost, which varies significantly by case, and the 
estimated capacity factor. For captive power, the latter 
is assumed to be just 26% based on historical data, while 
for on-grid bioenergy power, based on the average 
observed capacity factor for the Asia region (excluding 
China), this is assumed to be 66%.
Wind (onshore) and especially solar PV show 
considerable ranges in generation cost, explained by 
their application (grid-tied versus off-grid in remote locations), project size (utility-scale versus small 
distributed cases) and resource differentials (especially 
in the case of wind). The costs for new larger-scale solar 
PV projects are likely to be at the lower end of this range, 
or even below. This is because the estimates shown are 
based on completed projects, which often have incurred 
learning costs since (larger-scale) solar PV projects are 
still relatively rare in Indonesia. Furthermore, there exists 
large potential for global cost reductions for solar PV, 
and the levelised cost for Indonesia – also considering 
the country’s relatively high levels of insolation (16% 
average capacity factor) – could be much lower as the 
local industry and market mature.
In general, in comparing the cost ranges for renewables 
with the current cost of non-renewable power 
generation, it is clear that the potential for deployment 
in Indonesia based on competitive grounds already 
exists for renewable energy power. The business case 
for renewables will only strengthen based on further 
cost reductions and technology innovations.
5.2 Bioenergy
Supply potential
Bioenergy is a key resource for all types of energy in 
Indonesia, including heating, power generation and 
transport. Based on historical data on agricultural and 
forestry production in Indonesia, the technical potential 
for residues for bioenergy was estimated at 756 PJ (see 
table 5). Palm oil, rice and sugar accounted for nearly 
half of the potential for using agricultural residues, 
while residues in the wood industry accounted for 
nearly 60% of total forestry residue potential. However, 
many other potential feedstocks for bioenergy in 
Indonesia have been identified that are not included in 
this assessment, including jatropha curcas, pongame 
pinnata, calophyllum inophyllum (nyamplung), and 
candle nut (for biodiesel production) and sago, sugar 
palm, cassava and sorghum (for ethanol production) 
(Prastowo, 2011).
Used cooking oil also could be used to supply increasing 
biodiesel production targets, with the minimum 
potential availability from food processors estimated at 
84 000 tonnes per year, while the potential collections 
from restaurants and food stall vendors adds another 
562 364 tonnes per year (Ecofys, 2013). Currently about 
120 000 tonnes of used cooking oil are collected by 
Indonesia’s three main collectors, and smaller collectors 
gather another 65 000 tonnes. The large collectors 
export the oil (mainly to the EU), where most of it 
is already being used for biodiesel production. Small 
collectors are using a majority of the used cooking oil 
for non-energy purposes.
For biogas in households, the potential for usage in 
Indonesia was estimated at 1 million household biodigesters, based on a feasibility study by the Netherlands 
Development Organisation (SNV) in 2008 that took

By 2030 the potential could be significantly higher. 
Farmers on Java especially could substantially reduce 
spending on cooking fuels by switching to biogas, 
although awareness in the communities of the potential 
returns is lacking (World Bank, 2013). In additional, the 
easily available potential for biogas in industry based on 
palm oil mill effluent is estimated at 32 PJ per year today 
(Stichnothe, 2016).
For 2030, IRENA estimates that the total sustainable 
bioenergy supply potential in Indonesia ranges from 
3 039 PJ to 4 449 PJ per year (see figure 25)10. The 
highest potential is for fuelwood at 1 556 PJ to 1 608 PJ 
per year. This indicates that there is enough fuelwood 
available that is suitable for use in modern bioenergy 
cook stoves, and can be collected without anticipated 
effects on land-use change. The potential for wood 
residue (logging and processing) and wood waste 
(construction, demolition and furniture) ranges from

supply potential can be found at https://www.irena.org/remap/

595 PJ to 673 PJ per year, significantly higher than the 
estimate based on historical data. This is due in part to 
the included potential of recycling wood waste (231-
262 PJ per year), which is not included in the estimates 
in table 5, as well as rising levels of production until 
2030.
The potential for agricultural residues (harvesting and 
processing) is estimated at 589 PJ to 1 338 PJ per year. 
The average of the range (963 PJ per year) is about 50% 
higher than the estimate for 2010 as provided in table 5, 
explained in part by the increasing levels of agricultural 
production expected until 2030. The potential for animal 
manure and waste by 2030 is estimated at 137-668 PJ 
per year. This includes the potential for using palm oil 
mill effluent as biogas, which is estimated to range 
from 119 PJ to 204 PJ per year in 2030, based on the 
current potential for biogas and a range in the growth 
projection for palm oil production in Indonesia.
Energy crops from non-forest land have a more limited 
potential by 2030, at 162 PJ per year, which is estimated 
as the current production of energy crops (palm oil for 
biodiesel) increased by the expected yield increase of

Source: Prastowo, 20110.7% per year. Given the government moratoriums on 
palm oil concession (which should be in effect until 
2021), as well as the expansion of agricultural lands to 
meet the increasing demand for food and palm oil, no 
additional land is assumed to be available sustainably 
for energy crops until 2030.
Estimates for the potential of bioenergy supply 
in Indonesia vary based on methodology and the 
assumptions made. Table 6 shows the potentials as 
estimated by IRENA, and as found in other literature. 
For residues, IRENA’s estimates are within the range 
as estimated before. A recent study estimated 
the sustainable potential from palm oil residues in 
Indonesia at 491 PJ (mainly from trunk and fibre) 
in 2030 in a business-as-usual scenario (IEE, 2016). 
This seems to be in line with IRENA estimates for 
agricultural residues (589 PJ to 1 338 PJ) for the same 
year, when taking into account the bioenergy potential 
of residues from other crops as well. For energy crops, 
IRENA’s estimate for the potential is somewhat higher 
than what was found in the literature, which is due to 
the fact that energy crops (biodiesel from palm oil) 
already have increased significantly in recent years 
beyond the sustainable supply potential that was 
estimated historically.
One area for potential that is not included in IRENA’s 
assessment is for woody crops on surplus and marginal 
agricultural land, which could be used for the production 
of advanced biofuels. Based on existing literature, the 
potential for this category is estimated at 1 008 PJ 
to 3 321 PJ per year. Given the rapid increase in liquid 
biofuel demand and the relatively limited potential for 
sustainable energy crops, advanced biofuels from woody 
crops might present an opportunity towards meeting

bioenergy feedstock supply chain.
Supply cost
The supply cost of bioenergy feedstock in Indonesia 
is estimated to range from as low as USD 1.1 per GJ for 
agricultural processing residues, to USD 18.9 per GJ for 
wood residues and waste (see table 7). The average 
cost of supply of bioenergy in Indonesia is USD 9.7 per 
GJ, taking into account the feedstock mix. Comparing 
these supply costs with prices for fossil fuel products in 
Indonesia, a few things stand out.
First, the supply cost of energy crops from forest land 
is high compared to the subsidised price of 3 kilogram 
LPG canisters which are used by many smaller 
households for cooking. Comparing the 3 kilogram 
canister LPG prices with the (unsubsidised) 5 kilogram 
canister LPG prices also shows the extent to which they 
are subsidised (close to 60%). Without the subsidies, 
modern bioenergy cook stoves would offer a much 
better economic case to potential buyers, as would solar 
thermal collectors.
Second, steam coal prices in Indonesia are at low levels, 
but the supply cost of agro-processing residues and 
animal manure and post-consumer household waste 
are in fact lower. The use of harvesting residues, for 
which significant potential has been identified, is likely 
to be competitive when used to substitute petroleum 
products and natural gas in industry. Natural gas prices 
paid by industry are relatively high in Indonesia. It was 
reported in March 2016, for example, that the ceramics 
industry in Indonesia paid on average USD 9.1 per 
million thermal units (mBtu) for natural gas, compared 
to around USD 3.0 per mBtu in countries such as 
Singapore and Thailand (Sinaga, 2016).

the share of renewable energy in transport TFEC 
(including renewable electricity) to 18.4% (versus 
17.2% in the Reference Case).
● To assess the potential for additional renewable 
power in Indonesia, five regions (Java-Bali, 
Kalimantan, Maluku & Papua, Sulawesi & Nusa 
Tenggara and Sumatra) were distinguished, 
and for each the resource potential for different 
renewables and the projected demand for power 
in 2030 was analysed. Based on this assessment, 
the share of renewable energy in power 
generation increases to 38.3% with REmap.
● REmap Options for hydropower, geothermal, 
bioenergy power and wind power are modest, 
given their ambitious increase in the Reference 
Case and the geographical mismatch in resource 
potential and power demand. For solar PV REmap 
identifies potential for 47.2 GW of installed 
capacity by 2030, compared to 9.3 GW in the 
Reference Case. Especially in Java-Bali (which 
accounts for 70% of power demand in Indonesia) 
there is enough available space (both land and 
rooftops) and demand for power to increase the 
use of solar PV beyond the Reference Case.
● Annual investment needs for all renewables in 
the Reference Case are estimated at, on average, 
USD 9.4 billion between 2015 and 2030. With 
the REmap Options this would increase to 
USD 16.2 billion. The power sector accounts for 
USD 13.2 billion of this, nearly half of which is for 
solar PV.
● Implementing all REmap Options implies an 
average substitution cost in 2030 of USD 1.1 per GJ 
of final renewable energy, when compared to the 
annualised cost of the substituted conventional 
fuel. This is from a business perspective which 
includes taxes and subsidies on energy prices 
and a 12% discount rate. The substitution cost 
of the REmap Options in the power sector are 
negative (at USD -5.2 per GJ), as hydropower, 
geothermal power and solar PV are expected to 
Key points
● Options for additional renewable energy use 
(“REmap Options”) have been identified to 
increase the share of modern renewable energy 
to 23.3% of TFEC and 32.3% of TPES in 2030. 
This includes full substitution of traditional uses 
of bioenergy for cooking by modern cook stoves 
using bioenergy.
● Of the end-use sectors, the share of modern 
renewables is the highest in buildings at 35% 
(excluding renewable electricity), compared to 
5.9% in the Reference Case. With REmap, all 
households still relying on traditional uses of 
bioenergy for cooking in the Reference Case 
(estimated at nearly 8 million) switch to modern 
cook stoves that use solid biomass or ethanol. 
Based on an assessment of available rooftop 
space and realistic deployment potential, solar 
thermal collectors cover 30% of energy demand 
for water heating, while 5% of energy demand 
for cooling in buildings is met by solar (thermal) 
cooling.
● Through the assessment of the projected energy 
use in Indonesia’s main industry sectors and the 
supply potential of different types of bioenergy 
feedstock, the REmap Options identify 216 PJ of 
additional bioenergy use in industry. This consists 
of additional potential for the use of biogas 
(from food waste and palm oil mill effluent), 
wood residues and waste. Combined with the 
identified potential of 70 PJ per year for solar 
thermal collectors to supply process heat (in the 
rubber, food and textile industries), the share of 
renewables in industry increases to 17.9%.
● Given the high increase of liquid biofuels use 
in transport in the Reference Case, the REmap 
Options in this sector focus on electric mobility. 
With the expected continued increase in vehicle 
ownership, nearly 6% of all four-wheeled vehicles 
and 20% of all two- and three-wheelers would 
be electric by 2030. Combined, they increase be competitive with coal-fired power generation 
(which is substituted).
● From a government perspective, the average 
substitution cost reflects savings of USD -2 per GJ. 
This is due to the application of a lower discount 
rate (at 10%) and the exclusion of subsidies on 
energy prices (on residential electricity and small 
LPG canisters for low-income households).
● The REmap Options reduce the cost of Indonesia’s 
energy system in 2030 by an estimated USD 
1.7 billion per year (versus the Reference Case) 
from a government perspective. In addition, the 
savings from externalities related to outdoor 
air pollution range from USD 3 billion to USD 
9 billion per year. Reduced externalities from 
indoor air pollution account for another USD 
10.4 billion to USD 31.3 billion per year due to the 
substitution of traditional uses of bioenergy for 
cooking.
● Reduced externalities from climate change 
account for another USD 2.2 billion to 
USD 10.7 billion per year as the REmap Options 
would lead to a reduction of 150 Mt of CO2 per 
year in 2030, a reduction of 12% compared to 
the Reference Case. Reductions in CO2 emissions 
from power generation account for more than 
two-thirds of this. In sum, the REmap Options 
reduce system costs and achieve savings from 
reduced externalities of USD 17.3 billion to 
USD 53.4 billion per year in 2030. This represents 
about 0.5% to 1.7% of Indonesia’s forecasted GDP 
for 2030.
The Reference Case analysis for Indonesia utilises an 
internally developed REmap tool11 that incorporates 
the data, assumptions and approach, as summarised 
in section 4. The tool allows IRENA to enter additional 
potentials for renewable energy technologies (“REmap 
Options”) in the end-use sectors of industry, buildings 
and transport, as well as for power generation and 
district heat. The process for deriving the REmap 
Options was as follows:
1. A Reference Case was created for 2030
11 More information on the tool can be found at https://www.irena.
org/remap/REmap_energy_system_models_chapter_3_2015.pdf
2. Fuel prices were forecasted based on existing 
literature and IRENA estimates
3. Technology cost and performance criteria (e.g., 
capacity factors) were estimated to reflect 
conditions particular to Indonesia
4. Additional renewable energy options for all enduse sectors and the power sector were analysed 
based on various studies and assessments.
This chapter is divided into six subsections. Section 
6.1 describes the REmap Options for each of the 
technologies. Section 6.2 provides an overview of 
the combined impact of the REmap Options on total 
renewable energy deployed and its share in the energy 
mix, both in aggregate and per sector. In section 6.3 the 
investment needs of the REmap Options are provided, 
and in section 6.4 the cost supply curves of the REmap 
Options are provided. Finally, section 6.5 discusses the 
benefits in terms of reduced externalities, as well as the 
overall costs and benefits of the REmap Options.
6.1 Renewable energy 
technologies
Bioenergy
In 2014 most of the bioenergy use in Indonesia was 
explained by traditional cooking methods using 
fuelwood, accounting for 1 620 PJ or nearly 80% of 
the total primary demand for bioenergy that year (see 
figure 26). Another 277 PJ was used in industry, while 
transport and power generation combined represented 
less than 10% of the total demand for bioenergy demand.
The Reference Case for 2030 shows a shift, however, 
in the total use and distribution of bioenergy use in 
Indonesia. The traditional use of bioenergy for cooking 
is projected to shrink, as households increasingly are 
adopting more modern cooking methods and fuels. 
Transportation is projected to increase to more than 
40% of total primary energy demand in 2030, on the 
back of ambitious blending mandates for both ethanol 
and biodiesel (about 13 billion litres of biodiesel and 
12 billion litres of ethanol consumed per year in 2030)12. 
Bioenergy use in industry will grow by more than 
150%, particularly as a result of strong overall economic 
12 Bioenergy use in transport is assumed to have a 50% conversion 
efficiency.growth and fuel use in industry, while targets for the 
power sector imply an eight-fold increase of bioenergy 
use there. Combined, modern bioenergy use (excluding 
traditional use of bioenergy for cooking) will increase 
more than six-fold, from 436 PJ in 2014 to 2 768 PJ in 
2030.
The top part of table 8 shows an allocation of the 
demand for bioenergy in the Reference Case for various 
feedstock based on the supply potentials as presented 
in section 5.2. The bottom part of the table indicates the 
potential for each of the technologies and bioenergy 
feedstock beyond the Reference Case. The green cells 
highlight where more potential is, while red highlights 
where the resource availability poses constraints. Finally, 
orange indicates potentials, but at a higher cost.
The ambitious demand projections for bioenergy in 
the Reference Case imply constraints on the supply 
side, particularly for liquid biofuels. The potential for 
sustainable energy crops to produce first-generation 
liquid biofuels will meet less than 10% of the estimated 
demand in 2030. This implies that the remaining 90% 
would have to be provided by advanced biofuels, for 
which woody crops on surplus and marginal agricultural 
lands could be used as feedstock, or through the use 
of more degraded land and by improving yields on 
current plantations. Given these considerations, and the 
ambitious targets for liquid biofuels in the Reference 
Case, no additional REmap Options for biofuels are 
included.
Due to the constrained supply potential of agricultural 
processing and harvesting residues beyond the 
Reference Case, the REmap Options for bioenergy 
use in industry include only higher levels for the use 
of food waste, palm oil mill effluent, and wood waste 
and residue. In total the REmap Options include 216 PJ 
of additional bioenergy (final energy) consumption in 
industry. About 35% (or 75 PJ) of this is solid biomass

Source: IRENA analysisfuel use for each industrial sectors, the share that is 
expected to be supplied by bioenergy in the Reference 
Case, and the additional potential that can be realistically 
captured within the 2030 time frame. Another 35% (or 
73 PJ) of the REmap Options is in the form of additional 
use of wood residues in combined heat and power 
(CHP) in the paper industry, and another 30% (or 68 PJ) 
is from the use of biogas.
Of the REmap Options for biogas, 80% is in the form of 
biogas in CHP derived from palm oil mill effluent (POME). 
Expanding the use of POME in particular comes with 
the additional benefit of avoiding emissions that would 
occur anyway, even in the absence of combustion for 
heat or power generation. When biogas from effluent 
lagoons escapes freely into the atmosphere, not only 
is the potential energy content wasted, but methane 
with high global warming potential is released into the 
atmosphere. The additional biogas potential outside 
of POME is related to the use of food waste in CHP 
in the food processing industry. The additional CHP 
capacity relying on bioenergy is 3.9 GW, which comes 
in addition to the 7.1 GW of bioenergy for power 
generation that is included in the Reference Case for 
2030.
Based on the Reference Case, about 7.8 million 
households (about 9% of total households) in Indonesia 
would still rely on traditional uses of bioenergy for 
cooking in 2030, or 525 PJ in final energy terms. With 
the REmap Options, it is assumed that these households 
would instead use modern cook stoves. In the Reference 
Case for 2030, already 2 million households use biogas 
for cooking (up from about 15 000 today), exceeding 
the demand-side potential of 1 million households as 
explained in section 5.2. Therefore, no REmap Options 
for biogas cooking are included. Instead, with the REmap 
Options 95% of the households that would still rely on 
traditional uses of bioenergy in 2030 are assumed 
to switch to modern cook stoves using solid biomass 
(fuelwood). These modern cook stoves are up to four 
times more efficient compared with traditional cooking 
methods, reduce cooking times and mitigate indoor 
air pollution. The remaining 5% (or about 390 000 
households) are assumed to rely on ethanol gels for 
cooking, a fuel that is already used at scale in various 
African countries. Hence, with the REmap Options 11% 
(or close to 10 million households) rely on modern uses 
of bioenergy for cooking, while the remainder use LPG, 
electricity and natural gas.
Solar
The largest potential for renewable power beyond the 
Reference Case has been identified for solar PV. With 
the Reference Case 9.3 GW would be installed by 2030; 
with the REmap Options this would be 47.2 GW. This 
number is considered feasible based on the ability for 
Indonesia to ramp up annual installations (to 3.1 GW 
per year installed on average until 2030), the amount of 
available space for ground-mounted and rooftop solar 
PV, and the ability of grids to deal with the supply of 
variable renewable energy.
The share of VRE generation (including solar PV, wind 
and marine) in total generation is assumed not to exceed 
15% within any of the five regions. The latter is taken 
as an upper limit in estimating REmap Options for 
VRE in 2030. It is higher than the 10% assumption 
that the Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and 
Application of Technology (BPPT) currently uses in its 
energy modelling in Indonesia and the 10% daytime peak 
load based on PLN requirements to project developers. 
However, with planned grid developments, and based on 
the experience of other countries, it was assumed that 
15% should be feasible by 2030. In fact, grids in many 
countries are already dealing with higher shares, and the 
15% is not a binding technical boundary. Instead, given 
the limited availability of data on actual grid conditions, 
the 15% is taken as a conservative upper limit.
Most of the additional solar PV installations are assumed 
to be in Java-Bali (to reach 33.4 GW by 2030, about 
85% of the total theoretical potential for solar PV there), 
due to the resource availability close to demand centres 
and the modest share of VRE in power generation in 
the Reference Case at 4%. With the REmap Options, 
Java-Bali will have an 11% VRE share. Based on the 
assessment of available rooftop space in 2030, less 
than one-third of the installed solar PV capacity is 
estimated to be deployed in the form of rooftop solar 
PV. Commercial rooftop space in particular is more 
limited (see figure 27). Hence, 95% of rooftop solar PV 
is assumed to be installed on residential rooftops. Based 
on the projected growth in rooftop space in Indonesia, 
this implies that 10% of residential rooftops and 7% 
of commercial rooftops will be covered by solar PV in 
2030.
The potential for direct use of solar technologies in 
residential and commercial buildings in Indonesia includes applications for solar water heating and solar 
cooling. Water heating demand is projected to increase 
significantly by 2030, from an estimated 127 PJ in 2014 
to 313 PJ in 2030. This is due to increasing energy 
demand in cities and to the above-average growth in 
energy use in commercial buildings (responsible for 
25% of water heating demand in 2030). The REmap 
Options assume that 40% of water heating could be 
met by solar collectors in Indonesia by 2030, equal 
to 109 PJ of final energy consumption. This is in line 
with the business-as-usual outlook for China, which 
currently accounts for more than half of all solar water 
heating globally. Although the market for solar water 
collectors in Indonesia is not as mature as it is China, 
the solar resource in Indonesia is higher on average, 
making solar water collectors an interesting option for 
substituting petroleum products for water heating. As 
shown in figure 27, the required rooftop space amounts 
to 17.5  million m2 for residential solar water collectors 
(about 1-1.5% of total residential rooftop space in 2030) 
and 6.8 million m2 of commercial rooftops (about 6-7% 
of total commercial rooftop space in 2030).
Demand for cooling in buildings is projected to increase 
from 214 PJ in 2014 to 826 PJ in 2030, to represent 
about 28% of total energy demand in buildings. The 
implied annual increase of nearly 8% per year is in line 
with the rapid expected growth in air conditioning sales, 
which are estimated to increase 10% per year between 
2013 and 2018 (BusinessWire, 2014). Just over 70% 
of cooling demand is in commercial buildings, which 
account for nearly 80% of the increase in total cooling 
demand between now and 2030. Of the increase in 
energy demand for cooling, absorption chillers using 
hot water from solar collectors are assumed to cover 
5%. Assuming that the systems provide cooling for 
about three hours per day, this equates to 22 PJ in final 
energy terms in 2030. The total space required for these 
installations is estimated at 5 million m2, less than 1% of 
available rooftop space. Given the already significant 
increase in rooftop solar PV (for electricity generation), 
no REmap Options for stand-alone solar PV cooling are 
included.
Finally, in industry a 20% penetration rate for solar 
thermal is considered feasible by 2030 for the natural 
rubber, food and textile industries, which rely on low 
(150 °C) and medium (150-400 °C) heat. This results in 
70 PJ of substituted heat (from petroleum products) in 
the same year.

Source: IRENA analysisHydropower
Hydropower capacity will be significantly expanded in the 
Reference Case (up to 28.6 GW by 2030, from 5.2 GW in 
2014). Most of the hydropower resource potential is found 
outside Java-Bali where lower demand for electricity is a 
constraint to increasing installations. Hence, the REmap 
Options only include the additional exploitation of small 
hydropower of 1.1 GW, mainly on Sumatra, where 35% of 
the resource potential is assumed to be used by 2030 
(compared to 21% in the Reference Case).
The large hydropower resource on Java-Bali is already 
assumed to be exploited fully by 2030. This, along with 
the fact that for the other regions there are demand 
constraints as well as sustainability concerns associated 
with exploiting the resource (e.g., deforestation, 
displacement of a high number of people), explain why no 
REmap Options for large hydropower are included. Based 
on the Reference Case 19.3 GW already is assumed to be 
added between now and 2030, exceeding the estimated 
10 GW of economically feasible hydropower potential as 
explained in section 5.1. At an average expected project 
size of 150 MW (based on projects that were under 
construction or in feasibility study/planning phases in 
2015), this implies that nearly 130 projects are required to 
achieve this. Based on existing assessments of potential 
sites, these projects are likely to be distributed across 
a large number of rivers and reservoirs on the different 
islands of Indonesia (MEMR, PLN and JICA, 2011).
Geothermal
In the Reference Case, geothermal capacity is set to 
grow quickly, from 1.4 GW in 2014 to 8.9 GW in 2030. 
Beyond this ambitious projection, the REmap Options 
include 1.7 GW of additional geothermal power, to 
reach 10.6 GW of installed capacity in 2030. Java-Bali 
accounts for 800 MW of the REmap Options; Sumatra 
accounts for the remainder. As a result, 60% of the 
resource potential in Java-Bali will have been exploited 
by 2030, and 30% of the potential in Sumatra. Outside 
of these two regions, demand constraints and resource 
accessibility are assumed to limit a further increase of 
geothermal installations beyond the Reference Case.
Wind
With the REmap Options the installed capacity of wind 
power (all onshore) will reach 4.1 GW in 2030 – 45% of 
the identified potential for wind power in Indonesia. 
The addition of 1.5 GW beyond the Reference Case 
is assumed to be on Java-Bali, where the best wind 
resources have been identified and where the grid 
is most likely to be able to absorb the additional 
VRE. The additional wind power capacity can be 
considered conservative given the maturity and cost 
competitiveness of the technology. However, it is based 
on currently availability resource assessments and takes 
into account power demand limitations. Additional 
resource mapping, which is ongoing, might highlight 
additional potential in new locations.
Electric mobility
For electric mobility, significant potential beyond the 
Reference Case is identified. The REmap Options for 
electric vehicles and electric two- and three-wheelers 
amount to 13.1 TWh (or 47.3 PJ) of final energy 
consumption in 2030. Passenger and commercial 
vehicles (four-wheelers) account for nearly two-thirds 
of the total potential. Based on the expected sales of 
cars until 2030 and on a gradually increasing market 
share for electric vehicles, it is estimated that about 6% 
of the total vehicle stock in Indonesia would be electric 
in 2030. In the same year, electric vehicles would have a 
25% market share in the passenger cars segment and a 
10% market share in commercial vehicle sales.
For electric motorcycles and scooters the feasible 
penetration is higher by 2030; 20% of all two- and threewheelers could be electric by 2030 based on a roadmap 
gradually reaching a 75% market share in total two- and 
three-wheelers sales in the same year. This totals about 
42.5 million electric two- and three-wheelers on the 
road by 2030 and average sales of about 3 million of 
these between now and 2030. The case of China shows 
that this is feasible: about 200 million electric two- and 
three-wheelers were in use there in 2012, and sales are 
expected to exceed 10 million per year on average up to 
2030 (IRENA, 2014b).
Electric vehicles, scooters and motorcycles also can play 
an important role in providing energy storage. Most of 
the time they will not be used, and during this time their 
batteries have the potential to charge and discharge to 
balance the demand and variable supply of power (e.g., 
from solar PV). Based on REmap, the storage provided 
in this way amounts to 93.3 GWh per year. Total electric 
storage stands at 105.1 GWh per year; the difference is explained by 11.8 GWh per year of electric storage 
provided by batteries that are installed with rooftop 
solar PV. Although overall the electric storage capacity 
remains modest (105.1 GWh per year represents about 
0.1% of total variable power generation with REmap), 
in and around large cities where most of the electric 
mobility can be expected this could be a useful flexibility 
option.
6.2 Summary of results
With the REmap Options, the share of (modern) 
renewable energy in TPES increases to 32.3%, up from 
25.3% in the Reference Case and around 9% today. The 
renewable energy share in TFEC increases to 23.3% with 
the REmap Options (see table 9). Among the end-use 
sectors, buildings demonstrate the highest potential for 
renewable energy penetration, at 37.1% (including the 
contribution of renewable electricity). Industry is the 
second highest sector, where the REmap Options take 
the renewable energy share to 20.6% of the sector’s 
TFEC in 2030. In absolute terms, industry has the 
highest potential for renewables and represents nearly 
40% of total renewable energy use. With the addition 
of the REmap Options, 881 PJ of heat is supplied by 
bioenergy and solar thermal collectors, while another 
294 PJ is used in the form of electricity supplied by 
renewable power generation. In transport, the blending 
mandates and the additional electric vehicles with the 
REmap Options result in an 18.4% renewable share 
in the sector’s TFEC for 2030. The contribution from 
renewable electricity remains modest, at 24 PJ. In power 
generation the REmap Options imply an additional 
92 TWh of additional power generated by renewables, 
increasing the total renewable energy share to 38.3%, 
from 28.6% in the Reference Case.
Bioenergy will continue to be the dominant source of 
renewable energy in Indonesia with REmap, accounting 
for more than half of total renewable energy use in 
the country (see figure 28). The total use of bioenergy 
equates to just over 1.8 EJ, or 15% of TFEC. This 
represents an increase of 1.5 EJ from 2014, when modern 
uses of bioenergy accounted for less than 5% of TFEC. 
Hydropower is next, and contributes 308 PJ to TFEC in 
2030, up from 47 PJ in 2014.
The largest additions with the REmap Options are for 
solar energy (including both PV and thermal) (see 
figure 29). In the Reference Case, solar power supplies 
about 2% of total renewable energy use; with the 
REmap Options this would increase to 15%. Geothermal 
power increases nearly seven-fold from 2014, to about 
210 PJ or 9% of total renewable energy use in 2030. The 
contributions of marine and wind energy remain limited, 
with their combined share in total renewable energy use 
at below 3%.
Figure 30 shows the implications for the power sector 
in terms of annual installations for renewable energy 
technologies. It is obvious that compared to recent 
market trends, in both the Reference Case as well as 
with the REmap Options deployment across renewable 
technologies would need to be accelerated. With the 
REmap Options, the largest market will be for solar

47 GW of installed capacity by 2030. For the other 
technologies, the Reference Case presents an ambitious 
outlook compared to historical deployment levels, and 
the REmap Options show a more limited increase. 
For hydropower, 1.6 GW per year would need to be 
installed, up from about 300 MW per year on average in 
2011-2015. It should be noted that hydropower has been 
the only renewable technology for which a significant 
increase in capacity was witnessed in recent years. For 
geothermal power the REmap Options imply annual 
installations of 0.6 GW for installed capacity to reach 
10.6 GW by 2030. Bioenergy, marine energy and wind 
power together would account for another 1 GW annual 
market.
6.3 Investment needs
To achieve the renewable targets as included in the 
Reference Case, the required investment amounts to 
USD 9.4 billion per year in 2015-2030 (see table 11). Of 
the total, the power sector accounts for almost 85% of 
the investment required. Hydropower represents the 
largest amount at USD 2.5 billion per year, nearly onethird of overall required investment in renewable power 
capacity. Of the end-use sectors, required investment in 
the transport sector is the highest at USD 1.0 billion per 
year, the capital expenditure associated with expanding 
biofuel production capacity. Additional investments in 
industry comprise capital expenditures to achieve the 
higher levels of bioenergy use in the sector.
With the REmap Options, the required investment 
increases to USD 16.2 billion per year for the years 2015-
2030. While no additional investments are required in 
transport (electric vehicles and infrastructure are not 
included, since they do not represent direct capital 
expenditure for renewable energy), investment needs 
in industry more than double. The increase is explained 
due to identified potential for more bioenergy and solar 
thermal installations. In buildings, investment needs 
increase to USD 0.8 billion per year, of which 98% is 
explained by the identified potential for solar thermal 
water heating and cooling applications. The remaining 
2%, or about USD 222 million up to 2030, would be 
required to pay for modern cook stoves for the 8 million 
households that would still rely on traditional uses of 
bioenergy for cooking in 2030 with the Reference Case. 
Clearly, the capital intensity of modernising cooking 
across Indonesia is very low compared to achieving 
higher levels of renewable energy use in other sectors. 
Investments in renewable power would need to increase 
to USD 13.2 billion per year on average in 2015-2030 to

for both utility-scale and rooftop solar PV.
6.4 Cost of REmap Options
Table 12 provides an overview of substitution costs by 
sector for 2030 based on a business and government 
perspective. In the business perspective, a 12% discount 
rate for Indonesia is assumed and taxes and subsidies 
in energy prices are included. Given the government’s 
recent efforts to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, as 
explained in section 3.3, only subsidies on residential 
electricity prices and LPG use in households are included 
for 2030. The government perspective excludes 
taxes and subsidies in energy prices and assumes a 
standardised 10% discount rate. In both the business 
and government perspectives, the REmap Options in 
the power sector are cost-effective. Across all sectors, 
the average substitution costs for the REmap Options 
are USD 1.1 per GJ and USD -2 per GJ, respectively, 
for the business and government perspectives. The 
difference is due mainly to fossil fuel subsidies: without 
these the REmap Options are indeed viable (as shown 
by the negative substitution cost in the government 
perspective).

Source: IRENA analysisThe cost-effectiveness of the REmap Options in 
power generation is explained mainly by the cost 
competiveness of hydropower and geothermal power, 
as well as of utility-scale solar PV (see table 13). While 
geothermal and (small) hydropower already present 
low-cost opportunities in Indonesia, global cost 
reductions in solar PV are expected to continue, and 
lower specific costs for Indonesia are anticipated due to 
the scale-up of the solar market there. At the same time, 
coal prices (coal is the fuel which the renewable power 
technologies are assumed to substitute) are expected 
to increase to about USD 100 per tonne by 2030 – from 
about USD 70 per tonne in October 2016 – in line with 
the Outlook Energi Indonesia 2015 of BPPT (BPPT, 
2015). This further improves the viability of renewable 
power generation in Indonesia.
Of the end-use sectors, the REmap Options in industry 
and transport have positive substitution costs. However, 
solar thermal in industry and increased use of CHP 
provide viable solutions to further increase the share 
of renewables in industry. While the substitution cost 
for transport options (in electric mobility) are generally 
positive, it is important to realise that these calculations 
do not yet account for reductions in externalities. Taking 
into account the high associated cost of air pollution 
in many of Indonesia’s cities greatly improves their 
viability. In buildings, the displacement of subsidised 
LPG by solar thermal for water heating and modern 
cook stoves using solid biomass provide a particularly 
good business case.
Figure 31 and figure 32 rank the costs of each REmap 
Option and show their contributions to the increase 
in the share of renewable energy in the business and 
government perspective, respectively. The dark green 
bars show that in the Reference Case the share of

With the REmap Options this would further increase 
to 23.3%, whereby the substitution costs range from 
USD -67.5 per GJ to USD 32.2 per GJ in the business 
perspective, and from USD -24.5 per GJ to USD 42.6 
per GJ in the government perspective. Considering 
merely the cost-effective REmap Options would take 
the share of renewables to 21% (the end of the lightgreen bars). However, these calculations do not include 
the associated benefits of reduced air pollution and CO2
emissions, which are detailed in the next section. In the 
government perspective, this analysis shows, additional 
use of biogas, solar water heating and geothermal 
power are among the most cost-effective options to 
increase the share of renewable energy beyond the 
Reference Case.
6.5 Benefits of REmap Options
As shown in figure 33, the primary energy supply of 
fossil fuels is expected to more than double between 
2014 and 2030 in the Reference Case. Coal experiences 
the highest increase of about 4.2 EJ – from 3.1 EJ in 
2014 to 7.3 EJ in 2030 – due to its greater use in power 
generation and industry. Natural gas use increases the 
most in relative terms, rising 160% from 1.1 EJ in 2014 to 
4.2 EJ in 2030. Oil use also increases due to fast growth 
in transport energy demand, although the increase is 
somewhat more limited (+47%) due to oil’s lower share 
in meeting energy demand in power generation and 
industry.
With the REmap Options, fossil fuel demand will be cut 
by 10% compared with the Reference Case, based on a 
17% reduction in coal use and a 9% reduction in oil use. 
At the same time, traditional uses of bioenergy will be 
phased out completely, due to the uptake of modern 
cook stoves using bioenergy. Modern renewable energy 
will represent 32% of TPES, compared to 25% in the 
Reference Case.
The reduction of fossil fuel use cuts projected CO2
emissions. Based on a bottom-up estimate of the sectors 
covered in this analysis, CO2 emissions from fossil fuel 
combustion for energy services in 2014 accounted for 
584 Mt CO2/year (or about 2.3 tonnes per capita), of 
which power generation contributed nearly 40% (see 
table 14). According to the Reference Case, energyrelated CO2 emissions increase to 1 253 Mt CO2/year by 
2030, more than a doubling from 2014. The share of 
power generation increases to nearly half of the total. 
With the REmap Options, 150 Mt CO2/year are avoided, 
representing a 12% reduction from the Reference Case.

Source: IRENA analysisIn its NDC, Indonesia pledges to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions 29% by 2030 compared to a businessas-usual scenario that results in projected emissions 
of 2 869 Mt CO2-eq in the same year (UNFCCC, 2016). 
Of this, 1 669 Mt CO2-eq/year are energy-related 
emissions. To compare this to IRENA’s Reference Case 
this should be reduced by about 15%, to exclude nonCO2 greenhouse gas emissions, non-energy use and 
sectors not included in IRENA’s estimates. The resulting 
comparable level of energy-related CO2 emissions of 
1 400 Mt CO2-eq/year is higher than the 1 253 Mt CO2/
year as estimated for IRENA’s Reference Case. The 
difference is explained mainly by the assumption in 
the NDC’s business-as-usual scenario that coal is the 
main energy source for power plants and that there is 
no implementation of liquid biofuel blending mandates 
in the transport sector. In IRENA’s Reference Case, 
Indonesia’s renewable energy target for 23% in TPES by 
2025 is already included.
With the Reference Case and including the REmap 
Options, the energy-related CO2 emissions are likely 
to be below those targeted by Indonesia in the 
unconditional and conditional mitigation scenarios. The 
reduction in the unconditional mitigation scenario for 
the energy sector in Indonesia’s NDC is 314 Mt CO2-eq/
year by 2030. The emission reductions of the REmap 
Options (150 Mt CO2/year) thus account for nearly half 
of this. The conditional target of Indonesia to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions 41% by 2030 versus the 
business-as-usual scenario comes with 398 Mt CO2-eq/
year by 2030, of which the REmap Options would 
account for nearly 40%.
Reducing emissions through further energy efficiency 
improvements (see box 2) and in other sectors, 
particularly from land use, land-use change and forestry 
(LULUCF), will also be crucial. The business-as-usual 
outlook in Indonesia’s NDC does not include any energy 
efficiency improvements. Furthermore, in Indonesia’s 
business-as-usual outlook greenhouse gas emissions 
from forestry (including from peat fires) are 714 Mt 
CO2-eq/year in 2030. The reduction in the unconditional 
mitigation scenario for emissions from forestry is 497 Mt 
CO2-eq/year, higher than the ambition for reductions in 
the energy sector.
Table 15 outlines several broad financial indicators 
associated with implementation of the REmap 
Options. First, costs of the energy system would be 
reduced by USD 1.7 billion per year overall compared 
to the Reference Case. The power sector accounts 
for the largest savings (of about USD 2.1 billion per 
year) followed by cost reductions in residential and 
commercial buildings of USD 1.7 billion per year. While 
cost levels in industry and transport would be higher, it 
is important to put these into perspective given the high 
savings from reduced externalities. With the REmap 
Options about USD 16 billion to USD 52 billion per year 
would be saved from reduced externalities.
A majority of this, USD 10.4 billion to USD 31.3 billion per 
year, is related to the reduction of indoor air pollution 
caused by the traditional use of bioenergy for cooking. 
Given the relatively low level of investment required 
for implementation (as mentioned, about USD 220 
million for the required number of cook stoves), this 
presents a high-impact opportunity when externalities 
are accounted for.
Outdoor air pollution savings account for another 
USD 3 billion to USD 9.7 billion per year. About 
USD 0.9 billion to USD 3.7 billion per year of this is 
related to reduced air pollution due to electric mobility.

Source: IRENA analysisGiven that the additional costs to the transport energy 
cost are USD 0.9 billion per year, this illustrates the 
viability of the REmap Options for electric mobility. 
Finally, reduced CO2 emissions imply additional savings 
of USD 2.4 billion to USD 11.2 billion per year. This is 
based on a value of CO2 of between USD 17 and USD 80 
per tonne (IRENA, 2016a).
To implement the REmap Options, the incremental 
government support needs are estimated at 
USD 3.7 billion per year in 2030. This is a substantial 
amount, but it is small in comparison to the overall 
USD 17.3 to USD 53.4 billion per year in reduced energy 
system costs and externalities that come with the REmap 
Options. This represents about 0.5% to 1.7% of Indonesia’s 
forecasted GDP for 2030, which is estimated to reach 
USD 3.7 trillion by that year (IHS, 2016). The additional 
jobs created in the renewable energy sector as well as 
the positive externalities related to capacity building and 
technology transfer come in addition to these benefits.

Box 2: Synergies between renewable energy and energy efficiency
Energy intensity in Indonesia has been declining in recent years. Between 1990 and 2010 the decline in energy 
intensity (defined as primary energy use in MJ / GDP PPP in USD) was -0.9% per year; between 2010 and 2012 
it accelerated further to -5.1% per year (IEA and World Bank, 2015). Until 2025, Indonesia targets an annual 
change of -1% in energy intensity, as per the National Energy Conservation Master Plan (which is currently 
being updated).
In the Reference Case, energy intensity will further decrease between 2014 and 2030 by -2.5% per year. While 
primary energy supply will continue to increase (by 5% per year), the projected growth in real GDP of 7.7% per 
year (as per the Outlook Energi Indonesia 2014) implies that there is a significant reduction in energy used per 
unit of GDP. With the REmap Options, energy intensity will change by -2.9% per year over the same period, 
due to the lower primary energy supply as a result of additional renewable energy in the mix. In general 
renewables come with a higher conversion efficiency compared with their conventional counterparts and 
thus contribute to Indonesia’s targets for reducing energy intensity as well.
However, more potential for improving energy efficiency exists in the long run. In the Outlook Energi 
Indonesia 2015, a high-efficiency scenario (which also includes significantly more renewables) indicates the 
potential for the change in energy intensity to be -3.1% per year until 2030 (MEMR, 2016h). These additional 
energy efficiency improvements and conservation efforts can further contribute to lowering CO2 emissions 
and putting Indonesia on its NDC path. Accelerating the deployment of renewable energy thus should be 
complemented by driving energy efficiency improvements.7 BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
RENEWABLE ENERGY UPTAKE
of installed capacity. In the isolated grid systems such 
as West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan and many 
others, grid sizes are much smaller, and these also 
often include much older power plants. In addition, 
generation forecasting or requirements for centralised 
monitoring and access to power plants are limited at the 
moment. This means that it will be difficult to increase 
the penetration of variable renewables in the grid in the 
short term.
Another bottleneck is PLN’s distribution system, which 
is unlikely to be able to accommodate high amounts 
of distributed solar PV power without additional 
investments. For rooftop PV systems this could pose 
challenges, as connecting to the transmission substation 
is unusual at present and might come with significant 
additional cost. At the same time, the fact that solar 
power is available when the demand for air conditioning 
is high might reduce pressure on the grid in times of 
high demand. For wind power preliminary results from 
a grid impact study for Sulawesi suggest that there 
might be less capacity to interconnect than initially 
thought. South Sulawesi was selected by many project 
developers due to the relatively inexpensive land cost, 
the fairly sizeable grid and expected growth in power 
consumption, and because it has one of the highest 
wind resources in Indonesia.
PLN issues an annual document called the Electricity 
Supply Business Plan (RUPTL) that outlines in detail 
the long-term plans for generation, distribution and 
transmission growth. In many cases the document 
includes specific projects, especially for generation 
projects above 10 MW and for transmission projects. 
Distribution planning and generation projects below 
10 MW generally are done by regional PLN offices and fall 
fully under their authority. While the plan is detailed and 
includes specific figures for geothermal and hydropower 
capacity by location, it does not provide this level of 
detail for the other renewable energy technologies. 
Furthermore, as shown in table 3, the renewable energy 
targets included for 2025 are significantly below those 
set by MEMR. This implies that current long-term 
7.1 Barriers and opportunities in 
the power sector
By 2030, power generation capacity in Indonesia is set 
to increase to 199.3 GW, up from 57.6 GW at the end 
of 2014. Renewable power capacity in the Reference 
Case will be 61 GW, compared to just 8.4 GW today. 
With the REmap Options, the renewable energy power 
capacity would increase further to 107 GW by 2030. 
Several barriers are currently holding back growth for 
renewable power in Indonesia, while other challenges 
are anticipated to arise in implementing the REmap 
Options. These barriers, as well as opportunities to 
mitigate them, are grouped into key topics of: grid 
integration, cost recovery for PLN, off-grid deployment, 
project financing, and land acquisition and community 
involvement. These are discussed below, after which 
technology-specific barriers and opportunities are 
discussed for solar PV, hydropower, geothermal power, 
bioenergy power, marine energy and wind power.
Grid integration
Indonesia’s electrical grid system is fragmented, given 
the archipelagic nature of the country. More than 600 
isolated grid systems are in operation, not including 
the smaller grids supplying small cities and villages. 
Many of the large cities located on the same island 
still operate on independent and isolated grids. The 
relatively small size of the grids, even when they serve 
cities with significant population, limits how much VRE 
(solar, wind, marine energy) can be installed. Today, a 
limit of 10% VRE penetration from the daytime peak 
load is imposed by PLN to ensure grid stability. With 
this requirement, the potential for VRE is limited, both 
in terms of plant size and in terms of the number of 
suitable locations.
Because of the number of isolated grid systems as 
well as the grid sizes, it is difficult to generalise the 
grid condition and to create a policy or a plan that 
works well across all regions. The largest grid system 
at present is the Java-Bali system, with about 40 GW grid plans of PLN are not designed for achieving the 
ambitions of REmap, or even the Reference Case.
Finally, current procurement strategies (such as high 
contracted hours from non-renewable IPP generations, 
take-or-pay gas supply contracts, and diesel equipment 
rental contracts) discourage dispatch strategies that 
favour renewable energy generation. These contracting 
strategies result in dispatch merit orders that are likely 
to curtail renewable energy generation.
Opportunities
● Targets for renewable power technologies 
should be aligned between PLN and MEMR. 
Detailed plans for individual grids and their 
potential to absorb VRE are recommended 
given the fragmented nature of Indonesia’s 
electricity system. PLN will need to incorporate 
specifically in its plans the expected increase in 
VRE by technology and location, and also could 
consider developing a plan for transmission and 
distribution requirements across locations for 
a case of high VRE uptake, such as the one 
suggested by REmap.
● Important for VRE integration is developing 
sound market conditions as well as grid 
management practices and dispatch strategies 
that incorporate the concept of spinning reserves 
based on generation forecasting of VRE power 
plants. In the short term, VRE power plants could 
be required to submit 48-hour, 36-hour and 
24-hour generation forecasts. These reports can 
then be used to plan PLN’s dispatch orders so 
that there is always available spinning reserve.
● PLN could introduce a different procurement 
strategy that will take advantage of cost savings 
of the use of renewable energy sources and that 
provides for priority dispatch of VRE. Contracts 
with non-renewable IPPs could be more flexible 
instead of locking in a high number of contracted 
hours. In general, PLN needs to integrate its 
procurement strategies with system planning 
and grid management protocols to allow for the 
prioritisation of renewable energy use.
● The addition of energy storage can help stabilise 
the grid while incorporating higher levels of VRE. 
Residential and commercial storage options 
can be implemented with appropriate support 
mechanisms, as has been done in various other 
countries (e.g., Germany). The potential for more 
electric vehicles and electric two- and threewheelers and being able to use them as energy 
storage provides another solution. Vehicleto-grid technology can be implemented for 
grid-stabilising storage as well as time-shifting 
storage.
● Capacity building with relevant stakeholders (in 
particular PLN) in Indonesia for how to plan for 
an electricity system with higher levels of VRE 
in the grid is recommended. The Danish Energy 
Agency (DEA) and the United States Agency 
for International Development – Indonesia Clean 
Energy Development (USAID-ICED) project 
have already started this effort. DEA is currently 
conducting a study on wind power integration 
into the power system, to address challenges 
concerning the integration of VRE and to make 
detailed recommendations on, for example, 
required changes to policies and regulations. 
USAID-ICED is conducting a specific study of 
the South Sulawesi grid to incorporate a planned 
200+ MW of wind power plants (USAID, 2015).
Cost recovery for PLN
Another major issue today relates to the costs to PLN 
that come with renewable energy projects. Currently, 
PLN has two main sources of income: payments from 
consumers and government compensation for subsidies 
to consumers reflected in lower electricity prices. No 
additional compensation is provided to PLN for the 
feed-in tariffs for renewable energy projects, which 
generally exceed the electricity prices that PLN charges 
to consumers. The compensation to PLN for subsidies 
to electricity consumers is calculated based on the 
difference between the (subsidised) prices and the 
estimated production cost for PLN (which includes 
generation, transmission and distribution, and overhead 
cost). This compensation is a legal term specified in 
the Ministry of Finance’s regulation and has a specific 
methodology for calculations; it currently cannot be 
used to cover PLN’s additional costs for mandated 
renewable energy feed-in tariffs. Furthermore, PLN is 
under pressure to lower its dependency on income from 
this compensation and to reduce its overall production cost base. These dynamics limit PLNs ability to sign 
PPAs for renewable projects under existing feed-in tariff 
programmes.
As mentioned in section 2.1, PLN also is negotiating PPA 
agreements directly with developers, mainly for largerscale projects. While there is a document from PLN that 
outlines this process, it is still lacking in describing the 
requirements for different stages of the development 
process (PLN, 2013). As an example, one of the steps 
is called “Proposal Evaluation”, but the document does 
not mention what the criteria are for projects to move to 
the next stage in the process. For the required feasibility 
studies a suggested table of contents is provided, but 
no specific criteria beyond this are outlined.
Furthermore, part of the project approval process by 
PLN includes a financial viability assessment, where the 
return on equity to investors is capped at 14%. If the 
outcome of the assessment is that the PPA is higher 
than the current production cost at the site, then PLN’s 
recommendation to MEMR is to conditionally reject the 
project. This recommendation includes the additional 
costs that will be required to cover the gap between 
the required tariff and the cost of generation. If MEMR 
then agrees to fund the gap, PLN will accept the project, 
although as of now it is not clear where the funds will 
come from.
Opportunities
● A new scheme or fund is recommended for 
renewable energy projects that covers the gap 
between the mandated renewable energy feedin tariffs and the revenues that PLN receives 
from consumers. This would allow for PLN to 
purchase more renewable energy through feedin tariff regulations. Feed-in tariffs need to be 
high enough to attract early investors, while PLN 
needs assurance that the additional costs will be 
borne by the government. Setting up this fund 
should involve not only PLN and MEMR, but also 
the Ministry of Finance.
● The process for PLN to negotiate agreements 
directly with developers for renewable energy 
projects should be more standardised. Detailed 
requirements for feasibility and interconnection 
studies should be provided to ensure that projects 
meet standards while streamlining what different 
developers submit. It also should be clarified 
where funding will come from and in what time 
frame, to reduce uncertainty in the market. As 
long as the process is clear and transparent, this 
will allow more renewable energy projects to be 
developed and implemented at an appropriate 
tariff and reduces the issue of cost recovery to 
PLN.
● A consumer tariff structure based on the level 
of electricity consumption could be considered, 
with higher prices for larger users. This would 
encourage larger energy users both to implement 
energy efficiency measures and to use renewable 
energy (such as rooftop solar PV) to reduce their 
grid energy consumption.
Off-grid deployment
There are significant opportunities for off-grid 
deployment of renewables in rural areas, as over 12 000 
villages are currently not yet electrified. In the Reference 
Case, it is assumed that 2.1 GW of additional solar PV 
mini-grids will be installed through active efforts by the 
government and PLN to provide electricity to 1.1 million 
households, in addition to about 300 MW of off-grid 
and mini-grids based on hydropower. Remote areas 
in Maluku & Papua and Sulawesi & Nusa Tenggara 
represent a majority of planned deployment.
In achieving this ambitious target, the lack of bankable 
off-takers represents a key barrier. While some project 
developers might be willing to accept tariff payments 
directly from communities, this would come with 
challenges related to economic viability, given the high 
number of fragmented un-electrified villages with low 
levels of demand and because people are unable to 
pay the electricity price that is required to cover capital 
expenditures and operational expenses.
Several hundred solar PV- and micro-hydro-based 
micro-grids have been installed in Indonesia in recent 
years. This has been the result of several programmes, 
including innovative uses of public-private partnerships, 
that have been supported by international organisations, 
foreign governments and various Indonesian ministries 
and agencies. This has led to an active market for micro 
hydro where communities, local private fabricators and 
equipment suppliers have formed an ecosystem for 
sustaining a market. However, issues have emerged as well. Some systems experienced failures within a 
short time of commissioning. Despite efforts by the 
German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) 
to train many of the villages in the basic O&M of the 
systems, there is still a lack of capacity in being able to 
troubleshoot and fix more complicated failures.
Furthermore, as communities get access to electricity, 
their consumption is likely to increase. Often this can be 
significant, as each household might add more electrical 
equipment such as fans, televisions and refrigerators. 
This brings about issues related to the scaling of off-grid 
solutions and has resulted in discrepancies between the 
size of the power system installed and the increasing 
local energy demand over time. Further scaling capacity 
might be challenging for micro hydro in particular, 
whereas for solar PV this is less of an issue.
Finally, in many cases, the public grid will eventually 
arrive and the community is faced with a choice between 
the micro-grid and the public grid. In many countries 
this has posed challenges to the continued financial 
viability of the micro-grid, as villages have an incentive 
to connect to the main grid instead if this comes with 
lower electricity prices (IRENA, 2015c, 2016e).
Opportunities
● Increasing PLN’s Public Service Obligation 
budgets to build and own distribution networks 
in the locations where off-grid projects are 
implemented could be considered. These 
budgets are now typically used for grid extension 
projects to reach currently un-electrified 
communities. However, a significant portion 
of an off-grid project’s capital expenses come 
from installing the distribution network and the 
household connections. If PLN is able to provide 
the funding or even to build the distribution 
network and household connections, this can 
reduce the capital investment required by project 
developers.
● To further improve the business case of off-grid 
renewables to project developers, establishing 
larger off-grid working areas or concession 
areas that encompass multiple villages could 
be considered. The concession areas could be 
determined by PLN and MEMR and could provide 
project developers with the first right of refusal 
to supply electricity for this area. This allows for 
lower system installation cost, while also allowing 
for the latest technologies to be used that are 
only economically viable at scale.
● There is a need for an entity that is responsible 
for overseeing the continuing O&M of the system, 
including troubleshooting and component 
replacement. It is important that local community 
members are involved, for example to perform 
basic O&M. Local engineers and technicians 
from the regions could be trained to provide 
support on more complicated troubleshooting 
and operational issues.
● Standardised survey methodologies to design 
off-grid systems on a community level are 
recommended. A standard energy needs 
requirement survey and a resource assessment 
survey will need to be performed on each 
community and incorporated in key design 
elements (for example, size and technology) of 
the off-grid system. Expected additional growth 
in electricity consumption should be factored 
into the design of systems and technology 
choice, as certain technologies are more flexible 
to scale up (e.g., solar PV) than others (e.g., 
micro hydro).
● To avoid stranded micro-grid assets, the 
strengthening of regulatory frameworks to allow 
for integration of mini-grids with the public 
grid should be considered. One approach could 
be to introduce a concession model, where 
developers can obtain a concession for a number 
of years of operation, within which all assets are 
depreciated. Should the grid arrive before assets 
are fully depreciated then the developers are 
guaranteed compensation at a pre-determined 
level (IRENA, 2015c). Other options should be 
considered as well to increase participation of 
the private sector, such as including multiple exit 
options on arrival of the grid, in line with recent 
draft guidelines for micro-grids in India (MNRE, 
2016).
Project finance
In general, financing costs are high in Indonesia, and 
this presents another challenge for renewable energy projects which typically come with long-term PPAs. The 
typical commercial cost of capital in Indonesia is higher 
than 10% for the local currency, and also for USD- or 
Euro-based lending. This results in a relatively high PPA 
tariff to ensure that the projects are financially viable to 
investors. At present, larger projects are funded through 
foreign equity and lending institutions, often through 
development funds and private equity. Recently, the 
government has indexed many of its latest renewable 
energy tariff regulations to the USD, which helps in 
making projects more accessible to funds that are 
USD-based.
With the increase in recent years in international climate 
funds, significant additional capital should be available 
through these channels for renewable energy projects 
in Indonesia. The primary barrier holding back the 
use of these funds is the current lack of bankable 
projects. Most funds will only finance projects with 
signed PPAs, and few projects with signed PPAs are 
currently available (due in part to cost recovery issues 
for PLN, as discussed above). This also is due to the 
lack of project development equity to properly develop 
projects with high-quality site surveys, pre-feasibility 
studies, grid interconnection studies and other crucial 
steps to reach a signed PPA.
In addition to the high cost of capital, for both equity 
and loans, there is a shortage of local project financing 
capacity. Efforts are under way to train local bankers 
(through programmes of, for example, DIE and ACE), by 
using learnings from projects in Thailand and Malaysia. 
However, banks in Indonesia still have only a few people 
assigned as assessors of renewable energy projects. 
For smaller projects, the types of local financing that 
are available are mostly collateral-based. In some cases, 
the project sponsor’s balance sheet is the collateral, 
effectively becoming corporate loans.
Opportunities
● Further strengthening local project finance 
capabilities will be an important step for the 
accelerated deployment of renewables. 
Increasing awareness at commercial banks 
about the opportunities, as well as providing 
clear signals from the government regarding 
long-term support for renewables, could help 
banks to assign more resources to renewable 
energy project finance.
● Creating a standard procedure and performance 
indicators for project development documents 
will be important to ensure that projects can 
be financed. In addition, providing funds for 
project development (e.g., in the form of 
convertible loans) could vastly increase project 
development activities in Indonesia, which would 
increase the utilisation of international climate 
funds for renewable energy projects. Careful 
consideration will have to be made to ensure that 
the deliverables of the project development phase 
meet international standards and industry best 
practices, while developers need to be accountable 
and transparent about the cost incurred.
● Alternatively, providing government loan 
guarantees for larger projects could be 
considered to lower risk to investors (IRENA, 
2016f). This could be especially interesting for 
projects/ technologies where the lack of project 
financing is a main bottleneck. Once successful 
projects have materialised the need for loan 
guarantees will decrease.
Land acquisition and community involvement
Many renewable energy technologies require relatively 
large areas of land, which is especially the case for 
solar PV projects. However, there are still issues around 
legal land ownership. Recently, for example, the Jakarta 
government questioned the purchase of land from a 
private owner and later found that it already owned the 
land since the 1960s (Anya, 2016). In more-rural areas 
where documentation and administration are still not 
electronically processed and recorded, it is even more 
difficult to track land ownership.
The cost of land can be a significant portion of the project 
cost. Regions where the grid can accept more VRE 
typically are relatively more economically developed, 
such as Java. Therefore, land costs in Java are significantly 
higher than in Papua, for example. However, in Papua, 
the potential for VRE is relatively more limited due to 
constraints on the demand side. These considerations 
are not reflected in current feed-in tariff regulations for 
renewables, which generally are lower for projects in, for 
example, Java than in more remote locations.
Also, local communities play a large role in the land 
acquisition process, and it can take a long time for project developers to obtain the required land. There 
also have been reports of asking prices for land going 
up significantly when developers make clear their 
intention to develop the land for projects. Community 
involvement therefore is an important part of the 
development process.
Opportunities
● Cost-of-land differences across different 
locations in Indonesia could be reflected more 
in feed-in tariffs. Alternatively, the government 
can take a more active role in providing lands, 
especially in locations with a large potential 
for renewables (such as Java and Sumatra). 
Specific plots of (non-productive) lands could 
be acquired and provided for renewable energy 
projects, ideally with interconnection points 
on-site as well as pre-approved environmental 
impact assessments. This would reduce not 
only the land acquisition cost, but also the 
interconnection cost, and would simplify the 
permitting process.
● Local communities need to be involved early in 
the project development phase by engaging with 
the community leaders and local government. 
Whenever possible, local community members 
should be employed by the project. Also, 
providing additional services on behalf of the 
project to the surrounding communities – 
such as additional electricity, clean water and 
sanitation facilities – will be important to increase 
community buy-in and increase the probability of 
acquiring land. Existing agricultural lands could 
allow for the addition of solar panels and wind 
turbines on-site, increasing revenues to local 
farmers and reducing land acquisition issues.
Technology-specific barriers and 
opportunities
Beyond the above-mentioned barriers that apply to all 
renewable energy technologies, there are additional 
barriers that relate to specific technologies. An overview 
of these barriers and opportunities is provided in 
table 16.
Table 16: Technology-specific barriers and opportunities in the power sector
Technology Barriers Opportunities
Solar PV ● Complicated permitting procedures for 
ground-mounted projects add to project 
development cost
● A net metering system for rooftop solar PV 
is in place, but no compensation is provided 
beyond (future) own consumption, and a 
minimum payment is charged each month 
for having a grid connection
● Simplify permitting procedures for groundmounted systems
● Provide additional compensation to excess 
electricity sold to the grid from rooftop 
systems (e.g., allow for payment of the 
minimum monthly charge through the credit 
mechanism)
Hydropower ● Project-specific issues relate to access to 
the project site, environmental impact and 
social issues, catchment area protection, as 
well as water rights management
● Historical data are often lacking at a 
regional level; in many locations there are 
no flow data or flood and groundwater 
data beyond the last 5-10 years
● Hydropower projects are planned involving 
different levels of government, while 
advantages of hydropower projects to 
local communities might not be optimally 
communicated
● Strengthen capacity with local companies to 
ensure that studies are based on industry best 
practice and are bankable for project finance
● The Indonesian Meteorological Agency 
(BMKG) could install additional monitoring 
equipment and collect information regularly. 
These data could be made openly available to 
any project developer to be used as the basis 
for project assessment
● Highlight the large opportunity for local 
employment and industry creation to local 
authorities to increase local interestTechnology Barriers Opportunities
Bioenergy ● High administrative costs and permitting 
procedures make it challenging for industry 
to interconnect bioenergy power to the 
grid
● Potential producers often do not consider 
bioenergy power generation as part of 
their core business and/or are not aware 
of the potential for bioenergy power to 
reduce fossil fuel consumption, limiting the 
deployment of bioenergy capacity
● The feed-in tariff for biomass power 
projects currently does not apply to 
projects larger than 10 MW, which reduces 
the potential for producers that do intend 
to connect to the grid to reach economies 
of scale
● Reduce permitting procedures and 
administrative costs for interconnection of 
bioenergy power generation by industry
● Increase awareness among industries about 
the potential that bioenergy offers and 
stimulate the use of CHP-based bioenergy
● MEMR could consider increasing the maximum 
size of bioenergy power projects to qualify for 
the feed-in tariff to beyond 10 MW to allow for 
economies of scale to reduce generation cost
Geothermal 
power
● High upfront exploration cost and risk are 
associated with projects
● Geothermal tenders have often attracted 
unqualified bidders, which delayed the 
execution of projects
● Approvals from the Geothermal Fund 
Facility (GFF) for exploration or projects 
have been very limited to date
● Engage in knowledge and capacity building 
with relevant stakeholders to ensure that 
projects can be implemented within budget 
and on time
● The GFF needs to be able to allow projects 
with a higher risk profile to be eligible for 
funding
● Other options include government guarantees 
(on loans), or developing a revolving 
fund sharing the cost of the exploration 
and discovery/confirmation stages of a 
geothermal project
Marine 
energy
● The realistic deployment potential for the 
different types of marine energy around 
the many islands of Indonesia is not fully 
understood as of yet, also taking into 
account the availability of local grids and 
estimated project costs
● Marine energy is an emerging technology 
without a mature global market, posing 
technology risks to achieving the targets in 
the 2030 time frame
● Expand assessment of the resource potential 
and economic deployment potential of marine 
energy in the short and long terms; identify 
separately the potential for smaller-scale (offgrid) projects and larger-scale projects
● Focus on smaller-scale projects close to land 
first to build local capacity and demonstrate 
the technology potential
● Consider expanding R&D efforts with a focus 
on developing innovative applications of 
marine energy for remote communities (such 
as water pumping, desalination, ice making)
continued on next page7.2 Barriers and opportunities in 
the end-use sectors
Buildings
The REmap Options indicate the potential for solar 
thermal collectors to meet 40% of solar water heating 
energy demand by 2030. Solar thermal collectors for 
water heating are already very popular in other parts 
of Asia, most notably in China. In Indonesia, limited 
awareness among building owners and a lack of design 
standards are seen as main barriers to deployment. 
Solar cooling technologies (both active and passive) 
hold potential towards meeting the rapidly growing 
demand for air conditioning in urban areas, but 
awareness among building owners of its potential is 
currently lacking in Indonesia.
Opportunities
● Additional efforts to capture the potential of solar 
water heating by national and local governments 
are needed, for example through the inclusion 
in building codes. Many cities around the world 
already have in place solar thermal ordinances 
that require new buildings – especially larger 
ones – to install collectors.
● As the global market for solar cooling is at a 
more nascent stage, stimulating demonstration 
projects on commercial and public buildings to 
create awareness of its local potential would be 
advisable. For residential buildings, where the 
cooling demand is generally smaller, a separate 
programme is needed.
Industry
In industry the REmap Options consist of solar thermal 
and the additional use of bioenergy for process heat 
(discussed in section 7.3). For solar thermal the potential 
is mainly in the natural rubber, food and textile industries 
that are characterised by low-temperature process 
heat. While these industries are less energy-intensive 
per plant, in aggregate they represent large energyconsuming industries that rely on low and medium 
heat for their processes, particularly suitable for solar 
thermal. The total potential for solar thermal heating 
in industry is estimated at 70 PJ, representing 20% 
of the total energy use for heat in above-mentioned 
Technology Barriers Opportunities
Wind power ● There is no feed-in tariff for wind power, 
and projects under way have been 
negotiated directly with PLN. Without a 
transparent competitive bidding process 
in place, potential issues (e.g., not selecting 
the best parties for projects and/or at a 
price that is too high) could get worse as 
the availability of good sites (i.e., with wind 
speeds above 5 metres per second near 
grids with significant load) is limited
● Some developers are investing significantly 
in project development efforts in 
Indonesia – such as the installation of 
meteorological instrument masts – without 
a clear understanding of the risk/rewards. 
This could lead to disappointment in 
the future if projects are not awarded to 
these companies, and could reduce overall 
interest in the Indonesian market
● Consider including wind power in feed-in 
tariff programmes. Alternatively, introduce 
auction schemes that are transparent, simple 
and fair to increase the confidence of project 
developers*
● Provide developers with a clear understanding 
of upcoming project opportunities and 
transparency on the process for selecting 
winners
* For an analysis of auction design options, best practices on implementation, and policy recommendations, see http://www.irena.org/
DocumentDownloads/Publications/IRENA_RE_Auctions_Guide_2015_2_policies.pdfindustries. Similar to the residential and commercial 
segments, limited awareness of the potential for solar 
collectors to supply heat for industrial processes poses 
a significant barrier. While the demand for heating in 
industry is continuous, solar thermal collectors provide 
an intermittent supply of energy. For existing plants, 
space limitations might pose another barrier, especially 
if the buildings are not able to accommodate collectors 
on their rooftops or if there is no sufficient on-site area.
Opportunities
● A specific programme to build local awareness 
and capacity, particularly highlighting the 
potential for solar thermal energy to substitute 
costly petroleum products, is needed. In turn, this 
could improve the competitiveness of Indonesia’s 
industry. Local demonstration projects would be 
a good option to consider as a first step.
● Consider solar thermal storage capacity and/or 
hybrid solutions (with fossil fuels) in the design 
and construction of new industrial plants. For 
existing plants, concentrated solar thermal (CST) 
solutions can be an option given that they use 
less space, but that will depend on whether there 
is demand for higher-temperature steam and 
on the cost of the incumbent, since CST is often 
more expensive.
Transport
The ambitious blending mandates for ethanol (20%) and 
biodiesel (30%) for 2025 onwards currently dominate 
the Indonesian outlook for renewables in transport 
(further elaborated in the next section). However, 
electric vehicles and two- and three-wheelers provide 
major opportunities that are currently unaddressed. 
With the REmap Options the potential by 2030 for 
6% of the vehicle stock and 20% of all motorcycles 
and scooters to be electric has been identified, based 
on the expectation of a rapid continued increase in 
vehicle penetration. In remote areas and islands, electric 
vehicles and electric two- and three-wheelers are good 
solutions given the relatively short travelling distances. 
In larger cities electric mobility can play an important 
role in mitigating air pollution. However, at present the 
infrastructure is lacking to support the increased use of 
electric mobility, and only a few companies sell electric 
cars, scooters and motorcycles.
Opportunities
● To accelerate the uptake of electric vehicles 
and electric two- and three-wheelers, several 
actions should be considered. Infrastructure 
investments, such as charging infrastructure for 
electric vehicles and electric two- and threewheelers at large parking lots in cities, should 
be combined with support policies (e.g., tax 
incentives to reduce the cost of electric vehicles) 
to kick-start the market. This could happen at the 
national government level, but also at the local 
government or city level, as has been the case in 
many countries around the world.
● To maximise the potential of localisation benefits 
(such as job creation and human capital building), 
the domestic industry should be involved early 
on. Indeed, almost as many cars, motorcycles and 
scooters are produced and sold in Indonesia every 
year (ASEAN Automotive Federation, 2016). 
Incentivising local industry with the production 
of electric vehicles, motorcycles and scooters 
for the local market could be an effective way to 
achieve faster market growth.
7.3 Ensuring the sustainable use of 
bioenergy
Bioenergy plays a major role in Indonesia’s energy 
system across all sectors – primarily in the form of 
liquid biofuels in transport, waste and residues for 
process heat in industry – and it is used by many 
households for cooking. Indonesia’s rich endowment of 
bioenergy resources provides significant opportunities 
for reducing fossil fuel use and adding economic value. 
However, barriers on both the supply and demand side 
will have to be addressed for the potential to be used in 
a sustainable way.
Supply side
Biodiesel
The blending mandates that are targeted for 2025 
onwards (E20 and B30) are assumed to materialise 
in the Reference Case, resulting in the need for about 
25 billion litres of liquid biofuels (13 billion litres of 
biodiesel and 12 billion litres of ethanol) in 2030, based on projections for total gasoline and diesel use. These 
ambitious policies will significantly reduce fossil fuel 
dependence in transport.
Indonesia has a long history in the production of 
biodiesel. In 2015 less than 1 billion litres of biodiesel 
was blended but the expectation for 2016 is that this 
could increase to 3.2 billion litres. Biodiesel is currently 
produced at scale from palm oil. However, based on 
the assessment of the sustainable bioenergy supply 
potential, there is no potential for energy crops (palm 
oil, but also other crops) on suitable lands (as per 
the FAO definition) beyond those that are currently 
used. This is because forests cover large parts of the 
remaining suitable land (and are excluded) and because 
agricultural lands are expected to expand to meet the 
increasing demand for other crops. With the expected 
yield increase of 0.7% per year for palm oil up to 
2030, the implied supply potential (162 PJ) in that year 
translates into 2.5 billion litres of biodiesel, below the 
expected production level of biodiesel for 2016. To 
meet the growing demand for biodiesel from palm oil 
in Indonesia, two sources of additional production are 
considered: using degraded lands and further increasing 
yield improvements.
There is a lot of degraded land in Indonesia, with 
estimates ranging between 12 Mha and 74 Mha 
depending on different definitions and suitability 
criteria (Wicke et al., 2008). In recent years, more 
region-specific studies have shed new light on the 
specific potential for energy crops on such lands. For 
degraded lands suitable for palm oil, between 0.5 Mha 
and 7 Mha of land in West and Central Kalimantan 
was identified. The wide range is due to the degree 
of suitability and sustainability criteria (WRI, 2012). 
Another study on North and East Kalimantan found 
the potential for an additional 0.7 Mha to 1.0 Mha 
from responsible land zoning and potential agricultural 
development on underutilised lands (Van der Laan 
et al., 2016). At the low end of the range (with a 
higher probability of ensuring sustainable practices) 
this implies about 1.2 million Mha of potentially suitable 
degraded lands on Kalimantan for palm oil production. 
At current average yields of 3 tonnes of crude palm oil 
per hectare per year (t CPO/ha/year), this theoretically 
could be used to produce about 3 billion additional 
litres of biodiesel from palm oil. Additional potential for 
degraded lands is likely to exist on Indonesia’s other 
islands as well, mainly on Papua and Sumatra.
While degraded lands certainly provide opportunities, 
barriers exist to fully utilise degraded lands for biofuel 
production, especially within the 2030 time frame. The 
degraded lands often are scattered plots of less than 
1 000 ha each, which is below the required 5 000 ha 
required for one palm oil mill. Without economies of 
scale, this reduces the economic viability to larger 
plantations and limits their interest in exploiting these 
lands. The regulatory frameworks and capacity to 
implement at the district level also are reported to 
be insufficient for the sustainable use of many of 
the degraded lands, especially with concerns over 
land-use rights. Furthermore, there is competition 
over these degraded lands with other crops, most 
notably rubber and rice, for which demand is also 
growing fast.
Improving yields will be important to increase the 
production of palm oil based on lands currently in use. 
Yields have already improved in various locations in 
recent years through replanting and improved practices. 
On average, yields in Indonesia are currently around 
3 t CPO/ha/yr, although a big difference in average 
yields exists between smallholders – about 2 t CPO/
ha/yr – and large holders – at about 5 t CPO/ha/yr. A 
yield of 5.7 t CPO/ha/yr was observed on plots with 
best-management practices on six plantations across 
Sumatra and Kalimantan between 2006 and 2011 (IFC, 
2013). If by 2030 all palm oil plantations would be 
achieving a yield of 5.7 t CPO/ha/yr – instead of the 3.3 t 
CPO/ha/yr in the baseline projection based on an annual 
yield increase of 0.7% – an additional 27 million tonnes 
of crude palm oil could be produced per year. If, for 
example, half of this would be used for the production 
of biodiesel, an additional 12.8 billion litres of biodiesel 
could be supplied.
This shows why the further increase of yields has a 
lot of potential. However, increasing average yields 
to this level, especially by 2030, would come with 
challenges. Reaching the large number of smallholders, 
where most of the potential to increase yields exists, 
will be a first challenge. Although exact estimates on 
the number of smallholders are unavailable, there 
could be as many as 1.4 million in operation today 
(Rainforest Alliance, 2016). Combined they account 
for about 40% of the total production of palm oil in 
Indonesia. If they all could be reached, convincing them 
all to implement different practices would be cost- and 
time-intensive. Also, improving yields will come with funding requirements, and many smallholders have 
limited access to finance and are unlikely to be able to 
cover the upfront investment.
Ethanol
There exists large potential to scale up the production of 
ethanol in Indonesia. Ethanol is currently produced at a 
small scale in Indonesia, despite the blending mandates 
in place and the ambitious targets for the future (E20 
in 2025). Sugar cane is currently the main feedstock for 
ethanol production, although cassava also has potential. 
For both, there is competition over the crop’s use 
for food. The production of advanced ethanol – for 
which grasses and woody crops on degraded lands 
could be used – has significant potential, although cost 
competitiveness is an issue today. Currently more than 
90 projects for the production of advanced biofuels 
around the world are at various stages of development 
(IRENA, 2016g). Although none of these is based in 
Indonesia, and only one is based in Southeast Asia, 
these industry development play an important role to 
improve conversion technologies and reduce cost.
Industry
Beyond the use of liquid biofuels, bioenergy use in 
industry (mainly from solid biomass) will more than 
double in the Reference Case, while with the REmap 
Options it would nearly triple. The large contribution 
of bioenergy to supply process heat in Indonesia is 
encouraging, as industry remains a difficult sector in 
many countries in terms of increasing the penetration 
of renewable energy. The increased use of bioenergy 
in industrial processes in Indonesia comes with some 
barriers though. Agricultural residues form the largest 
feedstock for industrial bioenergy use in Indonesia. The 
seasonality of feedstock supply and the continuous 
energy demand of plants is a challenge, especially if 
storage space is unavailable. Another barrier is the 
relatively high transportation cost for feedstocks to 
maximise the use of bioenergy use across different 
locations. Palm oil residues have great potential for 
bioenergy but compete with other uses. Trunks and 
leaves generally are left on the ground to replenish 
the topsoil and act as a natural fertiliser. Limiting the 
potential for using wood waste for bioenergy, for which 
the REmap Options also have identified considerable 
potential, are regulations on wood recycling which are 
currently lacking (Sutapa, 2014).
Demand side
The challenges on the demand side for liquid biofuels 
relate mainly to the compensation required for blending, 
and to some extent to technical limitations. With low oil 
prices today, blenders in Indonesia require compensation 
given the higher production cost of liquid biofuels. A 
fund currently is in place to provide this compensation 
for biodiesel in transport, but not for its use in other 
sectors. A subsidy is currently unavailable for ethanol. 
There also are concerns that the funding for subsidised 
biodiesel will be inadequate if oil prices remain at 
low levels (Asmarini, 2016). For Indonesia to fulfil its 
blending mandates across sectors, these compensation 
issues would need to be addressed. Some concerns also 
exist over the technical challenges that come with the 
blending of liquid biofuels. PLN stated that using B30 
could cause damage to its power generators (Munthe 
and Asmarini, 2016). Although BPPT has confirmed 
that B20 is safe for use in automotive applications, 
the automotive industry voiced concerns over how 
engines might be affected (Cahyafitri and Yulisman, 
2015; Paryanto, 2015).
In industry the financial viability of projects and the 
lack of access to grids pose barriers to the accelerated 
use of bioenergy. For using palm oil residues, new mills 
have boilers that can use the biomass waste from the 
mill (such as empty fruit bunches and kernel shells), but 
old mills do not have this capability. Retrofitting comes 
with significant cost, which with today’s low oil prices 
puts pressure on its business case. For biogas from 
palm oil mill effluent, REmap has identified significant 
potential, and the recently signed PPA with PLN for a 
2.4 MW biogas plant from POME brings positive news 
(Sewatama, 2016). In many locations, however, the lack 
of access to grids remains an issue; IPP projects are the 
main way for POME-based biogas projects to be viable.
Finally, with the REmap Options an additional 8 million 
households – who would still rely on traditional uses of 
bioenergy for cooking in the Reference Case – will use 
modern cook stoves using solid biomass and ethanol. 
While these modern cook stoves (such as rocket stoves 
and ethanol cook stoves, which have been a popular 
option in parts of Africa) come with a significant upfront 
investment (around IDR 30 000) for low-income 
households, over time this is offset by reduced fuel cost 
and health benefits. The accelerated deployment of 
biogas digesters also will come with challenges. While the barriers and opportunities are largely similar to 
those for cook stoves that use solid biomass or ethanol, 
there is additional negative social stigma for the use 
of biogas, for example from public toilets. Although 
the Indonesia Domestic Biogas Programme is making 
progress, the number of installed biogas digesters in the 
country – at around 15 000 by the end of 2015 – is still 
modest compared to the potential. For all modern cook 
stoves using bioenergy, the subsidised price of LPG 
canisters for low-income households is an additional 
barrier.
Opportunities
● To ensure the sustainable use of bioenergy, the 
development of a comprehensive Indonesian 
bioenergy programme is recommended (see 
table 17). This should not only focus on the 
production of liquid biofuels but have a broader 
scope, as there are many interlinkages between 
sectors. Palm oil producers, for example, not only 
supply feedstock for biodiesel production, but 
also play an important role in increasing the use 
of residues and waste in the production of heat 
and electricity.
● The objectives of the programme should include 
a review of biofuel blending mandates for 
Indonesia, addressing current barriers on both the 
demand and supply side. One of the outcomes of 
such an assessment would be a more gradual 
roadmap for increasing blending mandates over 
time, with a more detailed assessment for each 
step as to how the increase is to be achieved in a 
sustainable manner.
● Similar long-term plans with intermediate targets 
(either a percentage mandate or a volumetric 
target of consumption) and monitoring towards 
these targets is required for the use of solid 
bioenergy and biogas in industry and the power 
sector. Policies should be evaluated and adapted 
as required on a regular basis towards meeting 
the targets.
● On the supply side, advanced biofuels should be 
a part of the solution. As mentioned, significant 
potential has been identified for perennial 
lignocellulosic feedstock which can be used 
for the production of advanced ethanol. This 
is an area where Indonesia could leverage its 
experience in biofuels while focusing R&D 
efforts on the local commercialisation of such 
technology.
● Other innovative supply-side approaches are also 
recommended. For example, there is the potential 
for ethanol production from the pulp produced 
as residues of cassava starch – instead of using 
the edible tuber parts – to avoid competition 
with the demand for cassava as food (Hermiati 
et al., 2012). The saps of the oil palm trunks that 
currently are left after trees are felled – and 
that emit a large volume of greenhouse gases 
in the form of methane – could be used to 
produce ethanol as well as other biomaterials, as 
they have a high glucose content (Kosugi et al., 
2010). A diffusion of such types of practical and 
climate-smart technologies and practices also 
will contribute to Indonesia’s zero-deforestation 
policies.
● For industry, adequate planning based on 
anticipated heating demand and customised 
storage solutions for bioenergy feedstock 
are recommended, especially for new 
industrial plants. In addition, a detailed plan 
is recommended to identify where the main 
feedstock sources are for the use of bioenergy 
in industry, taking into account also access to 
the power grid incorporating PLN’s transmission 
and distribution expansion plans up to 2025. 
Government rebates for retrofitting boilers to use 
biomass waste from mills could be considered.
● On the demand side, funding for liquid biofuel 
blending should be allocated in line with the 
targeted increase in blending mandates, increase 
of fuel usage, and oil price expectations. Concerns 
over technical limitations on using liquid biofuels 
should be taken into account and addressed early 
on. Programmes to reduce food waste would 
increase the potential for using local agricultural 
produce as bioenergy feedstock, and expanding 
the regulatory framework for wood recycling 
could support the additional use of wood waste 
for bioenergy.
● To expand the modern use of bioenergy for 
cooking, the efforts of the Indonesia Clean Stove Initiative – undertaken by the World Bank 
and MEMR – should be expedited. Phase III of 
this programme, which includes a scaled-up 
national programme for clean biomass cook 
stoves, was envisioned to begin in 2014 but has 
not started to date. Creating awareness of the 
viability of the solutions available in addition to 
expanding efforts in testing, setting standards 
and strengthening supply chains (especially in 
remote areas) will be crucial for the accelerated 
uptake of modern cook stoves. Local capacity 
building and options for local manufacturing are 
important for creating buy-in at the community 
level. The Indonesia Domestic Biogas Programme 
also would need to be scaled up further if the 
ambitions in the Reference Case (an estimated 
2 million biogas digesters to be in use by 2030) 
are to be achieved. Reducing subsidies on LPG 
canisters over time could support the accelerated 
uptake of modern cook stoves using bioenergy.
● Broad alignment among different stakeholders on 
the demand side, supply side and in government 
is required. On the demand side this includes 
relevant industries that can use bioenergy in 
their processes, key companies responsible 
for the blending and distribution of fuels, as 
well as automotive companies and PLN. On the 
supply side this includes biodiesel producers, 
large producers and sector representatives of 
bioenergy feedstock, as well as researchers 
and organisations involved in the assessment 
of the potential for using different feedstock. 
Government bodies that should be part of 
the discussions are, among others, MEMR, the 
Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Land and 
Spatial Planning, the Ministry of Environment 
and Forestry and the Ministry of Research, 
Technology, and Higher Education.
● Although it will be difficult to satisfy all 
stakeholders, ultimately the objective should be 
to maximise the benefits to society of the large 
bioenergy resources that Indonesia is endowed 
with. The indicators as developed by the Global 
Bioenergy Partnership and the recommendations 
from the pilot test in Indonesia should be 
incorporated to ensure the environmental, social 
and economic sustainability of bioenergy use in 
Indonesia.

feasibility and interconnection studies to ensure that 
projects meet predefined standards.
Off-grid areas have been identified as having great 
potential for solar PV to electrify remote villages. The 
lack of bankable off-takers, operational issues due to 
the insufficient O&M of systems, inadequate scaling of 
systems, and the risk to the viability of systems when 
the main grid arrives are key challenges in this area.
Ø Establish larger off-grid working areas that include 
multiple villages to achieve economies of scale and 
consider expanding PLN’s responsibility to build 
and own distribution networks in these areas. The 
creation of an entity to oversee O&M of systems, 
involving local communities, expanding the use of 
standardised survey methodologies to ensure that 
systems are scaled adequately, and strengthening 
regulatory frameworks on the integration of minigrids with the public grid are also recommended.
Project finance opportunities for renewable energy 
projects in Indonesia are limited at present, as local 
banks do not allocate large resources to this segment. 
The inflow of international climate funds is also limited, 
due mainly to the lack of project development equity to 
develop projects with proper site surveys, pre-feasibility 
studies and grid interconnection studies to reach a 
signed PPA.
Ø Increasing awareness at commercial banks of 
opportunities and clear signals from the government 
on long-term support for renewables could help 
banks to assign more resources to renewable energy 
project finance. Creating standard procedures and 
performance indicators for project developers 
will be important to ensure that projects can be 
financed. Loan guarantees can be considered by the 
government to further lower the risk to investors.
Land acquisition and community involvement issues 
revolve around a lack of clarity on land ownership in 
many locations, as well as costly and time-consuming 
REmap has identified significant potential for renewable 
energy in Indonesia across sectors and technologies. 
To accelerate the uptake of renewable energy, several 
challenges need to be addressed. Below is provided 
a summary of these challenges and related policy 
suggestions. In the power sector, barriers in key areas 
need to be addressed, along with some technologyspecific challenges.
Grid integration of VRE needs to be a focus area 
given the highly fragmented nature of Indonesia’s grid, 
with many small grids in remote locations. Detailed 
transmission and distribution expansion plans are 
provided on an annual basis by PLN, but locationspecific plans for VRE (solar, wind and marine) are 
not included. The projected deployment for each of 
the renewable energy technologies is also below the 
ambition set forth by the government.
Ø Align targets for renewable energy deployment 
and incorporate the expected deployment of VRE 
in transmission and distribution plans. Consider 
the potential of energy storage (including from 
electric vehicles) for the smoother integration of 
VRE and introduce priority dispatch for renewable 
energy generation by changing the structure of 
non-renewable energy IPPs.
Cost recovery for PLN remains an issue as feed-in tariffs 
for renewable energy generally exceed the price that 
PLN charges to consumers of electricity. PLN is also 
negotiating PPA agreements directly with renewable 
energy project developers, but requirements for parts of 
the approval process are not standardised. Furthermore, 
it is unclear if and when funding for these projects will 
be provided.
Ø Identify funds that that could cover the gap between 
renewable energy PPAs/feed-in tariffs and the 
revenues that PLN receives from consumers. The 
process for PLN to negotiate PPAs directly with 
developers for projects should be more standardised 
and should include detailed requirements for processes to acquire land, partly as a result of limited 
community buy-in for renewable energy projects.
Ø Local communities need to be involved early in the 
project development phase, and providing additional 
services to communities (such as additional 
electricity, clean water) could be considered. 
Large differences in the cost of land should be 
reflected more in the regional feed-in tariffs, and 
the government could consider taking an active role 
in providing lands for projects. Existing agricultural 
lands might have potential to integrate solar panels 
or wind turbines.
Technology-specific requirements (for solar PV, 
hydropower, geothermal power, bioenergy power, wind 
and marine energy) consist of, for example, increasing 
awareness of solutions, building local capacity and 
maximising local added value, streamlining permitting 
and regulatory frameworks, and expanding resource 
assessments.
Ø Beyond the power sector, REmap suggests large 
potential for increasing the share of renewable 
energy in the end-use sectors, with specific 
challenges for renewables in buildings, industry and 
transport.
Buildings have the highest share of renewable energy 
according to REmap. This consists mainly of bioenergy. 
Solar thermal for water heating and cooling has great 
potential as well, but limited awareness and a lack of 
design standards are holding back the market.
Ø Requirements for solar water heaters could be 
included in building codes, in line with the experience 
of many other countries. Demonstration projects 
for nascent solar cooling technologies should be 
considered.
Industry has a high renewable energy potential through 
the additional use of bioenergy and solar thermal for 
process heat. Limited awareness of the potential for solar 
collectors to supply heat for industrial processes and the 
intermittent supply of energy pose barriers, as well as 
space limitations that might be an issue for existing plants.
Ø The potential for solar thermal energy to substitute 
for petroleum products should be highlighted, for 
example through local demonstration projects. Solar 
thermal storage capacity and/or hybrid solutions in 
the design and construction of new industrial plants 
should be considered.
In transport the focus for renewable energy is on 
liquid biofuels, while electric vehicles remain largely 
unaddressed. A lack of infrastructure and regulatory 
frameworks is holding back the potential that REmap 
has identified for electric vehicles and electric two- and 
three-wheelers.
Ø Infrastructure investments, such as charging 
infrastructure at large parking lots in cities, 
should be combined with support policies (e.g., 
tax exemptions) to expand the market for electric 
vehicles and electric two- and three-wheelers. The 
local vehicle manufacturing base should be involved 
early on to kick-start the market and maximise 
localisation benefits.
Finally, challenges on both the supply and demand side 
related to bioenergy across sectors and applications 
need to be addressed. Ambitious mandates for liquid 
biofuel blending come with sustainability-of-supply 
concerns, and yield improvements and use of degraded 
lands alone might not be enough to meet the targets. 
For the use of residues and waste, challenges include 
the seasonality of supply, high transportation cost, 
financial viability and lack of grids to interconnect 
projects, and competition with other uses. The potential 
for the use of modern cook stoves using solid biomass 
and ethanol instead of traditional uses of bioenergy 
for cooking was also identified, but limited awareness 
and relatively high upfront investments required pose 
barriers for their uptake.
Ø A comprehensive bioenergy programme for Indonesia 
that includes relevant stakeholders on the supply and 
demand sides is recommended. The objective should 
be to maximise the sustainable use of Indonesia’s 
bioenergy resource through the development of 
gradually increasing targets across sectors. Innovative 
approaches and technologies on both the supply 
side and demand side should be included, while the 
environmental, social and economic sustainability of 
bioenergy use in Indonesia should be safeguarded. 
The efforts of the Indonesia Clean Stove Initiative and 
the Indonesia Domestic Biogas Programme should be 
expanded to advance the dissemination of modern 
cook stoves based on bioenergy.REFERENCES
