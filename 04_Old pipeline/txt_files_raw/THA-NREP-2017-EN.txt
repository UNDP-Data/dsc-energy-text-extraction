ENERGY OUTLOOK
THAILAND “Stability, Prosperity and Sustainability” is the vision that Thailand is pursuing in 2015-2020, 
as guided by Prime Minister Prayuth Chanocha. According to this five-year vision, the Ministry 
of Energy has focused on energy stability, prosperity and sustainability and has released the 
Thailand Integrated Energy Blueprint (TIEB), spanning 2015-2036. 
The blueprint combines five key energy plans from 2015, covering power, oil, gas, energy efficiency, 
and alternative energy development. The Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP 2015) set 
a target to increase renewables, whether in the form of electricity, heat or biofuels, to 30% of the 
country’s final energy consumption by 2036. This makes renewable energy one of Thailand’s top 
energy priorities. 
To achieve the AEDP 2015 target, the Ministry of Energy has put in place a number of support 
measures to promote renewable energy projects to the private sector and recognises the 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) as a solid partner in this dialogue. Thailand 
officially became a member of IRENA in 2015. The resulting collaboration between the Ministry 
of Energy and IRENA, with kind support from other Thai organisations, produced the Renewables 
Readiness Assessment (RRA) and REmap country analysis that form the basis of Renewable 
Energy Outlook: Thailand. This project is very successful contribution for Thailand on renewable 
energy forecast and analysis renewable energy policies. 
On behalf of Ministry of Energy of Thailand, I would like to express appreciation for IRENA’s 
efforts and support so far. I would also like to thank all the people and organisations involved in 
this project for their excellent co-operation and contributions. I look forward to continuing this 
great collaboration in the near future.

FOREWORD
from the
Minister of EnergyThailand, like other South-East Asian nations, stands at an important crossroads in its energy 
sector. It faces a rise in energy demand by almost 80% in the next two decades, driven by 
population growth and continued economic growth. This creates a challenging situation for a 
country that relies on energy imports for more than half of its energy supply. 
In response, Thailand has sought to enhance its energy security and meet long-term social and 
economic goals through improved efficiency and greater reliance on renewables. This quest has 
inspired others in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
Renewable Energy Outlook: Thailand, prepared by the International Renewable Energy Agency 
(IRENA) in close collaboration with the Department of Alternative Energy Development and 
Efficiency (DEDE) of the Thai Ministry of Energy, evaluates three sub-sectors – power generation, 
thermal use and bioenergy – and identifies key challenges. It also highlights the actions needed 
to meet or even exceed the country’s target of 30% renewables in the energy mix by 2036.
The study combines two key IRENA methodologies: the Renewables Readiness Assessment 
(RRA), based on country-led stakeholder consultations; and REmap, IRENA’s roadmap to double 
renewables in the energy mix. All ten ASEAN members took part in regional REmap analysis, 
which highlights a realistic path to reach 23% renewables regionally by 2025. As the present 
study indicates, Thailand could reach 37% renewables while reducing energy costs – saving some 
USD 8 billion per year with the environmental and health-related costs of fossil fuels taken into 
account.
I wish to acknowledge the strong support provided by the Ministry of Energy of Thailand for 
this study. The contribution of other stakeholders and international partners has also been 
invaluable to provide a broader perspective. IRENA will continue to support Thailand’s quest for 
a sustainable energy future in full partnership with the government authorities.

SUMMARYEnergy security has long been a top priority for Thailand. More than half of its 
energy supply relies on imported energy, a proportion that is likely to increase 
further when its proven reserves of oil and gas are depleted, as anticipated 
in less than a decade, unless other indigenous energy sources are exploited. 
This has not only challenged security of supply, but has also had significant 
implications for overall energy expenditure. Additionally, the commitments that 
the Government of Thailand has made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
20-25% from the business-as-usual scenario by 2030 requires concerted actions
for decarbonisation of the energy sector.
Thailand has set a new renewable energy target of 30% of total final energy 
consumption by 2036 in its Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) 2015. 
This study evaluates the three sub-sectors of power generation, thermal 
use and bioenergy, with a focus on the identification and analysis of the key 
challenges to achieving the targets set out in AEDP 2015. It conducts an in-depth 
renewable technology assessment using the International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA) REmap analysis tool to identify where additional potential for 
renewable energy lies while quantifying additional factors including cost, effects 
on externalities and investments. 
The key findings show that Thailand has the potential to increase the share of 
renewable energy in final energy from the present AEDP target of 30% in 2036 
to as high as 37%. The study also presents a different portfolio of technology 
options from those in AEDP 2015 with a minimum saving of USD 1.2 billion per year 
before factoring in the benefits from reduced adverse effects on health and 
the environment. However, to capture the benefits Thailand will need to invest 
significantly in its energy system over the coming two decades and consider the 
following findings and recommendations in addressing the challenges ahead. • In 2036, there is a large amount of hydropower
generating capacity, including 1 000 MW of
pumped storage, in all scenarios. This can be used 
as regulating power when needed, especially in
the scenario that the share of variable energy
sources, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) and
onshore wind power, in the power system
increase substantially.
• It is important to develop a portfolio that
includes a variety of different renewable energy
sources in the mix that can complement each
other in resource availability. This will help
achieve a higher overall capacity factor and
reduce the requirements for reserve capacity,
and thus minimise overall system costs.
• Other options are available, for instance,
matching variable renewable energy (VRE)
outputs with load as much as possible using
intelligent control systems, including adopting
demand-side management schemes. From a
long-term perspective, there might be a need
to establish an auxiliary market to enable
independent regulating power providers to take
a more active role in different market segments,
so as to ensure grid stability and reliability.
Therefore, it is advisable that Thailand conducts
a feasibility study of establishing a market
for better utilisation of existing and potential
reserve margins.
• Most of the industrial facilities that can
potentially use biomass for process heat are
large-scale, centralised plants operating at
economies of scale, which would require large
energy flows to be brought from within and
across national borders. Cost-competitiveness
of biomass can be maintained through an
effective logistics infrastructure as consumption
increases. Therefore, it is essential to support
the development of biomass supply chains that
ensure the delivery of reliable, high-quality and
affordable biomass fuels to those industries that
are willing to use them. The development of
such supply chains would benefit not only heat
applications, but also electricity production and,
more importantly, co-generation of heat and
power. The development of such supply chains
biomass feedstocks. Yet, it should be made clear 
that food security for both humans and livestock 
must remain the top priority. For this reason, 
the focus of further development in the AEDP 
should be on biomass supply chains that do not 
threaten food security.
• Consequently, to sustain the supply chain, there
must be clear policy and legal frameworks
on land tenure and use, which are the basic
elements that enable long-term commitment
and investment in agriculture, especially at
the levels that are required to sustain a strong
bioenergy sector that does not compete with
food production. Second is the need to establish
a fair and reasonable market environment with
a clear pricing mechanism for biomass that can
offer long-term purchase guarantees, based on
projected demand, and to smooth out as much
as possible the seasonal variation in feedstock
yields. To some extent, this market environment
should also factor out the commodity price
volatility of the international markets. This
would help minimise the negative impact of
oil price volatility on farmers’ finances, and in
return enhance their confidence in investments
in energy crops.
Additionally, prices should in principle be stable 
or predictable over the long term, and should 
not be set too high or too low in relation to 
food prices. Third, a fair and sound regulatory 
framework should be put in place to ensure a 
fair distribution of the benefits between farmers 
and energy producers, particularly when trade 
is through processing collection companies 
(including agricultural cooperatives that are 
operating as a collector in some places), 
processing mills, and other involved businesses. 
Lastly, the use of new technologies for managing 
the feedstocks and derived products should be 
encouraged, for instance solid biomass pellets, 
provided they can meet the expected or desired 
quality assurance.
• Energy demand in Thailand is expected to
increase by 78% by 2036, and gross domestic
product (GDP) by 126%. Renewables will play
an important role in meeting this demand. Inadditional potential are solar PV, increasing from 
6 gigawatts (GW) to almost 17 GW, and onshore 
wind, doubling from 3 GW to 6 GW. Therefore, 
greater attention should be paid to solar PV 
and wind power given the huge potential they 
present in the analysis.
• Bioenergy remains the dominant renewable
source in Thailand’s end-use sectors due to its
ability to be used for heat and transport fuels. The
analysis shows that Thailand has huge potential
to replace traditional bioenergy with modern
cookstoves and biogas digesters, resulting in an
increase in modern bioenergy in the residential
sector and reversal of the uptake in liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) foreseen in AEDP 2015.
• Renewable thermal energy utilisation accounts
for nearly two-thirds of the total increment of
renewables in final energy by 2036, if the AEDP
2015 target is met as projected in the plan.
The majority of this is expected to come from
biomass according to the plan. Solar thermal
represents “low-hanging fruit” in the end-use
sectors, and can be scaled up significantly in
buildings for water heating and in industry for
low-temperature heating and pre-heating.
Thailand should set the right policy framework 
for the effective use of renewable thermal energy, 
with a suite of dedicated incentive schemes as it 
did for promoting the use of renewable energy 
sources in the power and transport sectors. To 
achieve this, a statistical system is required that 
can collect and assemble the right set of energy 
metrics for renewable thermal energy. To this 
end, it is recommended that a comprehensive 
study is conducted to review the current data 
system, including the scope of technologies 
covered and the ways in which the data are 
collected, assembled, reported and analysed for 
renewable thermal energy. 
On the demand side, there is a need for 
studies to look further into the feasibility 
of the potential applications, followed by a 
promotional strategy.
• Thailand has developed a strong automobile
industry. In the transport sector REmap focuses
on identifying the potential of electric vehicles
(EVs) and as a result the demand for electricity
in the sector triples. The number of passenger
EVs on the road in Thailand by 2036 would total
1.5 million and electric two- and three-wheelers
would total over 3.5 million. To achieve this,
Thailand should develop a better, proactive
system of planning for technological and
infrastructure development. EVs could have an
important role as an alternative to petroleumderived transport fuels in Thailand, but the
country should avoid a swift change in policy
direction.
Thailand is advised to devise a long-term 
strategic development plan or roadmap for 
the transport sector, including vehicles, fuel 
types and the necessary infrastructure. For 
instance, Thailand could tap into electric twoand three-wheeler markets, including tuk-tuks, 
and establish local manufacturing capacities to 
deliver quality products at acceptable prices for 
Thai consumers. There is no competition with 
conventional car manufacturers in this market 
segment. For four wheelers, Thailand could start 
with the market for fixed-route transport that has 
a predictable range of distance, such as public 
buses, light freight vehicles for delivery services, 
and sightseeing or tour buses. Alongside the 
development of manufacturing capacity for EVs, 
Thailand should increase investment in charging 
facilities for EVs, including on-street charging 
for urban EVs and two-/three-wheelers as well 
as fast-charging stations, in order for the market 
to develop in an organic way. INTRODUCTION1.1 Country background
The Kingdom of Thailand, located in Southeast Asia, is home to 68 million people in 
an area of 513,000 square kilometres divided into 76 provinces (excluding Bangkok, 
which is defined as a Special Administration Zone) with six regions, namely the 
Northern region (9 provinces), Southern region (14 provinces), Eastern region 
(7 provinces), Western region (5 provinces), Northeastern region (20 provinces) 
and Central region (21 provinces) (UNSD, 2016). The country is adjacent to the 
Lao People’s Democratic Republic (hereinafter referred to as Lao PDR) in the 
east, Myanmar in the north and Malaysia and Cambodia in the south, making it an 
important corridor for the long-distance transmission of electric power.
Over the past three decades, Thailand has made remarkable progress on many 
fronts, including strong economic growth1
 that helped lift millions out of poverty 
and the country up to an upper-middle income economy.2 During this time, the 
industrial and commercial sectors have rapidly evolved into major contributors of 
growth to gross domestic product (GDP), while the importance of agriculture has 
reduced in this regard (World Bank, 2016).
However, 11% of the population remained in poverty by 2014, according to the 
World Bank, the majority of whom reside in rural areas. The rural population 
accounts for largely half of the total population. As illustrated in Figure 1, since 
2001 urbanisation has substantially increased the migration of the rural labour 
force into cities, driven in part by increased productivity in the agricultural sector 
and growing demand for labour in the industrial sector. As with other developing 
economies, this trend is likely to continue, should Thailand continue its efforts 
in industrial development. The World Bank projected that the rural population 
would decline to one-third of the total population by 2036 (World Bank, 2017).
01The industrial sector, including energy-intensive 
sub-sectors such as iron and steel, mining, 
petrochemicals and construction, provides jobs 
for about 20% of the labour force, constituting 
about 40% of GDP. However, given that the 
manufacturing sub-sector, including automobiles, 
electronics and food processing, is to a large extent 
export-oriented, Thailand’s economy may become 
more vulnerable to global and regional economic 
situations unless its portfolios of trading partner 
countries and commodities can be adequately 
diversified.

1.2 Regional context
Thailand together with Indonesia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines and Singapore founded the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967, which 
was subsequently joined by the other five countries 
in Southeast Asia (ACE, 2017a). ASEAN economic 
performance has been significant over the past five 
decades since its founding, with the exception of 
the financial crises. ASEAN has become the sixthlargest economy in the world with a doubling 
of its share of global GDP over the same period 
(ASEANstats, 2017). The momentum of its growth 
is projected to continue at an annual rate of 5.1% 
of real GDP for the immediate term, i.e. over 
2017-21, according to estimates by the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD, 2017),3
 and at around 4.6% for the longer 
term to 2035-40 according to estimates in the 
Southeast Asia Energy Outlook (IEA, 2013) and the 
5th ASEAN Energy Outlook (ACE, 2017b). This would 
lead to a substantial growth in energy demand over 
the next two decades or more, even though average 
regional energy elasticity is expected to decline 
thanks to improved energy efficiency and energy 
conservation. By 2040, the total energy demand of 
ASEAN member states is expected to increase by 
110-130% compared to the levels of 2014 or 2015,4 as 
estimated by the Institute of Energy Economics of 
Japan (IEEJ) in 2016 (IEEJ, 2016) and by the ACE in 
2017 in its 5th ASEAN Energy Outlook, respectively.
Today more than three-quarters of regional energy 
production is from three primary resources in 
ASEAN, namely coal, oil and natural gas, which 
are unevenly distributed in just a few countries. 
Indonesia possesses 80% of the steam coal reserve 
while Viet Nam has most of the rest (18%). About 
87% of the total natural gas reserves and 90% of the 
crude oil are in Indonesia, Viet Nam and Malaysia. 
For lignite, 92% of the total reserves in the region 
are in Indonesia and Thailand (ACE, 2015a). ASEAN renewable energy resources also hold great 
potential,5
 dominated by hydro resources in the 
Greater Mekong Sub-region, but also with abundant 
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass energy across 
the region (IRENA and ACE, 2016). With drastic cost 
reductions in certain renewable energy technologies 
and the multiple benefits associated with modern 
renewable energy applications, renewable energy 
has been given a lot of attention in most ASEAN 
member states. The benefits it offers include 
enhanced energy security, improved environmental 
quality (particularly reduced air pollution) and 
the creation of new job opportunities, as well as 
provision of cost-effective electrification options to 
the remote areas or islands.
In this context, ASEAN has set a region-wide 
renewable energy target in the ASEAN Plan of 
Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) 2016-25, 
aimed at achieving 23% renewables in total primary 
energy consumption by 2025 (ACE, 2015b), and 
ASEAN Energy Ministers have made a commitment 
to support the scaling up of renewable energy 
sources at the regional level (ASEAN, 2016).
1.3 Methodologies
This Renewable Energy Outlook for Thailand was 
conducted jointly by the International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA) team and the Department 
of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency 
(DEDE) of the Ministry of Energy (MoE) of Thailand, 
applying two methodologies that were developed 
by IRENA, namely the Renewable Readiness 
Assessment (RRA) and REmap analysis. 
Renewable Readiness Assessment
IRENA developed the RRA as a tool for carrying out 
a comprehensive evaluation of the conditions for 
renewable energy deployment in a particular country. 
The RRA is a country-led and consultative process. It 
provides a venue for multi-stakeholder dialogue to 
identify challenges to renewable energy deployment 
and to come up with solutions to existing barriers. For 
Thailand, the RRA methodology was applied to assess 
the key challenges the country faces in achieving its 
2036 target of 30% of total final energy consumption 
(TFEC) to be provided by renewable resources 
by 2036, as established in its Alternative Energy 
Development Plan (AEDP) 2015 (DEDE, 2015). 
IRENA and DEDE worked alongside a local consultant 
to conduct research, set the process in motion and 
co-ordinate with relevant stakeholders. The first 
step in the RRA process was to prepare the basic 
background information, which presents an overview 
of the geographical, economic and social environment 
of Thailand. It describes the present status of the 
energy sector, available renewable energy resources, 
and the energy policies, programmes and strategies 
adopted thus far to advance renewables use. 
IRENA, supported by DEDE and the local consultant, 
interviewed key stakeholders (government 
agencies, grid operators, industrial associations, 
project developers, financial institutions and 
academia) to validate these issues and to gather 
first-hand information and data on what is already 
happening on the ground. The interview results 
fed into the analysis of AEDP 2015 with the aim of 
assessing how feasible it would be to achieve its 
targets. The qualitative analysis provides a baseline 
or reference case for the quantitative analysis that 
was conducted by applying REmap methodology 
to chart out the alternative pathways of achieving 
a high share of renewables by 2036. 
REmap – Renewable Energy 
Roadmap analysis
The REmap programme6
 – IRENA’s Renewable 
Energy Roadmaps – paves the way to promoting 
accelerated renewable energy development 
through a series of activities, including global, 
regional and country studies. The global REmap 
programme includes analysis of 70 countries 
accounting for 90% of world energy use, while a 
REmap regional analysis for ASEAN identified the 
path for the region to achieve its renewable energy 
target of 23% in the energy mix by 2025.7
5
 Renewable energy sources in the report cover all forms of renewables, including large-scale hydropower generation facilities, while in Thailand, alternative energy
includes renewables and some forms of non-renewable-derived alternative, albeit renewables are the predominant component. 
6 REmap analysis and activity also informs IRENA publications on specific renewable technologies or energy sectors and topics
More related reports can be found REmap takes a bottom-up approach. The analysis 
utilises an internally developed REmap tool that 
incorporates detailed energy demand and supply 
data by sector, a substitution analysis on technology 
options for renewables, and an assessment of 
associated costs, investments and benefits. The 
analytical process is carried out by IRENA teams 
in close collaboration with the energy experts in 
countries through a series of multi-stakeholder 
consultative workshops and expert meetings. 
For the case of Thailand, the analysis presented 
in this report builds on the initial REmap analysis 
conducted for the country as part of the regional 
report for ASEAN. The IRENA team has expanded 
and deepened the scope of the analysis. The 
baseline and projection years were also adjusted to 
the Thailand context, i.e. 2015 and 2036 in relation 
to Thailand’s AEDP 2015. IRENA has engaged 
Thailand through DEDE over the course of 2016 and 
2017 through two multi-stakeholder consultative 
workshops, several expert group meetings, indepth interviews and field studies to deepen an 
understanding of the potential of renewables in the 
country.

approach for the REmap analysis, please see Annex: 
REmap Methodology, Assessment Approach and 
Data Sources. ENERGY
CONTEXT Thailand has explicitly set energy security as the top policy objective, followed 
by economic affordability and environmental sustainability, in the Thailand 
Integrated Energy Blueprint (TIEB) underpinned by five individual but interrelated 
energy plans covering natural gas, oil, energy efficiency, the power sector and 
alternative energy sources, respectively. Such prioritisation was in response to 
the continuous growth in energy demand while depleting domestic reserves of 
energy resources in Thailand. 
However, with the Paris Agreement entering into force in November 2016, options 
to enhance energy security require re-evaluation from a climate perspective 
in order for the Government of Thailand to fulfil its commitment, known as 
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), to reduce carbon emissions from its 
energy, industrial,8 agricultural and waste sectors by 20-25% from the businessas-usual scenario by 2030. 
This chapter first provides an overview of Thailand’s energy system and a brief 
evolution of the energy balance over the past decade, with a special focus 
on expenditure on energy importation, and a snapshot of emissions from the 
energy sector. This is followed by the key legislation shaping the current energy 
sector, and a map-out of the main institutions in the energy sector with their 
core mandates. The key energy policies and plans, especially the TIEB, are also 
discussed in this chapter. 
This chapter is intended to present the key elements used to contextualise 
the discussions and analysis in the other chapters, rather than to provide a 
comprehensive description of Thailand’s energy sector status and evolution, 
which would deserve a separate study of their own. 
022.1 Overall energy system
Energy consumption and production
For the past decade, Thailand’s total TFEC has been 
steadily increasing, as illustrated in Figure 2. The 
industrial and transport sectors consumed largely 
three-quarters of the total. The secondary axis in 
the figure shows the energy dependence ratio,9 
with more than one-half of TFEC met by imported 
energy sources. 
Expenditure on energy imports reached a peak of 
12% of Thailand’s GDP in 2008, attributable to the oil 
price surge. While it had nearly halved from the peak 
in 2015, the country’s energy dependence ratio,on 
the other hand, went up in response to the lower oil 
prices (EPPO, 2016a). This might not be regarded 
as an alarming signal if it were put into historical 
perspective. Over the past four decades, Thailand 
has been relying on imported fuels to meet more 
than half of its energy demand, having reached a 
record high of 90% dependence in the 1970s before 
the discovery and extraction of indigenous oil and 
natural gas resources. 
However, the combination of high dependence 
ratios and today’s intensified energy-commodity 
price volatility could pose a greater energy security 
challenge in the future, unless substantial efforts are 
made to improve energy efficiency and diversify the 
energy mix while maximising the use of domestic 
energy resources, especially renewables given the 
limited oil and natural gas reserves.
Thailand has its own fossil energy resources such 
as crude oil, natural gas and coal, but the oil and 
gas are not adequate for domestic consumption 
and are expected to deplete in a decade if current 
production rates were to remain same as they are.10
If only the proven reserves are counted, Thailand 
would have about 4-5 years left for either oil

or natural gas, according to data from the MoE, 
while merely 2.3 years for oil and 5.5 years for gas 
according to BP. Put it into perspective, the world 
average for oil or natural gas is about 50 years or so 
(EPPO, 2016a; BP, 2016). Electric power system 
Thailand has a well-established electric power grid 
infrastructure providing nearly universal access to 
electricity, thanks to the two-decade long Thailand 
Accelerated Rural Electrification programme. Power 
production has been steadily increasing to meet 
growing demand, as illustrated in Figure 5. This 
was, in part, attributable to the abundant supply 
of domestic natural gas following its exploration 
and discovery in the 1970s. With the depletion of 
natural gas reserves, Thailand has stepped up its 
effort in diversifying the power mix by increasing 
the share of renewable energy sources, in particular 
solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power generation 
capacity, as discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. 
Figure 3 shows that natural gas, condensate 
and crude oil accounted for 61% of total energy 
production from indigenous energy resources in 
2015. On the consumption side, oil-derived energy 
products and natural gas accounted for around 70%11
of Thailand’s TFEC, as presented in Figure 4. This 
means that imported energy or domestic lignite 
coal consumption would increase if the other forms 
of energy were scaled up to fill the gap from the 
depletion of indigenous oil and gas resources. If 
so, this might lock Thailand into a carbon-intensive 
energy system in future, unless carbon capture and 
storage can present a viable technological option, 
which does not appear as if it will be the case.

Based on data from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) and Metropolitan 
Electricity Authority (MEA), compiled by Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO)
Thailand’s electrical infrastructure consists of three 
systems, which are a) the generating system, 
including EGAT, independent power producers 
(IPPs), small power producers (SPPs)12 and very 
small power producers (VSPPs),13 b) the transmission 
system (EGAT), and c) the distribution system 
(PEA and MEA). In addition, the annual power exchange 
with and purchase from neighbouring countries 
through interconnected grids contribute about 7% of 
the total electricity consumption (IEA, 2016). 
As of September 2016, the electricity generating 
capacity of Thailand’s system reached nearly 
42 gigawatts (GW),14 of which, by technology, 
combined-cycle and condensation thermal power 
plants counted for about 70% of the total, while 
renewables accounted for 17%, as illustrated in 
Figure 6. As regards the ownership of generation 
assets, EGAT owns and controls the largest share of 
the nation’s total, while the other half is owned by 
IPPs, SPPs and VSPPs. 
12 Generation capacity of 10-90 megawatts (MW).
13 Generation capacity no greater than 10 MW.
14 Including the installed generation capacity of Thailand and those that are 
 accessible through power purchase contracts with neighbouring countries. 
As to the electricity generated, Figure 7 below 
shows that natural gas and hard coal and lignite 
accounted for nearly 90%, while renewable 
electricity contributed only 10% of the total. It is 
evident that fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, 
followed by hard coal and lignite, still remain the 
dominant fuel for power generation, while biomassbased energy sources account for the major share

Based on data from EGAT
Aside from domestic generation, Thailand signed 
a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the 
purchase of electricity from Lao PDR in September 
2016. The agreement allows for the purchase of 
up to 9 000 MW, including 1 878 MW from lignite 
and the rest from hydropower. Hydropower from 
the Lao PDR is insignificantly affected by seasonal 
variations in hydrological circulation due mainly 
to the large capacity of its reservoirs and high 
surface water run-off. In addition, Thailand has 
also been increasing its electricity imports from 
other countries, such as Myanmar and Malaysia. 
Electricity imports from neighbouring countries 
would be expected to increase over the next two 
decades, but will be capped at 15% due to security 
concerns. 
With regard to power transmission and distribution, 
EGAT owns and manages the transmission system, 
thus acting as the transmission grid operator, while 
PEA and MEA are responsible for the operation 
of distribution networks, taking the role of 
distribution grid operator, although they also own 
certain transmission lines with a voltage level of 
69 kilovolts (kV) and 115 kV. 
For the transmission networks managed by 
EGAT, the standard voltage levels are 500 kV, 
300 kV, 230 kV, 132 kV, 115 kV and 69 kV at the 
operating frequency of 50 hertz. The total length 
of transmission lines as of March 2017 was 33 430 
circuit-kilometres connected by more than 200 
substations with the total transformer capacity of 
100 829 mega-volt amperes (MVA). 
For the distribution networks within MEA, the 
standard voltage levels are 230 kV, 115 kV and 69 kV 
transmission lines. The total length of transmission 
lines as of December 2015 was 1 742 circuitkilometres. The distribution system also contains 
24 kV and 12 kV feeders of 18 434 circuit-kilometres, 
and 220/380 volt secondary lines of 28 307 circuitkilometres. There were 132 substations with the 
transformers totalling 17 905 MVA of installed 
capacity (MEA, 2015).
PEA, responsible for electricity supply covering 
99.4% of the country’s area, has standard voltage 
levels of 115 kV, 69 kV, 22-33 kV and less than 
22-33 kV distribution lines. It owned 11 776 circuitkilometres of the total transmission line in 2015 
(PEA, 2015).
In addition to its role as grid operator, EGAT also 
operates its own electricity generation facilities, 
and purchases electricity from domestic IPPs, SPPs and neighbouring countries, while only VSPPs can 
sell electricity directly to PEA and MEA. In VSPPs’ 
case, MEA has already connected 54 projects with 
a purchasing capacity of 67 MW while PEA has 
connected 839 projects with 3,498 MW (ERC, 2016). 
For electricity consumption by economic sector, 
the industrial sector (76 914 GWh or 42.4%), the 
commercial sector (61 446 GWh or 33.9%) and the 
residential sector (41 443 GWh or 22.8%) are the 
key consumers, as shown in Figure 8.

2.2 Key energy legislation and 
institutions
Key energy legislation
In 1992, three important pieces of energy legislation 
were enacted, namely, the National Energy Policy 
Council Act, B.E. 2535 (1992), amended by the National 
Energy Policy Council Act (No. 2), B.E. 2550 (2007) 
and the National Energy Policy Council Act (No. 3), 
B.E. 2551 (2008), the Energy Development and 
Promotion Act, B.E. 2535 (1992), and the Energy 
Conservation Promotion Act, B.E. 2535 (1992), 
amended by the Energy Conservation Promotion Act 
(No. 2), B.E. 2550 (2007). These acts, as amended and 
alongside the Energy Industry Act, B.E. 2550 (2007), 
have largely defined today’s legislative framework 
for Thailand’s energy sector, providing the legal 
foundation for national energy sector management, 
development of energy production, transport and 
distribution, and also energy efficiency improvements. 
The key elements of the above-mentioned 
legislation are described in Table 1. Table 1. Key elements of important energy legislation

Thailand Law Forum (2016), National Energy Policy Council Act, B.E.2535 (1992), 
www.thailawforum.com/database1/national-energy-act.html; 
and the Energy Development and Promotion Act, B.E. 2535 (1992), As presented in Table 1, the acts provide the 
legal foundation for establishing the main energy 
institutions administering the energy sector in 
Thailand, including the National Energy Policy 
Council, the MoE, the Energy Regulatory Commission, 
EPPO, and DEDE (the former Department of Energy 
Development and Promotion). In addition, they also 
provide the legislative basis for energy policies, 
regulations and development plans. 
Main institutions in the energy sector
The National Energy Policy Council (NEPC), chaired 
by the Prime Minister with the support of the Deputy 
Prime Minister designated by the Prime Minister as 
Vice-Chairman, is the ultimate authoritative body 
for the review and approval of proposals pertaining 
to national energy policy and regulation, energy 
sector management and development plans and 
strategies, with the objective of enhancing energy 
security and reducing dependency on imported 
energy while ensuring the affordability and 
sustainability of energy commodities. 
In addition to the Chairs, the council also has among 
its membership: 11 cabinet ministers who are highly 
relevant to energy sector policy and management;15
one minister attached to the Office of the Prime 
Minister; the Secretary-General of the Council of 
State, indicating strong engagement from the top 
management of the administration;16 the SecretaryGeneral of the National Economic and Social 
Development Board; the Director of the Bureau of 
the Budget due to the close ties between energy and 
the country’s economic and budgetary activities; the 
Permanent Secretary of Energy; and the DirectorGeneral of the Energy Policy and Planning Office. 
Each member has one vote in the decision-making 
process and a decision is made by a majority of votes. 
Benefiting from the high-level involvement of 
important cabinet ministries, the NEPC serves de 
facto as an inter-ministerial co-ordination mechanism 
for policy making as well as implementation. In 
the face of rising interaction of energy with other 
sectors on a range of issues – energy security, 
climate challenges, regional and local environments, 
rural development, job creation and the adoption 
of information and communication technologies 
has become increasingly important for making 
important decisions on energy policy. These 
include determining the price of energy products 
and ensuring effective policy implementation, such 
as the TIEB, which contains five individual but 
interrelated plans. 
At the operational level, EPPO as part of the MoE 
provides technical support to the NEPC, in addition to 
any other committees or sub-committees that may be 
established if requested in addition to the NEPC.
The Ministry of Energy (MoE) is the governmental 
authority responsible for oversight of the overall 
operation of the energy sector, including fossil 
fuels, electric power and rural energy supply, and 
also including managing the Thailand Oil Fund. 
It was also given a mandate to propose energy 
policies and regulations, formulate energy plans 
and strategies and supervise their implementation. 
The MoE is supported by its four operational 
departments covering energy policy and planning, 
managing mineral fuels, supervising energy 
business operations, and promoting alternative and 
energy efficiency, respectively. 
The Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO) 
acts as an operational body of the NEPC and is 
responsible for formulating proposals on national 
energy policy and strategies addressing the existing 
and emerging challenges in energy management, 
energy conservation, promotion of alternative 
energy sources and oil supply. It oversees the 
implementation of various policies and plans upon 
entry into force. 
It was behind the consolidation of the five individual 
energy plans into one master plan with the same 
timeframe, i.e. the TIEB 2015-36. The harmonisation 
was indeed a positive move towards the common 
goals that Thailand has been striving to achieve.17 
Yet, how to implement the plan in an orchestrated 
manner remains a challenge. 
15 The Minister of Defence, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, the Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives, the Minister of 
Transport, the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, the Minister 
of Energy, the Minister of Commerce, the Minister of Interior, the Minister of 
Science and Technology, the Minister of Industry.
16 A hi
hll dibdfthPiMiitll dThe Department of Alternative Energy 
Development and Efficiency (DEDE) has an 
increasingly significant role to play in the context 
of the growing concerns over security of energy 
supply and the climate targets set in the Paris 
Agreement, and the falling costs of some renewable 
energy technologies over the past five years, such 
as solar PV modules and inverters, and on-shore 
wind power systems. In addition to renewables, 
DEDE also promotes energy efficiency measures as 
an instrument to reduce or minimise the growth in 
energy demand. The Permanent Energy Secretary 
oversees the operation of this department, while 
the Director-General is the commanding officer for, 
and thus responsible for the performance of, the 
department. 
It is worth pointing out that DEDE covers the domain 
of all alternatives to conventional energy sources in 
view of seeking optimal or plausible solutions for the 
long-term energy security for Thailand. Therefore 
it covers more than just renewables in the notion 
defined as “alternative”. Having that said, while the 
meaning of “renewable energy” is clearly defined in 
both the National Energy Policy Council Act (1992)18
and the Energy Development and Promotion Act 
(1992), there is no such definition for “alternative” 
energy in any of the legislation. 
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand 
(EGAT) is a state-owned enterprise managed by the 
Ministry of Energy that is responsible for electricity 
generation, including those from IPPs and SPPs, 
as well as the transmission network and bulk 
electricity sales in Thailand. Being the largest power 
producer in Thailand with its own operating power 
plants at 45 sites across the country, EGAT could 
generate electricity at the total installed capacity 
of 16 GW by June 2017, or 42% of Thailand’s total 
generation capacity. With regard to electricity 
system implementation, the Energy Regulatory 
Commission regulates power purchases and sets 
policy on power sector procurement.
EGAT, as the sole owner of the transmission system, 
manages 500 kV, 230kV and 115 kV lines, including 
the 300 kV high-voltage direct current (HVDC) link 
in the south with Malaysia.
The Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) 
engages in the distribution of electricity in Thailand. 
Being a state-owned enterprise under Ministry of 
Interior, MEA is responsible for the high-voltage 
distribution network within its service territory of 
Bangkok, Nonthaburi and Samut Prakarn Provinces, 
supplying two-thirds of Thailand’s electricity 
demand to its customers. MEA is also involved in 
the design, installation and maintenance of highvoltage and low-voltage electrical systems. MEA 
owns no power plants, purchasing electricity from 
EGAT or directly from VSPPs. 
MEA also works in other sectors, including, for 
example, centralised air-conditioning systems, the 
manufacture and distribution of electrical products 
and operating fibre-optic telecommunication 
network and data centres.
The Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) is a stateowned enterprise under the Ministry of Interior and 
is responsible for providing 74 provinces with the 
generation, procurement, distribution and sale of 
electricity. The 510 000 kilometre square area, or 
99.4% of the country, excludes Bangkok, Nonthaburi 
and Samut Prakarn Provinces, which are managed 
by EGAT. PEA does not own or control any voltage 
lines greater than 115 kV within its service territory.
The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), 
established on the foundation of the Energy 
Industry Act (2007), was designed to function as an 
independent regulatory agency overseeing energy 
sector operations in both the power and natural gas 
sectors. One of its main tasks is to make sure tariffs 
are calculated in an appropriate and transparent 
manner and the procurement process is followed, 
ensure fair competition in the energy marketplaces 
and thus ultimately protect the interests of energy 
consumers. Through its 13 regional offices covering 
the entire country, ERC works directly with energy 
consumers, licensees and various stakeholders. 
ERC’s budget and work plan are reviewed by the 
MoE, which also nominates the chairmanship 
of ERC. This interaction could in some way risk 
jeopardising ERC’s independence. 
18 “Renewable energy” defined in the act includes “energy obtained from
 wood, firewood, paddy husk, bagasse, biomass, hydropower, solar power, The Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT), as the 
largest energy company in Thailand, is responsible 
for the supply of petroleum and natural gas. PTT 
seeks to secure the long-term supply of natural 
gas on the global markets. Pipelines and liquefied 
natural gas terminals are part of PTT’s infrastructural 
development in this regard. 
2.3 Energy policy and plan
With greater volatility of energy commodity prices, 
the rising concern over energy security and the 
increasingly compelling cases made for renewables, 
the dynamics shaping the energy policy landscape 
have rapidly evolved in Thailand. The primary 
objectives of national energy policies are centred 
on enhancing the country’s energy security by 
diversifying the energy mix and strengthening 
the supply of depleting fossil fuels, while keeping 
energy prices at affordable rates and minimising 
the adverse impacts of energy production and 
consumption on the environment and society. 
Overall, Thailand’s policy objectives for energy 
sector development have remained consistent, with 
a central focus on enhancing the security of energy 
supply in recognition of its critical importance to 
national economic and social development. 
National Energy Policy 2008
National Energy Policy 2008 was released in the 
context of the world being in the middle of oil 
price volatility. It therefore placed even greater 
stress on the importance of energy security and 
put forth a series of targets and actions to reduce 
the country’s dependence on imported fuels by 
increasing the domestic supply of energy sources, 
and secure long-term supply from international 
energy commodity markets, as well as improve 
energy efficiency. The energy policy, along with 
the Renewable Energy Development Plan (REDP) 
(2008-22),19 aimed to increase energy security and 
the use of alternative energy sources, encourage 
high-efficiency energy technologies, and scale up 
green alternatives among communities. 
Thailand Integrated Energy Blueprint
In 2015, the five major energy plans were 
harmonised into one integrated energy document 
known as the Thailand Integrated Energy Blueprint 
(TIEB) 2015-36. At present, the TIEB serves de facto 
as the national energy policy and energy sector 
development plan combined. This is because the 
official National Energy Policy 2008 has yet to be 
updated or replaced by a new policy document 
that may be developed in future.20 The long-term 
perspective and system approach taken in the 
TIEB could potentially change the way that energy 
policy is implemented in Thailand. It could yield 
the desired results, provided that an effective 
mechanism for inter-ministerial co-ordination and 
an implementation monitoring system are put in 
place. 
The TIEB consists of the Power Development 
Plan (PDP), the Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP), the 
Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP), the 
Oil Plan, and the Gas Plan. The assumption on the 
annual average GDP growth rate over 2015-36 was 
3.94%, as estimated in the National Economic and 
Social Development Plan, being slightly adjusted 
downward from the previously estimated 4.41% in 
the 2010-30 Power Development Plan. 
Table 2 below highlights the key targets set under 
each plan, with a breakdown for the power sector, 
heating, and transport. 
19 It was updated twice before the present version, which is known as AEDP
 2015 (2015-36).
20 According to the interview with EPPO, a new version of the National
Energy Policy will be established in the short term – two to three years as 
a roughly estimated timeframe.Table 2. Key targets in energy plans, 2015-2036

ENERGYThis chapter describes Thailand’s key achievements on renewable energy 
development over the past decades, with the success factors and the important 
lessons learnt, and the status of development of the renewable energy sector with 
a breakdown into the power sector, renewable energy for heating, and biofuels. 
3.1 Overview of renewable energy 
development in Thailand
Thailand has long been promoting and supporting energy development, especially in 
the field of alternative energy21 and energy conservation, driven primarily by the pursuit 
of enhanced energy security, stabilised economic prosperity and improved well-being. 
With the steadily increased use of alternative energy sources and improved energy 
efficiency, imports of fossil fuels would be expected to decline, and so would the longterm risks of energy expenditure on energy importation. In addition, indigenous clean 
energy development could bring multiple co-benefits such as environmental, social and 
economic advantages, including job creation, in comparison to imported fossil fuels. 
Toward this end, indigenous renewable energy resources, including solar, wind, 
various biomass-based energy sources and hydropower, have been given priority 
with clear and ambitious targets and supportive policy schemes in place. 
By 2015 Thailand had developed a decent share of renewables in primary energy 
production and more so when traditional biomass for cooking is included, as 
shown in Figure 3. In 2015 alone, modern renewable energy increased by 11.7% on 
a year-on-year basis – as much as four times the annual growth rate of the total 
primary energy supply. Of the total amount of renewable energy consumption 
in 2015 (10 306 ktoe), about 64% was used for heating, 16% for electricity 
generation, and nearly 20% for biofuel production.

As far as the power sector is concerned, installed 
renewable energy generating capacity has doubled 
over the past decade and seen a steeper ramp-up 
since 2012, as illustrated in Figure 9. Among the 
power mix, hydropower and bioenergy account for 
the lion’s share, while the share of solar PV and wind 
power has quickly caught up, attributed largely to 
the generous adder rates and favourable feed-intariffs (FITs) for these two technologies (details in 
section 3.2).
However, large-scale hydropower in Thailand 
reached almost 3 GW in 2000, which leaves little 
room for further development in view of its potential 
environmental impacts, while small hydropower has 
been on the rise but at a modest rate. Bioenergy 
has scaled up by a factor five over the same period. 
As regards solar PV, although the first solar PV 
farm, with a capacity of 504 kilowatts (kW), was 
installed by EGAT in 1996, the real take-off began 
in 2007 when favourable policy and regulatory 
schemes were put in place. Thailand started to 
exploit its wind energy as early as 1983 with several 
small wind turbines ranging from 1 kW to 150 kW in 
Phuket Island in southern Thailand, but the country 
has scaled up deployment at a modest growth rate 
due to the relatively low wind speed, especially in 
the areas close to load centres or transmission grids. 
Thailand has very modest geothermal potential 
in northern Thailand. In 1989, the first geothermal 
power generation facility with a capacity of only 
300 kW was built in the Fang District. However, the 
development of geothermal has since then been 
stagnant due to very little resource availability.
For non-power sectors, applications of renewable 
energy are concentrated in heating and transport. 
Heating applications of renewable energy are 
mostly adopted in industry and the buildings sector. 
In the buildings sector, the use of solid biomass 
for cooking (referred to as traditional biomass) 
represents a significant share of renewable energy 
use in Thailand. Since Thailand is abundant in 
agricultural products, biomass has been the 
fuel. Households in rural areas use biomass for 
cooking and heating purposes. An estimated 30% 
of the population (or 4 million households) still 
rely primarily on traditional bioenergy for cooking 
and heating. This practice is often associated with 
negative impacts on the quality of life of dwellers 
due to indoor air pollution and the time wasted 
gathering fuel. resource. Many small-scale plants focusing on agroprocessing and food processing use biomass fuel for 
their process heat. Larger-scale plants producing 
sugarcane, cassava and palm oil use biomass (both 
solid biofuels as well as biogas) in co-generation 
plants to produce heat and electricity mostly for 
their own consumption. Future expansion of heat 
applications using biomass in industry will come 
mainly from on-site co-generation plants. In 2015, 
biomass was used to provide 5 990 ktoe of heat for 
industry – an increase of 15.5% over the previous 
year – accounting for almost 60% of the renewable 
energy used in the country.
On transport fuels, Thailand has a strong 
motivation to replace petroleum-derived fuels with 
alternatives, given its high dependency on road 
transport as well as on the importation of gasoline 
and diesel for transport. Although the share of 
energy used for transport in TFEC remained in the 
region of 36% over 2005-15, the absolute amount 
of energy increased by 20% over the same period, 
reaching 28 501 ktoe in 2015, due to the growth 
in the number of vehicles and motorcycles. This 
increase in consumption also corresponded to the 
rising energy dependency ratio, as illustrated in 
Figure 2, indicating the dominance of petroleumderived transport fuels, accounting for more than 
two-thirds of the total energy consumption in the 
transport sector. Taking all liquid fuels into account, 
about 92% are consumed by the entire transport 
sector, 69% by road transport alone. Biofuel 
blending, namely gasohol and blended biodiesel, is 
now a common practice in Thailand after a decade 
of development. In 2015, the volumetric share of 
liquid transport fuel consumption that was met with 
biofuels stood at around 11% in the case of gasoline 
and 6% in the case of diesel. The overall volumetric 
share was close to 8%.
Gasohol covers E10 RON 91, E10 RON 95, 
E20 RON 95, and E85, among which E10 accounts 
for 80% while E85 for only 3.5%.22 For biodiesel 
blending, the maximum ratio was frozen at B7 in 2016, 
due largely to the supply constraints experienced 
in 2016, and to some extent the automobile 
industry was somewhat concerned about the risk 
that a continued increase in the blending ratio to 
B10 might challenge compliance with exhaust 
 3.2 Support programmes 
for renewable energy 
development
The Government of Thailand has long recognised 
the importance of alternative, especially renewable, 
energy sources, but also realised that there was 
a need to introduce programmes in support of 
renewable energy development and deployment. 
With that, a variety of support programmes have 
been put in place to promote renewable energy 
development, ranging from tax exemptions, a 
feed-in premium (FIP)/adder programme and FITs 
to competitive bidding, to address the various 
challenges that renewable energy projects face in 
the early stage of development.
The Thailand Board of Investment (BoI) is an 
institution established half a century ago with a 
mandate to promote investment, and was known as 
the Board of Industrial Investment until 1972. Since 
2004 it has provided alternative energy projects 
with support, mostly in the form of tax exemptions.
Examples include the following:
• Projects using waste, including refuse-derived fuel,
to produce electricity or steam are eligible for eightyear corporate income tax exemption without an
exemption cap, as well as exemption from import
duty on machinery, and other non-tax incentives.
• Other renewable energy projects that have an eightyear corporate income tax holiday, import duty
exemption on machinery and non-tax incentives,
include the manufacture of solar cells and/or raw
materials for solar cells, as well as power produced
from renewable energy sources, e.g. solar energy,
wind energy, biomass or biogas.
• Projects that target biofuel production from
agricultural products and by-products, for example
biomass to liquid (BTL) or biogas from wastewater,
are given an eight-year corporate income tax
holiday, import duty exemption on machinery and
raw or essential materials used in manufacturing
export products, as well as other non-tax incentives. 
• Projects aimed at biomass briquettes and pellets
are exempt for five years from corporate income
tax and import duty on machinery and other nontax incentivesBy June 2015, the BoI had approved 845 renewable 
energy projects, while an additional 93 projects 
were approved in 2016, as shown in Table 3. 
The FIP, known as the Adder Programme in 
Thailand, was approved by Cabinet in 2006 and put 
into effect in 2007. Under the Adder Programme, 
the premium rates added on top of wholesale 
electricity prices vary according to the technology 
and scale of installed capacity that SPPs or VSPPs 
adopt in their projects. 
The programme was designed for 10 years for solar 
PV and wind, and 7 years for biomass, biogas, MSW 
and mini/micro hydropower, starting from the COD 
with provision of an internal rate of return of 10-
12% for the project developers/investors. It jumpstarted the deployment of solar PV and wind power 
systems in Thailand from the outset. 
However, after three years of operation several 
disadvantages of the Adder Programme were 
identified, as listed below, which effectively 
triggered the policy change from the adder to 
FITs in Thailand. One of the key issues was the 
uncertainty associated with the computation of 
tariffs paid to the SPPs/VSPPs. Given that basic 
power tariffs and automatic tariff adjustment23 
vary with global energy commodity prices, the 
Adder Programme, building on such variables, 
The privileges granted to renewables investment 
demonstrate the degree of the government’s 
support for the sector.

causes some level of uncertainty in the long-term 
tariffs paid to investors/developers as well as the 
end users; in addition, it does not accurately reflect 
the levelised cost of energy (LCOE). Supported 
by this argument, the policy was shifted from the 
adder to the fixed FIT in 2013 to enhance investors’ 
confidence. However, because of the interruption 
in implementing the adder over 2010-13, concerns 
over policy consistency arose among the investors. 
Following the FIT scheme, and with drastic 
cost reductions for solar PV and onshore wind 
installations, the government has introduced a 
competitive bidding scheme with the FIT set as the 
ceiling price. This is aimed at allowing the market 
to determine the real prices at which renewable 
electricity should be paid. This would help the 
government minimise the risks of over-subsidising 
renewable energy projects. Thailand started testing 
the scheme with several pilot bioenergy projects in 
the southern regions in 2016-17, as a stepping stone 
towards nationwide adoption. The COD is expected 
to be reached in 2018, following postponement 
from the original estimate of 2017. 
23 Known as Ft in the calculation formula used in Thailand. 3.3 AEDP 2015: Observations and 
discussions24
Over the eight-year period from 2007 to 2015, 
Thailand revised its renewable energy targets four 
times. The most recent revision, which was made in 
2015, has set a target of 39 388 ktoe, representing 
30% of TFEC in 2036,25 with a breakdown shown 
in Table 4 below. It has raised the level of ambition 
compared with the previous targets, driven by 
the government’s strategic decision to replace 
imported primary and secondary energy sources, 
i.e. natural gas and electricity respectively, with 
indigenous energy sources – to a large degree from 
renewables.26
More profoundly, the extension of the planning 
timeframe from 10 to 20 years was an important 
revision as it provides investors and developers with 
a stable and consistent policy framework, allowing 
them to have a longer-term business plan. 
As shown in Table 4, the 2036 renewable energy 
target (30%) is distributed among: a) renewable 
electricity, which is expected to contribute 4.2% 
(5 588 ktoe), meeting approximately 20% of total 
electricity demand in 2036; b) renewables for 
thermal use, which are expected to account for 
19% (25 088 ktoe); and c) biofuels representing the 
24 Due to data limitations, this section does not assess the renewable
energy zoning development that is connected with the transmission grid 
expansion and grid stability study. 
25 Under the assumption of TFEC of 131 000 ktoe by 2036.
26 In Thailand, the target should be met only by indigenous renewable 
energy sources (excluding traditional renewables), indicating that 
imported renewable energy sources will not contribute to meeting the 
 target.
27 For the purpose of consistency in dataset, the estimates for 2021 made
by DEDE were used.
remaining 6.7% (8 712.43 ktoe). In terms of installed 
power generating capacity, solar PV is expected 
to meet 31% of the total with 15% from wind, and 
the remainder from biomass-based sources and 
hydropower stations. 
Figure 10 below shows the changes in the share 
of renewables respectively for power generation, 
thermal use/heating and transport in TFEC in 2015, 
2021 and 2036,27 based on the current data and 
estimations of DEDE. It indicates that renewables 
for thermal use would largely remain the same and 
consistently account for the lion’s share over the 
timeframe of AEDP 2015. Currently, electric vehicles 
play a very minor role in Thailand while transport 
biofuels are regarded as the prominent alternative 
to fossil-derived transport fuels. However, this 
might alter in future if the use of electric vehicles 
could gradually scale up.

over the next two decades, if AEDP 2015 were 
implemented as planned. To meet the target, total 
additional capacity of 11 721 MW would be required28
and be expected to deliver 46 902 GWh annually, 
assuming an overall capacity factor of 45.7%. As 
illustrated in Figure 11, bioenergy including solid 
biomass combustion, municipal waste and industrial 
waste, as well as biogas for electricity generation, 
account for the lion’s share of electricity output 
under this scenario, while their corresponding 
aggregated generating capacity would represent 
less than one-third of the total additional capacity. 
29 The pumped storage station, Lam Ta Kong, with the capacity of 500 MW,
 will double its capacity by 2018.

Note: The inner circle represents installed generating capacity that would be added from 2015 to 2036, while the outer circle represents 
the electricity to be produced by the additional electricity generating facilities in question. 
Several other observations merit further discussion 
and investigation: 
1. Large-scale hydropower (excluding pumped
storage29): the political decision was made
in the process of developing AEDP 2015 that
installed large hydro generating capacity should
remain at 2 906 MW with no further capacity to
be added due to environmental concerns. The
statistical data on electricity produced by large
hydropower was adjusted upwards from 694 
GWh to 3 409 GWh (equivalent to an increase 
from 59.7 ktoe to 290 ktoe) in March 2017. Even 
so, the capacity factor was extremely low for 
2015 compared to common practice. This can to 
some extent be explained by the data in Figure 
12, which show how hydroelectric production 
has been trending downwards since 2012. 
Provided feedstock sourcing is not an issue, biomassbased electricity generating facilities could generally 
provide a baseload with a relatively high capacity factor. 
By contrast, combined solar PV and wind capacity 
represent 63% of the total additional capacity to be 
installed over the same period, while the electricity 
output from these two sources accounts for only onequarter of the total, due to the lower capacity factors 
that these generating systems generally have. 
Therefore, it would be important to develop a 
portfolio of different renewable energy sources 
in the mix that can complement each other in 
terms of resource availability. This would help 
achieve a higher overall capacity factor, reduce the 
requirements placed on the reserve capacity, and 
thus minimise overall system costs.Based on the data in AEDP 2015, hydropower 
is forecast to generate an additional 
1 816 GWh in 2036 compared to the 2015 
reference year. On that basis, only 20% of the 
total capacity would be utilised in 2036. Taking 
into account the 1 000 MW of pumped storage 
capacity available by then, plenty of hydropower 
generating capacity should be available in 
2036 to use as regulating power when needed, 
especially in the scenario where the share of the 
variable energy sources such as solar PV and 
onshore wind power increase substantially in 
the power system.

2. Solar PV: the mid-term target (2021), set at
2 993 MW, appears to be met sooner, if not
already at the time of writing. The 2036 target
appears to require updating if this momentum
continues. By 2016 the majority of installations
had been utility-scale. However, rooftop solar PV
installations could scale up in future in response
to the constraints on land availability for utilityscale installations, which is already the case for
the Bangkok metropolitan area.
3. Geothermal: This energy source is missing from
AEDP 2015, which is understandable as Thailand
has quite modest geothermal resources with a
temperature range of 40-60°C, with some spots
reaching about 80°C. Even though the current
installation of 300 kW can be upgraded or
expanded to the magnitude of MW in the future,
it would nonetheless remain insignificant.
Electricity generation from 
biomass-based fuels
Thailand has traditionally been an agricultural 
economy. Even with the rising industrial and tourism 
sectors, agriculture remains important due to the 
large number of registered farmers that generally 
live in poor conditions. Therefore, the government 
has strong incentives to create opportunities for 
farmers to diversify their incomes with the aim of 
generating new streams of revenue, but also as a 
hedge against global food price volatility. Electricity 
generation from biomass, i.e. residue or energy 
crops, is a priority in Thailand. 
The biomass-fuelled electricity generation target in 
AEDP 2015 is the doubling of installed generating 
capacity, as shown in Table 4, and the increase in 
electricity production from biomass combustion 
by a factor of 2.6 from 1 104 ktoe to 2 911 ktoe. This represents nearly half of the total addition 
to renewable electricity by 2036, as illustrated in 
Figure 11. The targets for electricity generation 
from biomass in AEDP 2015 are divided into five 
components:
• solid biomass – 5 570 MW
• biogas – 600 MW
• biogas from energy crops – 680 MW
• MSW – 500 MW
• industrial waste – 50 MW
The solid biomass component is by far the most 
significant of all biomass-based electricity targets. It 
refers to the production of electricity in conventional 
steam power plants using solid biomass residues 
from biomass harvesting and processing, such as 
sugarcane bagasse, rice husks, empty fruit bunches 
and others. In most cases, these plants operate 
in co-generation mode for the production of 
both electricity and heat, and are associated with 
some other industrial operation that produces the 
biomass residues or has direct access to harvesting 
residues, such as a sugarcane mill or a palm oil 
plant. Independent power plants also obtain their 
biomass residues from third parties. 
A comprehensive list of biomass residues has 
been compiled by the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Cooperatives (MoAC) and DEDE, and is presented 
in Table 5. The figures presented in the table are 
the net amount made available for energy purposes 
only. The compilation indicates a potential of 
6 040 MW for electricity generation in 2036. The 
government is also considering additional sources, 
such as dedicated energy plantations.

Based on data from MoAC and DEDEGeographically, agricultural residues such as rice 
husk, cassava and bagasse are mostly distributed 
in the central, northern and northeastern regions, 
while oil palm residues exist largely in the southern 
provinces, according to the Office of Agricultural 
Economics of Thailand. 
Given the importance of solid biomass residues in 
AEDP 2015, the MoE has launched a nationwide 
survey of biomass potential for energy purposes, 
involving seven universities.30 The objective of the 
survey is to improve knowledge about the types and 
quantities of residues available, as many studies that 
were previously undertaken arrived at substantially 
different resource potentials depending on the 
methodology, approach/tool, assumptions and 
survey skills.
Regardless of what the results may be, three key 
challenges need to be addressed to sustain the 
supply of feedstocks for electricity generation. They 
are: 
1. To establish a fair and reasonable pricing
mechanism for residue collection, handling and
storage.
2. To develop the biomass supply chains needed
to ensure the collection and storage of a large
amount of biomass residues from dispersed
areas.
3. To co ordinate planning practices with MoAC
and the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment (MoNRE), in respect of land use
and the certainty of demand for biomass for
energy purposes.
These challenges are real for grid-connected 
large-scale power plants, as a significant part of 
the existing agricultural and forestry residues are 
treated as a commodity and their accessibility 
is subject to market conditions. The conflicting 
interest in the use of biomass feedstock between 
different sectors may cause concerns. 
In principle, MoAC welcomes any opportunity to 
diversify farmers’ income streams to hedge against 
price volatility in the food market by developing 
a stronger value chain for agricultural products 
and residues. This requires innovative pricing 
and energy. For biomass feedstocks for energy, an 
adequate pricing mechanism is one that considers 
the production costs, logistics, quality and 
opportunity costs. First and foremost, the pricing 
mechanism should be able to provide enough 
economic incentive to the biomass producer at 
levels that promote long-term engagement from the 
producer in the supply of biomass to the intended 
energy application, so that the costs of biomass 
production, collection and availability at the farm 
gate are covered. The pricing mechanism must 
also take into account the costs of transporting the 
biomass from the farm gate to the biomass user, 
if those costs are borne by the biomass producer. 
Certainly, the pricing mechanism must also beware 
of the opportunity costs of the biomass feedstock 
when alternative markets exist that might divert 
biomass to uses other than energy. Nonetheless, 
the bottom line is that food security for both human 
and animal/livestock must remain the top priority. 
MoAC is also responsible for safeguarding farmers’ 
overall economic interests. If designed and 
enforced well, multiple benefits can be achieved. 
For instance, much agricultural residue is burned 
on farmland, contributing to the air pollution 
problem. With regard to logistics and feedstock 
supply management, a good collection and 
handling infrastructure needs to be established 
in consideration of the ageing labour force in the 
agriculturalsector.31
A fair and sound regulatory framework should be put 
in place to ensure a fair distribution of the benefits 
between the farmers and the energy producers, 
particularly when deals go through processing 
collection companies (including agricultural co 
operatives that operate as a collector in some 
places), processing mills and other businesses 
involved. 
30 Including Chiang Mai University, Khon Kaen University, Suranaree
University of Technology, Kasetsart University, King Mongkut’s University 
of Technology Thonburi, Prince of Songkla University, and Chulalongkorn 
 University.
31 It has been increasingly difficult to sustain the farming labour force as the
would-be next generations of farmers prefer to work in cities. Most 
farmers are over 55 years old. These farmers would not be able to work 
hard enough to collect the residues even if the given price for residues 
were as high as THB 10 000 per tonne. The land reform programme aims 
to address the ageing issue by providing new generations of farmers with The production of electricity from dedicated 
energy crops (such as fuelwood) is still at an early 
phase. Whether it is necessary for the government 
to pursue this option remains uncertain until the 
ongoing survey of biomass potential is finished. The 
development of dedicated energy crops requires a 
careful assessment of the potential risks involved in 
the competition for scarce resources, such as land 
and water, which put pressure on other uses like 
food crops, livestock farming and forestry.
Electricity generation from biogas is another 
important component of AEDP 2015. The plan 
explicitly considers two areas: the production of 
biogas from biomass wastes and the use of energy 
crops for biogas production. In the first case, AEDP 
2015 plans to increase the installed capacity of 
biogas-to-electricity from the existing 400 MW to 
600 MW. And in the second, no plants are currently 
installed and the plan is to have 680 MW of installed 
capacity by 2036.
Traditionally, biogas production in Thailand has been 
promoted as a win-win solution to treat the wastes 
from livestock production (poultry, pigs and cattle), 
wastewaters from food processing industries, 
sewage, and a proportion of agricultural residues 
by applying anaerobic digestion technology 
(DEDE, 2012a). 
Improvements to the existing biogas generation 
systems are likely to be an option, for instance by 
increasing biogas generation and reducing methane 
losses in anaerobic digesters. According to existing 
data, the use of biogas for electricity generation 
is currently operating at a capacity factor of 32%. 
Considering only the capacity additions in AEDP 
2015 and the electricity generation associated with 
them, the capacity factor of the new additions would 
be close to 130%, which is clearly not possible. This 
indicates that either the planned capacity additions 
are not sufficient to meet the electricity generation 
goals, or that the current biogas facilities would 
have to be upgraded or operate for longer hours 
than they are now, to achieve the overall average 
capacity factor of 69% in 2036. 
With the growth in industrialised livestock 
production, especially the increasing demand for 
importation ban by many countries and regions, 
the amount of poultry wastes is duly expected to 
increase. This will in turn provide more feedstock 
for biogas production. In existing industries 
such as bioethanol, vinasse (a residue from wine 
distillation) represents very significant potential for 
use in biogas production. Co-digestion of vinasse 
and filter cake (another residue from sugarcane 
processing) is a further promising option. 
In parallel, a sub-target of 680 MW electricity 
generation from biogas produced from energy 
crops was also set in AEDP 2015. The aim was 
to scale up biogas production from alternative 
resources. This was based on the research results 
under DEDE’s supervision on biogas production 
from Napier grass, also known as “elephant grass” 
– a fodder with a high level of protein, fat and
carbon, making it suitable for anaerobic digestion
(DEDE, 2012b).32
The use of energy crops for biogas production is 
no different from other applications of dedicated 
energy crops. Energy cropping is a legitimate way 
to secure biomass feedstocks that can be used not 
only for biogas production, but also in biomass 
boilers to generate electricity and/or heat, and 
can also be converted into liquid and gaseous 
biofuels through thermochemical process such 
as gasification or pyrolysis. However, it must be 
considered carefully in a broader context of land 
use development because it introduces further 
pressure on land and water resources, especially 
given the emphasis on energy crops for bioethanol 
and biodiesel production.
A further priority under bioelectricity is MSW. 
MSW is a national priority while bioenergy is often 
viewed as a by-product. The volume of MSW has 
been increasing, along with the growing population, 
improved living standards and the expanding 
tourism industry in Thailand, according to the 
Pollution Control Department of Thailand. In 2015, 
about 73 560 tonnes of MSW were generated per 
day (PCD, 2016), representing nearly a 9% increase 
on 2012, stretching the country’s waste disposal 
capabilities (Suthapanich, 2014). 
32 According to the DEDE research programme
70120 cubic metres ofIn this context, the target for WTE from MSW was 
raised to 500 MW in AEDP 2015 from 160 MW in 
the previous AEDP 2012-21. It should be noted that 
with the support of the Adder Programme,33 83% 
of the previous 2021 target was met by 2015. It can 
then be extrapolated that the 2036 target for MSW 
would be exceeded by 15%. This could be a very 
reasonable scenario when factoring in the mounting 
pressure on municipal waste management – the 
key driver for MSW-based WTE. Nevertheless, MSW 
WTE would account only for a small proportion of 
the future energy mix. 
Solar PV
Thailand is endowed with abundant solar energy 
resource across the country, with high irradiance 
in the northeast and central parts of the country 
covering one-quarter of the total land area, 
as illustrated in Figure 13. The peak density of 
solar radiation in those areas is in the range of 33 At the rate of 2.50 THB/kWh for seven years.
1 200-1 400 kilowatt hours (kWh) per square metre 
per year, with seasonal peak in April and low point 
in December. (DEDE, 2012c).
To develop this potential into electricity generating 
capacity would require the alignment of other 
variables, including transmission capacity, 
availability of suitable land, load profile, grid 
flexibility and a suitable regulatory framework. In 
view of the variability and potential complementarity 
of different forms of renewables such as solar, wind, 
biomass and hydropower, the sector has evolved 
from a single-source renewable energy development 
model into a region/zone-based model, also known 
as the “renewable energy zoning” approach. In 
Thailand, EGAT has been working in collaboration 
with the MoE on this in connection with the 
development of the transmission networks.

Figure 13. Thailand solar energy resource potentialOver the past five years, Thailand’s total installed 
solar PV generating capacity has increased tenfold, 
as shown in Figure 14. This remarkable achievement 
can be attributed to the attractive premiums offered 
under the country’s Adder Programme, the dramatic 
As of December 2016, Thailand has nearly doubled 
the 2015 reference point used for AEDP 2015 by 
reaching solar PV installations of 2 446 MW (already 
in operation as defined by the COD record), of 
which 95% are from ground-mounted utility-scale 
installations. Another 307 MW are in the process of 
reaching COD. The industry expects to see another 
surge in solar PV installations in 2017, based on 
the pipeline of projects and the potential new 
rounds of tendering for SPPs and VSPPs, activity 
in the rooftop solar PV market and the continued 
reduction in costs, including savings from simplified 
administrative procedures. 
The indications and implications of such rapid 
growth and continued momentum on the AEDP 
2015 solar target are briefly discussed below: 
• Total installations are already half way
to reaching the 2036 solar PV target of
6 000 MW, suggesting there is room for
increasing the target. The estimated addition is
global decline in the cost of PV modules and utilityscale PV projects, and growing acceptance of solar 
PV projects especially in the financial sector, and 
most importantly the consistent political support 
for renewable energy development.

Figure 14. Thailand’s cumulative solar PV installed generating capacity, 2002-2016
Based on data from DEDE and ERC
Note: 2016 data as of September
• Grid stability has not become a major issue with
the share of variable renewable energy (VRE)
sources34 in the power mix estimated at about
1.5%. However, MoE has taken precautionary
actions in this regard by demanding that new
project developers provide semi-firm or firm
capacity – essentially a hybrid system based
primarily on biomass-derived power, hybridised
with solar PV or wind – as seen in the Box below.
In addition, NEPC has approved establishing 
a merit of order in AEDP 2015 – a priority list 
for grid integration of renewable electricity 
generating capacity ranked against the impact 
on grid stability from least to highest, i.e. MSW, 
solid biomass, biogas from wastes and waste 
water, small-scale hydropower, biogas from 
energy crops, wind, solar PV, and geothermal. 
34 Including wind power
which is currently at a much smaller scale• SPPs and VSPPs dominate the solar PV market
and will most likely continue to dominate for the
next two decades; by contrast, EGAT’s ultimate
contribution to solar PV would be expected to be
below 3% in 2036. This is partly because under
the enhanced single buyer power market, EGAT
as the transmission system operator is obligated
to completely purchase any electricity generated
using renewable energy. By not being heavily
involved in VRE generation, EGAT keeps a neutral
position in respect of grid constraint issues such
as the necessary curtailment. However, given that
the share of natural gas in the power mix would
nearly halve from the current level of 67% in the
PDP 2015, EGAT has planned to scale up biomass
electricity generation,35 coal-fired thermal power,
imported hydropower and other sources to fill
the gap such a reduction may create.
• The rooftop solar PV market remains largely
untapped. New business models using PV as
part of an energy efficiency programme for
buildings to lower electricity bills could speed
up the adoption of rooftop solar PV. However,
unlocking its potential, especially in the Bangkok
metropolitan area which has about one-third
of the total national power demand but little
land available for ground-mounted solar
PV deployment, would still require stronger
engagement from MEA and PEA in addressing
the challenges this sub-sector faces. This is
discussed in the following paragraphs.
35 At present, EGAT plans to deploy 2 082 MW of biomass power generating 
 capacity. However, this internal target is likely to be updated once EGAT 
completes its survey of biomass feedstock and the need for additional 
 transmission capacity.
Non-firm, semi-firm and firm 
electricity generating capacity
in Thailand
In the current power purchasing agreements for SPPs and VSPPs, two types of contract are 
applicable for power plants with firm and non-firm capacity, respectively. VRE sources often 
fit into the latter, as the electricity production from solar or wind varies with the availability of 
the resources. 
Firm capacity refers to those who can provide power for a whole year, while semi-firm capacity 
is defined as 100% availability of dispatchable power generation capacity during 08:00-22:00, 
with 65% of the total capacity during 23:00-07:00 for every day over the four peak months 
(March-June) in a year. Non-firm capacity refers to those who can provide power for the rest 
of the year. 
There is a policy change for FIT bidding requirements. Only those SPPs and VSPPs who can 
provide firm and semi-firm generating capacity from renewable energy sources will be eligible. 
Hybrid systems are encouraged.
Source: Department of Energy, 2017Presently, rooftop solar PV in Thailand plays a 
very small role due largely to the following key 
challenges.
Overall, Thailand lacks a dedicated target for rooftop 
solar PV development. In addition, for residential 
households the incentives are less attractive 
as rooftop solar PV can only be used for selfconsumption, due partly to the lack of net-metering 
schemes. This basically eliminates the potential use 
by residential households as they are mostly not 
at home to use the electricity during the daytime. 
For commercial and industrial users the story is 
different, as rooftop solar PV can match their load 
profile. In general, more economic incentives should 
be provided for rooftop solar PVs. 
For connection to the distribution networks, PEA and 
MEA have set a ceiling of 15% of the transformer’s 
capacity with the intention to minimise the risk of 
interfering with power quality for other customers. 
Yet this limits the potential for VSPPs to develop 
rooftop PV for commercial and industrial users 
unless effective energy management can be put in 
place, including battery energy storage systems.36 
Following the appropriate grid stability analysis, 
PEA and MEA may opt to raise the threshold.
Wind power
Thailand has wind potential according to an average 
wind speed of 6 metres per second (m/s) measured 
at a height of 90 metres, as shown in Figure 15. 
Based on recent wind potential assessment results 
that were endorsed by DEDE, technical potential 
can reach 13 GW in 21 areas across the country. The 
greatest wind potential is geographically located 
in the northeast, western and southern regions of 
Thailand, which are generally far away from the 
loads. A study by Manomaiphiboon et al. (2017) 
has shown that Thailand has technical wind energy 
potential up to 17 GW if modern low-speed wind 
turbines are used, and yet only one-third of this 
can be realised if conventional wind turbines are 
adopted instead. This partly explains the huge gap 
between the 13 GW wind potential and the wind 
power target of 3 GW set in AEDP 2015, and also 
suggests that how soon the 2036 target for wind 
can be achieved would to a large extent depend 
upon the selected wind turbine technology, the 
installation location and the hub height. 
36 The application of battery energy storage systems in Thailand is in its
infancy, despite EPPO since October 2016 providing grants as high as 
about USD 23 million to support research and development (R&D) 
projects on battery technology through its ENCON Fund. As of July 2017, 
32 projects had been approved with the total planned disbursement of 
USD 8.95 million.

Figure 15. Wind potential map for Thailand at 90 metresIn respect of offshore wind potential along the 
coast of the Gulf of Thailand, Waewsak et al. (2015) 
highlighted that the total offshore wind potential 
stands in the magnitude of 7 GW, nearly half of 
which is in the Bay of Bangkok – the northernmost 
part of the Gulf of Thailand. Under the assumption 
of a capacity factor at 24%, total electricity 
production from this estimated capacity would 
reach 15 terawatt hours (TWh) per year. 
Thailand utilised wind energy to generate electricity 
as early as 1983 when the first three turbines with 
a capacity of 1 kW, 10 kW, and 150 kW, respectively, 
were installed at the Phromthep Alternative Energy 
Station on Phuket Island. By 2015, Thailand had 
reached a total capacity of 234 MW, most of which 
was in the northeast as shown in Table 6. This 
doubled the 2012 level, representing an annual 
average growth rate of 30%, and the rapid growth 
continued throughout 2016.
According to the implementation plan for AEDP 
2015, the annual growth rate would expect to slow 
to an average of 12-13% over the next two decades, 
as illustrated in Figure 16. Like solar PV projects, 
most of the wind projects will be developed by the 
private sector – IPPs, SPPs and VSPPs – while EGAT 
plans to limit its contribution to less than 6% of total 
wind power generating capacity by 2036. 
However, whether wind power development in Thailand 
evolves as planned will largely depend on how the 
current land use or acquisition challenges facing wind 
project developers can be satisfactorily resolved.

Several cross-cutting issues could have a significant 
impact on whether and how the renewable energy 
target for power generation could be achieved by 
2036. The following paragraphs discuss some of 
the key points identified through the consultative 
process. 
Key factors in PDP 2015 affecting AEDP 2015
As briefly discussed in the previous section, TIEB 
took a unique approach to interconnect all five 
energy-related development plans in a synchronised 
timeframe. Under the framework of PDP 2015, AEDP 
2015 has been closely linked with the EEP target, i.e. 
an energy intensity reduction of 30% in 2036 from 
the 2010 level. In absolute terms, it means a total 
amount of 51 700 ktoe should be saved through 
energy conservation and efficiency improvement 
measures in all sectors over the course of the next 
two decades, 85% of which would be expected to 
occur in the thermal sector. This interlinked target 
could bring some uncertainty in respect of meeting 
the renewable target set, as TFEC in 2036 could 
change. 
Another important factor is how the development 
of other sources of power generation, notably 
natural gas and coal-fired power generation, could 
affect renewables. In PDP 2015, the target was set 
to reduce the share of natural gas from the current 
64% to 37% in 2036, while the share of coal power 
would rise from the current 20% to 23%. Whether 
these two sub-targets can be achieved would 
greatly depend on the long-term security of supply 
of natural gas at affordable prices and the public 
acceptance of coal power that is now under fire. 
Proactive power grid development planning
EGAT has realised the importance of integrating 
future renewable electricity generators into the 
power grid development plan. As stipulated in 
PDP 2015, EGAT has the obligation to purchase all 
the electricity generated from renewable energy 
sources. This requires EGAT to upgrade and 
expand its transmission networks to be capable 
of accommodating a growing share of VRE from, 
for instance, solar and wind. For example, the 
interconnection between central and southern 
capacity to 1 000 MVA with a 500 kV voltage 
level. By 2023, EGAT will be able to provide an 
additional 5 180 MW of transmission capacity in the 
northeastern, northern, central and southern regions 
to accommodate renewable electricity generation 
of up to 12 GW. It is planned to add another 19 GW 
after that. But the PDP is supposed to be reviewed 
every four years or so, and the planned target after 
2023 might be updated in the next review. 
The plan developed by EGAT was based on the 
two studies it conducted in collaboration with the 
MoE, i.e. the grid stability assessment using the 
PowerFactory model, and the development of 
renewable energy development zones in connection 
with the plan for power grid expansion and 
enhancement. Despite the fact that the results are 
presently not available to the public, some general 
observations can be drawn from the discussion of 
the procedures. They include the following:
• As regards zoning practice, it appears that EGAT
gave priority to biomass while other renewable
energy sources were built into the plan based
on the biomass-centric modelling results. This
would miss the optimisation of different types
of renewable energy sources, notably wind and
solar due to their potential complementarity,
and matching with load profiles (although total
power demand is considered).
• The grid stability study was conducted in
two steps, i.e. running the simulation on the
existing and planned conventional generators
and transmission grid data without variable
renewables, and then with the variable
renewables examining how much the grid can
accommodate and where the weak points
would be at various disruption events to devise
the enhancement plan and the operational
procedures. However, without the inputs from
the distribution networks, the final simulation
results can only be sub-optimal.
Regional power grid interconnections
In addition to the existing interconnections with 
neighbouring countries, Thailand has approximately 
22-25 GW of cross-border transmission capacity
planned to be built by 2025, as shown inGrid Initiative, which is facing significant challenges 
in respect of attractiveness of investment. Therefore, 
how feasible it is for these projects to be developed 
by 2025 remains unclear. 
Nevertheless, Thailand is making efforts and 
investments in its neighbouring countries, mostly 
Lao PDR and Myanmar for importing hydropower 
and possibly coal power. In accordance with 
the eligibility of renewable energy sources for 
compliance with the renewable energy target in 
AEDP 2015, the imported renewable electricity is 
not accounted.

Regulatory framework and potential power market 
reform
The recently proposed renewable energy promotion 
plan by EPPO, requiring all SPPs and VSPPs to 
provide firm or semi-firm capacity in their renewable 
energy projects, aims to reduce the requirement 
for grid flexibility and thus ultimately support the 
implementation of AEDP 2015. It would also increase 
the challenge that developers are facing, although 
some of the big players seem to be prepared for 
this change by making strategic acquisitions. In 
general, this new plan will push costs upwards on the 
developer side. The plan is now under discussion and 
is expected to be launched in 2017. 
Worldwide, the high penetration rates of VRE could 
pose greater challenges for grid operators, and thus 
incentivise them to place technical requirements on 
developers. However, other options can be explored, 
for instance, matching VRE outputs with load as 
much as possible using intelligent control systems, 
including adopting more advanced demand-side 
management schemes. Increasingly, marketoriented tools are gaining popularity in addressing 
the frequent regulation of frequency and voltages in 
a system with a high share of VRE, as presented in 
the report Adapting Market Design to High Shares 
of Variable Renewable Energy (IRENA, 2017a). For 
the system has a large number of gas turbines and 
hydropower stations.
Renewable energy for heating: industrial, 
commercial and residential
In 2036, renewables for heating are expected to 
account for 37% of the total heating demand, 
representing a more than doubling of their share 
from the 2015 level, according to AEDP 2015. As 
illustrated in Figure 10, their share of the renewable 
portfolio remains unchanged at approximately 
64%. However, given that the share of renewables 
in TFEC is expected to increase from the current 
10% or so to 30% in 2036, the contribution of 
renewables in the heating sector would grow 
substantially in absolute terms, estimated at 
18 509 ktoe as shown in the Table 4 – fivefold the 
amount of renewable electricity generation. As much 
as 85% of the increment would be expected to come 
from biomass, followed by biogas and solar thermal, 
yet to a significantly lesser extent, as shown in 
Figure 17. The category of biomass covers both 
biomass residues and dedicated energy crops. A 
significant part of that biomass is expected to be 
used in co-generation plants, contributing to both 
heat and electricity generation. Solar thermal 
covers the applications of solar water heaters Unlike power generation and transport fuels from 
renewable energy sources, renewables for heating 
lack a clear roadmap. This issue can be attributable 
to the following causes:
• Biomass, in the form of residues and wastes,
has traditionally been used for process heat
in the agricultural and forestry sectors. For
instance, more than 80% of the process heat in
the sugar, pulp and paper, rice milling, timber,
and palm oil industries is provided by biomass
residues and wastes. Unless their production
capacity increases, the use of biomass in those
industries can hardly increase. However, the
unused biomass residues from those industries
could be utilised by other industries should
the technological challenges be addressed
and incentives be provided. In fact, biomass
currently offers the only real renewable
technology alternative to fossil-fuel-based
high-temperature process heat generation
(IRENA, 2014b). Few other renewable sources
can provide the high-temperature process heat
that many industries need.
• A related issue is that there is no programme
to evaluate how much biomass residue could
be used by other industrial users for energy

Figure 17. Increment of renewables for heating in 2036 from 2015 in Thailand
Based on data in the DEDE (2015) Alternative Energy Development Plan
addressed with the appropriate level of policy 
and regulatory interventions. This includes a 
pricing mechanism to be devised for biomass 
feedstocks, as discussed in the previous chapter. 
• Most of the industrial facilities that can potentially 
use biomass for process heat are large-scale,
centralised plants operating at economies of
scale, which will require large energy flows to be
brought from within and across national borders. 
The key factors defining the economic viability of 
biomass are: its energy density, production costs, 
the distance it needs to be transported, and the
type of transport mode. Cost-competitiveness
of biomass can be maintained through an
effective logistics infrastructure as consumption
increases. Therefore, it is essential to support
the development of biomass supply chains that
ensure the delivery of reliable, high-quality and
affordable biomass fuels to those industries that
are willing to use biomass. The development of
such supply chains would benefit not only heat
applications, but also electricity production and
more importantly combined heat and power.
Focus on those supply chains should be another
priority in the development of the AEDP.
• The competition for biomass from powermanner to ensure that enough resources are 
available and that no competition develops that 
could hinder the development of bioenergy 
in those sectors. The use of the scarce solid 
biomass resources, especially agricultural 
residues, that will be available in the AEDP time 
frame should be prioritised. Mechanisms should 
be put in place that ensure the development of 
a healthy and sustainable biomass market that 
serves those end users that will maximise the 
production of both electricity and heat, as well 
as those that have few other renewable energy 
options, such as for high-temperature heat 
applications.
• Coal use by industrial users has more than
doubled during 2000-2014, reaching 12 million
tonnes and accounting for 47% of total coal
consumption in 2014. The year 2014 alone saw a
23% increase. The remaining 53% was consumed
by the power sector, in which SPP consumption
remained stable over the same period, while
IPPs tripled their consumption since 2006
(EPPO, 2015).37 In this context, how much coal
can be substituted by renewables may be a
worthwhile question to study. This could be
even more appealing and sensible in view of
the current strong public objection to coal
combustion, notably the case of the 850 MW
coal power plant in Krabi province in the south
of the country. Yet, should biomass replace coal,
there could also be an institutional challenge as
the lignite mines and import of coal are managed 
by EGAT, while biomass feedstocks are under
the oversight of MoAC and MoNRE.
• Renewables for heating lack a proven business
case due mostly to the fact that the technology
has been largely overlooked worldwide. It
has just recently been realised that renewable
energy use in the heating sector could provide
huge potential for meeting the growing demand. 
A wider range of applications exist for renewable 
heating in the industrial sector, such as water heating 
for laundries, cooking, food drying and sterilisation, 
process heating and preheating of effluents in 
combustion systems. Solar heating, geothermal 
(low to medium temperatures) or ground-level 
resources, and biomass can potentially provide 
renewable energy for these heating purposes. 
In Thailand, solar water heating does not appear 
to be widely used in the residential sector, but it 
may be an appealing option for hotels given that 
Thailand’s tourism industry is well developed and 
continues to grow. Solar drying systems can be 
used in the agricultural sector for food drying. 
However, this would require studies to look 
further into the feasibility of the two potential 
applications, followed by a promotional scheme/
strategy. 
More importantly is the urgent need to establish a 
statistical system for non-power renewable energy 
sources, on which basis the right set of policies 
and incentive schemes for the use of renewables 
in sectors other than just electricity could be 
developed. 
Renewables for transport
As indicated in Figure 10, the share of renewables 
for transport in Thailand’s total renewable energy 
use is expected to increase by 2036. Biofuels, i.e. 
biodiesel and bioethanol, account for two-thirds 
of the total renewables anticipated to be used in 
the transport sector in 2036, as shown in Figure 18. 
Compressed biogas could fill much of the remaining 
one-third, greatly depending upon the roll-out 
of technology and the infrastructure (refilling 
stations). AEDP 2015 also introduces pyrolysis 
oil as a new option in transport fuels Although it 
contributes a much smaller share of transport 
energy demand, this initiative moves in the right 
direction of diversification of transport fuels using 
new and promising conversion technologies.

To meet the corresponding target through the current 
commercially viable technologies, feedstock does not 
generally appear to be a major roadblock, but must 
be considered with caution. The volatile yield of palm 
oil, subject to the climate and weather conditions, 
could potentially pose a challenge. For bioethanol, the 
potential of cassava as feedstock is under discussion 
in the context that sugarcane might at some point 
reach its limit. Another option is to convert some lowyield rice fields into sugarcane farms. 
Concerns over the guaranteed long-term demand 
for feedstock must be addressed to sustain the 
supply. Therefore, some level of guarantee on longterm demand and purchase price may be needed. 
This would help minimise the negative impact of oil 
price volatility on the farming economy, and in return 
enhance farmers’ confidence in investing in energy 
crops. Additionally, prices should, in principle, be 
stable or predictable over the long term, and should 
not be set too high or too low in relation to food prices. 
Biomass feedstocks (cassava, molasses) represent 
over 70% of ethanol costs and a similar situation holds 
for biodiesel. This is sufficient reason to pay close 
attention to stable and reliable biomass supply. 
Looking forward, the future generation of biofuels 
could greatly increase potential supply without 
creating further pressure on land and water use. The 
move in that direction. Advanced liquid biofuels 
can be refined from a range of sources. These 
include agricultural residues associated with food 
crops, as well as forest residues like sawdust from 
lumber production. Other sources include nonfood energy crops, such as the rapidly growing 
grasses switchgrass and miscanthus, and shortrotation tree species like poplar and eucalyptus. 
These emerging options provide a wider range of 
feedstock for production of biofuels for transport, 
while mitigating sustainability risks associated 
with changing land use and competition over food 
production. Residues do not compete with food 
or lumber production but grow alongside it. Highyielding grasses and trees can grow more energy 
per unit of land area than conventional biofuel 
crops, potentially mitigating the impact of any 
land use change. As IRENA’s innovation outlook 
indicates, the production costs of advanced biofuels 
are declining. And innovation may further reduce 
the cost of advanced biofuel production by up to a 
third over the next three decades. 
Thailand has considered bio-compressed natural 
gas (CNG), i.e. purified biogas, as one option for 
alternative transport fuel in AEDP 2015 and has 
set a target of producing 4 800 tonnes per day 
by 2036. However, it is important to provide clear 
signals that the infrastructure and supply chains will gaseous fuels, such as compressed biogas, is only 
widely adopted if there is confidence that the fuel 
will be available in a sustained manner over large 
areas of the country. It is often preferred that 
compressed biogas is adopted in captive fleets, 
such as taxis, buses and transport companies, such 
that fuel demand and refuelling locations can be 
planned under the control of the fleet operator. 
The development of compressed biogas will 
also require significant expansion of the existing 
capacity of biogas production and upgrading. In 
addition to anaerobic digesters, the production 
of compressed biogas requires upgrading plants 
that turn biogas into compressed biogas, which 
entails the development of adequate technology 
suppliers and technologies for long-term operation. 
A distribution network to ensure that the fuel will 
reach its end-use markets is also essential, taking 
into consideration the geographic distribution 
of compressed biogas production and existing 
gas pipelines. Quality standards for blending 
compressed biogas with natural gas should also be 
developed from the early stages of the programme.
Discussion on biofuel and electric vehicles
The topic of alternatives to petroleum-derived fuels 
for vehicles has been hotly debated in Thailand, 
largely because the automobile industry contributes 
10-11% of Thailand’s GDP, and provides 800 000 
jobs for the country. Around 60% of production 
is for the global market while 40% of the vehicles 
made in Thailand are for the domestic market. 
It is therefore a very important industrial sector 
for Thailand’s economy and deserves continued 
attention and discussion regarding the direction of 
its future development. 
At present, the consensus tends to recognise that 
Thailand needs more than just one type of transport 
fuel, while diversification should also be limited in 
view of the costs associated with the infrastructure 
transition needed. Biofuels, even at times of high oil 
prices, can hardly meet the demand for the whole 
transport sector, due to supply constraints on the 
feedstock. 
While it is likely that electricity will be common for 
two- and three-wheeled forms of road transport, 
four-wheel vehicles can be powered by biofuels and 
However, local industry needs to be considered. 
Roughly half of the domestic market for 
automobiles – 800,000 units per year – are diesel 
vehicles, with the other half gasoline. The country 
has been blending E10, E20 and E85 for gasoline 
cars, while for biodiesel, B7 blending is currently 
applied. While the automobile industry in Thailand 
has yet to start to produce electric vehicles (EVs) 
in quantity, it is open to the development of EV 
manufacturing capacity in future as it has witnessed 
the revolutionary technological breakthroughs 
that have occurred over recent years. At present, 
potential policy uncertainty and lack of long-term 
clarity in terms of technological pathway for the 
transport sector are recognised as the greatest 
challenges. Therefore, the industry is requesting 
that policy makers provide a perspective on where 
the market could develop. 
In this context, the National Innovation System 
Development Committee, chaired by the Prime 
Minister, has approved the Roadmap for EV 
development in Thailand. It includes three strategic 
development stages: a) making the infrastructure 
ready, particularly in public transport; 2) using EVs 
for public transport while at the same time making 
the infrastructure ready for personal vehicles; 3) 
scaling up the use of the EVs for personal use. In 
parallel, EVs are also incorporated in the National 
Energy Efficiency Action Plan as a means to reduce 
the consumption of petroleum-based transport fuels. 
For public transport, Thailand is focusing on 
replacing the conventional two- and three-wheelers 
(tuk-tuks38) with e-motorcycles not only to address 
the environmental issues in cities, but also to avoid 
challenging the market share of four-wheelers. 
In 2016, EPPO set up a subsidised scheme to establish 
100 charging stations nationwide for infrastructure 
readiness and to increase public awareness of EVs. 
EPPO plans to replace 22 000 conventional tuk-tuks 
with electric tuk-tuks within 5 years. The first 100 
electric tuk-tuks will be piloted in 2017-18 with the 
support of the ENCON Fund. Details of the subsidy 
are still under consideration as are the standards for 
electric tuk-tuks for safety purposes. Apart from the intended effort in promoting EVs 
in Thailand, MEA, PEA, EGAT and Bangkok Mass 
Transit Authority (BMTA) have set up plans for 
promoting electric public buses as part of their 
support to address urban transport issues as well 
as to implement Thailand’s Industry 4.0 strategy. 
MEA will install charging stations for BMTA’s pilot 
electric buses. PEA will install charging stations 
with both normal and fast charging capabilities at 
Suvarnabhumi Airport as well as public buses for 39 A public transport system in Bangkok
Pattaya Airport. Nation-wide, PEA plans to install 
11 public charging stations for EVs in 2017 and then 
scale up the number to 74 by 2019 to cover more 
service areas. EGAT will provide electric buses and 
a charging station for visitors to its Smart Grid for 
EV Demand Management Learning Center. PTT also 
provides electric bus from its headquarters to the 
nearest Skytrain station.39RENEWABLE 
ENERGY 
OUTLOOKThe previous chapters have outlined the energy context of Thailand, and provided 
a view on how the country’s energy landscape will change over the next two 
decades based on government plans and targets in the TIEM, and specifically 
the AEDP. However, Thailand’s energy system is highly dynamic as evidenced 
by how the AEDP has been revised and updated four times in the last couple of 
decades due to changing market dynamics and priorities for the country and its 
longer-term energy goals. Whereas the RRA approach detailed in the previous 
chapter is focused on analysing policy and institutional frameworks to assist 
countries in the deployment of renewables, based on current or planned policies 
and targets, IRENA’s REmap analysis presented in this chapter provides a view on 
the longer-term potential of renewables in a country’s energy mix and identifies 
where renewable energy could be scaled up beyond what countries are planning.
This chapter evaluates the additional potential for renewable energy technologies 
(“REmap Options”) in Thailand’s end-use sectors of industry, buildings and 
transport, as well as for power generation. The REmap Options assess renewable 
potential on top of the Reference Case, which is aligned with the AEDP 2015 
targets. This section therefore provides a view on where Thailand can expand 
renewables even further, and what the associated cost and benefit of such 
an expansion would be. For more information about the REmap approach, 
methodology and sources please see Annex: REmap methodology, assessment 
approach and data sources.
04The process for deriving the REmap Options, 
simplified, is as follows:
• A Reference Case to the year 2036 was
developed based on forecasts submitted by
Thailand and developed in co-ordination with
experts during consultations and workshops.
This case represents a current or expected
policies scenario, is broadly in line with targets
set forth in AEDP 2015, and is considered the
baseline case of the analysis.
• The additional renewable energy options for
the end-use sectors and the power sector
were analysed based on various studies and
assessments, consultation with experts from
Thailand during the numerous workshops and
meetings, and IRENA analysis.
• Fuel prices were forecast based on existing
literature and IRENA estimates; and technology
cost and performance criteria (e.g. capacity
factors) were estimated to reflect conditions
particular to Thailand.
• The REmap case is created to reflect how
the REmap Options change the Reference
Case in order to accelerate renewable energy
deployment. The results of these Options are
then quantified in terms of their costs, investment 
needs, and benefits resulting from lower levels
of air pollution, carbon dioxide (CO2
) emissions
and other impacts.
Figure 19 provides an overview of the key cases 
discussed in this chapter, and the years that will be 
highlighted. This chapter will focus first on presenting 
developments that are likely to occur in the Reference 
Case based on current or expected policies contained 
in AEDP 2015. Next the chapter will go into depth 
on the accelerated potential of renewable energy 
beyond what is expect to occur in the Reference 
Case. These accelerated possibilities are called the 
REmap Options, and the resulting high-renewables 
case is called the REmap case. Two future years 
will be highlighted: 2025 to provide a perspective 
relevant to the ASEAN regional target for renewable 
energy; and 2036 to provide a perspective relevant 
to Thailand’s national policy making and AEDP 2015.

Figure 19. Overview of key year milestones for REmap and case description4.1 Reference Case 
The Reference Case represents a view on energy 
supply and demand based on current or planned 
policies. For the analysis, the Reference Case is 
based on energy demand and supply forecasts 
submitted by Thailand in a data questionnaire and 
then refined through a series of consultations and 
workshops. The result is a Reference Case that is 
broadly in line with expected developments as 
detailed by Thailand’s AEDP. 
The development of this case as the most likely 
development pathway for Thailand’s energy system 
to 2036 is based on an understanding that Thailand 
is firmly committed to reaching energy targets 
and goals as set out in AEDP 2015 and TIEB. The 
government has a long history of comprehensive 
and planned energy blueprints and strategies, 
and institutional processes and mechanisms that 
work towards achieving the aims set out in these 
comprehensive plans. 
Also, by aligning the Reference case with AEDP 
2015, the REmap analysis can focus on identifying 
additional and accelerated renewable potential that 
goes beyond the targets that are currently part of 
this plan. As the AEDP has been revised numerous 
times over the past decade, this REmap analysis can 
provide a view on where the additional potential 
of renewables lies, with the aim of informing the 
Government of Thailand as to where new efforts 
and focus are needed.
This chapter does not go into detail on specific 
developments of the Reference Case or AEDP, as 
these developments and goals are detailed in depth 
in the TIEB and AEDP discussions in Chapters 2 
and 3. However, some key changes in energy and 
economic indicators are discussed, and key energy 
shares and developments for the Reference Case 
are overviewed in the following sections. 
Economic and energy demand 
developments
• Over the period from 2015 to 2036 demand
for energy will increase by 78%. Fossil fuel
consumption will increase by almost 65%.
However, demand for energy is lower than overall 
GDP growth, which increases by 126% over the
period, indicating some decoupling of energy
demand growth and economic growth.
• However, the resulting growth in energy
demand, in particular fossil fuels, will result in
increased imports of coal, natural gas and oil.
With corresponding increases in energy-related
CO2 rising by over 70%, external costs relating to
air pollution from fossil fuels increase by 21% to
an average of USD 68 billion in 2036.
Thailand is projected to have robust economic growth 
over the coming two decades, averaging around 3.9% 
per year over the period. The result is an increase in 
GDP of 126% by 2036. Over the period, demand for 
energy will increase by 78%, from 142 Mtoe in 2014 to 
253 Mtoe by 2036 (see Figure 20). Demand for fossil 
fuels will grow by 65%, with coal increasing 160%, 
natural gas 60%, and oil products over 30%. 
As Thailand’s economy grows, it will see GDP 
increases that are higher than increases in energy 
demand, indicating significant improvements in 
energy intensity of the country’s economy. Energy 
intensity will decrease by more than 20% from 134 
tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) per USD 1 million at 
purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2015 to 106 toe 
per USD 1 million PPP by 2036. This is shy of the 
AEDP 2015 goal of a 30% decrease over the period, 
but it is encouraging to see this improvement 
already occurring in the Reference Case, and is an 
indication that steps are being made to meet the 
goals for energy efficiency efforts in the TIEB. However, despite this, there are negatives. For 
instance, energy-related CO2 emissions will 
increase from 246 Mt in 2014 to 418 Mt in 2036. 
This will be driven largely by increases in emissions 
from the power generation and industrial sectors, 
with around half of the increase coming from 
increased use of coal, which brings with it not just 
higher CO2 emissions, but also increased levels 
of air pollution. Additionally, the use of oil will 
increase by over 30%, much of it in urban 
areas, where its effects on local air pollution are 
particularly acute. 
Therefore, external costs relating to air pollution 
from fossil fuels, such costs largely resulting from 
adverse effects on human health, will increase 
by on average 21% by 2036. Annual costs will 
increase from a range of USD 23-92 billion in 2015, 
to between USD 28 billion and USD 108 billion by 
2036 (with an average of USD 68 billion). Most of 
the increases will come from greater use of fossil 
fuels, in particular coal, in the industrial and power 
sectors. However, the largest source of external 
costs related to air pollution, representing around 
half of the costs, will remain the use of oil products 
in the transport sector due to high associated 
damage to human health in urban areas. 
The overall picture of development in the 
energy intensity, driven by a variety of factors that 
include shifts to modern energy, more efficient 
energy conversion, deployment of renewable 
energy, and improvements in energy efficiency 
in end uses. But at the same time, the increased 
use and dependence on fossil fuels drives 
increases in imports, higher levels of CO2
 and more 
air pollution.
Key source and technology developments
• The share of renewables increases in all sectors
in the Reference Case by 2036 except in the
buildings sector. Despite sustained growth in
renewable power, the renewable share of power
generation only increases marginally due to
similar increases in overall power demand. In
the end-use sectors, the use of fuels and other
direct uses of renewable energy for thermal and
transport applications increase largely based on
the use of bioenergy. Meanwhile, in the buildings
sector the decrease is led by the replacement
of both traditional bioenergy and modern
bioenergy with fossil fuels, largely LPG.
• Total system power capacity will increase by over
60%, with growth in coal, natural gas, bioenergy,
solar PV and wind. Natural gas is still expected
to be the main source of electricity generation,

Note: TPES = total primary energy supply. Total system power capacity will increase by 60% 
from 38 GW in 2015 to 62 GW in 2036. Capacity 
additions take place for coal, natural gas, solar PV, 
bioenergy and wind power (see Figure 21). Natural 
gas will remain the dominant source of electricity 
generation, accounting for around 60% of domestic 
supply according to the Reference Case in 2036.
In the transport sector, fuel demand growth is limited 
over the period, only increasing by 14%. Oil products 
remain the dominant fuel source, supplying around 
70% of the sector’s energy needs by 2036. However,

Note: End-use sector shares (industry, transport and buildings) show the share of renewable energy in the each sector’s energy demand 
excluding electricity, i.e. fuels and other direct uses of energy. 
from 6% in 2015 to 20% by 2036. Biodiesel from oil 
palm, and bioethanol from cassava and sugarcane 
molasses are expected to be the main sources of 
bioliquids, with around two-thirds being in the form 
of biodiesel. In addition, there is significant growth 
in compressed biogas from wastes and energy 
crops that supplies 6% of transport sector energy 
by 2036. The remainder is met largely with CNG 
and some electricity.
The industrial sector sees the highest share of renewable 
energy due to the significant use of biomass residues, 
In the Reference Case the share of renewables 
increases in all sectors except in the buildings sector 
(see Table 8). Overall the renewable share of TFEC 
increases by around two-thirds to 28%, but remains 
short of the 30% target for 2036. The renewable power 
share of domestically produced electricity (which 
excludes imports of large hydropower) increases only 
marginally to 18%, and despite significant growth in 
renewable power, its relative share does not increase 
much due to significant overall growth in power 
demand of just under 80%. However, if imported 
electricity is considered, and it is assumed to be 
mostly hydroelectric, then the share of renewable 
power increases to around 25%.
In the end-use sectors of buildings, industry 
and transport, increases in the renewable share 
of fuels and direct uses of energy for thermal 
applications and transport are largely driven by 
increased use of bioenergy. In the transport sector, 
significant increases in biodiesel and compressed 
biogas, and more modest increases in bioethanol, 
drive a surge in the share of renewable energy in 
transport fuel demand from 6% to 26%. This is the 
most pronounced increase in the renewable share of 
any sector, and driven entirely by the highly aggressive 
supply of bioliquids envisioned by AEDP 2015. 
Industry sees more than a tripling of bioenergy use 
largely in the form of solid biomass residues, which 
are likely to be the product of increases in residue 
supply from the production of liquid biofuels for the 
transport sector. The result is that the industrial sector 
has the higher renewable share of fuels and direct use 
of energy, with over 40% by 2036. The buildings sector 
sees a decline in its renewable share despite some 
increases in solar thermal for water heating in buildings. 
The significant decline in bioenergy use in buildings, 
and a shift to both LPG for cooking and electrification, 
result in a renewable energy share of just 4% in 2036.Coal Natural

4.2 REmap results 
This section outlines the REmap Case, which is 
an assessment of the accelerated potential of 
renewable energy in Thailand. The key findings 
that are detailed relate to the REmap Options, 
which are technologies and sources of renewable 
energy that have additional potential to be utilised 
or deployed on top of development expected in the 
Reference Case, which is broadly in line with AEDP 
2015. Therefore, this section’s main aim is to outline 
where the additional potential of renewable energy 
lies in Thailand beyond AEDP 2015, deployable by 
2036. 
This section also describes what is needed at the 
sector and technology levels to achieve this level of 
higher renewable energy deployment. The REmap 
Options explore the potential to increase renewables 
a mixed approach aimed at maximising renewable 
energy deployment – and address options in 
power, thermal uses, transport and cooking needs. 
For further information on the approach used to 
determine the REmap Options and sources, please 
see Annex: REmap methodology, assessment 
approach and data sources.
Drivers for renewable energy
The REmap Options identify areas across the 
entire energy system of Thailand where additional 
renewable energy potential lies. The criteria to 
select these options are not solely based on cost, 
but also on additional motivating factors that incline 
governments to support increased deployment of 
renewable energy technologies. These factors can 
include efforts to improve energy security, promotion 
of domestic industry, and efforts to improve local 
oil palm, and by surplus biomass residues that are 
currently not used. Biogas from biomass processing 
wastes also contributes to the increase in renewable 
energy share. The share of sector energy demand met 
by renewables, almost entirely bioenergy, will increase 
from a quarter to over 40%. This growth is tied in part 
to the increased supply of residues resulting from the 
increases in liquid biofuel production. The buildings 
sector sees the only decline in renewable share, the 
result of a decrease in the use of bioenergy and the 
significant growth in the use of oil products, largely 
LPG, for cooking. However, the REmap Options do show that 
renewables are in many cases the least-cost option 
for energy supply in Thailand. The cost case is even 
more appealing when considering benefits that 
arise from reduced air pollution and CO2
 emissions. 
As the costing section shows, the grouping 
of technologies identified in REmap not only 
reduces energy system costs as a whole – meaning 
lower overall energy costs for consumers – but 
also results in a similar decrease in external 
costs due to reduced air pollution and environmental 
damage. 
Additionally, the value of investment certainty with 
renewables is appealing. Fossil fuels have price 
volatility risk, particularly when an increasing share 
of those fossil fuels are imported, as is the case in 
Thailand. Valuing this risk is difficult, but should 
be considered when evaluating energy system 
investments. The renewables identified in this 
section either have no fuel price volatility (such as 
for solar, wind or hydro resources), or in the case 
of bioenergy are based largely on the local agroeconomy, which generally affords government 
more control over the market.
Subsequently energy security and diversification are 
a key driver in Thailand’s energy policies. The country 
currently imports around 60% of its energy. With 
declining domestic production of natural gas, and 
limited recoverable coal and oil, the country will see an 
increase in this share over the coming decades unless 
other indigenous energy resources can be scaled up 
to fill the gap (ACE, 2015a). Renewables provide 
a means to decrease dependency on imported 
fossil fuels, particularly because local renewable 
resources are underutilised and significant 
additional potential exists as detailed in 
Chapter 3. 
The following sections go into greater depth on what 
exploiting this additional potential entails, in which 
technologies and sectors. It will also quantify those 
technologies and sources in terms of their costs, benefits 
and investment needs. In all, the findings show that 
domestic industry can thrive if more renewable energy 
is deployed – from the local bio-economy utilising the 
entire value chain of locally produced bioenergy, to 
local expertise in solar thermal technologies, and the 
Summary of REmap findings
• In REmap, the share of renewables increases
across all sectors. The two largest sectors that see
increases are power and buildings, but increases
are also seen in transport and industry. Overall
renewable energy can provide 37% of Thailand’s
TFEC in 2036, surpassing by a wide margin the
government’s current target of 30%.
• The renewable power mix moves from one
dominated by hydropower and bioenergy, to
a much more diverse mix of technologies that
includes sizable generation from solar PV and wind. 
In REmap in 2036, 25% of domestic generation is
supplied from renewable sources, and if imported
hydropower is included, then almost 30% of
electricity is from renewable sources.
• Renewable use in the end-uses sectors is also
evident in the REmap findings, with high shares
in both industry and buildings. The use of all
renewables in TFEC increases from 19 Mtoe
in 2015, to 38 Mtoe in the Reference Case and
49 Mtoe in REmap by 2036 – an increase of 150%
over the period.
REmap identifies additional renewable energy potential 
across all sectors of Thailand. However, due to significant 
renewables growth already occurring in the industrial 
and transport sectors in the Reference Case – largely 
from the bioenergy-based targets set forth in AEDP 
2015 – most of the additional potential is identified in 
the power and buildings sectors. The power sector sees 
significant growth due to untapped potential particularly 
in solar PV, but also in wind, whereas the buildings sector 
sees growth from the utilisation of modern bioenergy 
and slowing the uptake of LPG. 
Overall renewable energy can provide 37% of Thailand’s 
TFEC, surpassing the government’s current target of 
30%. Across the sectors, the share of renewable energy 
will vary from a low of 27% in transport to as high as 
50% in industry. While the share of renewable energy in 
domestic power generation will be 25%, when including 
imported hydropower the share increases to almost 30%. 
The high share of renewables in industry and buildings 
are due, in part, to the table showing the share of 
renewable energy just for fuels and direct uses, therefore Table 9. Renewable energy shares in 2036: different cases compared

Total primary energy supply (modern) 13% 22% 28%
* Reference Case = Expected outcome of today’s plans and policies
** REmap = Achievable outcome with accelerated uptake of renewables
Several key findings are evident when looking at 
how these shares translate into energy supply 
as viewed in final energy terms (Figure 22). One 
is that renewable power generation sees its 
relative importance grow as a share of renewable 
energy consumed in the country. However, the 
renewable power mix moves from one dominated 
by hydropower and bioenergy to a much more 
diverse mix of technologies that includes strong 
growth in solar PV and moderate growth in wind 
power capacity. Renewable power consumed in the 
country quadruples over the period to 2036.
Another finding is the continued importance of 
renewable energy use in the end-uses sectors of 
buildings, industry and transport. In these sectors 
energy is needed in the form of fuels and direct use 
for thermal, cooking and transport applications. In 
final energy terms these applications are dominant, 
and generally make up 85-90% of renewable energy 
use over the period. Bioenergy remains the dominant 
source in the end-use applications due to its ability 
to be used as a source of heat and transport fuel. 
However, the REmap Options demonstrate limited 
additional bioenergy consumption due to the 
aggressive targets and growth already occurring in 
AEDP 2015, as reflected in the Reference Case. 
For instance, in transport, REmap assumes no 
additional use of biodiesel, bioethanol or compressed 
biogas for CNG vehicles. In industry, the use of 
biomass residues and biogas increases slightly, but 
only by around 3%, boosted by the growth in the 
biomass processing industry and by using a larger 
and more diverse pool of biomass residues from 
agriculture due largely to better collection methods. 
Traditional uses of bioenergy in the residential subsector are phased out between 2025 and 2030 in 
the Reference Case. However, REmap assumes that 
a share of this traditional use of bioenergy can be 
combusted efficiently and sustainably, with the use 
of modern cookstoves and biogas digesters, resulting 
in an increase in modern bioenergy in the residential 
sector by reversing the uptake of LPG instead.
Solar thermal is also an important source of renewable 
energy in the end-use sectors. The technology can 
provide domestic hot water in the residential sector, 
but also in sub-sectors such as tourism. In industry, 
Thailand has a history of solar thermal systems 
providing low-temperature heat and pre-heating 
services. The Reference Case does see an increase 
in both solar thermal systems in the buildings and 
industrial sectors, providing around 2% of heating 
demand by 2036 (excluding electricity). In REmap 
significant additional potential has been identified, 
raising the share of heating demand met by solar 
thermal across the two sectors to just over 10%.
In total, the amount of renewable energy used 
in Thailand will increase from 19 Mtoe in 2015 to 
38 Mtoe in the Reference Case, and increase further 
to 49 Mtoe in REmap – a 150% increase over the 
2015 level. This would lead to an increase in the 
share of modern renewables in TFEC from 13% in 
2015 to 37% in REmap.1% 2% 1% 61% 1% 6% 4% 2% 49%

• Electricity demand will grow by almost 90%
between 2015 and 2036 to over 325 TWh annually. 
Renewable power generation grows significantly
in both the Reference Case and REmap; however,
due to significant overall growth in electricity
demand, the increase in renewable energy share
is modest. The overall renewable energy share
in generation from domestic power producers
will reach 25% in REmap in 2036, up from 18% in
the Reference Case, and 13% in 2015. If imported
hydro is also considered, the share would be 4-5
percentage points higher.
• Power system capacity will increase from
39 GW in 2015 to 62 GW in the Reference Case,
and beyond that to 74 GW in REmap. Natural gas
will remain the largest power capacity source;
however, in REmap the second-largest is solar
PV, followed by coal and then wind.
The power sector in Thailand will see important and 
substantive shifts over the next two decades. In 
an attempt to diversify supply in view of declining 
natural gas production, the power system sees the 
need to install more coal- and renewables-based 
power generation. However, the future of coal is 
uncertain, and while additions are expected, REmap 
shows that their additions could be slowed and 
instead increased power demand met with higher 
deployment of renewable power technologies such 
as solar PV and wind.
Electricity demand will grow between 2015 and 2036 
by almost 90% to over 325 TWh per year. Renewable 
power generation grows significantly in both 
the Reference Case and REmap; however, due to 
significant overall growth in electricity demand, the 
increase in the renewable energy share is modest. As 
can be seen in Figure 23, the overall renewable energy 
share in power generation from domestic generation 
will reach 25% in REmap in 2036, up from 18% in the 
Reference Case and 13% in 2015. Domestic power 
system capacity will increase from 39 GW in 2015 to 
62 GW in the Reference Case, and beyond that to 
74 GW in REmap. The increase in REmap is due to 
both increased electrification in end-uses, such as 
from EVs, but also the lower capacity factor of solar 
and wind necessitating more installed capacity.
Imported electricity will also grow, mainly from 
hydropower sources from regions north of Thailand. 
This is already reflected in the Reference Case as AEDP 
2015 targets an increase in imported hydropower 
from 7% to over 10% of electricity demand. 
The renewable power additions occurring between 
2015 and 2036 differ between the Reference Case 
and the REmap Options (see Figure 23). Roughly 
half of renewable power generation additions in the 
Reference Case are from bioenergy sources, largely 
industrial co-generation linked to high planned 
utilisation of biofuel residues, with the remainder 
split between wind and solar PV. Total renewable 
power generation will increase by 36 TWh over the 
period – an increase of around 150%.Other

Figure 23. Renewable share in the power sector and generation additions, 2015-2036
The REmap Options see power generation additions 
that differ from the Reference Case. The largest new 
source is solar PV, followed by wind. Even so, in 
REmap natural gas remains the largest generation 
source, with half of the power system capacity 
and around two-thirds of generation. However, 
because of the REmap Options, by 2036 solar PV 
becomes the second-largest renewable power 
source (behind bioenergy) and fourth overall. This 
significant growth in solar PV is largely the result 
of rapidly improving market conditions for solar PV, 
and the ability for new plants to be built quickly 
and in a more distributed manner than traditional 
central station power plants.
It is also important to note the growing importance 
of wind power, which sees an increase from around 
3 GW in the Reference Case to 6 GW in REmap 
in 2036. Declining wind turbine costs are a driver, 
and even though 6 GW is significant growth over the 
0.4 GW in operation as of 2015, recent studies show 
wind potential as high as 14 GW in areas with favourable 
wind speeds (6 m/s). Wind generation will increase 
in REmap to provide just over 4% of gross electricity 
generation – roughly half of the 8% supplied by 
solar PV. In total, these two variable sources of electricity 
will provide 12% of Thailand’s gross inland supply.
Thermal power generation from coal and bioenergy 
have roughly similar capacities in REmap in 2036 
(see Figure 24). Coal-fired capacity declines in 
REmap from the Reference Case; however this 
is modest, and its decline could be greater if the 
government decides to replace new coal plants 
with either natural gas-fired or renewables capacity. 
Some in the country have emphasised the need for 
coal as a means of energy diversification and to 
avoid overreliance of natural gas, which is seeing 
declining domestic supply. However, as REmap 
shows, the better option would be to consider 
expanding renewables further to offset increases in 
coal (which will largely need to be imported).Power capacity (GW)

Bioenergy-based generation will remain the largest 
domestic source of renewable electricity generation. 
This is due entirely to developments occurring in the 
Reference Case according to AEDP 2015. The use 
of bioenergy-based electricity generation is widely 
developed in Thailand and is consolidated in many 
industries. Most of the power capacity is installed 
in biomass-based industries that have easy access 
to reliable sources of residual biomass produced as 
part of their operations. The main industries are the 
sugarcane industry, where bagasse is widely used in 
co-generation systems, the palm oil industry, which 
uses oil palm residues in power and heat generation, 
and the cassava industry, where both solid and 
liquid wastes are used for biogas production and 
power generation. A significant part of the electricity 
generated in those plants is, in fact, used by the 
industry itself, in self-generation arrangements, and 
a smaller share is exported to the electricity grid. 
Also, significant amounts of rice straw and husks are 
used in independent power plants, as well as biomass 
residues from rubber trees and maize (straw and 
cobs). In addition to solid biomass residues, biogas 
produced from biomass wastes and wastewater is 
widely used for electricity generation in Thailand 
too. The country has an impressive amount of biogas 
power plants in different sectors of the economy, 
VRE integration in Thailand’s power system 
If all the REmap Options were deployed, the share of 
VRE (solar PV and wind) in Thailand’s power system 
would stand at 31% of system capacity, and 12% of 
annual generation in 2036. REmap does not analyse 
what types of flexibility measures might be needed 
to accommodate this amount of variable production 
capacity. However, IRENA has significant project 
data and analysis on the topic from other countries, 
regions and for general power system contexts. This 
section details some of the key findings from those 
studies and other literature relevant to Thailand. It 
provides a qualitative view and applies them to the 
Thai energy context. However, further study and 
analysis needs to take place to provide a better 
understanding of how electricity end users, local 
grid and transmission operators, and government 
regulators can start to plan for a power system with 
increasing shares of VRE power technologies. 
Renewable energy resources such as solar and wind 
are typically operated differently from conventional 
power generation plants due to their variability. 
Depending on the share of VRE and the power 
system features, these differences may prompt 
changes in the way the systems are planned and in forecasting its production with high accuracy can 
pose new challenges for the planning and operation 
of the power system. If high shares of VRE are to 
be integrated, the system must be able to deal with 
additional uncertainty and variability in its operation. 
In the case of Thailand, the REmap Options result 
in a VRE share of only 12% of annual domestic 
electricity production. While this is not a high 
share, and many power systems around the world 
today integrate a similar share without issue, it is 
important to understand how power systems move 
to increasing proportions of VRE and what efforts 
may be needed. While it is likely that Thailand 
will not require additional flexibility measures to 
integrate the VRE detailed in this study, as the 
country moves beyond the envisaged share of VRE 
in the post-2036 timeframe, a view on the longerterm planning for the country’s power system is 
needed and that planning should begin today.
A recently published IRENA report, Planning for 
the Renewable Future: Long-Term Modelling and 
Tools to Expand Variable Renewable Power in 
Emerging Economies, part of AVRIL (“Addressing 
Variable Renewable Energy in Long-Term Energy 
Planning”), explains the best practices in long-term 
planning and modelling for the management of 
high shares of VRE (IRENA, 2017c). Requirements 
for VRE generators to support the stable operation 
of the system must be identified and established. 
One way is through updates to the existing grid 
codes. IRENA’s recent report Scaling Up Variable 
Renewable Power: The Role of Grid Codes 
(IRENA, 2016b) explains various aspects of grid 
connection code development with country 
illustrations that might serve as a reference for 
Thailand’s future grid code development in the 
context of increasing shares of VRE. 
Additional efforts include strengthening and expanding 
transmission infrastructure. As part of EGAT’s network 
development plan, a 500 kV transmission line 
equivalent to 13% of total grid capacity will be further 
extended by 2019 to facilitate the country’s growing 
renewables potential and to ensure electricity security 
with adequate flexibility of generating fleet (IEA, 2016).
Another method of increasing grid flexibility is 
Effective Deployment (IRENA, 2013), details how 
effective deployment of smart grids can play a 
crucial role in enabling higher shares of renewable 
power, facilitating its smooth integration. They also 
support the decentralised production of power 
and enable the creation of new business models 
through enhanced information flows. Additionally, 
consumer engagement and improved system control 
provide flexibility on the demand side. Another 
IRENA report, Smart Grids and Renewables: A CostBenefit Analysis Guide for Developing Countries 
(IRENA, 2015b) provides insight into cost-benefit 
analysis of smart grid systems in developing countries, 
which could be potentially applicable to Thailand. 
Nevertheless, Thailand has already initiated various 
activities to deploy smart grids, one good example 
being the Smart Grid Roadmap announced by 
PEA. The objective of this roadmap is to apply 
advanced and new technologies to optimise power 
system operation in the country. PEA recently 
announced its latest investment of THB 2 billion 
(USD 58 million) in smart grid deployment in five Thai 
cities (Pattaya, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Nakhon Ratchasima 
and Hat Yai) (Metering, 2017). The first smart grid 
pilot project by PEA will be implemented in Pattaya 
due to the high-energy consumption rate in the city 
(Metering, 2015). As part of this project, PEA aims to 
install 120 000 smart meters in residential areas and 
construct a data centre for processing the energy 
data, which will essentially aid PEA to understand 
consumer behaviour and to utilise this data to improve 
the energy management activities (IEA, 2016). 
Other efforts include the recent approval of a 
smart grid national plan by NEPC, focusing on 
implementation of three to five smart grid pilot 
test projects (the tentative locations include Muang 
district and Mae Sariang in Mae Hong Son province, 
Bangkok, Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan) with 
an estimated total investment of THB 5 billion 
(USD 145 million) over the next five years. 
Implementation will be done by state-owned 
power utilities such as EGAT, PEA and MEA 
(The Nation, 2016). The aim of these pilot projects is to 
reduce the country’s peak power demand by a total of 
350 MW (The Nation, 2016).
Apart from this, Thailand has pursued projects for a Phi Suea housing development and shows a 
potential route for the future of renewable energy 
storage in the country (The Green Optimistic, 
2015). Furthermore, in 2016, Southeast Asia’s first 
megawatt-scale renewable hydrogen-based energy 
storage project was awarded by EGAT. This energyneutral building will convert surplus electricity from 
wind generation – from the Lam Takhong Wind 
Turbine Generation Project – to hydrogen during 
off-peak hours. During peak hours the hydrogen fuel 
cells will be able to generate sufficient electricity for 
the centre (Global News Wire, 2016).
The establishment of pricing related to smart grids 
is an important aspect that is yet to be considered 
in the country (GIZ, 2013). Additionally, smart grid 
implementation involves various challenges, which 
include: low electricity tariffs with high capital costs 
and concerns on payback period; how to do both the 
implementation of renewable energy programmes 
in parallel to smart grid deployment; and adequate 
skills development to operate and maintain the 
smart grid systems in future (GIZ, 2013). 
IRENA’s publication on adapting market design 
to high shares of VRE (IRENA, 2017a) highlights 
that distribution companies will play a key role 
in the deployment and operation of grid-related 
infrastructure, such as public EV charging stations 
or distributed storage. Thailand aims to bring 
in nearly 1.2 million EVs over next two decades 
(Insideevs, 2016) and REmap identifies greater 
potential, with almost 1.5 million on the roads by 
2036. In addition to the MoE promoting the 150 
charging station installations nationwide, automobile 
companies plan to open charging stations to 
promote the current range of plug-in hybrid vehicles 
(Nationmultimedia, 2017). The vehicle-to-grid 
scheme allows EVs to participate in grid ancillary 
services such as frequency regulation, load shifting, 
demand response, or energy management support 
in the home (IRENA, 2017b)
Finally, the potential of renewables to revolutionise 
off-grid, mini-grid and island systems is now 
evident. Hundreds of Thai islands possess huge 
potential for hybrid energy system deployment. 
Small islands provide a valuable opportunity for 
testing new technologies and operational modes for 
(IRENA and IEA-ETSAP, 2015). In principle, the 
electricity demand of such islands with a peak load of 
a few hundred kilowatts could be effectively met by 
variable renewables, such as wind and PV power and 
with adequate energy storage to balance supply and 
demand (IRENA, 2012). Generally, islands are powered 
by diesel generation, which is often oversized to meet 
peak demand and not meant to operate below 30% 
of capacity, forming an expensive generation option 
with high emissions (IRENA, 2015a). In such cases, 
battery storage seems to be an economic and viable 
option. Battery storage technology may be utilised 
to aid renewable energy integration, reduce reliance 
on diesel and gas generation, and lower the costs of 
electricity (IRENA, 2015a). A case study performed 
for an isolated island in Thailand reveals that a hybrid 
PV/diesel energy system can decrease the cost of 
electricity from USD 0.429/kWh to USD 0.374/kWh 
when compared to the existing diesel-based system, 
with PV contributing to 41% of the total output 
(Peerapong and Limmeechokchai, 2017). 
Planning for a future with a higher share of VRE needs 
to start today. Resources such as those listed in this 
section are a starting point for policy makers to better 
understand the broad scope of technology solutions, 
regulations and market approaches that address 
the issue. However, further study and analysis need 
to take place to provide a better understanding of 
how electricity end users, local grid and transmission 
operators, and government regulators can start to 
plan for a power system with increasing proportions 
of variable renewable power technologies.
Buildings sector
• The buildings sector sees growth in final energy
demand of 75% in the period 2015-36 in the
Reference Case. Almost all of this increase is
derived from two sources: oil products, mainly
LPG; and electricity. Modern bioenergy decreases 
in the Reference Case, and as a result the share of 
modern renewables decreases from 20% to 11%.
• The REmap Options reverse the decline and
result in almost a tripling of the renewable energy 
share of final energy to 32%. The main drivers are
the use of modern bioenergy, including biogas
and electricity for cooking thereby slowing theBuildings sector energy demand in Thailand 
comprises a mix of electricity for appliances and 
cooling, limited thermal needs for water heating, and 
the use of fuels for cooking. The sector sees growth 
in energy demand of 75% from 2015 to 2036 in the 
Reference Case. The vast majority of this growth 
comes from either electricity, used in appliances 
or cooling, and oil products (mostly LPG) used for 
cooking. Also in the Reference Case, the amount of 
bioenergy consumed in the sector is reduced, mostly 
replaced with LPG. The result of these developments 
is a decrease in share of renewables in the Reference 
Case as can be seen in Figure 25. Traditional uses of 
bioenergy are also phased out during the period.
Solar thermal is a key technology that has been in 
use in limited forms for water heating in Thailand, 
but has significant additional potential. REmap sees 
the addition of around 12 gigawatts thermal (GWth) 
of systems, or around 0.25 million medium-sized 
systems. These are installed in buildings that have 
larger heating demand, such as hotels, commercial 
buildings and apartment complexes. 
Another key technology in the buildings sector 
is bioenergy. The buildings sector accounts for 
The REmap Options reverse the decline and 
result in a tripling of the renewable energy share. 
The main source is bioenergy for modern uses 
such as for cooking with biogas instead of LPG, 
electricity used for cooking, and increased use 
of solar thermal for applications such as hot 
water, which can include uses in the tourism and 
commercial sub-sectors. Despite these increases in 
renewable energy, the use of LPG still almost 
quadruples over the period; however, 
renewables do slow LPG’s rise considerably 
by reducing it from a sixfold increase. 
Consequently, the sector’s energy mix would be 
diversified compared to what it would otherwise be.

cooking prevail in the residential sector. Estimates 
for supply of bioenergy are unreliable, with a range 
of 140-440 PJ. 
The alternatives to traditional biomass in cooking are 
many. LPG is a modern fuel that causes significantly 
less indoor air pollution and is thus preferred to the 
use of traditional bioenergy, especially if biomass is 
collected unsustainably and is used in rudimentary 
cookstoves. But another good option, especially in 
rural areas, is to switch to modern cookstoves using traditional cooking methods, reducing cooking 
times and indoor air pollution. Ethanol gels have 
gained attention in the recent years with promising 
results in various African and Asian countries. 
Biogas for cooking and other residential uses 
is also promoted in several countries and is an 
alternative that requires sustained attention and 
effort for long-term, durable effectiveness. In 
general, long-term systems tend to be abandoned 
due to lack of training, maintenance and technical 
support. The use of household or community-based 
biodigesters for biogas production also requires a 
reliable source of substrate, which is not always 
the case in many households and communities. 
Therefore, deployment of biogas at the household 
or community level must be followed by long-term 
technical support and maintenance to ensure that 
the biodigesters will operate for many years and 
deliver the biogas yields that are consistent with 
the household or community demands.
Electric cooking is another option. It is a clear 
trend in developed countries but uptake varies 
widely. The challenge for widespread deployment 
in developing countries is the need for a grid 
connection. Older electric coil technologies with 
4 rings typically have 1.5 kW capacity and may require 
0.5-1.5 kW during operation. New induction cooking 
technologies have dropped significantly in price in 
the last few years, and their efficiency is higher and 
electricity demand lower. Whereas electric coils need 
2.0 kW to deliver 1.1 kW of heat (55% efficiency), 
natural gas a similar 50% efficiency, and LPG around 
40% efficiency, induction efficiency is closer to 90%. 
Therefore, modern electric cooking technologies can 
be a means of reducing the use of LPG or other fuels 
and saving consumers money. Therefore, REmap 
assumes that the uptake of electric cookstoves in urban 
and suburban areas can be increased significantly to 
around 2 million units by 2036.
One of the largest sources of electricity demand 
in the buildings sector is for cooling. While almost 
the entirety of this increase in cooling demand 
will be met by traditional air conditioners, which 
are seeing increases in their efficiency, they still 
require significant amounts of electricity and 
solutions do exist to meet cooling demand through 
developments, large commercial users and hotels, 
where a centralised, high-efficiency cooling unit 
provides either chilled water or cooled air to 
numerous blocks or buildings. A recent IRENA 
study outlined in more detail the opportunity for 
this technology (IRENA, 2017d). Technologies such 
as cold storage can be considered in certain cases. 
During the night or at times when electricity is 
plentiful (from variable renewable power generation 
such as solar and wind) ice is produced, stored, and 
then used when cooling is needed and electricity is 
in short supply or costly. 
Industrial sector
• The industrial sector sees the largest growth in
energy demand of any sector, with an increase
of around 145% occurring between 2015 and
2036. In the Reference Case around half of this
growth is met by coal and natural gas, 40% with
bioenergy and the remainder with electricity.
• Given the large growth in bioenergy in the
Reference Case, the REmap Options assume little 
additional bioenergy use. The main technology in 
the REmap Options is solar thermal used for lowtemperature industrial uses. Overall the result is
a small increase in the renewable share. However, 
the sector already has the highest share of
renewables due to the significant bioenergy use
occurring in the Reference Case.
The industrial sector sees the largest growth in 
energy demand of any sector, with an increase 
of over 145% occurring by 2036. Fossil fuels 
meet around half of this growth, with bioenergy 
supplying 40% and electricity around 10%. The 
increase in sector energy demand is the result of 
a general uptick in industrial activity resulting from 
a rapidly growing and industrialising economy. The 
main driver for such aggressive growth in bioenergy 
in the Reference Case is the AEDP 2015 plans to 
dramatically increase liquid biofuel production for 
transport, which as an ancillary produces significant 
bioenergy residues which are used for process heat 
and co-generation. 
Given the significant growth in bioenergy in 
the Reference Case, as can be seen in Figure 26, renewable supply in industry is solar thermal, 
specifically low-temperature technologies used 
mainly in food processing for pre-heating and 
AEDP 2015 aims to increase significantly the use 
of biomass in process heat applications in industry. 
The use of biomass for heat applications in Thai 
industry is most predominant in biomass-based 
industries such as sugarcane, cassava and palm oil. 
As explained before, that use goes together with 
the production of electricity in co-generation plants 
that serve the energy needs of those industries, 
which usually produce enough biomass residues 
to supply their own energy needs and surpluses 
that could be used off site. In fact, co-generation in 
biomass-based industries should be a priority in the 
development of the AEDP. 
Despite most of the existing potential having 
potentially already been exploited and considering 
that future expansion will come from on-site cogeneration plants, mechanisms should be put in 
place to ensure that biomass resources are used at 
the highest levels of efficiency. The production of 
heat and power is not the core business of biomassbased industries and they usually do not have 
drying. However, these additions are limited to 
an increase of only around 3 Mtoe, compared to 
bioenergy with an increase of 17 Mtoe.

they would produce just enough heat and power 
to meet their own needs. It is thus essential that 
incentives be provided to ensure that resources are 
used to their fullest potential. Knowledge sharing 
on best practices and the establishment of sectoral 
performance benchmarks on energy intensity and 
waste utilisation would highly benefit the relevant 
sectors and could serve as a driving force to foster 
change. Incentive mechanisms could be devised in a 
way that takes into account efficiency and rewards 
those with the highest levels.
Transport sector
• The transport sector sees the lowest level of
demand growth of any sector, increasing only
14% between 2015 and 2036. Fossil fuels, mostly
oil products, will continue to play a major role,
providing around 75% of sector energy. However,
the Reference Case sees significant growth in
liquid biofuels and compressed biogas, with
these fuels providing around one-quarter of• REmap assumes no additional biofuels use due
to the strong growth already occurring in the
Reference Case. Instead, REmap focuses on
identifying the potential of EVs in various modes,
and as a result the demand for electricity in the
sector triples. The number of passenger EVs on
the road by 2036 would total 1.5 million.
The transport sector is traditionally the most 
challenging sector in which to increase renewable 
energy utilisation. The ubiquitous use of oil products, 
combined with the need for high energy density, 
means that only biofuels have in the past competed 
with oil products. Thailand has a history of producing 
biofuels, with blending mandates that require both 
bioethanol and biodiesel; however, the targets have 
in years past not been met. In 2015, around 6% of the 
sector’s fuel demand was met with liquid biofuel.
Over the coming decades, the sector sees the 
lowest growth in demand of any sector, but an 
increase is still expected on the order of 14% 
by 2036. The slow increase is due to higher efficiency 
of the automobile stock, despite an uptick in car 
ownership. However, in the Reference Case the fuel 
mix does start to shift. Due to the aggressive liquid 
and gaseous biofuel targets of AEDP 2015, the share 
of renewable fuels will increase to one-quarter 
of transport energy demand. Liquid biofuels will 
supply 6.5 Mtoe and compressed biogas 2 Mtoe.

Biofuels
The largest increase in renewable energy by far 
will be from the use of biofuels (mostly biodiesel, 
bioethanol and compressed biogas), which will 
increase from around 6% of sector energy to 26% in 
the Reference Case by 2036. Given this large increase 
already taking place in the Reference Case, REmap 
assumes no additional bioenergy use in transport. 
In fact, the use of biofuels in transport is a very 
many years and AEDP 2015 intends to significantly 
increase the use of these two fuels by 2036, from 
3.5 million litres (L) per day currently to 11.3 million L per 
day in the case of bioethanol and from 3.4 million L 
per day to 14 million L per day in the case of biodiesel. 
AEDP 2015 also emphasises the use of biogas in 
transport, in the form of compressed biogas. Currently 
the use of compressed biogas in transport is relatively 
small, but in the long run the plan is to place it on a par 
with bioethanol on an energy basis. 4.69 million L per day, and 12 biodiesel refineries 
with a total nominal installed capacity of 
6.52 million L per day. Despite a short-term surplus 
of capacity, significant increases in the refining 
capacity will be required to sustain the intended 
AEDP targets. In the period between 2011 and 2015, 
the installed nameplate capacity of bioethanol 
production increased by 50%, from 2.7 million L 
per day to 4 million L per day. That is substantial 
growth that will need to be maintained to achieve 
AEDP 2015 targets. In the case of biodiesel, recent 
trends in installed capacity show a constant capacity 
of 6 million L per day. That trend must be challenged 
and investment increase. Another challenge to 
accomplish the targets is on the feedstock supply 
side. Ensuring sustainable primary biomass supply 
to produce bioethanol, biodiesel and biogas can 
be challenging and should be carefully planned, as 
discussed in the previous chapter. 
The development of compressed biogas will also 
require significant expansion and upgrading of 
existing biogas production capacity. In addition to 
anaerobic digesters, the production of compressed 
biogas requires upgrading plants that turn 
biogas into compressed biogas, which entails the 
development of adequate technology suppliers and 
technologies for long-term operation. A distribution 
network to ensure that the fuel reaches its end-use 
markets is also essential, taking in consideration 
the geographic distribution of compressed biogas 
production and existing gas pipelines. Quality 
standards for blending compressed biogas with 
natural gas should also be developed from the early 
stages of the programme. 
As previously explained, although the use of 
gaseous fuels (natural gas and LPG) in transport 
is not uncommon in Thailand, the development of 
a wider compressed biogas market may be more 
challenging. The conversion of vehicles to use 
gaseous fuels, such as compressed biogas, is only 
widely adopted if there is confidence that the fuel 
will be available in a sustained manner over large 
areas of the country. The adoption of compressed 
biogas in captive fleets, such as taxis, buses and 
transport companies, is often preferred so that fuel 
demand and refuelling locations can be planned 
under the control of the fleet operator.
Electric mobility
Whereas in the Reference Case AEDP sees strong 
growth in biofuels, REmap instead emphasises 
electric mobility. EVs are an emerging technology 
that provides an important link with the power system 
when coupled with variable renewables such as solar 
PV or wind. EVs are also a means to drive down levels 
of air pollution in urban areas. The Reference Case 
sees 470 000 EVs (including battery electric vehicles 
[BEVs] and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles [PHEVs]) 
on the road by 2036. The Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP) 
of Thailand targets as many as 1 200 000. REmap 
increases the total of EVs to 1 490 000 by 2036, 
representing 10% of the car stock, providing 15 GWh 
of storage capacity. 
It is not just electric cars that hit the roads – electric 
two - and three-wheelers are also deployed, particularity 
in urban areas and cities, with REmap seeing over 
1 000 000 on the road in the Reference Case and 
3 500 000 million in REmap. Additionally, larger 
EVs will also see adoption. Electric buses are 
emerging as a key public transport solution that has 
uses in certain transport lines with certain ranges, or 
where overhead charging, intermittent charging or 
end-point charging is possible. And light freight 
vehicles for services such as package delivery or fleet 
uses will also see the adoption of forms of electric 
mobility. 4.3 Costs and benefits of 
renewable energy
The previous sections have provided an overview 
of the potential of accelerated renewable energy 
uptake and discussed the technologies across 
all energy sectors. This section outlines the 
associated costs and benefits of higher renewables 
deployment, and discusses the level of investment 
that would be required. 
REmap assesses costs and benefits using a variety 
of indicators,40 including:
• A substitution approach, detailing if there is an
incremental cost or saving from a renewable
energy technology compared to a substituted
conventional technology. This view looks only
at the associated cost of energy service, i.e. the
relative cost of providing the same amount of
energy from a renewable technology versus a
conventional one. The sum of these costs shows
whether there is an incremental energy system
cost or saving.
• An externality assessment that quantifies
reductions in external costs due to lower levels
of air pollution and CO2 emissions.
• An assessment of the level of investment needed 
to deploy all the renewable energy capacity
outlined in the Reference Case and the REmap
Options. Any complementary infrastructure is
not part of the assessment.
Costs and savings
• The REmap Options result in both a reduction
in energy system costs of around USD 1.2 billion
annually by 2036, equivalent to USD -9.2 per
megawatt hour (MWh), and a similar reduction in
external costs in the range of USD 1.2-7.9 billion
annually from reduced externalities. Therefore,
the package of renewable technologies is both
cheaper than the fossil alternatives, and also
results in very significant reductions in external
costs.
• The power and buildings sectors see the most
cost-competitive renewable technology options,
with key technologies including solar PV, solar
thermal and biogas.
Substitution cost is one metric that compares 
the relative attractiveness of renewable energy 
technologies against conventional options. These 
conventional variants are technologies that exist in 
the Reference Case and are replaced by renewable 
technologies with the REmap Options. Substitution 
cost therefore measures the relative cost or saving of 
this substitution, i.e. how the energy service cost would 
change if a renewable technology were deployed 
instead of a conventional one. It can be shown at the 
individual technology level using technology cost 
supply curves as seen in Figure 28, or through other 
metrics such as marginal cost of CO2
 mitigation. 
A variety of factors can affect the substitution 
cost, including the capital cost of technologies, 
their performance characteristics, the assumed 
discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) 
and fuel costs. The cost is also driven by the type 
of conventional technology substituted, e.g. if 
coal is substituted, which has low fuel costs, the 
substitution cost will likely be higher than if oil, 
with high fuel costs, is substituted. The facilities 
that are substituted depend on factors that range 
from their type of energy technology and the sector 
in which they operate, to the age of the capital 
stock and planned new additions of technology. 
Because of rapid energy demand growth, this 
assessment only considers substitution of either 
a) capital stock reaching the end of its operation
lifetime and needing replacement, or b) new capital
stock required to be installed over the analysis
period. Therefore, no additional costs are assumed
to account for forced early retirement.
In addition, a further important driver for costs is 
whether the more cost-competitive renewables 
have already been deployed in the Reference Case, 
i.e. the low-hanging fruit, leaving costlier choices 
for the REmap Options.

Figure 28. Cost-supply curve for REmap options — government perspective
The result of this substitution approach is shown in 
Figure 28. The figure is a cost-supply curve showing 
along the y-axis the average substitution cost of the 
technology for a given renewable technology (the 
REmap Option) compared to a conventional variant. 
The cost is shown in USD per MWh of final energy. 
Along the x-axis is the share of renewable energy 
in TFEC. Therefore, the width of the bar directly 
corresponds to how much energy from that source 
is consumed in final energy. The larger the bar, the 
more energy is consumed, and therefore the higher 
the amount of capacity that is required. 
The curve shows that Thailand increases its 
renewable energy share from 17% in 2015, to 28% 
in the Reference Case by 2036, and the REmap 
Options add an additional 9 percentage points to 
arrive at 37% renewable energy share of total final 
energy by 2036. For the purpose of presentation, 
the Reference Case growth has been scaled to better 
show the REmap Options. The average substitution 
cost of the grouping of renewable technologies, i.e. 
if the package of renewable technologies identified 
in REmap were deployed, the cost per MWh of final 
energy across Thailand’s energy system would be 
USD 9.2 per MWh lower. However, this effect is 
across the entirety of Thailand’s energy market. If 
only the power technology options are considered, 
they have an average substitution cost of 
USD -3.7 per MWh. This means that the effect would 
be a lower overall wholesale power generation price 
on the order of around half a cent per kWh.
If specific technologies are examined, one sees how 
the cost-competitiveness of the REmap Options 
differs. The most affordable technologies include 
solar thermal systems in the buildings sector, which 
is a simple and affordable technology that competes 
well against any alternative, but in particular electric 
hot water systems. The other significant source 
of additional cost-effective renewable potential 
in buildings is biogas. The Reference Case sees 
very significant growth in the use of LPG, mostly 
for cooking. Biogas from anaerobic digestion is an use of electric cookstoves, in particular modern 
and efficient induction stoves, are a cost-effective 
means of reducing LPG use in the buildings sector. 
The end-use sectors also show significant additional 
potential for solar thermal heat used in industry 
for low-temperature applications. However, due to 
the higher temperature demands of industrial heat 
applications, combined with the limited production 
profile of these solar thermal systems, even meeting 
low-temperature needs (<150°C) sees their cost 
being higher than the conventional variants, albeit 
only marginally at just USD 3.3 per MWh.
Power sector technologies offer competitive 
options. Solar PV in large commercial and utilityscale applications is the cheapest form of electricity 
on offer in Thailand, and results in a substitution 
cost of USD -14.8 per MWh. Wind energy offers 
significant additional potential as well, but at a 
higher substitution cost of USD 21.6 per MWh. 
There is also slight additional potential of small 
hydropower, but its contribution is minor.
Transport sector technologies show a mixed 
picture. Due to significant growth in liquid biofuels 
in the Reference Case, no additional potential for 
biofuels is considered under REmap. EVs do not 
show significant potential in the curve; however, 
this is not because their deployment is limited (as 
detailed in an earlier section, they have significant 
potential), but rather as the result of what is 
displayed in the curve. For one, EVs are highly 
efficient and are on average three to four times 
more efficient than internal combustion engines, 
meaning it takes one-quarter the amount of energy 
to deliver the same amount of passenger or freight 
service. Additionally, the curve only shows the 
share of renewable electricity consumed by those 
vehicles, i.e. around one-quarter of their electricity 
demand. Therefore, if all electricity consumed by 
EVs were shown, then their contribution would 
be four times larger. For these reasons, this figure 
is not the best means of displaying the relative 
importance of EVs, or electric technologies in 
general. Furthermore, as demand technologies they 
do not produce energy, but they are shown in the 
curve because of their importance in increasing the 
renewable share of energy in transport (by shifting 
energy consumption to the power sector where 
Figure 2941 shows how energy system costs and 
external costs are affected by the REmap Options. 
When the substitution costs for the grouping 
of REmap Options are summed, they result in a 
perspective on how those renewable technologies 
affect energy system costs. The result is a reduction 
in energy system costs of USD 1.2 billion annually 
by 2036. These system costs do not consider 
reduced externalities, which result from lower levels 
of air pollution and CO2
. 
Lower levels of air pollution improve the conditions 
for human health and the local environment. Air 
pollution is a cause of ill health, particularly in cities, 
but it also damages crops. CO2 is a greenhouse gas, 
which is the main contributor to global warming, 
and numerous studies have examined its effect 
and determined a range for the social cost of 
carbon. REmap assesses both outdoor and indoor 
air pollution using a methodology developed 
specifically for the purpose (IRENA, 2016c). CO2
 is 
assessed using a social cost of carbon ranging from 
USD 17 to USD 80 per tonne of CO2. 
The figure also shows how the REmap Options 
affect sector costs. Two sectors, transport and 
industry, have incremental energy system cost 
effects resulting from deployment of the REmap 
Options. This means the grouping of technologies 
identified in REmap for those sectors are more 
expensive on an energy service basis than the 
conventional alternatives. 
However, in both transport and industry there 
are savings related to reduced adverse effects on 
health that are sizable and, in the case of industry, 
the health savings are five times larger than the 
incremental cost of energy for the sector. What is 
not quantified is the cost and benefit of reducing 
imports of oil and its products, such as diesel and 
petrol, and the larger macroeconomic benefits to 
jobs and GDP that would result from producing 
biofuels or electricity locally for transport uses. 
41 Please note that Figure 29 considers benefits resulting from the deployment 
of renewables that reduce external costs due to fewer adverse effects on 
human health from lower levels of air pollution and reduced environmental 
and social damage resulting from lower levels of CO2
. However, benefits 
from renewables can also include positive macroeconomic effects that USD bln. per year in 2036

Figure 29. Costs and benefits of REmap options
The buildings and power sectors have negative 
energy system costs, resulting in savings to the cost 
of energy in those sectors for consumers. While the 
savings in the power sector are marginal (mentioned 
previously at around half a cent per kWh), those in 
buildings are significant, due in large part to the use 
of biogas for cooking and solar thermal for water 
heating. All sectors, except buildings, see significant 
reduction in external costs related to air pollution. 
Reductions are similar in power and industry, where 
coal is, in part, substituted and offers significant 
improvements in air quality, and transport where 
electric mobility brings improvements to urban air 
quality. 
In total, the REmap Options reduce energy system 
costs around USD 1.2 billion annually by 2036, 
equivalent to USD -9.2 per MWh, and external costs by 
USD 1.2 billion annually from reduced adverse effects 
of air pollution on human health and environment 
and social damage from CO2
 (using the low 
estimate). However, the external cost savings could 
be as much as USD 7.9 billion annually by 2036 if 
the high estimate is used. Therefore, when including 
both reduced energy system and external costs, total 
savings to the Thai economy from the renewable 
technologies identified in REmap are at a minimum 
USD 2.4 billion (if only the low estimates is used) – or 
Air pollution and CO2 impacts
• External costs related to air pollution and CO2 
are important factors when considering the cost
and benefit proposition of renewable energy. For
instance, the REmap Options on average reduce
external costs related to air pollution alone by
around USD 1.2 billion annually by 2036.
• Compared to 2015, energy-related CO2 emissions
increase by 70% in the Reference Case to 420 Mt
by 2036, with the REmap Options slowing that
increase to 50%, or 370 Mt of energy-related CO2
in 2036.
Thailand will see a significant increase it energy 
demand of almost 80% by 2036. Therefore, similar 
increases in energy-related CO2
 are also seen, 
with an expected 70% increase in the Reference 
Case to almost 420 Mt annually by 2036 (see 
Figure 30). The increase in CO2 emissions outpaces 
fossil fuel growth (of 65%) because coal is expected 
to increase the most of all the fossil fuels, and coal 
is the most CO2 intensive of all fossil fuels.
The REmap Options result in a decrease in energyrelated CO2
 emissions of 12% over the Reference 
Case level in 2036. Thailand has set the goal to result in a reduction of 10% over the Reference 
Case. Therefore, additional efforts are needed 
if the country is to meet its intended goal of a 
20-25% reduction by 2030. It is important to note
that REmap does not assume that renewable energy 
will always substitute coal, rather it is also assumed
that some substitution of natural gas takes place.
During country consultation, some participants
advocated that the country is more interested
When assessing external costs, the more directly 
measurable effect of fossil fuels is on local air pollution. 
External costs related to air pollution from fossil fuels, 
largely resulting from adverse effects on human health, 
will increase by as much as 21% by 2036. Annual costs 
will increase from a range of USD 23-92 billion in 2015, 
to USD 28-108 billion by 2036. Figure 31 shows how 
these costs change in the different cases by showing 
the average costs under the low and high estimates. 
Air pollution costs associated with oil are the 
highest, due largely to the effect oil use in transport 
has in urban environments. However, the increase 
in external costs for oil in the Reference Case is 
the lowest, increasing by only 5%, reflecting both 
the lower increase in fuel demand expected in the 
transport sector compared to the other sectors, 
and more efficient and cleaner internal combustion 
in diversifying its energy mix than abating CO2
emissions, and for this reason coal should be 
considered as an important fuel. However, if the aim 
is energy diversification, the best option would be 
to consider higher levels of renewable deployment 
because they are indigenous sources of supply 
whereas coal will still need to be imported, and 
if the aim is CO2
 emission abatement then clearly 
renewable energy is the right choice.

savings, on the order of around of USD 2.3 billion

fuels, replacing coal with renewables results in the 
greatest savings. Lastly comes natural gas, which

Investment needs
• Thailand will need to invest significantly in its
energy system over the coming two decades. The 
Reference Case will see investments in renewable 
power and thermal capacity averaging USD 1.3
billion per year to 2036. The REmap Options
double that with an additional USD 1.3 billion
per year, resulting in a total average investment
need of USD 2.6 billion per year between 2015
and 2036 in renewable capacity for power and
thermal uses.
• Of the incremental investment need for the
REmap Options of USD 1.3 billion per year,
USD 0.4 billion per year will be investments
redirected from fossil fuels to renewables.
Significant investment in the energy system across 
Thailand is required due to the growing demand 
for energy. Investment is required across the 
entire energy system, in electricity generation, 
transmission, capacity for thermal uses, cooling 
and cooking, and in the transport sector.
During the period 2015-36, investment in 
renewable energy capacity will need to average 
USD 2.6 billion per year (see Figure 32). Of this, 
around half, USD 1.3 billion, is expected to take 
place in the Reference Case. The REmap Options 
will necessitate the mobilisation of an additional 
USD 0.9 billion per year in renewable energy 
investment from new sources, with USD 0.4 billion 
per year of investment redirected from fossil fuel 
into renewables. Investment in

Reference Case and REmap, 2015-2036KEY FINDINGS AND 
RECOMMENDATIONSThis chapter presents the key findings of the REmap analysis, followed by a 
portfolio of strategic and specific recommendations for addressing the key 
challenges. This portfolio of recommendations was largely developed through 
respondent interviews, multi-stakeholder discussions and workshops, and 
technical expert reviews.42 The aim of this section is to provide policy makers 
with “food for thought” for strategic thinking, as well as concrete actions that 
the government may take to overcome the emerging or potential challenges in 
scaling up renewable energy development and deployment in Thailand. 
5.1 Analytical highlights 
The analysis presented in Chapter 4 finds that Thailand has significant renewable 
energy potential, with a favourable set of circumstances that could enable the 
rapid scaling up of renewable energy beyond that envisioned in current plans. 
The analysis shows that renewables can be vital to help meet rapidly growing 
energy demand, with largely indigenous renewables. In doing so, energy system 
costs would be lower, and renewables would bring large benefits in terms of 
lower levels of air pollution and CO2
 emissions. Key highlights from the analysis 
are listed below.
Energy demand and role of renewables
AEDP 2015 sees energy demand in Thailand increasing by 78% under the assumption 
that GDP will grow by 126% by 2036. Growth in renewables outpaces this increase and 
the result is an increase in the renewable share of final energy in both the Reference 
Case and REmap. In REmap, renewables provide 37% of Thailand’s TFEC in 2036, 
surpassing by a wide margin the government’s current target of 30%.
05Electricity demand in AEDP 2015 grows by almost 
90% to over 325 TWh annually by 2036. The 
renewable power mix moves from one dominated by 
hydropower and bioenergy, to a much more diverse 
mix of technologies that includes sizable generation 
from solar PV and wind. By 2036 in REmap, 25% 
of domestic generation is supplied from renewable 
sources, and if imported hydropower is included, 
then almost 30% of electricity is renewable. The 
two greatest sources of additional potential are 
solar PV, increasing from 6 GW to 17 GW in the 
REmap Options, and onshore wind, doubling from 
3 GW to 6 GW. Therefore, greater attention should 
be paid to solar PV and wind power given the huge 
potential they present in the analysis. 
Importance of bioenergy
Bioenergy remains the dominant renewable source 
in the end-use sectors due to its ability to be 
used for heat and transport fuels. AEDP 2015, the 
source of the Reference Case, proposes aggressive 
targets for bioenergy, particularly in transport and 
industry. As a result, the REmap Options assume 
no additional biofuels in transport, and in industry 
the use of biomass residues and biogas increases 
only slightly by around 3%. For REmap the only 
sizable uptake of bioenergy assumes that a share 
of traditional biomass use that is replaced in the 
Reference Case by LPG can instead be replaced with 
modern cookstoves and biogas digesters, resulting 
in an increase in modern bioenergy in the residential 
sector by reversing the uptake of LPG. Therefore, 
a follow-up study focusing on modern cookstoves 
and biogas as a replacement for traditional use of 
biomass should be conducted. 
End-use sector importance
Solar thermal represents low-hanging fruit in the 
end-use sectors, as it can be scaled up significantly 
in buildings for water heating and in industry for 
low-temperature and pre-heating application. 
In the transport sector, REmap focuses on identifying 
the potential of EVs and as a result the demand 
for electricity in the sector triples. The number of 
passenger EVs on the road by 2036 would total 
1.5 million and electric two- and three-wheelers 
Cost and benefit
In the Reference Case, energy-related CO2 emissions 
increase by 70% by 2036 and air pollution from 
fossil fuels by 21%, the latter of which will cost 
the country on average USD 68 billion annually in 
health-related impacts.
The REmap Options are in general cheaper than 
their fossil fuel alternatives. Energy system costs 
would be reduced by USD 1.2 billion annually 
by 2036, equivalent to USD 9.2 per MWh, with 
a similar reduction in external costs ranging 
between USD 1.2 billion and USD 7.9 billion due 
to lower adverse effects on human health from air 
pollution and environmental damage from CO2. The 
power and buildings sectors see the most costcompetitive renewable technology options, with 
key technologies including solar PV, solar thermal 
and biogas.
Thailand will need to invest significantly in its 
energy system over the coming two decades. To 
achieve the levels of renewable energy capacity 
deployment seen in REmap, an average of 
USD 2.6 billion per year between 2015 and 2036 
will need to be invested in renewable capacity for 
power and thermal uses.
5.2 Strategic recommendations
With the global energy landscape becoming 
increasingly perplexing amid the ongoing energy 
transition, any energy-related plan needs to keep a 
certain level of flexibility to adapt to fast-changing 
circumstances, but, more importantly, to align itself 
as much as possible with key high-level political 
objectives and agendas at national, regional and 
international levels. This requires updating the 
AEDP on a regular basis to adjust the direction and 
the pace of implementation. But, it also suggests 
that the AEDP should take into consideration 
policy objectives other than simply energy, 
such as improving food security and farmers’ 
living standards, and enhancing the competitive 
advantage of the industrial sector. 
Although AEDP 2015 is one of the measures for 
Thailand to deliver its pledge of cutting 20-25% scenario by 2030, a closer harmonisation of 
climate and energy policies could facilitate the 
realisation of their interrelated objectives. This 
will not only help Thailand fulfil its international 
commitments to reduce greenhouse gases, but also 
reduce the external costs incurred by the country 
from the use of fossil fuels by USD 1.2-7.9 billion 
annually, according to the analysis presented in 
Chapter 4. From the energy perspective, Thailand 
should factor in the future constraint on carbon 
emissions when diversifying the energy mix. In 
practice, it is therefore advisable to synchronise 
the timeframes and evaluation cycles for the AEDP 
and Thailand’s NDCs to mitigate energy-related 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
A further strategic perspective is to develop 
renewable energy manufacturing industries in 
Thailand, which is also in line with the Thailand 
Industries 4.0,43 through scaling up the size of 
the market for renewable energy. This would 
enable Thailand to capture the resultant social and 
economic benefits, including the creation of new 
local jobs and additional income streams.44
Currently, most renewable energy technologies are 
imported while a small portion of components are 
provided locally. Building on the country’s existing 
manufacturing facilities, technical expertise and strong 
R&D capacity, Thailand should consider developing a 
strategic approach to increase the competitiveness 
of local manufacturing through market development, 
so as to minimise overdependence on imported 
technologies and maximise the benefits for local 
communities. This may include, for instance, the 
local bio-economy utilising the entire value chain 
of locally produced bioenergy, local expertise in 
solar thermal technologies, the development of 
solar PV and wind power generation technologies, 
and EV manufacturing capacity (including two- and 
three-wheelers) in Thailand. Over time, this would 
generate significant positive impacts on Thailand’s 
development. Therefore, it is advisable to take a 
long-term macroeconomic approach to assessing 
the benefits that can arise from the energy choices 
to be made today. This longer-term macroeconomic 
benefit is further supported by the REmap findings, 
which show that renewables are, on the whole, 
less expensive than fossil fuels and would result in 
Lastly, to ensure the effective implementation of 
the interlinked key targets set in the TIEB – which 
consists of five individual plans including the AEDP, 
EEP and PDP –- there is a need for stronger and 
higher-level of co-ordination and co-operation 
among the ministries and the relevant institutions.
Among the five individual plans within the TIEB, the 
EEP serves as a starting point, contributing as an 
input for the development of the PDP. The target set 
in AEDP 2015 is to some extent contingent on both 
the EEP and the PDP. Plans for oil and natural gas 
would also have significant implications for all three 
abovementioned plans. Such interdependency 
would cause some concern as to implementation 
efficacy should no effective inter-institutional co 
ordination mechanism be put in place. For the EEP, 
it is worth noting that certain other ministries and 
authorities, such as the transport sector, may play 
a more important role than the MoE in meeting the 
energy-saving targets. 
The system for monitoring progress and exchange 
of information, including relevant data among the 
key institutions, has been established and is in 
operation at the working level under the oversight 
of EPPO.45 In addition, joint task forces were initiated 
enabling DEDE to work more effectively with other 
ministries for implementation of AEDP 2015. 
However, there remains a lack of effective 
ministerial-level co ordination for harmonisation of 
policy objectives and long-term vision among the 
different ministries involved. This has a negative 
impact on the overall effectiveness of the TIEB 
implementation if overlaps in interest occur 
among ministries. For instance, the management 
of agricultural crops is under MoAC, while biofuelbased vehicle manufacturing sits with the Ministry 
of Industry and the use of such vehicles is under the 
oversight of the Ministry of Transport. 
It is therefore recommended that the existing 
mechanisms designed to achieve ministerial-level 
co-ordination on energy-related issues should be

 Publications/IRENA_Leveraging_for_Solar_PV_2017_summary.pdf.revisited, with the aim of exploring the possibility 
of using established mechanisms to harmonise 
policy objectives and the strategic agenda under 
the different ministries. 
In addition, given that it is crucial to collect and share 
implementation data from all the relevant agencies 
to keep implementation on track, it would better 
to establish a mechanism to do so on a regular 
basis in place of the current ad-hoc reporting that 
is performed only when such data are requested 
by senior management at the ministries. Related 
to this point, Thailand should also keep abreast of 
development of renewable energy technologies 
and applications in other regions, countries and 
projects, especially those where dramatic cost 
reductions are achieved as presented in The Power 
to Change: Solar and Wind Cost Reduction Potential 
to 2025 (IRENA, 2016d). Comparative analysis on 
this front can provide valuable insights and inputs 
for the review and updating of the current AEDP, 
as well as for project developers and investors in 
Thailand.
5.3 Key challenges and specific 
recommendations 
This section discusses the key challenges identified 
in the categories of energy planning, renewable 
energy resources, and technology applications. The 
specific recommendations are given on the basis of 
the systematic assessment of the current status of 
renewable energy development in Thailand through 
the RRA process, and the results of the REmap 
analysis which presents a renewable energy outlook 
to 2036 based on the one described in AEDP 2015, 
as well as with reference to international best 
practice and relevant IRENA studies.
Power grid planning
Challenges
At present, VRE accounts for less than 2% of total 
electricity generation in Thailand, with the REmap 
Options increasing this share to 12% by 2036. There 
is a growing concern among government agencies 
and utilities that higher shares of variable renewable 
generation require greater levels of grid flexibility. 
While many power systems around the world have 
how Thailand’s power system, and importantly 
its distribution-level systems, can better plan for 
increasing amounts of VRE. 
The recently proposed requirements for all SPPs 
and VSPPs to provide firm or semi-firm capacity 
in their renewable energy projects by hybridising 
biomass with either solar PV or wind power is 
one of the measures that power system operators 
and utilities have taken. This is likely to push up 
overall project development costs to offer flexibility 
that may not even be necessary, thereby actually 
increasing prices. Furthermore, the implications for 
the extent to which project development will be 
affected, especially in cost terms, remain unclear. 
While technical considerations based on local 
power system dynamics need to be understood, it is 
important is to embrace new concepts, approaches 
and tools in power grid planning, operation 
and market design to improve grid operation 
performance. 
Recommendations
Diversifying the sources of variable renewables can 
reduce the requirement for spinning reserves, but 
this does not necessarily have to be achieved at 
the project level, especially if one wants to achieve 
greater system-wide cost-effectiveness. Optimising 
the portfolio by setting a ratio for VRE sources, such 
as solar PV and wind, based on their output curves 
to maximise complementarity with one another can 
deliver cost-effective results at the system level. 
However, other options are available, for instance 
matching VRE outputs with load as much as 
possible using intelligent control systems, including 
adopting demand-side management schemes. 
From a long-term perspective, there might be 
a need to establish an auxiliary market to enable 
independent regulating power providers to take a 
more active role in different market segments so as 
to ensure grid stability and reliability. Furthermore, 
such a market could incentivise the potential 
application of batteries or EVs among other energy 
storage facilities. It is therefore advisable that 
Thailand conducts a feasibility study on establishing 
a market for better utilisation of existing and 
potential reserve margins. other forms of renewable energy sources as eligible 
renewables contributing to the national target. 
This issue is likely to emerge when it comes to 
discussion of allocating contributions to the regional 
renewable energy target agreed by the ASEAN 
Energy Ministers, i.e. achieving 23% renewables in 
TPEC by 2025. Moreover, this might also affect the 
way in which the rules for a renewable electricity 
certificate (REC) are set if a regional renewable 
electricity market were established and RECs were 
considered a suitable market-oriented measure for 
ASEAN to take. In the immediate and short term, 
were the definition of renewable expanded to 
include imported renewable electricity in meeting 
the domestic renewable energy target of Thailand, 
potential investors and developers would be 
incentivised to explore the resources along national 
borders or scale up existing installations close 
to the border lines that can provide electricity to 
broader customer groups and thus achieve better 
economic performance. This would also facilitate 
investment in enhancing grid interconnections with 
neighbouring countries.
Long-term price guarantee mechanisms for 
bioenergy feedstock
Challenges
Most of the industries utilising agricultural and 
forestry residuals as energy feedstock can increase 
to some extent the supply of feedstock by, for 
instance, improving harvesting methods (from 
burnt to green harvesting). 
However, large-scale users of feedstock for either 
power generation or biofuel production would have 
to purchase biomass feedstock on the competitive 
market if they do not own any dedicated energy 
crops farm. The conflicts of interest among 
the various sectors may pose a supply risk to 
them, as a substantial proportion of the existing 
agricultural and forestry residues are treated as 
a commodity and their accessibility is subject 
to market conditions. Increasing the awareness 
of using biomass in industrial processes and the 
buildings sector and unused residues for other 
purposes might worsen the situation if no effective 
mechanism for sustainable management of the 
feedstock can be established. 
Recommendations
First is the requirement for clear policy and legal 
frameworks on land tenure and use. This is one of the 
basic elements that enable long-term commitment 
and investment in agriculture, especially at the levels 
that are required to sustain a strong bioenergy sector 
that does not compete with food production. Loose 
land tenure and use frameworks do not provide the 
confidence necessary for developers to invest in the 
technical developments that are required to boost 
agricultural yields and maximise output from land in 
the long term. 
Secondly, to address these challenges, the essential 
elements are a) to establish a fair and reasonable 
market environment with a clear pricing mechanism for 
biomass that can offer long-term purchase guarantees, 
based on projected demand, and b) to smooth out as 
much as possible the seasonal variation in feedstock 
yields. Such market environment would, for example, 
benefit from the creation of growers’ associations 
and co operatives, which, with biomass buyers, help 
establish clear rules for the operation of the market.
To some extent, the commodity price volatility in 
international markets should also be factored out. 
This would help minimise the negative impact of oil 
price volatility on the farmers’ economy, and in return 
enhance their confidence in investment in energy 
crops. Additionally, prices should in principle be stable 
or predictable over the long term, and should not be 
set too high or too low in relation to food prices. In 
this way, the price of feedstock can be controlled or 
guaranteed over the long term. Additionally, this can 
facilitate land-use planning by MoAC and MoNRE as 
far as dedicated energy crops are concerned. 
The ultimate objective is to establish biomass 
supply chains that ensure the delivery of reliable, 
high-quality and affordable biomass fuels to those 
industries that are willing to use biomass, while at 
the same time diversifying income streams for local 
farms without introducing potential risks.46 The 
development of such supply chains could benefit 
multiple users of different part of the biomass 
feedstock. Yet it should be made clear that food 
security for both human and animal/livestock must 
remain the top priority. Thirdly, a fair and sound regulatory framework 
should be put in place to ensure a fair distribution of 
the benefits between farmers and energy producers, 
particularly when deals go through processing 
collection companies (including agricultural co 
operatives that are operating as a collector in some 
places), processing mills, and other businesses 
involved.
Lastly, the application of new technologies for 
managing feedstocks and derived products should 
be encouraged, for instance solid biomass pellets, 
provided they can meet the expected/desired levels 
of quality assurance. 
Incentives for thermal utilisation of renewable 
energy sources
Challenges
Renewable energy for thermal utilisation accounts 
nearly for two-thirds of the total of the increment 
by 2036, if the AEDP 2015 target is met as projected 
in the plan. The majority of it would come from 
biomass according to the plan. However, the current 
subsidy programmes cover only solar water heaters 
and dryers. Except in the case of biomass processing 
industries that traditionally utilise biomass residues 
for their own thermal needs, the lack of sufficient 
incentives for end users to switch to modern 
renewables for thermal utilisation impedes the 
development of this segment of market, although 
various technological options have been identified 
in AEDP 2015 and the analysis in this study. 
Furthermore, the REmap analysis shows that, in 
addition to the increases in AEDP 2015, significant 
additional potential exists for solar thermal heating 
solutions in both buildings and industry beyond 
that detailed in AEDP 2015.
Recommendations
Against this backdrop, Thailand should set the 
right policy framework for the use of renewable 
thermal energy,47 and introduce a set of dedicated 
incentive schemes as it did for promoting the use 
of renewable energy sources in the power and 
transport sectors. However, the contrasts in market 
structure, opportunities and barriers between 
power and thermal use of renewables should also 
be recognised. 
To achieve this, a statistical system is required that 
can collect and assemble the right set of energy 
metrics for renewable thermal use. Toward this 
end, it is recommended that Thailand conduct a 
comprehensive study reviewing its current data 
system, including the scope of technologies covered 
and the ways in which data are collected, assembled, 
reported and analysed for the applications of 
renewable thermal energy. 
Demand assessment is another important element. 
For example, solar water heating in Thailand offers 
an economically attractive option for the tourism 
industry, particularly in the southern Thailand; 
by the same token, so do solar dryers for the 
agricultural sector, and potentially solar thermal for 
cooling in the buildings sector given the country’s 
high cooling demand during daylight hours. 
Therefore, studies are required to look further into 
the feasibility of potential applications, followed by 
a promotional strategy.
Based on the results, the right set of policies and 
incentive schemes for the use of renewables in 
sectors other than just electricity could be developed 
and effectively implemented, and the market for 
renewables for thermal use could be built. 
Long-term plan for electric mobility
Challenges
Thailand has developed a strong automobile 
industry. The government has set ambitious 
targets promoting the use of biofuels in AEDP 
2015 while at the same time aiming to have 
1.2 million EVs (including BEVs and PHEVs) in the 
EEP. To some extent, this has confused the car 
manufacturers, who are increasingly uncertain 
about the government’s long-term development 
strategy and policy and technology choice for the 
transport sector. This has been recognised as the 
greatest challenge, in part because all the cars and 
engines manufactured in Thailand are designed by 
overseas parent companies and it would require a 
great deal of time for them to adapt to a change in 
technological preference. 
47 Including solar thermal for cooling systems using absorption chillers.From the government perspective, EVs present 
obvious advantages when it comes to reducing 
demand for imported transport fuels, exhaust gas 
emissions and transport noise in cities, and more 
importantly, benefiting from the advantages to 
power system management from the dispatchable 
electric energy stored in the batteries of EVs. 
With the global trend towards EV development 
and the potential regional and global market, it 
can be anticipated that the Thai government will 
increasingly step up its support for the development 
of EVs. However, there is a concern from the 
automotive industry with regard to the potential 
risk of creating competition for market share 
between EVs and biofuel vehicles if policy and the 
supporting schemes are not carefully designed. 
Recommendations
Despite EV technologies and applications having 
rapidly evolved in many regions across the world, 
they remain in their infancy compared to the use 
of conventional transport vehicles, and are often 
suitable only for urban transport due to current 
technological and infrastructure constraints. 
However, with better and proactive planning for 
technological and infrastructure development, EVs 
could have an important role as an alternative to 
petroleum-derived transport fuels in Thailand. 
EVs have various challenges such as battery 
capacity, mileage constraints, safety issues, and 
the need for charging stations. For the future 
development of EVs, technological innovation in 
the transport and power sectors are key. Therefore 
Thailand should strengthen its R&D capacity in EVs 
and develop the local expertise and knowledge in 
the field of EV design and manufacturing, and its 
interactions with other fields such as power system 
management and smart grids. 
Secondly, Thailand should avoid a rapid change in 
policy direction. To this end, it is recommended that 
Thailand develop a long-term strategic development 
plan or roadmap for the transport sector, covering 
vehicles, fuel types and the necessary infrastructure. 
If the corresponding policies could ensure that EVs 
gradually penetrate the local market while aiming 
at overseas markets through exports, this would 
provide the industry with enough lead time to plan 
for the transition. This would also help the power 
sector, especially the distribution network operators, 
to prepare for accommodating and managing EV 
charging. The bottom line is to develop a longterm clear and consistent policy framework for 
transport sector development, with concrete stepby-step action plans for each of the development 
stages. They must be endorsed or jointly developed 
by the key ministries. With these, the automobile 
industry will be able to prepare its business plans 
accordingly. 
Lastly, in the current context of automobile 
industry development in Thailand, four specific 
recommendations can serve as a starting point:
1. Tap into electric two- and three-wheeler
markets (including tuk-tuks) and establish the
local manufacturing capacity to deliver quality
products at acceptable prices for Thailand.
There is no competition with conventional
car manufacturers in this market segment. As
projected in the REmap analysis, there could be
as many as 3.5 million electric two- and threewheelers on the road by 2036.
2. For electric four-wheelers, Thailand could
start with the market for fixed-route means of
transport with a predicable distance range, such
as public buses, light freight vehicles for delivery
services, and sightseeing or tour buses. This
would also help the industry collect operational
data for further improvement, and demonstrate
the benefits of EVs to the potential users, and
reduce air pollution in cities.
3. Thailand might want to consider incentivising
the voluntary replacement of obsolete vehicles
on the road with EVs by providing a certain
amount of subsidy.
4. Thailand should increase investment in charging
facilities for EVs, including on-street charging
for urban EVs and two-/three-wheelers as well
as fast-charging stations.REFERENCES

methodology, assessment 
approach and data sources
This annex details the REmap methodology and 
summarises the key assumptions and methods 
used for the Thailand analysis. REmap is a roadmap 
of technology options to increase the global share 
of renewables. It involves a bottom-up, iterative 
analysis of 70 countries (as of early 2017). For 
selected countries the analysis is deepened and 
detailed in in-depth country reports, working 
papers, or other formats. This report is the first 
to summarise in-depth country analysis with a 
combined IRENA Renewable Readiness Assessment. 
Therefore, the REmap contribution to this report is 
limited to providing a perspective on energy use 
developments based on the REmap analysis that is 
presented in Chapter 4.
REmap engagement with Thailand began in early 
2016 with preparations for the REmap ASEAN 
regional report, co-authored with the ASEAN Centre 
for Energy (ACE). This regional REmap roadmap, 
Renewable Energy Outlook for ASEAN: A REmap 
Analysis (IRENA and ACE, 2016), was released in 
October 2016 and was the culmination of numerous 
consultative workshops and meetings with ASEAN 
member states. The focus of the roadmap was to 
provide a perspective to these member states on 
how they could achieve their aspirational objective 
of reaching a renewable energy share of 23% in 
TPES by 2025 – a significant increase over the 10% 
share in 2014 (the target’s base year). 
With the release of the report, the 10 ASEAN 
member states were added to the REmap 
country grouping, which as of early 2017 includes 
70 countries representing over 90% of global 
energy demand. Figure 33 details those countries, 
with the dark green countries being dedicated 
REmap countries, middle green showing countries 
that are included in regional roadmaps such as the 
ASEAN REmap outlook, and light green including 
countries covered by IRENA’s numerous activities in 
Africa that also feed into the REmap analysis. 
Figure 33. REmap countries (map)
nations employed here do not imply any opinion or position on the part of IRENA about any region, 
r territory on concerning the delimitation of frontiers or boundaries.The REmap analysis for this report builds on the 
initial analysis conducted for Thailand as part of 
the REmap ASEAN regional report by expanding 
and deepening the scope of the analysis and 
assessment for Thailand. As part of the joint RRAREmap process, IRENA has interacted with the 
Government of Thailand over the course of 2016 
and 2017 through two consultative workshops and 
numerous meetings to deepen understanding of 
the potential of renewables in the country.
The REmap analysis for Thailand utilises an 
internally developed IRENA REmap tool that 
incorporates data and analysis done by IRENA 
and Thai experts for energy system developments 
and renewable potential in the country. It provides 
assumptions and a standardised REmap approach 
for assessment of technologies in terms of their 
costs, investments and benefits.
The REmap analysis assumes two key future years: 
• 2025 – to provide a near-term perspective on
renewable energy development in Thailand
and to allow comparability and insights into
Thailand’s role in the ASEAN region’s aspirational 
target for renewable energy for that year
• 2036 – to provide a perspective on renewable
energy in relation to Thailand’s AEDP.
The REmap analysis starts by building the energy 
balance of a country, using 2015 as the base year of 
the analysis, based on national data and statistics. 
The country then provides its latest national 
energy plans and targets for renewables and fossil 
fuels, collated to produce a business-as-usual 
perspective of the energy system, referred to as the 
Reference Case. This includes TFEC for each enduse sector (buildings, industry and transport) and 
distinguishes between power, district heating and 
direct uses of energy with a breakdown by energy 
carrier for the period 2015-36. 
Once the Reference Case is ready, the additional 
renewable energy potential by technology is 
investigated for each sector. The potential of these 
technologies is described as REmap Options.
48
Each REmap Option replaces a non-renewable 
energy technology49 to deliver the same energy 
Throughout this study, the renewable energy share 
is estimated in relation to TFEC50 in general, but 
also occasionally in relation to TPES to allow for 
comparison with shares associated with the ASEAN 
renewable energy target (for 2025 for instance). 
Modern renewable energy excludes traditional uses 
of bioenergy.51 The share of modern renewable 
energy in TFEC is equal to total modern renewable 
energy consumption in end-use sectors (including 
consumption of renewable electricity and district 
heat, and direct use of renewables), divided by 
TFEC. The share of renewables in power generation 
is also calculated. The renewable energy share can 
also be expressed in terms of the direct use of 
renewables only. The renewable energy use by enduse sector covers the areas described below.
• Buildings include the residential, commercial
and public sectors. Renewable energy is used
in direct applications for heating, cooling or
cooking purposes or as renewable electricity.
• Industry includes the manufacturing and mining
sectors, in which renewable energy is consumed
in direct-use applications (e.g. process heat or
refrigeration) and electricity from renewable
sources. It also includes agriculture.
• Transport sector, which can make direct use of
renewables through the consumption of liquid
and gaseous biofuels or through electricity
generated using renewable energy technologies.
Metrics for assessing REmap Options
To assess the costs of REmap Options, substitution 
costs are calculated. This report also discusses the 
costs and savings of renewable energy deployment 
48 An approach based on options rather than scenarios is deliberate. REmap
is an exploratory study and not a target-setting exercise.
49 Non-renewable technologies encompass fossil fuels, non-sustainable uses 
 of bioenergy (referred to here as traditional bioenergy) and nuclear power. 
As a supplement to this report’s annex, a detailed list of these technologies 
and related background data are provided on the REmap website.
50 TFEC is the energy delivered to consumers as electricity, heat or fuels
that can be used directly as a source of energy. This consumption is 
usually subdivided into transport, industry, residential, commercial and 
public buildings, and agriculture. It excludes non-energy uses of fuels.
51 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
 defines traditional biomass use as woodfuels, agricultural by-products and 
 dung burned for cooking and heating purposes (FAO, 2000). In developing 
 countries, traditional biomass is still widely harvested and used in an 
 unsustainable, inefficient and unsafe way. It is mostly traded informally and and related externalities due to climate change and 
air pollution. Experts devised four main indicators: 
substitution costs, system costs, total investment 
needs and needs for renewable energy investment 
support.
Substitution costs
Each renewable and non-renewable technology has 
its own individual cost relative to the non-renewable 
energy that it replaces. This is explained in detail 
in the REmap methodology (IRENA, 2014a) and is 
depicted in the following equation:
For each REmap Option, the analysis considers 
the cost of substituting a non-renewable energy 
technology to deliver an identical amount of heat, 
electricity or energy service. The cost of each 
REmap Option is represented by its substitution 
cost:
52,53
This indicator provides a comparable metric for all 
renewable energy technologies identified in each 
sector. Substitution costs are the key indicators 
for assessing the economic viability of REmap 
Options. They depend on the type of conventional 
technology substituted, energy prices and the 
characteristics of the REmap Option. The cost 
can be positive (additional) or negative (savings) 
because many renewable energy technologies 
are, or could be, more cost-effective by 2036 than 
conventional technologies.
System costs
indicator is the sum of the differences between 
the total capital and operating expenditures of all 
energy technologies based on their deployment in 
REmap and the Reference Case in 2025 and 2036. 
Investment needs
Investment needs for renewable energy capacity 
can also be assessed. The total investment needs 
of technologies in REmap are higher than in 
the Reference Case due to the increased share 
of renewables. On average, these have greater 
investment needs than the non-renewable energy 
technology equivalent. The capital investment cost 
in USD per kW of installed capacity in each year 
is multiplied with the deployment in that year to 
arrive at total annual investment costs. The capital 
investment costs of each year are then added up 
for the period 2015-36. Net incremental investment 
needs are the sum of the differences between the 
total investment costs for all renewable and nonrenewable energy technologies in power generation 
and stationary applications in REmap and the 
Reference Case in the period 2015-36 for each year. 
This total was then turned into an annual average 
for the period.
Renewable energy investment support needs
Renewable energy investment support needs can 
also be approximated on the basis of the REmap 
tool. Total requirements for renewable investment 
52 Substitution cost is the difference between the annualised cost of the
REmap Option and the annualised cost of the substituted non-renewable 
technology used to produce the same amount of energyThis is divided by

xsupport in all sectors are estimated as the difference 
in the delivered energy service cost (e.g. in USD per 
kWh or USD per GJ from a government perspective) 
for the renewable option against the dominant 
incumbent. This difference is multiplied by the 
deployment for that option in that year to arrive 
at an investment support total for that technology. 
The differences for all REmap Options are added 
together to provide an annual investment support 
requirement for renewables. The renewable option 
is not subtracted from the total if it has a lower 
delivered energy service cost than the incumbent 
option. By the 2030s, this is an increasing trend.
Government and business perspectives
Based on the substitution cost and the potential of 
each REmap Option, country cost-supply curves are 
developed from the perspective of governments. 
This Government perspective allows a comparison 
across countries and a country cost-benefit analysis; 
it shows the cost of the transition as governments 
would calculate it. This perspective excludes energy 
taxes and subsidies and a standard discount rate of 
10% (for non-OECD countries) was used. 
Externality analysis
Several externality reductions obtained through 
REmap Options are considered. They include health 
effects from outdoor or indoor exposure to pollution 
in the case of traditional bioenergy, as well as effects 
on agricultural yields. In addition, the external costs 
associated with the social and economic impacts of 
CO2
 are estimated (IRENA, 2016a). 
Further documentation and a detailed description 
of the REmap methodology can be found at 
www.irena.org/REmap. Further details on metrics 
for assessing REmap Options can be consulted in 
the appendix of the 2016 global report (IRENA, 
2016a). Finally, energy supply and demand numbers 
in this report are generally provided in petajoules 
(PJ) or exajoules (EJ), the standard for REmap. In 
Thailand, commonly used units are tonnes of oil 
equivalent (toe). The relevant conversion factors 
are listed below:
• 1 GJ = 0.0238 toe
• 1 GJ = 277.78 kilowatt hour (kWh)
• 1 PJ = 0.0238 million toe
• 1 PJ = 277.78 gigawatt hour (GWh)
• 1 EJ = 23.88 million toe
• 1 EJ = 277.78 terawatt-hour (TWh).
