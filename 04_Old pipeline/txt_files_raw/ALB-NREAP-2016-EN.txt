Albania as one of the Contractual Parties of the Energy Community Treaty is obliged to transpose and to be in 
compliance with the EU Directive 2009/28/EC “On the enhancement of the use of energy from renewable 
resources”. One of the requests of the law 138/2013 “On Renewable Energy Resources” and of this Directive is 
the preparation and the approval of the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (NREAP), which establishes 
national objectives of renewable energies in the final total domestic consumption as well as the supporting measures 
to achieve them.
Also, Albanian Government considers the promotion of renewable energies implementation as an important means 
of energy policies to increase the security for energy supply, economic development, energy sector sustainability and 
environment protection. 
Even though Albania ensures over 90% of the power from the hydropower stations, a considerable part of the 
energy is imported. This part varies – depending on the annual conditions- between 30% and 60%^ of the Total 
Supply with Prime Energy. Renewable energies might be a solution for the reduction of this dependence from the 
imports and it might improve not only the security for the supply with energy, but even the macroeconomic and 
political security of the country decreasing the country budget deficit.
Based on these facts, which offer the context for potential increase of the EREs role in the current situation of 
energy and economy in Albania, and based upon the principles of energy and the added domestic economic value, 
the potential objectives of EREs policies have been passed: 
I. Consumption of renewable energy resources at the measure of 38% in 2020; 
II. Desertification of domestic renewable resources, not only from the water resources but even from wind, 
sun, biomass and geothermal energy; the use of domestic energy resources, especially in the remote areas 
providing vacancies and improving the living standards. 
III. The increase of the contribution of bio-fuels and other burning materials from renewable resources with 
10% in the total of fuel consumption in transport sector until 2020. 
The increase of the use of EREs technologies is an essential step in general towards a more sustainable society and 
in particular it brings considerable benefits for Albanian industry. 
ERE’s 38% objective was passed in the Decision of the Council of Ministers of Energy Community 2012/04/MCEnC. 
General National Objective
The year 2009 will be the starting point in the National Objective for ERE. In this year the EGFC was 2,104 ktoe 
and ERE percentage in consumption terms was 31.2%. Implementing the approach determined in the Directive, 
pursuant to technologies, the basic data are provided for ERE promotion. 
Renewable energy for ERE-T transport sector: In order for the ERE consumption National Objective of 38% 
to be accomplished in 2020, the consumption of 3% for the Albanian territory of EGFC has been predicted. 
Otherwise, the mixture up to the measure of 10% in the volume of fuels of the renewable burning materials 
(FAME), consumed in the Transport sector, has been predicted. This amount is equal with at least 75 ktoe FAME 
for the transport sector in 2020. This amount of the renewable part in biofuels takes into consideration the increase 
with 60 ktoe in 2020 compared to 2014.
Renewable energy for heating and cooling sector ERE-H&C: in order for the ERE consumption National 
Objective of 38% to be accomplished in 2020, it is necessary that the consumption of 10% of EGFC in the 
Albanian territory, which has to be consumed in the Heating and Cooling system, ERE-H&C, is consumed. This 
amount means an additional increase of the heat with at least 800 GWh/year in 2020 or an annual consumption of 
ERE-H&C of 2/9 ktoe heat from wood/industrial/waste and heating pumps biomass. 
Renewable energy for energy sector, ERE-E: In order for ERE consumption National Objective of 38% in 
2020, it is necessary that the amount of 29% of EGFC, used in energy sector, ERE-E, in the Albanian territory is 
consumed. This amount means an additional increase of at least 270 ktoe (3,140 GWh) until 2020. Also, this means 
an average increase of energy generators from renewable resources in the amount of 830 MW (20-35% capacity 
factor) which are proposed to be divided according to the summarizing table:Consumption in Albania after 2015 until 2020.

1. RES ACTUAL SITUATION IN ALBANIA
1.1 Introduction and historic overview
The supply with prime energy in Albania has been dominated by fuel, hydropower plants and biomass. 
Domestic energy sector has been supported by energy imports, especially by fuel products and energy 
imports. Historically, energy needs have been accomplished almost exclusively by the hydropower plants. 
The total installed energy capacity in Albania reaches up to 1.8 GW, dominated by hydropower plants. 
Water resources are the most important natural resources in Albania and the general hydropower 
potential is assessed up to 4.500 MW. Today, the country has exploited only 35% of the hydropower 
stations potential. The hydropower stations established and linked on the cascade on the river Drin 
represent about 80% of the total energy production. 
The changes in power production might be attributed to the unstable production from the hydropower 
plants. Furthermore, the country suffers from significant transmission and delivery losses – which are 
technical and non-technical – which were assessed up to 44.96% in 2012, according to ERE, and due to 
the tough and active measures undertaken by the Albanian Government, they fell up to 29% in the first 
six months of 2015. 
As the water conditions change year after year, the country is compelled to support on energy export at a 
large measure. The increasing requests for energy have increased even the support of Albania in energy 
import. Especially, during the first decade (2001-2010), energy final request increased with an annual 
average norm of 4.8%. On the other side, energy generating capacity increased by an annual norm of 
0.6%. The country has changed from an energy exporter into an importer. For this reason, the generating 
capacity extension is one of the main priorities of energy policies sector in Albania. The future 
development of energy capacity has been planned mainly along the rivers Mat, Vjosa, Devoll and Bistrica. 
Apart from this, the Albanian government has been focused on the diversification of its supply with 
energy and the promotion of other renewable energy resources, such as biomass, solar energy and wind 
energy. 
Albania has a considerable potential of RER. Its solar power potential has been assessed in 1,500-1,700 
kWh/m2 per year. The country has also unexploited potentials of wind power, especially along the 
Adriatic coastline. According to the Albanian Agency of Investment Developments a series of zones have 
been identified with high potential of wind energy, with an average annual wind speed of 6-8 m/s and 
with energy density of 250-600 W/m2. Albania has also considerable potential of biomass from 
agricultural waste, which is assessed approximately about 2,300 GWh/year. The heat from renewable 
resources, which is being offered from the inefficient use of firewood, is promoted mainly through the 
implementation of solar systems for water heating, industrial biomass and agricultural biomass. As long as 
energy production system is concerned, despite the hydropower stations, which is the main RES 
technology, it is expected to expand considerably up to the year 2020. The other RES technologies such 
as wind, biomass ore solar power are expected to play a limited role, even though considerable potential 
exists.
The developments in energy final consumption indicate the domination of fuel products. From 1990 up 
to 2013, a considerable decrease might be noticed in the contribution of solid combustibles, that means 
coal and natural gas. In 2013, transport sector was the greatest energy consumer, with about 40% of the 
final total consumption, followed by the residential sector (27%), industry (17%), service sector (9%) and 
at the end agriculture (5%). 
Albania as one of the Contractual Parties of Energy Community Treaty is compelled to transpose and to 
be in compliance with the EU Directive 2009/28/EC “On the enhancement of energy use from 
renewable resources and it must amend and then abrogate Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC”. 
This comes even as a request of Law 138/2013 “On Energy Renewable Resources”. One of the requests 
of law and of this Directive is the preparation and the approval of the National Action Plan for 
Renewable Energy (NREAP), which would stipulate the national objectives on renewable energies in the [7]
final consumption of domestic energy. On the other hand, Albanian government has considered the 
promotion of renewable energy use as an important tool of energy policies for the increase of the security 
for energy supply, economic development, energy sector sustainability and environment protection. Even 
though, in Albania, more than 95% of energy and 20-23% of primary total resources have been provided 
by hydropower stations, the objectives of Albanian Government energy policy intend to increase further 
more the use of RER. 
In the last decade all over the world, the greatest part of the debate in relation to the encouragement for 
the implementation of renewable resources has been focused on the financial support schemes and the 
improvement of the conditions in network connection for renewable energy. There is no doubt that these 
are the main issues which continue to remain in the centre of the policy-makers’ attention today and in 
the future. 
Albania is a special case because domestic energy production is realized mostly by the use of big and 
medium hydropower plants. Also, about 10-13% of the Total Energy Primary Resources (TEPR) in the 
country – including the imports – is ensured by biomass, and especially from the firewood. 
On the other hand, Albania carries out important imports of energy which according to the annual 
conditions, change from 30-60% of the TEPR. Renewable energy might t be the solution for the decrease 
of this strategic dependence on the imports and the improvement not only of the security for energy 
supply but even of the macroeconomic and political security of the country decreasing the domestic 
budget deficit. 
Based on these facts which offer the context for the potential increase of the role of RES in the current 
energy and economy condition in Albania, based even on the energy security principles and on the added 
domestic economic value, the potential objectives of RES policies have been approved. The increase of 
the use of technologies RESis a step of special importance in general towards a more sustainable society 
and in particular it brings considerable benefits for Albanian industry. The argument of added value in 
domestic economy shall be used in the decision-making process for the new supporting schemes towards 
RES. The support of RES installations might offer an opportunity of importance for the development of 
local areas which are relatively poor. 
1.2 OFFER and DEMAND for energy
Based on Energy National Balance 2009, where the general net consumption of the primary energy 
resources is 2100.93 ktoe, where just 449.82 was produced ny the hydropower stations, 210 ktoe is the 
contribution from biomass, solar power is 6.65 ktoe and in total all the RES are 666.47 ktoe (equal to 
31.2% of energy final consumption in 2009). Meanwhile, according to the last energy balance for Albania 
issued by the Natural Resources National Centre (NRNC) in 2013, from a general net consumption of 
energy primary resources of 2345.90 ktoe, just 592.72 ktoe are from the hydropower plants, biomass 
contribution is 201.50 ktoe, solar power is 11,92 ktoe, non fuels 35 ktoe, and in total all the RES are equal 
to 846.63 (equal to 33.20% of energy gross final consumption in 2013). 
Historically, Albania has gone through a high abnormal increase of energy consumption. A considerable 
part of this increase has been encouraged artificially by the extraordinary levels of energy theft, the failure 
to pay the energy bills and in some cases by the tariffs under cost. The high consumption of energy in the 
sector of buildings, especially to heat the buildings, has caused that a valuable resource is removed by the 
trade and industrial use which otherwise would create vacancies and would contribute in the economic 
growth. The measure taken by the Albanian Government recently for the prevention of energy nonpayment (reduced from 52% in 2013 to about 29,8% for the first six months of 2015) have removed one 
of the main obstacles for the introduction of RES and the energy efficient measures for both sides of 
Albanian energy system: the request and the supply. 
2. OBJECTIVE FOR RES IN ALBANIA
2.1 National Objective for RES[8]
The main intention of the new EU Directive for renewable energy (Directive 2009/28) is the 
determination of mandatory objectives for the use of energy for renewable resources. The Directive 
stipulates a general objective of 20% for EU and individual objectives for the Member States based on 
their current renewable energy level and their economic development level. Within the general objective 
for RES, there is a specific obligation that 10% of the energy that is used in the transport sector is 
provided from the renewable resources. 
The same approach, but with another base year (2009 instead of 2005) has been applied to calculate the 
individual objectives of each Contractual Party in Energy Community, exactly for Albania, there is an 
Objective of 38% and the specific obligation within this Objective to fulfill 10% of the energy used in 
transport by renewable resources. 
The objective of 38% from RES has been adopted in the Decision of the Council of Ministers 
2012/04/MC-EnC, when the Directive of RES was approved for the Energy Community. 
In table 1 below, there are all the predicted figures of the final energy gross consumption of all the kinds 
of energy (from both the renewable as well as the conventional resources), in the period until 2020. These 
calculations have taken into consideration even the expected effects of the measures for energy efficiency 
and saving which will be introduced over the period. Under the title “reference scenario”, a scenario has 
been introduced taking into consideration only the measures of the efficiency of energy and savings. It is 
very important to emphasize the fact that as it was mentioned above, these savings have been almost 
inconsiderable, as the RENAP was passed officially in September 2011. Under the title “Additional 
Scenario for Energy Efficiency”, a scenario has been introduced taking into consideration all the 
measures that will be undertaken in order to achieve the RENAP objective of 9% in 2018. Pursuant to 
article 5 (6) of the Directive 2009/28/EC, with the intention to measure the compatibility with the 
indicative objective 2020 and the temporary trajectory, the amount of energy consumed in aviation must 
be considered not to be higher than 6,18% of the general consumption of the Contractual Party energy. 
Energy consumption in aviation for Albania during 2009 and 2010 was 0.97% and 1.07% respectively of 
the general consumption of final gross energy. Therefore, there is no need for regulation as these values 
are lower than 6.18% (in continuation table 1). [9]

2 Energy gross consumption is taken from the internal gross production of energy, including autoproduction, plus the import, minus the export..
3 Consumption in transport is provided for in Article 3(4)a) of the Directive 2009/28/EC. Energy from RERs in road transport for this parametre shall be multiplied with the factor 2,5 as it is described in Article 3(4)c) 
of the Directive 2009/28/EC
4 According to the provision in Article (2)f of the Directive 2009/28/EC. It inscludes the final consumption of energy plus the losses in the network and the use of heat for internal needs and energy in energy and heat 
production plants.

2. NREAP-THE FULFILLMENTS OF THE OBJECTIVES ON RES
2.1 Summary of the policy for renewable energy in Albania 
In the recent years, the Albanian Government has been trying to improve the legal and the 
regulatory framework for energy. In this direction, it made several attempts to change the 
existing laws and to encourage a competing climate for energy productions in general and the 
RES in particular. Along with a series of legal improvements, four key laws have been passed: 
the law for concessions, for energy sector (passed by the Parliament of Albania in May 2015), for 
renewable energy (passed by the Parliament of Albania in May 2015, but is being reviewed and is 
going to be ready for approval at the end of 2015), for the efficiency of energy in the buildings 
(the draft law was passed the previous year. It was prepared in line with the EU Directive). The 
purpose of these laws is the liberalization of energy market, competition increase, 
encouragement of renewable resources development and the attraction of the foreign 
investments in energy sector and ensuring a sustainable reform in the field of energy. With 
regard to the development of the projects for renewable energy, the licensing process has been 
improved. The establishment of one-stop-shop office for the licenses is a big step ahead made by 
the Albanian Government from 2009. However, with regard to its functioning, it needs further 
improvements. 
2.2 Indicating objectives for renewable energy
Pursuant to article 4 (1) of the Directive 2009/28/EC, the Contractual Parties in the EC Treaty 
were asked to have the following indicating objectives with regard to the part of the energy with 
renewable resources in 2020: 
 Heating and cooling; 
 Energy, and 
 Transport. 
The calculation of specific objectives of these three sectors converted in the predicts energy 
values (ktoe) must be at least as big as the energy amount expected from renewable resources 
which correspond with the general objective of RES for Albania in 2020, as it is reported in the 
final cell of the table 6b). Furthermore, the specific objective for transport shall be in compliance 
with the requests of article 3 (4) of the Directive 2009/28/EC for a level of 10% of the part 
covered by renewable energies in transport sector. From oil products, only diesel and diesel fuel 
are calculated for the nominator. This means that “Jet” fuel used in aviation as well as the fuel 
used for the ships is not calculated. Biofuels from the rubbish, the waste, cellulose non-food 
material and the lignocellulose material are calculated double regarding the nominator; General 
National Objective for energy from renewable resources in the final energy gross production in 
2009 and 2020 (data taken from Appendix 1, Part A of Directive 2009/28/EC) has been 
presented in Table 2.

3. MEASURES FOR THE FULFILMENT OF SPECIFIC
OBJECTIVES IN EACH SECTOR
3.1 Summary of the policies and of the measures for the enhancement to use 
energy from renewable resources
Albania has undertaken a series of steps for the inclusion of in its policies for energy, the 
requests of the EU Directives about the common rules for the creation and the 
development of internal energy market and the enhancement of production and energy 
consumption from renewable resources. In order for Albania to fulfill its international 
obligations and to achieve pursuant to the legal obligation the objective of 38% renewable 
energy in the final gross consumption until 2020, the country is undertaking a review of its 
supporting tools for renewable energy production. The scheme described in the following 
paragraphs will permit Albania to follow its objectives of RES and more concretely 
preserving and increasing the security in supply including a variety of RES generation 
technologies. 
3.1.1 Current supporting schemes for energy production from Renewable Resources .
At the moment there is a promoting tariff just for the small HPPs with installed power less 
than 15 MW and the tariff is calculated according to the average annual price of energy at 
Energy Stock market in Hungary (HUPX) determined in Euro cent/kWh x 1.24 x average 
exchange rate Euro/Lek for the previous year. This approach has been based on a simple 
formula and furthermore takes into consideration the price of energy import and connects 
it with the tariff to avoid the costs against the customer. The abovementioned formula, 
pursuant to the Decision of the Council of Ministers, shall be for 2015-2016 for the 
existing HPPs. 
The new system of promoting tariff shall be presented through the adaptation of the new 
law for RES, which is being prepared, taking into consideration that the level of the tariffs 
shall take into consideration the type the technology and the efficiency of the generating 
equipments. Also, the new law for RES shall offer other stimuli, such as: 
 The determination of a national objective for RES in the total of the final energy 
consumption; 
 The obligation of the transmission or distribution companies to connect new 
plants of RESin their networks; the payment only of the direct costs of the 
connection in the transmission networks and of energy distribution; 
 Recognition of the existing agreements for the purchase of energy produced from
RESand the obligation of the Operator to buy energy produces from small HPPs. 
As a result of these measures the interest on renewable resources has increase considerably,
particularly on small hydropower stations as the “most” traditional technology that is best 
known. 
The thermal system of solar panels for hot water preparation has gone through a 
considerable development. The current law provides facilitating measures in the tax system 
for these panels. [14]
3.1.2 Supporting promoting schemes of RES in energy market.
The state support is intended to be restructured for renewable energies and to replace the 
scheme of the feed-in tariff with a system based on Contracts for the difference (CfD). 
Anyway, in the legislation that is being amended, the feed-in tariff scheme is expected to 
remain into force to support the renewable energy in a small scale up to the capacity 2 MW 
installed for generating units. 
The renewable energy producers, at the moment with energy-purchase agreements 
finalized before the law which is being amended will enter into force, will have a fixed 
feed-in tariff for the remaining part of the contact. This situation does not exclude the 
right of these producers to move to a Supporting Scheme Contract for Difference. 
Based upon law 43/2015 “On energy sector”, the new model of energy market is being 
drafted, providing for the trading of energy from the renewable sources, to the advanced 
market when the Albanian Energy Stock market is established. 
The legal criteria of RES generation shall be established by ERE. Only the generation that 
fulfils the legal conditions might be supported pursuant to a CfD. The renewable 
technologies that will be acceptable for support according to the scheme CfD are listed in 
the following paragraph: 
- Biomass transformation
- Wind in terrestrial boundaries
- Solar photovoltaics 
- Hydroenergy 
- Energy from the waste through CHP
- Gas from landfills 
- Gas from the dirty urban water sanitation 
The Ministry shall review the list every year and might propose a change to the list at the 
Council of Ministers in case another technology is considered consolidated. 
Also, the legal changes will provide for the drafting of the Methodologies for the 
determination of standard prices which will be calculated in such a way that they will 
support the production of considerable renewable energy, economically acceptable from 
the market. 
3.2 Supporting schemes for the promotion of energy use from renewable 
resources of heating and cooling (RER-H&C).
The government is being planned to introduce some supporting schemes for the use of 
renewable energies for heating and cooling. The government is reviewing the law on RES
to add a provision that would finance the projects for heating and cooling, which use 
mainly biomass in the sector of agriculture. The financing is expected to be made through 
the grants from the RESfund set up by the government. The grants will reach up to 30% 
of the total cost of project investment. Ministry of Energy and Industry in corporation 
with the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Water Administration will 
identify the most suitable projects based on their financial realization and the influence to 
fulfill the objective of RESin the sector of agriculture. 
 [15]
3.3 Supporting schemes for the promotion of the use of energy from renewable 
resources in transport (RER-T)
Law no. 9876, dated 14.2.2008 “On the use, transportation and trading of bio-fuels and 
other renewable combustibles for transport”, article 8 (4), provides that from 2010, the 
minimal annual amount of bio-fuels and other renewable combustibles which are used for 
transport shall not be less than 3% of the total of the combustibles traded in the market, 
meanwhile from 2015-ongoing, it won’t be less than 10%. 
The new draft law on biofuels will have the same objective of 10% to comply with the EU 
Directive 2009/28/EC. The legislation does not contain any specific objectives about the 
different kinds of technology. 
Based upon point 2 article 8 law no. 9876, dated 14.2.2008 “On the production, transport 
and trading of biofuels and other renewable combustibles for transport”, the Council of 
Ministers, with the proposal of the minister in charge of the transport sector and the 
minister in charge for the sector of hydrocarbon/energy determines the minimal annual 
amount of bio-fuels and other renewable combustibles that shall be used in the following 
year in transport. However, this determination has not been made by any ministers from 
the moment the law entered into force. 
The obligation mentioned above has been determined for the whole companies of fuel 
products, which have a trading license. 
The law does not provide for sanctions or punishing measures for non-accomplishing the 
objective. However, the people who go through this obligation, licensed by the Ministry of 
Energy and Industry might be punished by this institution for noncompliance with the 
requirements of the primary and secondary legislation into force which regulates the 
activities for renewable combustibles used for transport purposes. 
Furthermore, the same law provides for fining for the retail tradesmen of fuel products 
who do not publish in a visible place in the places/points where they sell a note that 
indicates bio-fuels of other renewable combustibles as well as oil or diesel, mixed with biodieseline and bio-ethanol in the measure of 5%. 
No mechanism has been established for the supervision of the accomplishment of the 
objective. Ehen though the law for bio-fuels does not express this, the Technical and 
Industrial State Inspectorate, which is responsible for market surveillance of oil products, 
has the authority to supervise the accomplishment of the objectives provided for by law. 
Financial support might be classified in different ways. Such examples are: financial 
support for investment, capital grants, loans with low interest, the exclusion from the taxes 
or their reduction, tax reimbursement, tendering schemes, obligations for renewable tariffs 
with or without green certificates (tradable green certificates), promoting tariffs (feed in), 
promoting rewards, voluntary schemes. 
Financial support for bio-fuels used for transport is provided through the exclusion from 
the taxes. Pursuant to article 10 of law on bio fuels, from the period when the law enters 
into force and until 2018, the excise tax for these products will be zero. [16]
Apart from this, the law has another exception which was into force in 2012, the exclusion 
from the customs taxes and the VAT for all the machineries and the necessary equipments 
and the parts of the used objects for the production of bio-fuels and other renewable 
combustibles, include, but are not limited only with: 
- The equipments and the machineries which changer the organic fertilizer into 
organic improver of the soil, which might be used for the cultivation of the plants 
for energy purpose; 
- The equipments, materials and the agricultural machineries which will be used by 
the local farmers for plant cultivation for energy purposes; 
- The equipments and the main and assistant technological machineries of the biofuel production plants and of the other renewable combustibles are excluded from 
the customs taxes and from the VAT for the first period until the end of 2012. 
The executive bodies of this scheme are the Ministry of Energy and Industry and the 
Ministry of Finances along with the General Directorate of Taxes and the General 
Customs Directorate. 
No assessment has been made about the expected influences related to energy production. 
However, last year a plant was implemented for bio-fuel production in the industrial area 
of Porto Romano in Durres with the production capacity of about 100 000 ton per year. 
The tax decrease is not conditioned from any criteria about energy efficiency. 
This is a supportive measure implemented since 2008. The legal basis of this measure is 
law no. 9876, dated 14.2.2008 “On the production, transportation and the trading of biofuels and other renewable combustibles for transport”. The supporting scheme has been 
functional since 2008. 
The starting date of exclusion from the taxes (VAT and the customs taxes) for the 
equipments and the farmers’ machineries which produce the raw material for bio-fuel 
production and which are used for the construction of bio-fuel production plant was 14th
March 2008, meanwhile the last date was 31st December 2012. 
The starting date from the excise exception regarding the produced bio-fuels was 14th
March 2008, meanwhile the last date is 31st December 2018. No maximal or minimal 
system measurement has been determined for the producers of bio-fuels who benefit from 
the tax exclusion as it is provided for by law. At the moment, only one supporting measure 
is applied in Albania for the producers of bio-fuels: the one of the exclusion from the 
taxes. No local or regional scheme is applied for bio-fuels in Albania. 
The scheme offers the tax exclusion (VAT and the customs taxes) for the machineries and 
the equipments which are used for the construction of a plant for bio-fuel production. 
Anybody benefits from this scheme as long as he receives a permission for the 
construction of a plant for bio-fuels production. The scheme does not include 
specifications related to the technology implemented for bio-fuels production to benefit 
from this scheme. VAT is reimbursed pursuant to the procedures provided for in law for 
VAT, meanwhile that the exclusion from the customs taxes is applied in the moment the 
machineries and the equipments enter the Albanian boundary. As it was mentioned above, 
even though the law stipulates that the Council of Ministers after the joint proposal for 
energy and the minister in charge of transport, determines the minimal objective [17]
(percentage) of bio-fuels which will be used within e year in the sector of transport, no 
such an obligation has been determined. As it was mentioned above, the law does not 
make distinctions about the support based on the fuel and technology types. No specific 
support for bio-fuels, which fulfill the criteria of article 21 (2) of the Directive 
2009/28/EC, has been provided. 
 
3.3.1 Specific measures for the promotion of the exploitation of energy from 
biomass
In many Member States, energy source of biomass plays a crucial role as primary energy to 
cover the energy needs in the three sectors: heating and cooling, energy and transport. 
National strategy for biomass prepared in several Member States, is essential to plan the 
role and the interlinking of the uses among the terminal use of energy and the 
interconnection with the other non-energy sectors. For this reason, even Albania has 
assessed the domestic potential of biomass to use it with more efficiency in different 
sectors. The supportive measures will be provided with the review of Law on RES. 
3.3.1.1.1 Supply with biomass: domestically and abroad
Biomass is one of the most implemented sources of energy in Albania – mainly in the form 
of firewood, combined in some cases with shrubs and waste of the plans from the 
agricultural sector. The consumption of firewood has decreased at about three up to four 
times more during the period 1990-2002. After this year, firewood consumption has 
increased a little in the last years, as the result of the increase of the prices of the other 
combustibles and energy. The processed wood combustibles – woodchips, pallets and 
briquettes – are not used a lot due to their high price and the underdeveloped supply 
system.
The remains which have fallen by the trees and the woods of poor quality are mainly used. 
The waste of biomass from agriculture is not used widely and usually it is destroyed right in 
the spot. The use of bio-gas is not developed, despite the available resources. It is 
important to consider that the majority of the heating equipments which are used – the 
stoves and the chimneys – are old and inefficient, with heat loss up to 40-50%. The heating 
through the radiators with high efficiency for the local systems is underdeveloped. The 
assessments of the updated energy strategy indicate a considerable potential for extraction 
and exploitation of biomass in Albania from forestry, agriculture and livestock (for bio-gas 
production).
Biomass might be used for the production of energy only in the cogenerating plants (CHPCombined Heat and Power), especially in the ones which function with sawdust by 
different wood processing industries. Its use in the energy centrals with condensation (it is 
considered as unfavourable from the environmental, economic and technical prospective. 
Base on table 6 in the following paragraph it is clear that the information about the 
available amounts of biomass is insufficient. Of course, the state authorities should make 
more attempts for the development and the implementation of an information system 
related to the sources of biomass, which serves to channel the information in the Natural 
Resources National Agency. [18]

3.3.2 Measures to increase biomass availability taking into consideration the 
other users of biomass (agriculture and other sectors based on the forests)
The role of biomass will increase very little in absolute terms, as it is shown above, but at 
the same time, its relative contribution will decrease. Measures have been predicted in two 
directions: 
 The slight decrease of biomass in the final energy consumption; 
 The slight decrease of the heating energy produced by biomass exploitation. 
The use of biomass has been stable during the last three years for the following reasons: 
 The slow introduction of improved installations used for the exploitation of 
biomass in heating;
 The increase of wood price; 
 The improved performance of energy in buildings. 
Apart from the above information, we are kindly asking you to describe the current 
agricultural land situation used for energy production as follows: 
 The current use of the agricultural land for the production of agricultural energy 
cultures in 2009 (ha); 
 The use of agricultural land for the production of agricultural energy cultures, 
Surface
1. Land used for wood with a fast growing cycle (poplins, willows); For the period 
2006-2009 there is no HPPtare of land used for these purposes; 
2. Land used for other agricultural energy cultures, such as: grasses (Phalaris 
arundinacea, Panicum virgatum, Miscanthus), sorghum: based on the statistics published 
by INSTAT, there is no HPPtar of land used for these purposes. 
3.3.1.2 Mobilization of the new biomass resources 
According to the figures offered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and 
Water Administration (based on the annual publication in 2009), the degraded land surface 
is 12,335 ha. 
The unused agricultural land is assessed as approximately 34 568 ha. There is no planned 
measure for the increase of energy agricultural cultures but at the same time it is important 
to mention the fact that planting energy agricultural cultures is one of the mitigating 
measures for the gases with the greenhouse effect, which is mentioned in the Second 
National Communication of Albania addressed to the Framework Convention of United 
Nations on Climate Changes (FCUNCC) from 2009. Energy was not generated from the 
animals’ fertilizer and some preliminary feasibility studies have been carried out for the 
production of bio-gas from the fertilizer of different farms. There are no specific stimuli 
which promote the production and the use of bio-gas, apart from its use in the combined 
production of heat and energy, based on which the produced amount of energy is bought 
with preferential prices and Energy Regulatory Entity (ERE) should prepare the special 
fees for this technology. At the moment, the amount of biogas produced is zero; however, 
measures have been planned for getting the product in an amount of 7,1 ktoe biogas 
pursuant to the current document of RENAP. [21]
Attempts are being made to improve the management of forests in order to increase the 
development on the future and the sustainable reproduction. The certification of the 
communal forest and the state ones has been planned, to improve the techniques for their 
management. 
3.3.1.3 Influence on other schemes 
No assessment has been made for the influence of energy use from biomass in the other 
sectors. Such an assessment will be carried out in the future (a draft proposal has been 
drafted to study these effects. The draft proposal is still under the internal discussion 
through the national actors). 
The use of biofuel in the agriculture sector , 85% of energy consumption in agriculture in 
2009, was based on the liquid combustibles. So, the use of biofuels in this sector would 
facilitate its increase
(b) What kind of developments is expected in the other sectors which are based on 
agriculture and forestry, which would influence on energy production? (For example: 
Would the efficiency/the improved product increase or decrease the amount of subproducts at disposal for energy use?)
 
The increase of processed biomass production, for example, pallets, etc would cause a 
decrease in price for the final consumers. This thing would decrease the consumption of 
firewood and would decrease the loss of the companies which sell them.

National Environmental Agency (NEA) is an institution under the subordination of the Ministry of 
Environment, which is responsible for reviewing the environmental impact assessment process for 
projects under law no. 10 440, dated 7.7.2011 “On environmental impact assessment”, as amended, and 
for reviewing environmental permit applications. Further, this Agency is responsible for environmental 
monitoring.
In view of article 13 (1) of the Directive 2009/28/EC, the Albanian government has taken some
important steps. The new law on power sector (Law no.43/2015) in Article 49 (1) provides for that 
building of new generating capacity up to 2 MW, including renewable energy producers, is approved by 
the minister responsible for energy. On the other hand, the new law on renewable energy sources (Law
138/2013), in its Article 10 foresees that the Council of Ministers approves simplified procedures for
obtaining authorizations and licenses required for the production of energy from RER.
Article 37, paragraph 6 (b) of the law on energy sector also provides for that all producers, including the 
producers connected to the national grid with an installed capacity up to 1 MW, are not obliged to obtain 
a production license by ERE. The same law, in Article 39, paragraph 2, provides for that ERE may adopt
simplified licensing procedures for producers connected to the distribution network. Based on the above 
legislation, the Council of Ministers is expected to prepare and adopt specific procedures that will simplify
the issuance of construction permit necessary for RESproducers, while ERE will adopt a simplified 
procedure for the licensing of small producers of electricity, including RESproducers directly connected
to the distribution network.
Currently it appears that there is no unnecessary obstacle or inappropriate claims regarding authorization, 
certification and licensing procedures applied to plants and associated transmission and distribution 
infrastructure. Furthermore, the RESlaw contains provisions that exclude small producers of energy, with 
installed capacity up to 1 MW, from the obligation to obtain the production license. On the other hand, 
the creation of the National Licensing Center, according to Law no. 10081 dated 23.02.2009 "On licenses, 
authorizations and permits in the Republic of Albania", as amended, has significantly facilitated the 
process of obtaining a license, permit or authorization.
Authorizations for the construction of installations of renewable energy are granted by the Council of 
Ministers or by the requirements of the law on concessions for hydropower plants, or as required by law 
for the energy sector to other types of producers of electricity using renewable energy, or the law on biofuels for bio-fuel producers.
Licenses for the implementation of the activity of power production from renewable energy resources are 
issued by the Energy Regulatory Entity.Any project which envisages the power generation from RESor for any producer of bio-fuels is required 
to perform the procedure of preliminary or in-depth Environmental Impact Assessment (depending on 
the project), and then if the installation is listed in Annex 1 the law in force for environmental permits, 
and should be supplied with an environmental Permit of type A, B or C. Environmental protection law 
and the law on environmental impact assessment require the Ministry of Environment and its subordinate 
institutions and local authorities to cooperate throughout the process, ensuring public participation in any 
potential decision making process.
As regards the construction permits, according to the new law on territorial planning (Law no. 107/2014
and DCM no. 408, dated 13.05.2015), the local authorities are responsible for granting permission for
construction of any power plant. On the other hand, for each installation of photovoltaic or NUED
systems in buildings that are not considered as part of cultural heritage, require only a preliminary notice
of the local authorities (the Mayor). An important improved measure presented by the new legislation on 
territorial planning is to create a one-stop office ("One stop shop") for each building permit. This
measure will reduce the time required for obtaining a construction permit within a period not to exceed
60 days, and will increase the transparency of the process.
Concessions for the construction of hydropower plants are awarded through an open and competitive
bidding process, where bidders are provided equal access to information and data relating to the project. 
The information and data for a specific concession are also made available in the official website of MEI.
Conditions and criteria for granting a permit for the construction of a plant with renewable resources, 
other than hydropower plant, are already foreseen in the new law for the energy sector (Law no. 43/2015, 
dated 30.04.2015) and the specific Regulation approved by the Council of Ministers (DCM no. 1701, 
dated 17.12.2008).
Licenses for the production of electricity from renewable resources, transmission and distribution are 
granted based on the criteria established by law for the energy sector and licensing procedures approved 
by ERE, which are published in the Official Journal and in ERE official website. Interested parties 
wishing to carry out an activity in the energy sector can contact also directly with ERE technical staff, 
which is responsible for licensing, and to receive information on the procedures, requirements and 
documents to be submitted for obtaining a license.
The Albanian government has made a number of efforts to facilitate coordination between different 
administrative bodies responsible for different parts of the permit for a specific project. Establishment of 
the National Licensing Center has been a positive step forward in creating a "one-stop shop" service for
all licenses and permits required for a project.
However, according to the legislation in force for the construction of a new plant or new transmission or 
distribution infrastructure, a series of main authorizations/permits/licenses are approved or other
approving acts, including:
- decision of the National Environmental Agency for the preliminary environmental impact 
assessment (EIA) or the Minister’s Declaration for the in-depth EIA as per the stipulations of 
Law no. 10440, dated 7.7.2011 “On environmental impact assessment”, as amended;
- concession or authorization approved by the Council of Ministers or of the minister responsible 
for energy, in accordance with the law on concessions and law on power sector;
- activity license issued by the Energy Regulatory Entity.
As regards the time limits for application processing, it is hard to provide an average period for 
administering a case because it largely depends on the project. The major projects should often be 
subject to a spatial planning process that would require more time, partly due to the complex character of the project and involvement of local population during the reviewing process (process of approval of the 
environmental impact assessment).
It is worth stressing the fact that legislation provides for the implementation of the principle of 
acquiescence in case of the failure to reply of the administrative institution to a specific request, within a 
specific time limit provided for in the respective legislation.
As regards the EIA process, the legislation foresees some differences. Construction of small power plants 
with renewable energy, under the legislation in force, are initially subject only to preliminary EIA, and the 
National Environmental Agency is the one that based on its Decision, decides whether the proposed 
project should be subject or not to the in-depth EIA. Further, the plants with conventional energy 
undergo a more advanced EIA process. The authorization procedures of Albania take into account the 
specificities of different technologies of renewable energies, because they are governed by different 
legislations. As mentioned above, the authorizations for the new hydropower plants are granted in 
accordance with the law on concessions, which contains specific procedures and authorizations for other
REStechnologies are granted as required by law for the energy sector. Both legislations have different 
procedures, because while concessions are awarded on the basis of a competitive bidding process, 
authorizations for other renewable energy technologies are granted on the basis of the principle "first in 
time, first in rights".
Regarding construction permits, the legislation makes no distinction between renewable energy 
technologies and other conventional technologies.
Currently, there are no specific procedures in Albania for small decentralized RESinstallations. Both laws, 
the one for the power sector and on renewable energy, lay down provisions requiring the Council of 
Ministers and ERE to adopt procedures and simpler requirements for providing licenses and permits to 
producers of eligible RESand small producers.
Tariffs for the authorization of new RESplants are published in the Official Journal and in MEI website
together with the relevant government decision containing the criteria and procedures for reviewing and 
granting authorizations.
Royalties set by ERE for production licenses are published in the Official Journal and in ERE website 
together with the regulation on licensing procedures. After the start of production activity, the licensees
will be subject to a regulatory fee set by ERE based on their annual turnover, however, these fees are 
public and are applied proportionally to all licensed companies.
Fees for environmental permits are published in the Official Journal and are and published in the website 
of the MoE.
Concession fees for the hydropower plants are the result of the bidding process, where bidders offer 
concession fee based on a percentage of annual output they foresee, which is one of the bid evaluation 
requirements.
There is no official guidance available to local administrative bodies of planning, design, construction and 
rehabilitation of industrial and residential areas to install equipment and systems using renewable energy 
resources for producing electricity, and for heating and cooling purposes.
The new law (Article 8) provides for that the Ministry responsible for energy and the agency authorized to 
be responsible for renewable energy resources, will need to ensure that information on support measures 
for installations should be available to all interested parties such as developers, sponsors, investors, 
financial institutions, builders, installers, architects and suppliers of energy equipment and systems for 
heating and cooling in accordance with the use of energy from renewable resourcesHowever, the law does not set out any deadline or specific procedure on the way how to provide this
information or instruction. Therefore, a specific remedy needs to be applied for this purpose in the near 
future, and the order of the minister responsible for energy should be approved.
On the other hand, the RESlaw (Article 28/1) provides for that the Council of Ministers shall issue a 
regulation to ensure that the public is made available information on the availability and environmental
benefits of all renewable energy resources for transport. Regulation will impose an obligation to specify at 
the sales points, where the percentages of bio-fuels mixed with crude oil derivatives, exceed the 
percentage of the volume defined by ERE.
3.4.2 Buildings
Law on RES provides for that the Council of Ministers will adopt policies and measures to increase the 
use of solar energy within buildings, including the obligation for different categories of buildings, whether 
new or existing, public or private ones, in order to install water heating systems with solar energy to 
produce hot sanitary or technological water and therefore to meet the objectives set for increasing the 
input of solar energy in the total energy consumption within the country. The same article requires the 
Council of Ministers, upon the approval of the Minister responsible for energy, to identify the economic 
sectors and categories of buildings, the minimum area or capacity of water heating system with solar 
energy, the technical requirements of water heating systems with solar energy that will be installed, as 
well as specific procedures and criteria to be followed in connection with the implementation and 
monitoring of this obligation by the responsible institutions.
Ministry responsible for the construction sector is the Ministry of Urban Development. However, energy 
issues in buildings are divided to some extent between the Ministry of Urban Development and the 
Ministry of Energy and Industry. It is worth noting that based on current legislation on urban planning 
and development, local authorities have a key role in the construction sector and they are responsible for 
issuing and monitoring construction permits.
The new law 124/2015 on energy efficiency attaches stronger role to the Agency responsible for energy 
efficiency regarding the energy performance in buildings, where the conformity of each objective 
mandatory for RESinstallation within buildings will be monitored in the framework of overall 
performance of the building.
RER law does not set out any deadline or schedule on this measure, however, a draft governmental
decision is already prepared, establishing a schedule for the mandatory installation of NUED systems in 
different categories of buildings. It is important that the adoption and implementation of this decision is 
in line with the new legislation on the energy performance of buildings (energy efficiency legislation).
Another major revision of the existing legislation is the one proposed by the UNDP Program on Climate
Changes for the establishment and strengthening of the market of solar panels for hot water, and for 
revision of Law no.10112, dated 9.4.2009 "On administration of co-ownership in residential buildings. " 
Based on the proposed revisions, NUED system installations must be included in the joint ownership of 
apartment buildings enabling a better functioning and management of these systems.
According to UNDP Program on Climate Changes for creating and strengthening of market solar panels
for hot water, a proposal is made by virtue of a decision of the municipal council of Tirana for installation
within minimum surfaces of NUED into different categories of buildings, including buildings with 
households, apartment blocks, private offices, hotels and restaurants, sports facilities.According to the draft decision, this NUED system will have a surface area to meet at least 60% of the 
demand for hot water, apart from the open-door swimming pools that should fully heat water from solar 
thermal energy systems.
Currently, there is no minimum level for the use of renewable energy in building regulations and codes. 
As mentioned above, the new law on renewable energies requires the Council of Ministers to set 
minimum targets for the production of sanitary and technological hot water with solar energy in 
buildings, and mandatory installation of NUED systems for a category of buildings. Meanwhile, a
governmental draft decision is prepared on mandatory installation of NUED systems within buildings. 
The draft-decision also contains minimum NUED area that must be installed to meet the building 
demand for hot water. According to the draft decision, this NUED system will have an area to meet at 
least 60% of the demand for hot water, apart from the addition that will have to heat water completely by 
solar thermal energy systems.
The national policy has not taken into account any obligations for the minimum levels of renewable 
energy at the new and recently refurbished buildings. Based on the requirements of the new law on 
renewable energies, these minimum levels should be taken into account in these policies.
3.4.3 Informative provisions
Current and future information, as well as awareness campaigns and programs together with planned 
revisions and expected results should be described. Member States should also indicate which responsible 
authority will monitor and review the effects of the programs. When regional authorities / governments 
have a key role, please specify and summarize.
According to Article 8 of the law on renewable energies, the Ministry responsible for energy and the 
authorized agency being responsible for renewable energy resources (NANR) ensures that all 
stakeholders, such as customers, developers, planners, sponsors, investors, financial institutions, builders, 
installers, architects and suppliers of equipment and heating and cooling systems, electrical power 
equipment and other devices that use renewable energy, are made available information on support 
measures for plants that use renewable energy resources.
The same article (paragraph 2) provides for that the Ministry responsible for energy or agency responsible 
for renewable energy should develop appropriate programs for training or guidance on public awareness 
and information, in order to inform the interested parties and citizens about the benefits, costs and 
realization of the development and use of energy from renewable sources.
Ministry responsible for energy or subordinate institutions have not provided detailed rules or procedures 
on the way how to provide this information or awareness. However, it should be noted that a series of 
awareness campaigns have been launched by energy institutions in Albania to promote the use of RESin 
Albania, through various seminars, advertising in mass media etc. Ministry responsible for energy, 
together with its subordinate agencies, have organized a number of promotional activities that private 
investors invest in small power products with very good results. In recent years, a large number of private 
investors have shown keen interest to invest in electricity produced from water and wind.
There is still no plan of measures to promote the use of RESat a local level. The new territorial reforms, 
which will enable the creation of large municipalities expected to emerge after local elections of June 
2015, can be a key opportunity to enhance the role of local authorities for the implementation of
RESpolicies.Currently, there are no bodies responsible for providing information on the use of renewable energies in 
the heating and cooling sector and transport sector. As mentioned above, the new law on renewable 
energy (Article 25), the Council of Ministers issues a regulation to ensure that public is given information 
on the ownership and environmental benefits from all different sources of renewable energy for 
transport. Regulation should also foresee the obligation to specify at the sales points when the content of 
bio-fuels diluted in oil byproducts exceed the limit set in percentage, according to the stipulations made 
by ERE.
As mentioned above, the new draft on renewable energies requires, with regard to information on 
support measures for the use of renewable resources for electricity, the government has made available 
this information to investors not only through legislation published in the Official Journal or various 
websites, but also through a series of public events such as conferences, seminars etc.
The government aims to transform the agency responsible for renewable energies into an information 
center for all stakeholders regarding support measures for the use of renewable energies.
Currently, no institution or agency is responsible for developing and providing guidance for planners and 
architects to help them to take into due account the optimal combination of renewable energy resources, 
high-efficiency technologies, as well as central heating and cooling when planning, designing, building and 
refurbishing industrial or residential areas.
The Albanian government is preparing new legislation on energy efficiency and energy performance of 
buildings, including specific provisions for the optimal combination of renewable energy resources and 
high-efficiency technologies in planning, designing, building and refurbishing industrial or residential 
areas.
Information, awareness and training programs on the benefits and practices of using renewable energies 
to date have not been properly organized. Institutions responsible for energy policy, mainly for the 
support of international donors, have launched a series of information and awareness campaigns, but with 
little results. The only area where these programs have had satisfactory results are programs for the 
promotion of small power producers. A great interest is recently shown by the Ministry responsible for 
energy and the National Agency of Natural Resources to promote solar panel systems for hot water at 
local level.
3.4.4 Electricity infrastructure development
In addition to the existing situation and future actions of the current legislation, a description should be 
made of the planned revisions, relevant responsible bodies and expected results.
The existing domestic legislation includes as follows:
 Law no.43/2015, dated 30.04.2015 “On energy sector”;
 Law no.138/2013, dated 2.05.2013 “On renewable energy resources”
 Transmission Code
 Distribution Code
 Measurement Code
 Market Rules
 Law no. 107, dated 31.07.2014 “On territorial planning and development”, as amended
 Law no. 91/2013 “On environmental strategic assessment”
 Law no.10440, dated 07.07.2011 “On environmental impact assessment”, as amended
 Law no. 10448, dated 14.07.2011 “On environmental permits”, as amended Other secondary legislation approved in conformity with law.
According to the law on energy sector (Article 60), the Transmission System Operator, in consultation 
with interested stakeholders, draws up a ten-year plan on network developments and submits it for 
approval to ERE. Network development plan should take into account existing and scheduled demand 
for electricity; urban and regional planning of the area where transmission installations are extended; 
investment plans for regional networks and legislation on environmental protection, in particular the 
requirements of applicable law on environmental strategic assessment.
Also, the Transmission Code (Chapter 2, 3 and 4), Transmission Operator System (TSO) is, inter alia, 
responsible for the operation, development and expansion of the transmission network, as well as for the 
management of any transit of electricity between foreign systems using Albanian grid. According to 
Article III.5.1 of the Transmission Code, TSO is required to produce a Perspective Plan that covers a 
period of 15 years for the development of transmission system, taking into account the forecasts for 
electricity demand, peak capacity, additional capacities for electricity, transmission capacities, losses and 
other important parameters of SEE.
On the other hand, the Distribution Code (article II.4) requires the Distribution System Operator (DSO) 
to prepare a development plan for the distribution system based on the study of the future development 
of electric grid for an average period of 5 years and maximum 10 year term.
Both the transmission and distribution code will be revised to be in line with the provisions of law for the 
energy sector.
It is clear that any development plan must take into account the National Energy Strategy, updated for 
the development of energy resources, including the production of electricity from renewable sources.
Currently, TSO has in place not a too modern system of information measurement and collection. 
However, in recent years TSO realized a new dispatch center, together with a more advanced SCADA 
system that will enable TSO to gather real-time information from all producers of electricity and 
transformation points.
The new energy law (Article 78) requires that intelligent metering systems of end users can be installed in 
the power supply market. Implementation of intelligent metering systems will undergo a preliminary 
economic assessment, which must take into account all long-term future costs and benefits of the market 
and clients, including also the form of intelligent metering to be selected , which must be economically 
more effective and with more appropriate time limit for applying in practice such metering system. DSO 
will perform an economic assessment and prepare a schedule with the aim of installing intelligent 
metering systems within a period of 10 years.
Albanian operator of the transmission system has already completed a new 400 kV interconnection line
with Montenegro (Tirana 2 - Podgorica), which increased the capacity of the Albanian system 
interconnection up to 1000 MW.
Currently, OST is working to build a new 400 kV line with Kosovo (Tirana 2 - Pristina), which is 
expected to be completed in 2016.
In addition, a Memorandum of Understanding is signed between the Albanian and Macedonian 
transmission system operators for the construction of a new 400 kV line (Elbasan-Bitola). The project is 
expected to be financed by German KfW bank.Private investors have also shown interest to build an underwater cable system linking Albania to Italy. All 
these interconnections are increasing and strengthening the interconnection capacity of Albania with 
other neighboring states, which will largely facilitate the potential development of a regional market, 
where power plants with RESare expected to play a key role, considering the substantial resources in 
Albania and in other regional countries.
According to article 31 of Law no. 40/2015, dated 30.04.2015 "On power sector" authorization for 
construction of new interconnection lines, whether funded by the TSO or by private persons, should be 
approved by the Council of Ministers.
Furthermore, construction permits for network infrastructure are granted to companies that have a 
license for the transmission and/or distribution of power. According to Law no. 107/2014 dated 
31.07.2014 "On territorial planning and development” and DCM no. 408, dated 13.05.2015 "On approval 
of the regulation on territorial development", every construction permit for energy infrastructure will be 
granted by the National Territory Council.
Projects for building new infrastructure facilities for electricity are required to undergo the procedure of 
Environmental Impact Assessment according to provisions of applicable legislation in this area.
The main problems that transmission and distribution companies face in the construction of a line are 
related to land ownership. These issues are not related to the cost of paying the compensation price in 
case of expropriation, instead they are linked with the fact that in many cases landowners do not possess 
the certificate of ownership, since most of the lands in remote areas are not registered with the 
Immovable Property Registration Office.
Procedures for transfer of land ownership, where the project is implemented, are followed in accordance 
with law 8361, dated 22.12.1999 "On expropriation and temporary usufruct of private property for public 
interest". For this purpose, the interested subject prepares the relevant file as required by law.
The file is sent to the Ministry of Energy and Industry (MEI), which designated the Special Committee on 
Expropriation to review the file. If the file is completed in accordance with the law, MEI sends a proposal 
for expropriation to the Council of Ministers, which decides in favor where it notes that expropriation is 
based on law.
Further, the applicant properly compensates the owners according to tariffs set by withdrawing the title 
of ownership (retrieved from the Immovable Property Chief Registrar Office) and an identity document 
and prepares documentation for registration of property in his/her name with IPRO.
Due to the difficulties of Albania in administrative spatial planning, there existed a more efficient 
coordination between grid infrastructure approval and other administrative procedures planning. 
However, specific regulations adopted by the ERE regarding the review and approval of investment plans 
of the licensees in the electricity sector provides that such plans must take into account any spatial 
planning to develop the institutions of central or local authorities.
Discipline and better planning of new constructions will facilitate the development and building of a new 
network infrastructure in the future.
According to Article 11 of the law on renewable energies, at the request of a producer and in accordance 
with ERE regulations, the network system operators realize the connection of the plant with its point in 
the network system at the best option possible regarding the distance and technical requirements of the 
plant, if the network system has no other more favorable connection point. In choosing the best and most appropriate network, the system operator must take into account technical limitations or technical 
efficiency of the point where connection will be realized.
The same article (paragraph 2) provides that network system operators, at the request of the manufacturer 
of highest priority, make the connection of the plant with its point in the system, at the best option 
possible for the manufacturer with priority from the location of the plant, meeting the technical 
requirements of the plant, if the network system has no other more favorable connection.
There are no such cases because the current legislation requires that before a concession or authorization
is granted for the construction of a new power generator from TSO or DSO, a connection point should 
be ensured to the transmission or distribution network.
According to the Power Sector Law (article 28) any costs of connection to the transmission and / or 
distribution network of a producer of electricity, including RES electricity producers, will be borne by the 
manufacturer. The connection procedures are defined by codes of transmission or distribution. Article 27 
of the law on energy sector provides for that each new connection will be based on the rules and 
procedures proposed by the licensee and approved by ERE, including the cost calculation methodology 
and standard agreement of network connectivity.
However, the new law on renewable sources (article 11) provides for that operators of network system 
must optimize, expand and improve the system for connection and transmission of electricity from new 
power plants that use renewable energy resources, in accordance with the National Action Plan for 
Renewable Energy, master-plans of network operators to expand network system or any official 
document in force. These plans for optimization, expansion and reconstruction of the network system, 
where appropriate, should include the capacities of interconnection, intelligent networks and 
accumulation capabilities, in order to ensure the operation of network operator, and adaption of further 
developments for the production of electricity from renewable energy resources.
The same article stipulates that network system operators should develop and publish standard rules for 
keeping and sharing costs of technical adaptations, such as network connections and strengthening of 
network, improvement of the operation of networks and rules for the non-discriminatory implementation 
of network codes required to integrate a new producer on the national grid. These rules should be based 
on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria taking into account all costs and benefits from 
the connection of producers to the network, as well as special circumstances of producers located in 
peripheral regions and in regions with low population density. Standard rules on cost maintenance and 
sharing will be approved by ERE.
Any expenses incurred by transmission and distribution system operators to improve relevant systems in 
order to enable the connection of new producers of electricity with RESare reflected in their rates of 
transmission and distribution approved by ERE, if the investment for these improvements is previously 
consented by ERE.
Costs incurred by electricity producers for connection to the grid will be borne by themselves. As 
mentioned above, the new law on renewable resources authorizes ERE to develop standard rules, 
including the allocation of costs between electricity producers and RES network operator. However, 
these specific rules are not yet developed and approved.
There are no such rules for costs associated with upgrading of the network. If an investment for 
connection of a new producer of electricity is done by the private investor, any connection to other 
manufactuRES who use this investment will be subject to a private agreement between the two manufactures. Specific rules for the cost allocation of connection to the grid, as required by law for 
renewable energies, would include provisions dealing with the connection of this producer to a 
connection of an existing plant, already included by the first manufacturer.
Currently, the connection of new producers with RES is done according to specific rules contained in the 
transmission and distribution code, but the primary legislation does not include any specific provision for 
this purpose. Renewable energy law (Article 11/3) provides for that, upon the request of producers 
seeking connection to the network systems, network system operators will give them full and necessary 
information, including
- A comprehensive and detailed assessment of the costs for physical connection to the network;
- Reasonable and accurate time limit for receiving and processing the request for grid connection;
- Reasonable time limit for any proposed grid connection.
- All these requirements will also be part of the relevant codes or other special regulations approved 
by ERE.
3.4.5 Grid operation 
The new law on energy sector (Article 29) provides for that operators of transmission and distribution 
system ensure access to the network for all clients and users of the system, on transparent and nondiscriminatory basis and at ERE approved and published tariffs. The same article foresees that producers 
who produce energy from renewable sources, have priority access to the grids.
The new law on renewable energies (article 11/7) provides for that transmission and distribution of 
electricity produced from renewable energy resources are guaranteed, except in emergency situations 
defined in the law on energy sector or in the transmission and distribution codes. In the course of the 
dispatch of power generation plants, the Transmission System Operator will attach priority to power
generation installations to the extent that allows safe operation of the national electricity system and based 
on transparent and non-discriminatory criteria.
Currently, all existing producers of electricity in Albania rely on hydropower, therefore no priority is 
attached to the generating installations. Furthermore, the transmission system operation is carried out by 
an independent operator of the transmission system that dispatches the producers based on market rules.
As for producers connected to the distribution network, existing legislation guarantees their access to the 
network, unless there is a security problem with the functioning of the network.
Constraints/interruptions of electricity from renewable sources are reported when the distribution system 
operator has been forced, due to technical reasons, to disconnect a remote area where it is and where the 
small hydropower manufacturer is connected. The Albanian government has prepared a purchase 
contract for small hydropower plants based on the principle "take or pay", which will guarantee that in 
the event of constraint/interruption by the network operator without a technical reason small producers 
of electricity will be compensated for the decreased product.
Energy Regulatory Entity (ERE) is the responsible institution for monitoring the application and 
implementation of the measures described above. This regulatory entity is also responsible for the 
adoption of secondary legislation on the operation of network.
All RESpower plants are integrated in the energy market. The energy market is designed in accordance 
with the Albanian market model adopted by DCM no. 338, dated 19.3.2008. This market model requires 
that all electricity of the distributed producer ( ) be purchased by the buyer at a regulated promotional fee 
approved by ERE. At the same time, ERE has approved a standard agreement for the purchase of electricity (EPA) for these SHPPs. However, the model also foresees that SHPPs sell their electricity in 
the market at market prices, if they prefer so.
Albania has adopted a new law on the energy sector (lawnNo.43 /2015, dated 30. 04.2015) and secondary 
legislation should be developed to implement this new law, including a new model of the market and new 
market rules. Considering that the new law abolishes the concept of Public Wholesale Supplier, a new 
entity is expected to be designated as a recipient of electricity produced from renewable energy plants.
On the other hand, power producers (IPPs), which do not meet the conditions to receive a promotional
fee of selling electricity to the receiver, can sell electricity to DSO at negotiable prices to cover the losses 
of distribution or to sell in their energy at the competitive domestic market or export it abroad by using 
the right of access to the transmission system.
All electricity producers are required to be licensed by ERE and be registered with the market operator, 
and to pay a financial guarantee. These requirements are the same for the participants in the market and 
no preferential treatment is afforded to RES producers of electricity.
The new law on power sector envisages that energy market should be consolidated in Albania, in order to 
further increase transparency and competition in the wholesale market. Day-ahead market will create 
more market opportunities for renewable energy plants, especially for those that are not eligible for a 
promotional fee.
Based on the transmission and distribution tariff methodologies, and according to market rules approved 
by ERE, transmission or distribution tariffs in the domestic market are paid as per the load and not by 
producers. There are no plans to introduce a distribution or transmission fee for electricity producers, 
including those with RES plants in the near future.
3.4.6 Development of regional heating and cooling infrastructure
The country has no long-distance heating or cooling infrastructure and no specific legislation for longdistance heating or cooling is approved or expected to be approved
3.4.7 Bio-fuels and other bio-liquids-sustainability criteria and cHPPking of 
compliance
The following part of the national action plan should explain the future strategy of the Contracting
Parties to meet sustainability criteria for bio-fuels and bio-liquids and cHPPk the compliance with the 
scheme.
In February 2008 Albania adopted a special law on bio-fuels and other renewable fuels for use in 
transport (law no. 9876, dated 14.02.2008). The purpose of this law is to promote the production and use 
of bio-fuels and other renewable fuels used for the replacement of oil byproducts in the transport sector, 
in order to contribute to the accomplishment of commitments established under Kyoto Protocol for
climate changes, as well as provide tools and promote renewable energy resources through the 
introduction and cultivation of crops for energy and environmental protection. The law transposes the
previous EU Directive2003/30/EC of 8 May 2003 on the promotion of bio-fuels or other renewable 
fuels used for transport. However, the current law has no special provision to define the sustainability 
criteria for bio-fuels and bio-liquids.
The Albanian government is in the process of development of a new law on bio-fuels to transpose the 
Directive 2009/28/EC.The new law is expected to contain a number of provisions on the sustainability criteria for bio-fuels and 
bio-liquids produced or traded in the Albanian market.
Law on bio-fuels has set specific objectives for the use of bio-fuels in the transport sector, and according 
to the new law on renewable sources, these objectives will be integrated into the overall objective of 
renewable energies in the total final consumption within the country. Every compliance with the 
objectives set by law for the consumption of bio-fuels and NREAP will be monitored by State Technical 
and Industrial Inspectorate, which is the successor of the former Central Technical Inspectorate.
According to the new law on renewable sources, the National Action Plan for Renewable Energies to be 
adopted by the Council of Ministers, will be monitored by the agency responsible for renewable energy 
resources, which is expected to have authority and powers to monitor compliance with targets set for all 
renewable resources, including bio-fuels.
While the current law on renewable sources has no special provisions for the sustainability criteria on biofuels and bio-liquids, the new draft law on bio-fuels will incorporate such criteria transposing the
Directive 2009/28/EC. At the same time, the new draft law on bio-fuels will require the responsible 
Agency for renewable sources that in cooperation with the respective authorities responsible for 
agriculture and forestry, it will monitor and cHPPk compliance of bio-fuel producers with the 
sustainability criteria defined by law.
National Agency for Natural Resources, which is responsible for renewable sources, as required by the 
revised law on renewable resources, will have responsibility for monitoring and cHPPking the compliance 
with sustainability criteria. This Agency is expected to be supported by responsible authorities for 
agriculture and forests based on the new law on administrative and territorial division.
Protected areas established in accordance with law no. 8906, dated 6.6.2002 "On protected areas" are 
managed by the relevant state authority set up by the Decision of Council of Ministers, depending on the 
type and nature of the protected area. The composition, duties, responsibilities and functioning of the 
administration of each category of protected area are approved by the Council of Ministers.
MoE, after approval by the Council of Ministers, can take over the management of protected areas, 
including its auspices of the respective administrative body for this administration.
ME defines the method of marking the protected areas on the ground and on the map. The emblem of 
the Republic of Albania will be used to mark the protected areas. ME informs the relevant geodesic and 
mapping bodies about the statements, changes or removal of the protected area status. Protected areas 
are registered with the central archiving system of the Ministry of Environment, which is created by using 
data of the relevant state institutions and other specialized institutions.
MM formulates and approves rules for establishment, operation and use of the central archiving system. 
The central archiving system of protected areas is open to the public and everyone can use it with 
permission and in the presence of an authorized official.
Law no. 8906, dated 6.6.2002 "On protected areas" provides special protection for some key components 
of nature and biodiversity. This law classifies protected areas into six categories, as follows:
a. strictly natural reserve/scientific reserves - Category I
b. national parks - Category II
c. natural monuments - Category III
d. managed nature reserve / area of management of habitats and species - Category IV
e. protected Landscape - Category Vf. protected area of managed resources - Category VI
The categorization of areas, status and level of protection for each area based on the criteria of the World 
Centre for Nature Conservation.
For each category, the legislation provides a certain level of protection. Categories of protected areas are 
defined in the Decision of the Council of Ministers for their recognition.
Article 4/3 of the Law also foresees that areas where natural habitat species of interest to the European 
Community, as well as other habitats of interest to this community, are declared areas of special 
conservation. These areas are part of the national ecological network and may include protected areas and 
ecosystems, habitats and landscapes outside the network. Minister responsible for the environment 
approves the list of Albanian areas of interest to the European Community.
The law provides that protected areas are declared land, water, marine and coastal areas designated for the 
protection of biodiversity, natural, cultural and social features managed by legal remedies and modern 
scientific methods.
Article 15 of the law stipulates that the Ministry of Environment, other state agencies and local 
government authorities or in cooperation with third parties, draw up for each protected area, 
management plans of this area. Management plans of protected areas will be included in policies, plans 
and programs related thereto, as well as in decision-making at the national, regional or local level.
Procedures for changing the status of agricultural land are provided by DCM no. 665, dated 28.07.2010 
"On the rules and procedures of change of categories of land resources" and DCM. no. 410, dated 
27.06.2012 "On establishment of rules and procedures of change of categories of land resources" 
including a number of requirements for each application associated with the land status change. The 
process involves a number of institutions, Regional Directorates of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture, 
Rural Development and Water Administration, Regional Forest Service and Ministry of Environment in 
cases of the change of forest land status.
The decision on the land status change is made by the Minister of Agriculture, Rural Development and 
Water Administration to change the status of agricultural land to forest land, pasture or meadow and 
through a joint decision of the Minister of Agriculture, Rural Development and Water Administration and 
the Minister of Environment to change the status of forest land, pasture or meadow to agricultural land.
The protection status of a protected area is removed or changed when the circumstances or objective for 
granting this status has changed. The status of a protected area is revoked by a Decision of Council of 
Ministers, with proposal of the Ministry of Environment, after receiving feedback from specialized 
institutions, local government authorities, non-profit organizations and owners when their properties are 
part of the protected area.
The proposal on revocation of the status of a protected area should include:
a) Justification for the status revocation ;
b) environmental impact assessment that reflects the impact on the existing categorization of the 
protected area, biodiversity and local communities or populations;
c) a description of mitigation measures;
d) the results of the coordination and consultation processes with stakeholders from civil society, 
especially with populations or communities within and around the protected area, including a summary of 
comments received and reflection on the proposal.
The legislation has not provided for any time limit to update the registry (cadastral) of land zoning, 
however the legislation requires that under the new territorial and administrative division, the Department 
of Land Administration and Protection should update cadastral documentation for the territory under their jurisdiction and they are also obliged to inform the local immovable property registration offices of 
any changes of land categories, which can be adopted according to the requirements and procedures of 
the applicable legislation.
The Albanian legislation generally requires that raw materials used in agriculture should meet the best 
agrarian-environmental practices. The use of raw materials in agriculture is regulated by Law no. 7659, 
dated 12.01.1993 "On seeds and saplings". The State Entity of Seeds and Saplings is set up for the 
purposes of quality control for the plant cultivation material and for conservation of genetic material. 
This institution is under the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Water Administration. The 
State Entity for Seeds and Saplings is the only governmental body responsible for licensing the 
importation or exportation of any kind of plant cultivation material.
3.5 Intended use of statistical transfers between Member States and planned 
participation in joint projects with other member states and third countries
This sub-chapter should describe the intended use of cooperation mechanisms between Member States 
and third countries like Albania. This information should be based on what is provided in the forecast 
document, referred to in Article 4 (3) of Directive 2009/28/EC.
3.5.1 Procedural aspects
Accurate, reliable and timely assessment of production capacities is essential for the country's ability to 
provide statistically "surplus production" for Member States, taking into account the mandatory 
percentage of renewable energies in energy consumption.
The establishment of national procedures requires the creation of an updated and well-coordinated 
register of gross final energy consumption in all sectors of the economy and reliable tracking of the 
implementation of renewable energy projects. In the sector of electricity, gross production and 
consumption from renewable energy resources is determined on the basis of guarantees/certificate of 
origin. Currently in Albania there is still no market for warranties/certificates of origin (e.g. as part of the 
sales of energy green certificates (produced from renewable sources). Detailed promotions of the 
guarantee /certificate of origin under the new law on RESare set out in Articles 19, 20 and 21.
3.3.1.4 Certificate of origin warranty
ERE, at the request of a manufacturer that has been supplied by ERE with technical preliminary 
qualification for the plant with renewable energy under provisions of the regulation referred to in 
paragraph 10 of this Article, will issue a certificate of origin guarantee for electricity or heat produced by a 
generating plant. Guarantees of Origin will apply to the standard size of 1 MWh and will specify:
• energy resources from which electricity is produced, classified by type and key components, including 
the information to what extent the electricity was produced from renewable energy resources;
• exclusive percentage of biomass, in cases where biomass is used;
• name and address of the producer;
• location, capacity and date of commissioning of the plant;
• Period during which energy is produced and to what extent it is paid in accordance with Articles 15 and 
16 of this Law, and
• Place of issue and unique identification number.
ERE will supervise the issuance, transfer and cancellation of guarantees of origin in accordance with the 
provisions of the regulation issued under paragraph 9 of this article.Guarantees of origin are issued based on comprehensive data and correct information to certify the origin 
of electricity supplied by the manufacturer and certified measurement data from network system operator. 
Guarantees of origin are issued only if the producer provides all the information required under 
paragraph (2) of this Article.
Any use of the guarantee of origin is made within 12 months of production of the corresponding energy 
unit. The guarantee of origin is canceled after use.
If electricity is produced from a hydro power plant with a reversible pumping system, guarantees of origin 
will be issued only for the amount of energy corresponding to the difference between the electricity 
produced by hydropower plant and electricity consumed by the reversible pumping system.
If electricity is produced from biomass, guarantees of origin will be issued only for the percentage of 
energy corresponding to the bio-degradable share, as defined in paragraph 1 of Article 3 of this law.
Within a period of 12 months from the date of entry into force of this law, ERE will create an electronic 
register of guarantees of origin with a suitable mechanism for data processing to ensure that guarantees of 
origin are issued, transferred and canceled electronically and are accurate, reliable and not subject to fraud. 
Any interested party is entitled to freely have access to this register.
Within the same period referred to in paragraph 8 of this article, ERE will adopt a specific regulation for 
the procedure applied for guarantees of origin. The regulation foresees in particular:
Documents to be submitted by the Producer for technical qualification of its installation as a plant for 
generating electricity or heat from renewable energy resources.
Technical qualification procedure and in particular the timeframe within which ERE must respond to 
applications submitted, as well as the legal consequences due to failure to meet this obligation.
3.3.1.5 Monitoring procedure
Procedure applied to the issuance, registration, transfer or cancellation of guarantees of origin.
Issues related to cooperation with competent authorities of the EU Member States and other countries 
with which an agreement is signed for mutual recognition of guarantees of origin. ERE is responsible for 
changing the previous regulations on the procedure applied for guarantees of origin to reflect the 
provisions set out in paragraph 9 of this article
3.3.1.6 Monitoring procedure and prohibition of multiple sales
To ensure that the conditions for issuing the guarantees of origin are met and that data and information 
on which their issue is based are correct, ERE representatives and any person authorized by it, have a 
right of free access to the respective generation plant and to all data and information related thereto, 
without prejudice to the maintenance of business secrets. The producer is obliged to facilitate the work of 
ERE representatives and the persons authorized by it.
Electricity and heat produced from renewable energy resources, as well as landfill gas or gas from 
wastewater treatment disposed to the gas network cannot be sold or transferred more than once. As a 
result, the Producer is paid by promotional legal fees and will not be permitted to transfer or sell any 
guarantee of origin for electricity. If the Producer delegates this guarantee of origin for electricity from 
renewable energy resources, no feed-in tariff can be paid for electricity and the Producer may lose 
benefits from feed-in tariffs.3.3.1.7 International cooperation for origin guarantees
The guarantee of origin for electricity produced from renewable energy resources, which is issued by a 
state that is a Contracting Party or a Member State of a Contracting Party to the Energy Community 
Treaty, is also recognized in Albania.
The Council of Ministers or the Ministry responsible for energy may enter into agreements with one of 
EU member states or a contracting party to the Treaty of the Energy Community for Southeastern 
Europe for mutual recognition of guarantees of origin for the purposes of measuring compliance with the 
requirements of Article 4 of this law on general national objectives for renewable energy.
Guarantees of Origin issued/registered by ERE and this mechanism are sufficient to determine the 
production of renewable energy as part of the gross final consumption of electricity.
It is more difficult to determine the major contribution of biomass energy in the heating and cooling 
sector. Given the huge consumption of wood biomass for heating purposes, the estimation of the part of 
renewable energy resources in final energy consumption in this sector requires information on:
 total direct supply with wood biomass (from the managed forests);
 total direct supply of wood biomass from individual collection of villagers;
 total biomass supply from industrial waste (from the wood processing and furniture industry, 
sawmill units, paper and paper pulp processing industry, recycling of wood);
 total recycled / remained / regenerated biomass;
 assessment of the gross calorific value of alternative biomass 
 total biomass production from energy agricultural crops;
To this end, we need to ensure close cooperation between the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural 
Development and Water Administration, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Energy and Industry, 
Ministry of Public Works and Transport, National Agency of Natural Resources and Institute of Statistics 
(INSTAT).
Based on the above information, it can determine the total energy content of the total biomass 
production can be calculated compared to the corresponding total energy content of fuel used for 
heating. Despite the great variety of combustion technologies with high efficiency, it can be assumed that 
in a certain use, the total usable energy content of the biomass would be equal to that of ordinary fuels, 
i.e. bio-fuels directly replace the same amount of conventional energy.
ERE and the National Agency of Natural Resources will administer a national database for electricity, for 
all the statistical data related to energy resources as described above. Statistical guarantees of origin shall 
be issued for every 1 MWh (0.086 toe) produced from renewable energy resources in transport and 
heating, as well as for electricity produced from renewable energy resources. These origin warranties will 
be available for trading by EU member states.
The implementation of renewable energy projects can be combined with the implementation of energy 
efficiency measures based on NAPEE, already approved by the Albanian Government on September 9, 
2011. Given the national potential for implementing energy efficiency measures, a key criterion in the 
selection of fund-eligible projects will be the participation of enterprises making improvements in energy 
efficiency, for example, enterprises with high demand for energy, large buildings and energy traders. 
Another advantage would be the existence of an energy audit report to contain information about the 
economic advantages of energy efficiency measures, allowing an assessment whether these measures 
should be integrated or not to the measures for renewable energies.Contracts with guaranteed results, together with grant financing for additional measures from the state 
budget, private investors and the operational programs will constitute an appropriate mechanism.
Albania is ready to participate in joint projects with Member States. After the approval of law on RER, 
ERE shall prepare feed-in tariffs for cogeneration plants using biomass energy.
3.3.1.8 Calculated surplus of the production of renewable energies that may be transferred to 
other member states compared to the indicative trajectory
In the best scenario for the development of energy production from renewable sources, combined with a 
firm policy on energy efficiency, Albania has high potential for statistical transfers to other member states, 
especially based on the concept that only wind power plants (eolic parks/wind farms) with a capacity of 
100-120 MW would be needed to meet RESobjective. Wind potential is approximately 1500 MW, as it 
will be mentioned in the following section, and all the difference will be available for export purposes.
3.3.1.8.1 Potential calculated for joint projects
There are a number of options for the development of projects for the use of renewable energy in 
Albania. Production of electricity from renewable energy resources is strongly supported by the domestic 
legislation and a number of investors from the European Union. Several projects have already been 
completed, while others are ongoing. There are a number of opportunities for joint projects in this field 
within the range of up to 3000 MW of installed capacity (mainly hydropower, wind, biomass and solar 
energy).
However, economic conditions in Albania require a combination of policies to encourage the use of 
renewable energy policy promoting the production of heat, which is much more efficient in terms of 
primary energy use and requires less relative investment. Costs of supply and transformation would also 
be lower because production would be closer to the consumer. There are a number of options:
• a large-scale program to promote the use of solar panels for water heating, thus reducing energy use. It 
is worth noting that UNDP program on Climate Changes supported by FGM and the Albanian 
government is working for two years to promote this technology as one of the main uses of RESto cover 
the demand for hot water, coupled with the reduction of gases with greenhouse effect;
• combined burning of fossil fuels and biomass for central / regional heating in public buildings;
• expansion of the production of wood chips from wood waste use, with a view of replacing installations 
for the production of heat in industry and public services buildings.
• The Albanian Government is also implementing a project to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy 
resources for heating / water heating in public buildings. This project supported by KfW "Promotion of 
energy efficiency of renewable energy resources in Albania" is already implemented as a pilot project in 
three cases and is planning to invest around 5 million Euro in various public buildings. The fuel-operated 
current boilers can be completely replaced with plants using solid biomass, bio-gas or bio-fuels to meet 
energy demand for the heating of premises and solar collectors to cover hot water demand.
Yes, a proper technology for the heating of premises is based on the combustion of solid unprocessed 
biomass raw (e.g. wood chips and pallets) in boilers with installed capacity of 0.1 to 0.3 MW. The exact 
number of potential installations will be determined in the next two calendar years after the preparation 
of the register of hot water boilers in the Albanian territory, as required by the draft law on energy 
efficiency. The National Agency of Natural Resources will start the preparation of such a register within 
the next two years.
Most of the waste from agriculture, food processing industry and logging can be processed by being 
transformed in chips and wood briquettes. Currently, these opportunities are not used due to the high price of chips and the fairly low price of firewood widely used by families. According to estimates, about 
one third of apartments in Albania use wood biomass for heating, most of which is crude. This market is 
continuously expanding because families refuse to use the expensive services of central heating 
companies, which use mainly electricity and LPG.
Municipalities with their forests that have proper annual growth to supply the planned capacities, are 
suitable for the implementation of joint projects. Funding may be provided under contracts for 
guaranteed energy savings under operational programs and the European Union. Owners of forests or 
large farms and producers of biomass boilers are eligible participants for the construction of factories for 
the production of chips and wooden pallets.
Currently, Albania has no joint project with other member states regarding the promotion of biomass 
boilers with high energy efficiency. However, suitable technologies from Germany and Austria have just 
arrived in the Albanian market.ASSESSMENTS
3.6 Assessment of the available potential for the development of local renewable 
energy resources
3.6.1 Potential of hydropower plants (HPP)
It should be noted that in Albania there is still a high hydro-capacity for creating new power generation 
capacities to be built in the coming years. The following HPP-s are proposed to be considered as new 
capacities:
• About nine medium and large hydropower plants with total installed capacity of 385 MW, including 
HPP of Kalivac.
• On Devoll River: HPP of Banja with 65 MW and HPP of Moglicë with 178 MW 
• Medium and large HPPs with a total installed capacity of 480 MW
• ERE plants with total installed capacity of 30 MW
• Photovoltaic plants with total installed capacity of 32 MW
3.6.2 Concessions for SHPPs
Since 31 December 2014, the Albanian Government, based on the law "On concessions" (adopted in 
December 2006), has awarded up to about 120 concession contracts (110 have been already approved 
and 10 are in the final stage of discussion) for the construction of HPP-s of different categories. Annex I 
provides the total number of concessions, the relevant company, installed capacity, average annual 
production and respective investment for each concession contract. To have a clear picture of small 
medium and large hydropower plants, the total list of HPPs is divided into the following three categories:
1. One or cascade of SHPPs-with total capacity below 15 MW. Based on the definition of the Decision of 
the Council of Ministers (DCM), they are considered SHPP;
2. SHPP-cascade with a total capacity of over 15 MW: Based on the definition of the Decision of Council 
of Ministers (DCM), they as considered as SHPPs;
3. Medium and large HPP-s and cascade of hydropower plants with a capacity of over 15 MW each: 
Based on the definition of DCM, since each plant has a capacity of over 15 MW, they are not considered 
SHPPs;
The analysis shows that the largest number of concessions is related to the first and second group, with a 
total of 112 concession contracts included in the category of small hydropower plants. The total installed 
designed capacity is 1740 MW and the share of SHPP-s is about 48%, with an installed capacity of 839 
MW. The new planned capacity of energy constitutes a substantial capacity when compared with the 
current total installed capacity of hydropower plants in Albania (1426 MW). Also, the total planned 
capacity of SHPP’s of 839 MW is much higher compared to the installed capacity of the existing SHPP-s 
(25 MW) until 2006.
Comparison of estimated annual production of electricity with average annual production of electricity 
from existing hydroelectric plants in Albania (4180 GWh) shows that the total potential of electricity 
generation is 185% of current production from hydropower plants. The first group can provide 84% of 
the present average, while groups two and three can produce 45% and 55% of the current electricity 
production from hydropower plants.
Regarding the total investment for each of the aforementioned groups, the analysis shows that total
demand for investment is EUR 2 471 million and the share of investment required for small HPPs is about 785 million Euro. Both these values represent significant amounts for the Albanian economy in 
general and its banking sector in particular, making it a very attractive sector.
3.3.1.9 Operational SHPP: old rehabilitated units and new units
The total list of existing operational SHPPs and their production for the first half of 2014 is available
from MEI. In early 2015, the number of the existing operational SHPPs was approximately 90 compared 
to 18 in early 2006.
The total list of new operational SHPPs, their total capacity installed is equal to 294.32 MW and their 
production for 2014 (equal to 919 GWh).
3.3.1.10 SHPPs under construction
The number of concession contracts for small hydropower plants under construction is approximately 25
and 8 of them have secured loans, 15 are in the process of negotiation with banks.
3.7 Energy potential from biomass
The usable biomasses for energy purposes may be classified into four main categories: 
 Wood or its remnants from different wood processing industries;
 Plant residues (stalks, seeds etc) after the completion of their production cycle, which are not 
used in other production sectors;
 Energy-related agricultural crops (woods) cultivated to be burned as biomass and;
 Animal residues (bones, skin, manure), which are not used in other economy sectors.
Forests occupy about 36% of the land surface of Albania. Some afforested areas are included in 
calculations of the land covered with forests, where half of them are classified as groves and shrubs and 
the other half as forests with high stems/trunks. Almost 4/5 of woods are represented by broad-leaved 
species, with dominance of oak and permanently green beech trees.
Albania is one of the few European countries that has suffered a decrease in the area covered by forests 
in recent decades, due to cleaning for agriculture purposes, overgrazing and cutting of wood stuff for fuel, 
especially during the transition period (in around 1990s ). Cutting of trees has exceeded the annual net 
growth, which results in decrease of growing stock trees; there was also a decline in its quality as a result 
of illegal logging. Most of the forests are available for the supply of timber; the rest, which is the vast 
majority, is not available for economic reasons. More than 4/5 of forests are classified as semi-natural, 
while the rest is divided into forest without human intervention and plantations. The country developed a 
reforestation program to plant trees, mainly in a difficult terrain, but currently it is downgraded due to 
lack of investment in this field. All forests have been state-owned, but land ownership regime is changing 
categories, including private and community forests. Currently, 47% of the forest is owned by the 
municipalities, about 51% is owned by the state and around 2% is under private ownership. Efforts are 
being made to increase the area of protected forest to preserve the rich biodiversity and landscape. 
Protected areas comprise of more than 450 thousand HPPtares, and they will grow as a result of the 
commitments of the government.
From 2004 to 2012, the surface of Albanian protected areas Albanian has suffered a triple increase.
During the 1990s, and despite the fact that forest management was particularly influenced by the sudden 
collapse of the previous economy, the forestry sector was not adequately supported. However, the 
productive capacity of the sector has the potential to be restored, in order to play an important role in 
rural employment, industrial development and environmental protection.Contrary to its unique importance for the economy, the forestry sector continues to suffer from some 
typical problems of transition: declined investment, weakening of practical forest management, 
maintenance, lack of supervision and law enforcement. Therefore, the basis of resources has declined 
substantially for many years towards the end, not only in terms of quantitative aspects, but also for the 
large-scale degradation of forests. Growing of trees per HPPtare is significantly affected, and a large 
amount of mature timber can be nowadays found only in physically inaccessible parts of the country. At 
the same time, economic restructuring has caused a decline in the efficiency of wood cutting and 
processing, while illegal cutting have distorted market prices. Also, the local energy policies were not in 
favor of forests, negatively affecting forest degradation.
Forests all over Albania, especially in mountainous areas, serve as a source of livelihood and income. 
Firstly, the firewood gathered by villagers, not to mention most of the population in urban areas supplied 
with firewood, which are vital for heating and cooking almost all over the year. Firewood is an important 
commodity for Albania, because they are used for heating by most households, and in rural areas they are 
also used for cooking. They now cover 36% of energy demand for heating and 12% of energy for 
cooking. This means that firewood is still indispensable source of energy and will continue to be 
important. Larger groups of consumers of firewood are families, but public institutions, manufactuRES
of charcoal and limestone also consume large volumes of firewood.
One of the main problems of the forest sector is the lack of accurate data regarding stock of forests 
(increase, decrease of its surface area and volume etc.). Forest Cadastre continues to not reflect the real 
situation of national forests. On the other hand, there is no nationwide cadastral office to 
evidence/reflect the relevant changes of land use within the country. Forest area is one of the main forest 
indicators. Over the years, it has undergone some significant changes. It is decreased in absence of a data 
system due to the failure to draft management plans for many years, national inventory of forests and 
maintainance of the system database. For this purpose, an identification project with the support of 
World Bank is ongoing. Data presented in the figures below are based on information released by the 
Ministry of Environment.Figure 9: Annual forest area (HPPtares) for Albania (Source

Based on the data presented, it is clear that the current level of wood consumption as fuel used only for 
energy requires a higher annual growth of 35-55% than the annual increase of forests. Such a trend 
should change in order to allow sustainable development of this sector for the Albanian vital economy. In 
order to attain forest sustainable development, due account should be taken of the use of biomass as fuel 
to reduce consumption from 2011,50 ktoe (in 2013) to 167,79 ktoe (in 2020), and re-afforestation at the 
minimum threshold of at least 2200 HPPtares annually.

The use of biomass for energy generation in Albania can be obtained from the following sources (Table 
9):
• Agricultural waste (stems, seeds etc) after the end of their production cycle, which are not used in other 
production sectors;
• firewood or wood residues from different wood processing industries;
• Energy Plantations (fast growing grove) cultivated to be burned as biomass, and;
• The remains of animals (bones, skin, livestock manure) that are not used in other sectors of the 
economy;
• Waste (for instance, food and household waste).
Olive cultivation is an important industry for the coastal area of Albania. Olive oil extraction is the 
process of oil separation from other fruit content (vegetative liquid extract and solid material). Basic steps 
in producing olive oil are always the same and include: 1) cleaning the olives and removing the seeds, 
leaves, buds and other waste; 2) pressing of olives for making a paste and 3) separating the oil from the 
rest of the components of olive oil. Currently, three main methods are applied to extract olive oil: 
"traditional process", three-phase process and two-phase process.
Types of waste generated: olive mill technology produces a variety of waste, both solid and liquid. Solid 
waste produced from the extraction of olive oil are alperujo [Spanish] (i.e. pomace remained from the
two-phase system), and orujo [Spanish] (i.e. pomace remained from the three-phase system). Solid waste 
are also generated while pruning olive trees in the olive-grove. These include leaves and small branches 
(after pruning). The leaves can be used as animal feed, fertilizer or compost production, while small 
branches, pits and dried olive pomace can also be used for energy production. Liquid waste are known as 
oil mill sewage and in some cases are used as additives for making cosmetic products and also for bogaz 
as large amounts of non-collected oil and fine residues of pomace remain in the oil mill wastewater 
particles.
The potential uses of pomace are: (i) bio-energy production ; (ii) production of a low-quality oil as a food 
product, through a factory chemical process known as "olive pomace refineries"; (iii) spread in 
agricultural fields as fertilizers (or mixed with soil for the refilling process, for example in quarries); (iv) 
used as animal feed; and (v) destruction as waste. Energy production (the focus of this project), olive 
pomace is directly burned into boilers or transform into pallet or briquette for use in boilers and stoves. 
In both cases, oil-pomace must be firstly dried.
Rural areas present some features favoring the potential development of an energy chain with olive 
pomace because: a) agricultural sector is one of the most important economic activities in rural areas, 
which face serious difficulties. The unemployment rate is higher than the national average, especially 
among young people; b) the local community is provided additional economic activity. Community 
development based on bio industries often involves strengthening community support services, providing 
additional jobs in the local government bodies and service sectors; c) provides a green label for energy 
users differentiating it from other competitors; and d) mitigates rural depopulation. Document FGM / 
C.31/5 of FGM Council, together with the United Nations Organization for Industrial Development 
(UNIDO), have established at the Ministry of Environment the project on "use of olive pomace for 
energy purposes", with the aim of facilitating the direction for development with small amounts of carbon 
in agro-farming industry in Albania. Critical factors for the project success are the implementation of 
technical solutions adapted to local needs of four industrial sub-sectors in Albania, and the creation of a [54]
chain of domestic supply, so that piece of equipment are produced at effective cost, building of the 
system and costs compliant with the local economy, and the operation and maintenance to be timely and 
affordable. UNIDO experience working with industrial sector in general for small and medium 
enterprises in particular is important for achieving the objectives set out in this project. Moreover, upon 
the use of pomace as biomass, most of olive oil factories have planned to use a portion of the biomass 
(15-20%) for domestic needs and the rest (80-85%) will be transformed into briquettes / pallet and will 
be sold for residential buildings, private/public service buildings, as well as for small food processing
establishments by applying the latest renewable energy technologies.
Bio-gas use is underdeveloped despite the available resources, so the agricultural biomass from major 
plants will be subsequently calculated in detail, and the biomass to be collected by pruning the main fruit 
trees.

3.7.1 Solar energy potential
The study “Sun in Action”6 showed that there is a great potential for solar heating systems, not only for 
the EU area, but practically worldwide, including participating states in IEA countries. It was also shown 
that a number of obstacles must be challenged to develop the market for this consolidated technology. In 
general, solar energy market can be described as a market with steady growth and technology placed on 
the market long time ago. However, some part of the public and commercial sectors continue to be aware 
of these facts and are astonished by short-term profit objectives. Therefore, industries, public and private 
housing companies and public utilities, account for only a small portion of the users of installations for 
solar heating systems. The aim of this analysis is to describe the potential of water heating with solar 
energy and the expected market growth, as well as the main obstacles, in order to highlight opportunities 
to spread the use of solar heating energy market and housing sector. There have been a number of recent 
important market development studies and potential of solar energy systems. All these studies have 
reached the same result: The market is very large and, taken as a whole; it is growing steadily, although 
growth performance largely varies from state to state. These studies show that the potential of solar 
collectors for the housing sector and district heating sector can be easily expressed as a very significant 
figure: 0.5 to 1.0 m2 solar collectors per capita
The minimum value represents warmer climates and high value the climates of Northern Europe and 
Central Europe. Studies also show that the number in question could go to 1 m2 solar collector per capita 
in countries with warm climate. In Albania there are excellent conditions for water heating by solar energy 
heating systems. Annual solar radiation is high and could theoretically provide to Albania adequate
heating water at low temperature over a period of at least (7-8) months. The regime of solar radiation and 
annual sunshine hours in Albania are shown in Figures 15 and 16.
Solar collector systems available in Albanian markets rely on electricity as additional energy, especially 
during the period from November to March. Also, it is worth noting that the demand for energy for 
heating water in a family of 4 people is approximately 2,500 kWh /year. The need for additional energy 
can be reduced by installing more effective solar panels, but as a result it will increase the surplus of solar 
energy from April to September.
As noted from the charts, for an average efficiency of 55% of solar systems, NUED systems can provide 
up to 68% of the energy demand for water heating in Peshkopi, which goes up to 86% in Saranda.
MEI during the period 2009-2015, assisted by the program of FGM / UNDP "Global initiative to 
transform and strengthen the market for the use of solar energy for water heating: Program for Albania", 
MEI has taken over many tasks, particularly with regard to monitoring systems for solar heating installed 
so far in Albania and assessment of the future market for households, dwellings and public and private 
services, as well as for a number of industry sub-sectors.

3.7.2 Wind energy potential
Wind energy is used for pumping water, windmills and in recent decades the focus is shifted on the 
production of electricity. Machinery operated by wind energy have an installed capacity varying from
several [kW] to 5 [MW] and are being used successfully in isolated areas. Wind energy is a substantial
potential as an energy resource and is uniformly distributed all over the world. Windmills can be quickly 
installed and use a small area of land. In most countries, windmill installations face a common concern, 
lack of continuous measurement of wind velocity and lack of permanent wind.

Figure 21: Division into areas as per the number of annual hours of wind per average value of wind velocity.
Therefore, various companies wishing to invest in this sector can hardly decide whether it is worth 
investing in a particular region without these necessary data. Data obtained from different metrological 
stations in Albania are conservative/approximate and not very reliable because they are not gathered with
the specific purpose of measuring wind energy (table 14 and figure 21).
There are big plans for wind energy development in Albania in the coming years with significant 
investments, with a total of licensed windmills at a capacity of 1300 MW (Table 14) (licenses issued until 
2010).

Table 14: List of eolic parks for which license is granted for construction, installation and generation of electricity
With a view of assessing the potential of this source, it is estimated the level of production of the eolic 
parks planned for construction in Albania (Table 15).
Availability of eolic park or load factor - the percentage of time during which the wind turbines are able 
to work at full-load is universally regarded as the biggest problem for wind energy. Uncertainty about the 
amount to be produced by an eolic park is a real challenge. The methodology of forecasting and 
estimating wind sources are tasks of the experts. The average annual wind measurements between 5,8 m/ 
s to 7 m /s in the requested areas are promising. The table below can show load factors typically varying 
from 22% to 25%.
Licenses continued to be granted during the period 2010-2014 and by the end of December 2014 their 
total in Albania roughly amounted to 2548 MW, based on the information provided by the Ministry of 
Energy and Industry, with power generation potential of about 5 TWh / year. Albanian power system 
capacity to transmit and absorb wind energy is estimated to approximately 180-200 MW.
A balanced approach is required since the wind is an energy resource of low probability. The combination 
of wind and hydric resources is a good option. Hydro-plants can be commissioned at any time, therefore 
it is an excellent balancer of wind power plants.[60]

3.7.3 5.1.8 Geothermal energy reserves
There are a variety of geothermal resources, which can be classified into: hydrothermal springs, streams of
hot water and molten rocks. Of these three groups, to date only hydrothermal resources have been
practically used in Albania. Most of the time, hydrothermal sources are geothermal energy resources that 
produce hot water and are used in some countries for heating of various facilities.
A new technique of using geothermal energy is the injection of cold water in deep wells of oil and natural
gas, which are already no longer used for heating. Water is injected at a temperature of (7-8) ° C and
comes to the surface at a temperature of (22-25) ° C. In Albania there is little hope to produce steam
from geothermal sources, but there are several hydrothermal sources at a low temperature (Table 16).[61]

Table 16: Geothermal resources in Albania
The most important geothermal resources explored to date in Albania are as follows:
 Geothermal surface of Kruja, which is the area with the largest geothermal resources in Albania, 
with a surface area of 18 km length and 4,5 km width, containing reserves within a range of 
5.9x108-5.1x109 GJ.
 Geothermal area of Ardenica, where water comes out from the depth at a temperature of 32-38 
oC and flowing at surface with an intake of 15-18 l/s.
 Geothermal area of Peshkopi, where there are a number of geothermal sources located next to 
each other. Water intake is around 14-17 l/s and temperature is 35-43,5 oC.
3.7.9 RER input to power generation
In order to better prepare the implementation of Directive 2009/28/EC, similarly to all EU members 
and other Contracting Parties of CoE Treaty, Albania has conducted an assessment of the potential 
available for the development of renewable energy resources for power generation. Table 10, along with 
tables 1 and 3 of the National Action Plan for Renewable Energies, are used as a structure to sum up the 
main findings. 
For the energy sector, the projected installed capacity (accumulated) (in MW) and annual production 
(GWh) are shown as per each individual technology. As for the hydric sector, a distinction is made 
between the plants at an installed capacity of less than 1 MW, between 1 and 10 MW and above 10 MW. 
Details for solar energy are given separately for the inputs from power plants with photovoltaic solar 
panels and those with solar energy heating systems. Data on wind energy in the sea (onshore) and on the 
ground (offshore) are presented separately. As for the biomass used for electricity, a distinction needs to 
be made between the solid, gaseous and liquid biomass (tables 17.a and 17.b). Figure 22 introduces the 
power supply provision under this study, based on different and updated studies. Furthermore, the 
relevant cover for each plant (including RESplants) is given in Figures 22-26.[62]

Energy balance sheet of Albania for year 2013 (Source: NANRF – May 2015)ANNEX III: FEED-IN TARIFFS FOR WIND-POWER PLANT TECHNOLOGIES
AND PHOTOVOLTAIC PLANTS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
Feed-in tariffs for wind power plants
For many REStechnologies in general and wind power plants in particular, specific costs of energy
generation in MWh vary according to the plant size; this is typical for small and large wind turbines etc. 
Almost all EU candidate and non-candidate countries apply feed-in tariffs at different levels of
remuneration, mainly based on the plant size within these technologies. By applying this approach, due 
account can be taken of the low/high energy generation costs due to scale economies / non-economies. 
The range of prices can be too high for different capacities installed. Figure 1 introduces a comparison of
wind power plants in different countries and according to different sizes.
Figure 27.: Comparison of feed-in tariffs for wind power plants for different countries and different sizes (€ cent/kWh)
The projects of wind power plants require high initial investments; therefore CAPEX projection is highly 
critical. Figure 2 introduces the results for feed-in tariffs for wind power plants, based on the average 
feed-in tariffs (retrieved from figure 1) for installations of wind power plants at a higher capacity. 
Figure 28.: Comparison of feed-in tariffs for wind power plants for different countries and average capacities (€ cent/kWh)For a number of REStechnologies in general and PV plants in particular, the specific costs of power 
generation per MWh vary as per the plant size. This is typical for PV plants, solar power plants, biomass 
and biogas, geothermal plants, small wind power plants etc. Almost all EU candidate and non-candidate 
countries apply feed-in tariffs at different compensation rates, mainly on the basis of plant size within 
these technologies. By applying this approach, due account can be taken of the low/high power 
production costs, due to scale economies/non-economies. The range of prices may be too high. In 
Germany, for solar power plants with a capacity between 500 kW and 5 MW, the tariff level varies from 
130 to 80 €/MWh, while the United Kingdom falls within another extreme category, with a feed-in tariff
starting from 61 €/MWh for 5 MW up to270 €/MWh for 15 kW plants. Figure 3 introduces a 
comparison of feed-in tariffs for PV solar power plants for different countries and plant sizes.
Figure 29.: Comparison of feed-in tariffs for the PV solar plants for different countries and different sizes (€ cent/kWh)
Figure 4 shows the average feed-in tariffs (retrieved from figure 3) for PV plants with an average installed 
capacity (PV plants of 200-1000 kW).
