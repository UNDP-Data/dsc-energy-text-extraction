The government of the Kingdom of Bahrain is committed to the sustainability of the 
country’s natural resources for future generations, as well as the protection of the 
environment. There is considerable potential for undertaking energy efficiency and 
renewable energy initiatives in Bahrain, which will extend the lifetime of oil and gas 
reserves, and enable long-term sustainable development. Bahrain’s Economic Vision 
2030 puts special emphasis on providing incentives for reducing and managing 
electricity demand, and investing in clean energy technologies; promoting energy 
efficiency standards to ensure sustainability; and ensuring better energy and water 
demand management. 
Progress has already been achieved, indeed Bahrain has been a pioneer on the way to 
a more sustainable future. The Kingdom was one of the first countries to install utilityscale wind turbines on a new commercial development, the iconic World Trade Center 
in 2008; and Bahrain was the first country in the GCC to have a district cooling system. 
There are already several private sector renewable energy systems in operation; and a 
number of initiatives are underway to facilitate more efficient energy use.
In order to unify and consolidate efforts on energy efficiency and renewable energy, 
the Sustainable Energy Unit was established in November 2014. The Sustainable Energy 
Unit is mandated to develop strategies and policies for the integrated planning of 
energy sources in the Kingdom, as well as the rationalization of energy use, and to raise 
efficiency in all sectors through coordination with all concerned parties. To this end, 
the Sustainable Energy Unit, in consultation with key stakeholders, has formulated the 
National Renewable Energy Action Plan and the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, 
which were endorsed by the Cabinet (resolution no. 2384-08). 
These plans are an important milestone in setting out Bahrain’s national targets for 
renewable energy deployment and the adoption of energy efficiency initiatives. As 
such, they represent the Kingdom’s efforts to deliver the sustainable energy transition 
envisioned in the Economic Vision 2030 and the Government Action Plan 2015-2018. 
The plans also represent the implementation of the Kingdom’s regional and international 
commitments under the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals, and the League of Arab States Renewable Energy Framework and Guidelines on 
Energy Efficiency. 
The initiatives within the plans, with the support of leadership across all ministries, and 
from key stakeholders and members of society, will enable the Kingdom’s sustainable 
future. By working together, Bahrain can achieve its sustainable energy objectives, 
which will benefit the Kingdom economically and environmentally.

His Excellency, Dr. Abdul Hussain bin Ali Mirzaingdom of Bahrain
nal Renewable Energy Action Plan
In recognition of both the need and potential to diversify Bahrain’s energy sector to 
include renewable sources, and to develop innovative ways to ensure the most efficient 
use of energy, the UNDP has been working with the Government of Bahrain for a number 
of years to respond to the important issue of sustainable energy. The UNDP is delighted 
to support the Office of the Minister of Electricity and Water Affairs in establishing the 
Sustainable Energy Unit, for the benefit of the people of Bahrain, and to further the 
sustainable development of the country. 
The publication of the National Renewable Energy Action Plan and the National Energy 
Efficiency Plan is an important milestone in Bahrain’s national development. The 
leadership of the Kingdom of Bahrain is to be applauded for taking active steps towards 
a sustainable future. 
The plans align closely with the framework of the UN Secretary General’s Sustainable 
Energy for All (SE4All) Initiative that supports universal access to modern energy services, 
acceleration in energy efficiency improvements, and the increased use of renewable 
energy in the energy mix.
It also supports the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which includes the 
United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals for social progress, economic growth 
and environmental protection. By focusing on renewable energy and energy efficiency, 
the Kingdom of Bahrain is supporting the realization of the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goal No. 7: Ensuring acess to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern 
energy for all. 
The Bahraini National Renewable Energy Action Plan and the National Energy Efficiency 
Action Plan are on par with similar initiatives in other Arab countries, and will help to 
promote the exchange of successful international experiences for the benefit of Bahrain’s 
ambitious development agenda. 
To achieve these objectives, the UNDP will facilitate access to expertise from within the 
UN system and the international energy community. Most importantly, the plans will 
become a building block to achieve Bahrain’s Economic Vision 2030 and has energy 
efficiency and renewable energy as top priorities. This vision marks a new era of 
development and modernization for the Kingdom of Bahrain and the UNDP will continue 
to support Bahrain’s leadership in implementing these important sustainable energy 
initiatives.

BACKGROUND
The Kingdom of Bahrain, despite being a small island country, possesses abundant renewable 
energy resources, including solar and wind that have been largely untapped. Renewable 
energy is a clean, non-exhaustible, and local source of energy, an important component 
for building a reliable, resilient, and sustainable energy system. Today the Kingdom’s power 
generation system relies exclusively on natural gas, which is a scarce and diminishing 
resource. Current projections on the availability of gas reserves suggest that Bahrain will no 
longer be able to meet its domestic consumption, and will have to rely on imported gas as 
early as 2018. By introducing renewable energy into the energy mix and adopting energy 
efficiency policies, Bahrain can reduce its reliance on imported energy, prolong the lifetime of 
the indigenous gas resource, and optimize its economic value.
In clear recognition of the benefits of renewable energy, the Kingdom of Bahrain is committed 
to the development of renewable energy initiatives by harnessing the country’s renewable 
energy resources. The National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) represents the 
Kingdom’s efforts to deliver the sustainable energy transition envisioned in the Economic 
Vision 2030 and the Government Action Plan 2015-2018. This Plan also represents the 
implementation of the Kingdom’s regional and international commitments under the Paris 
Agreement, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and the League of Arab 
States Renewable Energy Framework.
The Plan identifies feasible renewable energy options for Bahrain, sets the targets, and proposes 
policies and actions to harness the identified renewable energy opportunities. The NREAP has 
been prepared by the Sustainable Energy Unit (SEU) through broad consultations with key 
stakeholder groups, including the Electricity and Water Authority, the National Oil and Gas 
Authority, the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry of Works, Urban Planning and Municipalities, 
the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, the Supreme Council for Environment, the 
Economic Development Board, the Bahrain Defense Force, large industry groups, academia, 
and others.Based on a broad survey of Bahrain’s resource potential, economic viability of various 
renewable energy technologies, the current energy situation, and the country’s unique 
geographical conditions, the Plan sets a national renewable energy target of: 
-5% by 2025 
-10% by 2035 
The targets are based on the projected peak load electricity capacities, excluding industry’s 
own generation, and equate to 255 MW of installed capacity by 2025, and to 710 MW by 
2035. The targets will be met by a proposed renewable energy mix consisting of solar, wind, 
and waste to energy technologies.
BENEFITS AND IMPACT
Integrating renewable energy in the energy mix can help Bahrain optimize the use of 
indigenous gas resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make the economy more 
competitive, decrease electricity peak demand, and improve energy security in the longterm. Achieving the 5% renewable energy target will result in:
- Clean energy generation of approximately 480 GWh per year
- Annual savings of 5,700,000 MMbtu of natural gas
- Annual financial savings of BD 1.6 million 
- Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 392,000 tonnes of CO2 per year
- Attraction of more than BD 140 million of investment.ingdom of Bahrain

The details of each policy will be outlined in relevant documents and regulations.In Bahrain, land is a scarce resource, as such the deployment strategy of renewable energy 
focuses on decentralized urban generation, large-scale generation on available land, and 
offshore generation.
I. DECENTRALIZED URBAN GENERATION (100-150 MW)
Decentralized renewable energy applications, such as rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV), 
building integrated PV, solar lighting, biogas plants, and micro wind turbines, can be 
successfully integrated in the urban environment. This allows not only transitioning to a 
more sustainable energy system, but also engages all members of the society, including 
households, businesses, academia, and governmental authorities in building smart, modern, 
and resilient cities and communities. Viable opportunities for decentralized urban generation 
include:
- Solar systems for new housing units
- Solar systems for government buildings
- Decentralized solar in urban developments (solar lighting, solar parking)
- Decentralized rooftop solar on existing residential and commercial buildings
- Other decentralized renewable energy systems (biogas, micro wind).
II. LARGE-SCALE GENERATION ON AVAILABLE LAND (50-100 MW)
Economies of scale favor the development of large-scale renewable energy power plants. 
Therefore, it is prudent to consider the deployment of large-scale renewable energy where 
land is available. Viable opportunities for large-scale generation on land include:
- Solar farm on Askar landfill site
- EWA renewable energy initiative (5 MW hybrid solar and wind project)
- Utility-scale renewable energy plants by large industry groups
- Solar farms in new town developments
- Waste to energy plant at the Tubli wastewater treatment plant
- Renewable energy plants on other available land. ingdom of Bahrain
nal Renewable Energy Action Plan
Offshore renewable energy development presents an opportunity to pursue large-scale 
generation and achieve higher renewable energy targets. Bahrain has a good wind regime 
and shallow waters, therefore pursuing offshore wind power could be a cost-competitive 
option. Other offshore renewable energy options include integrating renewable energy in 
offshore large infrastructure projects connecting Bahrain and its GCC neighbors. This will not 
only generate clean energy, but also strengthen the regional partnerships in building a more 
sustainable future. Identified offshore generation opportunities include:
- Near shore or offshore wind farms
- Integrating renewable energy technologies in large infrastructure projects (causeways 
and railway systems).
GOVERNANCE
I. SUSTAINABLE ENERGY UNIT

THE PARIS AGREEMENT
In December 2015, the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change took place in Paris. As a result, 195 nations adopted the Paris 
Agreement on taking action toward holding the increase of global average temperature to 
well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement is a historic international 
treaty to combat climate change, and accelerate actions and investments needed for a 
sustainable low carbon future. On 22 April 2016 Bahrain signed the Paris Agreement, and 
expressed its support through publication of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 
(INDC) in November 2015 [1].
The INDC is an official pledge by the Kingdom to support the global efforts in combating 
climate change, by taking specific actions to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions. 
Renewable energy and energy efficiency represent key initiatives in Bahrain’s INDC, as both 
hold great potential to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well as promoting sustainable In September 2015, at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, world leaders 
officially adopted a new agenda entitled “Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development.” The new global agenda includes 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets. The SDGs represent a consensus of the 193 member states of 
the United Nations to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure the prosperity for all. SDG 
7 calls the countries to “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy 
for all.” [2] This goal is supported by five targets to be achieved by 2030: 
; Ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services
; Increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix
; Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency
; Enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research 
and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and 
cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and 
clean energy technology
; Expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable 
energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed 
countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in 
accordance with their respective programmes of support
The government of the Kingdom of Bahrain embraced the challenge of meeting the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015, and expressed its commitment to the 
Post-2015 development agenda process at the press conference in the UN Sustainable 
Development Summit, held on 20 September 2015.
LEAGUE OF ARAB STATES – ARAB RENEWABLE ENERGY FRAMEWORK
In April 2013, the Arab Ministerial Council for Electricity of the League of Arab States adopted 
the “Arab Renewable Energy Framework,” which seeks to promote renewable energy 
development in the Arab region (Arab Guidelines). Article 2 of these Guidelines states that 
“Each Arab State shall adopt a national renewable energy action plan (NREAP), setting out 
Arab States’ national targets for the share of energy from renewable sources consumed in 
electricity generation,...” [3] The NREAP is drafted in accordance with the template suggested 
by the Arab Guidelines.ingdom of Bahrain
nal Renewable Energy Action Plan
Pursuing renewable energy is not only an international commitment of Bahrain, but also of 
national interest. Today the Kingdom’s power generation system exclusively relies on natural 
gas, which is a scarce and diminishing resource. Current projections on the availability of 
gas reserves suggest that Bahrain will no longer be able to meet its domestic consumption, 
and will have to rely on imported gas as early as 2018. An increased reliance on imported 
energy is highly likely to increase energy prices for consumers. Renewable energy is a clean, 
non-exhaustible, and local source of energy, an important component for building a reliable, 
resilient, and sustainable energy system. Integrating renewable energy in the energy mix 
can help Bahrain optimize its use of indigenous gas resources, make the economy more 
competitive, and improve energy security in the long-term.
The development of sustainable energy is in line with the Kingdom’s Economic Vision 2030. 
The Economic Vision 2030 recognizes economic, social and environmental sustainability as 
one of its key principles. It indicates explicitly that the economic growth must never come at 
the expense of the environment and the long-term well-being of the people. Furthermore, 
it encourages investment in technologies that reduce carbon emissions, minimize pollution, 
and promote sustainable energy [4].
In clear recognition of the benefits of renewable energy, the Kingdom of Bahrain is committed 
to the development of low-carbon energy initiatives by harnessing the country’s renewable 
energy resource base. In 2015, the Government adopted the Government Action Plan 2015-
2018 to deliver sustainable change in line with the Economic Vision 2030. The Government 
Action Plan reflects the Government of Bahrain’s strategic priorities over the next four years, 
and seeks to capitalize on the Kingdom’s resources and capabilities to meet the needs of 
all Bahrainis. Under the “Environment and Urban Development” pillar, the Government 
made commitments to finding suitable sources of renewable energy to meet the growing 
energy demand in Bahrain. To achieve this, the Government will seek to explore the optimal 
renewable energy options such as wind and solar energy, and will take necessary steps to 
implement pilot projects to pave the way for larger-scale deployment [5].In November 2014, under Cabinet Resolution 4/2238, the government established the 
Sustainable Energy Unit (SEU) to lead and promote sustainable energy policies and practices 
in the Kingdom of Bahrain. SEU was established under the office of Minister of Energy, 
with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) [6]. Due to the 
broad central government restructuring in summer 2016, SEU became one of the initiatives 
governed by the Office of the Minister of Electricity and Water Affairs. 
The key objectives of SEU are to develop a cohesive sustainable energy policy framework to 
promote renewable energy, energy efficiency, and conservation in the country. SEU will also 
work towards bridging the legal, institutional, and capacity gaps in order for Bahrain’s energy 
sector to meet future challenges.
The mandate of SEU includes: 
- Synergizing and consolidating existing efforts of public, private and international 
institutions in achieving goals as stated in the Bahrain Economic Vision 2030; 
- Supporting the creation of an enabling environment for energy efficiency and renewable 
energy technology transfer, and private sector investments;
- Supporting the development of necessary policies, regulations and standards across 
various sectors;
- Promoting replication and up-scaling of successful pilot project and initiatives across the 
Kingdom;
- Strengthening national capacity on deployment of renewable energy and energy 
efficiency technologies;
- Coordinating the implementation of national, regional and international obligations 
related to energy efficiency and renewable energy; and 
- Raising public awareness on the benefits of energy efficiency and renewable energy. 
The NREAP represents one of the key components of the Kingdom’s efforts to implement 
its national, regional and international commitments in the field of sustainable energy 
development and climate change. It identifies the viable renewable energy options, sets 
the targets, and proposes policies and actions to harness the identified renewable energy 
opportunities. SEU under the guidance of the Minister of Electricity and Water Affairs will lead 
the coordination of the implementation of the Plan.ingdom of Bahrain

2.1 OIL AND GAS
In 2014, Bahrain’s total energy consumption came from two sources: oil (17%) and 
natural gas (83%). To meet its domestic energy demand Bahrain relies on its indigenous 
hydrocarbon resources. Bahrain was the first country in the GCC region to discover oil reserves 
in 1932. Crude oil production reached its peak in 1970, and since then it has been gradually 
declining. In 2014, crude oil production amounted to 202,000 barrels a day. Bahrain’s crude 
oil production came from two fields: the Bahrain field with a production of around 49,000 
barrels a day and the Abu Saafa joint offshore field with Saudi Arabia, with a production 
of around 154,000 barrels a day [7]. At current production levels, the oil reserves have a 
projected lifetime of about 11 years.
Natural gas is the backbone of the energy system and economy of Bahrain. Today 
Bahrain entirely relies on natural gas for its power and water generation. Natural gas is 
also economically critical for operation of the Kingdom’s industrial sector. In 2014, Bahrain 
produced 728 billion cubic feet of natural gas [7]. All natural gas has been used for domestic 
consumption in the following sectors: 41% by the manufacturing sector; 33% for power and 
water generation; and 25% was re-injected for enhanced oil recovery [8]. The projected 
lifetime of natural gas reserves is about 15 years.
In 2014, the manufacturing sector was the third most important sector in the economy, 
accounting for 15% of the Kingdom’s GDP, after oil and gas (23%) and financial services 
(15.5%) [9]. It also provided for 18% of all private sector employment [8]. The Economic 
Development Board reinforces the fact that it is economically more advantageous to save 
the natural gas for consumption by the more productive sectors of the economy, such as 
manufacturing, and find alternative cost-competitive energy sources for power and water 
generation [8]. 
Figure 2 depicts historical energy supply and demand trends in Bahrain. It shows that the 
overall levels of energy production and consumption have increased year on year. As the 
population continues to grow, and the limited amount of fossil fuels begins to diminish, it 
may not be possible for Bahrain to meet its growing energy demand without relying on 
imported energy. Bahrain is already planning to import natural gas as early as 2018, and the 
steps are underway to complete the construction of an LNG import facility by 2018.0.0

An increased reliance on imported energy is highly likely to result in an increase of energy 
prices for consumers. In anticipation of the diminishing gas supply, the government adopted 
a new gas pricing policy in 2015. Under this policy, the price of natural gas sold to domestic 
companies will increase by USD 0.25 per MMbtu1 each year on 1 April. The pricing policy will 
be reviewed when the price reaches USD 4 per MMbtu2 by 1 April 2021 [8]. The first price 
increase took place on 1 April 2015, from USD 2.25 to 2.50 per MMbtu. 
Introducing renewable energy into the energy mix and adopting energy efficiency policies, 
can help Bahrain reduce its reliance on imported energy, prolong the lifetime of the indigenous 
natural gas resource, and optimize its economic value. This approach will improve energy 
security in the long-term and will have an overall positive impact on competitiveness of the 
manufacturing industry and environmental performance of the energy sector.

2.2.1 ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AND DEMAND
With the adoption of the Electricity Law in 1996, the private sector has been allowed 
to participate in the power generation market [10]. Today Bahrain has one of the most 
privatized power generation markets in the region. Independent power producers (IPPs) 
generate 80% of grid-supplied electricity.
In 2014, the Kingdom had 6,204 MW of installed capacity. Of this 2,274 MW were captive 
power plants, owned and operated by large industry groups such as Alba, BAPCO and GPIC. 
Independent power and water producers (IWPPs) own and operat
e 3,100 MW, and 825 MW are owned and operated by Electricity and Water Authority (EWA). 
In addition, Bahrain can import and export electricity through its 600 MW capacity GCC 
interconnection with the GCCIA (the GCC Interconnection Authority). Power produced by 
captive power plants is consumed on site by large industry groups. Power produced by IWPPs 
and EWA is distributed and sold to customers by EWA. EWA is the sole body responsible for 
electricity transmission, distribution, and grid operation.

and consumed by large industrial users. All the electricity was produced from natural gas. 
The residential sector used most of the grid electricity, at 46% of total grid consumption. 
Grid electricity consumption grew from 5,516 GWh in 2000 to 15,186 GWh in 2014, with an 
annual average growth rate of 7.5%. The commercial sector was the second-largest user, 
accounting for 36.4%, followed by the industrial sector, at 17.3%. The agricultural sector was 
a marginal user at 0.3% [11]. 
Similar to other GCC countries, Bahrain has a large seasonal variation in electricity 
consumption. Due to very hot summers, electricity consumption during the months from 
May to October increases significantly. This is mainly due to the heavy use of air-conditioning 
units, which account for 60%-65% of electricity usage in buildings. In 2014, the highest 
peak electricity consumption occurred in August (1,720 GWh) and the lowest electricity 
consumption occurred in January (701 GWh). Total electricity consumption in August was two 
and a half times higher than electricity consumption in January.

Aside from seasonal peaks, Bahrain also has daily electricity consumption peaks. Bahrain 
has two daily peaks: the first peak occurring between 11:00 and 16:00, and the second 
occurring between 18:00 and 19:00. Table 1 shows peak consumption on a typical summer 
day (31 August 2015), compared with electricity consumption during a typical winter day 
(31 January 2015).

To meet peak demand the government needs to have extra generation capacity units, which 
is costly. According to the World Bank analysis of the demand curve recorded in 2014, the 
network required an additional 500 MW, which operates for less than 50 hours a year. 
The estimated cost for the government to maintain 500 MW over a 20-year period is over 
USD 600 million3. This amount excludes the fuel costs of producing electricity, and variable 
operation and maintenance costs [11]. The inclusion of solar PV power in the energy supply 
mix can provide a valuable benefit by reducing the daytime peak, as the solar radiation 
hours correlate with day peaking hours.

As the power in Bahrain is entirely produced from natural gas, the cost of power generation 
largely depends on the fuel price. The current cost of power generation is 22 fils/kWh. 
The electricity transmission cost is 3.3 fils/kWh, and the distribution cost is 3.7 fils/kWh. In 
total, it costs 29 fils/kWh for EWA to supply power to end customers. This cost is based on 
a natural gas price of USD 2.5 per MMbtu. As the cost of natural gas will increase by USD 
0.254 per year, the cost of electricity supply will also increase. According to unofficial expert 
estimations, the cost of electricity supply (including transmission and distribution costs) from 
natural gas could increase to 36 fils/kWh by 2020, based on the planned gas price increases 
(see Figure 8).

Historically natural gas has been the most cost effective way to provide the country with 
electricity. However, from an economic and financial perspective, planned gas price increases 
make renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, a cost-competitive alternative source 
of energy, in the electricity generation mix. 
Up until recently electricity and water tariffs were subsidized. Effective from 1 March 2016, 
new electricity and water tariffs have been applied to electricity and water consumers in 
accordance with the new tariff schedule announced by the Electricity and Water Authority. 
The electricity tariffs will be gradually increased to meet the cost of power generation of 29 
fils/kWh by 2019. The new tariffs are applicable to all residential, commercial, and industrial 
consumers. Bahraini citizens holding a single EWA account are exempt from tariff increases

2.2.3 SHARE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY
According to the League of Arab States Arab Renewable Energy Framework, countries need 
to present a unified energy baseline based on 2010 in terms of energy generation from all 
sources, both renewable and non-renewable. The energy baseline for 2010 and 2014 are 
presented in Table 2 below. 
Currently the share of renewable energy in the electricity generation mix is negligible. In 
2014, two pilot renewable energy projects were in place: a 0.5 MW building-integrated 
wind project at the Bahrain World Trade Center; and a 5 MW solar PV system installed by 
BAPCO. The BAPCO 5 MW PV plant is a distributed smart solar PV system deployed in three 
locations: (1) 501 kW at the campus of Bahrain University; (2) 2.7 MW on the BAPCO refinery 
car parking lot; and (3) 1.8 MW at Awali town. The BAPCO PV plant was installed as a pilot 
project to test and demonstrate the technical viability of the project [13]. ingdom of Bahrain

The utilization of renewable energy in the rest of the Arab world is comparatively higher. 
Table 3 presents an overview of non-hydro renewable energy installed capacities, and 
renewable energy projects under construction in other Arab countries in 2014. In the past 
two years, these countries have progressed and more renewable energy projects have been 
installed. The deployment of wind power was leading in earlier years in countries with 
favorable wind regimes. However, the trend is moving towards more solar PV installations 
as the prices have decreased, as evidenced by the number of projects under construction in 
each country [14].

Source: Arab Future Energy Index, 2015Currently Bahrain has 1.3 million people, of which 48% are Bahraini nationals [15]. 
According to projections from the Central Information Organization, the population of 
Bahrain is expected to reach 1,850,000 by 2020 and 2,130,000 by 2030. In addition to 
population growth, Bahrain’s industrial sector is projected to expand. One of the largest 
industrial expansion projects includes ‘Line 6 Expansion Project’ of Alba, one of the world’s 
largest aluminum smelting companies. With the construction of the Line 6 Expansion Project, 
Alba’s gas consumption is projected to increase. Other major industrial expansion projects 
include BAPCO’s Modernization Program, the Bahrain Gas Plant Project, and others. The 
development of mega infrastructure projects such as the regional GCC high-speed rail link 
and a new causeway between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, will have a significant impact 
on improving transportation logistics. These projects are expected to further increase the 
operations of industrial sector. 
With the current projections of population growth, economic development, and expansion 
of industries, the demand for energy will increase. EWA has projected electricity demand for 
2020 and 2030 under three growth scenarios starting from 2013: low, medium, and high, 
depicted in Figure 10. According to these projections under the low growth scenario power 
demand in 2030 of grid-supplied electricity will reach 21,700 GWh, under the medium 
growth scenario power demand in 2030 will nearly double reaching 28,180 GWh, and under 
the high scenario power demand will reach 34,550 GWh.

wind technologies have witnessed major advancements, becoming financially competitive 
alternatives to energy generated from fossil fuel. As Bahrain is blessed with renewable 
energy resources, an overview of opportunities has been conducted in consultations with 
key stakeholders. The overview focused on resource potential, high-level economic viability5, 
and technology specific benefits and challenges. The main technologies considered include 
solar, wind, and waste to energy.

3.1.1 RESOURCE POTENTIAL
Similar to its GCC neighbors, Bahrain enjoys relatively strong solar resource potential. Global 
horizontal irradiance is around 2,120 kWh/m2 and the estimated annual PV generation is 
around 1,600-1,700 kWh/kWp/year, as shown in Figure 12. According to measurements 
taken at the PV plant installed at the Bahrain University campus, the average solar radiation 
was around 5.18 kWh/m2/day, with an average sunshine duration of 9.2 hours [13].

There are three primary technologies that convert solar energy into useful energy: 
photovoltaic (PV), which directly converts solar light into electricity; concentrating solar 
power (CSP) which uses concentrated sunlight and converts it to heat to drive conventional 
power generation turbines; and solar heating and cooling systems which collect solar thermal 
energy to provide hot water and air conditioning. This section presents an overview of these 
technologies, including specific advantages and disadvantages. 
SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV)
Photovoltaic (PV) cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. A solar panel is comprised of 
many PV cells. A wide range of PV cell technologies are available on the market today. The 
most commonly used PV cells in the market are crystalline silicon (c-Si) and thin films PV 
cells. According to the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy global PV production in 2015 was 
dominated by multi-crystalline silicon (69%), followed by mono-crystalline silicon (24%), 
and thin film (6%) [16]. There is a lot of literature describing differences, advantages and 
disadvantages of each PV technology. In general, crystalline silicon cells are more efficient 
(13-19%), more space efficient, but more expensive to produce. They are also rigid and must 
be mounted in a rigid frame to protect them. Thin films are less efficient (7-13%), have lower 
space-efficiency, and are less expensive to manufacture. They can be made flexible, which 
allows them to be used in multiple applications [17, 18, 19].
A solar PV system comprises of different components including solar panels, inverters, 
metering system, and interface protection. There are two main types of PV systems: gridconnected and stand-alone off-grid systems. A grid-connected PV system can be used to 
feed on-site consumption and the surplus can be delivered to the electricity grid. Off-grid PV 
systems require batteries and are thus more expensive. Off-grid solutions are usually better 
for remote areas, or loads, which are not connected to the electricity network.
Solar PV presents two advantages that are important in the context of Bahrain. First, the 
modular nature of solar PV makes it well suited for small-scale decentralized applications. 
Decentralized renewable energy generation refers to power production close to the point 
of consumption, such as rooftop PV. Unlike any other electricity technology, solar PV can be 
deployed economically at virtually any scale. A residential solar PV system depending on 
the efficiency of the panels on average requires 5-10 m2/kWp, which can be deployed on 
roofs, parking lots and other spaces. Having limited land resources to accommodate largescale renewable energy projects, distributed solar PV generation at the level of households, 
commercial and government buildings can play an important role in Bahrain’s energy mix. of any renewable technology in use today. Solar PV prices have declined by 75-80% since 
2006, making solar PV an attractive and cost-competitive source of power generation. In 
Germany, the cost of power from utility-scale PV plants fell from over 40 EUR cent/kWh6
in 2005, to 9 EUR cent/kWh7 in 2014 [20]. In early 2015, the Dubai Electricity and Water 
Authority (DEWA) awarded a 200 MW utility-scale PV plant contract at the price of 5.84 US 
cents/kWh8. One year later, DEWA received an even lower bid of 2.99 US cents/kWh9 for 
the development of 800 MW PV project, which made major news headlines as the world’s 
cheapest solar PV price [21].
 Solar PV has an average lifespan of 20-25 years and its efficiency degrades at the rate of 
0.5 to 1% per year. Recent data indicates that the upfront capital investment requirement is 
around USD 1,100/kWp10 for PV projects above 1 MW and about USD 1,400/kWp11 for smallscale PV.12 Impressive progress has also been achieved in lowering the cost of inverters. 
Prices for inverters declined from 1 EUR/Wp13 in 1990, to almost 0.10 EUR/Wp14 in 2014, 
while efficiency and power density have increased significantly.
The following chart illustrates current and future projected levelized cost of electricity for 
utility-scale PV projects (larger than 1 MW) in Bahrain with three different discount rates. 
The estimations were calculated using the model prepared by the leading German think tank 
institution Agora Energiewende [22]. In 2015, the LCOE for utility-scale PV ranged from 6.7 
to 7.9 USD cents/kWh15 (based on a discount rate of 7.5%). This is comparable to PV prices 
tendered in neighboring Arab countries.16 The LCOE is expected to continue to decrease due 
to the decline in the cost of PV panels, inverters, installation, and financing.

is a challenging requirement in the Bahraini context, as the country is limited in its land 
availability. 
Taking into account the above factors, Bahrain will focus on promoting decentralized smallscale PV applications, unless available land is identified for the deployment of utility-scale 
PV plants.
BUILDING INTEGRATED PHOTOVOLTAIC
Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) can be a particularly interesting option for Bahrain 
as it requires little or no land space. BIPV refers to the solar photovoltaic materials that 
become part of the building elements such as roofs, skylights, windows, shading systems or 
façade. In other words, BIPV serves both as a building element and as a means of electricity 
production. In addition, BIPV can add to the architectural appeal of a building. By substituting 
BIPV for standard materials during the initial construction, building developers can reduce the 
incremental costs of PV systems and eliminate costs and design issues for separate mounted 
systems. 
A recent survey of BIPV projects in Europe, by the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of 
Southern Switzerland, found key essential facts about BIPV [23]: 
- The European market is supported by approximately 200 commercially available 
BIPV products
- When integrating PV in the roof of the building the cost of the roof increased on 
average by EUR20 200/m2 
- When integrating PV in the façade of the building, the cost was very similar to the 
costs of the conventional façade material (stone or glass). 
- The BIPV market is expected to experience significant growth in the near future 
due to the adoption of European Directive 2010/31/EU, which requires all new 
buildings from 2020 and onwards to be made ‘nearly zero-energy’ buildings. Zeroenergy building refers to the building with zero net energy consumption. In other 
words, the total annual energy consumption of the building should be roughly equal 
to the energy produced on-site usually from renewable sources. BIPV products will 
play an essential role in meeting this requirement.

design, minimizing the impact on the overall cost of construction. 
CONCENTRATING SOLAR POWER 
Concentrating solar power (CSP) systems generate electricity by using mirrors or lenses to 
concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a small area. Electricity is generated when the 
concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine (usually a steam turbine) 
connected to an electrical power generator. One advantage of CSP over solar PV, is that CSP 
plants can integrate low-cost thermal energy storage, which allows them to meet power 
needs several hours after sunset. However, CSP plants have three major disadvantages, 
which makes this technology a less suitable option for Bahrain: 
- CSP plants have high upfront capital requirements compared to solar PV. Unlike 
PV, CSP has not experienced a sharp decline in technology costs. Investment costs 
for CSP plants (without storage) range between USD 4,600 and 8,000/kW21 in 
OECD countries, and in non-OECD countries range between USD 3,500 and 7,300/
kW22 [24]. These prices are reported for parabolic trough collectors, which is the 
dominant technology used in CSP plants today (85% of all CSP projects installed 
globally are parabolic trough collectors). The operation and maintenance costs are 
estimated to be in the range of USD 0.02 to USD 0.04/kWh23 [24].
- Similar to utility-scale PV plants, CSP plants require large land areas. According 
to the US Solar Energy Industries Association, a typical CSP plant requires 2 to 4 
hectares of land per MW of installed capacity. Although CSP plants can be built in 
smaller sizes, a CSP plant operates most efficiently, and most cost-effectively, when 
built in capacities of 100 MW and higher [25].
- CSP plants require water for cooling. CSP plants are often designed to use cooling 
water at the back-end of the thermal cycle. A typical 50 MW parabolic trough plant 
uses 0.4-0.5 million m3 of water per year for cooling [26]. Water is also used for 
cleaning the mirrors to maintain their high reflectivity. Meeting these requirements 
for water might be challenging in Bahrain, given that most of the fresh water in 
Bahrain comes through an energy intensive process of desalination. 
Taking into account the above factors, Bahrain is unlikely to consider pursuing the deployment 
of CSP technologies at this stage.
21 Equivalent to BD 1,735 – 3,018/kW 3.2.1 RESOURCE POTENTIAL
A possible option for deployment of large-scale renewable energy plants in Bahrain is to 
pursue onshore and offshore wind power generation. Wind turbines harness the energy of 
moving air to generate electricity. Preliminary assessment of existing wind data suggests 
that there is good wind power potential in Bahrain. 
Analysis conducted by the University of Bahrain of the 10-year wind data set from the 
meteorological weather station24 shows that Bahrain enjoys an annual mean wind speed of 
6.9 m/s at 60 meters height (extrapolated), resulting in an average annual power density 
of 440 W/m2. The strongest wind regime was found in the central and southern parts of the 
main island of Bahrain [27]. According to the one-year measurements of wind speed from 
tall mast at 50 meters height, the most prevailing wind speed occurred at around 6 m/s. 
The highest wind speed reached almost 7 m/s.

speeds is required to establish the economic viability of wind power.

3.2.2 WIND TECHNOLOGIES
ONSHORE WIND
The current economics of wind power favors onshore wind. The capital requirements for 
onshore wind power plant is about USD 1,700/kW25. Wind turbines have an average lifetime 
of about 25 years. The main cost component in a wind project, is the cost of a wind turbine, 
which accounts for about 70% of the total cost [28]. A typical horizontal-axis wind turbine 
comprises of several components, including the blades, the hub, the nacelle, the gearbox, 
the tower, and associated electrical equipment.
Other costs in such projects include civil works, grid connection costs, project planning and 
development costs. A survey of over 5,000 turbines installed in Denmark since 2006, shows 
that operation and maintenance costs of onshore wind declined from 3% to less than 2% 
per year of invested capital. Other sources indicate that operation and maintenance costs of 
onshore wind range between 20%-25% of LCOE [28]. In very windy regions, the LCOE can be as low as 0.03-0.04 USD/kWh26, per the recent bids 
in Morocco and Egypt [29]. The following table illustrates the weighted average LCOE in 
different parts of the world.

Similar to solar PV technology, wind technology has experienced improvements and cost 
reductions. Since 2009, wind turbine prices decreased by 30% to 40% and are expected to 
decline further [28]. According to projections made by IRENA, the future global weighted 
average installed costs of onshore wind could fall by 12% by 2025, resulting in a 34% 
reduction of total LCOE [28].
A wind turbine takes up little ground space, as almost all the components are up to 60-80 
meters in the air. However, a wind farm (several wind turbines) requires available land 
without structures that might impede wind speeds, which is a limiting factor in Bahrain.
OFFSHORE WIND
Offshore wind power is where turbines are sited in water areas, such as coastal shallow water. 
Whilst offshore wind farms typically enjoy higher wind speeds, the marine environment 
exposes the units to high humidity, salt water, and salt-water spray making installation and 
operation and maintenance more challenging.
Most of the offshore wind is currently concentrated in Europe. The capital cost for offshore 
wind ranges from USD 2,500 to 5,600 per kW27. The capital cost largely depends on water 
depth, distance from shore, turbine size and other factors. According to IRENA’s projections, 
the future installed costs for a reference wind farm could be reduced by 15% from 2015 
costs, given technological innovations, economy of scales, and learning by doing. ingdom of Bahrain

Whilst onshore wind has favorable economics, as an island country, Bahrain clearly has 
technical potential for offshore wind power. In general, sea winds are stronger and steadier 
than on land. While the landscape, trees and buildings distort the flow of onshore wind, 
offshore wind flow can blow without obstacles with higher wind speeds and a more even 
flow close to the surface which allows lower tower heights [30]. The fact that the depth 
of water in Bahrain in general is shallow (less than 10 meters) at the coastal areas would 
in principal favor the deployment of cost-effective offshore wind. However, a number of 
parameters (e.g. nature of seabed, offshore wind conditions, grid connection, etc.) are not 
well known yet, and therefore the technical and economic feasibility for offshore wind 
power in Bahrain’s coastal waters requires further analysis.Many technologies have been developed and deployed to use waste as a fuel input for 
energy. This section presents an overview of some of the key waste to energy technologies 
that can be potentially deployed in Bahrain. 
3.3.1 BIOGAS
According to data from the Ministry of Works, Urban Planning and Municipalities Bahrain 
produces more than 1.7 million tons of solid waste per year, which instead of being 
landfilled can be used to produce electricity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Organic 
material, which is mostly food waste, makes up 60% of total municipal solid waste. Today 
all municipal solid waste in Bahrain is landfilled. According to unofficial expert estimations 
from the Ministry of Works, Urban Planning and Municipalities, Bahrain has only four to five 
years of landfill capacity left. 
Organic waste presents an excellent opportunity to turn waste into useful energy by extracting 
biogas through anaerobic digestion process. Anaerobic digestion is a bacterial decomposition 
process that stabilizes organic wastes and produces biogas, which is a mixture of methane 
and carbon dioxide. Agricultural and marine byproducts, crops, sewage sludge, municipal 
solid waste or any other biodegradable feedstock, under anaerobic conditions, can produce 
biogas. Biogas can be used for a number of applications including electricity generation, 
injection into the national gas grid, and as a vehicle fuel. It is estimated that Bahrain has a 
potential to generate 190 million m3 of biogas per year from its organic waste. 
In the European Union, anaerobic digestion is recognized as an essential step in a sustainable 
waste management process and as an efficient waste recycling method [31]. Today there 
are more than 13,800 biogas plants in operation in Europe. In Sweden, out of 230 biogas 
plants, 135 plants are at wastewater treatment facilities [32]. Adding an anaerobic digestion 
step to the wastewater treatment plant brings a number of benefits, including reducing the 
volume of sludge, reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from landfilling the sludge and 
generating renewable energy in the form of biogas. 
The investment requirements of a biogas plant depend on a number of factors including the 
type of technology, the type of waste, the size of the plant, and the automation involved. 
The average cost of a biogas-fueled power plant of 1 MW capacity, or larger, ranges between 
EUR 3,000 – 4,500 per kW28. Table 5 provides information on biogas production potential 
from different substrates. ingdom of Bahrain

Fish waste 42 1,279 537 71
Sorted food waste 33 618 204 63
An important precondition for implementing a biogas project is to have food and other 
organic waste to be separated out and collected from the rest of the
 municipal solid waste. This requires implementing a waste management strategy, an 
important component of which is education and raising awareness of households and 
businesses about separating out the waste. Unlike other organic waste streams, sewage 
sludge is already collected and concentrated in one place, which presents an opportunity for 
Bahrain to immediately pursue the energy recovery process from sewage sludge. 
3.3.2 LANDFILL GAS RECOVERY
Another waste to energy opportunity for potential consideration in Bahrain is landfill gas 
recovery. Landfill gas recovery has strong environmental benefits, as it is a means to collect 
the already available methane gas in the landfill, and prevent it from being released into 
the atmosphere. Landfill gas is a natural byproduct of a decomposition of organic material 
in the solid municipal waste and it is typically composed of 50% methane. Methane has a 
global warming potential 21 times greater than carbon dioxide, which makes it important 
to capture for both environmental and energy reasons. The recovered landfill gas can be 
used to produce medium-Btu gas (sometimes called ‘direct use’), or pipeline quality gas 
(sometimes called ‘high-Btu gas’), thereby reducing consumption of the indigenous gas 
resource [33].engines, combustion turbines, steam cycle power plants, and co-firing landfill gas with fossil 
fuels in conventional power plants. When landfill gas is used as a medium-Btu gas, it is 
directly used as a substitute for fossil fuel with little treatment. The typical application of 
medium-Btu gas is co-firing in existing conventional power plants. High-Btu gas production 
involves an extensive cleanup of the landfill gas to a level of quality so that it can be 
introduced into existing pipelines as a direct substitute for natural gas. 
3.3.3 OTHER WASTE TO ENERGY OPPORTUNITIES 
There are other waste to energy options available, including waste incineration, pyrolysis, 
biodiesel, and others. However, these options should be pursued after establishing a waste 
management strategy. The waste management strategy will lay down the rules and conditions 
for identifying, sorting and collecting waste streams that could be re-used or recycled such 
as plastic, paper or construction material. Depending on the composition of non-recyclable 
waste, the appropriate waste to energy options can be further considered. The international 
best practice on waste management suggests the following waste management hierarchy: 
1. Reduction
2. Re-use 
3. Recycling (e.g. using aluminum cans as raw material in aluminum production)
4. Resource recovery (e.g. recovering biogas from food waste)
5. Disposal (e.g. landfilling, waste incineration without energy recovery)
Waste disposal is the management option used for the remaining fraction of waste when 
all forms of diversion, reuse, and resource recovery are exhausted. Waste to energy options 
such as waste incineration or pyrolysis should be considered after reducing, re-using, and 
recycling of waste. ingdom of Bahrain
nal Renewable Energy Action Plan
Biomass, geothermal and hydropower have been cost-competitive sources of power 
generation for many years in regions with high resource supply potential. Hydropower and 
biomass were excluded from the evaluation in this Plan since Bahrain has no or very limited 
resource supply potential. 
Geothermal energy uses the heat from beneath the earth’s surface to generate electricity. 
High temperature geothermal resources (90-150 oC) can be used to generate electricity. 
Lower temperature geothermal resources can be used for direct heating applications. The 
constant temperature that exists at shallow depths can be used as an energy-efficient 
method of heating and cooling using heat pumps. Geothermal power is a mature, costcompetitive, commercially available renewable energy technology that can be used to 
provide base load capacity in areas with excellent high-temperatures resources that are 
close to the surface [24]. 
Geothermal co-production can potentially be an attractive option for Bahrain, where 
geothermal power is generated from the hot wastewater coming from the oil and gas 
extraction process. According to the US Department of Energy, co-produced geothermal 
energy can deliver near-term energy savings, extend the economic life of oil and gas fields, 
and profitably utilize abandoned oil and gas field infrastructure. There are already several 
pilot projects in the US testing the production of geothermal power at oil and gas fields [34].
An assessment of geothermal resource potential for Bahrain is yet to be undertaken. To draw 
conclusions on economic viability of geothermal power for Bahrain, further research and 
investigation is required.Different factors affect the selection of renewable energy technologies, some of these 
relate to the technology itself while others relate to geography and valued socio-economic 
components. Resource potential, capital investments, knowhow, land requirements, grid 
stability, weather and climate conditions are amongst the most influential factors. The 
following table presents a summary of advantages and disadvantages of selected renewable 
energy technologies.

4.1 TARGETS
The goal of the Plan is to create a renewable energy market in order to increase the share of 
renewable energy in the energy mix of Bahrain. This includes creating a business environment 
favorable to renewable energy investments, building expertise within industries and 
government agencies in developing renewable energy projects, strengthening institutional 
capacity to support the deployment of renewables, integrating renewable energy in the 
government strategies, policies and plans and raising overall awareness about the benefits 
and importance of sustainable energy development. To achieve this it is necessary to 
formulate ambitious, yet realistic renewable energy targets supported by an enabling 
policy framework, streamlined administrative procedures, and a general commitment by all 
government authorities to pursue renewable energy.
The renewable energy deployment strategy is based on a broad assessment of Bahrain’s 
resource potential, economic viability of various renewable energy technologies, current 
energy situation, and its unique geographical and socio-economic conditions.
Based on the findings, and through consultations with key stakeholders, a renewable energy 
target of 5% is proposed for 2025, and 10% for 2035. The targets are calculated as a share 
of the future projected peak load demand, excluding industry’s own generation. Values for 
electricity generation in GWh are derived based on these targets and the local resource 
potential as set out in Table 7.

potential, cost-effectiveness of renewable energy systems, socio-economic and geo-political 
considerations:
I. DECENTRALIZED URBAN GENERATION (100-150 MW)
Decentralized renewable energy applications such as rooftop PV, BIPV, solar lighting, biogas 
plants, and micro wind turbines can be successfully integrated in the urban environment and 
can help in creating a more sustainable future. With continuous technological improvements, 
the opportunities for integrating renewable energy in the urban design are tremendous. 
Decentralized urban generation is also an excellent way to engage all members of society 
including households, businesses, academia, and government authorities in building smart, 
modern and more resilient cities and communities. Viable opportunities for decentralized 
urban generation include:
- Solar systems for new housing units
- Solar systems for government buildings
- Decentralized solar in urban developments (solar lighting, solar parking)
- Decentralized rooftop solar on existing residential and commercial buildings
- Other decentralized renewable energy systems (biogas, micro wind).
II. LARGE-SCALE GENERATION ON AVAILABLE LAND (50-100 MW)
Economies of scale favor the development of large-scale renewable energy power plants. 
Therefore, it is prudent to consider deployment of large-scale renewable energy where land 
is available. A good example is the deployment of a solar farm on a land that is otherwise 
not useful, such as a closed landfill site. Another option to pursue large-scale renewable 
energy development is through joint GCC efforts (using land in neighboring countries and 
bringing electricity through existing interconnection network). Viable opportunities for largescale generation on land include:
- Solar farm on Askar landfill site
- EWA renewable energy initiative (5 MW hybrid solar and wind project)
- Utility-scale renewable energy plants by large industry groups
- Solar farms in new town developments
- Waste to energy plant at the Tubli wastewater treatment plant

Offshore renewable energy development presents an opportunity to pursue large-scale 
renewable energy generation and achieve higher renewable energy targets. As Bahrain 
has a good wind regime and shallow waters, pursuing offshore wind power could be a 
cost-competitive option. Other offshore renewable energy options can include integrating 
renewable energy in offshore large infrastructure projects such as causeways connecting 
Bahrain and its GCC neighbors. This will not only generate clean energy, but also strengthen 
partnerships in building a more sustainable future in the region. Identified offshore generation 
opportunities include:
- Near shore or offshore wind farms
- Integrating renewable energy technologies in large infrastructure projects 
(causeways and railway systems).
4.3 BENEFITS AND IMPACT
Integrating renewable energy in the energy mix can help Bahrain optimize the use of 
indigenous gas resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make the economy more 
competitive, and improve energy security in the long-term. Other benefits include improving 
local air quality, shaving day peak through solar PV, creating a new industry, and meeting 
international obligations. 
Achieving 5% targets by 2025 will result in: 
- Clean energy generation of approximately 480 GWh per year
- Annual savings of 5,700,000 MMbtu of natural gas
- Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 392,000 tonnes of CO2 per year
- Attracting more than BD 140 million of investment.An important aspect of creating a renewable energy market is removing structural and 
non-structural barriers. According to the IEA 2015 Renewable Energy Market Analysis report, 
high levels of incentives are no longer necessary for solar PV and onshore wind, but their 
economic attractiveness still strongly depends on the regulatory framework and market 
design. To facilitate renewable energy deployment in Bahrain, policies will be implemented 
to enable power to be produced from renewable energy sources, to stimulate investment 
and the take up of renewable energy technologies. These policies will aim to address the 
following regulatory and power market structure related barriers: 
4.4.1 ADDRESSING REGULATORY BARRIERS
The power sector by default is a heavily regulated sector. Typically, private production of 
electricity requires authorization from government authorities, either through legislation or 
concessions. In Bahrain, the current Electricity Law (1996) allows for the private generation 
of power. However, each IPP scheme requires a written authorization from the Minister and 
an approval from the Cabinet. This scheme is not suitable to stimulate private investments in 
renewable energy as it is geared towards large-scale conventional power plants, where fuel 
input is an important consideration. It was drafted in times when renewable energy was not 
considered a viable alternative source of energy. Today the situation is different. Renewable 
energy technologies have substantively matured, the costs have declined, and the options 
have improved. 
To stimulate investment in renewable energy, the current legislation needs to allow private 
deployment of renewable energy plants, without an extensive prior authorization process 
from the government. However, renewable energy systems would still be subject to all 
necessary building code requirements, grid connection rules, and other administrative safety 
regulations. 
4.4.2 ADDRESSING MARKET STRUCTURE RELATED BARRIERS
The Electricity Law allows on-site electricity generation for self-consumption purposes 
(captive generation), and has mainly been used to allow large industry groups to install 
their own power generation capacities. However the Law does not authorize exporting onsite generated energy to the main grid. To stimulate investments in renewable energy, 
especially by households and commercial users, it is important to allow renewable energy 
plants to export the excess power to the grid. Thus, it is critical to develop a grid code for 
renewable energy systems together with other safety regulations to ensure safe connection 
tthidingdom of Bahrain
nal Renewable Energy Action Plan
of electricity in the Kingdom. To motivate private developers to invest in renewable energy, 
there needs to be a mechanism whereby private investors are able to sell the power produced 
from renewable sources and generate income. The key components of such mechanism are 
price and guarantee of purchase of electricity from renewable sources. Thus, it is important 
to set a policy that will define a purchase price for electricity from renewable sources and 
guarantee the purchase of such electricity. Such policies can be either feed-in tariff policy, or 
auctions or public competitive tenders. 
4.4.3 DRIVING INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE ENERGY
In 2015, the government announced a scheme to gradually increase electricity tariffs to 
meet the cost of power generation of 29 fils/kWh. The new tariffs became effective starting 
March 2016 for residential, commercial, and industrial consumers. Bahraini nationals holding 
an EWA single account are exempt from the tariff increases and continue to pay electricity 
tariffs of 3 fils/kWh. Bahraini nationals make up 50% of the population and account for 
around 20% of electricity consumption, and are likely to have roof space for small-scale 
PV systems. To motivate this segment of customers to install renewable energy systems 
on their roofs, a special incentive scheme needs to be proposed, combined with targeted 
information dissemination and awareness raising campaign. 
Bahrain has a fast growing real-estate industry. There are many real estate development 
projects underway under private and public domains. New buildings and real estate 
development projects present an excellent opportunity for integrating cost-effective 
renewable energy solutions. Integrating renewables in the building design is more efficient 
and cost-effective than retrofitting renewable energy sources at a later stage. In addition, 
buildings are the biggest consumers of electricity in Bahrain. More than 80% of grid electricity 
is consumed by buildings. Currently there is no scheme in place to encourage building and 
town developers to integrate renewable energy in the building and urban design, such as a 
renewable energy mandate. To achieve the stated targets and attract private sector investment in renewable energy 
technologies, three complementary policies are proposed: (1) a net metering scheme; (2) 
tender-based feed-in tariffs; and (3) a renewable energy mandate for new buildings. The 
following subsections present brief information on each policy. The details of each policy will 
be outlined in relevant documents and regulations.
4.5.1 NET METERING SCHEME
To support the deployment of decentralized small-scale solar systems, the Government of 
Bahrain will adopt a Net Metering scheme. Net Metering will enable residential, commercial, 
and industrial customers to generate and consume electricity on-site by installing renewable 
energy systems on their premises, and exporting the excess electricity to the EWA network. 
Customers will be billed only for the ‘net’ energy used, according to the latest electricity 
retail tariffs approved by the Government. The excess electricity produced will be credited 
in the next billing period. The smart meter roll-out programme has commenced and will 
facilitate the net metering scheme.
Net metering is a strong incentive mechanism when electricity retail prices are sufficiently 
high. With the recent increases of electricity tariffs, the net metering scheme will likely be 
most attractive to the unsubsidized large energy consumers, such as malls, hotels, and other 
commercial and industrial customers.

4.5.2 TENDER BASED FEED-IN TARIFF
To encourage the deployment of renewable energy projects by private developers, the 
Government of Bahrain will adopt a tender-based feed-in tariff scheme. The feed-in tariff 
scheme will provide a long-term purchase guarantee of electricity from renewable sources 
at a pre-determined price. The appropriate feed-in tariff will be set based on the bids 
received from private developers. A feed-in tariff is important in attracting professional 
renewable energy developers who have expertise, know-how, and access to finance, in 
developing renewable energy projects. Because land is a major limiting factor in Bahrain, 
the government will aid the private sector by identifying and/or designating sites for the 
development of renewable energy projects. Such sites may include government buildings 
such as schools, hospitals, and other public facilities. This, however, will not limit the private 
sector to find their own sites for the development of renewable energy projects, under the 
tender-based feed-in tariffs scheme. Tenders will be announced on a regular basis. the best available market prices for the development of renewable energy projects. This is 
particularly important with regards to renewable energy systems that are experiencing fastpaced technological improvements and cost reductions, such as solar PV. The scheme will 
also allow the government to control the quantity of renewable energy procured.

nal Renewable Energy Action Plan
To take advantage of cost-effective renewable energy solutions and reduce the energy 
demand from buildings, the Government of Bahrain will adopt a Renewable Energy Mandate 
for new buildings. The Renewable Energy Mandate will require all new buildings and 
new real estate developments, to source a minimum certain percentage of energy from 
renewable sources such as roof-top PV, building integrated PV, solar water heaters, and urban 
wind systems. The generated renewable energy will be consumed on-site; and the excess 
electricity will be fed to the grid according to the Net Metering regulations. 
To recognize the outstanding performance of buildings and real estate developers in 
integrating renewable energy, where the minimum percentage has been exceeded, SEU will 
issue a certificate of award.

This section presents key renewable energy projects identified through a broad consultative 
process with different stakeholders to achieve the 2025 targets. The list is not exhaustive 
and may be updated as time progresses and more opportunities are identified. 
5.1 SOLAR SYSTEMS FOR GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS 
The Assistant Undersecretary of Construction Projects and Maintenance at the Ministry 
of Works, Urban Planning and Municipalities is responsible for the construction of new 
government buildings and for refurbishment of existing government buildings for the 
Kingdom of Bahrain. 
This Ministry is one of the champions in the government sector in promoting green building 
and sustainable energy practices. In 2011 the Assistant Undersecretary of Construction 
Projects and Maintenance developed a strategy to implement green building practices 
in new and existing government projects. To implement the Strategy particular building 
specifications have been developed containing 14 green building practices. Since 2013 the 
Ministry has been actively implementing these practices, achieving great energy savings 
and exceeding the requirements of the Bahrain thermal insulation regulations. Although 
the focus has been primarily on improving building energy efficiency, the Ministry has also 
started implementing experimental solar projects such as solar water heater systems on 
school buildings and solar PV panels on car parking lots.
To make government buildings more efficient and sustainable and to continue to demonstrate 
leadership in sustainability actions, the Ministry of Works, Urban Planning and Municipalities 
is committed to incorporate further renewable energy solutions in government projects 
(roof-top PV, building integrated PV, solar parking lots).
5.2 SOLAR SYSTEMS FOR PUBLIC WORKS
In addition to the construction and maintenance of government buildings, the Ministry of 
Works, Urban Planning and Municipalities is responsible for public works, infrastructure and 
engineering covering: 
- Roads: Planning, design, supervision of construction and maintenance of roads, 
bridges, and traffic facilities.ingdom of Bahrain
nal Renewable Energy Action Plan
and maintenance of networks, treatment plants, pumping stations and treated 
sewage effluent systems.
Energy consumption makes up a large share of the Ministry’s expenditures, especially for the 
operation of water pumping stations. To make public works more efficient and sustainable, 
and to reduce the energy bill, the Ministry of Works, Urban Planning and Municipalities is 
committed to incorporate renewable energy sources in the design and engineering of public 
works and infrastructure. Preliminary identified initiatives include: 
- Implementing solar PV systems for water pumping stations; and
- Installation of solar powered street lighting systems. 
5.3 SOLAR SYSTEMS FOR NEW HOUSING UNITS
The Ministry of Housing is responsible for building affordable social housing units for the lowincome Bahraini households. The Ministry of Housing plans to develop 40,000 housing units 
in Bahrain’s four Governorates. The projects are planned to be funded under the government 
budget and GCC development program. The first 25,000 housing units will be built in the 
next four years.
The Ministry of Housing is committed to delivering cost-effective, efficient and quality 
housing. It is already implementing energy efficiency measures in housing units to comply 
with Bahrain building thermal insulation regulations. It has also started implementing 
experimental solar projects (solar water heaters).
To make houses more efficient and sustainable, the Ministry of Housing is committed to 
incorporate further renewable energy sources in the housing units (roof-top PV, building 
integrated PV, solar parking lots). This will help minimize the impact on the environment, 
improve air quality, reduce reliance on fossil fuel, and shave the energy peak demand 
during hot summer seasons, when the bulk of electricity demand is used for air-conditioning 
purposes.
The work will start with the initiation of demonstration projects in one of the new town 
developments. Upon delivery of the demonstration projects, capacity-building workshops 
will be organized for housing developers, architects, contractors, and installers, on lessons 
learned and on successful integration of renewables in the building design. This will be an 
opportunity to: 
- Increase confidence of building owners and the general public about solar PV as a 
viable energy technology;well as architects through learning-by doing;
- For Electricity and Water Authority, to test the integration of intermittent renewable 
resources into the electricity grid.
These lessons will be vital for the continued deployment of PV (and other renewable 
resources) in Bahrain.
5.4 RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS IN URBAN DEVELOPMENTS
Many of the new social housing units will be built in new town developments such as 
Northern City, Bahir, and Southern New Town. This presents an opportunity for the Ministry 
of Housing to incorporate renewable energy sources not only in the housing units, but also 
in the urban design. The Ministry of Housing has already started the process of integrating 
principles of sustainability in new town developments. One of such examples includes 
Southern New Town development in collaboration with the Prince Charles Foundation.
The Southern New Town development will have around 4,000 homes and will be built 
around principles of environmental and social sustainability. This includes minimizing the 
environmental impact of the urban environment; creating healthier living spaces for people; 
and promoting social dialogues through integrating creative solutions in the urban design 
and management. 
The sustainability strategy of the town plans seeks to incorporate renewable energy sources 
in the town development as a means to reduce reliance on fossil fuel, and minimize the 
impact on the environment. Two types of renewable energy initiatives are proposed: (1) 
community scale PV array to provide clean power to the future residents of the town; and 
(2) various decentralized renewable energy solutions integrated in the urban environment 
(solar roof tops, building integrated PV, solar street lighting, solar parking lots).To create more 
sustainable urban spaces, the Ministry of Housing in coordination with other Ministries, is 
committed to incorporating renewable energy initiatives in other new town developments.ingdom of Bahrain
nal Renewable Energy Action Plan
Economies of scale favor the development of large-scale renewable energy plants; therefore, 
it is prudent to consider deployment of such projects where land is available. A good example 
is the deployment of a solar farm on land that is otherwise not productive such as a closed 
landfill site. Askar landfill is the largest landfill site in Bahrain. Spread over an area of more 
than 300 hectares, the landfill is expected to reach its capacity in the next few years. The 
Askar landfill site mostly caters to solid municipal waste, agricultural waste, and industrial 
non-hazardous waste. Currently around 80-100 hectares of Askar landfill is full and closed. 
This parcel of land in general is not suitable for construction, or development of residential 
or commercial projects due to the risks associated with landfill sites (high concentration of 
toxic and hazardous materials posing serious health threats to people and pollutions risks to 
environment). 
One of the more successful ways of rehabilitating closed landfill sites is to turn them into solar 
fields to generate clean power for the residents of nearby towns and villages. Generation of 
solar power can be coupled with a landfill gas recovery project to enhance the utilization of 
the land and provide for more safety. This will not only minimize the environmental impact 
of the overall power generation system (by reducing greenhouse gas emissions), but also 
will make more economic use of the otherwise unproductive land parcel, and promote more 
sustainable development. Today there are many examples worldwide where landfill sites 
have been successfully turned into solar fields.29
The Ministry of Works, Municipality and Urban Planning is committed to promoting sustainable 
development in Bahrain, and strongly supports the rehabilitation of the closed landfill site 
in Askar, into a solar field to provide clean power to the residents of nearby towns, reduce 
reliance on fossil fuels for power generation, and contribute to shaving the energy peak 
demand during hot summer seasons.The Tubli Water Pollution Control Center (WPCC) is the largest municipal wastewater 
treatment plant in Bahrain serving most of the residential communities in the country. With 
the recently completed upgrade to the Tubli WPCC the plant treats approximately 304,000 m3 
of wastewater per day compared to the previous figure of 200,000 m3 per day. The treated 
effluent is partially used for irrigation and the surplus is discharged into the nearby Tubli bay, 
which is a protected natural reserve under both national and international legislation. 
On average more than 50 ton of dry solids (sludge) is produced at Tubli WPCC on a daily 
basis. Currently, there is no further process to treat the generated activated sludge from the 
Tubli WPCC; most sludge is sent to the landfill site for sanitary disposal. This amount of sludge 
presents an excellent opportunity to extract useful energy either through anaerobic digestion 
process (biogas) or other waste to energy solution such as pyrolysis. The extracted energy 
can be used to generate electricity to power the Tubli WPCC, thereby reducing electricity bill 
of the Tubli plant.
Recovering energy from sludge at the wastewater treatment plants will have a number of 
environmental benefits: 
- Avoid emission of greenhouse gas emissions by 89,000 tonnes of CO2 per year 
from landfilling the sludge
- Reduce volume of sludge to be landfilled, saving the landfill capacity
- Stabilization, sanitation and odor reduction 
- Generating renewable energy that can be used to power the Tubli WPCC.
5.7 RENEWABLE ENERGY PLANTS BY LARGE INDUSTRY GROUPS
Large industry groups are taking a lead in launching renewable energy projects to show their 
commitment in preserving the Kingdom’s natural resources and protecting the environment. 
One prominent example includes the recently commissioned Tatweer Petroleum’s 1 MW 
solar PV project. The new solar plant was commissioned in February 2016 with a total capital 
cost of USD 1.8 million30. It is connected to Tatweer’s own grid and delivers enough power 
to provide autonomy to its headquarters. After successful implementation of the first solar 
project Tatweer is looking into further deployment of solar PV plants with a more optimized 
cost structure. It is planning to install an additional 3-4 MW of solar PV capacity.ingdom of Bahrain
nal Renewable Energy Action Plan
projects to take advantage of its available large industrial roof areas. It has already approached 
the Sustainable Energy Unit for technical advice and assistance. Gulf Petrochemical Industries 
Company (GPIC) has been a pioneer of sustainability actions in Bahrain. As part of its 
sustainability program GPIC plans to expand the use of renewable energy projects at its 
premises in four phases, starting in 2014 and completing by 2019. It has already built a 10 
kWp solar water heating system, and is in the process of installing a 0.5 MW solar PV project. 
5.8NEAR SHORE AND OFFSHORE WIND FARMS
The assessment of preliminary wind data suggests the viability of taking formal steps to 
build a medium scale wind farm. The first wind farm can be used to demonstrate the 
technical and financial viability of such projects. In order to maintain a relatively reasonable 
LCOE and attract private developers, the government is considering a prefeasibility study for 
a wind farm with a capacity of around 50 MW (around 16 to 20 turbines). This process will 
be initiated after the publication of the comprehensive wind resource assessment map for 
the Kingdom of Bahrain. 
5.9 EWA RENEWABLE ENERGY INITIATIVE
To demonstrate commitment in renewable energy, EWA is developing Bahrain’s first 5 MW 
hybrid renewable energy system in Al Dur district. The project consists of a 3 MW solar PV 
system and a 2 MW wind turbine. EWA has already completed detailed technical studies 
and selected the successful contractor to perform engineering, design and installation of the 
power plant. The construction of the project is expected to start in 2017. A number of factors must come together to ensure that the National Renewable Energy 
Action Plan effectively transitions from a desk document, to actions that capitalize on the 
potential benefits described: 
- A governance structure that provides guidance and executive sponsorship; 
- Incorporation of renewable energy initiatives in ministries’ action plans and work 
programs; 
- Developing tools enabling deployment of renewable energy initiatives; 
- Identifying funding opportunities for projects and activities. 
An effective energy governance structure is critical to implementation of the National 
Renewable Energy Plan. Current roles within government structures can be utilized and 
built upon to support good governance.
6.1 GOVERNANCE 
An effective energy governance structure is critical to implementation of the National 
Renewable Energy Plan. Current roles within government structures can be utilized and 
built upon to support good governance.
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY UNIT 
SEU is the designated agency for promoting sustainable energy policies and practices in 
the Kingdom of Bahrain. As such SEU will lead the coordination efforts in implementing 
the NREAP, and will provide technical assistance in the deployment of renewable energy 
projects.
Responsibilities:
- Coordinate implementation activities among all stakeholders through developing 
partnerships and organizing regular coordination meetings.
- Inform stakeholders on the progress of implementation of the NREAP.
- Draft renewable energy policy regulations and support the establishment of 
standard operating procedures for their implementation.
- Carry out feasibility studies, resource potential assessment, cost-benefit analysis 
of various technology options and business modelsas well as overseeing the ingdom of Bahrain

for proposals, evaluating bids, and assessing outcomes of pilot projects.
- Carry out information dissemination and awareness raising campaigns through 
launching a dedicated website, organizing press conferences, promoting renewable 
energy at various public events.
- Organize and support capacity building and training activities for government and 
non-government stakeholders.
NREAP IMPLEMENTATION FOLLOW-UP COMMITTEE
The Committee will be composed of high-level representatives of key government and nongovernment institutions who would play the role of change agents to provide guidance, 
support and oversight of the implementation process of NREAP. The Committee will be 
chaired by the Minister of Electricity and Water Affairs and may include representatives from 
the Electricity and Water Authority, the Ministry of Finance, the Office of the First Deputy 
Prime Minister, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry 
of Works, Urban Planning and Municipalities, the Ministry of Oil, and the Supreme Council for 
Environment. The Committee will meet on a quarterly basis.
Responsibilities:
- Oversee implementation of the NREAP and facilitate its execution;
- Identify action items to overcome implementation issues and challenges;
- Put recommendations and suggest actions to relevant ministries;
- Decide on making changes in the NREAP if required;
- Discuss the progress in the implementation process. 
SEU will assist in preparing the agenda of the meeting, the minutes, including the action list; 
the progress report on the status of the implementation process since the last meeting; and 
any other documents to be discussed or considered during the meeting.To demonstrate leadership and ensure successful development of renewable energy 
it is important that individual Ministries and government institutions incorporate 
renewable energy initiatives in their action plans and work programs. 
This will reinforce the role of the government as the leader in sustainability actions 
and make renewable energy technologies more visible to people and businesses. 
It will also allow government staff to build expertise and training with technologies 
(purchasing, installation, suppliers, options, operation, maintenance, economics), 
and aid in further development and improvement of renewable energy policies.
6.3 TOOLS ENABLING RENEWABLE ENERGY
To further aid the successful development of renewable energy systems, SEU in collaboration 
with other research and think-tank institutions will provide and develop on continuous basis, 
information, evidence based research, and tools to support the deployment of renewable 
energies. Such activities include: 
- Developing proof of concept tasks to demonstrate feasibility and economic viability 
of various renewable energy initiatives through cost-benefit analysis and pilot 
projects;
- Providing guidance on various technologies and building a stronger case for 
adoption of renewables;
- Conducting resource potential assessment of new renewable energy sources and 
identifying potential technical, economic, regulatory and institutional barriers;
- Streamlining regulatory and administrative procedures;
- Providing benchmarking, reporting, education, and capacity building activities.ingdom of Bahrain
nal Renewable Energy Action Plan
A key factor in advancing renewable energy systems is the capability to fund renewable 
energy initiatives. There are two types of activities that require funding: 
(1) Funding for deployment of renewable energy systems; and 
(2) Funding to carry out other activities enabling deployment of renewable energy 
systems.
Deployment of renewable energy systems requires significant capital funding. These can 
come from private sector and public sector. The current Plan proposes three policies that are 
aimed at attracting private investment in renewable energy projects: (1) Net Metering; (2) 
Tender-based Feed-in Tariff; and (3) Renewable Energy Mandate for New Buildings. 
Funding requirements for activities enabling the deployment of renewable energy projects 
such as capacity building, resource potential assessment, or feasibility studies are less capital 
intensive, but more difficult to source from private sector. Many countries have established 
clean energy funds to support research, development and demonstration of renewable 
energy technologies. These funds are often financed either through direct allocation of funds 
from government budget, private and public donations, or tax proceeds. 
SEU will investigate best practices on setting up such fund and will develop a proposal for the 
establishment of the Bahrain clean energy fund, to support the research, development, and 
demonstration of renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives. In additional, funding 
from global clean energy financing mechanisms and global financial institutions will also be 
explored.This section presents the top ten actions to set the Plan into motion. Some of these are 
fundamental activities that should be implemented quickly to enable further progress, 
others have already begun and are in the process of implementation. A few actions are large 
impact, multi-stakeholder projects that require attention, or additional research in order to 
deliver longer term results. The top ten actions are set out below:
- Develop and approve net metering regulations; 
- Develop and approve the grid code, and necessary technical guidelines for smallscale solar PV systems; 
- Designate 50-100 government buildings with large roof/parking lot areas for the 
private development of solar PV systems through the tender-based feed-in tariff 
scheme;
- Based on available wind speed data compile a detailed wind atlas for Bahrain;
- Launch a feasibility study on integrating renewable energy sources in large 
infrastructure projects such as causeways; 
- Designate a batch of new housing units to implement solar PV systems as 
demonstration projects;
- Designate Askar landfill site for the development of the large-scale solar PV farm;
- Explore the possibility of extracting energy from sludge at the wastewater treatment 
plants;
- Launch a prefeasibility study for offshore wind power generation; 
- Launch a pilot waste to energy project.ingdom of Bahrain
