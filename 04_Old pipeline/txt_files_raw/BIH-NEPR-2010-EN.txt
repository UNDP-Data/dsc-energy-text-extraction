A) Energy Resources 
EEJ: June 2010Country Report – Bosnia and Herzegovina / JICA JFY 
Bosnia and Herzegovina has available significant reserves of lignite and brown coal usable for generation of electricity applying existing (classic) technology or through new energy combustion and transformation technologies.The existing TPPs in BiH consume average annually around 8 mil.tons of appropriate types and qualities of coal, that surely must be supplied until the end of the existing TPPs lifetime.Estimates are that aggregate coal reserves in BiH amount: a) Brown Coal 1.886 mil.tonsb) Lignite 3.578 mil.tons
Total 5.464 mil.tons.
This is preconditions for long-run coal supply to the existing TPPs and for construction of new ones as well. When doing so, there must be taken care of optimal choice of new boilers in thermal power plants according to realistically available qualities and structures of coals.

Bosnia and Herzegovina's geography includes fast-flowing mountain streams and powerful rivers that are very well suited for hydroelectricity production. Currently, hydroelectric power stations exist with a generating capacity of around 6,500 MW. Most of these installations are more than 30 years old; modernization of the existing plants is in the pipeline. In 2007 Bosnia generated 6,140 GWh of hydroelectricity, which was a 5 percent generation increase from the previous year (EIA, 2006).It is estimated that Bosnia has a hydropower potential of 23,400 GWh. Most of the potential is located within the Drina, Neretva and Trebisnjica river basins. The Drina River alone is estimated to have a power generating potential of about 6,000 GWh.

mall Hydros Bosnia has an estimated small 
dro power potential of 2,500 GWh/yr., what is the 
otential to support app. 356 large and small 
droelectric power stations. Since 2006, a total of 
20 licenses have been issued for new mini 
droelectric power stations; mini hydroelectric 
ower stations have capacities not in excess of 10 
W.
Wind A wind atlas for Bosnia and Herzegovina 
as recently established. The assessment shows 
at Bosnia and Herzegovina has significant wind 
otential. It is estimated that the total wind power 
otential capacity is about 2,000 MW, but only 900 
W are usable. This potential has not yet been 
ploited. 
olar The solar irradiation values in Bosnia and 
erzegovina vary accordingly with about 1,240 
Wh/m2 in the northern region to 1,600 kWh/m2 in 
e southern region. In the southern region, the 
mount of sunny days can get up to about 270 days 
er year. The solar potential of the region is 
pproximately 1,900 TWh. 
eothermal energy According to available 
ata, Bosnia & Herzegovina has a geothermal 
otential of 33 MWth. Due to the low temperatures, 
owever, current activities relating to geothermal 
ergy continue to be limited to exploitation for 
ermal use.

arket is covered by small private distributors. 
he demand for motor fuels on the domestic 
arket in the present conditions is approximately 
5 million tons annually. The oil refinery delivers 
ound 500,000 tons to the market, and the rest 
imported. Considering that the number of 
vate petrol stations is on the increase and has 
ached approximately 300 stations, objective 
timates suggest that the commercial capacities

eliminary investigations have proved significant 
l reserves in BiH.
as All natural gas is imported from the 
ussian Federation and is transported to BiH via 
e gas transport systems in Ukraine, Hungary 
d Yugoslavia. Due to the above mentioned 
ost-war dissolution of the energy system, BiH is 
cing an absurd situation – in the entire gas 
ansport (over 5000 km) from the gas wells in 
beria to Sarajevo (which is the main consumer 
BiH) the intermediaries involved in the internal 
ansport of gas in BiH outnumber the transport 
ermediaries up to the BiH border. The main 
atures of the gas system in BiH are: length of 
91 km and the projected annual capacities of 1 
lion m3. The existing leased transport 
pacities to BiH are 750 million m3/year.
