In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate 
Vision for Afghanistan 
By the solar year 1400 (2020), Afghanistan will be: 
 A stable Islamic constitutional democracy at peace with itself and its neighbors, standing 
with full dignity in the international family. 
 A tolerant, united, and pluralist nation that honors its Islamic heritage and deep 
aspirations toward participation, justice, and equal rights for all. 
 A society of hope and prosperity based on a strong, private sector-led market economy, 
social equity, and environmental sustainability. 
ANDS Goals for 1387-1391 (2008-2013) 
The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) is a Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs)-based plan that serves as Afghanistan’s Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). It is underpinned by the principles, pillars and 
benchmarks of the Afghanistan Compact. The pillars and goals of the ANDS are: 
1. Security: Achieve nationwide stabilization, strengthen law enforcement, and improve 
personal security for every Afghan. 
2. Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights: Strengthen democratic practice and 
institutions, human rights, the rule of law, delivery of public services and government 
accountability. 
3. Economic and Social Development: Reduce poverty, ensure sustainable development 
through a private sector-led market economy, improve human development indicators, 
and make significant progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.  For the preparation of the Afghanistan National Development Strategy 
Foreword In the name of Allah, the most Merciful, the most Compassionate 
Six and half years ago, the people of Afghanistan and the international community joined hands to 
liberate Afghanistan from the grip of international terrorism and begin the journey to rebuild a nation 
stunned by a long past of violence, destruction and terror. We have come a long way in this shared 
journey. 
In just a few years, as a result of the partnership between Afghanistan and the international community, 
we were able to draw up a new, Constitution, embracing the values of democracy, freedom of speech 
and equal rights for women. Afghans voted in their first ever presidential elections and elected a new 
parliament. Close to five million Afghan refugees have returned home, making it one of the largest 
movement of people to their homeland in history. 
Thousands of schools have been built; over six million boys and girls have been enrolled, the highest 
level ever for Afghanistan. Hundreds of health clinics have been established boosting our basic health 
coverage from 9 percent six years ago to over 85 percent today. Access to diagnostic and curative services 
has increased from almost none in 2002 to more than forty percent now. We have rehabilitated 12,200 km 
of roads. Our rapid economic growth, with double digit growth almost every year, has led to higher 
income and better living conditions for our people. With a developing network of roads and a state-ofthe-art communications infrastructure, Afghanistan is better placed to serve as an economic land-bridge 
in our region. 
These achievements would not have been possible without the unwavering support of the 
international community and the strong determination of the Afghan people. I hasten to point out 
that our achievements should not make us complacent distracting to face the enormity of the tasks 
that are still ahead. The threat of terrorism and the menace of narcotics are still affecting Afghanistan 
and the broader region and hampering our development. Our progress is still undermined by the 
betrayal of public trust by some functionaries of the state and uncoordinated and inefficient aid 
delivery mechanisms. Strengthening national and sub-national governance and rebuilding our 
judiciary are also among our most difficult tasks. 
To meet these challenges, I am pleased to present Afghanistan’s National Development Strategy 
(ANDS). This strategy has been completed after two years of hard work and extensive consultations 
around the country. As an Afghan-owned blueprint for the development of Afghanistan in all spheres 
of human endeavor, the ANDS will serve as our nation’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. I am 
confident that the ANDS will help us in achieving the Afghanistan Compact benchmarks and 
Millennium Development Goals. I also consider this document as our roadmap for the long-desired 
objective of Afghanization, as we transition towards less reliance on aid and an increase in selfsustaining economic growth. 
I thank the international community for their invaluable support. With this Afghan-owned strategy, I 
ask all of our partners to fully support our national development efforts. I am strongly encouraged to 
see the participation of the Afghan people and appreciate the efforts of all those in the international 
community and Afghan society who have contributed to the development of this strategy. Finally, I 
thank the members of the Oversight Committee and the ANDS Secretariat for the preparation of this 
document. 
Hamid Karzai 
President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan  For the preparation of the Afghanistan National Development Strategy 
Message from the Oversight 
Committee In the name of Allah, the most Merciful, the most Compassionate 
We are pleased to present the Afghanistan National Development Strategy, which reflects the 
commitment of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to poverty reduction and private sector-led 
economic growth for a prosperous and stable Afghanistan. The ANDS Oversight Committee (OSC) 
was mandated by the Government to produce a Millennium Development Goals-based national 
strategy that is Afghan-owned and meets the requirements for a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. 
The OSC met on a regular basis to design, discuss and oversee the development of the strategy, 
including the identification of the needs and grievances of the people, and the prioritization of 
resource allocations and actions. To embrace ‘Afghanization” and ownership, the OSC facilitated 
inclusive and extensive consultations both at national and sub-national levels. 
Sustained fiscal support and continuous evaluation and monitoring are essential now to meet the 
challenges ahead related to ANDS implementation. The democratic aspirations of the Afghan people 
are high, yet financial resources remain limited. While much has been accomplished since 2001, more 
remains to be done as we move from “Compact to Impact”. The Afghan Government with support 
from the international community must act decisively, strategically, and with an absolute 
commitment to the ANDS goals and vision. 
We look forward to working with our government colleagues, civil society representatives, tribal 
elders and religious scholars, the private sector, the international community and, most importantly, 
fellow Afghans to implement the ANDS, to help realize the Afghanistan Compact benchmarks and 
Millennium Development Goals.

SUMMARY 
ENERGY SECTOR STRATEGY
Afghanistan’s energy sector and its economy 
are at a crossroads. Energy, abundantly and 
cost effectively supplied, can be a very 
important input in the sustainable 
development of Afghanistan. However, 
energy is no panacea. In fact, if it is supplied 
imprudently, instead being a vehicle for 
growth, it will pull down the Government’s 
development efforts and be a drag on 
economic growth. Capital investment in 
energy is rising rapidly attesting to the efforts 
to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (IROA) 
and the donor community. At the same time 
though, the efficiency of energy operations is 
not increasing. If left unchecked, much of the 
investment that is being made will be wasted. 
To illustrate this gravity of the problem, the 
cost of losses has been estimated. Because of 
the state of the infrastructure and the familiar 
short comings of Government owned and 
operated energy provision, losses are 
enormous. Losses in 2005 amounted US$ 
128.5 million. 
 
Figure 1. Annual Impact of Poor Commercial 
Operations and Subsidies 
The actual cost to the economy is greater! 
What this highlights is that continuing to 
operate on a business as usual basis is 
unsustainable. The number one priority in the 
energy sector must be on operating efficiency: 
commercialization of DABM, investments in 
transmission and distribution to reduce losses, 
and, repair and maintenance of all power 
assets. Moreover, it is important to focus now 
on efficient use of energy and the enabling 
policy, legal and regulatory frameworks 
should address this issue. 
When this is considered against the Afghan 
Compact Goals, the importance of efficiency 
becomes even more important. By 2010 the 
number of connections to meet the AC goals 
will rise by 211 percent while capacity will 
increase only 194%, assuming that imports go 
according to plan. This means that unless 
there are changes in efficiency, the average 
kWh consumed per connection must go down. 
This is not a recipe for economic growth. 
Compounding the problem and not included 
in this analysis are that the demand for power 
will actually rise and that with more 
connections the cost of un-served energy will 
rise. While it is imperative that additional 
infrastructure be added, it is even more 
important that the IROA focus on efficiency. 
While much can be done by the Government, 
the real solution lies in creating and expanding 
a meaningful role for the private sector. 
Realizing that the Afghan economy is starved 
of reliable and cost effective energy, the 
immediate task of the IROA, with assistance 
from the Donor community, is then to provide 
energy to those that can use best use and pay 
for it (and that may well be business), in the 
quantities and quality that they need, at a 
price that covers cost (for all but the poorest 
members of society), and to do so in the most 
cost effective manner. At the same time 
though, it must begin to take steps that will 
provide a solid footing for the transition of the 
sector from Government provision to Private 
Sector provision. This strategy acknowledges 
that there are many steps that need to be taken on the road to fully involving the private 
sector. It will begin with changes in policy 
and laws and involvement of the private 
sector in rural energy provision and in 
outsourcing at DABM. It is a gradual process 
that will be enhanced by a deliberate process 
of reform. 
The availability of secure energy supplies 
within Afghanistan was significantly 
disrupted by the conflicts of the past two 
decades. Post-conflict efforts by the Islamic 
Republic of Afghanistan (IROA) and 
international donors to date have focused on 
expanding the availability of energy resources 
throughout the country. Particular emphasis 
has been on expanding and rehabilitating the 
electricity sector in the major economic hubs of 
the country and providing basic service in 
rural areas. Efforts also have been taken to 
improve the supply of natural gas, increase 
availability of hydro-electric generation, 
rehabilitate and expand electricity and natural 
gas transmission and distribution systems, 
develop renewable energy resources in rural 
and remote areas, increase low-cost power 
imports and improve the capability of energy 
sector institutions. 
Since 2001, Afghanistan energy efforts have 
focused on “bailing out the boat” or keeping 
the lights on and providing heat in the winter. 
At some point, one must also focus on 
stopping the flow of water before they become 
exhausted. The short term focused activities 
alone can continue only so long before the 
long term growth path of the country is 
adversely impacted. Having achieved 
moderate success in these areas, the time is 
ripe to review current activities and programs 
and place greater emphasis on behalf of the 
IROA and donors on a more long-range, 
sustainable future for the energy sector. This 
would include balancing on-going efforts to 
rehabilitate and expand energy resources with 
a longer-term strategy for the sector. 
The Afghan Energy Strategy contains an 
implicit prioritization of energy sub-sector 
activities. Electricity is given far greater 
preference or priority than other sectors 
because modern economies are built on 
electricity. Priority is then assigned to other 
sub-sectors based on their supporting role in 
electricity and in overall economic activity. In 
practical terms this means that MoM and 
MoCI need to prioritize their policies, 
programs and projects towards the production 
of fuels for electricity generation. The strategy 
is based on five3 prongs or pillars. 
1. Increased Efficiency in Existing 
Operation: At this time, it is easier, faster 
and cheaper to gain a megawatt of power 
from increasing efficiency than from 
building a new generating plant. For 
example, for every US $5 the Government 
spends in providing compact fluorescent 
light bulbs, it actually saves US $51 and 49 
watts. 
2. Improved Sector Governance and PublicPrivate Partnership Promotion1: The 
ultimate success of the energy sector 
depends critically on mobilizing the 
private sector. This can begin now with 
establishing a multi-sector regulator, 
looking to outsource at State Owned 
Enterprises, preparing the enabling legal, 
policy and regulatory infrastructure for 
business, and the commercialization of 
SOEs. 
3. Improved Coordination and Capacity 
Development: Additionally, coordination 
among the Government entities must 
increase and coordination between the 
Government and the Donor community 
must likewise be strengthened. Assistance 
needs to be given to ICE to strengthen its 
capacity. An integrated energy master 
plan is required to serve as a road map for 
the Government and Donors alike. To 
accomplish this, capacity must be 
significantly strengthened and training is 
an imperative 
4. Rural Energy versus Rural Electrification: 
Most rural Afghans are unable to pay for 
expensive electricity. Energy is required 
for growth but energy alone won’t do the 
job. The role of rural energy to seek out 
opportunities for economic activities that 
lack energy, that will pay for energy and 
thereby subsidize rural energy 
 
1 Clearly there is overlap between pillars 1 and 2. 
Increased efficiency will in some part necessitate 
improved Governance and the ultimate efficiency gains 
will be possible only with private provision. These 
commonalities notwithstanding, these two areas are 
difft ithijfconsumption while raising rural incomes 
at the same time. 
5. Expanded or New Supply: Investments in 
new capacity or energy infrastructure: A 
lot of progress has been made, but not 
enough, in creating new supply. It is time 
now that the Government and Donor 
community can consider alternative 
supplies such as wind energy or reducing 
consumption alongside the more 
traditional methods. New supply must be 
rationalized and efforts focused on a few 
large projects such as the North East 
Power System. 
These are the pillars of Afghanistan’s near 
term energy strategy. Alongside addressing 
the immediate and short term needs, it is 
imperative that the country look to longer 
term issues. Because it is building its energy 
infrastructure anew, it can learn from the 
lessons of experience in other countries. It can 
focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy 
and decentralized energy. If it does this at the 
same time it builds its industrial base, then the 
benefits are enormous. Thus, while a national 
grid is important to transport power from 
cheaper markets, it will prove more beneficial 
in the long run to focus on decentralized 
power. A recent British study concluded that 
61 percent of the energy value of the primary 
fuel disappears. “Another 4 percent vanished 
in transmission.” This means that roughly 
two thirds of the energy is lost in a centralized 
system. By locating power generation closer 
to users, these losses can be significantly 
reduced. Thus, the long term strategy will 
increasingly focus on cogeneration, distributed 
power, renewable and end-use efficiency as 
well as the more traditional areas. 
The strategy is focused on poverty reduction 
through all its five pillars. First, by improving 
operating efficiency, the drain on government 
resources is reduced. More is available for 
other programs. Similarly, by focusing on 
end-use efficiency, the drain on the customer’s 
resources is reduced. More of their income is 
available for other things. Second, improving 
sector governance will also have a significant 
impact on poverty. It will bring about better 
subsidy mechanisms so that the subsidy is 
targeted to those that need it the best way 
possible. While it will reduce the overall level 
of subsidy in the sector but the neediest 
members of society will have access to energy 
at subsidized rates. Moreover, every Afghani 
of subsidy that can be freed up in this sector 
can be used in other sectors. Third, this 
strategy reorients rural energy to focus on 
income generating activities. Thus, by 
definition this is a poverty reduction activity. 
Fourth, the economy is starved for energy. 
The fifth pillar is the investment in new energy 
supply and the economy can’t grow without 
energy; poverty can’t be reduced in 
Afghanistan without economic growth. 
Finally, the combined impact of these policies, 
programs and projects will be more energy 
supplied more efficiently and reliably. This is 
a solid prescription for economic growth, 
which growth is important for poverty 
reduction.INTRODUCTION 
Energy, abundantly and cost effectively 
supplied, is an important input in the 
sustainable development of Afghanistan. It is 
a necessary but not sufficient condition for 
economic growth. Energy provided cost 
effectively in sufficient quantity and quality on 
a sustainable basis will support economic 
development and employment; help reduce 
poverty; contribute to social and political 
stability both within Afghanistan and 
regionally; improve living standards; and 
contribute to a reduction in environmental 
impacts. Energy alone, though, is no panacea 
to Afghanistan’s problems. In fact, if it is 
supplied imprudently, instead being a vehicle 
for growth, it will drag down the 
Government’s development efforts and be a 
drag on economic growth. 
Realizing that the Afghan economy is starved 
of reliable and cost effective energy, the 
immediate task of the IROA, with assistance 
from the Donor community, is then to (1) 
provide energy to those that can use best use 
and pay for it, (2) in the quantities and quality 
that they need, (3) at a price that covers cost 
(for all but the poorest members of society), 
and (4) to do so in the most cost effective 
manner. At the same time though, it must 
begin to take steps that will provide a solid 
footing for the transition of the sector from 
Government provision to Private Sector 
provision. 
The availability of secure energy supplies was 
significantly disrupted by the conflicts of the 
past two decades. Post-conflict efforts by the 
Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (IROA) and 
international donors have focused on 
expanding the availability of energy resources 
throughout the country. Emphasis has been on 
expanding and rehabilitating the electricity 
sector in the major economic hubs of the 
country and providing basic service in rural 
areas. Efforts also have been taken to improve 
the supply of natural gas, increase availability 
of hydro-electric generation, rehabilitate and 
expand electricity transmission distribution 
system, develop renewable energy resources 
in rural and remote areas, increase low-cost 
power imports and improve the capability of 
energy sector institutions. 
Since 2001, Afghanistan energy efforts have 
focused on “bailing out the boat” or keeping 
the lights on and providing heat in the winter. 
The short term focused activities alone can 
continue only so long before the long term 
growth path of the country is adversely 
impacted. Having achieved moderate success 
in these areas, the time is ripe to review 
current activities and programs and place 
greater emphasis on behalf of the IROA and 
donors on a more long-range, sustainable 
future for the energy sector. This would 
include balancing on-going efforts to 
rehabilitate and expand energy resources with 
a longer-term strategy for the sector. 
To illustrate this gravity of the problem, the 
cost of losses has been estimated. Because of 
the state of the infrastructure and the familiar 
short comings of Government owned and 
operated energy provision, losses are 
enormous. Total losses is 40% (Technical 23% 
and 17% commercial) where as in a reasonable 
system they would be on the order of 10%. 
This 20% loss of energy equates to a 
substantial financial drain. In 2005, 
Afghanistan produced and imported 1,162.3 
Gwh of power2. If 20% of this is lost, this 
means 232.5 MWH and at $0.12 per kWh3, the 
cost of these losses amounts to $27.9 million 
annually. To this must be added the cost of 
subsidies, or $56 million a year. Finally, there 
are commercial losses. This covers everything 
from theft to that the fact that (1) not all power 
sold is billed and (2) not all power billed is 
collected. Collections are 60% of billing. It can 
safely be assumes that total losses are 40% 
(23% technical and 17% commercial), or 371.9 
mWh for a cost of $44.6 million. This is 
dramatically illustrated in the following 
figure. 
 
2 AEIC website 2005 electricity production. 
3 S
MEW PStSttThe total cost of losses and subsidies equaled 
$128.5 million in 2005. The actual cost to the 
economy is greater! What this highlights is 
that continuing to operate on a business as 
usual basis is unsustainable. The number one 
priority in the energy sector must be on 
efficiency: commercialization of DABM, 
investments in transmission and distribution 
to reduce losses, repair and maintenance of all 
power assets. Changing business as usual also 
means changing how subsidies are provided. 
For example, if DABM provided each 
connection with one CFL to replace one 
incandescent bulb at the manufacturers cost of 
$5, it would save 38.8 thousand mwh per year 
in generation and reduce its losses by $US 3 
million per year. It would cost DABM only 
$1.2 million to change out the bulbs, a rate of 
return of 17% and the bulb program would 
pay for itself in 2.5 years. Beyond the financial 
rewards, this is the easiest way to reduce 
commercial losses and make more power 
available. This is equivalent to a 38.8 MW 
boost in power with no additional investment 
and in a very short time frame. A 38.8 MW 
power plant would cost on the order of $40 
million. 
Figure 2. Annual Impact of poor commercial 
operations and subsidies 
The IROA will continue to rely on energy from 
diversified sources. However, modern 
economies are driven by electricity and the 
paramount objective in jump starting 
Afghanistan’s energy sector and its economy 
is to give priority to electricity and then 
transportation fuels. In rural areas, it means 
linking income generating activities to energy 
and this means providing a slate of energy 
supply options. This will mean a great deal of 
coordination among ministries and agencies 
and it may mean subordinating one Ministries 
plans to that of another. This report provides 
an overview of Afghanistans energy sector 
highlighting basic elements and issues and 
then offers an Energy Sector Strategy to 
address these issues over the next 2-to-10 year 
period. 
Importance of Energy for Economic 
Development 
The goal of the Afghanistan Energy Sector 
Strategy is to deliver sufficient energy to 
support economic growth of about 9% per 
annum,4 which in turn will help lower 
poverty by 3% a year5 and to do so in the most 
cost effective manner. In accordance with the 
AC, this is translated into the following sector 
specific goals. 
By end-2010: electricity will reach at least 
65% of households and 90% of nonresidential establishments in major urban 
areas and at least 25% of households in 
rural areas; at least 75% of the costs will be 
recovered from users connected 
to the national power grid. A strategy for the 
development and use of renewable energies 
 will be developed by end-2007.” 
Economic growth that raises incomes and 
reduces poverty is strongly correlated with 
increased energy use. Energy is used in the 
production process of every sector of the 
economy. The provision of adequate and 
reliable energy services at affordable and costbased prices, in a secure and environmentally 
sustainable manner, and in conformity with 
social and economic development needs, is an 
essential element of sustainable development. 
A sufficient supply of energy is a vital input 
for eradicating poverty, improving human 
welfare and raising living standards. The 
correlation between commercial energy and 
development is aptly shown in Figure 3 where 
per capita GDP is measured against per capita 
energy consumption. If Afghanistan is to 
grow and take its place among industrializing 
nations, then it must have more electricity, 
 
4 This has been the Government’s growth goal for the 
economy since 1383 (2004) (See: Securing Afghanistan’s 
Future), and is estimated to be sufficient growth to build 
a legal economy while eliminating illicit the trade 
without causing devastating poverty.

hitCt bhkpetroleum products, and natural gas. Modern 
economies require modern fuels. 
Correlation does not imply causation and 
adequate supply of commercial energy is a 
necessary but not sufficient condition for 
economic growth. Economies can’t grow 
without commercial energy but simply 
providing more energy to an economy does 
not guarantee growth. What this means for 
the Energy Sector Strategy is that energy must 
often be combined with other interventions. 
Providing adequate, cost effective energy 
supplies to an area where there is commercial 
and/or industrial activity, may lower costs 
and allow things to be done. This in turn will 
create jobs and expand the economy. Jobs will 
include those in the sector; for example, 
miners, electrical workers and oil rig workers 
as well as those in industries set up because 
energy was available. However, supplying 
the same energy to an area where there are 
few economic activities is no panacea. In that 
case, energy supply must be coupled with 
economic activity if it is to be effective and 
sustainable.

The overwhelming majority of the population 
of Afghanistan lives in rural and remote areas. 
Over the medium to long term is where 
energy investments and policy reforms can 
make the greatest impact in reducing poverty, 
improving the quality of life, and supporting 
achievement of the ANDS cross-cutting goals. 
A priority effort in this regard will be to 
conduct a comprehensive energy needs and 
consumption survey to support more focused 
and effective delivery mechanisms for rural 
projects. Figure 4: Energy-Poverty Framework
highlights goals, impacts and outcomes, as 
they relate to the energy-poverty nexus. 
Figure 4. Energy Poverty Framework 
1 Leveraging Donor Support 
 Since 2002, Government has worked with 
donors to assess sector needs and has 
developed a power sector master plan 
(2003-04), gas sector master plan (2004-05), 
and renewable energy plan (2006). These require continued updating but have 
provided foundation information. 
 Donors have contributed to rehabilitation 
of the power grid, millions $USD funding 
for diesel fuel and support of more than 
1700 small renewable energy projects. 
 Since 2006, some commercialization of 
operations in power. 
2 Sector Governance and Institutional 
Reform 
 Establishment of the Inter-Ministerial 
Commission for Energy (ICE) in 2006 to 
coordinate government policy in energy, 
leverage donor resources and integrate 
sector planning. 
 Establishment of Cadastre , 
monitoring/evaluation and environment 
maintenance departments to better 
implement/organize gas/petroleum and 
minerals agreements and environment 
preservation. 
 Cabinet approval of Minerals Law,; under 
review by Parliament according to plans 
envisaged; Mineral Regulations is in the 
process of drafting and review. 
 Cabinet approval of Hydrocarbon Law, 
Hydrocarbon Regulations draft has been 
under review by MoJ. 
 Gas Law is in the process of drafting 
3 Promotion of regional energy linkages
 Afghanistan signed as a member of the 
Central Asia South Asia (CASA) 1000MW 
project November 2007. 
 Power purchase agreements (PPA) in the 
process for regular power imports from 
Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and 
Tajikistan; new PPA agreements being 
negotiated for increased power imports. 
 Ongoing Afghan participation in the 
Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India 
(TAPI) natural gas pipeline 
1 Sector Governance. Existing governance 
arrangements are inherently flawed to 
support a market-based energy system. 
The inadequacy of sector governance will 
continue to provide areas for imprudent 
practices andif left unchangedthe 
financial, resource and environmental 
consequences could be devastating for 
long-term development of the sector. 
 Dispersed institutional support. Seven 
ministries include energy as part of their 
portfolio. In addition national programs 
such as the National Environmental 
Protection Agency, Civil Service Reform 
and ANDS contribute to how sector policy 
is being developed. The institutional, 
regulatory and legal framework under 
which Afghanistan’s energy market 
currently functions is insufficient and in 
the absence of these frameworks makes 
virtually every aspect of sector operations 
vulnerable to corruption. 
 No legal or regulatory regime is in place 
(energy law is under preparation) to guide 
sector operations; there are no legal 
professionals trained in commercial 
energy law or regulatory processes. 
 Entrenched way of doing business. A strong 
legacy of central planning that has not 
sufficiently shifted where government is 
regulator and policy-maker while private 
sector implements sector activities has not 
transpired. The sector is particularly 
challenged with the need to rebuild a 
market structure on-top of a well 
developed system of informal networks 
and institutions that have operated as a 
‘shadow state’ over the course of more 
than two decades of conflict. While the 
Modern market-based procurement and 
public administration is essential for 
sector development. 
 No divesting or meaningful commercialization 
of state energy assets. Government and 
energy enterprise operations are 
overstaffed and highly inefficient, lacking 
fundamental tools and capacity to support 
technically and commercially viable 
operations. These include power, natural 
gas, coal and liquid fuels. Upon close 
review, some of the state owned 
enterprises and budgetary units operate 
with considerable government support 
and virtually no audit, fiscal or legal 
oversight.
2 Prioritization of sector actions. 
Government faces considerable challenge in maintaining and operating the existing system 
while simultaneously seeking to expand and 
improve operations. Provinces seek to develop 
their own energy priorities, an astounding 
lack of spare parts, virtually no metering of 
power use and no health and safety 
equipment for workers results in a primitive 
setting where quality improvements simply 
can not be achieved. Prioritizing where to start 
presents considerable challenge. 
3 Funding/Capital Investment. 
Reconstitution of the Afghan energy system 
and expansion of same will require billions of 
US$ over the course of years. Absent private 
investment, government cannot sustain the 
investments required to ensure a technically 
sound system. Government must leverage 
currently available donor funds to ensure 
longer term access to private investment and 
capital. Policies to support private investments 
must be established. Improved procurement, 
accounting functions, contracting and 
reporting at the government level is not 
sufficiently in place to support sound 
investment. 
Sub-National Consultations and PDPs 
Integration 
This Sector Strategy incorporates feedback 
and comments from the Sub National 
Consultations (SNCs) and as such is a 
response to the people of Afghanistan’s 
vocalized needs and development goals, 
both nationally and with provincial 
emphasis. Projects identified and 
prioritized during the SNC process are 
included in the Energy Strategy (for 
details of provincial priorities refer to 
annex IV): 
Energy and Poverty Reduction and Economic 
Growth 
The Energy sector of Afghanistan has the 
potential to drive urban and rural economic 
growth for years to come. Energy as a 
commodity can provide essential supply service 
that indirectly helps to create employment. 
Energy is purchased by consumers to power 
equipment, facilities and manufacturing 
processes that generate income. Energy as a 
business can create direct employment in the 
development of power plants, oil, gas and coal 
fields, the construction of grid systems and the 
commercial operations of the sector. For the 
rural poor, small energy installations are 
highly successful in cost-recovery and 
contribute to local economic development. 
Through improved sector governance and 
increased private sector participation, 
budgetary resources may be improved at the 
national and provincial levels. In addition, as 
sector governance improves, poor and 
marginalized populations will have increased 
opportunity to learn about energy 
developments that may benefit from them. 
Energy as a service can have dramatic impact on 
urban and rural health, social well being, 
security and other quality of life aspects. Basic 
street lighting provides security; refrigeration 
and cooling for medical supplies and home 
light and heat for improved family living, 
schooling and comfort. Increased attention to 
energy use can result in improved energy 
resource and environmental stewardship 
throughout the country. CHAPTER I 
CURRENT STATE OF THE ENERGY SECTOR
THE STATE OF THE 
OVERALL ENERGY SECTOR 
As mentioned earlier, modern economies 
demand energy and there is a strong direct 
relationship between per capita GDP and per 
capita energy consumption. Economic growth 
is not accompanied by declining energy 
consumption! Perhaps the most compelling 
description of the energy sector in Afghanistan 
is shown in Figure 5. In 1980, the per capita 
energy consumption of Afghanistan was 
fourth in the region, greater than that of Sri 
Lanka and Bangladesh. By 2004, per capita 
consumption had fallen drastically from 
slightly less than 2 million BTU per person to 
just around 0.5 million BTU. This is at a time 
when all other economies in region exhibited 
strong growth. The significant jump in 
consumption between the late 1980s and early 
1990s was due to the export of natural gas to 
Russia. 
Reliable energy data for Afghanistan is about 
as scarce as energy in Afghanistan. The data 
below are from the US Energy Information 
Administration, the US National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory and other Afghan sources. 
Figure 5. Per capita Energy Consumption 
Electricity (hydro and imports) comprises the 
vast majority of energy consumed or about 
77% of commercial energy. This is followed 
by coal, natural gas and then petroleum. 
Figure 6 below presents the composition of 
commercial energy in 2005. Petroleum 
products account for less than 1% of primary 
energy consumption. Figure 6. Primary Energy Consumption, 2005 
Table 1 presents commercial energy or energy 
that is bought and sold in commercial markets 
such as coal, oil, and gas. It excludes the vast 
amount of biomass energy that is consumed 
and in countries like Afghanistan traditional 
energy represents a major source of energy. 
Afghanistan has gone from an energy 
exporter, natural gas to the Soviet Union, to 
where it imports a substantial amount of 
energy. In 2005, over half of the commercial 
energy consumed came from imports. This is 
due to the deterioration in energy 
infrastructure rather than an increase in 
consumption. As can be seen, consumption 
has remained relatively the same over the last 
several years being constrained by the ability 
to import energy.

Energy in Afghanistan in recent history can be 
categorized as a period where supply has 
always been short of demand, as it has in 
many similar countries. The demand for 
energy outstrips current supply in every 
category of energy, including traditional 
energy which is unsustainably harvested. 
Much of the deficit in supply can be blamed 
on the lack of investment, cannibalization and 
carnage that has accompanied Afghanistan’s 
civil crises since 1978. As civil strife strains 
financial resources new investment is 
abandoned, routine maintenance is postponed; 
spares are taken from one plant for another; 
skilled human resources that are needed to 
maintain the capital stock leave; and soon 
parts are stolen and sold for other uses. Sad 
and unpreventable as this is, a large share of 
the gap can be blamed on faulty resource 
allocation policies. Subsidies, as they are so 
often carried out, create a vicious downward 
cycle. For example, the electric utility often 
does not collect enough to pay for operating 
cost let alone capital costs. This is because (1) 
thirty percent of the energy it supplies is lost, 
(2) some energy that is consumed is not billed, 
(3) some energy that is billed is not collected, 
and (4) the price of energy is below the cost of 
production. When the utility does not collect 
enough, it begins to let maintenance slip and 
as a result, technical losses increase; 
consumers with unreliable service see less 
reason to pay and so collections are even 
lower, leading to downward spiral. As 
mentioned earlier, combined losses and 
subsidies are costing the Government $128.5 
million annually. As can be clearly seen in 
Table 2, this is unsustainable. Given that 
infrastructure investments are growing and 
increasingly more power is being produced, 
unless radical changes take place, losses will 
steadily climb. These losses are not only a 
drain on the power system. They represent 
resources that could be going to produce more 
energy or to other development needs. It is 
clear that changing this must be a top priority 
in the electricity sector.

The energy sector in Afghanistan is 
predominately state owned and operated with 
little private sector participation. Although 
encouraging private investment is a stated 
goal of the IROA, the substantive work that is 
required to create the enabling environment 
for meaningful private sector participation is 
absent. The proper place to begin is with the 
adoption of an overarching energy law and 
redrafting of the sub-sector laws to adequately 
establish the required enabling frameworks. 
The energy sector and its sub-sectors (electric 
power, coal, oil, gas, and renewable energy) 
are undergoing significant expansion. 
However, poor infrastructure, insufficient 
budgetary resources, lack of trained personnel 
and weak government policies (including nonresolution of inter-ministerial cross-cutting 
issues) have complicated and in some 
instances significantly delayed energy 
resource development and deployment. The 
result is that each sub-sector’s entities often 
are not able to effectively maintain, repair, 
manage or expand the system to meet the 
country’s needs. Development of 
Afghanistan’s fossil fuels, in particular natural 
gas and coal, require large capital investment 
and significant private sector participation to 
reach fruition. 
THE STATE OF THE ENERGY 
SUB-SECTORS 
1. Electricity
Electricity drives modern economies and per 
capita consumption of electricity in 
Afghanistan is one of the lowest in the world. 
After a long period of decline, generating 
capacity is beginning to grow again. Hydro 
plants account the largest share of capacity 
with imports in second place and growing. 
The most promising long-term resource for 
power generation in Afghanistan is 
hydropower, which accounts for over 50% of 
grid-connected installed capacity6. Following 
hydropower, thermal generation, primarily 
diesel generation, supplies power mainly to 
urban areas. Utilization of indigenous fossil 
fuels (natural gas and coal) for power 
generation is very limited as is utilization of 
solar, wind and other renewable energy 
resources. Reliance on diesel is both expensive 
and environmentally hazardous. Diesel 
generation costs almost 30 US cents per khw 
compared to natural gas at 3.5 US cents per 
kWh. Efforts are underway to utilize local 
natural gas for power production and this 
should remain a top priority. 
Figure 7. Power Capacity (MW) 2007 
Rural power supply continues to rely mostly 
on micro-hydro plants (MHPs), limited diesel 
(mostly privately owned), and batteries, with 
very limited availability to the rural 
population.7 Most rural power generation 
efforts are funded by donors with limited costsharing by the Government. 
 
6 In the 1980 Master Plan it was estimated that 
Afghanistan has the potential of developing about 23,000 
MW of additional hydro generating capacity, with 
18,000 MW located on the Panj and Amu Rivers that 
form the border with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The 
remaining 5,000 MW potential is primarily in two areas, 
about 1,800 MW on the Kokcha River and 3,200 MW in 
the Kabul River basin. 
7 There is no reliable estimates of rural electricity 
coverage; some anecdotal evidence, including discussions 
with senior executives with DABM, indicates coverage 
from all sources is over 7%, other estimates place it as 
hih 14%Table 3 provides historical data on generation, 
consumption and capacity. 
Table 4. Historical Electricity Data

Connecting each new customer to the system 
is expensive, and can cost up to $1,000 or more 
in distribution costs alone. For Kabul, total 
costs to expand the distribution system are 
estimated at US $310 million. Weak 
distribution systems can lead to significant 
power losses, with estimates for the Kabul 
system at about 30%. As stated earlier, 
technical losses amount to around $28 million 
per year. Since most initial assistance focused 
on rehabilitating and upgrading generation, 
funding for and implementation of 
transmission and distribution system 
improvements must now be a high priority. 
Since it is faster and cheaper to correct 
technical losses than to put in a new large 
scale power plant, this should take equal, if 
not greater, priority with capacity additions.

Source: DABM. The estimated cost of power from natural gas is based on Sheberghan power plant; no estimate 
of cost of coal fired capacity is available at this time. 
Table 4 shows the cost of generating power 
from various sources on the Afghanistan 
power system. The cost of generation differs 
significantly and displacing diesel generation 
with other energy sources through a least-cost 
expansion plan can reduce costs significantly. 
Moreover, it excludes the cost of transmission 
and distribution. When this cost is included, 
extension of the grid may often be more 
expensive than decentralized generation 
including many renewables. 
The financial condition of the sector and the 
utility is going from bad to worse because 
there has been little improvement in tariffs 
and operations while at the same time 
substantial assets have been added to the 
system. Maintaining and operating these is 
expensive and if the Government does not 
shift its focus from building new 
infrastructure alone to efficiently operating 
and maintaining what is has, the burden on 
the economy will be enormous. 
So, what Table 4 clearly shows that if DABM 
wants to expand generation, then there is a 
rank order based on cost? Clearly, hydro and 
imports are preferred to diesel as is natural 
gas. However, what Table 4 does not show is 
the cost of increasing electricity supply and 
this is a more important concept in the case of 
Afghanistan given both the imperatives of cost 
and time. Electricity supply can be increased 
by increasing generation, increasing efficiency 
(reducing technical and commercial losses) 
and by reducing the demand for electricity. In 
fact, because the Government subsidizes 
electricity, it actual saves money for every 
kilowatt hour it can reduce demand while it 
loses on every kWh that it generates. 
One simple example will explain the 
importance of concentrating on reducing 
demand. For every compact fluorescent light 
(CFL) blb dthriing in nrgover the standard incandescent bulb. If a 60W 
bulb is replaced with a 14 watt CFL, there is 
saving of 46 watts. Over the life of the bulb, 
10,000 hours on average, this is saving of 657 
kWh. If the bulb costs US$ 5, then the cost of 
freeing up a kWh is US subsidy amounts to 0.8 
US cents per kWh or one third that of hydro 
and it takes far less time to do this. If the 
subsidy is considered, then the Government 
actual saves money by helping consumers to 
be more efficient. For every US$ 5 the 
Government spends (on a new CFL), it 
reduces the amount it spends on the subsidy 
by US$ 51. This can be seen in Figure 8. 
Figure 8. Cost of Supply 
2. Petroleum
According to geological studies already made, 
considerable resources of gas/petroleum 
existed in Afghanistan and due to the last few 
decades problems, sufficient growth has not 
been made in this respect. Based on MoM 
strategy and policy, growth of resource to be 
undertaken by private sector. 
3. Natural Gas
Natural gas it not yet a significant energy 
resource, although it has the potential to be a 
significant source of energy for the country 
and an important source of revenue to the 
Government. The consumption of natural gas 
is supply constrained just as it is for all other 
energy resources. 
Consumption and production have been 
declining from the highs of the 1990s because 
the infrastructure has been abandoned in 
practical terms and there has been very little 
effort to locate new resources. The data in the 
table below

 4. Production and Reserves
Production of gas is estimated at about 21.2 
million cubic feet/day, although it is likely 
that this is an overestimate8.. 
Like other energy prices, current gas prices are 
too low to cover costs of rehabilitation, O&M 
and expansion of production and 
infrastructure. For incremental gas 
production, tariffs may be less than half of the 
level needed to cover costs. Also, extraction, 
delivery, distribution, sale and collection of 
gas payments to be made by Afghan Gas 
enterprise and the gas cost payment is directly 
transferred to the government account. . . A 
large part of the infrastructure for storage, 
transmission and distribution has been 
damaged while the remaining capacity is in 
need of rehabilitation. According to estimate 
of US geological survey ,the evaluation made 
is indicative of 444 billion cubic meters of 
natural gas reserves, 219 million tons of 
petroleum, and 75 ml tons of condensation. 
E. Crude Oil
According to the studies made, there 
existed some 45 ml tons of geological 
petroleum reserves whilst with respect to 
the above, the recent studies indicate that 
the reserves seem to have been much 
more than the above estimation. 
Ministry of mines plans to lease one 
petroleum area and two gas areas in 2008 
through biddings to private sector for 
exploration, extraction that also includes 
filtration, delivery and sale process. 
5. Petroleum Products
Afghanistan does not have an operating 
refinery and so imports all of its refined 
products. During the Taliban regime a 3,000 
bpd refinery had been constructed but was 
never operational. To increase value added 
output, the IROA is considering construction 
of an oil refinery (approximately 10,000 bpd) 
in North East Afghanistan to refine crude oil 
produced domestically in the region. If 
constructed, this refinery would reduce 
Afghanistan’s dependence on imported oil 
 
8 Engineer Amir Zada, Director of Oil and Gas, 
Miitf MiNb2006 
products and improve the quality of refined 
products consumed in the country. 
Preliminary estimates for this investment 
range from $12-$32 million, depending on 
configuration, infrastructure requirements and 
other factors. 
In Afghanistan, due to lack of oil filtration 
unit, all petroleum products are imported 
from foreign countries. 
All petroleum are imported through the 
neighbouring countries of Pakistan, Iran, 
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan9
. 
Afghanistan consumes approximately 
1,200,000 tons of state-supplied fuel per year10. 
This includes all types of petrol and diesel as 
well as mazut and kerosene. It is estimated 
that about 80% of these fuels are consumed for 
automotive purposes, while 20% are used for 
power auto-production (gasoline mainly) or 
small-scale grid power generation (diesel 
mainly), and water pumps. Demand for 
liquid fuels in Afghanistan has increased 
dramatically in the past five years. With 
continued and increased reliance on diesel 
generation, air traffic and home uses, this 
demand is expected to continue to increase. 
Additionally, fuel quality is quite poor 
compared to international standards and is 
often adulterated. 
While previously the government had a 
monopoly on petroleum products trade, this 
sector is now entirely in private hands. Ten 
traders are registered with the Ministry of 
Transport, as are the 2,658 trucks that are 
authorised to import petroleum products into 
Afghanistan. The Petroleum and Gas 
Enterprise (Liquid Fuels), under the auspices 
of the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, 
provides oversight for 1600 gas stations and 
1300 fuel trucks. Infrastructure as well as 
operational improvements could provide an 
opportunity for private investment and more 
transparent operations. 
There has been no donor support to this 
sector. Instead, more than 30 reported private 
contractors work with the Petroleum and Gas 
Enterprise to supply Afghanistan’s gas

Plan; ADB TA 4088; Sofregaz, June 2004. 
10 This figure excludes privately imported or other fuel 
itt td tthttstations with fuel as well as to import diesel 
fuel for power generation. 
LPG has been increasingly popular as a 
residential fuel in Afghanistan and the 
monthly consumption is estimated to have 
increased to 12 000 tons over Islamic year 
1382. The retail price of LPG in Kabul is of 50-
60 Af / kg, and far less in Herat, which is 
closer to the supplying countries. 
Turkmenistan is the main supplier, followed 
by Iran. The product is carried within 
Afghanistan in 15-20 tons trailer vessels, or in 
cylinders. LPG is stored in three dedicated 
depots: Kotal-e-Khain near Kabul, (80 tons 
capacity), Herat (110 tons capacity), and 
Hairatan near the Uzbekistan border (120 tons 
capacity). The unloading and bottling 
capacities at these plants are unknown, but 
these storage capacities seem small in 
comparison with the estimated overall LPG 
demand. LPG is sold to final consumers in 
cylinders with capacities of 10, 20, and 40 kg. 
6. Coal11
Like all other energy products in Afghanistan, 
the demand for coal is very extensive, 
however the coal production that solves the 
country’s demand seems extremely low.. The 
table below illustrates the production and 
consumption position of coal since 1980. The 
Afghan coal ind ustry is operating at low 
production rates, less than 300,000 tons 
reported per year; devastation of more than 3 
decades of war and years of neglect, has 
affected very seriously the Afghanistan’s coal 
mines. The supply of coal is essential for 
domestic energy / heating and industrial 
uses.Based on studies and laboratory analysis 
that has been fulfilled concerned with the coal 
mines is indicative of the fact that Afghanistan 
has got tremendous coal deposits that exist in 
high level quality . And it needs to be explored 
further. This operation can be completed 
within 3 to 5 consecutive years. The 
preliminary studies indicate that the coal 
deposits are hundred times further than the 
preceding figures and till now approximately 
 
11 This section is taken from the work of Mary 
LiVitlli
some 40 mine deposits have been identified in 
80 areas of Afghanistan. 12. 
Source: US EIA 
Until the end of 2006, Afghan coal operations 
were primarily contained in state enterprises 
of Northern Coal Enterprise and Sabzak Coal 
with oversight of the Ministry of 
Mines.Following the enforcement of mining 
material law, a number of coal mines 
including karkar, Dodkash, sabzak of Herat, 
Chalaw of Kabul province, Parsa of Ghorband 
district have been leased to private sectors 
through biddings. Also it is intended that tens 
of other coal mines according to government 
economic policy to be submitted to private 
sector for exploration and exploitation, 
through which ground will be prepared for 
establishment of private companies having the 
right of mining especially in the sphere of coal 
and cement.. In May 2007, President Karzai 
announced the establishment of a Coal 
Commission aiming at evaluating and 
studying coal for generation of thermal 
electricity . As the commission in its initial 
gathering considered coal throughout the 
country and strongly affirmed its significance 
as an important fuel resource for power 
production and responding other industrial 
demands. Although Afhanistan is seriously in 
need of energy, no programmatic assistance 
has been provided to the Afghan coal sector . 
Coal deposits and cost: according to preceding 
studies, in general terms there are 11 coal 
mines in Afghanistan the total number of 
which fortunately reaches 40 mines at present , 
as majority of that are under exploration and 
exploitation. . Considerable coal reserves have 
yet to be explored in Afghanistan. Coal is used 
in these mining areas as well as transported 
into Kabul and other cities; transport of coal is 
generally conducted by private market entities 
although some mines maintain their own 
transportation as well. The current price of 
coal is indicated to be $65-$90 per ton 
depending on transport costs – the actual coal 
price per ton is estimated to be around $25-34. 
In terms of regional coal costs, this is high. 
 
12 Emergency Mine Rehabilitation assessment, 
Wld Bk2004The health and safety conditions at the mines, 
many of which are underground, are horrific. 
An example is the ongoing fires at the Dahne 
Tor coal mine. US Geological Survey (USGS) 
experts visited the site in 2006 and indicated 
that unregulated mining observed is 
conducted in a seam that is several hundred 
feet (stratigraphically and topographically) 
higher than the main seam that was 
mined decades ago. The main mine was semimechanized, but everything is now collapsed, 
attributed by Afghan coal managers to 
landslides, poor technical oversight and 
general subsidence. It is estimated that 
millions of dollars are required to sufficiently 
upgrade the health and safety conditions at 
these mine operations.Longer-term strategies 
for growth in the Afghanistan coal sector 
remain several years away but consideration 
of coal power is underway; the Ministry of 
Mines has included a 100MW coal fired power 
plant in its 1386 budget figures; this presents 
interesting inter-ministerial issues as the 
Ministry of Energy and Water is responsible 
for state power generation which is implied in 
this budget proposal. The confirmed quantity 
and quality of coal resources remains 
relatively unknown but appears good. Coal 
Uses. Afghan coal is primarily used for home 
cooking and heating needs. The estimated 
demand for coal in Afghanistan is 
approximately 250,000 tones per year (for 
residential, commercial, and light industrial 
uses nationwide). Over the next three years it 
is expected that demand for coal will also 
increase as a result of the manufacture of 
cement and possible coal power development. 
Therefore, recovery of the cement industry 
will significantly alter the total demand for 
coal. Mechanisms are not in place to 
transparently and rapidly address winter coal 
issues. 
Coal for power: In addition to the Aynak 
copper power needs, Government has begun 
to assess the power needs of the proposed 
Hajigak Iron Ore deposit as well as simply the 
generation of coal for power to supply the 
central and western parts of the country that 
now have no or limited power access. This is a 
topic where both the Ministry of Mines and 
the Ministry of Energy and Water have 
important roles but have yet to determine 
strategic priorities for development of coal for 
power including methods to attract 
sustainable investment. Opportunities such as 
this argue for the development a cogeneration 
policy and simplified power purchase 
agreements for co-generated power.

7.   Rural and Renewable
Energy
Renewable energy offers the greatest hope for 
Afghanistan in general and rural energy in 
particular. Renewable energy includes hydro, 
solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and wood. 
Hydro, both large and small, represents 
significant untapped resources. According to 
the ADB, there is 18,400 MW of untapped 
hydro potential in the country13. Afghanistan 
has excellent wind potential in many areas 
 
13 Renewable Energy in Afghanistan, Regional Economic 
CtiCfAli Aii2006
and is economical compared to diesel as 
shown in the table below.

Total 158,100 
Source: National Renewable Energy Laboratory Not all of this potential wind energy can be 
economically converted into electricity 
because of a number of factors such as 
distance from population centers and wind 
speed. However, the first initial survey 
indicates that there is significant potential 
which can be tapped at around US$ 0.09 per 
kWh. 
There is significant solar potential but it still 
remains a high cost energy resource for 
electricity. The Indian Government has 
funded a solar village initiative. While solar 
PV is expensive compared to the cost of 
generation for other alternatives, there is 
strong evidence that with the proper enabling 
environment of micro credit and training, 
solar home systems are a viable electricity 
source14. Solar cookers have shown significant 
promise in other countries and may have 
widespread application here. Solar cookers 
were deployed in Afghan refugee camps in 
Pakistan. 
There are many environmental benefits from 
using renewable energy such as reduced 
emissions (both indoor and outdoor) but the 
development of renewable energy must also 
consider the potentially negative 
environmental impacts. It is important that 
EIA guidelines be followed and the as with 
any energy project, public debate is an 
important tool. 
There is an overwhelming view that rural 
areas need electricity and that providing 
access is the best use of resources for energy. 
An Asia Foundation survey in 2006 concluded 
that hack of reliable electricity at the local level 
was the second most important problem 
behind unemployment. When survey 
respondents were asked that what the largest 
problems at the national level were, they have 
citied electricity as the ninth most important 
problem. The Asia Foundation sample was 
not representative of the country from an 
energy perspective and used a definition for 
rural that obfuscates the real patterns of 
importance in planning development 
 
14 For example, according to Micro Energy 
International solar PV in Bangaldesh cost between US$ 
0.45 to US$ 0.60 per kWh. Despite this high cost 
Grameen Shakti 70,000 solar home systems between 
1996 d 2004
assistance15.
16 The results from other countries 
consistently indicate that there is a hierarchy 
for demand to services and electricity is 
usually further down on the ladder than 
services such as an all weather road, water 
supply, schools, and clinics. For example, if 
the preponderance of survey respondents 
already has access to road, water and schools, 
then electricity may well be their next choice 
of service. In rural-remote Afghanistan, if 
Afghans are similar to the peoples of the 
region, then access to electricity will not be 
their most urgent priority. 
Additionally, experience the world over has 
provided an important lesson with regard to 
blindly providing access to electricity. There 
is no guarantee that increased access to 
electricity will bring economic benefits. 
Simply look around in Kabul and other urban 
areas where residential access has increased. 
If access to electricity is not targeted to or 
coupled with income generating activities, 
then rural access brings lighting and little else. 
8.   DEMAND
Although there is little data for Afghanistan 
on rural energy use, inferences can be drawn 
from similar countries in the region. There is a 
tendency to assume that grid connected 
electricity offers the best form of energy for 
rural populations. Experience throughout the 
world has shown that there is a progression in 
the use of energy. Due to the dispersed nature 
of the rural population, renewable energy 
offers the best solution for electrification for 
the majority of Afghanistan’s rural population 
that currently does not have access to 
 
15 According to their survey, 49% of rural respondents 
had access to electricity and 89% of urban respondents 
had access. Their sample was not representative of the 
country with regard to energy access. In part, what they 
call rural actually represents sizable population centers. 
Moreover, their question did not ask if access to energy 
was an issue but rather the extent to which energy is a 
problem. 
16 The distinction between rural and urban in 
Afghanistan also causes blurring of responsibilities 
between MEW and MRRD and so we use the term 
rural-remote to denote those areas of very low population 
density that are far removed from population and 
commercial centers and lack access to basic services. 
Mill bdld thiltithttelectricity and has no real expectation of 
connection to the grid17. 
It is very important that the economic 
conditions and opportunities of rural 
population be fully understood when devising 
a rural energy strategy. Too often donors and 
Government officials have blindly followed a 
policy of rural electrification. The result has 
been much higher cost energy delivered than 
people can afford and little, if any, associated 
economic activity. The goal of increasing 
energy is poverty reduction and economic 
growth. Electricity alone in rural areas is 
unable to do that job. 
What is not known about rural Afghan’s 
economic and energy characteristics? First, 
rural Afghani’s are poor by most countries’ 
standards. “Over 20.4% of the rural 
population cannot meet the minimum level of 
dietary energy required to sustain a healthy 
life.” 18 Unemployment is rampant. Average 
household income is estimated to be no 
greater than $231 a year.19
 Probably less than 4% of rural households 
have access to electricity20. Of those with 
access, 7% use electricity for lighting. 
Kerosene lamps are the major source of 
lighting, representing roughly 86 percent. It is 
highly likely given what is known about other 
countries, that the main source of cooking fuel 
is from self collected fire wood from which 
there is no monetary outlay or charcoal. This 
information is valuable because it tells us how 
much of a rural household’s money income is 
devoted to energy. Using detailed data for 
Balochistan, the average rural household 
spends only 3.5% of its budget on energy and 
this includes imputed or noncash outlays. 
Clearly, for many families on the lower end of 
the income spectrum, the vast majority of 
energy services are self supplied – that is

Water: Policy for Renewable Energy Rural 
Electrification, December 8, 2006.

Chapter 3. 
19 This was based on the ratio of rural household income 
to urban household income in Pakistan. Clearly, the 
rural population of Pakistan is on average better off than 
that of Afghanistan.

l
through the gathering of fuel wood, crop 
residues, and other biomass. Energy 
expenditures were dominated by wood, 
charcoal, and kerosene. Wood and charcoal 
are used mainly for cooking and heating, 
while kerosene is the main source of lighting. 
Rural Afghanistan is similar. 
Extreme poverty in rural areas also is related 
to lack of income earning opportunities. The 
productive use of energy helps reduce poverty 
by providing alternative sources of livelihoods 
and increase educational and training 
opportunities. The remoteness of rural 
locations and the rough terrain make 
expansion of the electricity grid into these 
areas economically infeasible. Therefore, the 
application off-grid technologies to these 
areas—including renewable energy 
resources— and other forms of energy is the 
primary focus of IROA activities. 
9. SUPPLY  
There is no reliable data on traditional energy 
use in rural Afghanistan. The bulk of 
commercial energy is supplied by kerosene, 
Hydro power and diesels. Hydro, wind and 
solar offer opportunities for small scale 
supply. Following hydro, solar energy has the 
greatest potential as a renewable energy 
source, but cost remains a major barrier. 
Estimates indicate that in Afghanistan solar 
radiation averages about 6.5 kWh per square 
meter per day and the skies are sunny about 
300 days a year. Consequently, the potential 
for solar energy development is high, not only 
for solar water heaters for homes, hospitals 
and other buildings, but also for generating 
electricity. In addition, some 125 sites have 
been identified for micro-hydro resource 
development with the potential to generate 
100 MW of power. 
Other renewable energy technologies, 
particularly micro-hydro and wind energy, 
have broad applicability within rural areas of 
Afghanistan and offer employment 
opportunities directly through operation and 
maintenance requirements, and indirectly 
through businesses like agro-processing that 
provide off-farm work. 
The IROA, primarily through the Ministry of 
Rural Rehabilitation and Development in 
cooperation with the MEW has developed projects to promote microhydro development 
in rural areas. In addition, under the US 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory, wind 
mapping has been undertaken for many parts 
of Afghanistan as a basis for developing 
individual projects. The data indicate good 
potential for generating wind electricity in 
several parts of the country. The lead institute 
to support development of these resources in 
Afghanistan is the National Renewable Energy 
Research and Development Center, a part of 
MEW. 
Hydropower, solar, wind and biomass offer 
the most potential to contribute to energy 
supply. Development, however, requires 
sound institutional and financial support, 
sustained commitment and a long-term 
development horizon. Use of renewable 
energy is beset by a number of factors, 
including high upfront costs,21 lack of 
suppliers, inadequate financing mechanisms, 
and weak institutional and technical capacity. 
10. Afghanistan as an Energy
Transit Route
Due to its location between the oil and natural 
gas reserves of the Caspian Basin and the 
Indian Ocean, Afghanistan has long been 
mentioned as a potential energy route. This 
might include power transmission via high 
tension lines, or perhaps eventually a gas 
pipeline. 
Afghanistan is well positioned to be a transit 
route for electricity produced in CAR 
countries and exported to South Asia, and 
perhaps eventually it might also become a net 
exporter of power produced from its own 
hydro, natural gas, and coal resources. Efforts 
are currently underway to increase electricity 
imports from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan and Iran and to upgrade crossborder transmission links. Development of a 
regional power network with Afghanistan as a 
transit route between CAR and South Asia is 
an important potential medium-term 
objective. 
 
21 For example, estimate for Photovoltaic electricity, as 
per MRRD (Mostafa Torkan, May 24, 2007) is 
$12,000/kW, as compared to: (i) Micro-hydropower at 
$1200/kW d Dil td t $500/kW
At the present time, with support from the 
ADB and the World Bank, the four countries 
of Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and 
Pakistan are actively exploring construction of 
a high tension line that would transmit 1300 
MW of power from Central Asia through 
Afghanistan to Pakistan, with Pakistan 
receiving 1,000 MW, and Afghanistan gaining 
300 MW. Construction of such a project 
would directly address Afghanistan’s need for 
power, and might also help to lay the 
groundwork for an eventual natural gas 
pipeline. 
During the mid-1990s, Unocal had pursued a 
possible natural gas pipeline from 
Turkmenistan's Dauletabad-Donmez gas basin 
via Afghanistan to Pakistan, but withdrew 
after 1998. The Afghan government has 
recently tried to revive the Trans-Afghan 
Pipeline (TAP) plan, and has held talks on 
these matters with Pakistan, and 
Turkmenistan. Little progress appears to have 
been made. The President has stated his belief 
that the project could generate $100-$300 
million per year in transit fees for Afghanistan, 
while creating thousands of jobs in the 
country. Given the obstacles to development 
of a natural gas pipeline across Afghanistan, it 
seems unlikely that such an idea will make 
any progress until the security position is 
resolved. The estimated cost of the pipeline is 
$2.5-$3.5 billion which represents a further 
obstacle to its implementation. 
CASA-1000 and Proposed Power Levels. 
CASA-1000 is a proposed transmission system 
to transmit 1,000 Megawatts of surplus 
electricity from Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz 
Republic to Pakistan, with power transiting 
through and energy deliveries happening 
within Afghanistan. If it goes forward, it 
would start operations circa 2011. Kabul 
would have a substation, which initially 
would receive approximately 100 MW going 
up to about 300 MW by 2016. Over the life of 
the project about 90% of the power would be 
used by Pakistan while, 10% would be taken 
by Afghanistan. 
With 562 km of HTDC transmission, 
Afghanistan has the largest share of CASA 
1000 transmission lines, representing about 
52.1% of the total project costs. Total 
estimated project costs are $545.6 mil of which 
Afghanistan’s allocation is $2845 milAfghanistan would receive common equity of 
$59.8 mil and begin receiving dividends 
following a grace period. Current analysis 
indicates a return of 16% on equity by year 
2033. In addition, Afghanistan would begin 
receiving a 52.1% share of Transit Fees once 
CASA-1000 becomes operational. 
11. Energy for the New City at
Dehsabz
Guiding the energy strategy for Dehsabz is the 
Trias Energetica concept comprising three 
pillars: Reduce energy demand to the lowest 
rate possible; supply the energy that is 
required from sustainable resources; and, 
where fossil energy is required, use it as 
efficiently as possible. Although Afghanistan 
has one of the lowest per capita energy 
consumption rates in the world, that rate is 
expected to increase to a level comparable to 
that of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan over the 
next 30 years. Energy demand will increase as 
the city grows, so the energy supply must 
keep pace with the anticipated demand if 
project momentum is to be achieved and 
maintained. Consequently energy generation 
and distribution infrastructure will be a 
priority in each construction phase. 
Reducing energy demand is a design 
consideration incorporated in every building 
and system in DehSabz. From the use of 
concrete core activation methods to heat and 
cool floors walls and ceilings via geothermal 
sources, to the correct solar orientation of each 
building, the demand for energy is minimized. 
Energy that is required is generated as much 
as possible through sustainable means 
including hydro-electricity, micro hydroelectricity, passive and active solar generation, 
biomass and refuse combustion, deep 
geothermal power. But, as exciting as the 
possibilities of zero ecological footprints 
through sustainable energy production are, 
there will be gaps in the energy production 
cycle that will have to be filled by diesel 
generators. But even here sustainable 
technologies can be applied. Afghanistan is 
searching for replacement crops for Opium 
Poppies so as to ensure sustainable livelihoods 
in rural districts. The production of biodiesel 
for the generators will require a yield of 
approximately 42,000 dry Tonnes of oil seed 
per year. Combined with the biodiesel 
requirements of other cities and local rural 
requirements it is conceivable that the 
production of biomass for fuel could gradually 
replace poppy cultivation in large parts of the 
nation. 
The energy strategy includes the concept of a 
robust network, able to withstand the rigors of 
the climate and the terrain. Traditional power 
networks operate on the concept of centralized 
production and wide area distribution, 
making them vulnerable to environmental 
effects, system defects and, if the generation 
capacity is outside the nation, market effects. 
The Dehsabz energy strategy is founded on 
the principle of widely distributed and diverse 
generation, coupled to network enabled but 
localized distribution. In effect energy is 
consumed as close to the point of production 
as possible, reducing losses in the transmission 
system while reducing the expense and 
engineering required in a high tension 
distribution system. The power grid is 
networked however so that power can be 
distributed among the districts at peak times 
and to mitigate system failures or 
environmental effects. 
Such a fully integrated and sustainable energy 
network has never been built before, thus 
Dehsabz has the potential to become a world 
leader in the field, showcasing leading edge 
technologies. The national prestige accruing 
from such a project will generate national 
pride and help to restore Afghanistan to its 
rightful place as a valued regional trading 
partner and economic ally. 
INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS 
Responsibility for energy is complicated; at 
present, four ministries have portfolios that 
include direct engagement with the energy 
sector and its development in Afghanistan: 
 Ministry of Energy and Water (electricity 
generation (hydro, imports), 
transmission, distribution) 
 Ministry of Mines (oil, gas, coal) 
 Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and 
Development (rural electrification) 
 Ministry of Commerce and Industries 
(liquid fuels) The Ministries maintain Kabul headquarters 
and regional offices (i.e., MoM has seven 
regional offices) in addition to state owned 
enterprise offices throughout the country (i.e., 
the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) 
oversees DABM that maintains 19 regional 
“breshnas” or operations). 
A fifth ministry, the Ministry of Urban 
Development, is engaged with energy in two 
forms: (1) street lighting primarily in Kabul 
and (2) heating22 of the five Kabul-based 
“Macrorayon Apartment blocks” constructed 
during the Soviet era. Until late 2006 there was 
weak coordination of energy related 
development among these ministries. 
Coordination has continued to be weak 
through 2007. Coordination may improve 
somewhat in the years 2008 – 2010. 
In addition, the Ministry of Finance plays an 
integral role in determining and agreeing to 
development and national budget funds for 
energy-related projects. The Ministry of 
Economy was identified in August 2006 to lead 
and coordinate the above ministries as 
members of the Inter-Ministerial Commission for 
Energy (ICE) discussed below. Finally, the 
Cabinet of Ministers and High Economic Council 
of Ministers (comprised of key economic ministers)
have undefined but definite roles in reviewing 
energy project selection, funding levels and 
approval at various times to various degrees. 
Parliament’s Economic Committee has included 
energy in its portfolio and conducted 
occasional meetings with energy ministers and 
their staff. 
There are eleven state owned enterprises 
operating in the energy sector. They include 
companies such as DABM and Afghan Gas. 
The Inter-Ministerial Commission for 
Energy (ICE) was established by a Presidential 
Decree signed in December 2006 as the 
coordinating and policy making body for 
energy sector activities. Chaired by the 
Minister of the Economy, it includes the 
Ministries of Energy and Water, Finance, and 
Mines as core members and the Ministries of 
Commerce and Industry, Foreign Affairs, 
Urban Development and Rural Rehabilitation 
and Development as ad hoc members. 
 
22 District heating was installed as part of the 
iitil tti
The establishment of ICE was designed to 
help the Government understand, support, 
design, and monitor energy development 
based on commercial principles. It has 
oversight of energy sector policy and 
infrastructure investments and coordinates 
support from development partners. ICE 
brings together a wide array of 
government and donor interests to assure 
coordinated action and practical planning. 
It is not be responsible for project 
implementation but develops sound policy 
in line with fiscal and policy priorities and 
international standards. ICE is supported 
by an ADB grant, which includes 
formation of a commercial advisory team 
within the Commission that assists the 
Government in identifying energy 
investments and shaping ongoing projects. 
It also assists the Government in 
agreements to stimulate private sector 
investment. The Ministry of Finance is the 
executing agency for the project. 
In addition to the above established 
institutions, the following advisor positions 
and national programs play a role in energy 
sector development in Afghanistan: 
 Advisor on Mines and Energy to the 
Office of the President. 
 Afghanistan Investment Support Agency 
(AISA). 
 Afghanistan National Development 
Strategy (ANDS). 
 Afghan National Standardization 
Authority (ANSA). 
 MRRD’s National Solidarity Program 
(NSP) 
 Priority Reform and Reconstruction 
Program (PRR) 
The complexity of this institutional framework 
contributes to the difficulties in developing an 
effective strategy for the sector and in 
implementing and monitoring sector 
rehabilitation and reform measures. Attention 
to sector governance aimed at streamlining 
and combining functions within the ministries 
with the ultimate goal of reducing the IROA’s 
direct involvement in the energy sector in 
favor of increased private sector participation 
need to be an important part of the IROA’s 
overall Energy Sector StrategyLEGAL, POLICY AND 
REGULATORY 
FRAMEWORKS 
MoM laws and regulations in accordance with 
the country’s constitution form an appropriate 
basis for attraction of investments. 
There are three energy laws: 
 Power Consumption Law of 1982; 
addresses power imports, generation, 
transmission and distribution; 
 Hydrocarbons law has already been 
dispatched to the parliament for 
approval. 
 Coal: Minerals Law of 2005; regulations 
to be drafted in 2007-08. 
Additionally, the Environment Law has been 
in force since January 2007 and this provides a 
framework for reviewing projects and their 
impact on the environment. 
DONOR PROGRAMS AND 
PROJECTS23
While there are many donors involved in all 
aspects of energy production, the largest are 
the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, 
Germany, India and the US. The Table below 
is a summary of the donor participation in the 
electric power sector according to Afghanistan 
Energy Information Center (AEIC) as of mid2006. Additionally the ADB is involved in the 
gas field rehabilitation at Sheberghan and WB 
is supporting coal mine feasibility study. The 
WB has also sponsored studies of distribution 
systems for major load centers in the north 
and has planned similar work in the southern 
cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah once the 
security situation there has stabilized. Also as 
indicated in the Table, the donors are active in 
both actual infrastructure projects as well as in 
institutional and capacity building efforts. 
More recently there have been projects to 
upgrade the distribution systems at Lashkar 
Gah, Qalat, and Aybak underbillion, 
depending on the country’s absorptive 
capacity.

The WB is intensively involved in the power 
sector. It has a five-year plan totaling $1.2 
billion, depending on the country’s absorptive 
capacity. The WBs plan has the following 
goals for 2008: 
 Rehabilitate 94MW of hydropower 
capacity; 
 Establish 25,000 new connections in 
Kabul; 
 Integrate the Energy Programme with the 
plans for the new city at Dehsabz 
 Rehabilitated medium voltage network in 
Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif; 
 TA in energy sector, including the 
corporatization of DABM; 
 Trade facilitation to encourage energy 
transfer from Central Asia; and 
 Continued involvement in NEPS. 
The ADB has also been very active in the 
energy sector: As a total amount of 12 USD has 
been allocated in grant for testing and 
preparing gas wells aimed at settling the 
requirements of the gas factory of 100 
megawatt turbine based in Sherberghan. Also, 
Afghanistan 
Development Bank(ADB) has allocated 
another 24 ml USD for rehabilitation of gas 
infrastructures that is 12 for rehabilitation of 
gas wells and the remaining 12 ml will be for 
exchange of gas delivery network from the gas 
based area of Khawja Gogerdak till power and 
fertilizer factories with a length of 100kms.

 A Project Preparatory Technical 
Assistance (PPTA) for small and medium 
hydropower development; 
 A capacity-building TA at the MEW;

Program. 
A. Rural Energy Donor
Operations
At present, about 650 villages are supplied 
with electricity from photovoltaic (PV), 
through a program funded by the National 
Solidarity Program (NSP) and under the 
auspices of MRRD. The NSP is a nationwide 
community-driven development program run 
by the Ministry of Rural Reconstruction and 
Development (MRRD) and funded by various 
bilateral and multilateral donors, primarily 
through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust 
Fund (ARTF). NSP is supported by nongovernment (NGO) partners that facilitate the 
election of Community Development Councils 
(CDCs) and help the councils to identify 
community development projects. NGOs are 
contracted as facilitating partners to assist 
communities in the technical and financial 
implementation of projects that for energy 
have include micro-hydro and diesel power 
installations. NSP’s partners have identified 
over 3000 rural energy projects. NSP has 
funded around 1700 diesel generators and 500 
micro hydro plants. 
Other donors (e.g., Government of India) and 
NGOs (e.g., Norwegian Church Aide) are 
active in this area. The private sector also is 
encouraged to participate and invest in rural 
electrification and deployment of energy 
efficiency and renewable energy technologies. 
Although, NGOs and donors provide much 
assistance, there appears to be no clear IROA 
policy for rural electrification or for promoting 
private sector participation in rural energy 
projects; also coordination among ministries 
and other project participants' needs 
improvement. 
THE ROLE OF THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR 
Throughout the world, the role of the private 
sector in energy is growing and is significant 
in most countries. In Afghanistan, it is 
virtually nonexistent. The roles of the private 
sector vary from managing government 
owned assets to outright ownership and 
operation. There are examples where all these 
mechanisms coexist in one country. There are 
other examples where countries have chosen 
one model and others where the country 
transitions over time from the simplest model 
(management contract) to complete ownership 
and operation. 
To be sure, there are obstacles in 
Afghanistan to greater private sector 
involvement, primarily to investment, but 
some of these obstacles can be overcome 
or offset with innovative mechanisms. 
The private sector can be called upon to 
manage, operate, invest and/or own 
energy entities and operations. Each 
different mechanism has its advantages 
and disadvantages. Often, there is a 
progression from management through 
ownership that takes into account the 
current situation. In the electricity subsector for example, it is highly unlikely 
under the current security, institutional, policy 
and legal/regulatory situation that private 
investors will be attracted to invest in a largescale power plant. However, until these 
issues are resolved, there are many other 
ways to use the private sector. Billing can 
be outsourced. The construction arms of 
DABM could be sold off, allowing DABM 
to focus on core operations. Following 
DABM’s commercialization, distribution 
could be given on a management contract. 
Individual power plants could be given 
on management contract. There are a 
variety of mechanisms available now for 
the IROA to tap the private sector as it 
prepares the enabling frameworks and 
other requisite mechanisms to foster full 
private sector ownership and operation. 
One of the questions that have been posed 
in this strategy exercise is whether or not 
DABM (and other SOEs) should be 
unbundled. In this context, unbundling 
has meant the separation of the utility into 
different operating units and the 
privatization by sale of one or more of 
those units or ownership unbundling. 
For example, the distribution part of 
DABM might be separated into several 
smaller distribution companies and then 
sold as could be generationThe empirical evidence is mixed and does not 
strongly support one position or the other. 
In fact, many of the earlier proponents of 
unbundling have now taken a more 
conservative position that the virtues of 
unbundling depend upon numerous 
factors such as the size of the market, the 
availability of substitutes, the cost 
production and the overall structure and 
position of the sector within the economy. 
Simply put, when a country or market are 
small, unbundling may not achieve the 
results it will in larger, more mature 
markets. Afghanistan’s market is quite 
small and immature. Ownership 
unbundling is the last stage of a four step 
process. At this time it is not possible 
because the other steps have not yet 
begun. 
To be sure, the commercialization of 
DABM and other SOEs will require some 
unbundling. The first step is accounting 
unbundling or the separation of accounts 
of different functions. Functional 
unbundling will follow. This is the 
separation of functions within the 
company and the imposition of 
restrictions on activities such as physical 
separation of people, of management, 
separation of information that competitors 
may need separation of services that 
should be regulated from those that are 
competitive in nature, etc. Functional 
unbundling can either take place within 
the same company or be unbundled into 
an affiliate company. Functional 
unbundling also means accounting 
unbundling. Then there is legal 
unbundling but this “does not imply a 
change of ownership of assets and nothing 
prevents similar or identical employment 
conditions applying throughout the whole 
of the vertically integrated undertakings. 
However, a non-discriminatory decisionmaking process should be ensured 
through organizational measures 
regarding the independence of the 
decision-makers responsible.” Legal 
unbundling will of necessity include 
accounting and functional unbundling
The strategy envisions that with time DABM 
and other energy sector SOEs will go step by 
step to legal unbundling. Some non-core 
functions will either be outsourced or 
completely divested, reaching the last step of 
ownership unbundling. The outcome of this 
strategy exercise is that there are more 
fundamental reforms required in the laws, 
rules and regulations and at DABM before 
large scale ownership unbundling should be 
considered. 
CHALLENGES, RISKS AND 
CONSTRAINTS 
A number of challenges, constraints and risks, 
both real and perceived, associated with the 
ability of the IROA to develop and implement 
a comprehensive Energy Sector Strategy need 
to be addressed. These include the following. 
A. Private Sector Provision
The single most important challenge facing 
energy is attracting the private sector in a 
meaningful way. The sector is plagued by 
inefficiency and under investment. While 
second best measures can be put in place, such 
as the commercialization of DABM, the 
optimal solution is eventual private sector 
provision throughout the sector. Private sector 
participation in Afghanistan’s energy sector is 
crucial to achieving the long term objectives of 
the sector. Efforts to attract private investment 
are incorporated within IROA programs and 
projects, but there is no coordinated approach 
to achieving this goal. In particular, options 
for private participation beyond equipment 
and supplies and management contracts need 
to be explored, and effective policies put into 
place. The IROA and donors, through the 
“one-stop shop” at the MEW, the Afghanistan 
Investment Support Agency, or other 
mechanisms need to address this issue and 
increase opportunities for local and 
international investors in the energy sector 
The constraints facing greater private sector 
involvement include legal protection for 
private sector investors, lack of a regulatory 
environment, credit worthiness of a potential 
buyer, and general security. 
C. CapacityPerhaps the single biggest constraint in the 
sector is the very limited capacity given the 
tasks that need to be accomplished. Both the 
Ministries and the SOEs are characterized by 
limited capacity and few trained/skilled 
personnel below the senior levels. It is 
imperative that basic managerial skills be 
developed and that training in accounting and 
finance also take place. Additionally, while a 
sector PMU is recommended, it is also 
important that project management, and 
monitoring and evaluation skills be upgraded 
at the Ministries and SOEs. 
A lot of resources have gone into capacity 
building and the concern is how to make 
delivery more effective. First, general 
management, finance and accounting training 
are needed and this can take place as part of 
larger training programs not specifically 
focused on the energy sector, second, training 
efforts at the Ministries and SOE’s need to be 
elevated. Third, for technical training, it is 
recommended to use developing country 
training venues, for example, in India there are 
the National Thermal Power Corporation and 
IREDA; ICIMOD in Nepal; TNB in Malaysia 
and the Egyptian Electricity Holding 
Company in Cairo. In petroleum, there are 
excellent training venues in the Gulf countries. 
Donors have helped to establish impressive 
institutionalized training programs in 
countries throughout the region and relying 
on these reduces cost and increases 
effectiveness. 
B. Information and Planning
As mentioned in several places in this report, 
the lack of information severely hampers both 
analysis of current and historical information 
and planning. While the IROA and Donor 
strategy has out of necessity focused on 
immediate needs, the long run health of the 
sector and the economy depend critically on 
the collection, dissemination and evaluation of 
energy information and its use in planning. 
C. Efficiency
The second most important challenge facing 
the energy sector is the efficient operation of 
SOEs and heavy reliance on subsidies to 
support these SOEs. Focus has been on 
expanding supply and major rehabilitation of 
generation and NEPS. The two principal 
constraints here are (1) the lack of complete 
and effective commercialization of SOEs such 
as DABM and (2) lack of priority given to 
funding these efforts. This is also the result of 
insufficient capacity. 
D. Fuel
The cost of fuel to support electricity 
generation, especially for Kabul and until 
NEPS is completed, will be about $100 
million/year and another $25 
million/year for SEPS. Funding and 
procurement mechanisms to obtain this 
fuel are not yet established and need to be 
addressed. 
E. Imports
Prices and availability of power from other 
CAR countries also are uncertain. Imported 
power costs will probably be as much, if not 
more, than 4 cents/kWh or more in 2010 
requiring an annual hard currency 
requirement of $160 million and potentially 
placing a significant burden on the IROA. 
However, this is still much cheaper than diesel 
generation. 
F. Cost Recovery
The average cost of power to residential 
customers currently is about 3.8 Afs/kWh. 
However to cover costs of supply, it would 
need to increase to 7 Afs/kWh or more24. The 
IROA‘s goal is to raise tariffs to cover 75% of 
DABM’s costs, thus rising to at least 5.3 
Afs/kWh or 28% by 2010. This will place a 
significant burden on households and 
represents a political risk for the Government, 
especially if service quality isn’t improved 
significantly commensurate with tariff 
increases. To help offset this revenue shortage, 
efforts at DABM to improve billing and 
revenue collection and reduce losses 
(currently estimated at a minimum of 40%) 
need to be a primary focus. 
G. Rural Energy
Addressing rural energy needs and expanding 
access to commercial supplies of energy is a 
 
24 MEW puts the cost of power generation at 
US $0123 kWhdaunting task, requiring a longterm 
commitment of resources, both financial and 
institutional and a coordinated approach to 
addressing this issue through regional and 
local organizations. Moreover, an evaluation 
and prioritization of rural energy resource and 
delivery options is needed to ensure the 
effectiveness of programs and projects, and a 
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation 
process is needed. The GOA, with the support 
of donors needs to review, evaluate and revise 
its rural energy programs to effectively 
address these needs. 
The biggest challenge in addressing effective 
rural energy needs will be to find innovative 
ways to couple energy service delivery with 
economic activities. Constraints are the low 
levels of income and lack of access to micro 
credit and the political inertia of providing 
rural, grid based electricity. Added to this is 
the need to rationalize rural electrification 
between MEW and MRRD so that each can 
best address the problems with their specific 
resources. 
Additionally, as households transition from 
biomass to other fuels for cooking, heating and 
lighting, efforts need to be made to consider 
the differential impacts and uses between 
women, children and men. These differences 
are significant and adoption and use of 
different energy sources depends on 
addressing the needs of these different groups. 
 CHAPTER II 
ENERGY SECTOR STRATEGY
ENERGY STRATEGIC VISION 
“An Energy sector that provides citizens of 
Afghanistan and drivers of growth in the 
economy with long-term reliable, affordable 
energy access based on market-based private 
sector investment and public sector 
oversight.” 
Overall Energy Sector Goals 
 Restructured sector governance and costrecoverable operations 
 Rehabilitation and expansion of the 
public power grid 
 The attraction of private investment in 
the energy sector 
 Improved rural energy access 
 Development of indigenous resources for 
power and energy use 
There is a time in Afghanistan’s future when 
energy will be abundant, blackouts will be a 
thing of the past, and most of its energy needs 
will be provided directly by the private sector. 
Private investors will develop power plants, 
operate and own distribution systems and 
develop in situ resources, just as they have 
begun to do in many countries. But that is the 
distant future. For now, Afghanistan must 
work hard to increase energy production, 
doing so efficiently and in a cost effective 
manner. It can do this by building new 
capacity and by improving the efficiency of 
existing infrastructure, building capacity in its 
workforce, and reorganizing its energy 
operations to make them more transparent, 
increase operating efficiency and prepare 
them for eventual entry into the private sector. 
At the same time though, it must begin laying 
the ground-work for the eventual large-scale 
participation of the private sector. 
Above all, this means that development of the 
electricity sector and the fuels that feed it are 
the single most important priority in the 
energy sector! 
India, a country with far greater security, more 
resources, a larger and better trained technical 
cadre and a much better established 
framework for energy and commercial 
ventures, began serious embarking on IPPs in 
1992. The first IPP, a gas combined cycle by a 
local company, was commissioned in late 
1996. Many foreign IPP developers such as 
Enron, Congentrix and AES all started the IPP 
process but only a handful finished. The 
bottom line is that today, 15 years after the IPP 
program started, most generation is still 
Government owned and most IPPs are Indian 
owned and financed. Afghanistan can learn 
from India’s mistake and their success but 
can’t expect to have large IPP projects in less 
time than they did. This is not to say that we 
can’t and won’t have private sector 
involvement; we must and we will. And the 
time to begin preparing for the private sector 
is now. 
Afghanistan must not only focus on the 
immediate energy needs but turn attention to 
the longer run. It knows where it is going and 
but not necessarily how to get there. This 
strategy will address the questions of where 
we are going and how we get there. What this 
means for energy is that as we continue to 
focus our efforts on short run options to 
increase supply25, one must begin developing 
the foundation that will support long run 
sustainable growth. It means stemming the 
losses at SOEs like DABM, reorganizing them 
and commercializing them. It means investing 
in repair and maintenance and in loss 
 
25 Increasing supply can come about through 
building new capacity, increasing imports or 
dithil lreduction. It means making difficult choices 
among various projects of the different 
Government entities for the next two to five 
years. It means in some cases organizing other 
Ministries’ projects around electricity supply 
because this is what will drive the economy. It 
is imperative that in the near future more 
electricity be provided to more people in the 
most expeditious manner possible while being 
mindful of the long run economic impact. At 
the same time, Afghanistan must be laying the 
legal, regulatory, commercial and institutional 
foundations to unleash the power of the 
private sector when conditions are 
appropriate. 
Afghanistan does not have an integrated 
energy strategy. Rather, it has a coal strategy, 
an electric power strategy, and a hydrocarbons 
strategy. In part, this reflects the 
government’s treatment of energy as separate 
institutional and sector silos and, in part, it 
reflects the lack of institutional depth to see 
that energy markets and, perhaps, more 
importantly, that electricity supply projects are 
highly intertwined with other sub-sectors. In 
part it reflects the nature of assistance 
activities that focused on keeping the lights on 
and the vehicles rolling. 
Integrated energy planning and policy 
development are key to a well functioning 
energy sector. But the IROA is not yet 
equipped to develop an integrated strategy, 
plans or policy analysis because the basic 
energy sector data is missing or rudimentary; 
energy-economic models do not exist; 
mechanisms for sharing information and 
collaborating are not in place. In short, work 
must begin on all of these so that better sub 
sector and integrated energy planning and 
policy analysis/formulation can take place. 
For example, fundamental gaps in data on 
energy supply and consumption and the 
developable resource base coupled with 
uncertainties in forecasts of key 
developmental indicators (economic growth, 
income, level and structure of energy demand, 
rates of population growth and urbanization) 
have made development of an effective sector 
strategy, including determining the 
effectiveness of short-term assistance 
activities, all the more difficult. 
To date, the primary focus has been shortterm
the rehabilitation of generation and 
expansion of energy services using high cost 
resources such as diesel. Long-term 
sustainability requires promoting 
development of energy resources on a leastcost26 basis in an environmentally sound and 
socially acceptable way. Now is the time to 
begin developing the tools that will help 
Afghanistan take a broader more long-term 
approach, to review options, and to look at 
developing least-cost energy resources for 
meeting Afghanistan Compact goals and 
objectives. This strategy incorporates projects 
that are already in the pipeline but also 
considers what policies, programs, and 
projects could be re-evaluated and given a 
new priority (e.g., sector governance) to 
ensure that they provide results at lowest cost 
and maximize impacts for a given level of 
assistance. 
The broad goals for the energy sector are: 
 Increased Private Sector Provision of 
Energy 
 Better Sector Governance 
 Increased trade with neighboring 
countries, focusing on the 
transmission of energy; 
 Expand the availability of electric 
power; 
 Develop a Master Plan for Rural 
Energy; and, 
 Establish market-based tariffs with a 
clear timetable to phase out subsidies. 
The best strategy at this time is a four 
paralleled prong approach. The first prong is 
to improve the efficiency of existing 
operations. This will be accomplished by 
physical investments such as the repair and 
renovation of existing energy infrastructure 
 
26 A correct least cost program would define 
cost in the economic definition of cost and not 
the financial definition. Thus, it would include 
the environmental benefits or costs and price 
externalities. In this manner, the least-cost 
method would produce an economically 
optimal solution. However, this is rarely ever 
done and cost takes on a purely private 
definition with the result that too much fossil 
fuel energy is consumed and produced 
relative to other forms of energy and, in 
general, too much energy is used in the and the procurement of spares. It will involve 
changes in the operations of energy sector 
SOEs. The most important of these is DABM. 
Commercialization of DABM must be fast 
tracked. It must operate on a commercial basis 
with clear targets for loss reduction and 
officers and employees need to be rewarded 
for increasing efficiency and cutting losses and 
held accountable for performance. Aside from 
the financial implication of continued losses, 
there are other sound reasons for focusing on 
this area. Adding a megawatt of power 
through repair and renovation is usually 
quicker and certainly cheaper than building 
new capacity. Progress is being made on 
building new capacity but repair and 
renovation is slower than it should be. For 
example, it is only now, in September 2007, 
that DABM has begun a limited campaign to 
identify losses. Training is urgently required 
in all areas from general accounting to 
advanced power system controls. he second 
prong must be to significantly improve sector 
governance and begin involving the private 
sector in various aspects of energy until the 
legal, commercial and security climate is 
conducive to transfer most aspects of the 
energy sector to the private sector27. The 
single most important governance measure 
will be the establishment of a multi-sector 
regulator under the Ministry of Economy. 
Arguments are frequently made that the 
private sector won’t participate or that it 
should not participate until and unless 
significant reform and improvements have 
been made. The reality is different. 
Afghanistan can begin now by introducing 
management contracts for some aspects, 
outsourcing others and in the case of 
peripheral operations such as construction, 
they can be spun off. Small as these measures 
may be, they will invigorate the sector by 
tapping private sector resources and 
management. They will allow Government 
entities to focus on core activities and build a 
successful track record in private sector 
involvement. At the same time though, every 
effort must be made to lay the foundation of 
 
27 Clearly there is overlap between prongs 1 and 2. 
Increased efficiency will in some part necessitate 
improved Governance and the ultimate efficiency gains 
will be possible only with private provision. These 
commonalities notwithstanding, these two areas are 
different in their major focus. 
enabling laws, policies and regulations that 
unleash the full potential of private sector 
investment and operation of large scale energy 
facilities. 
THE THIRD PRONG IS RURAL 
ENERGY INSTEAD OF RURAL 
ELECTRIFICATION. 
A. Rural Energy in the Vision
mpirical evidence from the developing 
world clearly indicates that household's 
transition to different forms of energy 
based on complex economic, cultural, 
technical and social relationships. People 
do not just go from cooking on firewood 
to cooking on electricity. Additionally, if 
they used a certain amount of lumens or 
btus in, for example, lighting, they do not 
use the same amount when moving up 
from candles to kerosene or from kerosene 
to electricity. 
The findings discussed earlier lead to several 
major conclusions that have profound 
implications for rural energy. 
 First, given these income levels, some 
electricity services will need to be 
subsidized. As shown above, if rural 
households were putting all their energy 
expenditures into electricity, this would 
mean consumption of 13.5 kWh per 
month or enough to run two 60 W electric 
light bulbs for about 4 hours per day. 
 Second, residential energy use will be 
very limited and there is a definite 
transitioning in energy use that takes 
place. The order of use will most likely 
be lighting, radio, fan, TV, and then an 
iron or some other small appliance. It 
will be a long time before electricity takes 
on uses for cooking and heating in rural 
areas. This means that, until incomes rise 
significantly, only a small portion of 
energy expenditures will be directed to 
electricity. Rural residential consumers 
will consume very small amounts of 
electricity for the foreseeable future. 
Income generating activities WILL 
require other forms of energy as well as 
electricity. Third, another problem exists because of 
low income levels and imperfect markets. 
Even if consumers were willing and able 
to afford the full cost electricity per 
kilowatt hour, they certainly could not 
afford the connection costs. This is called 
the first cost problem. For example, it has 
been estimated that the cost of 
purchasing a small solar home system 
(SHS) would be 61% of a typical rural 
Pakistani household’s annual income. In 
essence, it means that even if consumers 
would benefit or save money by paying 
their monthly electricity bill, they could 
not afford the “first cost” of adopting a 
more electricity intensive consumption 
pattern. With rural Afghanis spending 
the bulk of their income on food, they 
would be unable without some form of 
subsidy to purchase a SHS. This leads 
many countries to subsidize connection 
costs even if they do not subsidize 
consumption or to provide other forms of 
concessional financing. 
 Fourth, even when the first cost problem 
is overcome, the low population density 
coupled with the low income and low 
demand, will mean that either: (a) the 
consumption will need to be met by small 
modular units like solar; or (b) that a base 
load needs to be identified and developed 
such as a school or clinic or a larger scale 
economic use such as milling or 
irrigation. 
 Fifth, where incomes and consumption 
are unlikely to support electricity, then 
rural electrification may need to focus on 
finding or creating a customer that can 
act as the base load as well as subsidize 
the other users28. Then, productive uses 
of electricity that will reduce costs, 
increase incomes or both. This must be 
the cornerstone for most rural 
electrification activities. It also means 
that this productive use will subsidize 
other consumers. Productive use here 
 
28 This subsidization can be indirect in that the increase 
consumption allows economies of scale in supply and 
lower costs. For example, the project sponsor identifies 
the use of electricity for a grain mill and then uses mini 
hydro instead of solar. This will result in lower costs of 
production for all users. The subsidization can be direct 
when the base load use pays more than its marginal 
supply costs, thereby lowering the amount needed to be 
d fth
can be defined as either income 
generating activities such as milling or 
irrigation or end use in clinics or schools. 
 There is an important difference between 
these two types of productive uses. In the first 
case, the productive uses are those that have 
economic impacts in the near term and those 
act to increase consumption and ability to pay 
because the demand for electricity grows as 
income increases. This first case impacts rural 
electrification in two ways. First, it acts as a 
base load with the consequent reductions in 
the cost of supply. Second, in the near term it 
increases economic activity in the area and 
increases demand due to the positive spillover 
effects. In the second case, those that consume 
education and health services will see an 
economic impact but it is usually in the distant 
future. The second use can benefit rural 
electrification by acting as a base load and 
reducing costs in that manner. All of this 
leads to some important implications for the 
third prong of the energy strategy. One, focus 
on income generating activities, Two, 
determine the type of energy and amount of 
energy best suited for that specific income 
generating activity. Three, follow an 
integrated model that combines energy 
provision with that of other services. The 
Global Village Energy Partnership provides an 
excellent platform for sharing experiences and 
lessons learned. 
Finally, and most importantly, Afghanistan 
needs a program focused on rural energy 
needs as opposed to focusing on rural 
electrification and one that is focused on 
appropriate technology 
The fourth prong is new supply of energy 
such as new investment in transmission, 
generation or distribution assets. It is 
principally concerned with the grid connected 
systems – generation, transmission and 
distribution assets. Priority activities here 
remain the NEPS and SEPS and the activities 
in other energy sub sectors that support them. 
The overall policy framework for the sector is: 
1. Restructured energy sector governance 
and commercialized operations 
2. Rehabilitation and expansion of the Afghan 
public power grid 3. Expansion of rural energy and electricity 
services 
4. Promotion of private investment to develop 
indigenous energy resources (including 
renewable, natural gas, coal and oil) 
1 Public Power Grid. Emphasis on improved 
distribution and transmission of power will 
require funding from international donors and 
provides opportunity for private investment. 
Capacity building of Afghan staff to operate 
and maintain the system is essential. 
2 Oil, Natural Gas, Coal. Immediate call for 
tenders to explore and develop known 
coal/natural gas reserves, noticeably for 
power, may be conducted.. 
3 Liquid Fuels. There is no plan to divest or 
assess the Liquid Fuels Enterprise under the 
Ministry of Commerce and Industries. 
Operating some 1600 gas pump stations and 
1300 fuel trucks should provide considerable 
opportunity for private investment, improved 
quality of product and competitive pricing. 
Renewable Energy. There is not a coordinated 
approach in place to support the development 
of renewable energy sources. A number of 
small renewable projects are underway, many 
are affiliates of larger programs – i.e., 
alternative livelihood programs in poppy 
growing regions. Use of solar water heating 
and lighting, water pumping and micro-hydro 
can be expanded and privately operated. In 
rural locations, communities have gathered 
resources to construct small hydro and limited 
solar facilities that support minimal but 
important light and small power supply. More 
emphasis required. 
NEEDS ASSESSMENT 
Several needs assessments have been carried 
out. They fall into two broad categories. The 
first category projects demand and supply or 
given an assumption about economic growth, 
investigates how demand and supply will 
respond. The second category is prescriptive 
in nature that is it is based upon some policy 
variables and sets targets about how the sector 
should respond. For example, it sets a rate of 
household connections as a target and then 
uses Government policies and control of the 
sector to move towards that target. Each of 
these is useful but one major drawback is that 
ALL have been at the sub-sector level. “These 
studies have primarily focused on individual 
energy subsectors such as power or oil and 
gas, in some specific instances illuminating 
important aspects of the strategic development 
of the energy sector in the overall context of 
Afghanistan’s development agenda. At the 
same time, the sub-sector-based approach, 
while necessary to adequately address the 
technical complexities of the energy sector, has 
not captured the inter-related nature of energy 
sector developmental issues and, 
consequently, the trade-offs that may be 
entailed in the strategic decision-making 
process.”29 This is a consequence of the 
fragmenting of energy across institutions and 
the lack of comprehensive, integrated 
planning policies and procedures. In reality, 
no energy sub-sector can stand on its own but 
is highly dependent upon what transpires in 
the other sub-sectors. For example, a forecast 
of the demand and supply of hydrocarbons 
that does not at the least consider the demand 
and supply of electricity, a major consumer of 
hydrocarbons, will surely miss the mark. 
While as an academic exercise this may have 
little consequence, nothing can be further from 
reality when scarce human, institutional and 
financial resources are required to develop an 
optimal mix. In short, the failure to forecast 
and analyze on an integrated sectoral basis 
means suboptimal investment plans and 
operating conditions, and a lower rate of 
economic growth than would otherwise have 
happened. Thus, an Overall Energy Sector 
Needs Assessment does not exist and at this 
will be simply an aggregate of the individual 
sub-sector needs assessments. 
ELECTRICITY 
The Afghanistan Compact developed at the 
London Conference in Jan-Feb 2006 defined 
energy benchmarks for Afghanistan: 
“By end-2010: electricity will reach at least 65% of 
households and 90% of nonresidential 
establishments in major urban areas and at least 
25% of households in rural areas; at least 75% of 
the costs will be recovered from users connected 
to the national power grid. A strategy for the 
development and use of renewable energies will 
be developed by end-2007.” 
To achieve these goals, IROA and donor 
assistance has focused on actions to 
 
29 World Bank Afghanistan Energy Sector Strategy 
2005 rehabilitate hydro and thermal generating 
facilities; increase power imports and develop 
PPAs with Central Asian countries; purchase 
small diesel generating sets for supplementing 
power supply in selected urban areas; develop 
selected transmission lines to maximize 
deliverability from domestic generation 
sources and increase use of imported power; 
and develop micro-hydro and other energy 
resources in rural and remote areas. Through 
these combined efforts, the supply of 
electricity throughout Afghanistan has 
increased by 66% albeit from a very low 
base.A key objective of these initiatives is to 
increase the number of connections, adding 
about 850,000 residential and non-residential 
connections by 2010 to increase access in 
urban areas from an estimated 27% currently 
to 65% by 2010 ; and, country-wide from 6% 
currently to almost 25 % by 2010. By 2015 the 
goal is to increase urban access to 90% and 
achieve an overall national access rate of 33%.

Notes: 33% annual growth in customers; $1,000 cost per customer connection;800 watts peak demand 
per customer. 
The estimated cost of increasing customer 
access to electric power to meet Afghanistan 
Compact goals is $853 million for the period 
2006 to 2010. In addition, the cost of 
expanding generating supplies (domestic and 
imported) is approximately $400 million. 
Therefore, on this basis the funding needed to 
meet Afghanistan Compact goals would be 
about $1.2 billion for the period 2006-201030, 
excluding the costs of developing the energy 
supplies when indigenous resources are used. 
Meeting these goals in relation to existing 
budget constraints necessitates developing an 
overall Energy Sector Strategy that will 
identify least-cost options to meeting sector 
requirements in the longer-term; maximize the 
benefits of IROA and donor initiatives; and 
increase participation and investment by the 
private sector.Information on Afghanistan’s 
energy situation is constrained by a serious 
lack of good quality data. This hampers efforts 
to develop and implement a clear sector 
strategy. For example, ANDS goals are clear in 
the benchmarks that are to be met by 2010, 
including the percentage of urban and rural 
households and non-residential 
establishments with access to electricity and 
 
30 Ministry Strategy (With Focus on Prioritization); 
Miitf Ed WtStb302006
75% of the cost of power recovered through 
tariffs. However, data on the number of 
households in Afghanistan, on their income 
and consumption patterns and overall energy 
demand generally is not available or is of very 
poor quality. The same situation exists for 
non-residential establishments; for the cost of 
power delivered by DABM; and the cost of 
improving revenue collection in order to 
recover costs from customers. Until data 
collection and analysis capabilities are 
improved, the costs of meeting the ANDS 
benchmarks cannot be known with any 
certainty. Given this gap, the Energy Sector 
Strategy proposes to develop better quality 
and more complete data and modeling 
capabilities that are crucial to effective 
planning and to achievement of Afghanistan’s 
overall national economic and energy sector 
goals. In this regard, a recent report prepared 
for USAID estimated electricity demand for 
Afghanistan for the period 2010-1020 needed 
to meet ANDS objectives31.

Based on available data and information, the

This analysis indicates that total electricity 
generation needed in 2010 is 1,519.1 MW, 
while MEW estimates that available 
generating capacity in 2010 will be about 1,200 
MW. This indicates a potential shortage of 
supply of about 320 MW. The data also show a 
need for an additional 917 MW by 2015. 
PRIORITY POLICIES AND 
OBJECTIVES 
Following from the broad objectives above 
and using the four prong strategy approach, 
priority policies to support implementation of 
the Sector Vision have been put forward. This 
section provide more detail on elements for 
an Afghanistan Energy Sector Strategy, 
including those that address overall energy 
sector needs (e.g., prioritizing projects based 
on a cost-benefit analysis) as well as sectorspecific elements (e.g., electricity tariff reform 
and completion of the Sheberghan gas field 
development). The intent is for this Strategy to 
provide overall guidance on achieving 
Afghanistan’s energy sector goals in a timely 
and cost-effective manner and to address five 
primary areas: 
Adopt policy that: 
1. Recognizes the priority of electricity supply 
projects and develop the mechanism to ensure 
coordination among the other Government entities as required. This means viewing 
electricity supply projects on an integrated 
basis so that development of fuel supply and 
other required infrastructure is an integral 
part of the electricity project. 
prioritizes projects on the basis of their time 
and cost focusing on: 
 Reducing technical losses in transmission 
and distribution. 
 Reducing demand through end use 
efficiency such as CFLs. 
 Metering of existing cross border 
transmission. 
 Expanding transmission capacity to 
neighboring countries. 
 Rehabilitating the Sheberghan gas fields 
and construction of its solar power plant. 
 Develop New Hydro capacity. 
 And investment in oil, natural gas and 
coal infrastructure based on tenders using 
performance contracts and a permitting 
system. 
(Greater detail on these and other priority 
programs are presented in detail in the subsector strategy areas.) 
Energy Sector Governance is the single most 
important issue for the long run health of the 
sector. The enabling frameworks and 
implementing rules and regulations need to 
be established along best practice guidelines. 
Activities include: 
3.Develop and adopt a modern, 
comprehensive energy law and then separate 
laws for electricity, oil and natural gas. 
Concurrently develop the implementing rules 
and regulations. 
4.Adopt in policy and embody in law, the 
principle of private sector provision of energy. 
The overarching energy law should explicitly 
address the role of the private sector which 
role is further developed in sub-sector law. 
5.Establish a Multi-Sector Regulator for 
electricity, coal, Petroleum and Petroleum 
Products and Water. 
6.Develop an Energy Policy that establish 
guidelines for energy production and 
consumption that is cross sector in nature, e.g. 
energy efficiency, cost recovery, 
environmental issues. The National Energy 
Policy should provide guidance on the role of 
energy in the Nation’s economy and set 
guidelines for how energy will be used. 
7.Establish procedures to ensure effective 
coordination among the different sector 
Government entities and sharing of data by 
these institutions. 
8.Ensure that Government energy entities are 
effective by implementing capacity building 
programs and reorganizing these entities as 
and when their roles change.32 
9.Improve the production and delivery of 
rural energy by clarifying the roles of MEW 
and MRRD and evaluating options for project 
development and ownership, technical 
support and pilot projects based on 
international best practices and attraction of 
private sector participation. 
10.Enhance policy and planning and the 
effectiveness of donor support by 
strengthening Inter-agency cooperation and 
adopting tools that will allow integrated 
planning and analysis. 
11.Develop and deploy tools to evaluate and 
prioritize options such as a least-cost plan. 
12.Improve data collection and analysis. 
13.Establish a comprehensive monitoring and 
evaluation program, and 
14.Improving assistance coordination. 
15.Accelerate private sector provision while an 
effective supporting framework is being put 
into place by such measures as: 
16.Making an unequivocal commitment to 
involving the private sector including an 
aggressive time-table for action. 
17.Recognizing that in the long run diesel 
power is too expensive but, in short run, it 
 
32 As the private sector takes on increasingly 
more aspects of energy, Government’s role 
will change to one of planning, policy and 
ltimay serve as a stop gap measure. Explore a 
limited term IPP for diesel, say five years. 
This meets the immediate objective of getting 
power while developing some expertise in 
negotiation and power contractual 
instruments. It also has the advantage of 
restricting diesel power to a limited time 
period, time in which lower cost power can 
come on line. 
18.Issuing tenders for private investment in 
IPPs based on a ceiling bulk power tariff 
(avoided cost) or some other method that 
might promote more competition in cost, and 
a “one-stop shop” window at the MEW. 
19.using “regulation by contract,” 
management performance contracts and “light 
handed regulation” concepts33; 
20.Issuing tenders for coal sector development 
based on a permitting system. 
21.Expediting the commercialization of Stated 
owned Enterprises such as DABM; and, 
22.Outsourcing activities now that can 
immediately benefit from private sector 
involvement such as meter reading and billing 
Establish a commercially oriented financial 
environment by: 
 Increasing tariffs (while maintain a life 
line rate or mechanism) 
 Public awareness programs providing 
information about the link between the 
cost of energy and its availability. 
 GoA to pay subsidy directly to the Utility 
 Establish subsidized tariffs for the poor 
and ensure that they are targeted 
 Require both Governments to pay the 
utility for all power that is has purchased 
and require the utility to settle its 
accounts with other Government entities. 
Given the initial hardship that this could 
impose, reconcile the accounts up to the

A. Objectives
1 Reform of Sector Governance. This strategy 
supports the consolidation of energy planning 
and policy-making functions through the 
Inter-ministerial Commission for Energy (ICE) 
as well as improved line ministry staff 
capacity to plan and budget. The law of 
hydrocarbons was referred to the Parliament 
for probe into and approval while its 
regulations are still underway in MoJ that 
upon its enforcement, appropriate ground will 
be prepared for participation of private sector 
in this section. 
2 Institutional Reforms, A new market 
paradigm is being supported for Afghan 
energy; significant institutional changes and 
relevant staff capacity is required. 
 Inter-Ministerial Commission for 
Energy (ICE). Support of the government 
sponsored institution brings together the 
seven energy-relevant ministries, donors 
and private sector to review priority 
energy development aspects. Offices for 
ICE are established.
 Sector Regulation. Significant change in 
how the sector is regulated is required. 
Steps are underway in hydrocarbons and 
more is required in electricity and liquid 
fuels.
 Line Ministries. As the energy line 
ministries shift from operating as 
production based to become policymaking regulatory agencies, staff capacity 
and in-house functions will need to be 
reoriented to market practices. 
 Ministry of Finance. In order to ensure 
that the introduction of market-based 
contracting, a predictable royalty regime 
and tax payments are inherent to the 
hydrocarbons sector. Liquid fuel and 
petroleum product import aspects as well 
as tariffs for power all need to be 
considered. This strategy supports the 
establishment of a working group (likely 
under ICE) that will operate for 5 years to 
monitor and evaluate the performance of 
the sector vis-à-vis government return. 3 Legal and Regulatory reform and 
standards. Finalization of primary legislative 
and regulatory tools is essential. These include 
mining and hydrocarbons as well as drafting 
legislation for the electricity sector. There are 
no meaningful technical standards for 
operation are in place; these need to be 
urgently developed as well as staff capacity to 
implement them. 
B.4 Commercialization and/or divestiture of 
state and “quasi-state” assets, Development 
of a plan that includes promotion of private 
operations will support a new operational 
market paradigm for the sector. Government 
will immediately assess its sector assets and a 
plan for liquidation, restructuring and 
commercialization or sale. In particular 
Government will provide more support for the 
corporation and commercialization of 
national power operations. 
DESIRED OUTCOMES 
1 Restructured energy sector 
governance/commercialized operations. 
Improved governance can mobilize 
investment, mitigate corrupt practices and 
improve technical quality of energy supply. 
This strategy supports the shifting of 
government as energy producer to energy 
regulator with viable legal and regulatory 
frameworks that include the development of 
market-based power purchase and production 
sharing agreements. Market-based enterprise 
operations will support loss reduction, 
improved billing and collection, market 
procurements and efficient energy practices 
that result in more energy supply and cost 
savings. 
2 Expanded Public Power Grid. Government 
has committed to improved energy access for 
the population. Through a series of large and 
small infrastructure improvements in the 
generation, transmission and distribution of 
electricity throughout the country, this 
objective is becoming a reality. The strategy 
supports the (1) rehabilitation and upgrading 
of Kabul and other key infrastructure areas 
(i.e., distribution – lines, substations, and 
meters); (2) development of the North East 
Power System (NEPS); to be followed by the 
South East Power System (SEPS), Western and 
Eastern Power Systems; (3) construction of 
tiid ltd ditibtif
Uzbek, Tajik and Turkmen power imports. 
The installation of a Dispatch and Control 
system as well as Reactive Power system will 
be under way in 2008. 
3 Increased Access to Rural energy services. 
Micro-hydro, solar, waste and even small 
diesel power and energy generating sources 
will be promoted to improve rural access. 
Commercial operation of these services and 
technical standards will be encouraged to 
ensure cost-recoverability, sustainability and 
safety. 
4 An effective enabling environment for 
private sector investment. A market-friendly 
enabling environment to facilitate private 
investment will be created. Key areas for 
investment in the near term: (1) power 
generation that includes new hydro power, 
natural gas and coal-fired power; (2) power 
distribution including lines, substations and 
metering; (3) power construction and services 
(i.e., outsourcing); (4) exploration and 
exploitation of coal, natural gas and oil; (5) 
installation and operation of rural energy 
services. Commercial contracts in the areas of 
accounting, project finance, legal and 
integrated resource planning will also be 
considered. 
5 Reduced Poverty: Provide essential energy 
supply services that will help private sector 
development, job creation and poverty 
reduction. Investments in Energy sector will 
by itself create direct employment in the 
development of power plants, oil, gas and coal 
fields, the construction of grid systems and the 
commercial operations of the sector. Develop 
small energy installations that are highly 
successful in cost-recovery, and contribute to 
local economic development. Increase 
mobilization of the domestic revenues by 
improving governance in the energy sector, 
and stimulating private sector development. 
Improve public service delivery by providing 
greater access to electricity for urban and rural 
communities, and especially for the schools 
and health institutions. Maintain the subsidies 
for electricity cost for the poorest households.

INPUTS & OUTPUTS 
 Policy actions: important policy actions 
in terms of institutional and capacity 
development, regulation and legislative 
activities and policy measures to support 
implementation of the energy sector’s 
overall goals and priorities and 
achievement of the desired outcomes are: 
(i) integrated energy policy; (ii) 
overarching energy law and redrafting of 
the electricity sub-sector law along with 
the implementing rules and regulations; 
(iii) commercialization of DABM and 
operation on a commercial basis; (iv) 
institutional reform, including creation of 
a National Utility Regulatory 
Commission; (v)accelerate private sector 
provision through explicit policy and 
legislative cover for the private sector; 
(vi) service delivery standards and 
options; (vii) refocus policy to stress 
repair and maintenance, loss reduction 
and commercial operation equally with 
new investment; and, (viii) tariff reform 
with a slow but deliberate phase out. 
 Programs: Key programs to support 
implementation of the energy sector’s 
goals and priorities and achievement of 
the desired outcomes are discussed 
briefly below and in greater detail in 
Section V. The overall public investment 
need for the next five years is ??? The 
financing gap that will need to be covered 
externally (donors and private 
investments) is. A detailed list of 
programs, sub-programmes and projects 
is part of the Sector Investment Program 
(Annex II). 
 Indicative costs 
 The energy sector program is projected to 
cost USD billion, or about USD m per 
year over. Funding is committed Leaving 
a balance 
This section presents Major Programs and 
Projects by prong or focus area. 
PRONG ONE – EFFICIENT OPERATION 
OF INFRASTRUCTURE 
 Fast Track Commercialization of DABM. 
Work here will also provide a model for 
commercialization of other SOEs in the 
energy sector. Begin loss reduction 
programs including metering of retail 
customers. 
 Procure spare parts and fuel 
 Repair existing transmission and 
distribution systems including 
rehabilitating and/or upgrading 
substations and distribution networks for 
towns under NEPS main transmission 
lines (estimated cost, US $120 M), Kabul 
distribution grid reconstruction and 
extension (estimated cost, US $ 250-300 
M) 
 Install meters for cross border 
transmission 
 Repair existing thermal plants 
 National Energy Conservation Program 
(NECP),34 and (iv) implement 
complementary activities to achieve its 
targets which may include such measures 
as demand side management and other 
best practice energy efficiency measures. 
For details of projects refer to annex III. 
PRONG TWO – SECTOR 
GOVERNANCE 
 Improved GOA, Donor & NGO 
Coordination. Effective assistance and 
achievement of long-term sector goals 
and sustainability require effective 
coordination and cooperation among all 
stakeholders. Donor planning on an 
individual basis is well developed; 
however, integration of donor plans with 
firm commitments for funding and well 
 
34 To economize for cost-savings, people in Kabul 
have started using fluorescent bulbs (also called 
white bulbs), 8,11 and 18 watts; these produce as 
much light as 60-100 watts (regular) bulbs. White 
bulbs also do not produce heat and have a longer 
life, 6 months or more. However, white bulbs are 
expensive; 18 watts costs 120 Afs, as compared to 20 
Affl100 tt blbdefined integration with energy sector 
ministries and other stakeholders needs 
to be improved. Specific attention needs 
to be paid to these issues within the ICE 
to ensure that ANDS goals are met 
efficiently and on time. 
 Reduce Subsidies and cross-subsidies in 
both power and fuel. This will be done so 
in a way that matches improvements in 
the sector and recognizes the hardships 
that quick withdrawal of the subsidy 
could have. Universal service obligations 
should be directly funded through 
Government payments to the utility. 
Subsidies are an important and integral tool of 
Government policy. Energy subsidies that 
provide a basic level of energy services to the 
poor exist in almost every country. So the 
issue it not whether there should be subsidies 
but rather who gets the subsidy and the how 
the subsidy is provided. Subsidies need to be 
identified and made transparent during the 
restructuring process and removed. 
In 2004/05, the average tariff collected by 
DABM was only five cents/kWh, compared to 
an average unit cost of power production of 
about 12 cents/kWh. Currently, power 
subsidies cost the government $56 M/year, 
which is unsustainable and undesirable. 
Assistance is required to review the existing 
tariffs and develop a targeted subsidy plan 
and a phase-in plan for subsidy reduction. 
Assistance will need to include a public 
outreach program. This could be one of the 
first tasks of the regulator (See below). 
 Capacity Building. Current efforts to 
train IROA energy personnel lack 
coordination and effectiveness. A 
comprehensive vocational training 
program to ensure future human 
resources adequate for the energy 
sector and to demonstrate evidence of 
a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary 
and multi-ministry approach by the 
IROA is required. Development of an 
Afghanistan Vocational Training 
Center is needed. The recently 
established National Capacity 
Building Program may be the proper 
entity to accomplish this task. 
Training will also support the 
commercialization of DABM and 
other energy sector SOEs. 
Additionally, all SOEs need training 
in basic management, accounting and 
finance.
 Improved Sector Governance. Currently, 
energy sector governance is spread 
among numerous IROA Ministries, 
agencies, and SOEs where effective 
coordination often is lacking. 
Moreover, the roles and 
responsibilities of IROA entities will 
change as sector restructuring and 
private participation advances and 
the role of the Government evolves 
from direct sector intervention to 
oversight and regulatory functions. 
Actions to privatize SOEs need to be 
completed and the IROA needs to 
review the roles and responsibilities 
of Ministries and other IROA entities 
in light of the structure and 
expanding private sector role within 
the sector. Consolidation of functions 
and re-definement of roles and 
responsibilities among IROA entities 
needs to be addressed. Improved 
governance is more than just properly 
aligning Ministries and IROA entities. 
It includes the establishment of sector 
regulation, the increased role of the 
private sector, and integrated policy 
and planning. Almost all major reviews 
of the energy sector or sub-sectors 
conclude that it would be best to 
consolidate all energy operations under 
one Ministry, a Ministry of Energy. This 
is something that needs to be considered 
in the intermediate term. 
A. Legal and Regulatory 
Reform Program.  
Currently, there is only an embryonic legal 
and regulatory framework for the Afghanistan 
energy sector, which is insufficient to support 
restructuring and private investment. The 
laws are silent with regard to private 
provision of energy. This lack of explicit basis 
for the private sector will serve to increase risk 
and cost and delay the entrance of the private sector in a meaningful way. Norway is 
providing assistance to redraft the 
hydrocarbons law and it will be completed 
soon. Drafting of an overarching energy law 
and the electricity sector law is a top priority. 
Government needs to make an unequivocal 
commitment to involving the private sector 
including an aggressive timetable for action. 
Amend the law to restructure the energy sector 
with a strict timetable specifically mentioning (a) 
sector restructuring, and (b) private provision of 
energy.35
Establish a multi-sector regulatory body 
(water, electricity, coal, and petroleum) 
independent of the energy related ministries. 
This program would support the creation 
and ongoing operation of a new 
Government Entity to regulate the sector. 
To jump start the process, a shadow 
regulator would be created composed of 
expect staff in key positions to actually 
perform day-to-day functions and train 
local staff on both on-the-job training and 
formal training. As local staff is trained, 
expert assistance would be reduced. This 
serves the purpose of immediately 
providing regulatory assistance in country 
to establish the necessary frameworks and 
provide “guidance” so as to create a 
favorable environment for the private 
sector. 
The lack of a regulator, independent from the 
Ministries that deal with energy, is an obstacle 
to efficient operation of the sector even if the 
operations are under Government control. 
Because of the importance of catalyzing 
private sector provision of these services 
(water, electricity and natural gas), the 
regulator needs to begin using a more 
French/Arabic model of regulation and evolve 
with the sector over time. Emphasis needs to 
be on acting as a watchdog of SOE 
commercialization and performance 
improvement, and providing the early 
technical input into the contracts used with 
private sector entities. One of the first 
 
35 Private provision is a catchall phrase that is used 
to convey all the possible ways of involving the 
private sector from management contracts through 
thltd tibthitt
activities could be to develop modern 
production sharing agreements. Develop and 
implement the organizational structure and 
staffing plan for NURC. 
Recognizing the time to enact legislation and 
establish an effective regulatory authority, it may be 
appropriate to accelerate the process through a 
Presidential Decree that would establish the 
regulatory authority while legal and administrative 
issues are being resolved. 
B. Private Sector Provision 
Program. 
As mentioned earlier, the country can no 
longer wait to actively begin attracting the 
private sector to the energy sector. The 
enabling legislation, policy and regulation will 
addressed through other efforts. This 
program is to establish a Public-Private 
Partnership Office to facilitate increased 
private sector involvement in the 
infrastructure areas beginning first with the 
energy sector. At a later date, it could focus on 
non-infrastructure reas. It would be housed in 
the Ministry of? And be responsible for 
developing the laws and implementing rules 
and regulations that are not specific to any 
sector but rather cross cutting, such as 
concession law or a BOT law. The PPP office 
would also develop prototype commercial 
instruments such as contracts, developing a 
tendering system that would be run by the 
PPP office on behalf of client Ministries or 
SOEs. 
Develop and implement the organizational 
structure and staffing plan for PPP Office. 
This needs to be accompanied by a shadow 
expat staff to provide additional resources and 
critical on-the-job training. 
Reforms that lead to transparency, fair 
competition, a functioning legal framework, 
and rule-of-law can meaningfully bring 
private sector participation. For electricity, 
private sector can be mobilized through the 
use of: Independent Power Producers (IPP’s), 
Management and Maintenance Contracts, 
Concessions, Build, Operate, Transfer (BOT) 
and Full Privatization of Assets, the highest 
extent of privatization. As a start, DABM will outsource Works 
and Services and Billing/Meter reading. 
In the works and services area, the utility 
will no longer undertake construction and 
rehabilitation but will give them under 
tender to the private sector. Other areas 
that will be encouraged include O&M 
contracts. Moreover, when 
commercialization is complete and 
distribution unbundled in an accounting 
sense, DABM will seek a performance 
based management contract for 
distribution. In the regulatory arena, our 
strategy includes: establishing enabling 
environment including commercial and 
power-sector specific contract laws such 
as for dispute resolution. Moreover, 
functioning courts can be an important 
enabler to attract private sector 
investments. It is proposed to create a 
Minimum Infrastructure Platform (MIP)36
for private sector led growth. 
Given the on-going power infrastructure 
activities, including those planned, under 
proper regulatory environment and 
security conditions, over time, selectively, 
there is a good potential for the 
privatization of power. While a great deal 
of success has been achieved in the 
telecom sector, a key difference is the 
public’s perception that providing power 
is the government’s responsibility, and 
also much higher costs of power 
infrastructure as compared to telecom. 
Nevertheless, areas such as concessions 
and licenses can be looked into for 
potential use. 
Some of the privatization areas that will 
be investigated are: (i) Equipment and 
human resource supply to power 
construction and rehabilitation projects, 
(ii) Owning and operating small and 
 
36 Proposed MIP is a comination of elements including: 
(i) business environment; (ii) investment facilitation; 
(iii) human capital; (iv) financial services; (v) Power 
sector-specific laws including dispute resolution, and (vi) 
Phil d t iftt
medium sized stand-alone grids,37 (iii) 
Management/maintenance contracts for 
regional power programs and major 
power plants, (iv) The installation and 
operation of alternative energy sources 
(solar and wind installations), potentially 
with subsidies in the short- and mediumterms, (v) For the longer term, through 
unbundling and divestiture of power 
generation plants which could operate as 
stand alone units that sell power to the 
grid, and (vi) over the longer term (2015 
or beyond), subsidized development of 
coal fired power plants to support major 
industry such as mining. 
Security remains an important issue 
including for private sector participation 
and operation. To reduce security-related 
risks, the Government is increasingly 
implementing corrective measures 
including increased security, creating 
employment opportunities and 
apprehending criminals. 
Additional regulatory improvements are 
also underway to lower risks to the 
private sector. Also, the public will be 
educated to help accept privatization, as it 
is gradually phased in. MEW will work 
towards improving the regulatory 
framework to reduce risks and costs. 
IROA is committed to encouraging and 
increasing private sector role in power. 
C. Integrated Policy and 
Planning. 
It is imperative that the energy sector be seen 
from an integrated point of view and that the 
Ministries and Agencies involved in energy 
coordinate their policy and planning exercises 
so that the complex interactions among subsectors are adequately considered. This will 
result in a more optimal allocation of 
resources and a more effective capital 
investment planning process. ICE needs to be 
 
37 The Omary Electric Company in Ghazni serves 8,500 
customers with 24 hour electricity and only 42 staff 
(compared to DABM in Ghazni who serve 1,460 
tith 5 hf lf29 tff)strengthened both institutionally and from a 
capacity point of view for this critical work. 
D. Least‐Cost Expansion Plan  
based on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. As 
the coordinating institution for the energy 
sector, it is recommended that ICE undertake 
development of a Least-Cost Expansion Plan to 
achieve IROA objectives for the sector over the 
next 2-to-10-year period within overall budget 
constraints. This plan would utilize and 
expand upon current economic models 
developed through USAID-funded assistance 
to evaluate current and proposed projects and 
be updated on a regular basis. Based on this 
analysis, a comprehensive expansion plan for 
Afghanistan’s energy resources—including 
electricity, natural gas, oil, coal and 
renewables—would be drafted, vetted and put 
into place; and would include a detailed 
monitoring and evaluation program, 
indicating objectives, benchmarks, and 
reporting requirements. This plan would 
include capacity building; regulatory, legal 
and legislative reforms; private sector 
initiatives, and other programs needed to 
achieve ANDS objectives, in addition to 
specific projects to rehabilitate and expand 
energy sector infrastructure. It would 
prioritize projects and programs according to 
short-term (2-to-5 years) and intermediateterm (5-to-10 years) requirements given 
overall IROA and donor budget constraints. 
As the implementing and coordinating entity, 
ICE could assign specific projects and 
programs to individual ministries and entities. 
This Plan should review: 
 What is the optimal balance over time of 
domestic energy production from hydro, 
natural gas, oil, coal, renewable resources 
and energy conservation? 
 What is the least-cost balance over time 
between domestic versus imported 
energy? 
 What is the optimal balance over time of 
energy resource use for rural energy 
services? 
 Given resource constraints, what is the 
optimal balance over time of IROA versus 
private sector involvement in the energy 
sector, including rural energy? 
What policy, institutional, legal and 
legislative reforms are needed to develop 
a sustainable energy sector with private 
sector participation? 
 What studies and data and informational 
resources are needed to fill gaps in 
understanding and knowledge of the 
sector and to support development of an 
effective energy sector strategy? 
 What is an effective strategy to increase 
participation, build support, and 
maintain realistic expectations among 
sector stakeholders with regard to 
assistance efforts? 
E. Needs Assessment and Data 
Base.  
The IROA should undertake a detailed needs 
assessment and develop a comprehensive data 
base for the Afghanistan energy sector, 
including information on energy use by 
various categories of consumers (households, 
commercial, small and large industry, 
transportation); options for meeting sector 
demand; rural and urban household 
information, economic growth, level and 
structure of energy demand, rates of 
population growth and urbanization; energy 
cost and availability; etc. This information 
would be used to create a comprehensive data 
base to support achievement of Afghanistan’s 
long-term energy sector objectives located at 
the Afghanistan Energy Information Center 
(AEIC). 
 Project Management Unit. These energy 
projects and programs are so large and 
institutional capacity at implementing 
entities so thin that is it imperative that a 
Project Management Unit be established 
to handle all project management aspects 
including monitoring and evaluation. The 
PMU would work with ICE and the 
implementing entities to develop a 
comprehensive project management 
program that would be applied to the 
largest and most critical projects. At the 
time, the capability to monitor and 
evaluate would be strengthened at the 
ICE and implementing entities 
addressing all other assistance efforts not 
brought under the PMU. It is critical that 
efforts to rebuild and expand 
Afghanistan’s energy sector, to strengthen energy sector institutions and 
to attract private sector investment be as 
effective and efficient as possible. Current 
efforts have produced some important 
results, but efforts need to be 
strengthened, particularly with regard to 
rural energy programs, to ensure that 
projects are completed on time, that they 
produce the desired results and that they 
contribute to Afghanistan’s sustainable 
energy future. For details of projects refer 
to annex III. 
PRONG THREE – RURAL AND 
RENEWABLE ENERGY 
Amend electricity law to clearly demarcate the 
boundaries between MEW and MRRD with 
respect to rural energy; concentrate ruralremote energy activities within the Rural 
Livelihoods and Energy Department (RLED). 
It is important to more clearly define the areas 
of control between the MRRD and MEW in 
providing energy services. MEW is 
principally concerned with providing 
electricity services to: (1) urban and periurban areas; (2) secondary towns and cities of 
5,000 persons or more; and, (3) large 
industrial, mining, commercial or agroindustries. To more accurately reflect these 
differences, the distinction between rural 
energy and rural-remote will be made 
following the Bangladesh experience. 
Rural-remote energy is energy that serves 
remote communities of a village or village and 
where the settlement is less than 5,000 persons 
that is a reasonable distance from a 
transmission line, or an urban or peri-urban 
area or any other area that would be covered 
by MEW. This is the clear domain of MRRD 
and this may include conventional energy 
such as diesel, liquid fuels, and coal and it 
may include small scale renewable such as 
biogas and micro or mini hydro. 
While demarcating clearer lines of authority 
for energy services, this does not reduce the 
need for the two ministries to collaborate. The 
need to collaborate arises for many reasons 
such as: The MEW will have expertise in 
renewable energy, albeit large scale, that may 
be of use to MRRD; Eventually, some of the 
MRRD areas will connect to the grid and so a 
common understanding of the requirements 
for grid connection is require; and, there is a 
need to collaborate on technical standards for 
rural electrification. 
 Coordinate donor assistance activities for 
rural-remote energy through RLED. 
 In collaboration with NURC, develop 
Rural-remote Energy Policy and include
Light Handed Regulation as an official 
policy to promote development of standalone rural energy systems. Policy and 
regulation must set guidelines for costrecovery. In essence projects need to be 
able to recover operation and 
maintenance costs and set aside a sinking 
fund for capital replacement. 
 Undertake a Rural Energy Master Plan 
for rural-remote and develop criteria for 
project selection based on the policy of 
income generation and cost recovery and 
on the master plan and do so in 
coordination with MEW as their rural 
electrification plan is developed. 
 Develop and implement the 
organizational structure and staffing plan 
for RLED. This needs to be accompanied 
by a shadow ex pat staff to do the heavy 
lifting and provide critical on-the-job 
training. 
 Establish the Rural Energy Fund 
administered by RLED and allocated on 
the basis criteria developed above. 
MEW to develop a rural electrification master 
plan to cover their area of control and 
coordinate it with the MRRD. For details of 
projects refer to annex III. 
PRONG FOUR - EXPAND 
SUPPLY 
Imports from neighboring countries expanded 
– 
Establishment of a Dispatch and Control 
Center (US $25 M) 
Power Purchase Agreements for Power 
Imports – Strengthening Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPA’s) with Afghanistan’s 
suppliers to assure guaranteed supplies at agreed upon costs and quality38. This is a top 
priority activity that cuts across several MEW 
projects and is critical to additional power 
needs. It is currently covered under an 
existing USAID project. Focus needs to be on 
non-western style PPAs that are consistent 
with the Central-South Asia way of doing 
business. 
(1) NORTH EAST POWER 
SYSTEM (NEPS) 
NEPS is the most important supply effort 
consisting of generation, transmission and 
distribution. It includes a 100 MW power plant 
based on indigenous natural gas39 and power 
imports. . NEPS’s primary objective is to serve 
urban centers in Kabul, Nangarhar, Parwan, 
Balkh, Jawzjan, Kunduz and Baghlan. The 
transmission lines to transmit imported power 
from Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and 
Tajikistan to major urban centers in the North 
and East, in particular Kabul are being 
completed on a priority basis. The completion 
will help meet the existing shortfall on quicker 
basis. 
In addition to the 100 MW gas fired 
generation, NEPS will also include the 
rehabilitation of Hydropower plants (HPPs) in 
Pul-i-Chumri and Khanabad in the North, and 
Naghlu, Saurobi and Mahipar in the east. The 
generated power will feed through the NEPS. 
For the long-term, 15 years and beyond, it is 
proposed to establish new hydro power plants 
in Baghdara and a second plant in Saurobi; 
pre-feasibility studies for these hydro plants 
have been completed. In addition, a 
transmission line will also be extended from 
Kabul to Logar and Gardez 
 
38 Currently, PPAs are skeletal and include no terms 
concerning technical quality, quality of service, or 
metering. In addition, MOU with Tajikistan has not 
been finalized. 
39 Estimated gas reserves available as of 2006: 1197.17 
billion, current demand including for the 100 MW 
power plant is estimated at 21.09 billion ft3; Expected life 
of gas reserves, 56 years. Plant operational target date: 
lt2008
(2 REHABILITATION OF 
SHEBERGHAN GAS FIELDS 
AND POWER PLANT. 
Afghanistan needs to develop indigenous 
energy resources, including natural gas 
reserves in the Sheberghan area. Data on gas 
reserves indicate that there is sufficient lowcost gas reserves available to operate a 
combined cycle turbine plant at Sheberghan 
for 25 years and that the cost per kWh of 
power generated would be in the 2.8 to 3.5 
cent range. While this is more expensive than 
the cost of imported power, which currently is 
in the 2.0 to 2.5 cents/kWh range, future 
prices are expected to be 4.0 cents/kWh or 
more. Also, it is important to note the 
domestic benefits resulting from developing 
the gas fields and gas-fired power plant. 
USAID is exploring options for some funding 
of a 100MW gas-fired power plant to be 
located near the Khwoja Gegertak, Jarkaduk 
and Yatimtaq gas fields and an associated urea 
plant. USAID is confirming the sufficient size 
of the reserves, quality of the gas and delivery 
prospects for the plant and plans to move 
forward with construction of the generating 
plant pending results of these assessments. 
A high priority for the Energy Sector Strategy 
is to complete assessment of the Sheberghan 
natural gas fields, issue a production sharing 
agreement for development of the fields, 
complete the rehabilitation of the gas pipeline 
and develop the 100 MW Sheberghan gas-fired 
power plant to feed into the NEPS grid. These 
activities should include reviewing options for 
private sector participation in development of 
the power plant, such as a management 
contract and bundling the project with 
rehabilitation and expansion of the gas 
processing and fertilizer plants. Moreover, the 
GOA needs to consider options to attract 
private sector participation and investment in 
the gas sector, including management 
contracts for Afghan Gas, to rehabilitate and 
operate the gas processing facility and to 
expand and operate the fertilizer plant. SOUTH EAST POWER 
SYSTEM (SEPS) 
SEPS aim is to serve urban centers in Helmand 
and Kandahar). It will enhance power supply 
to Kandahar and Helmand by rehabilitating 
two turbines, and by extending a third turbine 
at Kajakai. In addition to enhancing power 
supply, another key aim is to gradually reduce 
reliance on expensive diesel generation. 
Furthermore, MEW will attempt to advance 
the proposed time-frame for the feasibility 
study to expand hydro power production in 
Kajaki through a second dam. 
However, security is a particular concern 
especially in the South-east including Kajakaidam area. In the event it becomes a serious 
threat or an actuality, the Government will 
explore the feasibility of installing, small-scale 
power systems such as decentralized systems, 
mini-grids and others, in areas where security 
becomes a threat. 
RESERVE ESTIMATION AND 
EXPLORATION 
 Increased power generation requires the 
use of indigenous resources of natural gas 
and coal. The Government is committed 
to developing the enabling frameworks 
that will promote private sector 
investment in exploration and 
development of gas reserves and coal. 
Top priority will be given to existing gas 
and coal fields. For details of projects 
refer to annex III. CHAPTER III 
ENERGY SUB-SECTOR STRATEGIES
ELECTRIC POWER 
The goal of the IROA ‘s strategy for the power 
sector is to provide supplies of reliable, 
affordable electric power sufficient to support 
a growth rate in GDP of 9% per year and 
reduce poverty by 3% per year. If these targets 
are met, by 2013 these achievements would 
result in over 90% of residents in the three 
major cities and more than 50% of the rural 
population having electricity. However this 
remains an extremely ambitious 
goal.Hydropower holds the greatest promise 
for Afghanistan followed by natural gas and 
coal. Utilization of indigenous fossil fuels 
(natural gas and coal) for power generation is 
very limited as is utilization of solar, wind and 
other renewable energy resources. 
Figure 9. Cost of Power Under MEW Strategy 
Source: Ministry of Energy and Water. 
Figure 9 shows that the cost of delivered 
power can be significantly reduced through 
efforts by the IROA and MEW to displace 
costly diesel power with other sources, such as 
natural-gas and coal and with lower cost 
power imports. Most of the cost of power is 
associated with generation (as opposed to 
transmission and distribution), so replacing 
costly diesel generation will have a major 
impact on the delivered cost of power 
(seeFigure.8). 
Priority objectives of the Government in 
electricity include: 
 Commercialization of DABM including 
outsourcing and/or privatization some 
functions. 
 Institute a CFL penetration program. 
 Increase operating capacity in 
Afghanistan from 448 MW to 850 MW by 
2012. 
 Increase power distribution in Kabul to 
500 MW by 2013. 
 Increase power distribution in other 
major urban centers by 100 MW by 2013. 
 Provide 100 MW to electrify 25 small 
towns and 800 representative rural households by 2013 (MRRD estimates 
that as of 2006, there were over 38,000 
villages in Afghanistan.). 
 Promote supply of energy services to 
rural and remote areas. 
 Support development of renewable 
energy resources, particularly microhydro, solar and wind. 
 Support institutional strengthening and 
capacity building and private sector 
involvement in the power sector. 
 Tariff reform. 
MEASURES TO INCREASE 
POWER GENERATION AND 
DELIVERY 
Rehabilitation and expansion of power 
generation, low-cost power imports, and 
increased access to rural electricity supply are 
the core components of the IROA ‘s efforts to 
increase accesses to electric power in 
Afghanistan. 
Major efforts by the IROA and donors to 
increase power generation and delivery 
include the following40: 
 Rehabilitation of the NW Kabul thermal 
plant (44MW). 
 Reconstruction of East GT (45MW). 
 Development of a gas-fired generation 
plant at (100MW) 
 Reconstruction of Thermal Power Plant 
50 MW in North West of Kabul 
 Construction of Diesel Power Plant 108 
MW in East of Kabul 
 Power generation activities directed to 
off-grid supply, including micro-hydro 
and solar powered systems, potentially 
adding about 21MW. 
 Installation of 25 diesel generators to help 
meet winter and emergency needs in 
Kabul and Kandahar (21MW). 
 
40 This list is intended to indicate IROA and donor 
activities undertaken to expand availability of electric 
power. The status of these activities often is unclear as to 
whether they have been completed, are being 
iltd hbdld
NorthEast Power System (NEPS) to 
connect Kabul to Pul-e-Khumri with ties 
to Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and 
Turkmenistan for power imports and the 
addition of thermal power through 
indigenous gas at Shebergahan. 
 North Transmission System (NTS), 
including constructing 220kV lines from 
Nahri Shahi (Mazar-e Sharif) to Surkhan 
Daria in Uzbekistan and to Pul-e-Khumri 
and beyond. 
 Eastern Transmission System (ETS) is 
being rehabilitated and strengthened, 
including the existing 110kV lines from 
Kabul to Mahipar, Naghlu and Sarobi. 
 Western Transmission System (WTS) 
includes strengthening the existing 110 
kV line connecting Herat and Mary in 
Turkmenistan and the 132 kV line 
connecting Herat to Taiband. The South 
East Power System (SEPS) which via a 
110kV line connects Kandahar to Lashkar 
Gah and Dural Junction and connects 
Dural Junction to Kajakai. 
 Installation of diesel generation in 
various cities where no alternatives are 
available. 
 For small towns and cities, strengthen 
power availability including: the Qalat 
Electrification Project and the Aybak 
Distribution Project to strengthen 
distribution networks and establish 4,300 
new connections in rural areas; microhydro projects in various parts of the 
country; limited wind energy projects 
(such as in Herat, with over 120 days of 
potentially strong winds); and an 
estimated 200 small biogas digesters in 
Kandahar. 
Longer-term initiatives that might be 
undertaken between 2012 and 2020 might 
eventually include some of the following: 
 Developing a national grid, and 
becoming a power transit country; plus 
the following specific projects 
 Kajakai 2 (100 MW) and Saurobi 2 (180 
MW) hydropower development. 
 Kokcha hydro cascase, (perhaps up to 
1000 MW) 
 Baghdara (280 MW) Kunar, (300 MW) 
 Panshir (Gulbahar) (120 MW); 
 Possible hydro projects in Bali Murghab 
and Balkh, with currently unknown 
capacities; and 
 Perhaps one or more coal power facilities 
with a capacity of up to 350 MW. 
These activities will take some time to 
complete. New generation to serve the Kabul 
area is not expected to be available until 
December, 2008, including delivery of 
expanded power imports from Central Asia. 
Completion of the Sheberghan power plant 
depends on completion of the resource 
assessment and finalizing the production 
sharing agreements; development of other 
resources options, such as coal-fired 
generation or new hydro plants, depends on 
completing a number of ongoing initiatives 
designed to clarify the roles and 
responsibilities of the IROA and developers 
and to reduce to manageable levels the risks 
and uncertainties associated with 
development of these resources. In addition, a 
recent analysis of the sector indicates a 
potential electricity supply shortfall in 2010 of 
about 320 MW, or perhaps more, depending 
on how ‘demand is defined.’ Currently most 
customers receive some power some of the 
time. There seems to be latent demand for far 
more power than is planned for any time in 
the foreseeable future. 
Institutional, Regulatory and Legislative 
Policy Requirements 
While physical improvements to the power 
structure are underway, simultaneously 
initiatives are being taken to build institutional 
and implementation capacity across relevant 
power sector entities many of which will 
increase transparency. Such efforts include: 
 Strengthening institutional capacity at 
MEW, MRRD and MoM to be completed 
by 2015. 
 Technical training of technicians and 
engineers at DABM in power sector 
infrastructure maintenance; management 
courses and training in procurement, 
billing and collection and other areas. 
 Efforts to unbundle and corporatize 
DABM also are underway, including 
inventorying of DABMs assets; training 
to selected DABM staff in procurement, 
billing and collection; and approval of 
bye-laws to authorize DABM’s 
conversion to a new commercial entity. 
 Tariff reform for DABM, including 
raising tariffs to cover 75% of costs by 
2010. 
 Establishment of an independent Energy 
Regulatory Commission with authority 
over tariffs, service quality, and other 
issues. 
 Energy needs survey. 
A major part of the IROA ‘s efforts to increase 
supply of electric power needs to be 
development of an effective policy to attract 
private investment to the sector, Here, lessons 
learned from other countries in the region may 
be helpful. 
A. One‐Stop Shop‐ The Private 
Public Partnership Office 
In 1987, Pakistan requested assistance from the 
World Bank to increase private sector 
participation in the electricity sector41. An 
initial framework of incentives to attract 
private investment was put in place in 1988 to 
address the following constraints: 
 Absence of a comprehensive policy 
framework concerning incentives, fiscal 
treatment, reparation of profits, 
availability of foreign exchange and 
pricing. 
 Lack of long-term financing for projects. 
 Inadequacy of institutional arrangements 
for the review, negotiation and approval 
of projects. 
In 2002 the Government adopted a Strategic 
Plan for power sector privatization, which 
included commercialization and unbundling 
and eventual privatization of the electric 
utility; establishing an independent regulator 
 
41 Lack of Access to Energy; The Enabling 
Environment Conference: Effective Private Sector 
Contribution to Development in Afghanistan; The 
Wld Bk GJ2007for the sector; and issuing tenders for private 
sector development of power projects based 
on two important elements: 
 A “one-stop shop” to address all issues 
relating to development of an IPP. 
 A ceiling bulk power tariff against which 
potential developers would bid. 
The World Bank provided assistance to the 
Power Ministry to develop procedures to 
implement this Plan, with major elements to: 
(1) develop policies to support investment; (2) 
create a vehicle for long-term financing for 
private power projects; and (3) establish a new 
entity to evaluate, negotiate and approve 
private power project investments. This new 
entity was a “one-stop shop” within the power 
utility in charge of evaluating proposals and 
negotiating agreements between the 
Government and the project developer 
necessary to bring the project to market (e.g., 
PPAs, FPAs, pricing, financing, etc.). 
This policy and institutional framework 
proved to be very successful in bring to 
market 20 IPPs with a total capacity of 4,500 
MW, with an average closing time of 2 years. 
This process can be utilized while other 
activities to commercialize and privatize the 
government-owned utility, establish an 
independent regulator and complete tariff 
reform are ongoing, thereby shortening the 
time for private sector project development. 
Major elements of this policy to ensure success 
include the following (some of these elements 
were missing from the Pakistan program, but 
are based on lessons learned from that 
process)42. 
 A clear policy and package of incentives 
to promote private investment. 
 A “one-stop shop” to address all issues 
related to approval, financing and 
development of projects. 
 Establish a bulk power tariff ceiling price 
indexed to inflation that developers bid 
against to accelerate project development, 
rather than a using a competitive bidding 
 
42 “Lessons from the Independent Power Experience in 
Pakistan;” by Julia M. Fraser; Energy and Mining 
Sector Board Discussion Paper No. 14; The World Bank 
GM2005
process (the tariff needs to be evaluated 
and altered over time in successive 
tenders to reflect market conditions). 
 Standardized security package (including 
Government and Donor guarantees) to 
reduce country and project risk. 
 A standardized and transparent review 
and approval process (with a dispute 
resolution procedure) so that the best 
(most economical) projects are selected 
and review criteria are known and fairly 
applied. 
This type of procedure could be adapted to 
Afghanistan as it is designed to address very 
similar conditions that currently exist in its 
electric power sector. In addition, this 
procedure could accelerate development of 
IPPs in Afghanistan while current efforts at 
regulatory and tariff reform and 
commercialization of DABM are ongoing. 
B. Multi‐sector Regulator &
Regulation by Contract  
Regulation by contract is a mechanism that 
specifies the roles, responsibilities and 
obligations of the electricity distribution 
company and the regulator in providing 
electric power service to retail customers43. 
This contract is similar to, but more detailed 
than a Power Purchase Agreement, which 
defines the terms and conditions for the sale of 
power from a generator to a distribution 
company. Also management contracts are a 
type of regulation by contract, in that they 
specify certain performance requirements for 
the contractor tied to rewards and penalties in 
exchange for a commitment by the 
government to provide revenue to cover costs, 
including profit. 
Recently established regulatory commissions 
in developing countries often do not have 
adequate experience or expertise in effectively 
regulating power providers and also are often 
not truly “independent” from political 
influence. In addition regulatory procedures 
and mechanisms, including dispute resolution 
procedures, generally are not well established. 
 
43 Regulation by Contract: A New Way to Privatize 
Electricity Distribution?; World Bank Working Paper 
N14Stb2003Therefore, developers may be reluctant to 
invest in distribution facilities as the 
perception of regulatory, financial and 
political risk remains too high in relation to 
expended benefits from the investment. To 
address this situation, and also to speed up the 
development process while the necessary 
conditions are being put into place to establish 
an effective regulatory commission, the 
concept of “Regulation by Contract” may be 
usefully applied. 
Regulation by contract does not specify prices. 
It pre-specifies a regulatory treatment for 
individual cost elements, which taken together 
determine the prices charged for electric 
service. The contract is a detailed tariff-setting 
agreement between the service provider and 
the regulator that forces the regulator to set 
tariffs based on a set of specific formulas and 
procedures. In this way it limits the discretion 
of the regulator and reduces the risks 
associated with investing in a power 
distribution company. In exchange, it 
establishes certain service and performance 
obligations on the distribution company to 
ensure that customers receive adequate 
service. The key component of the regulatory 
contract is a performance-based, multi-year 
tariff setting system. This type of mechanism 
has been used for a number of years with 
success in a number of developing and 
developed countries, including the US, UK, 
France, India, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia, 
and Bolivia. 
The agreement or contract contains a formula 
with pre-specified parameters that determine 
how annual total revenue or average tariffs 
levels will be established by the regulator. The 
formulas generally distinguish between 
controllable and non-controllable costs. 
Controllable costs are tied to external indexes 
or benchmarks with performance targets and 
associated rewards or penalties. Noncontrollable costs are allowed to be passed 
through to customers on a regular basis. There 
also is usually a mechanism to deal with 
unforeseen events, such as natural disaster 
that might affect the company’s costs or 
revenues and a dispute resolution mechanism 
to address disagreements between the 
company and the regulator. 
The purpose of this regulatory contract is 
to reduce the risks associated with 
investment in distribution assets so as to 
promote private investment while also 
ensuring adequate protection of 
customers by supporting adequate, safe, 
efficient, and economically priced service. 
Elements of a regulatory or performancebased contract typically include: 
 Pass through of power purchase costs 
 Recovery of distribution costs 
 Loss reduction and other quality of 
service requirements for the distribution 
company 
 Obligation to provide service by the 
distribution company 
 Performance requirements on behalf of 
the distribution company, such as 
minimum efficiency standard, number of 
new hook-ups, revenue collection targets, 
etc. 
 Distribute resolution mechanism 
 Mechanisms to reduce foreign exchange 
risk 
PROJECTS 
To ensure that ongoing activities to expand 
electricity supply mesh effectively with the 
IROA‘s longer-term objectives for the 
electricity sector and produce cost-effective 
results, it is recommended that the following 
activities be undertaken as part of an overall 
Afghanistan Energy Sector Strategy: 
1. DABM Commercialization and Capacity 
Building. It is critical that DABM be 
placed on a sound financial basis. Some 
progress has been made to commercialize 
DABM and improve its operational 
management and efficiency, these efforts 
need to be completed. Emphasis on 
improving, metering, billing and 
collections is needed; consideration also 
should be given to implementing a 
management contract to the private sector 
for these functions. 
Support for full-scale COMMERCIAL 
AUDIT Audit to be performed by one of the 
three major international audit firms 
doing business in Kabul. 
 Capacity building within the power 
utility to deal with outside auditors and 
respond to AUDITOR’S COMMENTS. 
 Pre-audit training, or audit preparations, 
to help DABM become ready to be 
audited. This would be a major piece of 
work, given the general condition of 
financial reporting in DABM over the 
past (say) 30 years, because of the war, 
etc. 
Capacity building for Accounting Systems 
and Software Implementation 
 DABM will begin Implementing 
Microsoft “Great Plains” Accounting 
Software. Comprehensive integrated 
package. 
 Significant training will be required to: 
o Modernize and standardize all 
accounting procedures at all 
provincial offices, reporting to 
central finance department; 
o Systematize preparation of all 
financial reports and statements and 
develop meaningful financial 
management reports and annual 
report that allow decision makers to 
prioritize activities and focus 
producing optimal value for money 
at each decision point 
o Design and implement budget 
planning and control systems 
o Systemize cost accounting and 
resource management to optimize 
decisions involving outsourcing, 
management contracting, etc. 
o Provide required financial data 
inputs for tariff models and 
projection of subsidy requirements. 
 Capacity Building for 
design/implementation of 
sophisticated internal Audit Systems 
 Computer training in Basic 
Operations, Programming, Database 
Management, Networking, and if 
possible MS Great Plains (needed 
immediately) 
Social Safety Net44: -- Design & Training

 Retirement Incentives for redundant 
personnel to leave 
 Vocational training plans for up to 
3000 DABM employees to enter the 
labor force 
 Labor-intensive activities and 
performance standards that may 
make it economically feasible to 
retrain and retain workers 
productively. 
Capacity Building-and Training for 
Commercial Procurement & Inventory 
Control Systems 
 Design/implement/manage 
transparent and efficient 
procurement policy, systems, and 
procedures, with internal audit 
procedures and pre award 
certification by external auditor 
 Inventory, warehouse and minimum 
stock controls training 
 Standardization of equipment, parts, 
and materials training 
 Requisition, standardized 
specifications, purchase order 
systems, receiving reports and 
professional inspection at product 
delivery to insure compliance with 
specifications, quantity verification, 
transfer to job site or warehouse, etc. 
 Training in preparing and 
maintaining specifications sheets 
 
44 DABM has approximately 5,800 employees; the news 
DABS will probably have something like 2,000 to 
perhaps 2,500 employees. The residual staff will remain 
with DABM for some time, and/or remain on the 
Ministry’s complement. These people need a Social 
Safety Net package, to allow them to retire, (if they are 
old enough) or be retrained with other marketable skills if 
they are of a suitable age. It is imperative to address this 
now so that it does not become an obstacle to full 
commercialized business practices and provides a model

 Training and technical assistance to help 
the power utility determine whether to 
develop and implement in-house 
equipment maintenance management 
systems with standard EMMS software 
or outsource equipment maintenance 
management through a management 
contract 
 Capacity building for operation of the 
system - or - for contract development, 
management, and evaluation if 
outsourcing is the preferred option.

efficiency projects increase service levels without adding 
generation costs and can be financed through utility 
bills. Obsolete wiring must be replaced or houses will 
burn when new capacity is online in late 2008 and 
customers add appliances that their houses were not 
wired to sustain. The electric utility can initiate these 
businesses with some quality control, employing some 
excess DABM staff. Later these business units can be 
spun off at full commercial value. department, business unit, cost/profit

 Metering/billing/collection/audit 
policies, etc. 
 Collection strategies 
 Baseline verification, best practices, 
outsourcing only when value-for-money 
is clearly demonstrable 
o Tariff Reform. There is an immediate 
need for tariff reform and improved 
financial viability of DABM while 
regulatory reform and other 
initiatives are ongoing. In 2004/05 
the average tariff collected by DABM 
was 5 cents/kWh compared with an 
average unit cost of 12 cents/kWh. 
The average annual cost of this 
subsidy to the government is an 
unsustainable $56 million. The goal 
of the IROA is to increase tariffs to 
cover 75% of costs by 2010. 
Completion of tariff reform is 
urgently needed. 
o Power Imports. The PPAs for power 
imports from the CAR region need to 
be completed and signed in order to 
reduce the uncertainty of increasing 
the supply of power to Kabul and 
other demand centers and support 
construction of cross-border 
transmission facilities. 
o Regulatory Reform. Currently, there 
is only an embryonic legal and 
regulatory framework for the 
Afghanistan energy sector, which is 
insufficient to support restructuring 
and private investment. None of the 
energy laws address the need for an 
independent regulatory regime to 
separate IROA policy functions from 
sector oversight and to remove 
political considerations from day-today operations of the sector. As part of the multisector regulator, bring 
electricity regulation under this body. 
Afghanistan’s energy sector is small and 
technical capacity limited. Therefore, the 
IROA should consider establishing one 
regulatory commission with authority over the 
electricity, natural gas and water sectors. The 
National Utility Regulatory Commission 
(NURC) would have responsibility over tariff 
setting; selection of facility sites; service 
standards and quality; technical, health and 
safety issues; dispute resolution; data 
collection and enforcement authority; grid 
codes; power and fuel purchasing agreements; 
and production sharing agreements. 
 Private Sector Investment. To 
encourage development of PPPs 
including IPPs, the IROA should 
develop a policy to issue tenders to 
the private sector based on a ceiling 
bulk power tariff against which 
potential developers would bid and 
incorporating a clear package of 
incentives and a “one-stop shop” that 
would address all issues relating to 
development and financing of PPP 
proposals. The IROA also should 
implement “regulation by contract,” 
including management performance 
contracts to encourage private 
investment in various segments of 
the energy sector. 
Private sector involvement in Afghanistan’s 
energy sector could include: 
 Place metering and billing for DABM 
under a commercial management 
contract with performance incentives 
and inclusion of a training program for 
DABM staff. 
 Distribution area management contracts 
 Legitimizing existing informal small 
local level electricity providers 
 Development of IPP facilities, both onand off-grid. 
 In conjunction with ongoing 
infrastructure projects, such as NEPS, 
NW Kabul, and Kabul 100MW additions; 
provide for commercial management 
contracts with performance incentives 
and inclusion of capacity development 
for DAMB staff. 
 EPC (Turnkey) contract and O&M for the 
gas-fired plant in Sheberghan. 
 Small-scale manufacturing of turbines, 
solar installations, networks. 
 Suppliers to the on-going reconstruction 
effort. 
 Owners/operators of stand-alone power 
grids and gas distribution systems. 
PETROLEUM SECTOR 
The indigenous fossil fuels in Afghanistan are 
coal, oil and natural gas. Currently petroleum 
products such as diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel 
are imported, mainly from Pakistan and 
Uzbekistan, with limited volumes from 
Turkmenistan and Iran serving regional 
markets. Turkmenistan also has a petroleum 
product storage and distribution facility at 
Tagtabazar near the Afghan border, which 
supplies northwestern Afghanistan. The 
Government has given high priority in policy 
to development of oil and gas infrastructure as 
a potentially significant source of energy for 
the country and revenue to the GOA. It also 
plans to address import issues, including 
increasing private sector participation and 
improving quality standards and collection of 
import duties. But plans have not been 
substantially put into action! 
NATURAL GAS 
Commercially, the most important energy 
resource in Afghanistan economically includes 
natural gas following water power and coal. . 
The natural gas reserves need to be evaluated 
and estimates of proven and recoverable 
resources confirmed and fields developed; 
many existing gas fields and wells need to be 
rehabilitated and infrastructure rebuilt and 
expanded. Currently ministry of mines 
attempts to develop petroleum/gas sector in 
accordance with law of hydrocarbons and 
related rules/regulations in the country 
through the full participation of private sector 
so that Afghanistan get access instantly to 
energy of natural gas and oil that are seriously 
required for rehabilitation and growth of 
economics in the country. The volume of investment and incomes depend on gradual 
development of gas/oil sector. 
The enforcement and improvement of 
domestic energy resources in the country is 
directly linked with development of the 
natural gas reserves that helps implement 
economic growth and reduce negative 
impacts. There exists sufficient amount of gas 
reserves in Sheberghan that not only tackles 
power production but also ensure the needs of 
local demands of people and factories as well. 
Also it is envisaged that the existing gas wells 
be rehabilitated , gas production be expanded 
and the pipelines networks to be extended / 
updated toward fertilizers production plants 
and other consumers. 
Development of Afghanistan’s natural gas 
resources has the potential of improving 
domestic energy resources, reducing 
environmental impacts and supporting 
economic growth. Natural gas reserves are 
potentially large enough to support 
development of electricity generation as well 
as a fertilizer plant and local commercial and 
residential markets in the Sheberghan area. 
Plans are underway to rehabilitate the gas 
fields to expand production and to upgrade 
the existing gas pipeline network to supply the 
fertilizer plant and the local market. Activities 
to promote exploration and development of 
additional gas resources have been underway 
for some time. 
Data on gas reserves indicate that there is 
sufficient low-cost gas reserves available to 
operate a 100 MW combined cycle turbine 
plant at Sheberghan for 25 years and that the 
cost per kWh of power generated would be in 
the 2.8 to 3.5 cent range. Also, gas fired 
generating capacity would be much less 
expensive than diesel power at about 30 
cents/kWh. 
Ministry of Mines has drafted and proposed a 
series of new modifications in the 
hydrocarbons law with the purpose to better 
accelerate the gas sector development process. 
The Afghan-Tajik and Amu river zones were 
blocked , and work has been running in 
provision of tender documents for attraction 
of private sector investment and it is due that 
in 2008 MoM would lease two gas fields and 
one oil filed through biddings to private 
sector
A. Reserve Estimates
Based on the existing reports, 120 cubic meters 
of gas reserves and approximately 14,5 million 
tons of petroleum reserves have been 
identified. However in accordance with recent 
evaluations, the size of gas/coals reported to 
have been more than the above estimation. As 
based on the US geological survey , 444 billion 
cubic natural gas reserves, 219 million tons oil 
and 75 million tons kandansat have been 
identified in latest investigations. 
In addition to proven reserves, there exist 
numerous un-drilled prospective structures 
that have undergone various stages of 
exploration. If even a small number of these 
un-drilled structures contained commercial 
hydrocarbon accumulations, the estimated 
undiscovered gas resources in northern 
Afghanistan could dramatically exceed 
current resource estimates.47 
Based on studies and assessments conducted 
to date, there is a consensus among most 
international experts that some important 
issues require further review: 
 The manner in which these undiscovered 
reserves are categorized. 
 It is possible that some of these structures 
may have no hydrocarbons or only 
marginal accumulations. Only by drilling 
and testing the wells can this information 
be confirmed. 
 It is likely that many of these reserves 
will be categorized as higher risk. 
B. Production and
Infrastructure
Production of gas is estimated at about 21.2 
million cubic feet/day. This figure comparing 
with gas price in the region would exceed to 
50 million US dollar in a year.Unless new 
wells drilling and new production is not 
commenced , the exact expenditure related to 
gas price seems very difficult. This is a 
problem that encounters private investment 
with difficulty aimed at developing gas sector. 
Mazar-Sheberghan pipelines that were not 
 
47 Evaluation of Investment Options for the development 
of Oil and Gas Infrastructure; Hill International, 2004-
2005extended technically seem to have been 
disconnected since the last three years due to 
lacking natural gas and it will also not be 
applied in future. 
Afghan Gas 
In addition, current gas prices are too low to 
cover costs of rehabilitation, O&M and 
expansion of production and infrastructure. 
Since currently the gasification system is full 
of technical defects, it causes problems in 
collecting the exact revenues. The tariffs 
should be arranged in a way to cover the real 
cost and implement the interest-based 
sustainable activities. As now the extraction, 
delivery, distribution and sale of natural gas 
has been running by Afghan gas enterprise 
and the relevant payment of gas price is also 
collected by the above enterprise and 
transferred to government account. 
The majority of more than 12,000 residential 
customers and more than 700 business 
customers are not metered. Afghan Gas 
management indicates that metered and nonmetered customers generally pay the same 
rate for gas. No meaningful data is available to 
adequately present the costs of operating and 
maintaining the system at this time.48
Moreover, the technical standard of Afghan 
gas operations is extremely low. There is no 
incentive to conserve or to optimize use of gas 
resources as the present cost is so low and 
operations are so inefficient. 
Afghan Gas reports that its customers are $15 
million in arrears for the past 10-15 years. 
According to Asian Development Bank (ADB) 
funded data49, non-payment is high. 
According to Afghan Gas if a customer fails to 
pay for gas use on time, they are cut off. 
However, there is a common occurrence of 
carrying the customer debt to the next billing 
period and not cutting them off so long as 
some payment is made. In the lapse of few 
years, illegal connection has been reduced 
considerably , legal connections and expansion 
of gas delivery network is not available due to

gas .. 
C. Natural Gas Development
Program  
The natural gas development program 
supported by the IROA is intended to increase 
production and develop the transmission and 
distribution infrastructure so that a higher 
proportion of the Afghanistan’s energy 
requirements can be met by natural gas and 
dependence on imported oil can be reduced. 
Key issues relating to the natural gas sector are 
that are receiving IROA attention include: 
 Strengthening the capacity of key 
institutions to rehabilitate and develop its 
related capacities, to better arrange 
agreement affairs and investments related 
to extraction, exploration and 
exploitation of natural gas 
 Reviewing policy, institutional, 
regulatory and environmental issues 
based on an efficient policy and 
regulatory framework. 
 Developing a policy framework to 
support private investment in gas 
exploration and exploitation. 
 Increasing Government revenues by 
phasing out gradual price subsidies and 
improving revenue collection. 
 Establishment of codes, standards and 
mechanisms for growth of the sector. 
The operational strategy of the Government 
for the gas sector is to promote economic 
growth by removing impediments to the 
reconstruction and modernization program 
and to open the sector to private investment, 
particularly for gas exploration and 
development. 
Efforts to attract private investment depend on 
developing policy reforms and structural 
changes to support longer-term sector 
development and expansion. Progress to date 
has been slow, thereby limiting investor 
interest. Options to speed up this process and 
to increase private sector involvement need to 
be explored. D. Measures to Support Gas 
Exploration/development 
The following measures are being undertaken 
to support natural gas exploration and 
development: 
 Complete a detailed study of the gas 
fields to determine their potential size 
and development potential. 
 Modify the hydrocarbons law to clearly 
define roles and responsibilities of the 
government and developers with regard 
to exploration and development of gas 
reserves. (Underway through assistance 
from Norway.) 
 Draft a gas sector law to address downstream (delivery, pricing and sale) issues. 
 Bring regulatory oversight operations 
under NURC. 
 Capacity building and training for MoM 
and Afghan Gas. 
Efforts need to be undertaken to coordinate 
ongoing assistance efforts to improve their 
effectiveness; develop a focused policy for 
development of the sector, including attracting 
private investment; and to establish pricing, 
tax and royalty regimes that promote 
sustainable development and provide a steady 
source of revenue to the Government. 
Activities that need to be taken as part of the 
Energy Sector Strategy include: 
1. Development of Sheberghan Gas 
Fields and Power Plant. Afghanistan needs to 
develop indigenous energy resources, 
including natural gas reserves in the 
Sheberghan area. Data on gas reserves indicate 
that there is sufficient low-cost gas reserves 
available to operate a combined cycle turbine 
plant at Sheberghan for 25 years and that the 
cost per kWh of power generated would be in 
the 2.8 to 3.5 cent range. While this is more 
expensive than the cost of imported power, 
which currently is in the 2.0 to 2.5 cents/kWh 
range, future prices are already moving closer 
to 4.0 cents/kWh or more. Also, it is important 
to note the domestic benefits resulting from 
developing the gas fields and gas-fired power 
plant. 
Based on World Bank and USTDA 
assessments of the Sheberghan gas fields, 
USAID is considering construction of a 
100MW gas-fired power plant to be located 
near the Khwoja Gegertak, Jarkaduk and 
Yatimtaq gas fields. USAID is confirming the 
size of the reserves, quality of the gas and 
delivery prospects for the plant and plans to 
move forward with construction of the 
generating plant pending results of these 
assessments. 
A high priority for the Energy Sector Strategy 
is to complete assessment of the Sheberghan 
natural gas fields, issue a production sharing 
agreement for development of the fields, 
complete the rehabilitation of the gas pipeline 
and develop the 100 MW Sheberghan gas-fired 
power plant to feed into the NEPS grid. These 
activities should include reviewing options for 
private sector participation in development of 
the power plant, such as a management 
contract and bundling the project with 
rehabilitation and expansion of the gas 
processing and fertilizer plants. Moreover, the 
IROA needs to consider options to attract 
private sector participation and investment in 
the gas sector, including management 
contracts for Afghan Gas, to rehabilitate and 
operate the gas processing facility and to 
expand and operate the fertilizer plant. 
1. Complete Tariff Reform to raise 
natural gas prices to cover costs and improve 
metering, billing and collections. 
2. Come under NURC for effective 
oversight of the sector as outlined above in the 
Electricity Sector section. NURC would have 
authority over licensing, sitting, tariff, and 
other rate making and oversight authority. 
While this authority is being established 
options to promote development of these 
sectors, including attraction of private sector 
investment should be employed, such as a PPP 
Office to promote development and issuance 
of management contracts and other PPP 
instruments. 
3. Revamp the Hydrocarbons Law to 
reflect a modern oil and gas sector and 
incorporate international best practices; clearly 
define the roles and responsibilities of the 
government and developers with regard to 
exploration and development of gas oil 
reserves and to address environment, health and safety issues; and set a timetable for 
designated turning sector areas over to the 
private sector. This is being done through 
assistance from Norway and the consultants 
need to work closely with others to 
incorporate PPP provisions in the law. 
4. Reserve Estimation and Exploration
is important to determine the location, size, 
and economics of recoverable reserves. This 
has to be coupled with reform so that the 
private sector will begin to undertake the 
exploration and development natural gas. 
5. Conduct a CNG feasibility study. 
CNG holds significant promise both 
economically and environmentally in most 
countries in South Asia have already 
embarked on CNG vehicle programs. Clearly, 
the viability of a CNG program is linked to the 
availability of natural gas and items 1 and 5 
above will provide the basis for the feasibility 
study. 
5. Afghan Gas Reform. The Afghan Gas is 
faced with a couple of problems due to the 
following factors: inadequacy of tariffs to 
finance costs, non-existence of appropriate 
equippment required, methods and update 
procedures, lacking sufficient funding, low 
working capacities and unawareness about 
technology reasons including tariffs that don’t 
cover costs, a lack of functioning equipment, 
modern methods and procedures, funds and 
trained personnel, customers that aren’t 
metered and don’t pay and an infrastructure 
that is crippled. Performance at Afghan Gas 
can be improved. In addition to the capacity 
building measures already underway, the 
company should be unbundled and 
functionally separated into upstream (resource 
development) and downstream (gas 
transmission and distribution) entities with an 
eventual eye towards some form of private 
sector involvement. At the earliest, this could 
take the form a management performance 
contract, including performance incentives 
and training requirements for MoM and 
Afghan Gas staff. The economics do not 
support metering but there are creative ways 
of effectively recovering for service and these 
need to be explored by the NURC. 
CRUDE OIL AND 
PETROLEUM PRODUCTS 
Afghanistan has only limited supplies of oil. 
Currently oil mines extraction is not fulfilled. 
The extractive oil wells of Rangot has been 
under conservation since the last two 
years.extrative oil.50 As a result, Afghanistan 
depends on imports for most of its 
consumption. Oil is produced in limited 
quantities primarily from the Angot oil field, 
located in Sar-i-Pol province. Given the 
serious supply shortfall, in order to meet 
country’s needs, most petroleum products—
diesel, gasoline and jet fuel included—are 
imported primarily from Pakistan and 
Uzbekistan. 
Infrastructure for local production of oil is 
largely non-existent and what infrastructure is 
present is functioning inefficiently and suffers 
from low capacities.. In addition, the level of 
local expertise in oil exploration and 
development is limited. As a result, sector 
entities have been unable to operate 
effectively, to repair and maintain the system, 
nor engage effectively in new exploration and 
development. A large part of the 
infrastructure for storage, transmission and 
distribution of petroleum products has been 
damaged, while the remaining capacity is in 
need of rehabilitation. 
All known petroleum reserves of Afghanistan 
exist in Amu Darya Basin while there are 
implications signaling that petroleum also 
exists in Afghan-Tajik basin (north -east) of the 
country and its existence has been forecasted. 
Based on the USGS estimation, oil reserves in 
north of the country reaches to 219 ml tons. 
Ministry of mines envisages to lease one oil 
block in the course of 2008, the oil extraction, 
exploration, production and filtratioan affairs 
will be made by private sector. 
The IROA also has a proposal to install a 
crude oil refinery in the country. 
A.   Petroleum Products
 
50 Securing Afghanistan’s Future: Accomplishments and 
the Strategic Path Forward; OIL AND GAS Technical 
AJ2004All petroleum products consumed in 
Afghanistan are imported from the 
neighbouring countries of Pakistan, Iran, 
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan51. 
The gasoline produced by refineries in these 
countries does not conform to the 
international standard for lead content (0.13 g 
/ l of lead content) to achieve the 91 RON 
(octane) that modern car engines require. 
Currently, Angot area isnot extracted and all 
local refineries have been destroyed and left 
inactive. . 
Afghanistan consumes approximately 
1,200,000 tons of state-supplied fuel per year52. 
This includes all types of petrol and diesel (i.e., 
JP1, JP4, TC1 – generation, heating, aviation) 
as well as mazut and kerosene. It is e 
estimated that about 80% of these fuels are 
consumed for automotive purposes, while 
20% is used for power auto-production 
(gasoline mainly) or small-scale grid power 
generation (diesel mainly), and water pumps. 
At present, eight border transfer points exist to 
facilitate the import of liquid fuels into 
Afghanistan. Prices to its stations are set by 
the state monopoly, Petroleum and Gas 
Enterprise (Liquid Fuels) operating under the 
auspices of the Ministry of Commerce and 
Industries. Operations include 1600 gas 
stations and 1300 fuel trucks that are closely 
controlled and impact virtually every province 
in the country. Infrastructure as well as 
operational improvements could provide an 
opportunity for private investment and more 
transparent operations. Demand for liquid 
fuels in Afghanistan has increased 
dramatically in the past five years; with 
continued and increased reliance on diesel 
generation, air traffic and home uses, this 
demand is expected to increase. 
There has been no donor support to this 
sector. Instead, more than 30 reported private 
contractors work with the Petroleum and Gas 
Enterprise to supply Afghanistan’s gas 
stations with fuel as well as to import diesel 
fuel for power generation.

Plan; ADB TA 4088; Sofregaz, June 2004.

itt td tthtt
The low quality of automotive fuel imports 
imposes serious health impacts on the urban 
population as well as financial costs in terms 
of engine maintenance and higher fuel 
consumption. The IROA needs to put into 
place a system for certification of petroleum 
traders and to randomly test products at retail 
outlets and storage depots to enforce quality 
standards. It also should look at increasing 
storage facilities and review the import duty 
and collection process to ensure maximum 
revenue to the Government. 
Ministry of mines endeavors to lease one oil 
area through international biddings to private 
sector for oil exploration, extraction, 
production and refining. 
B. Measure to Support Oil 
Exploration 
The operational strategy of the Government 
for the hydrocarbon sector is to promote 
economic growth by removing impediments 
to the modernization and reconstruction 
program. In particular policy, financial, 
regulatory and institutional constraints need 
to be addressed. The Government plans to 
open up the oil sector to private participation, 
specifically for exploration,extraction, 
production , petroleum imports and 
marketing. It is recognized that there is a need 
to establish separate policy and regulatory 
functions, to undertake sector restructuring, 
and to improve operation, maintenance and 
safety standards. It will take time to put these 
reforms in place; therefore, a parallel approach 
is being pursued by using existing 
Government structures to implement 
reconstruction and capacity building 
programs while exploring options and 
developing a consensus on policy reforms and 
structural and institutional changes. However, 
this strategy suffers from a lack of technical 
expertise and poor coordination among IROA 
entities. 
Given the current security, institutional, policy 
and infrastructure situation, it may be difficult 
to attract interest by the private sector to 
invest in the Afghanistan oil sector. If 
significant interest is not displayed, other 
options such as management contracts for 
development of oil fields could be pursued. In order to pursue its objectives for the oil 
sector, the IROA is addressing a number of 
initiatives relating to strengthening the sector 
and establishing a basis for future expansion 
and private sector investment. Key issues 
relating to the oil sector that are being 
addressed include: 
 Strengthening the capacity of key 
institutions to support sector 
rehabilitation and reconstruction. 
 Undertaking a review of policy, 
institutional, regulatory and 
environmental issues. 
 Establishing an efficient policy and 
regulatory framework, including support 
for private investment in oil exploration, 
production, import and marketing. 
 Increasing Government revenues by 
gradually phasing out government 
subsidies and improving revenue 
collection. 
 Implementing regulatory reform to 
separate policy, regulatory and 
operational functions. 
 Creating institutional capacity for 
negotiating agreements and monitoring 
investments in exploration and extraction 
of oil. 
 Establishing appropriate codes and 
standards and developing enforcement 
mechanisms for the sector. 
Recommendations: 
The IROA has made broad policy 
commitments and engaged in technical 
assistance and capacity building efforts 
supported by donor funding to restructure 
and develop the oil sector. However, these 
activities have not been incorporated into a 
comprehensive strategic plan for the energy 
sector. As part of the Energy Sector Strategy, 
the IROA and donors need to undertake the 
following activities with regard to the oil 
sector: 
 1. Review Options for Attracting 
Private Sector Participation and investment, 
including management contracts for research 
and development of oil reserves; development 
of a small oil refinery and distribution of crude 
oil products; and development and 
ilttif thfit il dti
sharing agreement. It could also take the form 
of privatizing service stations. 
2. Modify the Hydrocarbons Law 
of 2005 to clarify ownership and development 
of resources; to provide for exploration and 
development by the private sector, including 
stetting production sharing agreements, 
establish fiscal, tax, health and safety policies 
and standards; and establish an independent 
regulatory authority. 
. 
3. Petroleum Imports. The IROA 
needs to improve control of imports and 
collection of duties; test products at retail 
outlets and storage depots to improve quality; 
and should consider increasing domestic 
storage facilities.. 
The government should improve and control 
revenues collection, monitor quality of oil 
materials in the areas of importation, storage 
and market and finally to pay attention to 
supplying oil through domestic 
establishments. 
B. Coal
Afghanistan has reasonably good quality coal 
resources that exceeds almost 2 ml tons and is 
estimated to have significant coal reserves 
(probable reserves estimated at about 400 
million tons), most of which are located in the 
northern part of the country in the region 
between Herat and Badakhshan53. Although 
Afghanistan produced over 100,000 short tons 
of coal annually as late as the early 1990s, , its 
production currently reaches to 300.000- 
400.000 tons annually 
The primary coal resources in Afghanistan 
occur in the Katawaz Basin south and west of 
Kabul. Prospective economically viable coal 
deposits are found in five coal districts: Karkar 
dodkash, Ishpushta, Dara-i-Suf, chal wa 
namakab and sabzake Herat. However, the 
real extent of coal deposits in the country is 
not known and there is an urgent need for 
exploration and exrtraction. 
 
53 Securing Afghanistan’s Future: Accomplishments 
and the Strategic Path Forward; Mining Sector, 
Thil AJ2004Some current coal operations are taking place 
at Karkar and Ispushta mining districts. The 
literature indicates that Dara-i-Suf appears to 
have the greatest potential for significant 
reserves, already estimated to be over 84 
million tons. This coal is believed to be of 
coking grade with a high calorific value in the 
range of 7,000 kilo-calories/kg. The mines at 
Kalich in the Ispushta district are active. Coal 
in these districts is extracted by either crude, 
inefficient, mechanized mining methods or by 
“artesian” methods. Current production from 
all operations is estimated to be about 110,000 
short tons. 
The existing industrial sized coal mines are 
marginal (if not out of operation) due to 
antiquated machinery and lack of maintenance 
and new investment. However, there is 
considerable small scale production. At 
present, the small scale mining sector, 
including coal is wholly unregulated and 
occupies large numbers of persons in difficult 
security, health, and environmental 
conditions. Moreover, coal demand and prices 
in urban centers have risen due to domestic 
energy needs during the winter months and 
also due to increasing industrial demand to 
fire construction bricks. 
Development of coal and other mineral 
resources requires investments in excess of 
private sector.. Therefore the IROA‘s economic 
policy is to establish an enabling environment 
conducive to attracting and retaining 
investment by private sector both local and 
international groups. However, privatization 
and/or leasing of existing state owned mining 
enterprises to private groups is, at present, 
held up by the lack of adequate mining 
legislation and the need for a clear policy on 
sector development. Enabling legislation and a 
proper mineral concession system is needed to 
establish clear lines of authority and 
responsibility for the Government and for 
private developers in the area of investments. 
If appropriate measures are taken to 
distinguish regulatory from operational 
functions within the ministry departments 
responsible for coal; put existing operations on 
a commercial basis so that they may attract 
private investment; and establish market 
prices for coal, it is estimated that the value of 
annual coal production could increase from 
the current US$ 10 million to US$ 40 million
To develop the coal sector and increase 
production to support new electricity 
generation, the Government needs to adopt 
appropriate policies and programs to 
stimulate private sector investment, rather 
than direct government investment in 
operations. To achieve these objectives 
internationally competitive mining legislation 
and fiscal measures are necessary. 
There is good potential for the mining sector—
including coal—to be an important source of 
growth for the Afghanistan economy. In 
assessing that potential, the IROA needs to 
assess existing constraints on development of 
the sector in terms of enabling policy; 
regulatory and taxation regimes for private 
investment; institutional capacities; 
infrastructure, safety and other constraints. 
Upon addressing these constraints, a 
reasonable sector development scenario needs 
to be developed, including estimates of 
benefits (production value, taxes, jobs, value 
added). 
Comprehensive data on the scale and 
economic recoverability of coal and other 
mineral resources is largely unavailable and a 
strategy to exploit these resources in an 
economic and sustainable basis needs to be 
developed. The MoM places recoverable coal 
reserves in Afghanistan at over 1 billion metric 
tons. Other estimates are quite a bit lower at 
about 400 million tons.54 Recent estimates 
place recoverable coal reserves for 
Afghanistan at about 200 million tons. 
Allowing for coal handling losses and 
preparation processing further losses of about 
20% can be expected, bringing the recoverable 
resource to about 165 million tons. 
If conducted in an environmentally 
sustainable manner, exploitation of coal 
resources can provide substantial tax revenues 
to central and local governments, create direct 
and indirect jobs, and stimulate spin-off 
industries in and around the mining 
operations. While Afghanistan has excellent 
geological potential the mining sector is 
significantly under developed. Three 
 
54 Energy Sector Overview and Gas Sector Master Plan: 
Final Report; TA-4088AFG; Sofregaz, June 28, 2004; 
and US Energy Information Administration; 
WhitDCdifficulties currently hinder development of 
the sector: 
 Mining rules and regulations and 
taxation arrangements do not reflect 
modern practices and are not 
conducive to new private sector 
investment. Additionally, the capacity 
and technical know-how of 
government institutions responsible 
for the sector are not up to modern 
standards. 
 The security situation in the country 
has limited the ability of the central 
government to establish national 
sovereignty over mineral resources 
and to promote exploration and 
development. 
 Development of coal and other 
mineral resources requires 
investments in excess of government 
abilities. The IROA needs to establish 
an enabling environment conducive 
to attracting and retaining investment 
by both local and international 
entities. 
Afghanistan’s coal reserves are undersurveyed. Current production is about 
300.000-400.000 tons annually, of which about 
250.,000 short tons comes from governmentcontrolled mines. The supply is far less than 
the demand. Coal has the potential to displace 
fuel wood and charcoal used in the vast 
majority of rural households. The MoM 
estimates annual demand at about 500,000-
600.000 short tons used primarily for kilns in 
the construction of bricks, cement and 
commercial and industrial uses, including 
power generation. 
Estimates of the cost of coal produced 
from new underground mines in 
Afghanistan at about $28.5 USD/short 
ton, not including taxes and royalties, 
which typically average about 10%. The 
cost of coal from a surface mine is 
estimated at about $18/ short ton, 
excluding taxes and royalties. 
Measures to Increase Coal Production 
To increase coal production for power 
generation and other uses, and to attract 
private investment to the sector, the following 
initiatives are receiving IROA attention, 
although a coordinated and comprehensive 
program is needed: 
 Explaining the country’s coal fields to 
attract investors of minerals law aimed at 
lightening their minds in Afghanistan. 
 Explaining minerals law for lightening 
the minds of investors 
 Establishing a clear base for State 
institutions to attract 
national/international investors for 
investing on coal mines as per the laws 
enforced in the country 
 Create a modern and internationally 
competitive legal and regulatory 
framework emphasizing the primary role 
of the private sector, the regulatory role 
of the Government, and taking into 
account the special condition of small 
scale producers. This includes. 
o Clarifying state ownership of mineral 
resources in their natural state. 
o Clarifying the legal basis for private 
access to mineral rights. 
o Establishing a clear mandate for 
government institutions to grant 
private access to mineral rights. 
o Establishment of a Mining Cadastre. 
o Clear identification of the form and 
nature of mineral rights available to 
the private sector. 
o Transparent and uniform fiscal and 
taxation package. 
o Security of tenure for license holder. 
o Transferability of title. 
o Appropriate environment, health and 
safety requirements. 
 Institutional strengthening for Ministry of 
Mines. 
 Establishment of an internationally 
competitive taxation regime. 
 Reinforcement of the geological and geoscience database. Improvement in small, medium and large 
scale mining. 
 Establishment of environmental and 
social management capacity. 
C. Coal Sector Policy 
Afghanistan’s coal sector requires immediate 
capital investment to support development of 
resources as well as for development of power 
plants that utilize coal for fuel. The current 
process by the MoM to complete resource 
assessments and invite private participation in 
the sector to be enforced and improved.. This 
process relies in the MoM to evaluate 
development potential, decide which 
resources and projects to develop and then 
issue a tender for potential developers to 
respond to. The MoM is simply capable of 
strengthening the growth of private sector 
development based on the market economic 
policy and according to mineral rule and 
regulations. As a result, development of 
projects that could contribute to economic 
growth and employment, provide an 
important source of revenue to the 
Government, and provide a fuel source to 
support expanded power generation are 
unnecessarily delayed. 
A solution to this dilemma would be for the 
MoM to issue tenders to which the private 
sector would respond and propose projects for 
development of coal resources and associated 
power plants based on the private sector’s 
analysis of the potential value of the project. 
The MoM—through a panel of experts 
convened with donor assistance—would 
evaluate the proposals and award contracts to 
those projects with the greatest economic 
potential, including revenue source to the 
Government. This mechanism places the 
impetus for developing domestic energy 
resources on the private sector rather than on 
the MoM, thereby providing a much greater 
incentive to complete these projects in a timely 
and efficient manner. 
Private sector (national and international 
companies) can invest with respect to mineral 
law and the government economic policy 
concerned with mines and other implications 
of coal mines in the country. 
This type of approach to resource 
development has proven successful in India, 
where the Government has issued three types 
of permits to the private sector to encourage 
development of mineral resources. These 
include: 
 A Reconnaissance Permit, is a license by 
which the private sectors can identify 
coal deposits and its other parameters 
aimed at exploring an area at the size of 
250 km/square in accordance with the 
mining material law . Of course, the 
exploitation areas shouldnot be more 
than 50 km/square. The above permit 
and its availability: Based on the mining 
material law and the government 
economic policy, private entrepreneurs 
(national /international companies) can 
avail the above permit toward settling the 
country’s requirements in terms of 
shortage of energy and growth and 
improvement of industries in 
Afghanistan and to expand mining in the 
area of coal based on mineral law. 
 A Prospecting License, which is a license 
for exploring, locating, and proving a 
mineral or hydrocarbon deposit. It is 
granted for a 3-year period for the area 
where development is to occur. 
 A Development License, which permits 
the project developer to undertake 
development activities to bring the 
project to completion and market its 
output. 
There are a number of advantages to this 
process: 
 It relies mainly on development of the 
private sector, prepares the ground for 
consolidation and exploration of coal in 
the country. With implementation of the 
above program, the exploration and 
exploitation of deposits as well as coal 
mines not only improve the country’s 
coal industry, but also provides a secured 
condition for absorption of investment in 
the country. This step also helps dissolve 
shortage of energy, protect environment 
and prevent the demolition of efficient 
and non-efficient forests/trees and 
provide better livelihood and 
employment opportunities for people in 
Afghanistan. 
 The tenders provide information on 
which proposals will be ranked and awarded so that all developers know the 
rules of the game and the best (most 
economically attractive) projects can be 
selected. These criteria can be altered 
with successive tender offerings to reflect 
new information and market conditions 
to ensure that new projects provide the 
greatest benefit. 
 The availability and perpetuation of 
functioning mines(exploration and 
exploitation) to be handled 
simultaneously based on the law of 
mining materials, it takes less time and 
will also encourage private sector to 
invest on coal mining. 
Recommendations: As part of Afghanistan’s 
Energy Sector Strategy, the IROA needs to 
undertake the following programs: 
 1. Providing proper condition for 
private sector development of coal resources 
and associated power plants. This would 
include issuing a Reconnaissance Permit, 
Prospecting License and Development License 
as discussed above, with specific deadlines 
and incentives to develop resources and 
associated infrastructure. 
 2. Provision and completion of 
functioning mine rules according to law orders 
of mining materials to clarify ownership and 
development roles and responsibilities of the 
IROA and the private sector in this respect. 
RURAL AND RENEWABLE 
ENERGY 
Due to the dispersed nature of the rural 
population, renewable energy offers the best 
solution for electrification for the majority of 
Afghanistan’s rural population that currently 
does not have access to electricity and has no 
real expectation of connection to the grid55. 
Most of Afghanistan’s 25 million people have 
no access to modern forms of energy. Fuel 
wood accounts for an estimated 75% of total 
rural energy supplies. This is having an 
adverse impact on forests and watersheds. In 
addition, burning these fuels increases indoor 
 
55 Government of Afghanistan; Ministry of Energy and 
Water: Policy for Renewable Energy Rural 
EltifitiDb82006
air pollution, which adversely affects the 
health of women and children in particular. 
Extreme poverty in rural areas also is related 
to lack of income earning opportunities. The 
productive use of electricity helps reduce 
poverty by providing alternative sources of 
livelihoods and increase educational and 
training opportunities. The remoteness of 
rural locations and the rough terrain make 
expansion of the electricity grid into these 
areas economically infeasible. Therefore, the 
application off-grid technology to these 
areas—including renewable energy 
resources—is the primary focus of IROA 
activities. 
The role of the IROA is to provide policy and 
regulatory frameworks to encourage and 
facilitate participation by the private sector 
and civil society in rural electrification and 
application of renewable energy technologies. 
Ultimate responsibility for renewable and 
rural electrification resides in the Ministry of 
Energy and Water (MEW), although other 
entities, particularly the MRRD and its 
program, NSP, CDCs, NGOs, and donors are 
active in rural development projects. MEW 
also is charged with establishing a renewable 
and rural energy policy in conformance with 
the development objectives of the IROA and 
ANDS. 
In addition to hydro, solar energy is 
considered the most important renewable 
energy source. Estimates indicate that in 
Afghanistan solar radiation averages about 6.5 
kWh per square meter per day and the skies 
are sunny about 300 days a year. 
Consequently, the potential for solar energy 
development is high, not only for solar water 
heaters for homes, hospitals and other 
buildings, but also for generating electricity. In 
addition, some 125 sites have been identified 
for micro-hydro resource development with 
the potential to generate 100 MW of power. 
Other renewable energy technologies, 
particularly micro-hydro and wind energy, 
have broad applicability within rural areas of 
Afghanistan. The GOA, primarily through the 
Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and 
Development in cooperation with the MEW 
has developed projects to promote micro-hydro development in rural areas. In addition, 
under the US National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory, wind mapping has been 
undertaken for many parts of Afghanistan as a 
basis for developing individual projects. The 
data indicate good potential for generating 
wind electricity in several parts of the country. 
The lead institute to support development of 
these resources in Afghanistan is the National 
Renewable Energy Research and Development 
Center, a part of MEW. 
It is proposed that a Rural Energy Institute 
(REI) be established in the MRRD to 
demonstrate the application of appropriate 
technologies to rural environments and to 
demonstrate business models for income 
generation and cost recovery. The National 
Renewable Energy Research and Development 
Center would still remain the focal point for 
development of large renewable and would 
coordinate and lend assistance as required to 
the REI. This is consistent with both the new 
delineation of roles and the mission of MRRD 
as working with and through other Ministries. 
At present, about 650 villages are supplied 
with electricity from photovolaics, through a 
program funded by the National Solidarity 
Program (NSP). Other donors (e.g., 
Government of India) and NGOs (e.g., 
Norwegian Church Aide) are active in this 
area. The private sector also is encouraged to 
participate and invest in rural electrification 
and deployment of energy efficiency and 
renewable energy technologies. Although, 
NGOs and donors provide much assistance, 
there appears to be no clear IROA policy for 
rural electrification or for promoting private 
sector participation in rural energy projects; 
also coordination among ministries and other 
project participants' needs improvement. 
Hydropower, solar, wind and biomass offer 
the most potential to contribute to energy 
supply. Development, however, requires 
sound institutional and financial support, 
sustained commitment and a long-term 
development horizon. Use of renewable 
energy is beset by a number of factors, 
including high upfront costs,56 lack of 
 
56 For example, estimate for Photovoltaic electricity, 
as per MRRD (Mostafa Torkan, May 24, 2007) is 
$12000/kWd t(i) Mihd
suppliers, inadequate financing mechanisms, 
and weak institutional and technical capacity. 
The objectives of the IROA‘s program for rural 
and renewable energy development are to 
provide a sufficient level of efficient, clean 
energy service to all rural customers. Current 
activities to promote rural and renewable 
energy projects include: 
 Development of micro-hydro and solar 
power systems in rural areas. 
 Installation of diesel generation in small 
and medium size cities where no 
alternatives to electricity access are 
available. 
 NSP is working with Community 
Development Councils (CDCs) to install 
over 500 micro-hydro projects since 2003. 
 Development of wind energy and biogas 
systems in selected rural locations. 
 Institutional reform and capacity building 
initiatives at MEW and MRRD. 
 Rehabilitation of hydro generation plants 
in Pul-i-Chemri, Khanabad, Saurobi, and 
Mahipar. 
 Feasibility studies for new hydro power 
plants in Baghdara (280MW) and Saurobi 
2 (180MW). 
 Electrify 25 Small Towns and 800 
Representative Rural Households by 2013 
(80MW). The Inter-ministerial 
Commission for Energy (ICE) is 
supporting several action items 
including57: (1) strengthening the NSP 
program; (2) initiating a rural 
electrification action-oriented agenda and 
establish an energy committee to connect 
small towns such as Khulm, Aybak, 
Doshi, Chatikar and Baghlan. 
Rural and renewable energy projects 
contribute several types of benefits that help 
improve rural well being. They contribute to 
physical capital through infrastructure 
development, financial capital through credit 
provision, human capital through training, 
 
at $1,200/kW and Diesel generated power at 
$500/kW. 
57 ICE is a coordinating body, not an 
implementing body. It is not clear that it is 
tithtiidit and social capital through enhancing the 
ability of communities to work together to 
better the lives of inhabitants. Project activities 
also focus on rural enterprise development 
and local empowerment. Alone, they do little 
to increase economic activity but combined as 
part of an integrated rural development 
package they are very effective. 
Electrifying rural areas faces daunting 
challenges, including dispersed populations; 
often difficult terrain; high initial capital and 
operating costs of power systems; poor load 
profiles; weak rural energy implementing 
entities; need for continual subsidies; poor 
private sector participation; and lack of 
standards and regulation. A comprehensive 
strategy is needed to promote an enabling 
environment that supports project 
development and also ensures participation by 
the poor in decision-making and project 
implementation. 
Development of rural and renewable energy 
resources, including rural electrification, is 
taking place in Afghanistan without a clear 
institutional or policy framework. There is a 
de facto split of responsibility for rural 
electrification among ministries and 
coordination between ministries and donorfunded programs needs improvement. The 
Government needs to articulate a policy that 
clearly defines goals and objectives; clarifies 
the role and expected scope of subsidies; and 
emphasizes the role of the private sector. A 
clear, standardized procedure for assessing 
and evaluating renewable energy resources as 
the basis for supporting development of pilot 
projects needs to be established. Various 
methods of supporting rural energy projects, 
such as community development entities, 
rural cooperatives, and franchises, need to be 
evaluated and tested as to their applicability to 
Afghanistan. 
Examples of successful rural energy projects 
that could be supported by the IROA and 
donors include the following: 
POWER DISTRIBUTION IN 
GHAZNI 
Omary Electric Company (OEC) is a private 
company operating in Ghazni for over 8 years. 
It operates 8 diesel generators with a total 
capacity of about 1 MW and distributes power 
throughout the city on its own low-voltage 
system. OEC serves more than 8,500 
customers with a staff of 42 and offers 24-hour 
service. The power tariff is based on the cost of 
diesel fuel and in July 2006 was 35 Afs/kWH. 
All customers are metered and new customers 
pay a non-refundable connection fee of 
between 1,000 and 3,000 Afs depending on the 
connection distance. OEC is essentially selfregulated, and provides a good example of 
private sector initiative that could be 
encouraged through an official “light handed 
regulation” policy. 
RURAL ELECTRIFICATION 
IN BANGLADESH58
The Bangladesh off-grid electrification fund 
supported by the World Bank Rural 
Electrification and Renewable Energy 
Development Project (RERED) provides solar 
home systems to rural households and has 
supported deployment of as many as 3,000 
household systems per month. With the 
assistance of Participating Organizations 
(POs), including municipalities, NGOs and the 
private sector, the program has resulted in the 
installation of nearly 90,000 solar home 
systems and has extended its funding to cover 
biogas and community electricity systems. 
The fund is administered by the Infrastructure 
Development Company Limited, a non-bank 
financial institution and provides both credit 
and Global Environmental Facility (GEF) 
subsidies to 14 Pos to purchase PV household 
systems from a list of venders approved by a 
Technical Standards Committee (TC). Overall, 
the Fund provides the following benefits: 
 Provides loans to POs who pass the funds 
on to customers (up to 80% of cost of a PV 
system). 
 
58 While the market characteristics of Bangladesh 
are significantly different than Afghanistan, the 
example highlights how innovative mechanisms 
bfftildProvides the GEFfinanced grant. 
 Develops customer awareness of solar 
home systems or other rural energy 
programs. 
 Provides technical assistance to POs in 
developing proposals for financing. 
 Selects POs based on their performance 
and financial track record. 
 Supervises activities of POs and 
coordinate activities between POs, 
suppliers and customers. 
 Assists the TSC on program-eligible 
equipment specifications. 
The success of the program relies on the ability 
to mobilize the POs and micro-finance 
providers based on their experience and 
knowledge of rural communities in 
Bangladesh to support development of solar 
home systems. 
BARRIERS TO ACCESS 
For Afghanistan, barriers to increasing access 
to electric power, particularly in rural areas—
in addition to policy constraints—have much 
to do with the physical nature of the 
investments required, the large scale of the 
undertaking, and broad country issues (e.g., 
security, remote location, difficult terrain). 
These issues need to be effectively addressed 
through IROA policies and project 
development and implementation. 
Solutions to these problems can be found 
through a mixture of policies and programs 
that continue to rely on IROA involvement in 
the sector (with donor assistance) particularly 
over the short-term while the necessary 
framework is being put into place. These 
programs also need to unleash the potential of 
the domestic and international private sector 
to provide an expanded array of energy 
services and allow the withdrawal over time 
of direct involvement in the sector by the 
IROA and its transition to an oversight and 
regulatory function. 
The IROA needs to explore options for 
achieving this goal and to put in place policies 
and programs that will remove barriers to 
private participation in the energy sector. 
Examples of supportive policies and programs 
include “Light Handed Regulation for Stand 
Alone Systems” similar to that currently 
practiced by the Omary Electric Company. 
However, to be effective this needs to be part 
of an official IROA policy for rural 
electrification. The policy would allow selfcontained power systems in rural or urban 
areas to be “self-regulating” in terms of setting 
service quality, pricing, connection and 
disconnection standards, billing, etc. and 
would apply to cooperative or private sector 
providers. Basic licensing, safety and technical 
standards would be applied by the GOA. 
The need for small-scale, site specific 
solutions means that significant technical 
and financial resources are required to 
bring modern energy services to the bulk 
of the rural population. Given the scope of 
the problem and the limitations on 
Government resources, it is particularly 
important to prioritize specific means 
measures to be pursued in order to 
maximize impact and ensure 
sustainability. The Government should 
seek to promote rural electrification with 
an emphasis on income-generating 
activities where possible. 
This underscores the importance of 
maximizing the benefit of limited 
resources and of considering the tradeoffs within an overall Energy Sector 
Strategy of rural versus urban programs; 
government versus private intervention; 
and fossil versus renewable energy 
resources. Given the scope of rural energy 
needs and the limitations on IROA 
resources, it is important to prioritize 
specific measures to be pursued, to ensure 
that they meet IROA objectives and the 
effort by the GOA, donors and NGOs are 
properly coordinated to maximize results. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
To accomplish these goals within the Energy 
Sector Strategy, the following activities should 
be pursued. 
1. Increase collaboration between 
MEW and MRRD and Delineate Responsibility for Rural Energy Development. As noted under 
the Electricity Sector section, responsibility for 
all rural-remote energy efforts should be 
consolidated within one institution, RLED, 
with membership by all stakeholders to help 
coordinate rural-remote energy programs and 
projects. It appears that the MRRD is the 
proper entity to head up this effort. Rural 
energy is defined as off grid applications such 
as SHS, micro-hydro, and diesels in areas of 
less than 2,500 persons. It could also include 
the use of wind power for both electrical and 
mechanical energy, for example. It would not 
include any grid connected applications. It 
also includes rural electrification. Since there 
is no universal definition of rural, the 
definition for this purpose is something needs 
to work out. REDA would also be responsible 
for developing a rural-remote energy master 
plan. 
 2. In collaboration with NURC, 
develop Rural Energy Policy to include Light 
Handed Regulation as an official policy of the 
IROA and implemented by the MRRD to 
promote development of stand-alone rural 
energy systems by cooperatives or the private 
sector. Policy and regulation must set 
guidelines for cost-recovery. In essence all 
project need to be able to recover operation 
and maintenance costs and set aside a sinking 
fund for capital replacement. The rural energy 
policy and master plan will investigate 
appropriate fuels for cooking.
3. Develop a Methodology for 
Assessing Rural and Renewable Energy 
Resources and Technologies, including hydro 
(large scale, mini and micro), diesel, 
solar, wind, biomass; and evaluating and 
prioritizing potential projects based on 
expected benefits; and a rural and renewable 
energy development program needs to be 
incorporated within the IROA’s overall energy 
sector strategy, including an effective 
monitoring and evaluation program. 
 4. Assess and Establish Models 
for Project Ownership and sustainability with 
emphasis on capital and operating 
requirements, government subsidies, and 
financing methods. Models could include 
electric cooperatives, franchises, provincial or 
district government entities, or some 
combination. Any policy needs to incorporate 
household and community involvement to the 
maximum extent possible. 
 5. Assess and Establish Models 
for Technical Support (technical standards, 
installation, O&M support) such as university 
outreach or extension program; 
MRRD/DAMB offices at the district level to 
include rural technical support and funding; 
district or provincial governments; private 
sector involvement. 
6. Pilot Projects utilizing 
alterative project implementation techniques 
(e.g., coops, franchise) and technologies (e.g., 
wind, solar, hydro) need to be developed. 
Best practices in developing, operating, 
monitoring and assessing the benefits for 
projects from within the region and elsewhere 
need to be applied. Pilot projects may also 
include appropriate cooking and heating that 
is not electricity based. CHAPTER IV 
CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES 
To achieve its goals, in addition to providing 
for affordable and sustainable energy 
development the Energy Sector Strategy will 
incorporate mechanisms to support crosscutting issues that impact all energy sector 
initiatives. These include the environment, 
counter narcotics, anti-corruption, gender and 
regional cooperation—in addition to capacity 
building. 
ENVIRONMENT 
Energy, even renewable energy, has an 
environmental impact. This strategy directly 
addresses environmental impacts by: 
 Focusing on policies and projects that 
improve the operating efficiency of 
energy production. It strives to get the 
most energy delivered for the minimum 
environmental impact. For example, 
reducing technical losses or cogeneration. 
 Focusing on policies and projects that 
improve end use efficiency. These are 
areas that seek to reduce the amount of 
energy needed for any given activity. A 
CFL program is one such measure. 
 Shifting investment and production to 
cleaner sources of energy, for example, 
wind power. 
 Through the promotion of combining 
energy supply with income generating 
activities, as incomes increase, there is 
less pressure on natural assets. And, 
 Through focusing on appropriate energy 
such as better cooking fuels and better 
lighting, thereby reducing indoor air 
pollution. 
 For oil, gas and coal, current law provides 
a set of environmental requirements to 
conform to NEA regulations. These will 
be incorporated into sector implementing 
rules and regulations. In addition, all 
environmental impact assessment and 
pollution control provisions of the 
Afghanistan Environmental Law will 
complied with in regard to the 
construction, upgrading and operation of 
facilities and infrastructure for the 
generation, transmission, distribution and 
use of electricity developed through this 
strategy. 
 The National Environmental Protection 
Agency (NEPA) will issue new 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
regulations in conjunction with the 
Ministry of Justice. Energy sector 
institutions, including the MEW, MoM, 
and MRRD will establish a working 
relationship with the NEPA to learn 
about the EIA process and ensure that its 
provisions are incorporated into all 
energy sector activities. 
ANTI-CORRUPTION 
The energy strategy directly tackles corruption 
in several ways. One of the most important 
measures for reducing corruption is limiting 
the role or influence of Government. In 
energy, we are promoting increased private 
sector participation; we are reducing the role 
of Government. Additionally, in SOE’s, such 
as DABM, we introduced loss reduction 
programs that are targeted at finding and 
deploying ways of controlling corruption. We 
are also introducing better, more transparent 
procurement procedures. Furthermore, 
increasing private investment in the energy 
sector requires rule-of-law and increased 
transparency and accountability; thereby 
indirectly strengthening anti-corruption, and 
anti-narcotics measures. Finally, the 
introduction of a multi-sector regulator 
outside the concerned ministries and under the Ministry of Economy will provide greater 
oversight. 
REGION COOPERATION 
The most important areas furthering regional 
cooperation include expansion of energy trade 
by upgrading electricity transmission ties with 
Central Asian countries and exploring options 
for transport of electricity and natural gas 
through Afghanistan for regional supply. The 
NEPS represents one of the largest sector 
investments and the cornerstone of success in 
NEPS is expanded energy trade. Technical 
standards and commercial instruments will be 
developed. Physical investments are being 
made to improve trade. CASA 1000 is looking 
at using Afghanistan as an energy transit 
corridor. Regional cooperation will be 
enhanced by projects such as NEPS and efforts 
to increase cost-effective electricity imports 
from neighboring countries. 
GENDER AND POVERTY 
REDUCTION 
Most energy interventions have the potential 
to provide positive benefits for women and 
children in particular and also for the poor in 
general. For example, women have specific 
energy needs in water pumping, agriculture 
processing, security, work productivity and 
health – most often that energy is provided by 
their own effort meaning that work 
significantly longer days than men. More 
efficient stoves, drinking water pumping and 
agro-processing can reduce women's 
workloads, improve their health, and expand 
income-earning potential. 
The energy sector has the potential to provide 
a wide pool of jobs as it is developed; for 
example, in the construction and repair of 
thermal plants, in coal mines, and in oil fields. 
Labor intensive construction methods should 
be considered. For skilled technical jobs, the 
energy sector can initiate training and 
apprenticeship schemes to provide on the job 
experience for new trade and technical 
graduates and engineers. Foreign personnel 
can contribute to such schemes as mentors and 
can also be tapped to advice on competency
based occupational analyses, new curricula for 
training colleges and universities. Planning for 
major energy development projects should 
involve an employment audit which 
indicates numbers of temporary and 
permanent jobs expected; plans for training 
and replacement of foreign workers. 
COUNTER NARCOTICS 
The strategy does not directly address this 
issue but it is clear that increased economic 
growth supported by an expanded energy 
sector particularly in rural and remote areas 
will help counter the cultivation of poppies 
and illicit drug trade. In many programs that 
have targeted poppy areas, success has been 
made when alternative livelihoods are found. 
A cornerstone of this strategy is the linking of 
energy supply to income generating activities. 
CAPACITY BUILDING 
Finally, the major emphasis within the Energy 
Sector Strategy placed on institutional 
strengthening and capacity building—and on 
institutional reform, such as consolidating 
authority over rural electrification and rural 
energy projects and separating policymaking 
from regulatory authority—will result in 
fostering a professional, open environment 
and increase opportunities for participation in 
energy sector activities on behalf customers 
and other stakeholders. This, in turn will 
support achievement of the ANDS crosscutting goals. The strategy explicitly provides 
for capacity building projects and capacity 
building is one of the four pillars of the 
strategy. 
Achieving improvements in capacity building 
requires a coordinated approach. The IROA 
has recently initiated the National Capacity 
Building Policy and Program designed to 
effectively address capacity building and 
training needs throughout the Government. It 
establishes an Inter-Ministerial Committee to 
coordinate and monitor capacity building 
efforts throughout the IROA to ensure their 
effectiveness. To improve program 
implementation and effectiveness, it 
established Reform Implementation 
Management Units (RIMU) within IROA 
Ministries. All capacity building initiatives 
developed through the Energy Sector Strategy 
will operate through this mechanism, and will include elements to address crosscutting 
issues. 
Moreover, achievement of counter narcotics 
and anti-corruption goals will be promoted 
through Energy Strategy efforts to expand 
access to electricity and promote economic 
development in rural and remote areas and to 
reform the sector by separating policy, 
regulatory, and operational function and 
promoting involvement by the private sector. 
COORDINATION AND 
EFFECTIVENESS: 
1. Government. Use of the ICE mechanism as 
well as improved public information will be 
essential for improved government 
coordination in the energy sector. Ideally, 
some now related if not duplicated energy 
functions at various ministries will be 
consolidated and appropriate line ministry 
“terms of references” for sector aspects will be 
drafted and agreed to. 
2. International Community. While an ICE 
working group on donor coordination will be 
effective, it is essential that the donors 
themselves improve the way in which they are 
engaged with the Afghan energy sector. At 
present there are 25 donors engaged in the 
sector; in addition there are 15 different US 
agencies. Afghan counterpart resources are 
limited and stretched; donors need to respect 
these limits. 
RISK ASSESSMENT 
1 Sector Governance, Firmly entrenched 
practices of how Government implements 
sector operations have resulted in perceived 
and actual risk for viable private sector 
investment. A lack of legal and regulatory 
basis from which investors ordinarily operate, 
no technical standards and a disperse array of 
institutions responsible for sector 
development create serious risk for 
transparent procurement, contract certainty, 
predictability of the market and overall 
investor confidence. 
2 Security outside sector control, Whether 
sometimes perceived or often real, security 
aspects of infrastructure development in 
Afghanistan remain at the fore of investor 
concerns. 
3 Hardware and technical capacity Virtually 
none of the equipment, supplies or spare parts 
required to operate the energy sector are 
produced or even available in the country. 
When they are on the local market they are 
often of seriously technically inferior quality 
and at very high cost. Some of the larger 
equipment (i.e., diesel generators, drilling rigs) 
can take up to one year to procure or to lease. 
Much of the modern technology that is being 
installed to upgrade the power sector has 
never been part of the system and no staff 
capacity exists to operate same; capacity 
building that includes health and safety 
awareness 
is essential.CHAPTER V 
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Monitoring and Evaluation Reporting System: 
A.1 Overall Reporting, Because of the diversity and breadth of energy sector operations, it is 
impossible to have one reporting system; different technical, financial and operational 
reporting is required. Still, there are common reporting requirements and approaches that will 
be followed. 
 Sector Specific Reporting through Regulatory Bodies. It is expected that the cadastre and 
inspectorate functions for hydrocarbons and mining will be operational by end August 
2008. More momentum for power regulation is required but will also provide reporting 
requirements and monitoring standards presently absent from the sector. Liquid fuels will 
also benefit from some external regulation. Ultimately, the establishment of a multi-sector 
regulatory body is possible (i.e., would regulate oil, natural gas, coal, electricity, liquid 
fuels, renewable) 
 ICE. Through the ICE mechanism very definite reporting schedules have been instituted 
tracking high-priority projects (i.e., Northeast Power System) as well as identifying project 
funding and other gaps. This mechanism will continue to play an important role in how 
energy developments are tracked and monitored by Government. 
A.2 Project-based reporting, Because many energy projects are donor funded, international standard 
reporting and monitoring mechanisms are in place. Government will abide by these requirements and 
where possible, adopt them to line ministry and overall sector project developments otherwise funded.
