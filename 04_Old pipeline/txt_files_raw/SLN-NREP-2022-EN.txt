Similar to global trends, renewable energy targets in national policy documents (national policies, plans, 
roadmaps or laws) and targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are not always in sync in 
small island developing states (SIDS).1
While targets may be updated in the NDC, this update may not always be reflected in national policy documents 
– which are more binding at the national level than NDCs. Similarly, a country may have targets in national 
policy documents, but these may not be indicated as part of its NDC, which represents a commitment made 
to the international community. This makes it difficult to compare the two targets and derive any meaningful 
conclusions. 
• In cases where renewable energy targets in national policy documents predate the NDCs by several years 
(e.g. eight years in Grenada’s case), the differences in targeted capacity may be significant. This may be 
due to the two targets being set in very different contexts. As such, for countries that have not updated 
their NDCs and national policy documents in tandem, and where the time gap between when they were 
published is relatively large, comparing the two may not produce meaningful results. 
• Similarly, in countries where renewable power targets in NDCs predate those in national policy documents, 
the targets may be set in very different contexts. Again, in this case comparing the two may not produce 
any meaningful conclusions, although this may emphasise the fact that renewable energy deployment in 
SIDS is mostly driven by objectives beyond climate. 
For countries that have updated targets in both their NDCs and national policy documents, and where the time 
gap between them is relatively short, the comparison is more meaningful and some trends can be identified, 
giving insights on 1) the level of ambition of nationally binding targets in country plans compared with those in 
NDCs; 2) the importance of international collaboration for deploying renewables and achieving targets; and 3) 
the drivers for renewable energy deployment beyond climate. 
Collectively, the renewable energy targets set in national policy documents are more ambitious than the 
targets set in NDCs. 
If all national targets were achieved, total renewable power capacity in SIDS would reach 13 gigawatts (GW) 
by 2030, which is 1.5 GW higher than the targeted capacity in NDCs (conditional and unconditional combined). 
Achieving these targets would require renewable power capacity to more than double compared with 2021 
levels. While this makes up a small portion of the renewable energy deployment required globally to reach 
the 1.5°C Scenario, it would have a transformational impact in many SIDS, notably for their socio-economic 
development, energy security and independence. However, the level of ambition varies between countries.
The international community plays an instrumental role in scaling up renewable energy in SIDs and 
unleashing its multifaceted benefits. 
More than half of the collective renewable power targeted capacity in NDCs in SIDS is conditional on 
international support in the form of financing, technical assistance, technology transfer, capacity building and 
other forms of support based on each country’s national context. 
Since 2009, commitments for energy-related development aid to SIDS have been rising and shifting towards 
renewables, particularly solar, although non-renewables such as oil-fired plants continue to be funded. But 
disbursement rates remain low, suggesting implementation problems. Furthermore, energy-related aid is 
unevenly flowing between SIDS as the allocations made to individual countries have had little correlation with 
their income levels or energy access gaps. Moreover, improvements in access to electricity have been slow in 
those countries where the gap is largest (Atteridge and Savvidou, 2019).strengthening co-ordinated efforts with SIDS and development partners to support the acceleration of 
their energy transition. IRENA, in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the 
NDC Partnership and other partners, is supporting 18 SIDS2 in their NDC enhancement and implementation 
including, but not limited to: the development of energy management methodology for greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions; target tracking; roadmaps for the electrification of the transport sector and emerging technologies 
such as green hydrogen and ocean energy; rooftop solar simulation; energy monitoring, reporting and 
verification; mitigation scenarios; project facilitation; and access to finance (IRENA, 2022a).
Renewable energy deployment is driven by policy objectives beyond climate (e.g. socio-economic 
development, energy security and independence). 
Some countries have set targets in their national policy documents that are equal to those in NDCs and 
are not conditional on any external support (e.g. Bahamas, Bahrain, Mauritius and Singapore).3
 This shows 
international support is not a prerequisite for achieving these commitments, although it should be noted that all 
countries in this category are high-income countries as per the World Bank’s income classification for countries. 
Commitment to renewable energy deployment can be driven by objectives beyond climate, such as reliable 
energy supply, food and water security, among other objectives (Figure 1). 
2 Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Fiji, Grenada, Mauritius, Palau, Papua New Guinea, 
Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, São Tomé and Príncipe, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Tonga, 
and Trinidad and Tobago. 3 These countries are categorised as high-income countries as per the World Bank Group classifications (except for 
Marshall Islands).
Figure 1 Drivers for renewable energy deployment beyond climate
Some SIDS have made unconditional commitments in their NDCs without pronouncing a target in their 
national policy documents. Examples include Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname and Tuvalu. These 
commitments should be made more operational by reflecting them in national policy. 
Other countries have made commitments but rely on support from the international community. These fall 
under several categories:
• Countries that have not made any binding commitments in their national policy documents but as per 
their NDCs, they are committed to deploying renewables should international support be provided. These 
include countries such as Haiti, Nauru, Saint Kitts and Nevis, São Tomé and Príncipe, and 
Timor-Leste.4

 FOR RENEWABLE 
ENERGY 
DEPLOYMENT
IN SIDSNDCs that are conditional on international support. This may mean that while renewable energy is a high 
priority, these countries could deploy even more renewable energy if the appropriate financial, technical, 
technological and other forms of assistance were made available. These include Belize, the Dominican 
Republic and Guinea-Bissau. 
• Countries that have set targets in their national policy documents that are equal to the conditional targets 
set in the NDCs. This includes countries such as Dominica, Palau, Saint Lucia, Samoa, Seychelles and 
Vanuatu. This could mean that while renewable energy is a national priority, these countries may be 
looking to fund their objectives by securing climate financing from external sources. 
• Some countries have made national commitments that are more ambitious than their conditional targets 
in NDCs. Similar to the preceding category, these countries may be looking to secure climate financing to 
fund at least part of their targeted capacity. Alternatively, it could mean that the national targets are 
aspirational. Countries in this category include Barbados, Cook Islands, Grenada, Papua New Guinea
and Tonga. 
• Countries that have set both conditional and unconditional targets in their NDCs, as well as made national 
commitments, can be broken down into two categories: 
» The national target is between unconditional and conditional; this means that there is a strong 
commitment that is unconditional, but the country is willing to do more should further support be 
available. 
» The national target is equal to the sum of conditional and unconditional NDC targets. This could 
mean countries are looking to secure climate financing to fund at least a part of their targeted 
renewable energy deployment. Examples include Guyana and Niue. 
Finally, there are countries that have not set any targets in either their national policy documents or their 
NDCs. These include Comoros and Micronesia. 
NDCS IN SIDS UPDATED AS OF MID-OCTOBER 2022 
By mid-October 2022, 193 Parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 194 had submitted NDCs.5 Of the 
166 Parties that submitted new or updated NDCs, only 99 Parties representing 81% of global GHG emissions 
submitted enhanced ambitions.6 Of the remaining Parties that submitted new or updated NDCs in 2022, 67 
Parties (accounting for a further 14% of global emissions in 2019) submitted NDCs with either the same emission 
reduction targets, increased emissions compared to their first NDCs, or emission reduction targets that are not 
comparable with their initial NDCs (IRENA, 2022b).
Although SIDS make up a small portion of the world’s mitigation potential, they are increasingly capitalising on 
their renewable energy resources to mitigate and adapt to their climate-induced vulnerabilities while ensuring 
energy security and sustainable socio-economic growth. 
Overall, of the 40 SIDS that have ratified the Paris Agreement, all have submitted an NDC to date. Around 29 
SIDS have submitted new, updated or second NDCs since September 2020.7
 From this, a total of 18 SIDS have 
increased ambition in terms of their GHG reduction targets (Climate Watch, 2022).8 Overall, 32 SIDS have a 
quantifiable renewable energy target in their NDCs. 
5 As of 16 October 2022, Eritrea had not ratified the Paris Agreement but had submitted an NDC. 6 These countries revised their emission targets upwards compared to targets submitted previously. 7 Antigua and Barbuda, Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Cabo Verde, Comoros, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Fiji, Grenada, 
Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Jamaica, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, 
Samoa, São Tomé and Príncipe, Seychelles, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Suriname, Tonga, Vanuatu. 8 Barbados, Cabo Verde, Comoros, the Dominican Republic, Fiji, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Jamaica, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, have set specific targets in end uses such as transport and heating/cooling, and three have set their targets 
as a percentage of the whole energy mix. Some SIDS have included measures for sector coupling, e.g. across 
energy and agriculture. 
Many of the SIDS have committed to 100% renewables in their electricity mix by or before 2030. Although 
climate is a major driver for renewables deployment in these countries, increased ambition is also driven by 
energy security and other socio-economic benefits, which are adversely affected by importing fossil fuels. 
However, the majority of these targets remain conditional on international support in the form of financing, 
technology transfer and technical assistance.
The following section quantifies SIDS’ renewable energy targets as per their NDCs. Unconditional and 
conditional contributions are separated where applicable. Annex 1 includes detailed descriptions of renewable 
energy contributions in SIDS, along with other selected targets,9 as stated in their NDCs. Finally, Annex 2 
compares quantified renewable power targets in NDCs with those in national plans and policies. 
QUANTIFIED RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY CONTRIBUTIONS IN NDCS
Table 1 presents a quantified estimate of the power sector-related renewable energy targets in NDCs of the 
SIDS in terms of capacity in megawatts – conditional and unconditional.10 Although renewable energy targets in 
the power sector – in both NDCs and national energy plans – are typically expressed in terms of fixed capacity 
(in megawatts), in many countries they may be cited as a percentage of the electricity mix (e.g. 45% renewable 
energy share in electricity generation), and in some cases they can be a combination of both. 
In SIDS, 33 Parties have a power target, of which 8 are fixed (capacity-based in terms of megawatts), 14 are 
percentage-based, and another 8 are a combination of the two. In cases where targets are expressed in terms 
of fixed capacity, they are taken as is. In case the target is expressed as a share of a mix, the total electricity 
generation is first calculated based on a ten-year historical compound annual growth rate (CAGR),11 and the 
overall renewable energy generation in the target year is obtained by multiplying the share with the overall 
electricity generation. Next, the technology-specific share in the renewable electricity mix is estimated based 
on the share of technology-specific capacity additions over the last five years. Finally, the megawatt equivalent 
of the target is derived using capacity factor data obtained from IRENA's costs database (IRENA, 2022c). The 
detailed methodology is presented in Annex 1.
Currently, the SIDS that are Parties to the Paris Agreement account for around 5.2 GW of installed capacity 
(IRENA, 2022d). If SIDS continue based on historical trends, their total installed capacity is expected to reach 
less than 6GW by 2030. However, these countries have committed to reach 13GW of renewable power capacity 
by 2030 as per their national energy plans (Figure 1). 
9 Emissions targets are included only if there is a renewable energy–specific component, e.g. Marshall Islands. 10 Since most renewable energy targets focus on the power sector
this analysis focuses on quantifying thoseand targeted capacity based on national plans and NDCs, by 2030
Note: For the NDCs, about 200 MW of conditional capacity and 254 MW of unconditional capacity is targeted for 2031-2040 
and was not included in the chart.
Moreover, their NDCs shows that more than half of the deployment is conditional on international assistance: 
SIDS have committed to reaching 11.5 GW renewable power installed capacity by 2030. The unconditional 
targets total 5.5 GW while the conditional targets are estimated to be equivalent to 6 GW (Table 1). 
This means developed countries will need to provide substantial international support in the form of financial 
and technical assistance, capacity building and technology transfer to help SIDS achieve their renewable energy 
targets.

ANNEX 2 – COMPARISON OF 
RENEWABLE ENERGY TARGETS 
IN NDCS WITH THOSE IN 
NATIONAL ENERGY PLANS
This section compares the renewable energy targets in NDCs with the renewable energy targets in other 
national policy documents such as national plans, policies, roadmaps or laws. As expected, there are some 
discrepancies between the two. This could be due to several reasons. For example, some of the NDC targets 
can be conditional on international support and therefore may be more ambitious. In other cases, the national 
energy policy that is in effect may predate the NDC by many years (and vice versa). This time lag between when 
different documents are updated can result in a difference in the targeted capacity. For example, a target of 
80% renewable energy in the electricity mix by 2030 that was set in 2012 may be set under different demand 
growth assumptions to those that are applicable today. 
ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
• Targets in the NDC are conditional and are ambitious at 270 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 
(up from 16 MW installed capacity in 2020). Renewable energy targets in national plans are estimated to 
total 36 MW. This shows that the country has good renewable energy potential, but realising this potential 
will require international support.

• The updated NDC was submitted in July 2022, superseding the first NDC submitted in September 2016, 
which had a target of 16 MW of renewable installed capacity. This again goes to show that sometimes the 
discrepancy between national policy documents and NDCs can be due to a time lag. • Targets in the NDC are conditional and are more ambitious, amounting to 977 MW of renewable energy 
capacity, compared with the renewable energy targets in the Dominican Republic’s Law 57-07 on

Vanuatu's National Energy Road Map sets the target 
of 100% of electricity from renewable sources by 
2030. The updated roadmap includes an investment 
plan for the period 2016-21 with renewable energy 
capacity and costs per technology as follows: 8 MW of 
geothermal at a cost of USD 108 million; 3 MW of solar 
at a cost of USD 11 million; 1.8 MW of hydropower at a 
cost of USD 9.85 million; five solar pico-grids at a cost 
of USD 2.1 million; and USD 16.6 million to 
USD 17.1 million for off-grid solar, including mini-grids, 
solar lighting industrial centres and agro-processing 
power stations (Government of Vanuatu, 2016).

• Both the NDC and Vanuatu's National Energy Road Map set the target of 100% of electricity from 
renewable sources by 2030. This is equivalent to 47 MW installed capacity by 2030.
• The target cited in the NDC is conditional – this signals that the country will need international support to 
realise its renewable energy ambitions as outlined in its National Energy Road Map. ANNEX 2 – METHODOLOGY
All targets in the power sector are quantified in terms of capacity in megawatts. While renewable energy 
targets in the power sector – in both NDCs and national energy plans – are typically expressed in terms of fixed 
capacity (in megawatts), in many countries they may be cited as a percentage of the electricity mix (e.g. 45% 
renewable energy share in electricity generation), and in some cases they may be a combination of both. 
In SIDS, 33 parties have a power target of which 8 are fixed (capacity based in terms of megawatts), 14 are 
share-based, and another 8 are a combination of the two.
The estimation method for these three cases is described below: 
1. If a country expresses fixed targets in terms of megawatts, the target is taken as is.
If the target is expressed as a share (e.g. Country A plans to reach 68% share of renewable energy in the 
electricity generation mix by 2030), the following steps are followed:
a. Overall electricity generation is obtained (if unavailable in official national data) or approximated based on 
a ten-year historical CAGR.12
 Given that for some countries (e.g. many SIDS), baseline generation was very low, 
resulting in a very high growth rate that may not be realistic to project into the future, a growth rate of 1-2% is 
often assumed. 
b. The overall renewable energy generation in the target year is obtained by multiplying the targeted 
share with the overall electricity generation. 
c. Next, the technology-specific share in the renewable electricity mix is obtained (if unavailable in 
official national data) or estimated. The shares are assumed to equal the share of a technologyspecific capacity addition in the overall renewable capacity added over the last five years. For 
example, for a technology such as solar, the capacity added between 2017 and 2021 is divided by the 
overall renewable capacity added during this period. This share is assumed to be the same as the 
“technology-specific share in the renewable electricity mix in the target year”. Note that some 
adjustments are inevitable to account for baseline capacity for technologies that have had no recent 
deployment (which is often the case for hydropower and bioenergy).
d. Once the technology-specific generation in target year is obtained, the following formula is used to 
calculate the megawatt equivalent of the target. Capacity factor data are obtained from IRENA’s costs 
database.
2.In cases where targets are expressed as both a share of electricity mix and fixed capacity, e.g. “Country A 
plans to reach 68% share of renewable energy share by 2030; specific measures include the addition of 
30 MW of solar PV”, it is assessed whether the fixed capacity target will alone be enough to reach the 
targeted share. In case it will not be enough, the percentage-based target is estimated and adjusted 
based on the fixed capacity target. 
Note: Certain assumptions and approximations are made to account for the gaps and ambiguities in available 
data. These are made on a country-by-country basis to reflect local conditions where possible. 
Data on energy generation and renewable energy capacity can be found at IRENA’s website here. Data on 
renewable energy costs can be found here.
