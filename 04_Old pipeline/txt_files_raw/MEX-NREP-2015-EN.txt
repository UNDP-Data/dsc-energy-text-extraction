energy in the global energy mix by 2030. It represents an unprecedented international effort that brings together the work of more than 90 national experts in nearly 60 countries. 
Following the global REmap report released in June 2014, the International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA) is now releasing a series of country-specific reports built on the 
same detailed analysis.
As the second largest energy consumer in Latin America, Mexico is committed to contributing to the global transition 
to a sustainable energy future. Mexico is one of the world’s largest crude oil and natural gas producers, but its natural 
gas imports are rising. Mexico has the opportunity to exploit its rich potential in renewables to diversify its energy supply, reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions, lower health dangers, create jobs and combat energy poverty.
Mexico is seizing the chance and reshaping its energy policy to promote renewables. It has recently enacted a major 
reform that opens energy markets to competition, creating new opportunities for renewable energy development. The 
country is fast emerging as a leader of a Latin American energy transformation.
This REmap 2030 report shows how the country can achieve the transition to renewable energy, suggesting specific 
and practical pathways that would result in a clean and secure energy system. Mexico can achieve this through concerted actions to take advantage of its excellent renewable resource potential, building upon the progress made so far. 
If Mexico continues on its path towards a sustainable energy future, it will be recognised as a leader not just in Latin 
America but also in the rest of the world.

In Paris later this year, the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) will take 
place against a background of scientific agreement, that alterations in the planet´s climate 
system have been induced by human activity. If we are to change our path, we will have to 
move towards a sustainable energy economy, by scaling up the use of clean technologies. 
To make the transition to a low-carbon economy, the first step is to match demand for energy services with a sustainable energy supply.
Mexico has set the process in motion by establishing a consultative council on renewable 
energy, including representatives from academia, industry, the public sector and the legislature. The council has sole responsibility for advising on the development of sector-specific 
public policies. Its first task was to assess the country’s renewable energy resources, resulting in the creation of the National Renewable Energy Inventory.
As part of Mexico’s commitment to the sustainability of the energy sector, we are publishing our experiences of developing this inventory. We have also joined forces with IRENA in developing REmap 2030, which promotes international 
cooperation to enable a doubling of the share of renewables in the energy mix.
If we are to double the renewable energy share in Latin America by 2030, countries in the region must work together. 
All of us need to promote energy trade, exchanges of expertise and harmonisation of standards. We must create the 
physical interconnections, as well as market interactions, to move towards a low-carbon energy future.
As this report emphasises, Mexico has the potential to lead such a shift.

HIGHLIGHTS
● Mexico has a large and diverse renewable energy resource base. Given the right mix of policies, Mexico 
has the potential to attract large-scale investment in renewables that can help diversify its energy 
supply. Increased renewable energy use would also set Mexico on a pathway toward significantly 
reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, development has been limited so far.
● Under current plans, the share of modern renewable energy in total final energy consumption (TFEC) is 
forecast to increase from 4.4% in 2010 (base year of this analysis) to 10% in 2030. According to REmap 
2030, Mexico has the potential to increase this share to 21% by 2030. This implies a threefold growth in 
total renewable energy use in absolute terms from 0.5 exajoules (EJ) to 1.5 EJ in 2010-30.
● By 2030, Mexico could generate up to 46% of its electricity each year, or 280 terawatt-hours (TWh), 
from renewable sources. This compares with 18% using business-as-usual developments (116 TWh/
year). To achieve a 46% share of renewables in electricity generation, the country is likely to see the 
greatest deployment in wind (30 gigawatts (GW)) and solar photovoltaic (PV) (30 GW). Together 
these could account for 26% of total power generation in 2030. Small and large hydropower (26 GW) 
could contribute 12% of total power generation, with geothermal energy supplying 5% (4.5 GW) and 
biomass 2.5% (4 GW).
● If renewables uptake were accelerated, all traditional uses of biomass for cooking or heating in the 
buildings sector would be replaced by modern forms of renewable energy. Total biomass consumption 
in all end-use sectors for heating or as transport fuels could reach 685 petajoules (PJ) by 2030. This 
represents more than one third of total renewable energy use. Total installed capacity of solar thermal 
applications for heating/cooling in buildings and industry would amount to 33 GW, making up almost 
one tenth of the country’s renewable energy consumption.
● Renewables can be an important driver for diversifying Mexico’s energy supply. Renewable energy has 
the potential to reduce Mexico’s total coal demand by 62%, natural gas by 21% and oil by 6% compared 
to business as usual to 2030. As a result, total natural gas demand would grow by 115% in 2010-2030 
compared to 175% under business as usual.
● Accelerating Mexico’s uptake of renewable energy could result in savings of 7.2 US dollars (USD) per 
megawatt-hour (MWh) compared to the equivalent new capacity with conventional generation. This 
saving would equate to 9% of the production cost of natural gas-fired power generation in 2030.
● The result of this higher renewable energy uptake is an annual net savings of USD 1.6 billion in Mexico’s 
total energy system cost by 2030. Meanwhile, if the benefits resulting from lower harm to health 
and reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are taken into account, savings could amount to USD 
4.6 billion and 11.6 billion respectively each year.
● To achieve such gains, policy changes in the power market are needed. Planning is essential for 
transmission, expansion and grid integration to accommodate the full range of renewable power 
technologies.
● New policies are also needed to promote the uptake of renewable energy for heat and fuel applications 
in the buildings, industry and transport sectors.Building a renewable energy market
Mexico accounts for one fifth of all energy use in Latin 
America, and demand is growing fast. Business-asusual growth will result in an increase of installed power 
generation capacity from 64 GW in 2013 to 118 GW in 
2030. Mexico is the world’s tenth largest oil and natural 
gas producer. However, natural gas and coal imports are 
growing, and its dependence on natural gas for power 
generation has become a major concern. To address 
these and other challenges, Mexico enacted a series of 
energy reforms in December 2013. These opened up the 
energy sector to new players and new ideas, and are 
set to gradually remove subsidies for oil products and 
electricity tariffs over the coming years.
In order to fulfil its international GHG reduction pledges, 
Mexico has also set a clean energy power generation 
target for 2050. The aim is to reach a share of as much 
as 40% in power generation from zero or low-emission 
energy types by 2035, and 50% by 2050. This includes 
renewables as well as nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon 
capture and storage. Renewable energy also offers great 
potential for fostering social and economic development 
in Mexico’s relatively remote and poorer regions. Mexico is 
taking measures to provide modern energy to nearly three 
million people in rural areas who lack access to electricity, 
and to reduce the use of traditional biomass in cooking.
These trends have boosted the case for renewable energy deployment. Mexico has a large and diverse renewable energy resource base. However, development has 
been limited, so that significant opportunities remain. 
With the right mix of policies, Mexico can attract largescale investment in renewables.
REmap 2030: Mexico’s renewable 
energy potential
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has 
developed a global renewable energy roadmap called 
REmap 2030. This shows how the share of renewables in 
the global energy mix can be doubled by 2030, both realistically and cost-effectively. This is in line with one of the 
key objectives of the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) 
initiative led by the United Nations (UN). REmap 2030 
is the result of a collaborative process between IRENA, 
national experts within each of the 26 countries covered 
by the analysis to date and other stakeholders.
This study is the joint work of IRENA and the Mexican 
Ministry of Energy (SENER). It identifies the country’s 
possible development path to increase the use of renewables across its entire energy system by 2030. This 
is one of the first country reports to be released in the 
REmap 2030 series as part of the IRENA roadmap for 
doubling the global share of renewables.
Mexico is only just beginning to draw on its large renewable energy potential. As of 2013, total renewable 
energy capacity in the power sector was 14.2 GW out of 
64 GW total system capacity. This share was composed 
mainly of hydropower (18% of total installed capacity), 
followed by wind and geothermal (with a combined 
total of around 4%).
Meanwhile, the renewable energy share in the industry 
and transport sectors in 2010 (the base year of this 
analysis) was 5% and 0.8%, respectively. This was largely 
derived from the combustion of bagasse by-products for 
industrial process heat generation based on bioenergy, 
as well as from liquid biofuels. Although the renewables 
share was higher in the building sector, more than a 
quarter of that was attributable to the traditional use of 
biomass (firewood and forestry residues). This is often 
not sustainably sourced and is not considered a modern 
form of renewable energy for the purpose of this analysis.
According to SENER and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) predictions, Mexico’s share of modernised renewable energy will only reach 10% of TFEC by 
2030 under business as usual. This amounts to more 
than twice the proportion of 4.4% in 2010. Considered in 
the light of a 64% growth expected in TFEC, this means 
a substantial renewable energy scale-up with a significant acceleration compared to historic trends. Even so, 
the REmap analysis shows far more is possible.
REmap 2030 estimates a portfolio of technology options to accelerate renewable energy deployment across 
Mexico’s entire energy system that could raise the 2030 
share to 21%. This implies a threefold increase in total 
renewable energy use in the same period.
Renewable power generation: wind 
and solar take the lead
Based on REmap 2030, more than half of Mexico’s total 
renewable energy use would be in the electricity sector. Mexico has the potential to generate 280 TWh of renewable power by 2030, representing a sixfold increase over 
today’s level of 48 TWh. Achieving this would require 
a diversified mix of wind, solar, hydro, geothermal and 
biomass power technologies.
Wind and solar PV combined would account for nearly 
60% of Mexico’s renewable power generation, and 
26% of total generation in 2030. Reaching this level 
of deployment requires policies that take into account 
Mexico’s major land area, in which demand and supply 
are often far apart. The country has the potential for significant power generation from biomass and geothermal sources, which are also some of the least expensive 
power supply options.
Wind power represents a major opportunity across 
both the north and the south of Mexico, with the potential to produce 92 TWh of electricity per year by 
2030. Nearly all of this would be derived from onshore 
wind. In the context of the country’s total installed wind 
power capacity of 1.7 GW in 2013, a total of 30 GW in 
2030 would require an average annual installation rate 
of 1.7 GW.
Solar PV could contribute 30 GW of power capacity, 
generating 66 TWh of electricity per year in 2030. This 
would require an average annual installation rate of 
1.5 GW. A quarter of the total installed capacity in 2030 
would be in the form of distributed PV and mini-grid applications for street lighting, agricultural water pumping 
and mobile phone towers (7 GW). An additional 1.5 GW 
would come from concentrated solar power (CSP).
Bioenergy for power generation would amount to 
around 4 GW of capacity. Approximately 1 GW of this 
would come from biomass co-firing in coal plants and 
1.8 GW from combined heat and power (CHP) in the 
manufacturing industry.
Mexico already has the world’s fifth largest geothermal 
power installed capacity after the US, the Philippines, 
Indonesia and New Zealand, and could utilise its hightemperature reservoir potential to reach 4.5 GW in 
2030.
Under current plans, Mexico would reach 17 GW of large 
hydropower capacity by 2030. According to REmap, a 
further 6.5 GW could be installed. Small hydropower 
capacity is already forecast to reach 1.8 GW, equivalent 
to an annual addition of 90 megawatts (MW) in 2015-
30, or about ten small hydropower plants per year. Total 
installed hydropower capacity would reach 26 GW under REmap 2030.
System integration and expansion of transmission capacity will be essential to ensure the smooth integration 
of renewables. This is particularly true given the 26% 
share of variable renewable energy estimated in the accelerated case in REmap 2030. Additional transmission 
capacity must be planned to exploit wind and solar PV 
capacity in the northern and western parts of Mexico, 
which are distant from population centres and industrial 
activity. The first step will be to fulfil plans to connect 
Baja California and Baja California Sur to the main grid, 
both of which have significant resources of solar and 
wind. It will also be important to plan for rooftop distributed generation. Mexico covers a large area and has 
many scattered communities. This means mini-grid and 
rural electrification will play a crucial role, particularly in 
helping diminish the challenge of grid integration and 
transmission capacity expansion.
Using renewables to meet transport, 
buildings and industry energy needs
The other half of total renewable energy use in REmap 
2030 would come from non-electricity needs in the 
transport, buildings and industry end-use sectors.
Modern renewables for heating, cooling and cooking 
in buildings and industry offer the greatest growth 
potential, although their use is limited today. Renewable energy use for heating is currently dominated by 
traditional biomass use, with a small share of bagasse 
combustion used for industrial process heat and power 
generation. Solar water heating for buildings is also 
limited, but there is great potential to replace liquefied 
petroleum gas (LPG) in this market segment as LPG 
subsidies are phased out.
REmap 2030 estimates that solar thermal capacity for 
heating and cooling could reach 33 GW. This includes 
13 GW of heating in the manufacturing industry, which 
represent 6% of heat demand. The buildings sector would 
account for 20 GW of solar water heaters, contributing 
25% of water heating demand. About 5 TWh of power today is used in the residential sector for space cooling, and 
this is estimated to rise to about 20 TWh/year in REmap 2030. To help meet this need, buildings provide an estimated 4 GW of solar cooling potential. This would reduce 
total power demand for cooling in the household sector 
by 5% in REmap 2030. Industry offers the potential for 
7 GW of solar thermal use for low-temperature process 
heat applications (textiles, food production and some 
chemical processes). There is also potential for more than 
2 GW for medium-temperature process heat applications 
using concentrated solar thermal systems (mainly in 
chemicals production). Some niche applications already 
exist in Mexico today in the food sector.
Under current plans, traditional biomass used for cooking will account for 17% of total biomass use in buildings 
in 2030. REmap estimates traditional uses of biomass 
will be replaced by modern and efficient cook stoves 
that use wood for cooking.
Under current policies, only limited growth for renewable energy is forecast for Mexico’s transport sector. 
This is due to rise from 0.8% in 2010 to 2.4% by 2030. In 
REmap 2030 this could climb to 4.2% in 2030 with the 
introduction of about six billion litres of liquid biofuels. 
This would constitute an important step in raising the renewables share in the transport sector, which accounts 
for nearly half of Mexico’s total energy demand today. 
Dedicated policies based on renewables are needed, 
both to increase biofuels uptake and to promote mass 
transportation and electric transport.
In REmap 2030, total use of primary biomass would 
reach 810 PJ/year, mostly for heating in industry and 
buildings. This volume is as much as 10% of Mexico’s 
total primary energy supply in 2010.
Cost and benefits of REmap 2030
Increasing the renewable energy share to 21% of Mexico’s 
total final energy mix would result in financial savings. 
The cost and benefits of renewables are presented in the 
REmap analysis from both business and government 
perspectives. The former is based on the national cost of
capital and commodity prices that include local taxes or 
subsidies. The international or government perspective 
is based on standard international commodity prices 
and a fixed 10% discount rate.
The results from REmap 2030 show that more than half 
of all renewable energy technology options could be deployed with cost savings when compared to conventional 
technology options. From the business perspective, this 
translates into savings of USD 0.4/MWh (USD  0.1 per 
gigajoule (GJ)). From a government perspective, this 
results in savings of USD 7.2/MWh (USD 2/GJ). These 
estimates are based on 2030 capital cost projections 
for energy technologies and assume an increase of 50% 
in fossil fuel prices between 2010 and 2030. These cost 
savings, however, do not account for infrastructure (e.g.,
additional generation or transmission capacity) and enabling technology costs (e.g., grid integration).
Savings related to socio-economic benefits arise from 
increasing the share of renewables as estimated in this 
study. When accounting for externalities resulting from 
reduced health effects and CO2 emissions, total savings 
could be USD 4.6 billion-11.6 billion in 2030. The health 
savings are estimated based on the unit external costs
of sulphur dioxide (SO2), mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
and particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions. These cause
outdoor air pollution from fossil fuel combustion in power generation, heating and transport, as well as through 
traditional biomass use resulting in indoor pollution in 
Mexico. In addition, a price range was assumed of USD
20-80 per tonne of CO2, with the same range applied to 
all other countries in the REmap study.
The replacement of conventional technologies by renewable energy in REmap 2030 cuts fossil fuel demand 
by almost 1.5 EJ by 2030 compared to business as usual. 
Lower fossil fuel demand leads to an estimated reduction of 102 megatonnes (Mt) per year of CO2 emitted by 
2030. This amounts to a 17% reduction compared to the
business-as-usual case in 2030. Three quarters of that 
total mitigation potential comes from the power sector.
Implementing all the options indicated by REmap would 
more than halve Mexico’s total coal demand by 2030 
compared to 2010 levels. REmap Options also represent 
an opportunity to reduce total demand for natural gas
by 21% compared to current policies for 2030. Savings in 
oil products are lower – about a 6% reduction. Two thirds 
of these savings are located in the manufacturing sector.
Policies to accelerate renewable 
energy
Recent progress in renewable energy uptake indicates 
that the country has begun to deploy its high renewable ent renewable energy technologies is accompanied by 
three main challenges:
● building and paying for enabling grid infrastructure to address variability
● planning for the most effective use of solar rooftops in buildings
● securing bioenergy supplies, and replacing the 
use of traditional biomass
Creating and managing knowledge: improving information on renewable energy among policy makers, 
manufacturers, project developers/installers and users 
is essential. Applying appropriate system models to 
create knowledge of Mexico’s power system will provide 
insight into how higher shares of variable renewable 
power generation can be accommodated in terms of 
transmission, demand-side resources and grid operation.
Unleashing innovation: technology innovation will play 
a key role in realizing Mexico’s renewable energy potential. Mexican Energy Innovation Centres have started to 
make important contributions. Expanding these further 
could help the sector to break down barriers related to 
the costs and availability of technologies that have so 
far seen only limited growth. A number of issues are 
under examination in these and other similar centres. 
They include, for instance, construction, testing and 
certification of medium-scale and grid-friendly wind 
turbine concepts, industrial solar thermal innovations, 
and solar-powered cooling systems.
energy potential. But further policies are still needed 
to ensure progress. These recommendations can be 
categorised into five core areas in which action can be 
taken to achieve higher renewable energy shares.
Planning transition pathways: planning for renewable 
power generation capacity needs to go hand in hand 
with planning for related infrastructure. There is a need 
for clear and adequate market operation rules and 
codes for grid connection and access. These need to 
guarantee renewable power capacity development. The 
major low-cost renewable energy potential in the enduse sectors needs to be more fully extracted through 
targeted renewable energy policies. There is a need 
to accelerate the uptake of solar water heating and 
biomass-fired CHP capacity, and new policies will be 
essential to make use of biofuels in Mexico’s transport 
sector.
Creating an enabling business environment: improving cost-effectiveness starts with reducing risks for 
investors in renewable energy, as well as deploying 
new capacity. Suitable policy frameworks are needed 
to implement effective economic, financial and fiscal 
incentives to accelerate investments. Furthermore, the 
market needs mechanisms to account for externalities. 
Continuing the discussion around fossil fuel and renewable subsidies for transport and electricity will also be 
important.
Ensuring smooth integration of renewables into the 
system: the integration of a major proportion of differ-1 INTRODUCTION
individual countries, as well as other stakeholders. The 
current report focuses on the actual and potential role 
of renewable energy in Mexico, the second largest energy consumer in Latin America after Brazil. In 2010 (the 
base year of this analysis), Mexico’s TFEC was 4.5 EJ, 
equivalent to 1.4% of global TFEC (SENER, 2012a) (IEA, 
2013). Half of Mexico’s TFEC in 2010 was consumed in 
the transport sector. Energy consumption in industry 
followed with 30%, 20% in the buildings sector. Finally, 
3% of TFEC was consumed in the agriculture sector.
TFEC in Mexico is projected to increase significantly, 
growing from 4.5 EJ in 2010 to 7.4 EJ in 2030, an increase of nearly 70%. In the same time period, the Reference Case for this study shows that Mexico’s modern 
renewable energy share in TFEC will grow only from 
4.4% (0.2 EJ) in 2010 to 10% (0.74 EJ) in 20302. This is 
based on current policies.
Mexico has significant potential to go beyond its Reference Case developments. According to the REmap 
analysis Mexico could reach a total 1.5 EJ of final renewable energy use, or a 21% renewable energy share in 
TFEC by 2030. This depends on whether the realisable 
potential of all renewable energy technologies identified 
in REmap is deployed. These additional technology potentials are called the REmap Options. Available renewable energy resources include mainly solar, geothermal, 
biomass, wind and hydropower. The first three can be 
used either for power or heat generation, depending 
on resource availability and on the technologies implemented.
This national potential would also contribute to the 
global renewable energy share. Figure 1 provides a 
breakdown of total renewable energy use among the 
26 countries that have developed REmap Options. Six 
of these countries account for over half the total additional renewable energy potential and the worldwide 
REmap Options. Mexico accounts for 1% of the renewable energy potential identified in the Remap 26 country grouping.
2 These shares exclude the use of traditional biomass that, if included, would raise the renewable energy share in TFEC to 10%.
In 2011, the UN Secretary-General launched the SE4All 
initiative with three interlinked objectives to be achieved 
by 2030: (i) ensure universal energy access to modern 
energy services (ii) double the rate of improvement in 
energy efficiency (iii) double the share of renewable 
energy in the global energy mix. In this context, IRENA 
developed a global renewable energy roadmap (REmap 
2030). This is a bottom-up analysis applied to individual countries. It shows how accelerated penetration 
of renewable energy in each case could help double the 
share of renewables in the global energy mix by 2030. 
Key factors to achieve this goal are biomass for heating, power generation and biofuels, wind, solar PV and 
greater electrification of the energy sector. Based on 
an analysis of 26 countries1, REmap 2030 suggests that 
renewable energy expansion, as currently planned, will 
result in a 21% share of renewables worldwide in 2030 
(IRENA, 2014a). This leaves a 15 percentage-point gap 
to achieving a 36% renewable energy share in 2030 as 
indicated in the SE4All Global Tracking Report (Banerjee et al., 2013). REmap 2030 notes specific measures to 
facilitate meeting this target.
REmap 2030 is the result of a collaborative process 
between IRENA and national REmap experts within the 
1 The analysis published in June 2014 included 26 countries that 
account for three quarters of global TFEC. Another 14 countries are being added in 2014/2015 that raise the global coverage to 80%. TFEC includes the total combustible and noncombustible energy use from all energy carriers as fuel (for 
the transport sector) and to generate heat (for industry and 
the building sectors) as well as electricity and district heat. 
It excludes non-energy use. This report uses this indicator to 
measure the renewable energy share, consistent with the Global Tracking Framework report (Banerjee et al., 2013).
TFEC includes the consumption of industry (including blast furnaces and coke ovens, but excluding petroleum refineries), buildings (residential and commercial), transport, agricultural, forestry, 
fishing and other small sectors. The potential of renewables is 
estimated for the industry, buildings and transport sectors accounting for about 97% of TFEC in 2010. In that same year, the 
non-energy use in Mexico was about 7% of total final consumption, 
which includes both the energy and non-energy use of energy carriers. Final non-energetic consumption registers the primary and 
secondary energy consumption as a commodity. This occurs in 
the processes that use inputs for the elaboration of non-energetic 
goods. For example, Mexican Petroleums (PEMEX), a petrochemicals company, uses dry gas and oil derivatives for the production 
of plastics, solvents, polymers, rubber etc. Consumption of sugar 
cane bagasse used for paper production, bonded boards and cattle feed in other sectors are included.of the sector brought about through these reforms is 
opening up participation in energy sector activities 
to new players. Section 6 shows Mexico’s renewables 
potential. Section 7, the core of the report, quantifies 
the potential of the REmap Options. This is followed 
by a discussion of the opportunities for and barriers 
to renewable energy in Mexico (Section 8). Section 9 
provides policy recommendations for an accelerated renewable energy uptake for Mexico. This study assumes 
that all renewable energy options are taken together 
by 2030. However, the last section also includes a discussion of energy sector and policy recommendations 
related to the transition period from now to 2030.
The objective of this report is to provide detailed background data, present the results of Mexico’s REmap 
country analysis, and suggest how these results could 
be translated into action.
The report starts with a brief description of the REmap 
2030 methodology (Section 2). It continues by explaining the present energy situation in Mexico and recent 
trends in renewable energy use (Section 3). Section 4 
provides the details of the Mexico Reference Case. Section 5 discusses the current policy framework and the 
details of Mexico’s energy reform launched in December 
2013. This is important given that the transformation

used for this Mexican analysis. These background data 
are listed in greater detail in the annexes.
REmap is an analytical approach for assessing the gap 
between current national renewable energy plans, additional potential renewable technology options in 2030 
and the SE4All objective to double the global renewable 
energy share by 2030.
REmap 2030 assessments for 26 countries were completed in June 2014, These were Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Germany, India, 
Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico (the present 
analysis), Morocco, Nigeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South 
Africa, South Korea, Tonga, Turkey, Ukraine, the United 
Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United 
States.
The analysis is based on data covering both national 
energy consumption in end-use sectors (buildings, industry and transport) and power generation3. 2010 is 
the base year for this analysis4. This base year data for 
Mexico originates from the national energy balance 
(SENER, 2012a)5.
The Reference Case is the business-as-usual energy scenario for 2030. It reflects policies in place or under consideration, including energy efficiency improvements. 
The Reference Case includes the TFEC of each end-use 
sector and the total generation of the power sector, 
with a breakdown by energy carrier for 2010–2030. The 
Reference Case for Mexico was based on the following 
sources:

Agency (IEA) balances or the APEC Energy Demand and Supply 
Outlook for 2010. These related to energy consumption in the domestic aviation and maritime sector, and biofuels use. The power 
sector numbers have been adjusted according to SENER projections (see Section 3).

Once the Reference Case was prepared, further potential renewable energy technology options were identified. These renewable energy additions are defined as 
REmap Options. A scenario approach was rejected in 
favour of an options approach. This is because REmap

IRENA developed a REmap tool that allows staff and 
external experts to input data in an energy balance for 
2010, 2020 and 2030. They can then assess technology 
options that could be deployed by 2030 in line with 
an accelerated renewable energy deployment. In addition to the information in the annexes of this report, 
a detailed list of these technologies and the related 
background data is provided online7. The tool includes 
the costs (capital, operation and maintenance) and 
technical performance of renewable and conventional 
technologies (fossil fuel, nuclear and traditional use of 
biomass) for each sector analysed. The technical performance is worked out as the reference capacity of 
installation, capacity factor and conversion efficiency. 
Sectors covered include industry, buildings, transport 
and power.

Each renewable energy technology is characterised 
by its costs, and the cost of each REmap Option is 
represented by its substitution cost. Substitution costs 
are the difference between the annualised cost of the 
REmap Option and of a conventional technology used 
to produce the same amount of energy. This is divided 
by the total renewable energy use in final energy terms 
(in 2010 USD/GJ8 of final renewable energy). This indicator provides a comparable metric for all renewable energy technologies identified in each sector. Substitution 
costs are the key indicators for assessing the economic 
viability of REmap Options. They depend on the type 
of conventional technology replaced, energy prices and 
the characteristics of the REmap Option. The cost can 
be positive (incremental) or negative (savings). This is 
because certain renewable energy technologies are or 
could be cost-effective compared to conventional technologies by 2030 as a result of technological learning 
and economies of scale.
Country cost-supply curves were developed from the 
perspective of government and business for the year 
2030. They were based on the substitution cost and the 
potential of each REmap Option.
In the government perspective, energy prices exclude 
taxes and subsidies, and a standard 10% discount rate is 
used. This allows for comparison of the costs and benefits across all REmap countries. This calculation shows 
the cost of doubling the global renewable energy share 
as governments would calculate it.
In the business perspective, the process was repeated 
using national energy prices including taxes and subsidies.9 A national cost of capital of 10% was used for 
Mexico. The use of these combined parameters serves 
to generate a national cost curve. This approach shows 
the cost of the transition as businesses and investors 
would calculate it.
Assessment of all additional costs related to complementary infrastructure, such as transmission lines, reserve power needs and energy storage or fuel stations, 
are excluded from this study. However, where relevant, 
8 1 GJ = 0.0238 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) = 278 kilowatt-hour 
(kWh) = 0.175 barrels of oil equivalent = 0.947 million British thermal units. In 2010, 1 USD was equivalent to 12.645 Mexican Pesos.
9 In the case of Mexico, all subsidies which exist today are assumed 
to be phased out by 2030.the implications of infrastructure needs on total system 
costs are discussed on the basis of a literature review.
Throughout this study, the renewable energy share is 
estimated relative to TFEC. Based on TFEC, the renewable energy share can be estimated for the total of all 
end-use sectors of Mexico or for each end-use sector 
(with or without the contribution of renewable electricity). The share of renewable power generation is also 
calculated. Further details of the REmap 2030 methodology can be found online in IRENA’s REmap webpage 
at: www.irena.org/remap.
This report also discusses the financing needs and 
avoided externalities related to increased renewable energy deployment. Three financial indicators are devised 
– the net incremental system costs, net incremental 
investment needs and subsidy needs. These indicators 
are briefly defined below:
1) Net incremental system costs: this is the sum of 
the differences between the total capital (in USD/
year) and operating expenditures (in USD/year) 
of all energy technologies. This is based on their 
deployment in REmap 2030 and the Reference 
Case for each year in 2010-2030.
2) Net incremental investment needs: this is the 
difference between the annual investment needs 
of all REmap Options and the investment needs 
of the conventional technologies being replaced. 
Investment needs for renewable energy capacity are estimated by calculating the total deployment of each technology in kilowatts (kW) 
or MW10 to deliver the same energy service as 
conventional capacity. This is multiplied by the 
investment costs (in USD/kW) for 2010-2030. 
This total is then annualised for the number of 
years covered in the analysis.
3) Subsidy needs: total subsidy requirements for 
renewables are the difference between the delivered energy service costs for the REmap Option 
(in USD/GJ final energy) and the delivered costs 
of its conventional counterpart. This is multiplied 
by its deployment in a given year (in PJ/year).
Externalities have been estimated related to GHG emission reductions as well as improvements in outdoor and 
indoor air pollution from the decreased use of fossil 
fuels. For each sector and energy carrier, GHG emissions 
10 1 GW = 1 000 MW = 1 000 000 kW = 1 000 000 000 watts. 
from fossil fuel combustion are estimated as a first step. 
For this purpose, the energy content of each type of 
fossil fuel was multiplied by its default emission factors 
based on lower heating values provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Eggleston 
et al, 2006). Emissions were estimated separately for 
the Reference Case and REmap 2030. The difference 
between the two estimates yields the total net GHG 
emissions reduction due to increased renewable energy 
use. To evaluate the external costs related to carbon 
emissions, a carbon price range of USD 20-80 per tonne 
CO2 is assumed (IPCC, 2007). This range was applied 
only to CO2 emissions and not to other GHG. According to IPCC (2007), the carbon price should reflect the 
social cost of mitigating one tonne of CO2 equivalent 
GHG emissions.
The external costs related to human health are estimated in a separate step, which excludes any effect related 
to GHG emissions. Outdoor air pollution is evaluated 
from the following sources:
1) outdoor emissions of SO2, NOx and PM2.511 from 
fossil fuel-based power plant operation,
2) outdoor emissions of NOx and PM2.5 from road 
vehicles.
To evaluate the external costs related to outdoor emission of SO2, NOx and PM2.5 from fossil power plant operation, the following parameters for respective pollutants 
were used:
a) emission factor (i.e. tonne per kilowatt-hour 
(kWh) for 2010 and 2030 taken from the 
International Institute for Applied Systems 
Analysis (IIASA) Greenhouse Gas and Air 
Pollution Interaction and Synergies (GAINS) 
database (ECLIPSE scenario (IIASA, 2014))
b) unit external costs i.e. Euro average/tonne

Mexico from the EU Clean Air for Europe 
11 PM emissions come in different sizes. Particles smaller than 10 micrometres can enter lungs, resulting in health problems. Particles 
smaller than 2.5 micrometres originate from various types of fossil 
fuel combustion, including power plants, stationary (e.g. steam 
boilers) and mobile (e.g. vehicles) emission sources. Emissions 
with particle size of 2.5-10 millimetres (PM10) originate also from 
crushing, grinding or dust that comes off the road as vehicles pass 
by. With the introduction of modern filtering systems, emissions of 
this size have been reduced. This study therefore focuses on emissions of particulate matter size of less than 2.5 millimetres. (CAFE) project (AEA Technology Environment, 2005). Potential differences in external 
effects between the EU and Mexico values are 
accounted for on the basis of the difference in 
gross domestic product (GDP) values12.

analysis can be found online13.
12 These factors are specific to the location. They include, for instance, climate and geographical conditions that contribute to the 
impacts of air pollution and are excluded from GDP. Furthermore, 
air pollution impacts may differ within a country, particularly in 
cases like Mexico, which cover a large territory. None of these differences and potential impacts was considered in this study. As a 
result, the externality estimates in this study can be considered 
conservative.
13 www.irena.org/remap.The following section discusses the energy situation in 
Mexico at aggregate level. It also provides a brief overview of the latest renewable energy developments and 
capacity additions.
3.1 Recent trends in renewables 
and in Mexico’s total energy 
system
Mexico produces fossil fuels. It is the world’s tenth 
largest oil and natural gas producer. Given that oil 
and gas production has a major impact on Mexico’s 
economic wellbeing, the commitment to developing 
renewable energy sources is especially noteworthy. 
According to the National Energy Balance 2013, TFEC for 
2013 was about 4.9 EJ, 90% of which consisted of fossil 
fuels. The total share of renewable energy, including 
electricity, was 8.9% of TFEC. Biomass comprises over 
70% of this total, or around 318 PJ, of which 255 PJ is 
traditional use of biomass from firewood and other 
forestry residues (SENER, 2014b). If traditional use of 
biomass is excluded, the share of modern renewable 
energy falls to 3.8%.
Power sector
At the end of 2013, the national power system largely 
relied on natural gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine 
(CCGT) plants. Fossil fuel power generation capacity 
dominates the system with some 72% (46,234 MW) of 
total installed capacity. Yet renewable power already 
has a respectable capacity share of 22% (14 177 MW). 
In 2013, this included hydropower (82.1% or around 
11.6 GW), wind (11.6% or 1.6 GW), geothermal (5.8% or 
823 MW), biogas (0.3% or 44 MW) and solar PV (0.3% 
or 40 MW) (see Table 1).
Total installed small hydropower (SHP) capacity 
(<30 MW) is 453 MW, of which 354 MW corresponds to 
plants with installed capacity of up to 10 MW. The Federal Electricity Commission (Comisión Federal de Elec3 RECENT TRENDS
KEY POINTS
● The share of total renewable energy in Mexico 
was 8.9% (or around 440 PJ) of TFEC in 2013. 
Nearly 60% of this was traditional use of biomass (255 PJ). Mexico still has major potential 
to deploy renewable energy in its transport and 
other end-use sectors.
● Renewable energy accounted for 22% of installed capacity in the power system in 2013 
(14 GW).
● The transport sector is the largest energy enduser in Mexico, accounting for half of Mexico’s 
TFEC in 2010.
● Water heating and space cooling are the applications with the greatest energy consumption 
in Mexico’s buildings sector.
● Within the next decade, the Mexican government aims to provide electricity to the 40-50% 
of rural communities that lack power access 
today.
● Mexico is the world’s tenth largest crude oil and 
natural gas producer, but natural gas imports 
for power generation are increasing.
● The US accounted for nearly 60% of Mexico’s 
total electricity exports in 2013 via 11 interconnections. Mexico’s electricity exports represent 
3% of its total consumption.
● Energy subsidies have been an integral part of 
Mexico’s energy system to support various sectors of the economy. As in other oil-producing 
countries, this provides the general population 
with a share in the wealth from national oil and 
gas production. The energy reforms aim inter 
alia to reduce market distortions and improve 
energy efficiency in part by reducing subsidies.Figure 2: Total final energy consumption in Mexico, breakdown by energy carrier, 2013

still has major potential to deploy renewable energy in its transport and other end-use 
sectors.

Renewable power generation in 2013 provided 42 213 
GWh out of a 296 343 GWh total, a share of 14.2%14. 
Renewable electricity was produced primarily from hydropower (77.6% of the renewable share), followed by 
geothermal (11.2%), wind power (10.6%), biogas (0.5%) 
and solar PV (0.2%) (see Table 2).
The recent development of renewables in electricity 
generation began in late 2008 when Mexico’s government enacted the Law for the Use of Renewable 
Energies and the Financing for the Energy Transition 
(Ley para el Aprovechamiento de las Energías Renovables y el Financiamiento de la Transición Energética, 
LAERFTE). Its objective was to regulate the use of re14 Renewable energy share in power generation in 2013 is lower than

than power generation from renewables. 
newable energy sources and clean technologies15 generating electricity not meant for public service (i.e., selfsupply outside the CFE grid). Since then, private sector 
interest in developing renewable energy has increased, 
as indicated by the rise in applications for renewable 
energy generation permits. This is shown in Figure 316.
Renewable power deployment for self-supply is economically appealing in many cases. This accounted 
for around 11.5% of total electricity generated from 
15 According to the Electricity Industry Law (August 2014), clean 
energy includes energy sources and power generation processes 
for which emissions or residues are below a predefined threshold 
set by national regulation. Besides renewable energy sources, the 
term clean energy mainly includes power generated using hydrogen, nuclear power, efficient CHP and thermal power stations with 
carbon capture and storage (SEGOB, 2014a).
16 There is no guarantee that this capacity will be deployed. This 
is due to the uncertainties related to the transition as the sector 
goes through the energy reform coupled with the lack of economic 
profitability for many projects under the previous legislative framework. For instance, as of September 2014, there were approximately 1.2 GW of permits issued for solar PV projects under small 
producer generation scheme (CRE, 2014) representing almost 
98% of total planned capacity for PV technology. In many cases, 
the economic compensation they would receive (linked to Costos 
totales de corto plazo (CTCP)) is simply not attractive enough.

Note: Total installed generation capacity for renewables excludes distributed generation of 29.2 MW in 2013. Solar PV installations accounted 
for 90% of total distributed generation.
In addition to CFE, the table provides four other categories in Mexico which depend on power generating electricity for national consumption 
prior to the energy reform. They are listed below:
1) Independent Power Producers (IPPs), are limited to contracting bilaterally with CFE to match its energy supply needs.
2) Self-suppliers, which generate electricity for their own consumption – typically industries and large commercial consumers.
3) Small Producers (<30 MW) allowed to sell renewable electricity to CFE at a fixed rate of 98% of the total short-term cost at the point of 
connection (equivalent to a nodal price);
4) CHP plants.
Under this regulatory framework, CFE was the single buyer for the electricity generated by IPPs according to its energy supply needs. When a 
renewable energy producer was seeking a large customer other than CFE for its electricity, the only possibility was through the legal constitution of a civil self-supply trade association.
Under the new legislation, these four specific types of generation will no longer be available. Other production and consumption schemes 
will be in place as the new energy market opens up to competition. This also means that the conditions and benefits that were applicable 
for private renewable energy generators under these modalities will be modified. In some cases they will be ended. See section 5 for further 
details on the reform.
Renewable energy accounted for 22% of installed capacity in the power system in 2013

2). The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE)17 of certain 
distributed generation technologies was already lower 
than the average electricity tariffs for residential and 
large industrial consumers in 2010 at around USD 0.09/
kWh. For commercial consumers LCOE was around USD 
0.20/kWh according to a study published by the InterAmerican Development Bank (2011) (Gischler & Janson, 
2011). However, deployment so far has been limited for 
various reasons. These include limited experience with 
renewables in the sector and the limited availability of

suitable financing or incentives to improve profitability, 
especially for plants not yet cost-competitive.
High solar irradiation levels mean small-scale distributed 
solar PV can provide energy bill savings for commercial 
sector consumers and for residential users subject to 
the DAC tariff18. These two types of customers now pay 
USD 0.2-0.28/kWh (CFE, 2014). Deployment of this application has been further supported by the introduction 
of a net-metering scheme in 2007, which has until now 
been administered by CFE. Around 1 600 consumers

The renewable energy power generation share in 2013 was 13.8%.were participating by end 2012 (IEA-PVPS, 2013). The 
early deployment of solar PV for self-supply started in 
off-grid installations for rural electrification (Wehner et 
al., 2010). This then spread to urban rooftops and now 
appears to be particularly promising in the commercial 
sector (Bloomberg Finance, 2013). As of 2013, small and 
medium scale distributed PV accounted for around 40% 
of the total PV installed capacity (or some 20 MW and 
7 MW respectively).
Many existing projects have been developed using project financing, a scheme used by most IPPs to minimize 
costs and reallocate investor risks. Project developers 
owning such projects have undertaken power purchase agreement (PPA) contracts under the self-supply 
scheme with large well-established companies that 
benefit from high credit ratings. This facilitates access 
and thus far has lowered the cost of financing for wind 
power generation. Such contracts also tend to be designed to limit project investor liability.
End-use sectors
Transport
The transport sector is the largest energy user in Mexico, 
with the highest expected growth rate in energy use. 
Utilizing the opportunities to reduce the transport sector’s growing energy demand will play a key role in 
determining Mexico’s future total energy consumption.
Most energy demand in the sector is for road transport, 
and most of this is based on petroleum products. The 
promulgation of standardised regulations for fuel efficiency for road transportation has helped make a good 
start in reducing demand. The two major options for renewable energy are biofuels substitution for petroleum 
products and electric vehicles (EVs) instead of internal 
combustion engines. To date the major focus in Mexico 
is on biofuels. The Bioenergy Law (Ley de Promoción y 
Desarrollo de los Bioenergéticos, LPDB) was published 
in February 2008 as part of Mexico’s low carbon strateFigure 3: Evolution and short-term perspective of installed renewables capacity by private generator,

(See Section 5 of the energy reform for further details.) They include completed as well as those planned plants (taking into consideration a 
potential average delay of one to two years from plant authorisation). Large hydropower is excluded from the figure.

for the production, storage, transportation and marketing of biofuels such as anhydrous ethanol or biodiesel. 
However, actual biofuels deployment has been limited 
by market size and structure: for example, a high standard grade of diesel/biodiesel needs to be developed and 
introduced.19
Today ethanol production in Mexico is derived from four 
main crops: sugar cane, grain sorghum, sweet sorghum 
and sugar beet. Of these crops, sugar cane is the only 
one with a production surplus. Grain sorghum is the 
cereal with the most productive potential for ethanol 
production, and sweet sorghum could have the highest 
yield of litres per hectare. Nevertheless it is not a commercial crop. Biofuel production from corn is banned 
due to a policy assuring the protection and primacy of 
food production.
The production of biodiesel was supported in 2007-2011 
through economic incentives granted for cultivating oil 
palm and jatropha curcas. Four biodiesel pilot plants 
were built. As a result, 49 200 litres of biodiesel were 
produced from oil plant plantations in 2010 and almost 
60 000 litres in 2011. The support for jatropha curcas 
was intended to result in 2.4 million litres of annual 
production, but this has not yet materialised (SEGOB, 
2014b).
The current production capacity of bioenergy (ethanol 
and biodiesel) in Mexico is shown in Table 3.
19 To date, there are no standardised quality regulations for diesel 
fuel. The market is too small to justify the cost of the upgrades 
needed to meet tougher standards. In addition, there are no fuel 
efficiency standards or emission controls for heavy trucks. 
There is a growing interest in developing a more sustainable automotive market including market incentives 
and adequate infrastructure for introducing hybrid and 
electric vehicles. Since Mexico has a rapidly growing 
motor vehicles manufacturing and export industry, it is 
well placed to design, produce and introduce EVs in the 
domestic market.
Heating/cooling sector
In 2012, total installed solar water heater capacity in 
Mexico was 1.5 GW (over 2 million square metres (m2)). 
More than 40% of the total installed capacity was flat 
plate collectors. Unglazed collectors (582 MW) and 
evacuated tube collectors (228 MW) accounted for the 
rest (Mauthner & Weiss, 2014). About 40% of solar water heaters were used for swimming pool heating (0.8 
million m2 installed capacity in Mexico City) with the 
remaining 60% for domestic hot water production. The 
market for solar water heaters is growing fast at a rate of 
about 11% per year. This trend is also in progress in other 
Latin American countries such as Brazil or Chile.
An IEA preliminary assessment in its Solar Heat for Industrial Processes database on concentrated solar heating shows 32 countries have introduced concentrated 
solar thermal technology in some 139 projects (AEE 
INTEC, 2014). Mexico contains six such heat generating facilities built with parabolic trough-collectors with 
a total of 600 kW of installed capacity. This is roughly 
equivalent to a collector area of 600 m2 (AEE INTEC, 
2014). These projects are at present supplying process 
heat for the manufacture of dairy products.
Direct use of geothermal for heating has been largely 
overlooked in the buildings and industry sectors, as 
opposed to its use for power generation. Direct geoTable 3: Ethanol and biodiesel production and storage capacity

550 PJ (or 156 MW) scattered across 19 states in about 
165 sites. These sites produced some 2.6 PJ of heat in 
2010 mainly for recreational purposes such as baths or 
spas (Figure 4) (IEA-GIA, 2013) (GEA, 2013). However, 
many locations in Mexico have major potential for use 
beyond the current focus.
3.2 Base year energy status
Sectoral breakdown
The base year chosen for all the REmap analysis presented here is 2010. According to Mexico’s 2010 national 
energy balance, TFEC was 4 610 PJ (see Table 4). This 
was only 0.4% higher than in 2009, when TFEC was 
4 59020.
Petroleum products (including condensates) accounted 
for two thirds of TFEC in Mexico in 2010. Natural gas accounts for another quarter. Modernised forms of renewable energy in national TFEC (excluding international 
aviation and including electricity consumption from 
renewables) represented 4.4% or 200 PJ. This share 
goes up to almost 10% if traditional biomass use is considered. Three quarters of the modern renewable energy proportion is related to renewable electricity consumption. One quarter is biomass use for process heat 
generation in the industry sector, biofuels (800 million

litres of ethanol); and for solar water heaters in buildings 
(1 078 MW installed capacity).
Transportation was the largest component of TFEC, 
followed by the industry and buildings sectors. The sectoral breakdown is changing. In the early 1990s, industry 
and transport sector had similar shares at around 35-
40% of TFEC. Since then, transport sector demand has 
almost doubled. Today the transport sector accounts for 
about half of Mexico’s TFEC while demand for energy in 
industry remains roughly the same. Over the same period the buildings sector’s total energy demand grew by 
about 35% but still accounts for about the same 20-25% 
of Mexico’s TFEC (SENER, 2012a).
In the transport sector, energy statistics on automotive 
transport include the energy consumed by transportation for people and freight. Air transportation considers 
the fuels used by domestic and international flights 
without including the purchases that any airline makes 
abroad. Railways include the consumption made by 
the different train concessions. Marine transportation 
includes domestic fuels sales to the merchant marine, 
the army, fishing companies and vessels in general. 
Electric transport takes into account the total amount 
of electricity consumed by public transport.

1 Data excludes international aviation (IEA, 2013).In 2010, fuel consumption in the transport sector was 
2 245 PJ (excluding international aviation). The breakdown by transport mode is as follows: automotive 
2 070 PJ; air transport 1 PJ for domestic flights (113 PJ 
for international aviation); maritime 30 PJ; railways 27 PJ 
and electric transport 4 PJ.
In 2010, industry’s total demand was almost 1.3 EJ. The 
largest industrial users of energy are steel, cement, petrochemicals, mining and chemicals production. Such 
bulk materials producers account for nearly 40% of 
Mexico’s industrial TFEC. These sectors require a great 
deal of heat at high temperatures. This creates obstacles 
to fossil fuel substitution in these sectors by renewables. 
Even using biomass, delivering process heat beyond 
medium temperature conditions (400 degrees Celsius) 
is difficult.
The remainder of Mexico’s industrial energy demand is 
related to the production of food, glass, paper and to 
the processes of other small industries. These plants 
generally experience low and medium temperature 
heat demand (often in the form of steam). This creates 
a great potential for Mexico to transform its industrial 
energy mix to renewables.
Figure 6 shows the energy utilisation by source (coal 
and coking coal, sugar bagasse, oil products, gas, electricity and solar) in each of the main industry subsectors. Oil and natural gas are the main sources of energy 
to meet industrial demand. Electricity also has a sizeable 
share (for fans, pumping, compressors etc.). Biomass is 
the main type of renewable energy consumed in the industry sector. It takes the form of bagasse, a by-product 
of the sugar industry. Bagasse was mainly consumed 
for power generation by the industry sector for its own 
consumption (SENER, 2013b).
Energy consumption in buildings is divided into residential, commercial and public. According to the national energy balance of Mexico, the residential sector 
accounted for 17% of Mexico’s TFEC. The commercial 
sector accounted for nearly 3% and the public sector 
less than 1% in 2010. There is data available related to the 
use of different energy carriers (e.g., coal, solar thermal) 
in Mexico’s buildings sector. On the other hand, data 
availability for energy use by type of application and 
other statistics is limited. Thermal energy use is mainly 
for cooking and water heating. In 2008, water heating 
accounted for about half total energy demand in the 
residential sector, and about two thirds of total buildings 
thermal energy demand. Space heating accounts for a 
lower share of total thermal energy demand in buildings 
(about 1% in 2008). This is similar to other countries in 
the region (SENER & IEA, 2011).
Total demand for electricity in the buildings sector is 
around 70 TWh (255 PJ). Economic growth and rising

Source: National Energy Balance 2010, SENERliving standards result in an increasing share of electricity in the country’s total buildings sector energy mix. This 
is due to various uses of household appliances as well as 
space cooling.21 In 2010, electricity accounted for around 
20% of the buildings sector’s total energy demand. Average per capita power demand in the residential sector 
was 420 kWh per capita per year.22 This masks significant differences. More than 20% of Mexico’s population 
live in rural areas, where those with access to electricity 
consumes on average 250 kWh power per capita per 
year. The rest of Mexico’s population lives in urban areas and consumes on average 470 kWh electricity per 
capita per year.
Wood and sugar cane bagasse (by households and industry, respectively) are the basis for thermal biomass 
applications in the end-use sectors. Households are the 
main users of wood fuel for cooking and heating, especially in rural areas. These are concentrated in central 
and southern Mexico. Firewood used for cooking and 
21 According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, 
Mexico had 28 million households in 2010 with an average of 3.9 
occupants per household (INEGI, 2014).
22 Calculated for the residential sector, considering 49.4 TWh of electricity consumption (SENER, 2012a), 30.3 million electricity users in 
households (SENER, 2015) and a national average of 3.9 persons 
per household (INEGI, 2014). 
heating accounts for the vast majority of the biomass 
consumption. In relative terms this represents one third 
of Mexico’s buildings sector energy use (260 PJ of the 
sector’s 747 PJ TFEC in 2010). The use of wood fuel 
has created pressure on Mexico’s forests. Like agricultural expansion and cattle breeding, it contributes to 
deforestation (Islas, Manzini, & Masera, 2006). Forests 
in Mexico today cover around 64.3 million hectares. Annual deforestation, however, is slowing down. It dropped 
from 0.52% per year in 1990-2000 to 0.3% per year 
in 2000-10. Mexico today leads in reducing emissions 
related to deforestation, and in increasing afforestation. 
This is achieved through a scheme providing financial 
incentives to prevent deforestation in priority zones 
(Höhne et al., 2012).
Apart from wood, small amounts of charcoal are used to 
fuel inefficient earth ovens (12-20% efficiency (REMBIO, 
2011)). Total consumption of charcoal was about 2.5 kilotonnes (kt) in 2012, representing 8 terajoules (TJ). Figure 
8 shows the geographical distribution of woodfuel users. Most demand is located in the southeastern central 
zone.
In the early 1990s, PV rural electrification projects were 
completed, and over 40 000 solar PV systems were installed. Most of these systems were in southern Mexico

Water heating in thermal uses and space cooling and refrigeration in electricity 
use are the applications with the greatest energy consumption in Mexico’s building 
sector(12 000 in the state of Chiapas). Most stalled after only a 
couple of years, and towards the late 1990s, the PV electrification programme stopped. Problems were mainly 
due to poor operational performance and poor quality 
installation. Mexico now has about 80 000 off-grid solar 
home systems (IRENA, 2013b).
In Mexico, less than three million people (about 675 000 
homes) live without access to electricity. These inhabitants are concentrated mainly in southern parts of 
Mexico. Poverty, distance from the existing grid, and 
the small size and dispersion of communities, all preclude efficient grid connection (World Bank, 2008). 
This represents an opportunity for further PV off-grid 
penetration.
There have been other uses of PV power, such as the 
installation of more than 1 700 solar PV pumping systems in 1994-2005 throughout Mexico with an average 
system size of 500 watts. These are to be found mainly 
in the northern deserts of the country that suffer from 
water shortages. They generate power for water pumping in agricultural applications, and replace traditional 
diesel/gasoline-engines. These systems are different 
than the solar home systems described above, which 
target household electrification. Other off-grid PV systems have also been built. One example is a commercial 
ice-making system installed in 1999 for use in fisheries in 
the remote desert community of Chorreras, Chihuahua. 
This is the first such system in the world. There are also 
a number of solar PV refrigeration systems, which were 
first used in Chihuahua and Quintana Roo in 2000 (Cota 
& Foster, 2010).
In addition to the existing solar home systems, around 
500 systems have been installed to date. They provide 
power to local communities and schools that previously 
lacked electricity access (around 3 000 people). This is 
in addition to solar water pumping systems also being 
deployed (IRENA, 2015a). By 2016, around 40-50 000 
rural families are scheduled to receive solar PV electricity. Within the next decade, the government plans to 
provide electricity to 40-50% of rural communities that 
lack access to electricity at the moment (Horn, 2011)
(Alliance for Rural Electrification, 2013). At least 8% of 
this will come from renewable energy (Crehueras, 2014).
Within the next decade, the Mexican 
government aims to provide electricity to the 
40-50% of rural communities that lack power

Mexico is the tenth largest producer of oil and natural 
gas in the world. Crude oil and its products represent 
45% of Mexico’s total primary energy supply. Mexico is 
also a net exporter of crude oil. In 2013, oil exports were 
2 737 PJ – 47.2% of total crude oil production. Major 
types of crude exported include Maya (83%), Isthmus 
(8.6%) and Olmeca (8.3%). Major export destinations 
include the US (75% of the total), Spain (15%), India (7%) 
and Canada (2%). Crude imports are marginal. However, 
in terms of oil products, Mexico is a net importer. It exports 15% of its total refinery output and imports 28% 
of its total oil product consumption. The net trade balance for primary energy – largely influenced by world 
oil prices – was around 2 529 PJ in 2013, 7.9% below the 
2012 level.23 The average price of Mexican crude in that 
year was USD 98.5 per barrel – 3.3% below 201224.
Mexico also produces coal and natural gas, but in smaller 
volumes. In 2013, Mexico imported 217 PJ of coal. Of the 
total imports in 2013, 48.5% came from Australia, 41.5% 
from the US, 3.8% from South Africa and the remaining 
6.2% from other countries.
23 Oil production in Mexico has steadily decreased since 2005 and 
reached its lowest level in 2013; production continued to decline in 
2014 (EIA, 2014). 
24 The potential effects of the changing oil price since late 2014 on 
the cost-effectiveness of renewables in Mexico is discussed in more 
detailed in Section 7.

Source: Masera (2011)Demand for natural gas in 2013 was 6 678 million cubic 
feet25 per day. In 2002-12, the average growth in demand for natural gas was 4.2% per year. Nearly half is 
used for electricity generation and one third in petroleum refineries. Much of the rest is used for industrial 
process heat generation.
Mexico is the world’s tenth largest crude oil 
and natural gas producer, but natural gas 
imports for power generation are increasing.
Future demand for natural gas will be determined by 
developments in economic activity and fuel prices. 
Based on SENER projections, the final price of natural 
gas is expected to average USD 7 per million Btu by 
2030. Gas prices have now broken their historic tie to 
crude oil prices, and it is unlikely that they will return to 
that system. The development of transport and distribution infrastructure for natural gas is another important 
factor affecting future demand forecasts. It is estimated 
that average annual domestic demand for natural gas 
will grow by 3.6% from 6 678 million cubic feet per 
25 1 million cubic feet of natural gas (dry) = 1 027 000 British thermal 
units. 
day in 2012 to 11 425 million cubic feet per day in 2027 
(SENER, 2013d).
Domestic natural gas production is finding it harder to 
meet its growing domestic demand. In 2013, natural gas 
imports equivalent to 993 PJ accounted for one third 
of Mexico’s gross domestic gas supply. Imports came 
mainly from the US (78%), and the rest from Peru, Qatar, 
Nigeria, Hungary, Yemen, and Trinidad and Tobago.
Transmission grids
Mexico has a largely interconnected transmission system. There are also two isolated systems, namely Baja 
California Norte and Baja California Sur. There are plans 
to connect these regions to the national grid by 2017 
(Baja California Norte) and 2018 (Baja California Sur).
A 400 kilovolt (kV) transmission line 103 kilometres long 
linking Mexico to Guatemala started commercial operation in 2010. It allows energy transfers to the Central 
American Electrical Interconnection System countries. 
This increases the reliability of electric supply and promotes investments in new electricity generating plants 
to serve the regional electric market. It has an initial export capacity of 200 MW and an import capacity of 70

with the US, all in Texas and California. Their capacities 
are 36-800 MW. In 2013, 7.4 TWh of electricity was exported, creating a net export of 5.7 TWh. Of the exports, 
4.3 TWh (58%) went to the US, 1.6 TWh to Belize (21%) 
and 1.5 TWh to Guatemala (21%).
The US accounted for nearly 60% of Mexico’s 
total electricity exports in 2013 via 11 
interconnections. Mexico’s total electricity 
exports represent 3% of its total consumption.
To meet expected demand growth, national stateowned electric company CFE has identified necessary 
transmission capacity improvements that will permit 
the deployment of new renewable energy projects. 
The energy reform so far has set up the framework and 
guidelines for energy planning (see Section 5 for further 
details) to be carried out in future by SENER and by the 
National Centre for Energy Control (Centro Nacional 
de Control de Energía, CENACE). According to SENER, 
future investment needs for system enhancement (i.e.,
excluding self-generation and off-grid installations) 
amount to USD 164.4 billion for 2014-28. Approximately 
56% of this is for power generation, 21% for distribution, 
12% for transmission and 11% for maintenance (SENER, 
2013a).
Before the energy reform, the most significant mechanism in Mexico geared to developing transmission for 
renewable power generation was the “temporada abierta” or open season. This served to reserve transmission capacity for renewable generation connection. 
The scheme, coordinated by the Regulatory Energy 
Commission (Comisión Reguladora de Energía, CRE), 
enables the development of transmission infrastructure. 
The aim was to meet the needs of CFE and of private 
developers under the self-supply generation scheme 
beyond plans in existence at the time. This allowed both 
grid reinforcement and expansion.
In broader terms, the open season has allowed private 
generators to reserve transmission capacity by committing to cover transmission costs. These costs are 
paid proportionally by each participant according to 
the reserved capacity. The reserved capacity is determined through a complex process, in which developers 
provided credit guarantees of a specific share of their

Note: One thousand cubic feet (MCF) is equivalent to one million BTU (MMBTU), or approximately 1 055 GJcosts at a final stage. In this way, CRE ensured that all 
the participants expressing interest to the transmission 
capacity are able to meet the associated costs.
The first open season process started in 2006 to allow 
the deployment of wind in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec 
in the state of Oaxaca. This first initiative resulted in a 
plant with 2.6 GW of wind capacity (with an 40% average capacity factor) as well as the requisite supporting 
transmission capacity. This was equivalent to a total 
investment of USD 4.5 billion, including generation and 
transmission capacity (CRE, 2012).
CENACE coordinates the operation of the national 
power system to ensure economic dispatch, safe operation and reliability of the system. CENACE is now 
designated as independent system operator (ISO) (see 
Section 5 for further details). The system is divided into 
six interconnected regions, which permit the coordination of regional supply, demand and capacity reserves 
across Mexico’s three different time zones. This enables 
a more efficient and reliable system operation to deal 
with a range of operational situations. As noted above, 
the Baja California peninsula regions are an isolated part 
of the national system (Figure 9).
Energy subsidies
Mexico has subsidies in place for the vast majority of 
domestic and agricultural electricity consumption, and 
regulated retail prices for gasoline, diesel and LPG. This 
sometimes includes a subsidy.
In the power sector, there is a complex electricity tariff 
structure with different rates depending on consumption level and type of user. The tariffs applicable to the 
agriculture and residential sectors include subsidies 
(except for the DAC tariff19). Residential subsidies are 
calculated as a function of consumption based on 
temperature zones. Consumers in regions with higher 
temperatures have higher subsidised consumption. Industrial, commercial and DAC tariffs are not subsidised, 
and they tend to cover total electricity supply costs. In 
some cases rates are even higher than costs, implying 
the application of cross-subsidies.
As of June 2014, the average subsidy in the residential 
and agricultural sectors amounted to 60% and around 
74% of total generation costs respectively (CFE, 2015). 
For commercial and industrial consumers, average prices were 8% above the costs of the energy service they

Source: CFEreceive (CFE, 2015). The average weighted subsidy for 
all consumers in the system represented 22% of total 
generation costs including cross-subsidies (CFE, 2015).
Retail prices for gasoline, diesel and LPG are regulated 
and set on a monthly basis. The existence of a subsidy 
is determined by comparing the national regulated price 
to an average international reference price. Gulf Coast 
prices are used for gasoline and diesel (SENER, 2013e), 
and Mont Belvieu for LPG (Monrroy, 2012)). So if the 
national price is higher, there is no subsidy but if the 
national price is lower than the international price, the 
amount of the subsidy per unit is equivalent to the difference between the reference price and the regulated 
one.
As the energy reform aims to liberalise national energy 
markets,26 there are plans to eliminate all producer and

consumer subsidies in principle, except for those that 
apply to low-income consumers. A first step in this direction is the deregulation of retail prices for gasoline, 
diesel and LPG. This is due to be effective within the 
next couple of years.
Energy subsidies have been an integral 
part of Mexico’s energy system to 
support various sectors of the economy. 
As in other oil-producing countries, this 
provides the general population with a 
share in the wealth from national oil and 
gas production. The energy reforms aim 
inter alia to reduce market distortions 
and improve energy efficiency in part by 
reducing subsidies.The REmap analysis begins with a Reference Case. 
This is an assessment of energy consumption projections and the uptake of renewable energy technology 
in 2010-2030 in Mexico based on current policies. The 
base year is 2010. This section describes the Reference 
Case and how it was derived.
Detailed projections by the Mexican government on 
final energy supply and demand up to 2027 are available. They cover the power sector, the development 
of solar thermal energy use in buildings and biofuels 
in transport for 2026 and 2027. These projections in 
the Reference Case are based on data from two different series of annual reports. These are entitled “Power 
Sector Perspectives” (Prospectiva del Sector Eléctrico)
and ‘Renewable Energy Perspectives’ (Prospectiva de 
Energías Renovables). Reference Case projections for 
end-use sector demand were based on the businessas-usual scenario in the APEC Energy Demand Supply 
Outlook (APEC, 2013b). This contains energy predictions to 2020 and 2030.
Adding these projections together produces an estimated TFEC of 7.4 EJ by 2030. This is a 64% increase over 
2010. Almost 45% of TFEC will be in the transport sector 
in 2030, a slightly smaller relative share than in 2010. 
Industry in 2030 accounts for 33% of demand, four percentage points higher than in 2010. The buildings sector 
demand share remains almost unchanged at 20% of 
TFEC in 2030. Oil products and electricity continue to 
be the energy carriers showing the greatest demand in 
2030, followed by natural gas and renewables.

Renewable energy share in TFEC 
Industry Buildings Transport Power Total
The buildings sector experiences the largest growth in renewable energy use in 2010-2030 
in the Reference Case.The share of modern renewable energy in Mexico’s 
TFEC will increase from 4.4% in 2010 to 10% by 2030 
in the Reference Case (see Figure 12). Total modern renewable energy consumption in absolute terms grows 
almost fourfold by 2030, mostly in the power sector. Renewable electricity generation will grow by 140% from 
48 TWh/year in 2010 to 116 TWh/year in 2030. Total 
power generation is expected to grow at a similar rate 
from 260 TWh/year in 2010 to 602 TWh/year in 2030. 
Despite the significant increase in renewable power 
generation, the renewable energy share in power generation remains almost unchanged from 18.5% in 2010 to 
19.3% in 2030 (see Figure 12). This is because electricity 
demand increases at the same rate.
Note that there is a peak in the share of renewable 
electricity in 2020. This comes from SENER projections 
which forecast accelerated growth for renewable power 
in this first period and slower growth in 2020-2030.
SENER and APEC projections show the share 
of modern renewable energy in Mexico’s 
energy mix will reach 10% by 2030, up from 
4.4% in 2010.
The Reference Case distinguishes energy use by consuming sector, technology and application. It also distinguishes between modernised and traditional renewable 
energy. The highest demand for modern renewable 
energy in 2030 will be in the buildings sector – 285 PJ 
in end-use applications and approximately 105 PJ from 
renewable electricity consumption. The total (390 PJ) 
represents 27% of total sector energy demand, up from 
only 5.6% in 2010. More than half of modern renewables included in TFEC (215 PJ) will be accounted for by 
bioenergy for heat applications. These are used mainly 
for cooking purposes. This is driven by the replacement 
of traditional use of biomass for cooking with efficient 
cook stoves (Islas, Manzini, & Masera, 2006). A major 
increase in the use of solar thermal energy for water 
heating is expected, amounting to approximately 70 PJ 
in 2030.
Renewable energy in transport included in TFEC will 
amount to about 75 PJ in 2030. This is mostly liquid biofuels, and is a 350% increase over 2010 when the figure 
stood at around 17 PJ.
Renewable energy in industry has an 11% share of total 
sector demand (280 PJ) in 2030, compared to 10% 
(125 PJ) in 2010. Most of the increase is due to greater 
use of renewable electricity. Total final use for heat 
generation remains unchanged, an increase in the use 
of solar thermal roughly balancing out a decrease in the 
use of biomass. The latter is partly associated with improvements in energy efficiency in industrial processes 
(APEC, 2013b).

Solar PV Geothermal
Power generation (TWh/year) 
2010 2020 2030The forecasts show electricity generation from 
renewable sources amounts to around 115 TWh/
year in 2030, an overall increase of 140% over 2010 
(Figure 13). Of this, hydroelectricity accounts for 
52  TWh, wind (the preferred technology for new 
power projects) 38 TWh, solar PV 13 TWh, geothermal 
9 TWh and biomass 3 TWh. The contributions of other 
technologies such as biogas and CSP are fairly small 
at around 140 GWh and only 15 GWh respectively. 
Over the same time period, power generation based 
on natural gas will grow from 120 TWh in 2010 to 400 
TWh in 2030. Coal-fired power generation rises from 
36 TWh to 54 TWh and nuclear power generation 
increases from 6 TWh to 26 TWh.
For other renewable energy end-use applications 
(Figure 14) the Reference Case further differentiates use 
by technology. For 2030, it shows no change in bioenergy use for heat production (including traditional use 
of biomass). This remains at around 290 PJ/year, some 
90% of which is in the residential sector. This somewhat 
masks a significant shift from traditional to modern 
forms of biomass in the residential sector. However, 
there still remains around 50 PJ of traditional biomass 
use in 2030. In transport, liquid biofuels use increases 
from 17 PJ to 75 PJ (equivalent to 3.5 billion litres of 
ethanol in 2030).
In the buildings sector, solar thermal heat use increases 
from only around 5 PJ in 2010 to 70 PJ in 2030. The 
growth in renewables is significant, but these numbers 
remain modest when compared to the amount of fossil 
fuels used. This amounts to 590 PJ in 2030.
By 2030, non-electricity use of oil products in all enduse sectors (excluding agriculture) will increase from 
2 630 PJ to 4 075 PJ,27 and non-electricity use of natural 
gas omit will increase from 529 PJ to 800 PJ.
27 Energy consumption from oil products in the agriculture sector 
was 145 PJ in 2010 and is projected to be 142 PJ in 2030. No renewable energy option was identified for this sector in the rest of this 
analysis.

KEY POINTS
● Planning and control of the national power 
system, power transmission and distribution, 
and petroleum and other hydrocarbon exploration and extraction remain strategic areas 
whose functions are performed exclusively by 
the state. However, Mexico’s government may 
now nonetheless enter into contracts with private firms or persons to carry out these responsibilities. This includes extending, modernizing, 
financing and/or operating the power transmission and distribution networks.
● According to the Electricity Industry Law (LIE 
by its Spanish acronym), all the participants in 
the newly created power market will compete 
under equal circumstances for generation and 
wholesale market activities. The exception is 
nuclear power generation, the domain of CFE.
● The new energy legislation creates a wholesale 
electricity market, enabling the establishment 
of electricity suppliers that can freely negotiate 
power supply contracts and tariffs.
● CENACE becomes the ISO managing the transmission and distribution system in coordination 
with SENER and CRE. CENACE coordinates the 
wholesale electricity market, with the responsibility to meet electricity demand at lowest cost 
while guaranteeing the stability of the network.
● No specific framework for the development of 
geothermal energy by private players existed 
prior to the energy sector reform. The Geothermal Energy Act now regulates the survey, exploration, development and exploitation stages 
of geothermal resources for both power and 
heat generation in line with international best 
practice.
● Targets to generate a share of total electricity 
from clean energy technologies have been set 
at 35% by 2024, 40% by 2035 and 50% by 2050.
● The Bioenergy Interministerial Commission (Comisión Intersecretarial de Bioenergéticos) has 
been created to analyse and dictate the guidelines for public policy in bioenergy.
● The Bioenergy Law outlines regulations for 
activities related to biomass, and seeks to contribute to energy diversification and advance 
sustainable development.
The following section discusses the current renewable 
energy policy framework. It is important to bear in mind 
that Mexico has centralised policies that are constitutionally mandatory.
5.1 Energy sector reform
Mexico has recently reformed its energy sector substantially in order to increase the country’s productivity. The 
purpose of two major reforms is to increase investments 
and jobs and grant PEMEX and CFE more freedom to 
modernise and work as productive enterprises.
For the oil and gas sectors, the reform aims to foster 
greater output at more efficient cost, and to foster 
competitive conditions in refining, transportation and 
storage activities. It does so by allowing private companies to participate under state regulation. The reform 
seeks to modernise the power sector, promote lowest 
reasonable costs of electricity, and deploy cleaner technologies.
In order to achieve these goals, it was necessary to modify certain constitutional articles that limited the potential 
for competition in the oil and power markets. Specifically, 
the constitutional reform decreed the following:The reforms also created a public trust called the Mexican Fund of Petroleum for Stabilisation and Development. This is to be maintained by the state with the 
Central Bank (Banco de México) as trustee institution. 
Its purpose will be to receive, administer and distribute 
income derived from assignments and contracts indicated in Article 27.
Several secondary laws were recently enacted as a 
result of these constitutional reforms and the energy reform subsequently adopted in December 2013. Through 
the Chamber of Deputies and Senate, Congress created 
or modified 21 laws grouped in nine areas (Table 7). A 
last piece of secondary legislation, the Energy Transition 
Law, is still going through the legislative process and 
should be enacted soon. This law would establish a new 
legal framework for sustainable energy development 
and for regulating power sector objectives for clean 
energy production and emissions reduction (Mexico 
Chamber of Deputies, 2014). Among others, it replaces 
the current law regulating renewable energy.29 30
29 However, since this law is still not enacted, the renewable energy 
policy will be described in this report as mandated by current 
legislation, including the current law regulating renewable energy. 
But it should be noted that this is likely to be modified in the near 
future.
30 When this study was completed in January 2015, some other 
regulatory measures were not yet published, such as power market 
rules and the provisions for clean energy certificates. 
● Reform of Article 27: the nation will still own the 
petroleum and solid, liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons in the subsoil. In this respect no concessions 
will be granted.
● In order to generate income for the state to 
support long-term national development, it 
will carry out the exploration and extraction of 
hydrocarbons by assigning these activities to 
its productive enterprises (all previously stateowned companies). Alternatively, it can arrange 
contracts with these or with private companies. 
’State productive enterprises’28 may themselves 
contract with private entities. These contracts 
had not been possible in Mexico since the 1938 
oil expropriation.
● Reform of Article 28: planning and control of 
the national power system, the public service 
of electricity transmission and distribution, and 
petroleum and other hydrocarbon exploration 
and extraction now form part of the strategic 
areas whose functions are performed exclusively 
by the state. However, the state can now make 
contracts with private persons.
28 A state productive enterprise is defined as the exclusive property 
of the federal government, with its own legal personality and heritage. Furthermore, it is provided with technical, operational and 
managerial autonomy. This newest term is unique for PEMEX and 
CFE, both enterprises within the energy sector.

Note: New regulatory framework including legislative acts passed as of December 2014Planning and control of the national power 
system, power transmission and distribution, 
and petroleum and other hydrocarbon 
exploration and extraction remain strategic 
areas whose functions are performed 
exclusively by the state. Mexico’s government 
may now enter into contracts with private 
firms to carry out these responsibilities 
including extending, modernizing, financing 
and/or operating the power transmission and 
distribution networks.
The main provisions from the recently enacted laws 
relevant to the development of renewable energy and 
mainly concerning the power sector are now described 
in detail. These are the Electricity Industry Law, the creation of an ISO for the power sector and the Geothermal 
Energy Law.
Electricity Industry Law
The Electricity Industry Law was promulgated on 11 
August 2014 to open power sector generation and the 
wholesale market to competition. The law establishes 
a new regulatory framework for Mexico´s electricity 
sector, keeping the planning and control of the national 
power system as strategic duties of the state. The transmission and distribution of electricity will also be run 
by the state through the state- owned CFE (SEGOB, 
2014a). However, private entities are now allowed to 
sign a range of different contracts with the state. This 
potentially contributes technology, financing and expertise to the expansion and improvement of the transmission and distribution networks.
The provisions of the Electricity Industry Law do not 
particularly refer to renewable energy but rather all 
forms of clean energy. This includes technologies other 
than renewables. It establishes a Clean Energy Certificate (CEC) market to foster investments in clean energy 
and encourage retirement of the less efficient power 
plants. This is described more fully below.
According to the Electricity Industry Law 
all the participants in the newly created 
power market will compete under equal 
circumstances for generation and wholesale 
market activities. The exception is nuclear 
power generation, the domain of CFE.
Under the Electricity Industry Law, all generators are 
guaranteed the right to compete in the wholesale 
market and to have open access to the grid. They can 
sign contracts and sell their electricity in the wholesale 
electricity market. The Electricity Industry Law affirms 
that the state keeps exclusive authority over nuclear 
generation through CFE, but all the participants in the 
newly created power market will compete under equal 
circumstances for generation and wholesale market 
activities.
New energy legislation creates a 
wholesale electricity market, enabling the 
establishment of electricity suppliers that 
can freely negotiate power supply contracts 
and tariffs.
The new law distinguishes two kinds of electricity users 
according to their level of consumption: qualified and 
basic users. Qualified users are able to purchase energy 
in the wholesale electricity market or directly from CFE 
or other suppliers at previously and freely negotiated 
rates. Basic supply users will purchase power from CFE 
at regulated tariffs established by CRE.
The law also permits certain retailers to buy and sell 
energy in the wholesale electricity market at prices 
negotiated freely between generators, retailers and 
qualified users. CFE will buy energy through auctions so 
it can meet its power needs at competitive prices. In this 
new scheme, suppliers can offer innovative prices and 
services to compete for customers, but the Electricity 
Industry Law does impose low-carbon objectives for the 
power sector. This takes the form of renewable energy 
quota obligations for qualified users and retail suppliers to acquire CECs. CRE will regulate transmission and 
distribution rates and corresponding subsidies to supply 
basic users.
Independent System Operator
The Electricity Industry Law appoints CENACE as the 
ISO. It will function as a decentralised public entity 
under federal public administration, with its own legal

the operation of the national electricity system in terms 
of efficiency, reliability, continuity and safety. It has the 
responsibility to meet electricity demand at lowest 
reasonable cost while guaranteeing the stability of the

CENACE becomes the ISO managing the 
transmission and distribution system 
in coordination with SENER and CRE. It 
coordinates the wholesale electricity market, 
with the responsibility to meet electricity 
demand at lowest cost while guaranteeing 
the stability of the network.
Market mechanism to promote renewables in 
the power sector: Clean Energy Certificates
The Electricity Industry Law creates a clean energy 
quota obligation scheme to encourage renewable and 
other clean energy uptake in the power sector. Its purpose is to assure a growing share of total demand for 
clean generation. It is similar to a tradable green certificate (or portfolio standard) scheme, but is broadened 
to grant certificates for clean generation as opposed 
to renewable energy alone. The characteristics of the 
scheme already defined at time of writing are summarised in Table 9.
The obliged parties must comply with a CEC quota. 
This will be determined as a desired proportion of clean 
energy power in total electricity consumed over a specified period at a particular load centre.
The CECs issued to clean generators may be traded by 
interested parties in bilateral transactions and are valid 
on condition that monitoring, reporting and verification requirements established by CRE are met (SEGOB, 
2014c). Sale agreements of this type are considered 
commercial acts. Specific trading rules are yet to be defined, as they will be tightly linked to the power market 
rules. It can be initially inferred that CECs will be traded 
in the power market either as part of a power purchase 
agreement or as a separate commodity.
The CEC scheme entails the use of clean energy. When 
fossil fuels are used in conjunction with it, the ‘clean 
generators’ are entitled to receive a CEC for the share of 
generation accounted for by clean energy. This scenario 
is primarily relevant to CHP. For these purposes, the 
proportion of clean energy free from fossil fuel will be

Eligible technologies
All the clean energy sources as defined by the Electricity Industry Law. Clean 
generators shall be entitled to receive a CEC for each unit of power they generate without the use of fossil fuels. For efficient cogeneration generators, they 
will receive a given number of CECs according to the methodology defined 
by CRE for clean energy accountability for this type of technology. A CEC has 
permanent validity until it is cancelled to comply with a quota obligation.
Enforcement
Some economic penalty is considered to be in place to enforce compliance. 
Nevertheless, penalties for non-compliance were still to be determined by the 
CRE at time of writing.

of geothermal energy by private players 
existed prior to the energy sector reform. 
The Geothermal Energy Act now regulates 
the survey, exploration, development and 
exploitation stages of geothermal resources 
for both power and heat generation.
5.2 Renewable energy law
The recent evolution of renewable energy policy in 
Mexico was driven by the Law for the Use of Renewable Energies and Financing the Energy Transition. 
This was published on 28 November 2008. Its goal was 
to encourage the use of renewable energy and clean 
technologies for electricity generation.32 It incorporated 
a mandatory policy document known as the National 
Strategy for Energy Transition and Sustainable Energy 
Use. This included a discussion of acceptable instruments to finance the energy transition.
The Law for the Use of Renewable Energies and Financing the Energy Transition was adopted to comply with 
signed international agreements on GHG emissions reduction33 and clean energy power generation goals. The 
2011 amendment to the law established a set of nonfossil fuel generation goals for 2024, 2035 and 2050.34 35
The law was meant to define and regulate the use of 
renewable energy mainly for power generation. It man32 Clean energy includes energy sources and power generation 
processes for which emissions or residues are below a predefined 
threshold set by national regulation. See footnote 15 for full definition.
33 Mexico has signed agreements for technical cooperation with 
a number countries including the US and Denmark, as well as 
international financial institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank. Mexico has also been supported by international 
cooperation agencies like USAID and the German Enterprise for 
International Cooperation (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit).
34 As mentioned above, new legislation to update the Law for the 
Use of Renewable Energies and Financing the Energy Transition 
following the energy reform is awaiting approval by the Mexican 
Congress. This could then be accompanied by the modification of 
these goals. 
35 These goals were also part of the mitigation measures to attain the 
objectives of the Climate Change Law (Ley General del Cambio 
Climático), whose objective is to cut emissions by 30% by 2020 
and by 50% by 2050 compared to 2000. Fulfilling these aspirational goals is subject to the availability of international financial 
and technology support mechanisms for developing countries 
(Congreso General de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, 2012).
determined for each power plant according to a methodology yet to be established by the CRE.
To prevent emissions reduction overestimation, any 
clean energy generating plant registered under the 
clean energy obligations scheme may not be registered 
under any other type of GHG emissions reduction 
scheme.
CRE will be in charge of certifying the clean energy fraction, issuing certificates, administering and monitoring 
the CEC scheme. Further detailed rules on how the CEC 
scheme will operate and how the quotas will be allocated are still to be defined by the CRE31.
Geothermal Energy Law
The Geothermal Energy Act regulates the survey, exploration, development and exploitation of geothermal 
resources for power and heat generation in accordance 
with international best practices. It was promulgated 
in line with the recent constitutional amendments. Its 
objective is to use energy contained in the subsurface 
of the national territory to generate electricity or other 
thermal uses (SEGOB, 2014a). Before these changes, 
there was no specific framework for geothermal development, as activities of this kind were constitutionally 
reserved for the state.
One of the main elements of the Geothermal Energy 
Act is the definition of hydrothermal geothermal fields 
in a way that differentiates them from conventional 
aquifers, thus allowing specialised regulation. The distinction made between geothermal water and water for 
human consumption is key in this respect. For additional 
aquifer protection, additions and reforms were made to 
the Water Act to establish closer coordination between 
the Ministry of Energy and the National Water Commission. The Geothermal Act establishes binding technical 
and hydrological requirements for the construction, 
discharge and environmental impact of geothermal 
activities. It grants permits for all such activities. Finally, 
it takes into account efficient measures to maintain the 
sustainability of the hydrothermal geothermic fields31.
31 In its 36th article, the Geothermal Energy Law establishes that geothermal water arising from the exercise of a test well for a permit 
or geothermal concession must be reinjected to the geothermal 
area. This maintains its sustainability in terms of the applicable 
provisions yet to be defined. dated SENER to develop a national renewable energy 
inventory to provide reliable information on renewable 
energy resources in Mexico. It established a set of instruments like the Special Program for the use of renewable 
energy, an energy transition strategy and an energy 
transition fund, all of which are described below:
● Special Program for the Use of Renewable 
Energy: this introduces specific objectives and 
goals for the use of renewable energy, as well as 
renewable energy inclusion goals in electricity 
generation. It defines the strategies and action 
needed to achieve these goals, as well as strategies to promote renewable energy projects to 
generate electricity for rural communities.
● National Inventory of Renewable Energy: this is 
a system of statistical and geographical services 
financed by the Fund for Energy Transition and 
Sustainable Use of Energy. It collects information 
on renewable energy potential and on electricity 
generation projects using renewable sources and 
makes the information publicly available. This 
information is provided through the Mexican Atlas of Biomass Resources for Power Generation, 
the first section of the National Wave Atlas, the 
National Atlas of Waves and Wind, the Atlas of 
Solar Radiation, the National Atlas of Geothermal 
Resources, and the National Atlas of Small Scale 
Hydropower Resources.36
● The National Atlas of Feasible Areas: this atlas 
provides geographical information needed to locate generation projects and resource potential. 
This should facilitate the decision-making processes for developing and authorizing renewable 
energy generation projects.
● Fund for the Energy Transition and Sustainable 
Energy Use: this fund´s objectives are to finance 
programmes and projects focused on four areas. 
The first is the use and application of technologies for the use of renewable and clean energy. 
36 Available at http://inere.energia.gob.mx/publica/version3.2/
The second is the promotion of energy efficiency 
and power savings in the different sectors (residential, industrial, commercial, agricultural). The 
third funding area is aimed at diversifying energy 
sources as needed for the energy transition in 
Mexico. Finally, it funds the collection, generation 
and dissemination of information about renewable and clean energy potential in Mexico. The 
fund also promotes power saving and the efficient use of energy in all kinds of processes and 
activities, from generation to end-use. The fund is 
formed by four ministries (Energy, Finance, Environment and Natural Resources, and Agriculture) 
alongside CFE and three research and development institutes. These are the National Council 
for Science and Technology, the Electric Power 
Research Institute and the Mexican Oil Institute. 
The resources allocated to the fund originate 
from the national budget, amounting to a total of 
more than USD 500 million in 2009-2014.
Targets to generate a share of total electricity 
from clean energy technologies have been 
set at 35% by 2024, 40% by 2035 and 50% 
by 2050.
Both the Law for the Use of Renewable Energies and 
Financing the Energy Transition and the provisions 
described above are still in force. However, they will 
be abrogated by the Energy Transition Law still going 
through the legislative process. It is therefore most likely 
that the mechanisms described above will be subject to 
modification.
5.3 Bioenergy legal framework
In February 2008, the Bioenergy Law was published 
in the Federal Official Gazette. This law states that 
activities related to bioenergy are considered to be 
in the national interest, contribute to comprehensive

Note: The percentage refers to the total power generation of the national power system. The law does not directly refer to renewables for 
power generation, in spite of the definition of clean energy.national development and help guarantee sustainable 
development of the rural sector. This legal framework is 
regulated by articles 25 and 27, fraction XX of the Mexican constitution. The Bioenergy Law contributes to the 
goals of energy diversification and sustainable development. It does so by promoting the production of inputs 
for biofuels and the production, commercialization and 
efficient use of the biofuels themselves.
The Bioenergy Law created the Bioenergy Interministerial Commission (Comisión Intersecretarial de Bioenergéticos), composed of the heads of relevant ministries 
with different interests in the matter. This commission 
designs and dictates guidelines for public policy related 
to bioenergy for further implementation by competent 
authorities.
The Bioenergy Interministerial Commission 
has been created to analyse and dictate the 
guidelines for public policy in bioenergy.
The regulatory framework established by the Bioenergy Law defines the requirements, procedures and 
periods for granting permits for the production, storage, 
transportation and commercialisation of bioenergy. It 
specifies the measures that must be followed to protect 
the environment during the industry’s development, 
and dictates sanctions for the different offences as 
stipulated in the legal framework. Failure to comply with 
permitting requirements may mean a permit is revoked. 
Guidelines defining the binding requirements for biofuel 
permits are shown in Table 9.
The Bioenergy Law outlines the regulation 
for activities related to biomass, and seeks 
to contribute to energy diversification and 
sustainable development.
Following the energy sector reform published in the 
Federal Official Gazette, nine related laws were enacted 
and 12 other laws were modified because they are linked 
directly or indirectly with bioenergy. The laws directly 
related to the bioenergy sector are the Coordinated 
Energy Regulators Act, creating CRE, and the National 
Agency of Industrial Safety and Environmental Protection for the Hydrocarbon Sector Act. This created a new 
agency, the National Agency for Industrial Safety and 
Environmental Protection of the Hydrocarbons Sector. 
This is better known as the Agency for Safety, Energy 
and Environment. This national agency is an administrative body separate from the Environment and Natural 
Resources Ministry. It is authorised to regulate and 
supervise the production, transportation, storage and 
industrial distribution of biofuels when they are directly 
related to diesel and/or gasoline mixing or preparation processes. SENER is specifically authorised by the 
Bioenergy Law to grant and revoke permits related to 
production, storage, commercialisation, transportation 
and biofuels distribution through pipelines (the latter in 
conjunction with CRE).

Source: SENER 
Note: This table is based on the sixth of a number of guidelines for the grant of permits for producing, storing, transporting and commercialising bioenergy such as ethanol anhydrous and biodiesel. This is directly related to the permit of production and storage of bioenergy.
* According to the Bioenergy Law, exception notices are given when the maximum production capacity of any given plant reaches 500 litres, 
and maximum storage reaches 1 000 litres.Table 10 provides an overview of the possible capacity 
of certain renewable energy technologies for power 
generation. The table separately indicates the probable
capacity for geothermal and small hydropower (SENER, 
2014a).
If probable capacity is considered, both geothermal and 
small hydropower (< 30 MW) offer a major resource opportunity. According to the journal Hydropower & Dams, 
the theoretical potential for hydropower in Mexico is 
49 GW. However, the economic potential is estimated 
at about half that at 27 GW based on today’s capacity 
factor as calculated from a total generation potential of 
72 TWh/yr. This economic potential is more than twice 
the installed capacity in 2013. Thus another 15 GW could 
be utilised. In Mexico today hydropower capacity of at 
least 3.8 GW is planned (SENER, 2013a). In addition to 
the values shown in Table 10, the estimated tidal energy 
potential in the Gulf of California amounts to 26 GW 
(SENER, 2012c).
The estimated bioenergy supply potential in Table 11 for 
2030 is based on a study (REMBIO, 2011) prepared by 
REMBIO and IRENA estimates (IRENA, 2014b). According to IRENA, Mexico’s total sustainable biomass supply 
potential (only including residues and excluding cultivated biomass) through to 2030 is 626-1 012 PJ/year. 
The REMBIO estimate of 3 569 PJ is much higher – 1 063-
1 515 PJ/year. This is because it also includes 1 063 PJ of 
energy crops and 1 515 PJ of forest products in addition 
to residues. According to REMBIO estimates, forests 
present the highest bioenergy potential. Dedicated 
energy crops based on food crops are not considered 
in the IRENA analysis in view of the competition with 
land and increasing food demand in Mexico to 2030. 
Given Mexico’s efforts to reduce deforestation, only the 
residue and waste streams of the forest products are 
accounted for in the IRENA analysis.
The supply cost of biomass depends on the resource 
type, where the resource is located, where it is delivered 
and in which form it is transported. According to IRENA 
estimates, biomass supply costs for Mexico (including 
transportation costs of USD 2-3/GJ) range from USD 
2.4/GJ for processing residues and biogas to around 
USD 4.6/GJ for harvesting residues. Wood residues and 
waste are estimated to cost around USD 3.3/GJ in 2030. 
However, given the size of the country and resource

Note: The methodology used to determine this potential follows a similar approach to that employed to assess hydrocarbon reserves. Therefore 
probable capacity is not a share of possible reserves. Instead, the potential is cumulative. It does not include the potential for which generation 
permits have been granted nor resource already being exploited. It is estimated as follows:
● Possible capacity refers to theoretical potential for power generation based on indirect studies and generic assumptions that do not state 
any technical or economic feasibility.
● Probable capacity denotes sites where some field studies have been carried out, but are not sufficient to prove technical and economic 
viability.
6 RENEWABLE POTENTIALS AND COSTSdistribution, transportation costs may be higher in reality than the assumed average value for the 26 countries 
analysed in REmap.
The potential of sustainable wood supply is distributed 
throughout the country. It is more concentrated in the 
peninsular area in the South and in the Sierra Madre 
Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental mountain ranges 
in north-eastern and western Mexico (see Figure 15). 
These biomass resources are thus convenient to most 
areas of demand.
According to REMBIO, dedicated energy crops are the 
second largest source of biomass after wood. These 
include eucalyptus, sugar cane, sugar beet, sweet sorghum, palm oil and jatropha curcas – all resources highly 
suitable for biofuels production. Figure 16 shows the 
distribution of dedicated energy crops in Mexico.

1 The difference between the low and high supply potential from IRENA estimates is due to different assumptions of factors such as development in non-disturbed area allowed or not, land recovery rates, proportion of residues from food consumption; land development rate, etc.

KEY POINTS
● There is high quality wind resource potential for 
up to 30 GW of onshore wind in 2030 with an 
average capacity factor of 35%.
● Given Mexico’s major solar resource potential, 
installed solar PV capacity could rise from 5 GW 
in the Reference Case to 30 GW in 2030 under 
REmap 2030. This consists of 60% utility-scale 
and 40% rooftop installations.
● Compared to the Reference Case, significant solar thermal potential is available for further deployment, especially in industry, which benefits 
from an additional 45 PJ under REmap Options.
● In REmap 2030, total biomass use would be 
three times as high as in 2010. Biomass in TFEC 
would account for more than half total renewable energy use.
● Heating applications account for half total biomass demand in Mexico in 2030, with the other 
half related to transport and power generation.
● Compared to very limited use today, a quarter 
of Mexico’s total heating sector energy demand 
could be supplied from modern renewables.
● Options have been identified that can triple 
Mexico’s total final renewable energy use from 
around 0.5 EJ in 2010 to 1.5 EJ by 2030.
● Implementing REmap Options provides the opportunity to reduce Mexico’s total coal demand 
by 62%, natural gas by 21% and oil by 6% in 
2030 compared to the Reference Case. This 
means natural gas demand would grow by 115% 
between now and 2030. Under Reference Case, 
this demand rises by 175%.
● Installed solar PV and wind capacity account 
for 74% of the REmap Options identified in the 
power sector.
● Mexico could be on track to meet its clean 
energy objectives i.e 35% of power from clean 
technologies by 2024 and 40% by 2035.
● The major renewable energy potential for heating can be realised and result in savings at the 
same time given the availability of low-priced 
biomass residues and waste, and cost-competitive solar water heaters.
● Compared to equivalent new capacity using 
conventional generation, accelerating Mexico’s 
uptake of renewable energy could result in savings of USD 0.1/GJ (USD 0.4/MWh) using the 
business perspective. It could result in savings 
of USD 2.0/GJ (USD 7.2/MWh) using the government perspective.
● Onshore wind, utility-scale solar PV and geothermal would be cost-competitive with natural 
gas power plants in 2030. However, this will 
depend on the trajectory of natural gas prices.
● REmap Options would reduce Mexico’s CO2
emission growth between 2010 and 2030, from 
70% to 40%, or to 513 Mt CO2 emissions instead 
of 615 Mt CO2 in 2030.
● A 21% renewables share results in annual net 
savings of USD 1.6 billion in Mexico’s total energy system by 2030. If savings from improved 
human health from reduced air pollution and 
lower CO2 emissions are also taken into account, 
they amount to USD 4.6-11.6 billion annually.
● Adequate long-term planning for grid development is critical to meet the wind and solar 
power generation potential under REmap 2030.
● If Mexico fulfils its distributed electricity and 
heating generation potential, 22% of the 38 
million homes predicted for 2030 would have 
solar water heating systems and 10% solar PV 
rooftops by 2030.
● Biomass supply potential needs to be fulfilled 
and a biomass market created to connect supply and demand in order to obtain the 810 PJ 
of primary biomass estimated under REmap 
Options for 2030.
● Adequate long-term planning for grid development is essential to meet the wind and solar 
power generation potential under REmap 2030.The REmap analysis for Mexico uses a REmap tool 
developed internally. This incorporates forecasts from 
two sources, namely SENER for power sector and APEC 
Energy Demand Supply Outlook 2013 business-as-usual 
scenario (APEC, 2013b) for the Mexican end-use sectors. The REmap analysis allows for commodity and 
fuel prices specific to particular countries, as well as 
localised renewable and conventional technology costs 
and performance characteristics. The data, assumptions and approach used have been summarised in 
Sections 2 and 4. The tool allows IRENA to enter additional renewable energy options in the industry, buildings and transport end-use sectors as well as power 
generation and district heat. However, the latter was 
excluded from the scope of the present analysis as there 
is no district heating in Mexico.
The procedure for using the tool to create REmap Options is as follows:
1) A Reference Case was created for 2020 and 
2030. For 2010-2030, it was based on the business-as-usual scenario in the APEC Energy Demand Supply Outlook 2013 for Mexican end-use 
sectors, as well as projections from SENER for the 
power sector.
2) Fuel prices were forecasted based on SENER national reports (for fuels other than biomass) and 
IRENA estimates (for biomass).
3) Local technology cost and performance criteria 
(e.g., capital costs and capacity factors) were 
based on SENER reports and IRENA’s own estimates.
4) Additional renewable energy options for all enduse sectors and the power sector were analysed 
and entered into the tool as appropriate.
The following studies have been used to identify additional renewable energy options beyond the Reference 
Case:
● Renewable Energy Perspectives 2012-2027 (SENER, 2013b) and CONUEE study for the promotion 
of solar water heaters in Mexico (CONUEE, 2007). 
These were used to set the potential for additional solar water heating in a high penetration 
scenario in the buildings sector.
● National Energy Strategy 2013-2027 (SENER, 
2013c) was used to assess the economic potential of wind, geothermal and solar PV power by 
2020.
● Power Sector Perspectives 2013-2027 (SENER, 
2013a) was used for additional wind developments by 2027 according to the alternative (high 
renewable development) scenario. This aims for 
a 35% power generation share using clean technologies by 2024.
● National Renewable Energy Inventory (SENER, 
2014a) was used to assess the technical potential of solar, wind, geothermal power and small 
hydropower.
● Hydropower & Dams, World Atlas 2014 (Hydropower & Dams, 2014) to establish the economic 
potential of hydropower.
● Biomass supply potential and cost estimates 
originate from IRENA for power and heat generation and biofuel production (IRENA, 2014b)
(IRENA, 2013a).
● Bioenergy in Mexico, Current Status and Perspectives (REMBIO, 2011) was the reference for 
biomass supply potential.
● The IRENA Renewables for Industry Roadmap 
(IRENA, 2014c) was used for total heat generation and solar and geothermal heat generation 
in Industry.
The following section is divided into five subsections. 
Section 7.1 discusses the potential of different renewable 
energy technologies in Mexico, as well as the regions 
with greatest renewable resource availability. Section 7.2 
provides a survey of the REmap Options. In Section 7.3, 
detailed cost projections are provided, while Section 7.4 
presents cost/supply curves for the REmap 2030 energy mix. Section 7.5 discusses these findings, challenges 
and alternative cases.
7.1 Renewable energy 
technologies in 2030
Mexico has significant and diverse renewable energy 
resource potential (see Section 6). The National Energy Strategy 2013-2027 (SENER, 2013c) outlines the 
economic potential of renewable energy for the power 
sector that could be realised by 2020. Figure 17 shows 
the current status of renewable energy deployed and 
planned as of June 2014.The potential, distribution and characteristics of each 
renewable resource available for power, heat and biofuels production are described in the following paragraphs on specific technologies.
Wind
Onshore wind potential in Mexico is located mainly in 
three regions: the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (southern 
region), the states of Tamaulipas (eastern region) and 
Baja California (northwestern zone). According to 
INER, the total theoretical wind potential amounts to 
50 GW (SENER, 2014a), while the economic potential 
by 2020 amounts to 20 GW, as shown in Figure 17
(SENER, 2013c). The resource available in some zones 
with high potential, like the Isthmus of Tehuantepec 
in Oaxaca, is estimated to be capable of producing at 
a capacity factor of more than 40%. Of the total 50 
GW theoretical capacity, 20 GW of potential capacity 
could be deployed with an average capacity factor of 
35%. Another 10 GW could be deployed at an average 
capacity factor of 27%. The remaining 20 GW could 
be deployed with a 20% average capacity factor 
(PWC, Climate Works Fundation, IMERE and WWF, 
2013).
As shown in Figure 18, wind projects are being deployed 
in locations with high wind resource potential. The Reference Case assumes the continuation of this trend to 
2030 with 11 GW onshore wind capacity, where plants 
with capacity factors of 40% are being deployed. An additional 19 GW capacity is assumed under REmap 2030. 
This option is derived from the alternative scenario 
in the Power Sector Perspective 2013-2027 (SENER, 
2013a), which increases onshore wind power capacity penetration to around 30 GW by 2030. About half 
the total capacity in REmap 2030 is assumed to be 
deployed in low wind resource areas averaging a capacity factor of about 27% with the other half in areas 
averaging a capacity factor of 35%. This represents 60% 
of Mexico’s total theoretical wind potential of 50 GW as 
outlined in Section 6 of this report.
REmap 2030 also assumes 1 GW offshore wind is deployed in the Gulf of Mexico.
Solar PV/CSP
Mexico’s geographical location is ideal for the exploitation of solar resources. The daily average solar irradiation stands at 5.5 kWh/m2.

Note: Planned capacity is based on the proven potential according to INERE data (SENER, 2014b), which corresponds to power capacity 
from generation permits approved for renewable energy projects. There is no guarantee that the projects related to such planning would 
ultimately be deployed.The solar PV resource potential is shown in Figure 19 
with specific sites identified where solar developments 
could be economically feasible. Northwestern Mexico 
shows major potential for solar power generation. Daily 
average irradiation in the region can exceed 8 kWh/
m2 in spring and summer (SENER, 2014a). Levels in 
the region are similar to southwestern US, where many 
utility-scale solar power plants are being built today. The 
central region also has abundant solar resource, as does 
the Baja California peninsula.
To date, solar resources in Mexico are barely exploited 
on any large-scale or commercial basis. The Reference 
Case considered an increase in solar PV capacity of only 
5.6 GW by 2030, of which around 60% is utility-scale 
and the remaining is rooftop solar. This represents an 
annual growth of 300 MW in 2010-30, already much 
higher than the annual installations of 31 MW in 2013 and 
17 MW by September 2014 (CRE, 2014)37.
37 The low deployment of solar PV observed that year may have been 
influenced by the series of regulatory changes initiated in Mexico.
The REmap Options include an addition of almost 
25 GW of solar PV capacity, assuming the same share of 
60% utility-scale and 40% residential/commercial applications as in the Reference Case. Total solar PV capacity 
reaches 30 GW in REmap 2030. This capacity is assumed to be deployed to a large extent in northwestern 
Mexico which is distant from the most populated areas 
in Mexico. Demand is in the centre and the southern 
parts of the country. This distance between supply and 
demand means planning will be needed for transmission infrastructure in coordination with solutions for grid 
integration of renewables.
REmap also adds 285 MW solar PV rural electrification 
systems to the Reference Case to arrive at a total of 
860 MW. Some of these systems provide electricity to 
households without access to grid power. Other systems 
are mini-grids used to provide power for street lighting, 
agricultural pumping, mobile phone towers etc. in addition to residential needs.
Solar resources for CSP power generation are abundant. 
However, as yet no sizable additions of this technology

with an average capacity factor of 35%.are included in the Reference Case. By contrast, REmap 
took into account an increase of 1.5 GW in CSP capacity.
Given Mexico’s major solar resource 
potential, installed solar PV capacity could 
rise from 5 GW in the Reference Case to 30 
GW under REmap 2030. This consists of 60% 
utility-scale and 40% rooftop installations.
Geothermal
Geothermal energy is also a major potential resource 
for both electricity and heating projects. Mexico has 
the fifth largest installed geothermal power capacity 
after the US, the Philippines, Indonesia and New Zealand (IRENA, 2015c). Although it is expected that new 
projects will go on-stream in the near future, some units 
are also due to be decommissioned (GEA, 2013). Thus 
a substantial net increase in capacity requires greater 
effort. Considering the probable capacity alone means 
neglecting a considerable amount of untapped geothermal energy for both electricity and heat generation, as 
described in Section 6. The resource potential is spread 
throughout the country, but concentrated in the central, 
eastern and southern regions, as shown in Figure 20.
The REmap Options assume 3.2 GW in geothermal 
electricity generation capacity in addition to the 1.1 GW 
accumulated installed capacity envisaged in the Reference Case. In REmap 2030, total geothermal capacity 
reaches 4.3 GW.
Mexico’s Electric Power Research Institute estimated 
probable reserves of geothermal high-enthalpy reservoirs suitable for power generation at a minimum of 
3.3 GW (Birkle, 2006). To achieve REmap 2030, all of 
this would have to be utilised.
Biomass
The REmap Options for 2030 for power generation from 
bioenergy amount to 2.8 GW, an addition of almost 
1 GW to the Reference Case. Approximately 1 GW of this 
increase corresponds to biomass co-firing in coal plants 
and 1.8 GW of CHP located on site at industrial plants. 
Biomass use at industrial CHP plants is halved between 
bagasse and a range of solid biomass sources. The total 
installed capacity in REmap 2030 is similar to the economic potential for the year 2020.

Off-grid and distributed power is the most extensively 
explored energy solution for most of Mexico’s isolated 
communities. Small hydropower shows significant untapped potential for this segment.
Hydroelectricity in Mexico is expected to continue to 
grow both from large hydropower facilities and small, 
mini and micro hydro projects (<30 MW) under construction or planned. An additional 6.5 GW is anticipated for large hydropower, based on the economic 
potential presented in the report Hydropower and Dams 
(Hydropower & Dams, 2014). The estimated potential 
for small hydropower lies mainly on the rivers of the 
Pacific Rim and in the states of Veracruz, Oaxaca and 
Chiapas (SENER, 2014a). Mexico has a gross estimate of 
3.2 GW in small hydropower potential (up to 10 MW)38. 
However, much of the economic potential has been 
already developed or is in the pipeline. REmap 2030 
therefore retains the 1.8 GW of total installed capacity 
from the Reference Case in 2030.
38 This value is based on inferences from international statistics and 
not on a resource assessment.
In the Reference Case, around 17 GW of large hydropower and 1.8 GW of small hydropower are considered. Total 
installed capacity reaches 25.3 GW in REmap 2030.
Potential in end-use sectors
Solar and geothermal use for heating and cooling, and 
modernised forms of biomass in end-use sectors all offer further potential.
For process heat generation, 80% of total solar thermal 
REmap Options (10 GW) is to be found in the manufacturing industry. It serves 5% of total energy demand for 
industrial process heat generation (IRENA, 2014c). Two 
thirds of this potential would mainly be deployed in sectors with low temperature heat demand, such as food 
and textile production processes, as well as in certain 
chemical production processes. The rest is mainly for 
medium temperature applications for chemical production processes using solar thermal concentration 
technologies. Mexico has recently started to deploy 
this technology, with some 600 kW of thermal capacity in operation. This is used mainly in the food sector 
(AEE INTEC, 2014).
Potential for solar cooling in industrial applications is 
estimated as 23 MW. This would provide about 2-3%

Note: Scale corresponds to subsoil temperature in °C.of power demand in food production, replacing power 
demand for refrigeration (IRENA, 2014c).
The remaining additions for heat concern solar water 
heating in buildings. Water heating energy demand accounts for 10% of buildings total thermal energy use in 
Mexico in 2030. The Reference Case already considers 
a significant addition of solar thermal – around 17 GW 
from almost no use in 2010. A small addition of 1.5 GW 
is included in REmap 2030, based on an extrapolation 
of a high penetration scenario for solar water heating 
systems (SENER, 2013b). Around 90% of the buildings 
sector potential is in households, and the remaining 
10% in the service sector (SENER, 2012c). An addition 
of about 4 GW solar cooling can be a substitute for split 
air conditioning use. This would replace about 1% of 
total building electricity demand, or 5% of total electricity demand for cooling. Total solar thermal capacity in 
buildings thus amounts to more than 23 GW by 2030.
In total, solar thermal capacity estimated for both industry and buildings amounts to almost 33 GW in REmap 
2030. This would require around 2 GW of annual solar 
thermal capacity additions in 2010-2030, a level ten 
times higher than the annual additions in 2010-2012.
Compared to the Reference Case, significant 
solar thermal potential is available for further 
deployment, especially in industry, which 
benefits from an additional 45 PJ under 
REmap Options.
Low/middle temperature direct-use applications for 
generating heat for industry, buildings or agriculture 
offer a greater potential for expanded geothermal use 
than is the case for power generation. However, very 
little is happening at present in these promising applications. An addition of around 800 MW of geothermal 
heat for the industry sector is considered under REmap 
Options (about 1% of Mexico’s total energy demand for 
process heat generation). This potential is realisable because a major part of deployable geothermal resources 
for direct heating are close to manufacturing facilities 
in Mexico.
Several forms of biomass could be used in Mexico, including wood and wood products, agricultural and forest residues, and biogas from urban waste and manure. 
The largest additional biomass use in 2030 takes place 
in the transport sector in the form of liquid biofuels 
and in the manufacturing sector for process steam and 
power generation. These amount to 53 PJ and 175 PJ, 
respectively, beyond the Reference Case. Within manufacturing, 29 PJ would be in cement manufacturing. The 
biomass and waste component of this industry’s fuel 
would rise by 20%. Combined with other measures, this 
would put Mexico’s cement industry on a path to reducing its clinker production emissions by 45% compared 
to 2010 (IEA, 2009). One third of the remaining 146 PJ is 
related to steam generation in boilers and two thirds to 
CHP for various production processes.
Fuel blending in the transport sector in both gasoline 
and diesel was taken into account for REmap Options. 
This assumes a 6% ethanol blend in gasoline, equivalent 
to 86 PJ consumed per year in REmap 2030 versus 
53 PJ in the Reference Case. A 5% biodiesel blend was 
assumed39 for diesel. This is equivalent to 41 PJ/year 
in REmap compared to 22 PJ in the Reference Case. A 
30% blend of biokerosene in jet fuel for air transport 
was assumed for domestic aviation only. However, the 
definition of local transport varies greatly among different sources and needs to be improved. As a result of 
these REmap Options, total primary biomass demand 
in the transport and industry sectors reaches 257 PJ and 
200 PJ, respectively in 2030.
REmap 2030 also replaces fossil fuels through transport 
sector electrification. It includes a fleet of over 350 000 
plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and around 
60 000 two-wheel EVs. This results in new electricity demand of 1.5 TWh (assumed to be sourced from 
renewable energy) and raises the sector’s electricity 
demand by 40% compared to the 2030 Reference Case. 
It replaces almost 9 PJ in oil products in 2030 based on 
a 1% market penetration of the total motorcycle and 
passenger vehicle stock estimated in 2030 (World Bank, 
2009)40.
All traditional use of biomass remaining in the buildings 
sector in the Reference Case is replaced by modern 
types of bioenergy. In total, 15 PJ of modern bioenergy 
replaces 51 PJ of traditional biomass use. Around 4 PJ of 
this potential is biogas and the remainder is solid bio39 The earlier 1% blend targeted for biodiesel has already been 
achieved in the Reference Case and was therefore revised. 
40 Total road vehicle stock is predicted to reach over 70 million units 
in 2030, of which 50% are sedan cars and almost 10% are motorcycles.mass. This adds another 590 000 modern cook stoves 
to over 7 million considered in the Reference Case.
The total supply potential for biogas is about 300 PJ. 
This mainly takes the form of urban waste across the 
country, and manure in the northern and central western 
regions. In the Reference Case, biogas use reaches 60 PJ 
in 2030 in the buildings and industry sectors. In REmap 
Options, an additional 4 PJ is assumed for cooking, and 
about another 20 PJ for process heat generation. This 
amounts to a deployment of around one third of the 
total biogas supply potential.
Total biomass demand in end-use sectors as liquid biofuels and for heating/cooking reaches 810 PJ in REmap 
2030. This is almost halfway between IRENA minimum 
and maximum estimates of total supply potential discussed above.
In REmap 2030, total biomass use would be 
three times as high as in 2010. Biomass in 
TFEC would account for more than half total 
renewable energy use.
Biomass is used as a source for power, transport fuels 
and heat technologies, therefore providing energy services in all sectors. Figure 21 shows the distribution of 
primary energy between end-use and power sectors. 
The transport sector accounts for almost a third of total 
demand followed by the buildings sector. Industry is 
projected to consume about a quarter of total biomass 
usage and the remaining is for power generation.
7.2 Roadmap table
REmap 2030 results in a significant increase in the 
amount of renewable energy use in TFEC. In 2010 
around 200 PJ of modern renewable energy was used 
in Mexico (about 460 PJ including traditional use of 
biomass). In the Reference Case for 2030, about 748 PJ 
originates from modern renewable energy, while REmap 
Options amount to almost 790 PJ. Biomass remains the 
largest source of renewable energy in REmap 2030. 
However, solar PV shows the largest increase both in absolute terms and in growth rate, with a fivefold increase 
in generation between the Reference Case to REmap 
2030. This is followed by wind, which almost doubles. 
Renewable energy in TFEC could nearly double to 1.5 EJ 
compared to the Reference Case (748 PJ). Figure 22 
shows the anticipated Remap 2030 increase for each 
renewable energy resource.

Heating applications account for half total biomass demand in Mexico in 2030, with the 
other half related to transport and power generation.Table 12 and Figure 23 show the estimated breakdown of 
renewable energy end-use by consuming sector for 2010 
and 2030 for both the Reference Case and REmap 2030.
Mexico’s heating sector shows considerable potential 
for renewables. The modern renewable energy share 
of the buildings sector has the largest potential for 
increase. It rises from about 6% in 2010 to 39% in 2030 
under REmap 2030 as a result of significant deployment 
of solar thermal and modernised cooking/heating appliances using biomass. In the case of biomass, geothermal and solar thermal, the industry can triple its share of 
renewable energy use in the same time period. By contrast, the transport sector experiences limited growth 
in renewable energy share with the implementation of 
REmap Options. Nevertheless, the renewable energy 
share it can achieve under REmap 2030 is significant 
compared to 2010. Given the sector’s total energy use

Compared to very limited use today, a quarter of Mexico’s total heating sector 
energy demand could be supplied from modern renewables.in Mexico’s TFEC, even low shares of renewable energy 
make a significant impact in the country’s total renewable energy use.
The share of renewable energy in the power sector 
more than doubles in REmap 2030 compared to the 
Reference Case and compared to 2010. It increases from 
just under 19% to almost 46%, or around 116 TWh and 
280 TWh of renewable power generation respectively.
All the above renewable energy developments mean 
the modern renewable energy share in TFEC reaches 
21% in REmap 2030 compared to 4.4% in 2010. This suggests Mexico could be in line to meet its clean energy 
objectives to obtain 35% of power from clean technologies by 2024 and 40% by 2035. Under REmap 2030, 
these targets can be achieved with renewables alone.
Renewable power represents 54% of total renewable 
energy used in Mexico in REmap 2030. The other 46% 
is related to end-use sector demand. Of this, around 
82% is for heating and cooling applications in industry 
and buildings, and 18% in transport biofuels. This differs 
from 2010, when heating applications represented two 
thirds of renewable energy use and renewable power 
just under one third.
Various forms of bioenergy in power and end-use sectors account for nearly 40% of the total renewable 
energy use in REmap 2030. This is followed by solar PV 
and solar thermal with 23% and wind with 18%. Solar 
PV accounts for about 60% of the total solar use. Solar 
thermal accounts for most of the rest, with CSP technology providing less than 1%. The remainder consists 
of 14% hydropower and 6% geothermal, virtually all of 
which is dedicated to power generation. The most obvious changes from 2010 include a decline in the share of 
traditional biomass to zero in 2030 from almost 60% 
in 2010. Meanwhile, the contributions of solar thermal, 
solar PV and wind energy rise significantly.
Figure 24 shows how REmap Options would change 
the primary41 energy fuel mix in 2030, with renewable 
energy replacing conventional energy sources. There 
are different ways to calculate the primary energy 
equivalent of renewables, resulting in a range of esti41 As shown in Figure 24, primary energy use estimates are based 
on TFEC and primary energy use in power generation, including 
energy derived from blast furnace and coke ovens. They exclude

oil and gas extraction.

Options have been identified that can triple Mexico’s total final renewable energy use from 
around 0.5 EJ in 2010 to 1.5 EJ by 2030.mates.42 The high renewable calculation uses the Energy 
Information Administration partial substitution method 
while the low calculation uses the IEA physical energy 
content method. These do not represent different cases 
or different levels of renewable energy consumption, 
but rather differences in converting renewable electricity and heat into primary equivalents.
In primary terms, renewable energy use in Remap 2030 
increases by 68-103% over the 2030 Reference Case. 
Coal demand falls most in relative terms by 62% (174 PJ) 
to remain the lowest fossil fuel contributor to Mexico’s 
primary energy mix. Natural gas – now the dominant 
fuel for power generation – sees the largest reduction in 
absolute terms (950 PJ), but only a 21% drop in relative 
share. This is because gas-fired generation is replaced 
by renewable power. Oil retains the largest share of primary energy (a little larger than natural gas) and sees 
42 Different methods are applied to estimate total primary energy 
demand. The two applied in this study are the physical energy 
content and substitution methods. The physical energy content 
method is used by IEA and Eurostat. These count renewable electricity and biofuels as primary energy at the same value as they 
appear in the form of secondary energy. Meanwhile, geothermal, 
CSP and nuclear are counted by converting average process efficiencies into primary energy equivalents. The substitution method 
converts renewable electricity and heat to primary energy. This 
method uses the average efficiency of the fossil fuel power and 
heat plants that would otherwise be required to produce these 
quantities. 
only a 6% reduction compared to its total consumption 
in the Reference Case in 2030. Renewables take third 
place as primary energy resource after oil and natural 
gas if renewable technologies and uses are aggregated 
under REmap 2030 as described above.
Table 13 provides more detail about the evolution of 
the energy system envisioned in this study. It shows 
the analysis base year 2010, the Reference Case for 
2030 and REmap 2030. The renewable energy share 
in TFEC grows from 4.4% in 2010 (200 PJ) to 10% in 
2030 (748  PJ) in the Reference Case. The renewable 
share more than doubles under REmap 2030, in which 
total renewable energy use is 1 536 PJ/yr by 2030. This 
consists of 128 PJ as liquid biofuels, 584 PJ as heat in 
buildings and industry, and 824 PJ as renewable power 
consumption.
Figure 25 provides an overview of capacity developments for the REmap Options in the power sector in 
2013 (the year with the most recent data available), the 
2030 Reference Case and REmap 2030. For each technology, there is a significant gap between the 2030 Reference Case and REmap 2030. This indicates that the 
level of potential renewables use is significantly higher 
than projected in current plans. Under Remap 2030, 
solar PV would have the largest renewable power generation capacity by 2030 and would require the largest

Implementing the REmap Options provides the opportunity to reduce Mexico’s total coal 
demand by 62%, natural gas by 21% and oil by 6% in 2030 compared to the Reference Case. 
This means natural gas demand would grow by 115% between now and 2030. Under the 
Reference Case, this demand rises by 175%.growth in capacity deployment to 2030. Onshore wind 
would rank second in installed capacity followed by 
hydropower.
With the addition of 163 TWh of renewable power generation in REmap Options, renewable power generation 
grows to 280 TWh by 2030, a 46% share of total generation. This is more than double the Reference Case. 
Annual renewable generation consists of 65 TWh in

installations (greater than 30 MW). Bioenergy options 
for power generation show a 11 TWh increase in addition to the 3.5 TWh in the Reference Case. Finally there 
is practically no use of CSP in the Reference Case, but 
CSP power generation amounts to almost 4 TWh in 
REmap 2030.
Total power generation in REmap 2030 includes a significant share from variable renewables (wind and solar) 
amounting to 26% – or 157 TWh per year. The challenges 
associated with intermittent power sources of these 
kinds are discussed in Section 7.4.
Mexico could be on track to meet its clean 
energy objectives i.e. 35% of power from 
clean technologies by 2024 and 40% by 2035.
7.3 Summary of REmap Options: 
cost-supply curves
Previous sections have discussed the technology options available for accelerated renewable energy development in Mexico by 2030. In this section these options 
are coupled with their respective technology costs and 
ranked in terms of cost-effectiveness. This aggregation 
represents an overall cost-supply curve of the achievable renewable energy deployment under REmap Options.
The REmap Options represent a portfolio of technologies considered applicable for accelerated renewable 
energy deployment in the power and end-use sectors 
(buildings, industry and transport). This is based primarily on technical factors and resource availability. This 
portfolio is not an allocation of the global additional 
potential based on Mexico’s GDP or on the experience 
of the other 25 REmap countries, nor does it represent 
extrapolations. Further technology portfolios can be

the parameters that constitute REmap Options or other 
studies looking at the specific case of Mexico.
The cost-supply curves discussed in this section are 
an approximate representation of the realistic economic potential of renewable energy technologies – the 
REmap Options – which can be deployed by 2030 in 
addition to the Reference Case. The cost-supply curve 
is not used a priori to develop the REmap 2030. Instead, 
it is an ex post representation of the REmap Options 
taken.
The results of the analysis are shown in the cost-supply

technology costs and technical performance characteristics (capacity factors, conversion efficiencies etc.) 
There are two sets of curves. One is based on national 
costs – the business perspective. It incorporates the national cost of capital using a 10% discount rate, energy 
commodity prices including national taxes,43 as well as 
subsidies. The second is the government perspective. 
This is based on standard international energy commodity prices. For coal and natural gas, a distinction is 
made between export and import countries. The government perspective uses a fixed 10% discount rate. The 
business perspective reflects factors likely to influence 
private investment decisions. The government perspective considers factors more relevant to government 
decisions on policy and spending. The national costsupply curves are used to examine the costs and savings related to increased renewable energy uptake. The 
standard international curve is used when considering 
research and development needs. It compares renew43 A carbon tax for fuels is included in these national parameters. It 
is equivalent to USD 0.007/litre for gasoline, USD 0.009/litre for 
diesel and USD 0.004-0.005 for natural gas.

able potential and costs across regions or globally and 
provides insight into cost differences between Mexico 
and global markets resulting from policy decisions like 
energy taxation.
Decision-makers will be tempted to pick low-cost options from the left end of the curve and to skip highcost options on the right side. However, the cost curves 
should not be misinterpreted as a series of steps from 
left to right showing costs in isolation that can be chosen or rejected. Rather, there are synergies and interactions, and all of these options need to be exercised 
together to achieve the indicated level of costs and 
renewable energy shares. The figure therefore gives a 
perspective of the entire country and energy mix.
Nor should decision-makers assume that options represented by individual blocks in the supply curve are 
homogenous in terms of substitution costs. Rather, the 
blocks represent average values based on the deployments assumed in the REmap 2030. For instance, some 
options produce savings or improvements in efficiency 
that help reduce the costs of more expensive options 
even further below those that would exist otherwise. 
The focus on the cheapest individual options will not 
result in the least expensive overall transition. That outcome requires a holistic approach. This study finds that 
only when all these options are pursued simultaneously 
can the share of renewables in TFEC in Mexico be raised 
to 21% by 2030.
The cost-supply curves for the business and government perspective are presented twice. They are coloured once by resource and once by sector. In Figure 
27 and Figure 29, the cost-supply curves are displayed 
with the technologies coloured by sector. These show 
that most of the identified potential involves renewable 
energy options in the power sector.
In the REmap cost-supply curves, the Reference Case 
growth in renewable energy in 2010-2030 is shown by 
the first horizontal bar in grey. The results of the REmap 
analysis and accelerated deployment of renewable energy (the REmap Options) are plotted on the curve as Figure 28: REmap Options cost-supply curve, government perspective, by resource

Cost-curve results by sector and technology
The results in Figure 26 are dependent on projections 
of technology costs and fuel prices. An overview of the 
assumptions underlying these projections is available 
in Annexes A and E44. The technology option mix and 
costs vary according to sector. Costs associated with 
the Reference Case are not quantified because they are 
part of expected energy system developments and are 
outside the boundaries of the REmap analysis.
When viewed from business (national prices) and government perspectives (international prices) the REmap 
44 These estimates are based on 2030 capital cost projections for 
energy technologies and assume an average increase in fossil fuel 
prices of 50% in 2010-2030.
cost-supply curves show that a big share of REmap Options could be deployed with cost savings compared to 
conventional technology alternatives.
The least expensive renewable energy options are 
derived from biomass and geothermal sources. The 
cost-competitiveness of industrial CHP using biomass 
arises partly from an assumption that the corresponding 
REmap Options use biomass residues. These are very 
inexpensive (USD 2-5/GJ). Efficient combustion of 
biomass residues in CHPs (including bagasse from sugar 
cane production) can be a cost-effective alternative to 
fossil fuels and a good way to phase in renewable 
power. Furthermore, a mix of bioenergy, solar thermal 
and geothermal can replace petroleum products in the 
industry sector. These are typically used for process 
heat generation in Mexico.45
45 If the REmap Options were to be compared using the fall in the oil 
price experienced as this report was in progress, they would come 
out as less cost-effective. This is particularly the case for industry 
and transport, where petroleum products are being replaced. Figure 29: REmap Options cost-supply curve, government perspective, by sector Average substitution cost (US

figure starts at 6% to show REmap technology options more clearly.
Substitution costs are also cost-competitive for heating 
in both building and industry sectors. This is because 
solar water heaters in Mexico have low capital cost and 
high capacity factors. They are assumed to replace conventional heating boilers mostly fed by expensive LPG 
at forecast oil prices. Solar water heat would also be 
cost-competitive if used in Mexico to replace natural gas 
in process heat generation. However, petroleum products rather than gas are typically used for this process 
in Mexico. Biomass and waste used in clinker production 
to replace coal is also nearly cost-competitive with the 
identified renewable energy technology options. In the 
buildings sector, solar water heaters show a similar cost 
advantage as process heat generation in the industry 
sector. Replacing traditional biomass use with biogas 
and residues is also cost-effective due to the high efficiency of modern cook stoves and the low price of biomass feedstock. However, solar cooling used to replace 
electricity for air conditioners has a high substitution 
cost due to the high capital costs and low annual utilisation rates of solar cooling units.
The outlook for biofuels and EVs in the transport sector 
is more problematic. SENER forecasts that gasoline and 
diesel prices will increase to around USD 30/GJ (around 
30-40%) by 2030 compared to the 2010 level. These 
projections incorporate an end to present subsidies 
on petroleum products. This is in line with fuel market 
liberalisation. However, price projections and assumptions on technology development show biofuels are still 
expected to be slightly more expensive in 2030 than 
their petroleum equivalents. This is described in the appendices to this report.
The major renewable energy potential for 
heating can be realised and result in savings 
at the same time given the availability of 
low-priced biomass residues and waste, and 
cost-competitive solar water heaters.
Average substitution costs are positive for power generation (i.e. above the average cost of conventional 
power) even though they encompass a range of tech-nologies including low-cost biomass. This is in part 
because several of the various REmap Options (solar 
PV rooftop, offshore wind, CSP) have fairly high capital 
costs. They are assumed to replace inexpensive natural 
gas generation. However, power from biomass, geothermal, utility-scale PV and onshore wind (in zones with 
high resources) can save costs. The positive or negative 
effects that the integration of this renewable energy 
capacity would have on the system are not analysed in 
this study.
Table 14 shows the average cost of substitution for each 
end-use sector. Accelerating Mexico’s uptake of renewable energy could result in savings. These amount to 
USD 0.1/GJ (USD 0.4/MWh) in the business perspective 
and USD 2.0/GJ (USD 7.2/MWh) in the government perspective compared to developing the equivalent new 
capacity with conventional generation.46 The savings in 
the government perspective would equate to 9% of the 
cost of natural gas power generation in 2030.
If viewed by technology, the substitution cost drivers 
are evident. Table 15 provides an overview of the current and projected LCOE for new capacity power plants. 
This is based on technology and exploitation costs alone 
46 SENER projections for installed power capacity and generation 
in 2027 show coal power generation is run at a capacity factor of 
60% (SENER, 2013a). This value has been considered as input for 
performance data for coal generation. Given that some renewable 
energy technologies are replacing this fossil fuel, average costs of 
substitution would slightly increase, from USD -0.1 to USD 0.3 per 
GJ in the business perspective, and from USD -2.0 to USD -1.6 per 
GJ in the government perspective. This assumes the capacity factor is increased to 80%.
without accounting for any type of incentive. According to REmap 2030, around 15-20 GW of onshore wind 
capacity in high wind resource sites (approximately 
40% of the technical potential for wind) will be costcompetitive with natural gas by 2030. In addition, utility-scale solar PV, geothermal and power installations 
fed with biomass residues are also expected to be costcompetitive with natural gas generation in 2030. This 
cost-competitiveness means that no economic incentive is provided. All other technologies are estimated to 
be more expensive than coal and natural gas, although 
onshore wind with lower resource potential and large 
hydropower are almost cost-competitive by 2030.
It is worth noting that rooftop PV is one of the only technologies that can produce electricity directly at point 
of consumption. A comparison with generation costs 
(e.g., LCOE) of alternative large-scale fossil fuel technologies is therefore not the most appropriate. Rather, 
if viewed from a ‘plug-parity perspective’ i.e., compared 
to the retail price of electricity, rooftop solar PV (whose 
generation cost is estimated to average USD 0.11/kWh) 
would provide savings. They need to be compared to 
retail electricity tariffs of around USD 0.16-0.19/kWh 
including the energy rate but excluding fixed charges. 
As for any of the other technologies, the impact that 
distributed solar PV could have on-grid costs (related to 
power losses, flows or infrastructure) is not considered 
in the analysis.
The costs of assuring system reliability for intermittent 
power and variable renewable energy are also outside 
the scope of this study. However, they could have a

Compared to equivalent new capacity using conventional generation, accelerating Mexico’s 
uptake of renewable energy could result in savings of USD 0.1/GJ (USD 0.4/MWh) using 
the business perspective. It could result in savings of USD 2.0/GJ (USD 7.2/MWh) using the 
government perspective.major effect on power generation cost rankings. This 
is especially true for Mexico where the variable renewable energy share could reach 26% by 2030. External 
costs related to fossil fuel power generation are not accounted for in these LCOE calculations.
Benefits of REmap Options
Economic arguments for increased renewable energy 
are accompanied by strong environmental arguments. 
The REmap Options would result in an estimated annual reduction in CO2 of 102 million tonnes (Mt) per 
year by 2030 (Table 16) from over 615 to 513 million 
tonnes. Reductions in the power sector of 78 million 
tonnes represent three quarters of total mitigation. If 
all REmap Options were deployed, Mexico could reduce 
the growth of CO2 emissions in 2010-2030 from 70% (in 
the Reference Case) to 40%.
Socio-economic benefits are also anticipated from 
increasing the renewables share in Mexico. Various 
sources focusing on Mexico show the employment

Note: The LCOE assumes a national discount rate of 10%. In the case of utility-scale and rooftop PV, LCOE is higher than costs in the US, for 
instance, in zones with similar solar irradiance. This is due to higher discount rates in Mexico, combined with the fact that it is a young market. 
Thus the annualised capital costs are higher (around 20-30% when compared the US).
Onshore wind, utility-scale solar PV and geothermal would be cost-competitive with natural 
gas power plants in 2030. However, this will depend on the trajectory of natural gas prices.

energy (see Table 17). With increasing renewable energy 
deployment, the total number of people employed in 
the sector will continue to rise. SENER estimates that 
175 000 direct, indirect and induced jobs could be created in all renewable energy technologies combined 
by 2020 (IRENA, 2013b). At the same time, however, it 
must be recognised that jobs would be lost in the conventional energy sector.
Furthermore, implementing all REmap Options could 
halve Mexico’s total coal demand by 2030 compared to 
2010. Based on steam coal national prices, this would 
result in annual savings in Mexico’s energy bill of USD 
1.4 billion by 2030. This is equivalent to the amount all 
sectors paid for coal purchases in 2010. The savings on 
expenditures for oil products in 2030 could be as high 
as USD 4.2 billion per year, 60% of that in the industry 
sector. Savings in natural gas consumption by the power 
sector could be USD 6.6 billion per year accompanied 
by decreasing dependence on imported natural gas. 
These estimates assume no fossil fuel backup power capacity is needed. If accounted for, this would otherwise 
reduce these fuel savings.
From a government perspective REmap Options identified in Mexico show a negative incremental system 
cost47, or cost savings of around USD 1.6 billion in 2030 
(Table 18). This does not include benefits related to air 
pollution reductions affecting health and CO2 emissions. 
If such externalities were to be included, and depending 
on how these are valued, full deployment of the REmap 
Options could result in annual estimated reduced health 
costs of USD 1 – 2 billion by 2030. These avoided exter47 Net incremental system costs are the sum of the differences between capital and operating expenditures of all energy technologies based on their deployment in REmap 2030 and the Reference 
Case in 2030.

caused by air pollution from fossil power plants, fuels in 
the transport sector and biomass in the buildings sector. 
Power and buildings enjoy 45% of the benefits, and less 
than 10% goes to the transport sector.
If the emissions reductions of 102 million tonne CO2 are 
taken into account, an additional USD 2-8 billion per 
year could be saved by 2030.48 About three quarters of 
these reductions are related to the power sector.
The aggregated benefit is an energy system cost reduction of USD 4.6-11.6 billion per year. Increasing the share 
of modern renewable energy from 4.4% in 2010 to 21% 
by 2030 produces significant savings if external costs 
of fossil fuels are included. This depends on how these 
are valued.
Modern forms of biomass result in similar emissions 
when combusted. However, they are negligible compared to the externalities from indoor air pollution 
caused by traditional biomass use. In the case of power 
generation, a considerable share of renewable power 
originates from renewable energy sources that do not 
result in any direct emissions. This includes solar PV, 
wind or geothermal compared to coal or natural gas. 
Despite the fact that modern forms of biomass also 
create external costs, these avoided externalities from 
fossil fuel combustion related to human health can be 
considered realistic. Nevertheless, a comprehensive estimate of replacement costs viewed from the government 
perspective would need to net out external renewable 
and fossil costs. Although this study only considers external costs related to air pollution, both renewables and 
48 Efficient mitigation assumes that the cost of prevention does not 
exceed the cost of the damages prevented. 
fossil fuel also use water and land. These concerns could 
be included in a more detailed and exhaustive external 
cost review.
According to a 2014 World Bank analysis, external costs 
related to SO2, NOx and PM10 emissions from power 
generation have been estimated in other studies to 
range from as low as USD 0.005/kWh to USD 0.027 
– 0.036  kWh. These values arise in the critical pollution zones of Salamanca and Tula, respectively. This 
depends on the methodology used (see Table 19 for a 
comparison of the values by SENER, the World Bank 
and IRENA). On an annual basis these external costs 
would amount to USD 0.8-4.5 billion in 2030, given that 
unit external costs exceed the REmap estimates. The 
low end of this range is close to the REmap estimates of 
USD 0.4-1 billion per year for the power sector. SENER 
has published preliminary estimates of external costs 
of power generation emissions (SENER, 2013b), based 
on a CEPAL externalities study (CEPAL, 2007). This is 
shown in Table 19.
Table 18 also shows that a 21% renewable energy share in 
renewable energy technologies by 2030 would require 
an average annual investment of USD 11.8 billion through 
to 2030.49 Of this, USD 6.9 billion would come from the 
REmap Options and USD 4.9 billion from investments 
taking place in the Reference Case. Since the REmap 
Options investments eliminate a USD 0.3 billion investment in conventional energy variants, the incremental 
annual investment50 needed would be USD 6.6 billion. 
49 Investments refer to gross rather than incremental investments 
for all renewable energy technologies deployed between now and 
2030. 
50 Net incremental investment needs are the difference between the 
annual investment needs of all REmap Options and the investment 
needed otherwise for conventional technologies.

Options technologies with positive substitution costs 
‘competitive’ with fossil technologies.
A 21% renewables share results in annual 
net savings of USD 1.6 billion in Mexico’s 
total energy system by 2030. If savings from 
improved human health from reduced air 
pollution and lower CO2 emissions are also 
taken into account, they amount to USD 4.6-
11.6 billion annually.
7.4 Discussion of REmap Options 
and implementation challenges
The energy generated in REmap 2030 draws on a variety of renewable resources for electricity, heat and 
biofuels, and includes a small contribution from electrification in the transport sector. Renewable energy climbs 
to almost 21% of the general energy mix and more than 
doubles to 46% in the power sector. Realising this potential means overcoming economic, deployment and 
system integration challenges. This is particularly relevant for technologies that make a major contribution to 
renewable energy use. These are biomass (38% of total 
final renewable energy use), solar power/heating (23%) 
and wind (18%). The rest of this section covers the main 
issues for each resource and for final use that could arise 
from deploying REmap 2030.
Wind
Wind power is the dominant renewable energy technology for power generation in REmap 2030 (92 TWh/
year in 2030). Total installed capacity in 2030 would be 
31 GW. Total installed capacity for onshore wind in 2013 
(the most recent year for which data are available) is 
1.7 GW (SENER, 2014a). This would require an average 
installation rate of 1.7 GW/year to realise the REmap 
2030 potential. This would include exploiting 12 GW 
already estimated to be economically feasible by 2020 
(IEA Wind, 2012), as developed in the Reference Case. 
It would include an additional 18 GW under REmap Options by 2030. Around 50% (9 GW) of these additions 
are considered cost-effective compared to power generation based on natural gas in 2030.
The area with the largest onshore wind resource is in the 
Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the state of Oaxaca where 
the economically feasible potential is calculated to be 
over 6 GW by 2020 (IEA Wind, 2012). La Rumorosa in 
the state of Baja California is another area with great 
resources. It benefits from more than 5 GW of potential that could be deployed (Secretariat of Economy, 
2013). Exploitation of wind in these two regions would 
already represent a third of the total capacity targeted 
in REmap 2030.
Two obstacles need to be overcome. One is the need 
for transmission capacity both in zones with high wind 
potential and where investments are economically feasible. The second is the implementation of measures to 
integrate renewables into the power system. This will be 
partly influenced by how cost sharing is worked out for 
new connections and by grid expansion planning in new 
legislation. The new regulatory framework permitting 
the Mexican government to contract with private firms 
is expected to alleviate the challenges of integrating 
wind into the power grid.
Some measures have already been implemented to expand the grid. Transmission lines have been recently extended (IEA Wind, 2012) for the Isthmus of Tehuantepec 
under the open season scheme (see section 3). A 
subsequent open season round was run to add 2 GW 
of transmission capacity in this zone and over 3 GW in 
the Baja California and Tamaulipas states. This is still 
under construction, and is to be deployed in the next 
few years.
The subsystem for Baja California still lacks an interconnection with the national grid, despite a long-stated 
plan to complete one. At the moment, the first phase of 
the interconnection is due to be ready by 2017 (SENER, 
2013a) but expected capacity will be limited to around 
300 MW (SENER, 2012h). Challenges arising from local 
features in the landscape would also need to be accounted for in planning, since not all high resource areas 
will be easily accessible.
About 200 companies in Mexico are capable of supplying some of the components of wind turbines. Experienced engineering and construction firms (IEA Wind, 
2012) in Mexico could become wind project developers 
or work on engineering, procurement and construction.The government has created an inclusive national initiative for innovation in wind technology, the Mexican 
Centre for Energy Innovation in Wind (Centro Mexicano 
de Innovación en Energía). This is one of several energy 
innovation centres. This centre’s main research areas include wind turbines, grid integration capacity development, aerodynamics and aeroelasticity, wind resource, 
artificial intelligence and mechatronics. The country’s 
growing knowledge of both project and technology 
development will be essential to realise the large wind 
power potential.
Solar PV
In order to achieve the 30 GW of installed solar capacity 
proposed for REmap 2030, an average 1.5 GW needs 
to be installed each year between now and 2030. This 
installation rate is 15 times higher than for similar recent 
additions in Mexico. Specifically, annual additions of 
1 GW are forecast to 2020, accelerating to 2 GW/year 
in 2020-2030. This would allow annual installations 
estimated at about 76 GW to make up 2-3% of total 
peak demand in 2030. This is half the level of around 5% 
seen in Germany in recent years. Experience in Germany 
showed that these levels can be reached without significant grid integration problems.
According to REmap 2030 estimates, distributed PV 
generation (rooftop solar and off-grid solar home systems could account for 11.3 GW – 7% of total 2030 generation capacity. Off-grid solar home systems to meet 
rural electrification needs will consist of less than 300 
MW. If all the remainder were rooftop solar PV, panels 
would be needed for less than 10% of total building roof 
space. Opportunities will arise in new houses/buildings 
in particular. Given the large capacity of solar thermal 
already assumed for buildings in Mexico, it will be necessary to consider competition with solar thermal for roof 
availability. It is estimated that one in every six homes 
will have solar water heater systems by 2030. This falls 
to one in five if only households with firm rooftops are 
considered, as discussed below.
In 2010, there were three international solar PV module 
producers and two national companies assembling 
modules in Mexico. Total module production capacity 
of these manufacturers, operating at 84% capacity, was 
275 MW. This was mostly aimed at the export market 
(Huacuz & Agredano, 2011; IEA, 2010). Total production capacity is now more than 300 MW, the highest 
among Latin American countries (Secretariat of Economy, 2013). Under these circumstances, 60% of solar PV 
modules needed to achieve REmap estimates will need 
to be imported (at least 90 million) unless local industry 
is developed to meet this demand.
Solar thermal
Solar thermal is now the third largest renewable heat 
resource after wood and sugar cane bagasse (SENER, 
2013c). Yet current deployment is still low. In order to 
achieve long-term development in line with REmap 
2030, particular issues need to be considered in the 
industry and buildings sectors.
The 14 GW solar thermal increase for manufacturing 
uses by 2030 starting from a very low base in 2010, 
means the annual installation of approximately 700 
MW in solar thermal capacity in 2010-2030. Total solar 
thermal generation would represent more than 4% of 
industry’s total heating demand. An IRENA study on 
the manufacturing industry (IRENA, 2014c) indicates 
around 45% of heat demand in industrial processes 
corresponds to low temperature heat that could be 
provided by solar thermal technologies. It estimates 
a techno-economic potential of about 3% worldwide 
for solar thermal. A slightly higher share for a country 
with high solar irradiation is thus found to be realistic. 
The potential estimated solar cooling in food production processes is less than 1% of total power demand 
in 2030. Assuming about 5-10 MW capacity per production plant, this would require about 1 500-3 000 
production facilities to be equipped with solar thermal 
plants. Solar thermal heat has high installation costs, 
especially if built with concentrated solar thermal collectors. These are now partly subsidised by more general 
national financing programmes not specifically aimed 
at renewables developments. More targeted financing 
for renewables is one of the challenges to be resolved 
to fulfil the REmap potential.
Solar thermal energy in buildings for solar water heating 
systems is expected to experience significant growth 
even in the Reference Case. The economics of solar 
water heating systems are based on fuel savings. These 
are a function of the price of the fuel being replaced as 
well as installation costs. LPG is the main fuel used for 
water heating, while Mexico enjoys high solar irradiation. 
It already makes economic sense, therefore, to install 
solar thermosiphon systems for water heating.Under REmap 2030, 23% of total energy demand for 
water heating (320 PJ) can be met by solar thermal 
energy.51 This would imply adding 1.5 million m2/year of 
collector area in 2015-2030 (a fivefold increase when 
compared to the 300 000 m2 added in 2011) for a total 
cumulative capacity of 32 million m.2 According to a 
CONUEE study, a solar thermal collector area of about 
4 m2 is enough for the average household (CONUEE, 
2007). This would imply installing 370 000 solar water 
heaters per year in the residential sector in 2013-2030). 
This is equivalent to equipping 20% of all homes with a 
structurally sound roof with solar thermal (or approximately 5.5 million households) by 2030.52 Around ten 
million new homes dwellings are expected to be constructed in 2010-2030. This creates the opportunity for 
direct solar water heater integration instead of retrofit.
Realizing this potential will mean embedding technology standards, certification and control of solar water 
heater systems and installation. This is necessary to 
assure quality performance and to attain maximum 
efficiency of installation. At present a wide range of 
systems exist with greatly varying quality and performance. On occasions, unqualified developers undertake 
projects.
Two barriers need to be overcome on the users’ side. 
The first relates to awareness of the economic opportunity and benefits of solar water heating. The 
second concerns finance availability to facilitate initial 
investment by households. The government’s ‘green 
mortgage’ programme in place since 2010 addresses 
this issue. It aims to promote the use of clean and efficient technologies in households, including water and 
energy services. Although it applies to all sectors, it 
is intended mainly for low-income families. These can 
make savings on their water and energy bills, reducing 
costs while protecting the environment (BSHF, n.d.). The 
programme provides both information and financial as51 Solar thermal for water heating in 2010 provided 3% of energy 
consumption. 
52 This has been calculated using a 1.5% cumulative average growth 
rate in dwellings (SENER, 2013c), which generates the total number for households for 2030. This is a conservative estimate 
compared to the 2% historical cumulative average growth rate 
in 2000-2010 (INEGI, 2014). Structurally sound roofs, which are 
capable of accommodating solar water heating equipment, are 
estimated in 70% of homes (SENER, 2013b). If all households are 
considered, the total share of households with solar water heating 
declines to 15%. 
sistance to potential consumers of solar energy in enduse sectors for purposes other than power generation.53
If Mexico fulfils its distributed electricity and 
heating generation potential, 22% of the 38 
million homes predicted for 2030 would have 
solar water heating systems and 10% would 
have solar PV rooftops by 2030.
Biomass
In REmap 2030, total primary biomass use reaches 
810 PJ, which would exceed the low supply potential 
estimates of 600 PJ. In order to ensure that demand 
is met, Mexico may need to import biomass, reduce 
demand needs through energy efficiency programmes 
or deploy its full energy crop and forest wood potential. 
These two biomass sources are not fully considered in 
this low supply potential estimate. Energy crops, whose 
potential is excluded from this study, could have further 
potential for various uses in Mexico, either to generate 
power/heat or as feedstock for liquid biofuels production. However, the sustainability of energy crops is a 
major concern, as is the ever-present potential competition with food production for land and water resources.
Most biomass used for power generation is sugar cane 
bagasse used in the sugar industry. In 2013, this accounted for nearly 90% of all biomass power generation, 
followed by biogas power produced from agriculture, 
industry and urban residues (SENER, 2013b). Industrial 
CHP accounts for 50% of all biomass power generation 
in 2030. Half of this is from bagasse and the other half a 
mix of other solid biomass and waste. Today about half 
the total bagasse generated is used for power generation. REmap 2030 assumes that all bagasse generated 
would be efficiently utilised in industrial CHP plants.
Biomass use in buildings is virtually unchanged in 2030. 
However, there is a significant shift to more efficient 
biomass resource use in the most modern household 
woodfuel cook stoves and in improved earth ovens for 
charcoal production. The Reference Case still includes 
53 The ‘green mortgage’ is a “housing finance scheme developed by 
the Institute for the National Workers’ Housing Fund.” Families 
purchasing homes using this fund are given an additional ‘green’ 
mortgage of up to USD 1 250 to cover the cost of additional ecotechnologies.” This is a credit on top of the actual mortgage credit 
(BSHF, n.d.).20% of traditional biomass use in buildings for cooking, while REmap 2030 requires all households burning 
wood to install efficient wood cook stoves. It is most 
likely that achieving 100% efficient biomass use will 
need a certain level of government intervention to provide information, training and technical assistance as 
well as financing. Several such government initiatives 
to promote the increased use of the most modern cook 
stoves are already underway54.
Biomass use in transport under REmap 2030 is rather 
conservative. Studies assessing biomass resource potential estimate that the technical maximum sustainable 
potential55 for dedicated energy crops for ethanol and 
biodiesel production amounts to 540 PJ and 180 PJ per 
year, respectively (REMBIO, 2011). In these studies, only 
30% of sugar cane and sweet sorghum primary supply potential for bioethanol is exploited. In the case of 
biodiesel, 40% of palm oil and jatropha curcas potential 
would be utilised. Most of these dedicated energy crops 
are spread along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, where 
flat land is accessible, and precipitation is favourable 
(REMBIO, 2011). The bioenergy supply chain will need 
to be improved by 2030. For liquid biofuels, production 
plants can be constructed close to feedstock sources. 
Since liquid biofuels will still need to be transported to 
demand centres, advanced biofuel plants producing 
high value biofuels will be needed to assure economic 
transport and profitability.
In REmap 2030, nearly 90% of the total biomass supply 
potential is related to agricultural residues and biogas. 
Agricultural activity and cattle breeding are spread 
across the country, but agricultural residues are mainly 
located in the western and northern regions. They will 
need to be transported for use in manufacturing located 
mainly in central and southern regions, at least in part 
for power co-generation. Transportation costs reported 
in the literature range from as low as USD 2-3/GJ. This 
may account for up to half the total supply costs of 
biomass transported in long distances. For local use 
54 These programmes have been in place for some decades already. 
They address different issues, such as the design of more efficient 
woodfuel cook stoves, awareness-raising programmes among 
users, training for construction and subsidizing the total or a share 
of the required investments (Masera, Díaz, & Berrueta, n.d.). 
55 Sustainable supply is based on adequate land for harvesting each 
of the specified crops. It excludes land with food crops, areas 
covered by forest and tropical rainforests, natural conservation 
areas, terrain with gradients over 4-12% depending on the crop, 
and land that would require irrigation (REMBIO, 2011). 
of biomass and for short distance transportation, the 
contribution of transport costs to the total supply cost 
is much lower.
Biogas from animal manure is generated mainly in the 
northern and central parts of Mexico. It therefore has 
limited potential to replace traditional biomass use, 
centred mostly in Southern Mexico. A more likely replacement there will come from urban waste and local 
forestry residues.
Biomass supply potential needs to be fulfilled 
and a biomass market created to connect 
supply and demand in order to obtain the 
810 PJ of primary biomass estimated under 
REmap Options for 2030.
Renewable electricity integration challenges
The development of renewable energy in the power sector will result in socio-economic and strategic benefits. 
There are also benefits to the power system, such as the 
increase in overall power supply security arising from 
grid expansion. At a certain level of penetration, distributed generation can have a positive impact on congestion due to changes in power flows. Nevertheless, 
deploying high shares of variable renewables in power 
systems poses simultaneous challenges to integration 
in the existing energy mix, grid connection, and system 
and market operation. These factors vary by country, 
and there is no one-size-fits-all solution for integrating 
renewable electricity into the power system.
Adequate long-term planning for grid 
development is essential to meet the wind 
and solar power generation potential under 
REmap 2030.
REmap 2030 is a macro-level analysis that provides 
technology options for Mexico to 2030. It does not 
model the power system as a whole. To accelerate 
renewable energy uptake in Mexico, REmap estimates 
need to be supported with system-wide modelling to 
understand how a share of variable renewable energy 
estimated at 26% of total power generation in 2030 
can be accommodated in Mexico’s power system. No 
quantitative studies have yet been completed to assess 
the impact of variable renewable energy in Mexico. This makes it difficult to estimate the effects of 26% of variable renewable energy on the power system. Some available measurements related to the impacts of variable 
renewable energy penetration in the system, particularly 
from wind, are included points below.56 These are based 
on the experience of other countries whose renewable 
power penetration has reached significant levels. Putting REmap results into context will be particularly necessary for long-term power system planning in Mexico. 
They will determine optimal solutions to ensure security 
of generation supply, grid development and system 
balancing. This concerns interrelated requirements from 
long-term system adequacy until system reliability secures real-time system operation. This translates into 
having enough generation and transmission capacity 
in place to efficiently meet demand needs. System balancing covers unexpected disturbances, variability and 
forecast errors. The main challenges arising from these 
and creating corresponding solutions are summarised 
below.
1) To ensure generation adequacy, an adequate 
level of reserve margin57 needs to be maintained, 
as electricity demand increases by 2030 and so 
will peak demand. It will therefore be necessary 
to have enough available firm generation capacity to cover peak demand, along with using other 
solutions such as demand-side management or 
larger interconnection capacity.
Capacity credit/value is typically used when discussing available firm capacity. This is the value 
associated with the reliability of a technology 
to generate during peak load. It is expressed as 
a percentage of installed capacity to cover the 
peak load. Peak demand in 2012 reached 38 GW 
and is estimated at 77 GW in 203058 (SENER, 
2013a).
56 These results should be treated carefully as they are not 
representative of Mexico. Rather, they indicate the implications that 
other countries have had to take into account when integrating 
variable renewable energy.
57 The reserve margin is the difference between effective available 
capacity and peak demand, expressed as a percentage of peak 
demand.
58 Assuming the same in 2010 provided 3% of energy consumption.
This has been calculated using a 1.5% cumulative average growth 
rate of 4.1% for peak demand in the national interconnected system 
based on SENER (2013a) forecasts for the 2012-2027 period
In Mexico, wind capacity credit can reach to 
20-25% at low penetration levels (GIZ, 2014). 
Capacity credit decreases as penetration of wind 
power increases. In REmap 2030, penetration 
reaches 18%. Therefore, the capacity credit associated with this level of penetration could be 
set at around 10%. To maintain the reserve margin 
set in the Reference Case, a backup generation 
capacity of 6 GW would be needed. Assuming 
that this is built with gas, this implies an additional investment of around USD 300 million 
per year (less than 3% of total renewable energy 
investment needs of REmap 2030). This has not 
been considered in the cost/benefit analysis in 
REmap 2030.
No capacity credit values were available for solar PV. Given the 13% penetration level for total 
installed solar PV, it can be expected that the 
additional costs for backup generation capacity 
will not be large when compared to total system 
costs. This is the case for wind.
Appropriate market signals are needed to incentivise the construction of conventional power 
plants to reach the required reserve margin given 
the renewable energy share increase under REmap 2030. They would be needed to cover peak 
load, and would therefore experience lower hours 
of operation.
2) Transmission capacity expansion will have a major impact on integrating variable renewable 
energy into the grid. Additional transmission 
capacity will be needed for wind and solar PV in 
northern and western Mexico, sparsely populated 
areas remote from industrial activity. Effective 
transmission expansion planning will be necessary where supply and demand are far apart. 
Construction and investments required for new 
capacity can take a long time.
IEA estimates the incremental costs of renewable 
integration into the grid at USD 2-13/MWh. This 
is a minor increase of 2-15% compared to LCOE 
for wind generation, to which costs of this type 
are allocated. Typically a transmission system 
operator (TSO) would consider three drivers for 
grid expansion: renewable interconnection, market condition improvement and supply security. These are not necessarily driven by resources but 
they aim to meet consumer demand in the most 
reliable and affordable way. The grid is used by all 
types of power generation technologies. Hence, 
additional costs would be allocated among both 
conventional and renewable forms of power generation.
3) Grid codes will need to be defined on the services 
renewable power generators should provide to 
the network. Examples are fault ride-through 
capabilities,59 reactive power supply or contribution to system operation with output and ramping60 controls.
CENACE will need to cope with planning and 
operating more complex physical systems, including wind and solar PV generation forecasts. 
This is particularly important given challenges 
to ensure grid stability and potential balancing 
costs. Describing experience in other countries, 
IEA Wind Task 25 estimates the increase in shortterm reserve requirements (from hourly to dayahead) at a 20% penetration (Holttinen et al., 
2013). This is similar to Mexico. Requirements 
differ widely. They are 1% in Germany where forecast errors are considered one hour ahead. In the 
UK, where no forecasting is performed and the 
analysis considers variability61 four hours ahead, 
they are as much as 19% Thus far, this increase 
in short-term reserves does not imply additional 
generation capacity. It is purely a matter of how 
existing power plants are utilised.
Balancing cost increases can be less than USD 
1/MWh for a wind penetration of 20%, as is the 
case in Scandinavia. By contrast, they are almost 
USD 6/MWh in the US. These costs are minimal 
and would represent 1-7% of average onshore 
wind production costs.
59 This is an electrical device capability, especially for wind generators, and allows them to operate through periods of lower grid 
voltage.
60 Ramping is the ability to rapidly increase or decrease generating 
levels to maintain system stability when generation from other 
sources drops off unexpectedly.
61 The increment in short-term reserves significantly increases when 
no wind is forecast as part of system operation (Holttinen et al., 
2011). This should give an idea of the level of complexity and variation of these estimates for different power systems. This points to 
the need to carry out similar studies for Mexico. 
4) It is important to adjust system and market operation rules to prevent them obstructing renewable energy incentives. These include curtailment 
rules, penalisation for deviations from committed 
supply, and unit commitment time windows.62
5) The technical adequacy of existing and future 
generation plant design needs to be assessed. 
This informs planning for particular plant types, 
such as highly efficient power plants or plants 
with more ramping flexibility – especially in the 
case of gas power. This is particularly important as PV will have a large share of capacity. In 
Mexico, this stops generating some time before 
the evening peak. It is therefore crucial to ensure 
the system has enough flexibility to handle high 
upward ramping needs. As most of this capacity 
in REmap 2030 is added to the Reference Case, 
it will be necessary to adjust long-term flexibility 
considerations to put optimal solutions in place.
To summarise, grid integration creates challenges. Flexible operational practices, flexible generation and demand side management are potential solutions. Important solutions relating to system operation include 
greater interconnection capacity and balancing areas, 
lower gate closure time frames, accurate forecasting 
systems, and subhourly dispatch schedule updates.
The high penetration of renewables in the 
power system in REmap 2030 will raise 
challenges related to generation supply, 
grid development and system balancing. The 
integration and related solutions will largely 
be a matter of adequate planning, and would 
not entail significant integration costs.
Given Mexico’s large geographical area and dispersed 
communities, mini-grids and rural electrification will 
also play a crucial role. This will help limit grid integration challenges and transmission capacity expansion. In 
urban areas, distributed generation on building rooftops 
will also play a major role. Both of these have major potential under REmap 2030. The expected deployment 
of distributed generation will necessitate the management of new challenges related to distribution grid 
62 Implementing shorter intervals for unit commitment and dispatch 
lowers the forecast errors. operation. It will mean finding the best way to make use 
of electricity generated by self-suppliers. This includes 
the design of net-metering schemes, the potential use 
of storage etc.
Electrification
The REmap analysis showed that biomass resources in 
Mexico play an important role in increasing the renewable share. Bioenergy is responsible for more than a 
third of the additional potential, primarily in the end-use 
sectors. However, affordable and sustainable biomass 
sourcing remains an important question. Deploying 
alternative and complementary renewable energy resources can help reduce potential dependence on biomass.
Alternatives in heating are limited, especially for high 
temperature process heat generation in the manufacturing sector. Thus far, this has only been generated 
from biomass or fossil fuel. In the buildings sector, solar 
thermal, heat pumps and geothermal are alternatives 
to biomass, although onsite land availability, costs and 
access to resources could be constraints.
There are many options in the power sector. Solar PV, 
onshore/offshore wind, CSP, hydropower, geothermal 
and marine technologies all have further potential beyond the REmap 2030 estimates.
In the transport sector, liquid biofuels play the most 
important role in raising the sector’s renewable energy 
share. Next to the use of biofuels, the contribution of EVs 
is substantial, providing around 40% of the additional 
renewable energy potential from a passenger-kilometre 
perspective. In REmap 2030 no additional modal shifts 
are assumed for transport beyond the Reference Case. 
However, electrification options are commercially viable 
and their deployment could be accelerated instead of or 
alongside liquid biofuels growth.
An additional set of REmap Options was created called 
REmap-E to further explore and clarify the additional 
electricity potential in end-use sectors. This considers a 
more radical electrification scheme than REmap 2030. 
It replaces most biomass with electricity from renewables. In REmap-E, three technology strategies are used 
to reduce biomass dependency and increase the share 
of electricity in end-use sectors. Heat pumps instead of 
biomass deliver the required heat in the buildings sector and low temperature process heat for industry. In 
the transport sector, modal shifts (public trams, electric 
buses and trains) replace liquid biofuels. The increased 
electricity demand from these end-use sectors is supplied by additional solar PV and on/offshore wind capacity. Additional solar PV and wind generation could 
also replace power that would otherwise have been 
generated by biomass.
In 2030, annual electricity demand rises from around 
20 TWh to 27 TWh. This is the result of electrification in 
the manufacturing industry and a switch from biomass 
to heat pumps. In the transport sector a switch to different forms of electric mass transit results in an increased 
annual demand for electricity of 3 TWh. In buildings the 
increased use of heat pumps results in an additional annual electricity demand of 5 TWh.
In REmap-E, TFEC in 2030 is 6.8 EJ compared to 7.3 EJ 
in REmap 2030. This saving of almost 7% is due mainly 
to the higher technical efficiency of electrification technologies over combustion energy systems when viewed 
in terms of final energy. For example, the efficiency of a 
heat pump to deliver heat is three to four times higher 
than that of a steam boiler. Efficiency differences relating to modal shift are even higher. They may be as much 
as ten times higher when an electric tram is compared 
to an internal combustion engine. REmap-E results in 
almost 100 PJ less of renewables than REmap 2030 
due to reduced biomass consumption. Yet the lower 
TFEC means the relative share of renewables is similar 
(20% versus 21%). This still amounts to a nearly fivefold 
increase in renewables share in 2010-2030.
REmap-U presents an alternative case to REmap 2030. 
It assumes all countries approach a 30% renewable 
energy share by 2030 regardless of where they stand 
today. It does not include individual national goals, but 
assumes a broad mix of different renewable energy 
technologies. In their Reference Cases, some countries 
would need to substantially increase their renewable 
energy shares to approach 30%. However, others would 
meet or even exceed this level. Not all countries need to 
achieve exactly 30% to contribute to the global 30% renewable energy share in REmap-U is met. For instance, 
Mexico only achieves 27%.
A number of technology options and strategies are 
required to meet this global goal of 30%. According to 
REmap-U, the first strategy in all countries is to reduce energy demand by implementing energy efficiency 
measures. The reduction potential would differ for each 
country, varying with the growth of energy consumption and the present level and distribution of energy 
intensity. For Mexico, an energy saving potential of 5% 
was assumed over 2030 consumption levels.
The second strategy involves using increased electrification technologies in countries that do not achieve a 30% 
renewable energy share after both REmap Options and 
energy efficiency improvements are exhausted. This 
is the case for Mexico. The electrification technologies 
chosen for Mexico are those used in REmap-E. Finally 
to increase renewable energy even further, an annual 
increase in both solid and liquid biomass imports of 
around 240 PJ is assumed (wood fuel for heating and 
biofuels for transport). As shown in Figure 30, REmap-U 
takes the Mexican renewables share to 28%, a significant 
increase over the 21% in REmap 2030.
Figure 30 compares the renewable energy share in 
Mexico’s energy mix of 2030 under three possible fuFigure 30: Renewable energy technology options under REmap 2030, REmap-E and REmap-U, 2030

specific to Mexico. REmap-U shows how a 30% renewable energy share could be achieved on a global basis 
if every country were to deploy even higher shares of 
renewables than envisaged in REmap 2030.
Figure 30 also shows only minor additions of biomass 
use in REmap-E. By contrast, the additions to solar PV 
(yellow bars), onshore and offshore wind are higher 
than under REmap 2030. This is due to electrification 
in end-use sectors. The total capacity of solar PV and 
wind reaches 25-30 GW and 38-42 GW, respectively in 
REmap-E. This also further raises the variable renewable energy share, implying that even more efforts will 
be required to ensure grid stability compared to REmap 
2030.
The substitution costs of REmap-E and REmap-U are 
estimated to be somewhat higher than for REmap 2030. 
Among the three cases, REmap-E is the most expensive. Its cost depends on the mix of renewable power 
technologies employed to increase electrification, and 
on the potential need for supporting infrastructure. 
The cost increase is also driven by higher installation 
or infrastructure costs for electrification technologies 
(EVs, electric public transport and heat pumps). Under 
REmap-U, the cost of substitution is higher than under 
REmap 2030 but lower than under REmap-E. A lower 
increase in REmap-E total electrification is realised in 
REmap-U, and this explains the lower cost. In addition, 
the assumed energy efficiency improvements yield 
cost savings, since less renewable energy capacity is 
required.The discussion that follows in this section introduces the 
main barriers encountered so far in renewable power 
development. This is practically the only sector that has 
made any headway so far. Renewables use in the heat 
and transport sectors was so far limited. By contrast, 
power generation is the main focus of renewable 
energy expansion in Mexico today. These barriers to 
renewable energy development need to be resolved 
in order to foster renewable energy uptake. Specific 
recommendations to overcome them are presented 
in the next section. It is worth mentioning that some 
of these are already the subject of provisions in the 
energy reforms. Once the liberalised energy markets 
are operational, some barriers not affected by new 
regulations may well be lowered. On the other hand, 
new barriers may arise.
Barriers and opportunities in the 
power sector
In the last 15 years Mexico has increasingly used natural 
gas for power generation instead of oil or coal. However, oil and gas reserves are diminishing, and imports 
continue to increase (EIA, 2013). This makes energy 
production from fossil fuels more expensive, and supply alternatives potentially more attractive. The 2013 
energy reform opens the oil, gas and electricity markets 
to foreign and private investors and to alternative forms 
of generation, ending the monopolies of state-owned 
utilities PEMEX and CFE. This highlights the need to 
establish a transmission system operator that assures 
electricity market access to all generators.
Both the energy reform and national energy strategy 
stress the importance of creating mechanisms and incentives for renewable energy. They aim to create appropriate opportunities for renewables deployment in 
Mexico. However, low-priced natural gas power generation will continue to provide economically competitive, 
low-cost electricity. This paves the way for politically 
attractive tariffs but may limit investment in renewables 
deployment.
The CEC scheme described above is a leading measure 
designed to accelerate renewable energy development. 
In principle this scheme should encourage fossil fuel 
power replacement with renewables. Yet it is unclear 
how these certificates will work. This may now present 
problems given the dominance of CFE in the market at 
the moment. It is equally difficult now that the electricity 
market is being opened up, but for different reasons.
8 BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR A 
RENEWABLE ENERGY TRANSITION
KEY POINTS
● In the last decade, Mexico had a strong preference for natural gas power plant construction. 
This trend can be altered in the future with 
policy support that improves the business case 
for renewables.
● The lack of transmission capacity in areas with 
high renewable energy resource potential has 
acted as one of the major obstacles to largescale renewables deployment. The open season 
has started to alleviate this problem, and it is 
expected that investments in transmission will 
follow more easily now that energy reforms 
have been made.
● Renewable energy projects are in many cases 
not profitable. Prior to the reforms there were 
no economic incentives to promote the development of renewable energy technologies.
● Regulatory certainty underpins the foundation 
of a clear and transparent framework for power 
sector operation, particularly since the energy 
reforms.Historical developments also affect the future of renewables. Both fossil fuel and nuclear power plants 
have long plant life expectancy. In 2011, the average age 
of Mexico’s coal and natural gas plants was 17 and 13 
years, respectively. This reflects the strong preference 
for gas in new plant construction in the last decade. It is 
likely that little of the natural gas capacity added before 
1980 (about 2.5 GW) can be retired by 2030, assuming 
a lifetime of 50 years. The coal capacity that can be retired by 2030 is about 6-7 GW. Hence, the replacement 
of fossil fuel power plants by renewable technologies in 
REmap 2030 does not assume fossil-fired capacity is 
retired early. Nonetheless planned retirements permit 
more than 2 GW of natural gas capacity to be included 
in REmap 2030.
In the last decade, Mexico had a strong 
preference for natural gas power plant 
construction. This trend can be altered in 
future with policy support that improves the 
business case for renewables.
One of the main obstacles to the development of largescale renewable energy lies in the lack of transmission 
capacity in areas with high renewable resource potential. Grid expansion plans for both CFE and project 
developers have historically been blocked by legal restrictions on how CFE should carry out investment in 
new transmission. Project developers needed assured 
transmission availability to commit to building a plant. 
Under the prior regulatory framework in Mexico, plans 
for transmission expansion required up to ten years. 
This is longer than the time required for deploying an 
average power plant. Some provisions in the energy 
reform concern transmission expansion. It is therefore 
expected that transmission planning schedules will be 
more consistent with the needs of investors planning 
additional generating capacity, especially in renewable 
energy zones with high potential.
However, as noted in Section 3.2, nearly 2 000 MW 
of wind power was deployed under the open season 
mechanism63 (Wood, Lozano, Romero-Hernandez, & 
Romero-Hernandez, 2012). Before this, there were no 
clear and transparent rules on renewables grid connection and cost-sharing, which contributed to their limited 
deployment. Final rules have not yet been established, 
63 See the part of “Transmission grids” in Section 3.2 for further details.
but should further direct these access and cost-sharing 
concerns to prevent discrimination. The Ministry of 
Energy will now develop transmission expansion plans 
in cooperation with CENACE and CRE. This will include 
long-run expansion plans based on the principles of 
sustainability and economic viability.
The government can now contract with private firms 
to extend, modernise, finance and/or operate its transmission projects, as well as modernise distribution networks. This eases the path of renewable energy deployment. New transmission lines can now be constructed 
either with federal funding or by private sector concession, thus relieving pressure on the federal budget.
Risk allocation is every bit as important to investors as 
cost-sharing. Risk allocation is a problem common to all 
IPPs. For this reason, project finance is often used for 
private investment in off-grid power generation. A few 
other financing arrangements to limit risk and guarantee profitability include long-term power contracts, high 
credit ratings for power contract offtakers and engineering, procurement and construction contracts with highly 
ranked firms. Some IPPs may seek to contract with a 
group of industrial users under the rubric of electricity 
generation associations. This permits larger and possibly more efficient projects that benefit from economies 
of scale and allow greater cost and risk-sharing.
The lack of transmission capacity in areas with 
high renewable energy resource potential 
has acted as one of the major obstacles to 
large-scale renewables deployment. The 
open season has started to alleviate this 
problem, and it is expected that investments 
in transmission will follow more easily now 
that energy reforms have been made.
Some non-utility and small-scale power projects may 
experience difficulties in qualifying for or negotiating 
reasonable finance despite the fact that installing these 
systems creates major energy savings. Even if the energy reform foresees a wholesale market, at least in the 
short to medium term, renewable energy developers 
would thus still tend to establish bilateral contracts assuring profitability. It is hoped that eventually they can 
compete on a more efficient basis.
Equally lacking is the public and political drive to comprehensively develop a national renewable power in-dustry. This would include a certain amount of domestic 
renewable generation component manufacturing and 
national renewable power technology development, 
particularly for wind and solar PV. Spain, Germany and 
Denmark have all taken this route (Juárez-Hernández & 
León, 2014). Equipment production capacity exists today to deliver technology and its components. However, 
this would not suffice to meet growing demand, even 
in the Reference Case, unless its growth were aligned 
with plans for future renewable energy development 
in Mexico. Staggering investments would be required 
for Mexico to build its own entire equipment supply 
industry capable of raising solar PV module production 
from 300 today to 90 million. However, it might also be 
appropriate to import a proportion of PV panels and 
at the same time continue to build system design and 
installation expertise at home.
Renewable energy development is slow for a number 
of reasons, including the fact that many projects simple 
are not profitable or cost-competitive when compared 
to conventional generation technologies or reference 
electricity prices. Only further improvements to its 
economic efficiency or new economic incentives will 
alter this. Renewable energy could not compete on cost 
prior to the energy reform, when regulations limited the 
potential for private investment in renewable power. 
Even after the reform, they still cannot compete. Only 
a few projects today are profitable. Some projects that 
acquire permits for construction and generation cannot 
not be deployed because they are not always economically viable without any further subsidy or financial support. Investorts would be reluctant to invest in schemes 
that do not return the investment profitably.
Renewable energy projects are in many 
cases unprofitable. Prior to the reforms there 
were no economic incentives to promote 
the development of renewable energy 
technologies.
Since the energy reform was enacted, new investments are on hold. This is due to uncertainty and lack 
of information about the rules of the wholesale market 
and specific regulations to be issued following the 
Electricity Industry Law and the Energy Transition Law. 
In every case, regulatory certainty is essential for clear 
and transparent framework underpinning power sector 
operations.
The above sections dealt with the general characteristics of Mexico’s energy system today, some major 
administrative concerns, and particular cost and financing questions. All of these could create obstacles to 
renewable energy expansion. The next section discusses 
barriers to specific technologies, both by technology 
and by resource.
Regulatory certainty underpins the foundation of a clear and transparent framework for 
power sector operation, particularly since 
the energy reforms.
Wind
Wind power experienced the fastest growth in recent 
years, largely under self-supply schemes, as large energy-intensive companies find some of these projects 
economical. Nevertheless, much of the high quality 
resource potential identified remains untapped, mainly 
due to the lack of transmission capacity. The new regulations for expansion planning conferred on CENACE 
should help improve economic potential in windy regions.
Wind power plant construction, particularly in southern 
Mexico, has not always fully considered the interests of 
indigenous communities in the area. This has thwarted 
the construction of some approved wind projects. This 
is because information and consent on contracts, land 
lease agreements and compensations was withheld 
from local communities.
Solar PV
Solar PV technology is still under development, and its 
cost-competitiveness in most cases is limited. Nevertheless, solar PV electricity is used in some projects in Mexico. As of 2013, distributed PV capacity made up 40% of 
total installed solar PV capacity, or around 26 MW.
One of the main barriers to further penetration of distributed PV has been the lack of awareness among both 
types of users. People in towns may lack information 
on the benefits of solar PV rooftop installation, including potential energy bill savings. Meanwhile, rural and 
off-grid communities may lack information about the 
possibilities for off-grid or mini-grid electrification. Net-metering is included in the incentives remaining after 
the energy reform. This emphasises the need to draw 
up a specific plan for deploying smart grids to increase 
the beneficial services self-suppliers can provide to the 
system. This would help cut down barriers to rooftop 
solar PV.
Biomass
Supply constraints are the main barrier to power or heat 
generation from biomass. This starts with the complex 
and slow procedures for authorizing wood resource 
exploitation (REMBIO, 2011). Owners of wood resources, 
particularly in community schemes, do not have the 
training and organisation required to carry out the necessary studies to apply for wood exploitation permits. 
They may need to bear the extra cost of contracting 
services from third parties.
Another barrier is the high cost of long-distance transport, often making biomass unprofitable. This is exacerbated by the limited range of technologies for processing 
solid biomass. These need to be capable of producing 
biomass (chips, pellets etc.) with high calorific value, 
and would make transport more economical. At present 
there is a lack of finance for technology adaptations of 
this type in Mexico (REMBIO, 2011). Agriculture residues 
are susceptible to uncertainties due to variable seasonal 
availability. They may also be diverted to other nonenergy uses such as fertilisers or livestock feed (REMBIO, 
2011). Forest resource management in most parts of Latin 
America needs to improve, as Central America has the 
weakest record in sustainable forest management (FAO, 
2010) in the world. Mexico has made substantial progress 
against deforestation. However, this is still a critical issue if 
further natural resource degradation is to be avoided and 
sustainable feedstock supply improved.
Action needs to be taken to stimulate demand as well 
as sustainable and affordable biomass supply. Without 
clear and appropriate policies and targets, Mexico’s 
end-use sectors will easily continue to rely on fossil 
fuels. Hence realistic target-setting and new policies are 
required to take full advantage of this growing potential 
market for biomass and other renewables.
Geothermal
The main barrier to geothermal energy development is 
the high exploration costs, especially those associated 
with perforating wells needed to assess the technical 
and economic potential of estimated resources.
Private geothermal development is now feasible. Prior 
to the energy reform, geothermal exploration and production were reserved exclusively for the state, and 
private participation was restricted to obtaining concessions. Environmental standards for water quality were 
not clear or conducive to geothermal development. The 
Geothermal Energy Law enacted as part of the energy 
reform drew a distinction between geothermal and 
drinking water supplies. It set a framework for private 
entities to explore and exploit geothermal resources. 
This will create a new opportunity for geothermal energy deployment.
Small hydropower
Small hydropower projects face several barriers. One 
example is the lack of reliable assessments of generation potential. Another is high hydrological uncertainty 
caused by the lack of adequate basic meteorological 
and hydrometric information.
Administration and red tape gets in the way of permit 
acquisition for small hydropower projects. This is coupled with requirements for preliminary and feasibility 
studies, and long and complex multiple licensing procedures with federal, state and municipal authorities. The 
cost of adequate pre-feasibility studies is another concern, yet such studies are absolutely critical to clarifying 
the economic and environmental viability of a project 
before making an investment.This report has discussed the present energy situation, 
existing policy framework and barriers to renewables in 
Mexico. It has identified the potential to raise Mexico’s 
renewable energy share to 21% of TFEC by 2030. Based 
on these findings, this section provides a list of policy 
recommendations in five areas after consulting the national experts. They are listed below.
● establishing transition pathways for renewable 
energy
● creating an enabling business environment
● ensuring smooth renewables integration into the 
system
● creating and managing knowledge
● unleashing innovation
Planning transition pathways
Renewable energy development and use is a high priority for Mexico. The government has set clean energy 
generation and GHG emission reductions targets. The 
goals mandated by law for clean energy in the power 
sector are as follows:
1) no more than 65% supply of total power generation using fossil fuels by 2024
2) a 40% minimum of total electricity from clean 
energy by 2035
3) no more than 65% supply of total power generation using fossil fuels by 2050.
The first national targets for electricity generation by 
the various renewable sources were established by the 
Special Programme for the Development of Renewable 
Energies 2009-12 and 2014-18.
The national energy strategy is the main instrument for 
long-term planning in Mexico’s energy sector, prepared 
jointly by the National Energy Board (Consejo Nacional 
de Energía (CNE) and its Advisory Forum. It is subject to 
approval by Congress. By law, this document is updated 
every year, always with a 15 year time horizon.
Mexico’s energy policy went through a fundamental 
redesign at the end of 2013, and a progressive policy 
was put in place to accelerate renewable energy growth 
in the power sector. The present study shows there is 
potential to raise the share of modern renewable energy 
to 21% in TFEC by 2030.
Mexico is actively pursuing clean energy policies, mainly 
in the power sector, but this means overcoming an array 
of challenges and barriers. Long-term planning for the 
transmission grid is a major issue, especially as some of 
the additional renewables potential is in areas distant 
from the main national interconnected system. Moreover, annual installation rates for different technologies 
estimated according to REmap 2030 are significant. 
Equipment needs and the time required to install these 
capacities should be planned in tandem with related 
infrastructure development. This is especially important given the long distances between solar and wind 
resources and demand centres. Mexico has limited capacity of equipment manufacture today, a large share 
of which is geared for export. At the same time, Mexico 
imports a fair share of its renewables plant components. 
With the anticipated growth in demand for new equipment, it is hoped that domestic supply industries will 
broaden out, and that this trade balance will change. 
However, this will require massive investment. Policies 
and planning will be essential to developing competitive 
local players in the global market that base their growth 
on innovation and a skilled workforce.
A complete transition to clean energy needs to cover 
both the power and end-use sectors. As REmap 
2030 demonstrates, end-use sectors also show 
major renewable energy potential. Three quarters of 
Mexico’s TFEC is still related to energy use for heating 
and transport. Decisive investments in renewable 
technologies for end-use applications are increasingly 
possible as businesses invest in new manufacturing 
capacity, building stock and new kinds of passenger 
vehicles. But appropriate policies and incentives are 
needed to take advantage of this growing potential 
market.
9 SUGGESTIONS FOR ACCELERATED 
RENEWABLE ENERGY UPTAKEA considerable share of total renewable energy use in 
2030 will rely on modern forms of biomass, which can 
meet multiple industrial and residential energy needs. 
Under Remap 2030, the traditional biomass predominantly used for cooking and water heating in Mexico will 
be fully upgraded. The findings of this report yield the 
suggestions listed below for planning transition pathways to 2030 in Mexico.
These incentives and special arrangements should in 
principle only work during a transitional period and 
should not create a permanently privileged class of 
energy producers. The final objective is a permanently 
competitive and profitable renewables industry.
Recommendations
● Ensure that the Special Program for the Use of 
Renewable Energy targets is pursued as a first 
step to realizing REmap 2030 potential.
● Develop an adequate, ambitious and timely electricity transmission plan that guarantees potential renewable power deployment.
● Reinforce the recently enacted Geothermal Energy Law with appropriate requirements for 
sustainable long-term geothermal resource exploitation, incorporating the vast experience developed in geothermal exploitation by CFE.
● Incentivise industry development to improve local expertise and increase the national supply of 
renewable energy technology components and 
equipment.
● Expand the current short-term modern cook 
stove programme to a long-term strategy to 
accelerate the full replacement of traditional biomass, with an emphasis on financing schemes for 
low-income users.
● Set more ambitious liquid biofuels targets and 
create programmes to create a business case 
for EVs.
● Set up a supportive policy, planning and regulatory framework to foster significant and affordable biomass supply for industrial CHP and solar 
water heating.
● Foster and extend policies that ensure the sustainable development and use of biomass resources.
● Integrate green energy policies in regulations 
for new buildings construction to facilitate the 
extended adoption of PV and solar water heating 
in this sector.
Creating an enabling business 
environment
Policy support to improve the cost-effectiveness of 
renewable energy technologies is a key step in supporting their deployment during the transition period 
from now until 2030. Improving cost-effectiveness can 
start with the efficient reduction and allocation of costs 
and risks and the related uncertainties in renewable 
energy investments. Policy frameworks that create appropriate conditions conducive to efficient investment 
will increase the confidence of investors implementing projects and attracting sources of finance at both 
national and international levels. The most important 
considerations in the long run are the need for efficient 
investment and for renewable energy to truly compete 
with fossil fuels without special considerations on either 
side. Until such conditions predominate, a number of 
measures could be taken during the transition period to 
increase renewable energy attractiveness and engineer 
a larger renewables market share by targeted policy 
choices.
It will be important to ensure adequate conditions are 
created for integrating small-scale projects into the 
market and for diversifying ownership structure in the 
energy sector. This will create local jobs and benefit 
consumers. The financing challenges for smaller capacity projects will need to be resolved in the short term as 
an increasing share of investments is likely to be needed 
for such capacity.
Appropriate subsidies are a sensitive issue when 
defining the business environment. At the moment, 
diesel and petrol used in transport, LPG, some 
renewables and most electricity tariffs are in some way 
subsidised. A policy rationale of some kind has been 
used to justify each of these subsidies. For a country 
trying to expand renewable energy deployment, the 
balance of existing subsidies is a matter of concern. 
The government is planning to revise its subsidies. 
If this revision results in an economic balance, as 
considered in the REmap 2030 business perspective, 
this would make a significant impact on the business 
case for renewables in Mexico.Recommendations
● Through effective economic, financial and/or fiscal incentives, establish a market where renewables are cost-competitive to realise the medium 
and long-term renewable energy objectives (i.e. 
clean energy targets to 2018, 2024 etc.)
● Ensure that the recently created CEC scheme is 
fully up and running and effective to achieve the 
targets set.
● Design power exchange rules that support the efficient participation of renewable energy generators and ensure grid access for all technologies.
● Draw up adequate rules for grid connection, access and cost-sharing to guarantee renewable 
power development.
● Ensure that clear and publicly available information on administrative procedures for renewable 
energy development is effectively communicated across the whole stakeholder spectrum.
Ensuring smooth integration of 
renewables into the system
Particular attention needs to be paid to the large-scale 
integration of different renewable energy technologies 
in different sectors. Three main challenges emerge here. 
The first is the high share of variable renewables (wind 
and solar PV) reaching about 25% of total power generation in REmap 2030. The second is the high share 
of distributed solar PV capacity and solar thermal that 
would require planning for the most effective use of 
rooftops on Mexican buildings. The third is related to 
ensuring an fully operational supply of modern biomass, 
and its substitution for traditional biomass use.
Expanding transmission capacity will be essential to 
deliver utility-scale generation from remote northern 
areas rich in resources to demand hubs in central and 
southern Mexico. Infrastructure related to grid integration of variable renewables in Mexico has not been 
studied in detail using power system models. This will 
need to be rectified in the years to come as the share 
of variable renewables grows. Technological solutions, 
suitable measures and the requisite policy support 
appropriate to Mexico’s specific character need to be 
better understood.
REmap 2030 estimates that up to three out of ten roofs 
in Mexico by 2030 would need to be covered by either a 
solar PV or solar water heating unit. This is an ambitious 
share. However, if the right policy support and planning 
is provided, and space efficiently shared between the 
two technologies, it can be realised for new build between now and 2030.
Mexico’s total renewable energy mix does not include 
much modern biomass. However, REmap 2030 shows 
that it could account for one third of the total renewable energy use. Some of this is due to the substitution 
of traditional biomass use with modern solid biomass 
and biogas. The other factor is combined process heat 
and power generation in the manufacturing industry 
or in stand-alone separate heat and power generation 
systems. This level of demand for modern biomass 
applications does not exist in Mexico at the moment. 
Effective and efficient use of modern biomass is largely 
limited to plants whose byproducts are used on site 
(e.g., bagasse). Unless new policies are put in place, 
the cost-effective potential estimated in 2030 would 
most likely not be deployed. Policies are also needed on 
the supply side to address sustainable and affordable 
biomass sourcing. The supply potential of bioenergy, 
limited to biogas and a mix of agricultural and forest 
residues, has been conservatively estimated. It would 
be grossly insufficient to fully utilise the estimated volume of biomass use potential by 2030 identified in this 
study. Instead, dedicated and sustainably grown energy 
crops would need to supplement this residue supply 
potential. This in turn would require an integrated policy 
approach starting from water and land use planning to 
changing agricultural practices. Policies would need to 
orchestrate input from a variety of industries producing 
relevant byproducts. Another strategy to make the best 
use of limited biomass supply potential is to reduce 
thermal energy demand by improving energy efficiency 
or to increase the efficiency of renewable electricity 
technology alternatives.
Recommendations
● Build grid infrastructure that can accommodate 
variable renewable energy shares up to 26%, and 
secure the necessary financing for this task.
● Set clear rules for power system operation, including grid codes, rules for dispatch and curtail-ment, ancillary services etc. that foster better 
renewables deployment and dispatch.
● Adjust power system operational practices to 
give greater flexibility, implementing accurate 
renewable generation forecast systems, shorter 
gate closure timeframes, larger balancing areas 
and subhourly updates of dispatch schedules.
● Ensure the isolated Baja California and Baja California Sur power systems are connected to the 
national grid to make their solar and wind potential fully available.
● Strengthen decentralised power generation 
through appropriate legislative frameworks. 
These need to allow diverse ownership structures and self-supplier involvement, simplified 
administrative procedures, net-metering/billing 
schemes and advanced metering infrastructure.
● Draw up legislation and power market rules that 
allow new players to participate in the energy 
service market, permitting aggregation of generation, demand-side and storage.
● Develop a working biomass feedstock market to 
ensure sustainable and affordable supply by considering the nexus between sectors that (jointly) 
produce, transport and use these feedstocks. 
Develop the infrastructure to utilise the major 
biogas potential to its full extent locally.
Creating and managing knowledge
Mexico is beginning to shape its energy system so 
that it accepts more renewables. Policy changes and 
long-term targets give great hope that Mexico’s large 
solar, wind and bioenergy potential will be significantly 
utilised. However, the sustainable transition to renewable energy, planning for renewables integration, and 
the creation of a business environment conducive to 
renewables require good knowledge management. This 
means modern intelligence on renewable technologies, 
market conditions and economic realities alongside 
well-managed research. Knowledge and analysis of this 
calibre is required for the entire renewables value chain. 
This ranges from resource to impact assessments on the 
environment or the economy.
Recommendations
● Improve awareness of potential renewable energy use and energy efficiency in buildings among 
manufacturers, users and project developers/
installers.
● Develop a network integrating capacity-building 
skills and human resources, linking and expanding the science/technology/business axis.
● Develop power system models incorporating 
higher shares of variable renewable energy in 
power generation, transmission and system operation. This yields an understanding of the optimal solutions for ensuring security of power 
generation supply in the long and short term.
● Critically assess the socio-economic and environmental impacts of renewable energy projects, 
and communicate this clearly to all stakeholders.
● Embed technology standards, certification and 
control for component and equipment supply 
and installation.
● Improve the assessment of renewable energy 
potential presented in INERE to ensure the best 
data available by accounting for technical, economic and sustainability constraints.
Unleashing innovation
Under REmap 2030, Mexico’s modern renewable energy 
share can reach 21% with existing technologies. This compares with 4.4% for 2010. This is an impressive growth 
potential, especially since it can be reached using existing 
technologies alone. However, there is no guarantee that 
21% will be attained by 2030, which in any case is not the 
final goal. There is potential to exceed this. Technology 
innovation will play a key role in realizing the REmap 
2030 potential. Innovation can lead to new technologies 
with more efficient processes, enduring and better quality equipment that can help improve the profitability of renewable energy projects. Technology innovation can 
also help commercialise new and emerging renewable 
energy alternatives like advanced biofuels or energy and 
wood crops in various end-use applications. Little or no 
potential for these has been identified thus far.
Recommendations
● Improve government support for innovation, research and development to cut renewable energy costs and improve technical efficiencies.
● Provide incentives for research and development 
in renewables and extend the Energy Sustainability Fund (Fondo Sectorial en Sustentabilidad 
Energética, FSE) to exploit capacity building and 
innovation in renewable energy
● Continue consolidating partnerships for innovation in wind, solar and geothermal.
● Promote the activities of the various Mexican 
Energy Innovation Centres. These investigate 
scientific and technological solutions for administrative, logistical and economic problems affecting sustainable energy expansion in Mexico.
● Develop technologies to increase sustainable 
energy crops and forest wood supply.
● Improve energy efficiency and the electrification 
of end-use sectors to reduce dependency on 
biomass.REFERENCES
